The first 10 hours of the game or so, maybe a little bit less, 8 hours - seem magical, astounding and absolutely amazing. It reminds you of old masterpieces - dungeon keeper, Knights and Merchants, even survival games. It's all great - I mean you can dig, create stuff, decorate it, smash monsters, level gnomes up, craft, you can craft a lot. More advanced crafting requires gnomes with specific skills. So the idea's great, you unlock more and more recipes by crafting newly unlocked stuff, the world seems a better place with this game around.\n\nAnd then you get to midgame.\nYou start lacking resourses, especially the most important resourse ingame - iron, which is non-renewable. You start going to edges of the map, which takes gnomes forever to just reach, not to mention they prefer spending their time doing something you didn't really even ask them to do. Even with teleportation to the right place, you just no longer control them, the AI gets dumber the more you build and explore, while gnomes never get faster, nor you get a huge army of them. By midgame you require at least 5 times the amount of gnomes you have!\n\nThe crafting turns into hell, because you need to unlock 5-10-15 more levels to reach a needed crafting level by crafting stuff you clearly do not need need in huge amounts: like 50 book cases, or 15 stone statues. You exhaust your resourses on trash, just to get over it. You also got to build that trash, which requires you to use pretty inconvinient system of placing the newly crafted item into one of 20 fast access slots, which in midgame are already filled out with important things like spells, food, walls, bridges etc. And then restore the previous one the same way.\n\nBy that time you get the feeling that you'd rather stare at the wall doing nothing, than play on.\nAwful late game balance and AI management completely kills the game.\n\nBut at least you can enjoy first 8-12 hours.","November 20, 2014","false","15.9"," 798 of 980 people (81%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","81","798","980","16","40"

Great value for money! You will get 30 hours of fun out of this game, which makes it money well spent.\n\nWhat happens that makes it a mind numbing tedious grind? Basically there are 3 worlds. You start the first and work your way up in tech to fight the final bosses and move on to the next world.  Now here is the kick to the nuts, every time you start a new world, you start completely over!! I started my third world and couldn't take it anymore. The worlds are a little different so that is kinda fun, but the tech is the same.  Grind fest by gameplay hour 40.\n\nStill, would reccomend you try it. 30 hours of fun!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lowen/recommended/248390/","Lowen","Lowen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lowen/","857 products in account","This is a nice 2d dwarf management game, kind of like a mix between Dwarf Fortress, Terraria and Minecraft. I've enjoyed the time I've spent playing it and I recommend it.\n\nHowever, it does have a few problems.\n\nI wish levels didn't take so long to complete: I've played this game for 60 hours and I've only completed 2&1/2 levels. There's no real reason for the game to be so slow, there's just not much to do on a map after you've secured your fort except more of the same stuff you've been doing from the beginning.\n\nThere's a research tree, but it sucks. New techs have too many prerequisites. You need all of the prerequisites and most of them don't make any sense. Resetting the tech tree each level is also pointless and just makes levels take longer.\n\nDwarfs are also pretty dumb and still get lost while pathfinding. They'll also gather up junk resources like dirt and sand which you simply won't ever need or want again after a certain point.\n\nI'm not sure why this game has a Minecraft style crafting grid either. It just means every time I want to make something I need to drag each item onto the grid. There's no need for this, the game gives you the recipe, it could just give you an inventory count for the ingredients on the crafting grid so that you could make stuff and be aware of how many of your raw resources you're using without any dragging.\n\nLast but not least I would say the game is very easy. Just kit out all your dwarfs with some good weapons and armor. A few melee dwarfs and the rest with bows or wizard staffs and you're set. You can also just armor your base well and wait out the hourly monster sieges.\n\nI guess that's a long list of complaints but I really do enjoy building up my fortress and fending off the monster waves while I gradually expand my mines deeper and further away.","December 19, 2014","true","74.2"," 215 of 241 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","215","241","6","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hereticalpha/recommended/248390/","hereticalpha","HereticAlpha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hereticalpha/","260 products in account","Please don't let the Negative review fool you- Craft the World can be a really fun game when it wants to be. I bought this game after Terraria, Gnomoria and Dwarf Fortress were feeling a little stale, and after reading that from the Store Page that it draws so much from similar games, I thought "Well, this is the game for me!"\n\nCtW does a LOT right- it has a great allocation of resources, a Tech Tree that rewards the player (though still in need of a good bit of work on some of the later technologies), graphics that inspire a friendly and positive player experience, and a great base-building simulation.\n\nSo why is it a Negative review?\n\nBecause it's a Mobile game. Everything about CtW reeks of "The App Store is our major goal". No key bindings, a crafting menu COMPLETELY designed around touchscreens, and even a big Dwarf holding an iPad when you load up the game just ruins the experience for me. Despite it's initial release on Steam, Craft the World makes PC users feel like an afterthought. Everything is dragging, everything is awkward, and you'll need to head to the wiki if you want to figure out any Hotkey shortcuts. However, my overall negative review comes from more than a moral standing-\n\nThe game fails to deliver on population management completely. If you select an enemy, ALL of yours Dwarves will drop everything they do to fight it. If you mine a tunnel, you're going to have a conga line of Dwarves picking up resources in the LEAST sensible way possible. If you start a task, cancel it, and restart it, you're going to have a Dwarf standing around while another Dwarf, often from the other side of the map, comes to handle the task for some odd reason.\n\nThe Evil Portal event feels like an artificial restraint on my fun, making me have to pause everything I'm doing for a night while trying to herd my Dwarves into their home quick enough to survive, and the zombie waves are just a lot of "keep smacking them until they go away(win)/until they break your door down(lose). The Goblin events are frustrating at best; I don't know how the developer thought putting in a random surge of enemies without ANY warning would be a great idea, but it's still more fun than the Evil Portal event.\n\nA lot of mechanics are frustrating to deal with and calling them unintuitive would be a major complement. Selecting a single space and having four different options for that space pop up makes me think "How much better could this have been if they'd put effort into making it better for Mouse/Keyboard users?"\n\nAll in all, Craft the World is fun. Sometimes. Every time I play this game, it wants me to have all the fun in the world, right up until it trips over its own shoelaces and falls face-first onto the floor. When Dekvoir makes a release better tailored for PC users, I'll gladly change my review. Until then, don't pick the game up until it goes on sale.","November 28, 2015","false","14.0"," 381 of 460 people (83%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","83","381","460","16","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198062930115/recommended/248390/","76561198062930115","DG Dobrev","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198062930115/","403 products in account","After much deliberation, I decided to give the thumbs up to this game - but with a bunch of stuff in mind.\n\nFirst thing's first - the developers made true on their promise, and this game is indeed a mix of Dungeon Keeper (you can control one of your dwarves, which is actually recommended during difficult encounters), Terraria (2D mining, hidden underground rooms and enemies, nighttime attacks) and Dwarf Fortress - well, dwarves and equipment for them.\n\nSecondly - this is not a game that will keep you glued to your PC as your dwarves are being killed left and right. Actually, this is a game that doesn't really take itself seriously - you have unlimited freedom over the things your dwarves do - sometimes, it is just as fun to watch them go about their daily stuff (sleep, snore, eat, talk to each other, make funny sounds, etc.). It is a pure sandbox game with some survival factor. Let your creative juices flow, and build yourself a nice fortress or castle. Experiment and take pleasure in it - completing the level isn't really mandatory. Sometimes just making something cool looking just to screenshot it and post it somewhere is just as much fun as completing a level. With that in mind, be aware that your little dwarves will ♥♥♥♥ you the hell off quite often.\n\nAs far as replayability goes, you can expect to be dumping a lot of hours in it. Completing a single level is 12+ hours on a small map.\n\nLet's quickly outline what's good and what's bad about this game.\n\nThe Good:\n- Sandbox game with huge replayability\n- Very pleasant graphics and cute dwarves making all kinds of funny sounds\n- Rewarding exploration of the world above and below\n- Extensive tech tree\n- Promotes creativity\n- Player is actively involved in everything that happens\n- personally, I haven't played a more relaxing game in a long time, without feeling any constraints or need to finish a level\n\nThe Bad:\n- Dwarfs AI - the dwarves are plain stupid (look at me using both US and GB plurals in one sentence). Hmm... on a second thought, that is an understatement. They are brain dead and really need you to react to situations or just plain do something before you start... um... how to put it mildly so I don't get banned... Ricking your dipps off.\n-- And this is a huge gripe. It outweighs everything else. If you do nothing, you will see your dwarves doing the same idiotic thing over and over again, likely resulting in death. Example: in a Boss fight (Big Undead Guys with lots of HP, good armor, using sword attacks and hurling fireballs which you need to kill to advance to the next level) if you lose a dwarf or two before the fight is over, you are in very deep sh... trouble. Unless you explicitely order your dwarves to stay inside the shelter, they will go one by one to pick ther fallen comrades valuable gear, in essence getting slaughtered themselves in the process. You can decimate a whole 10+ dwarven colony like that easily. HOpe you have nerves of steel and don't ragequit.\n- the pathfinding - oftentimes you will see the dwarves taking weird paths to their goals (can be remedied with portals, thank god)\n- Techs need grinding - unless you have something specific in mind, expect to be building the same thing over and over to advance to the next tech\n- Resources are limited - some resources can be recrafted (like coal) but the valuable ores (iron-mithril) can't, so you might face a mineral shortage\n- Bosses can be cheesed out - if you manage to put the turret just outside their range and you are patient enough, you will have yourself a dead boss.\n\nConclusion: as you see, only the combat part of the game is actually a problem. Everything else promotes casual gameplay, sandbox feeling, relaxation, laughs and smiles all around. I would characterize this game as a builder with softcore survival elements. It is the perfect thing for the casual gamer who likes to throw in an hour or two in it, have some fun and switch it off. If you are a hardcore survival game fan, stay away from it, as you will likely be terribly disappointed.","February 28, 2015","true","31.1"," 135 of 142 people (95%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","95","135","142","16","5"

It has the basis to be great as long as you understand that this is an Early Access game meaning there is a lot more to come.\n\nBetter graphics than Terraria and does everything different enough to keep it interesting.  Instead of a single hero, you get a team of dwarves to do your bidding.\n\nTough to rate an Early Access game and would suggest Steam considers against it.  Tough to speak negatively in a review on an Early Access game when I have no idea what will be added until considered released.  So at this point, all I will say is it has the basis to be one of the great ones.\n\nUpdate #1 (3/1/14):   The dev continues to update this game, it continues to get better and I still feel that it has a strong enough foundation to be considered great.  Add mods and this could be legendary.\n\nUpdate #2 (4/14/14):    Same as the last update.  The game is continually being updated with fixes and additions.  A perfect example of what I expect from an Early Access game, and trust me when I say that it's only a small fraction of EA games that get updated this frequently.","November 25, 2013","true","53.6"," 149 of 181 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","149","181","0","0"

I've been on Steam for years now, and this is the first review I've ever written here. While I've enjoyed other games as much, or more than this one, what made me want to write a review, is how "quiet" this game has been. For being so immensely fun, I had never heard of it, quite the sleeper, even more so than Terraria was.\n\nI'm a big fan of Minecraft, Terraria, Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, and Don't Starve. This title is definitely as good as those, combining elements of all of them but still delivering a unique gameplay experience. The graphics are superb for what I've come to expect from this genre, and add a lot of character to the game. If it didn't have the "Early Access" label I wouldn't have known it was.\n\nDo not let the "Early Access" label stop you from trying this if you've had bad experiences with them before, so have I (Towns, Castle Story.)  This is not like those and will definitely deliver. The fact that the developers consider this early access makes me really excited to see what else they have in mind for the game, and it gets updated quite frequently.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is the lack of a job priority system like other village management games have, and it can really frustrating here. As of the writing of this review, I frequently have to de-construct/re-construct crafting stations to get my dwarves to craft at all, and their highest priority seems to be hauling right now. Great. -.-\n\nI've gotten used to the system now, but it has numerous quirks the player will have to learn and get used to. I could definitely see less patient or experienced gamers quickly getting frustrated with their dwarves and some of the glitchy behavior.\n\nThat aside, unlike almost every title I mentioned above, the game comes with a built-in tutorial and task-based system to guide you through the game. I really liked this and thought it was really well done. For those who don't like to have their hand held or just want more freedom, there is a custom sandbox style mode that has a few settings to play around with.\n\nTL, DR: Great "Early Access" game that doesn't play like "Early Access" at all! If you enjoy Minecraft, Terraria, Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Don't Starve or any other game like this, add this title to your collection!","January 20, 2014","true","149.2"," 86 of 99 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","86","99","0","0"

Looks good from the outset but it's really poorly designed. The biggest and most pervasive issue is it takes way too long to get anything done. I put in at least 15 hours to complete the first world and almost all of that was waiting around while making decisions of very little value.\n\n\nThe Dwarf AI is really terrible. Their prioritisation is all over the place. You'll have a dwarf with 90% mining skill and your best pick cutting trees while your brand new dwarf with no skills and no gear will be haplessly hacking away at the toughest rock in the game.  Your cook won't cook. You'll set a job to kill a chicken and find every dwarf you have chasing it around the map. Possibly worst of all - your dwarves regularly refuse to pick up after themselves, rendering all the work you (finally) got them to do moot. What's the point of chopping down trees to collect wood if they never bring the damn wood back to the storehouse? This last complaint is mitigated somewhat by the spells you receive later in the game but they are neither a solution and they invoke the game's fairly terrible magic system (but I won't get into that).\n\nThe tech tree is really awful. It's mostly linear - if you recognise a tech further down the tree you need you generally have to unlock everything that comes before it, regardless of that tech's use to your or relation to the tech you want. Perhaps this is somewhat permissable as a way of gating your progression through the game, fine (though its a terrible one). But when the tech tree is 50% useless decorative elements it's just infruriating. Decorative stuff does have some use in the game (though its effectiveness is extremely unclear) but generally you'll be forced to produce far more than you'll even have the room to use, let alone the desire. In a game where it can be hugely frustrating to produce the items you  DO need - like a sharper axe - it's just insane to have to sit through the AI's nonsense and the giant travel times to produce items that have both no use and have been forced on you by lazy developers.\n\nTo add to the nonsense and the endless walking-in-molasses feeling of playing this game, the items that are most useful - extra stockpiles, minecarts and elevators - are all at the very end of the tech tree. After spending the whole game managing dwarf travel times with the portal system (again, utilising the terrible magic system), actually reliable and interesting transport solutions show up at the point in time I didn't need them anymore - I could have just finished the game at the point I was at and was simply closing out the tech tree.\n\nThere's heaps of other issues I could get into (holy crap the 'Minecraft inspired' craft system is awful) but I'd be here all day.\n\nI do not recommend this game.","December 12, 2014","false","20.3"," 294 of 408 people (72%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","72","294","408","7","7"

I can't understand how the hell this game has positive reviews, because there is something that absolutely RUIN the game from the go : AI, pathfinding and the crafting tree.\n\nAI and pathfinding\n\n- imagine that two of your dwarves successfully climbed down ( I mean, fell down) a dirt wall, and now they are unable to climb up again with their spiderman-like powers. So they stay there doing nothing. What do you do ? Hey ! you have two ladders in your inventory, let's put them just beside the dwarves, right ? Do you think those dwarves can put the ladder here ? HELL NO ! Another dwarf needs to come from the other side of the map to put the ladders, while the other two morons just stay here watching.\n\nPS : I KNOW I can place objects by controlling a dwarf, but it's really slow, boring, and a stupid game mechanic. Why would a dwarf suddenly have the whole stock available ? Why can't they access the inventory without my intervention ? Or why can't I just make stuff spawn beside them ? Am I some ghost with no physical body but I can somehow hold a bag with ladders and stuff and only use them by controlling the body of someone ? Makes no sense at all.\n\n- now imagine that you put some platform across water so they don't need to swim all the way. Do you think they are gonna put the first platform, walk on it, put the second one, etc ? HELL NO ! A first dwarf will put one platform and go home, while a second dwarf swim to the other side and put a platform, and then others dwarfs will come, swim, try to achieve the bridge, get stuck in the water because somehow they can't jump back up. And once the "bridge" is finally complete after 30min, do you think the dwarves will use it ? HELL NO ! They'll walk on the first platform and then jump through the second into the water, and drown.\n\n- now imagine that you need wool to make ropes, used to craft really important stuff like armors. You send a dwarf to kill a sheep at the end of the map, because there is never  a sheep near your camp. Do you think the dwarf will pick up the wool and meat in his empty backpack ? HELL NO ! They send another dwarf from the other end of the map to pick that stuff up, like, 1 hour after.\n\n- now imagine that you put a table somewhere. A dwarf needs to come here and put the table. unfortunately, by the time he arrives, there is a FU KING SNAIL on the table spot, so the action is CANCELED ! AND THOSE FU KING SNAILS SPAWN EVERYWHERE BLOCKING PATHS !\n\n- now imagine you're playing another RTS. You do ask your drones/villagers/whatever to gather some stone. Do you need to tell them to gather the stone in front to acces the second row of stones ? Of course not, they're not stupid. DWARVES ARE ! They will gather ressources without taking into account if they are destroying their path to gather more ressources ! It's the same when building, you can't fu king build a wall and a roof 3 blocks tall because they can only reach a height of 2 blocks, so it will take hours to put ladders everywhere. And everytime they put a block, it resets the pathfinding and the placement of other blocks gets canceled ! You have to manually put one block at a time waiting 5 minutes between each that a dwarf comes...\n\nI could go on with the stupid AI but I'm only at the beginning of the game and it's already driving me crazy. I can't even imagine what's it's like with more dwarves, more enemies and more stuff to do, when you have to micromanage every action to be sure they don't get stuck doing sh*t somewhere.\n\nThe crafting tree\n\nAt first I thought the crating tree was nice, compared to games like Terraria where you need a wiki to actually know what the hell you're supposed to do. Then I realized that you need to waste a lot of ressource to craft 10 stuff you don't need just to access the next technology ( if we can call a bucket a technology ), like in stupid MMOs.\n\nAnd then I realized that you need coal to cook something and the only coal I found was at the other side of the map, and I'd better kill myself rather than wait 2 hours for a dwarf to go there and gather coal. Oh but look ! A SHOP ! I'm gonna buy some coal. So... it's in my inventory right ? RIGHT ? HELL NO ! The coal is on the ground and a dwarf has to gather it, but they are all busy mining, fighting or doing nothing ( yes because doing nothing in this game is a queued action it seems ). So after 30 minutes I finally got the coal, so I can finally cook some meat. Right ? HELL NO ! After you craft the meat, a dwarf needs to cook it at a cooking campfire. Yes, a specific cooking campfire, because you can't cook meat, like, on a simple fire ?\n\nThen I realized that the crafting section to build a stone wall was really far away and that it would take hours to have it, so I stopped playing.

For reference, some of my favorite games are Gnomoria and Dwarf Fortress, though I did enjoy Terraria a lot.\n\nFirst the good:\n* Cute art and adorable dwarves.\n* Detailed and interesting world design, though with very limited ecology.\n* Deep and varied tech tree.\n* Solid-seeming tech foundation for a builder/sim game.\n* Ant farm full of dwarves!\n\nThe bad:\n* Terrible user interface:\n* tons of superfluous click-and-drag for crafting -- it gives you the recipe but you still have to click and drag into a grid. Maybe for the first time but subsequently producing an item should be easy. Few games make me long for DF's UI.\n* generally lacking polish -- highlighting items won't tell you what they are, meaning you spend time guessing what an icon/sprite means. You cannot speedup time and the game proceeds at a glacial pace, a 2/4/8x bar would be nice, especially in early game.\n* obnoxious leveling system -- this is by far the worst part of the game. You don't tech up by building structures, doing research, etc, nor is the entire tech tree available ala Banished -- you tech up in two ways. By crafting 10 ladders you don't need so you can make torches, etc, and by "unlocking" recipes that are "locked" by earning XP -- yes, a builder game with XP grinding, like some casual Facebook game. this mechanic might be able to be kept in if improved, but as it stands it just makes the early game a boring, frustrating clickfest. And the game pauses while crafting, which compounds the already slow speed.\n\nI know these sound like minor complaints, but taken together they really ruin what could be an enjoyable experience. This game has solid technical design and ideas, but I'm not sure where the authors are going with it; the concerns I mention raise alarm bells, for me at least.\n\nI still got some enjoyment out of the game (not done playing yet), and it might be worth picking up on sale, but I really can't advise paying $15 in the current state. Maybe once the dev gets further along or the price drops.","April 13, 2014","false","2.5"," 546 of 845 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","546","845","0","29"

It has a somewhat less ambitious scale but that is perfect in that it makes the game accessible and opens up this style of game to a much larger audience of gamers.\n\nA lot of people have misconceptions about this game and seem to be comparing it to Terraria or Starbound which is really a faulty comparison. This game is nothing like those. This is more like a strategy/simulation game in which you manage your resources and utilize your dwarf's time wisely.\n\nThe graphics and music for Craft the World are top notch. The big sprites change appearance to reflect the armor/weapons you give them. The luch color palette is easy on the eyes and makes identifying different types of material easy.\n\nFor an Early Access game this is in amazing shape. No crashes for me in 20 hours of play and very few bugs. The balance feels good and really it seems the only thing the game needs before going gold is more content (which they are working on, we should have another world soon).\n\nIf you are on the fence about this game I encourage you to give it a shot. If you are fascinated by the Dwarf Fortress style of game but are daunted by DF itself and found the other DF mass market attempts wanting as I did then have no fear this is not another Towns.\n\nThis game was one of my big surprises of the year and I believe before all is said and done I'll be putting 100+ hours into it once all of the difficulty levels are implemented.\n","December 21, 2013","true","77.6"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","35","36","0","0"

Did you like Dungeon Keeper?\nThen give CtW a chance even if it may not look like it could be interesting to you!\n\nI've playing since release, and knew this cute little bugger will make it to release and now it finally did!\nAnd it just got better :-)\n\nWhat it's all about?\n\nYou control the world like you do in Dungeon keeper. You say dig here, build there, gather this, kill these. And the dwarfs will decide when to do what.\nYour job is to...\nkeep them alive (craft good and diverse food, watch what you'll attack and so on)\nupgrade their weapons and armory\ngive them jobs (they level in up to 3 specialisations each like fighter, miller, smith, archer etc.)\nloot ruins & discover secrets\nfind rare ores\nbuild a nice shelter to increase the comfort so everyone is happy and can chill in their luxury bed\ncraft things to be able to craft other things with these things that finally let you craft this one thing to...do...thingsOne example:\nNeed fish for a recipe but there is none? Build a pool with a bridge, gather snow, craft ice, put ice on bridge, watch ice melt, water drops into pool. Rinse, repeat until fish consider your pool frigging awesome and move in. NOW GO FISHING!\n\nIf things get complicated you could, like in Dungeon Keeper, control one dwarf and do it yourself!\n\nSo what are the positive aspects?\nAddictive gameplay\nIn 3 playthroughs (which will take quite a while) i have not discovered a single bug or crash. Looks more done like many major AAA-titles that call themselves "finals"\nThe dwarf-AI is considerably clever. They pretty much always do what you want WHEN you want them to. E.g. they're busy crafting 100 ores and you want ONE weapon NOW? They will probably make that ONE weapon and continue back to their original task. Somethings laying around somewhere? They'll get it as soon as time permits and so on.\n3 different worlds. Well ok, differences are marginal and mainly only visible on the surface but at least it gives some replayability-value\nMusic and sound effects are pretty fitting and not annoying even after hours\nRegular updates, the dev seems very commited. While being in EA that is.\nBut there are negative aspects too:\nThe UI could really be optimized in some aspects (like said in most negative reviews). Crafting can become a pretty frustrating finger-click-party\nEven though the AI is pretty cool, some things suck like building narrow trenches where they start at the beginning not the end and can't continue. You either have to do one block after another or control a dwarf and do it yourself\nSandbox-mode can get pretty frustrating if you're needing one special recipe but EVERYTHING ELSE drops first and you're stuck doing nothing (recipes drop randomly while diggin instead of a tech-tree)\nMost people find the tech-tree stupid. Although it can sometimes be very stupid (craft 10 of this one thing you don't need but would need the resources, just to be able to craft the next tier) it still makes sense and gives a sense of progression and a target to work for.\nSome people seem to have problems with the AI. Well, *I* never had any and i played through 3 or 4 times yet.\nNearing the end of a map, resources can become scarce as they don't respawn/regrow. So if you need ONE stupid Gold-ore to reach the end and you've wasted all gold for cute gold-fishes (bad pun!) and gold-doors and goold-spoons and goldened silver and gold...you get the point? :-)\ntl;dr:\nConsidering the cheap price, this game is a keeper! It's also now one of the shining examples of Early Access.\nI *LOVE* Dungeon Keeper and played it a thousand times and this cute fellow comes pretty close (gameplay wise not visually). Although it's still quite different (instead of War For The Overworld) it's more than enough to keep you hooked.\n\nMore depth? Try Gnomoria!\nMore casual but still quite complex?

If you enjoy exploring a new game for yourself, then you perhaps don't want to watch it!\n\nGeneralI bought Craft the World about a year ago during Early Access. This game has been a good experience for me. Although there was a bit of a rollercoaster when it's OS requirements got changed from a minimum of Snow Leopard to Lion. A few of us objected to the basic OS requirements being changed because it meant we could no longer play the game, and the dev did change it back. I was very appreciative that he listened to us and was able to stick to the original game requirements.\n\nHowever, you want to know whether the game is fun, not how honourable the devs might be. It's very fun, although sometimes I question why it is because it can get quite monotonous and I begin asking myself what the point is. And yet I keep playing.\n\nGameplayYou control a bunch of dwarves. As you gain exp you gain levels, and with each new level you get another dwarf. Don't panic if a dwarf dies, because after a few minutes (you'll see the timer) he will respawn. You get your dwarves to execute two major actions - dig, and build. They will also gather materials that are on the ground by themselves. It may not sound like much, but now consider the zombie hordes that will spawn as the game progresses. You need to build strong walls and a good defence against them. The ultimate goal of each level is to complete five portal pieces to rebuild the portal and move onto the next world. If you're the sort that likes building games though, you will definitely get distracted along the way as you experiment with building a fortress for your dwarves.\n\nControlsAlthough you can control everything with the mouse alone, it makes life easier to use the keyboard. WASD lets you pan around, and there are various hotkeys for selecting dwarves and telling them to go eat or sleep.\n\nStorylineThere isn't really much of one. I'm not sure why I'm controlling these dwarves and sending them through portals. I have no idea why there are dragons. I haven't even grasped why the zombie hordes are attacking me. But considering how many hours of my life I've already had consumed by this game, I guess I don't really care too much either!\n\nSoundIt can get a little monotonous, but on the other hand I find the music is quite addicting. I'll find it starts playing in my head when I feel like coming back to Craft the World for another session. The music is informative, telling you whether or not you're under attack, or whether it is night time. Otherwise, there isn't anything phenomenal here, the sound supports the game.\n\nGraphicsAn interesting art style that I quite enjoy. The inventory and crafting screens are a bit clunky in their design and functionality, but they get the job done. I enjoy the bright colours and the various monsters. The trees are quite fun to watch grow and get chopped down. An important tip for players concerned with aesthetics - for things like paintings you can right click a painting with a painting and it will change the image that is being displayed.\n\nPros+ addictive and fun to explore the world and build a fort\n+ digging\n+ building\n+ hotkeys\n+ zombie hordes to destroy\nCons- bit of a clunky UI\n- not sure why I'm playing it\n- dwarves are stupid, and with time they get even dumber (dwarf AI needs work)\n\nHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you.

Won't satisfy any hardcore gamers' gaming appitite. However, it is a great game to pick up and play for those casual moments.\n\nThis game is a lot like Terraria meets Dwarves. A bit of a mix and match genre. You have your 'craft the world' genre, allowing you to build anything your imagination allows you to. Combat system for stratagies. Tower defense. Exploration and minning (reminds me of Miner Miner). Instead of playing the whole game as you control the player, you are more the overlord telling your minions what you want done and when.\n\nI was dissapointed by the fact this game feels very much like any game you play on a smartphone or tablet (pretty sure it was designed for tablets). It takes too much to click and access certain items. I really think the crafting system needs an overhaul just to be easier to use. If not an overhaul maybe: 'one-click reciepes' instead of constantly having to add the items to the reciepe box. 'Auto craft' items like food, where the dwarfs will automatically craft food and/or fill the table.\n\nI would love to see more customizablity to the game, such as making your own dwarves. Assigning jobs or duties. Being able to sell stuff to the shop. I would also love to see more item options in the crafting menu and tech tree!! What this game REALLY needs is more tower defense items to help against the attacking hordes.

Digging one tile lower and suggenly you have no more resource (as wood or grown food) to replenish. E.g. different earth color placed by player could indicate that.\n- Grow rate is broken and annoying: tree may keep instantly grow at place where previous one was chopped, preventing that peace from digging, there must be a delay at given tile after removing resource from it, will it be a tree, bush, mushroom, crystal, etc.\n- Teleport spell should cost 1 mana and last longer, this is the only right way in the game to travel. On large map it become very annoying to move dwarves back/forth (it take too long to travel), elevator is bugged, train is not reliable and required investments (inculuding time), which not worth it.\n- Even after finishing game I have NO CLUE how many resources can one dwarf pick up or what 100 archery does. Tooltip and ingame help is way too casual.\n- Balance issue (archery is the only way to go, melee makes health management more intense, while magic is simply not reliable), swarms of enemies required escaping until tesla tech, then BAM, they are not a problem anymore at all suddenly and further gameplay become less intense (and more boring).\n\nPros:\n- It's simply beauteful game with variaty of activities.\n- Company, while consists from only 4 maps is in fact quite a long journey: every map is different, brings something new and each map took for me 30+ hours (!) to finish.","August 15, 2015","true","199.8"," 68 of 100 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","68","100","7","4"

It can be best described as Terraria if it were an RTS where you were in charge of a tribe of dwarves instead of just your hero and, of course, there was significantly less content to discover.\n\nYour tasks in the game include gathering resources, feeding and caring for your dwarves, researching technologies, building defensive structures, and digging deeper and deeper.  Each and every dwarf is an individual with skills that can be learned and improved and equipment that can be upgraded as you develop the technology and acquire the neccessary resources t ocraft it.  Though it was exciting to acquire new technology, it was often tedious working through the previous tech to fill your research bar as you are required to craft the same three or four items many, many times.\n\nThough it is enjoyable and I believe that it is worth it at a sale price under $10, the game does grow old rather quickly and, if you're anything like me, you'll find yourself burning out toward the end of the first of five worlds.

Made by a russian developer, this game doesn't fall short.\n\nPro:\n+ updates, Updates, UPDATES! This developer stands for early access, this game never laggs behind and delivers new content on a very common basis.\n+ Gameplay: this game is morelike, you give orders, and somedwarf will do it. If you dig for this "indirect commanding" this is your thing... if not... take controll of the dwarf and do it yourself.\n+ Progression: there are many things to achieve, enough to build and enough to kill.\n+ "Settler-effect": you can see those little dwarfs running around your monitor, and watch them doing the housework.\n\nNeutral:\n* Grafics: it's a matter of taste, if you love this tableski style of game, alright, if you want battlefield-4-grafic's engine... well, tough luck\n* Progression: You can't craft everything "right away" you need to, build enough of the previous items in the "itemlist"... it's not for everyone's taste.\n* Sound: also matter of taste, I switched off both right away (snoring dwarfs... snoring dwarfs everywhere)\n\nNegative:\n- routing and object-retrieving: it's still not very polished, right now. Still some issues with the "item-grabbing" from far away. You can't tell a dwarf to "pick something" up.... he has to do it himself.\n- no defined jobs: While now dwarfs have skills, it's still not save to give a attack order, and believing, just melee dwarfs (or archers), will get to it. No, gueriilia-style. You can loose your best miner/workshoper, when he fails to retrait.\n- skills are only gained, if they know the basics. They CAN use the item (cooking-base, while no cook is around), but won't gain any skills; while a cook would get some. New skills can only be unlocked with books. There are pretty rare.\n\n\nOverall: Solid game, worth the money and effort. If you are not sure, wait for the next sale to come up.

Its fantastic at what it does, and it gets regular touch ups to fix bugs (at this point). I've played since it was a much earlier beta, and I can safely say the game has definitely improved over time (except maybe the font, which used to be much simpler and more elegant).\n\nThe developers have also recently added multiplayer to the game, and I'm going to be blunt: its not great. Not to say its not fun, its more like its rather... unusual. Coop is fun especially if you get to spend it with friends. Versues is ... uh... rubbish? It would be fun if it wasn't so mind breakingly boring to watch I guess. Its odd, building up to fight is fun and strategic, actually fighting is a cross between trench warfare patience and looney toons violence. Its not ideal. PVP isn't really worth mentioning to be honest. I just pretend it doesn't exist.\n\nPersonally would rate 8/10. Its not action packed, but for a lazy building game its ideal. Great singleplayer game, passable multiplayer game (its about average, lets be fair). Would easily bump up with the inclusion of slightly more content (for example: pets/farm animals, real risk attacks, prayer system [to get additional mana, by sending dwarves to pray], higher difficulty, more items, etc.).\n\n------------------------\n\nEdit: Would honestly rate it closer to 7 out of 10 right now. As the game has developed theres been a few things which have stood out to me as existing problems. These are as follows:\n\n1) The largest flaw the tech tree. It is extremely grindy. You essentially are forced to produce garbage that you wouldn't want or need normally, and produce a lot of it. Should be an unlock system where you produce 2 or 3 of the items in that block and it unlocks the next tier.\n\nNow not to hammer this point home too hard, but this turns what otherwise would be a fantastic building and survival game into basically a furious grind at time. You grind for resources to proceed through the tech tree. You produce mountains of things you don't want or care about. That is the reality of the tech tree in Craft the World.\n\n2) Dwarf AI is better, but still leaves something to desire. This is sorta a nuetral point honestly, I dial up the speed to 2x so I don't have to deal with it normally, and when I do its easy to control one and do it myself. Recently, the focus has been to fix it, and its gotten much better.\n\n3) This might just be me, but the store really needs to be focused on more. Would be nice to have an ability to turn 10 mana into one gold just to get some money to replenish unobtainable materials. Lot of maps where I just simply ran out of coal for cooking or had to resort to waiting on minion waves to get money to buy basic metals because I couldn't find any. For example, the elevator requires a wheel, a bit of gold, and some other things I can't be bothered to remember. And its basically a must buy - no question about it. Building 10 of them though gets to be expensive on rare resources.","November 26, 2014","true","100.6"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","28","37","0","0"

The main problem is it's relatively slow-paced and all its flaws make it SLOWER.  If you like games like Banished, this might be up your alley.  If you're looking for something where you can get a fully functional base up and running in an hour or two, pass this one up.\n\nThe good:\n-The art style and graphics.  You can tell a lot of love and care went into making this both look and sound cute and pretty.\n-The overall idea.  It really does combine a lot of what made Dungeon Keeper and Terraria good.  A healthy amount of variety in what you can build and encounter, enough differences in the maps to make different environments stick out, etc.\n\nThe bad:\n-The AI... has character.  Dwarves are prone to hesitating, double-taking and getting confused on occasion.  It's not nearly bad enough to ruin a game but don't be surprised if one or two of them die simply because they backed into a corner, then just stood there taking a beating.\n-The dwarves have to actually pick up items and carry them back to your stockpile after harvesting, mining, etc.  They can only carry 3-5 at a time depending on how you equip them.  This isn't a big deal at the beginning of a level, but the further away they need to go the longer it takes.  They walk at a leisurely pace, and while there IS a teleport spell to make things easier, it isn't perfect, and it costs mana, which also regenerates slowly.\n-The difficulty curve.  It's a halfpipe.  The vast majority of the enemies, while plenty dangerous in the very beginning, can be dispatched by a determined horde with leather armor and maces with relative ease.  What passes for 'mid tier' enemies are generally only found in the most dangerous places on a map, and the one legit endgame monster species can send even the best-prepared army running for their beds, battered and bruised.\n\nThe downright ugly:\n-The tech tree.  In the campaign mode, you advance through the tiers and learn new recipes by crafting a set amount of components, tools, etc. in a particular category.  Sometimes it's intuitive, you need to forge iron weapons to get the knowhow for steel.  More often, and especially in the mid-late game, it's ridiculously arbitrary.  For instance, you'll have to make precious vases in order to make stone sculptures to build battlements to weave yarn to build couches to FINALLY get that shiny silver sword you've been eyeballing.  And all that decorative crap you just made?  Well, if you weren't planning on using any of it, you've just spent a ton of resources and hours of time making things that are just gonna sit in your stockpile.  Because of this, worlds that should realstically take 5 or 6 hours to complete take like 10.\n\nSo would I recommend it?  Well... yes, if you've a lot of free time on your hands and a lot of patience.  I got this half-off, and frankly 8 bucks, even for a deeply flawed gem, ain't bad.","November 23, 2014","true","104.3"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","0"

[Prior to 12/1/2013]\n0.9.007 Introduced key updates which show improvement and updates, including a sandbox mode.\n----\n\nWarning: The following was composed while the game was released in Alpha 0.1.0.\nIntroductionCraft The World, the beta has a great deal of potential; it highly depends how the development of the beta goes to see if I would recommend this game when its finished.\n\nThere are many features of this game which are interesting; it is just that the methodologies of the features are really monotonous.\n\nGraphicsYou’ll notice that most of the games graphics look highly polished in a nice 2Dish format.\n\nInterfaceThe interface is highly cumbersome, there is only one direct toolbar to utilize things, place things, and cast spells. Otherwise you are working with a really cumbersome menu system to either equip, craft things, view objectives. With all honestly at the current stages of development it feels like much more time was spent on giving it a glossy look rather then utility of the interface; like this game was made for a tablet, or a touch device. My opinion is it that is lacks greatly in the interface and should utilize an in-game expendable interface, expand the quick slots and expend the use of shortcut keys. This happens to be one of my current gripes with the game, same with the Dwarves AI, Crafting and Materials.\n\nSounds / MusicSound can start to be annoying after a while, which is fine. Music has a problem where it just stops playing until you either exit and resume the game or exit completely and start it again.\n\nCraftingAdvancing you have to follow these blueprint tree layouts, which means you have to build useless things a good amount of the time to advance. Within this case it would benefited from a type of freeform of crafting or trees which actually make sense. One of the examples of this is, early game you can gain access to materials for better weapons and armor. However you are unable to actually build them until you craft the other things to build them; which are completely unrelated.\n\nIt should be noted that many resources are highly used however are rare or hard to get too. Which makes the early stages of the game completely unbalanced, which will be noted below.\n\nDwarvesGenerally the Dwarves have their own ideas about things, this concept is generally alright; worst part is the AIs decision making process; it is extremely hard to affect until later in the game. Currently the AI likes to run off and basically die on whims, until you are able to advance up the crafting tree; however that make take 30+ minutes to actually have the Dwarves somewhat manageable.\n\nThe first 30 minutes or more of the game you should expect to lose Dwarves a good amount since you will not be able to properly equip them, or deal with the feeding system. Path finding for the Dwarves can be problematic also; the portal spell they tend to ignore. You are also able to take control of a dwarf however that does not do you much good and the interface seems to be rather ‘make shift’, at an attempt to fix their path finding from being broken.\n\nAlso feeding them, you’ll find the AI will refuse to eat the same things over again; this becomes a problem since you have limited resources and must advance up the crafting tree.\n\nHousingThe housing system is interesting with the comfort concept, however it is far to easy to create problems with it, or the totems all and all stop function until the game is restarted. For the most part of the game, you will just have a wood house and walls since you have to horde materials to move up the crafting system to actually build anything good, or make it so your dwarves do not up and die. So currently do not expect your house to be really grand until you wasted a good amount of time hording materials. Housing and comfort items needs to be in their own tree of advancement\n\nMonstersThe monsters are alright, late game they still cause problems due to general AI decision failures. There is also the problem they can become overwhelmed easily. Monster waves are currently broken to the point that you can make it so your house is level with the rest of the ground with two doors and build everything downwards or upwards. By doing this the wave will either come from the left or right and you can position all your dwarves inside with bows and just fire from the inside. This will disrupt the mob from breaking the door and killing them over time.\n\nSpellsThe spells need to be in their own tree and should be completely revamped. It takes far too much time to actually make them useful, beyond the portal spell. The light spell is useless early game until you start abusing it to find materials underground. The growth spell is useless; you can just basically craft a line of flat dirt and have better results and not waste mana. Fireball is received to late in the game due to the crafting system.\n\nConclusionHopefully while the game progresses things change before the end of beta.\n\nWork HistoryUpdated: Dec 09, 2015 @2:58pm\nFormatting\nAdded Work History.\nNone of the complied review text was changed.","November 28, 2013","true","27.2"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","2"

So.\n\nThis is:\nTerraria + Dungeon Keeper + Delve Deeper/Dwarfs?! + obviously everyone's favorite Dwarf Fortress all combined in a pretty package, with a CiV-esque tech tree, Minecraft-ish crafting system and a bit of Tower Defense.\n\nWhat you get is the campaign and sandbox modes with adjustable difficulty settings (that includes permadeath and various world types/sizes), so there's a good amount of replayability and whatnot even after you beat the campaign. Fun fun. No story though, but who needs a story in these types of games, right? Go whack a tree. Beat some chickens down with a large stick. Pick up all sorts of useless ♥♥♥♥.

Well, let's take a look at.\n\nFirst of all I must point out, that while this game is quite interesting — I had a difficult decision on whether It should be recommend or not. There are good sides to it - it's quite fun, that good ol' fun.\nNot ever since minecraft had digging into the mother Earth's crust to be such a delightful way to spend some time over a game. It's just like terraria, except that instead of one goof you control a whole bunch of em! And they don't cope with you well! Think of dwarf fortress, indeed like the game states, but increase the IQ of your minions by two handfuls of fairy dust, add a splash of hair balm and there you have it - Dwarf Terrarius! If you're a fan of such games — you should give this one a try.\nNext stop on our list is — the way you command. Just with one push of a button you send out your minions to chop, dig, fish and slaughter in your Godly appendage! Yeah, there isn't much complexity into it, as far as I got - one click and there ya go, no Blaze blue combo memory required.\nStep number three — crafting! The tech tree is quite big. It contain plenty of stuff that will help you turn your dwarfs into raging digging machines filled with roasted fish, salads and beer.\n\nBut like the good sides of this game there are a few bad ones, especially for me, which later from just bad turned out to be extremely frustrated.\n\nThe tech tree. Yes! I know, I just said that crafting was a good thing. B---u---t.... it also makes it a bad one. From the start you can see the whole tech tree, so you won't get any surprises at all. You can take a peek at what goodies you'll be getting in the end. Not to mention that a lot of tech is just an upgrade of previously used one, as with weapons, cooking or furniture - it just gets improved a bit.  Oh, and to finish the game you pretty much just need to develop all the tech tree to the end. And each time it's just the same - chop, build easy sheit and then build enough of it to get tech to make improved sheit. After one level you can pretty much turn the table and say - I beat Craft the World. Go take a sip of champagne, slice the celebration cake - you are the winner! «Can't you beat the game without improving all the tech to max?» - you'll say? No. No you cannot do that. The problem is that at the end you need mithril bars to make parts of the gate to go to another level. Not to mention that the recopies for those are dropped from an extremely deadly mob that, frankly, goes down fast if you use mithril weapons on him. But they are way back at the end of tech tree.\n\nDeveloping the tech tree is frustrating as well, especially on the first level. The amounts of recourses you're needed to build up the tech tree is just azz. Not sure how others play, but I found myself lacking those a lot. I just had to dig over almost the entire map to get enough to acquire some mithril and then just send out my dwarfs to murder and get murdered by the guardians of the gate recopies. That's how frustrated I was, just rushing, to finish that 12,5 hour long game which was going out at 2x speed most of the time. And I don't have anything about long games. But this game isn't long, it just psz you off by making you have to dig all the map over, chop/rechop thousands of trees to get the tech levels up and gear.\nAnd it's not necessary. Not at all. I'm not even kidding, there actually isn't much of "world crafting". Not at all. The first level in all its "glory" will be your bane. You can't send out dwarfs to "chop trees", you need to click every single tree (or right-click swipe em) to get those lumbers down. Then you wait for those to grow back or use magic to grow some at an instant. And then you can sit back to recover your mana for a couple of real life hours.\nYou can't just build fun stuff, you need to develop tech, and you develop it by making useless, not needed, simply wasted items you'll barely use.  At the end my stockpile was filled with loads and loads of sheit like traps, cages, etc... which consumed a ton of resources and didn't do much favor in return, other than increasing the tech-o-meter.\n\nThe lack of resources is another thing — there are certain resources that are limited on the first level that much, that it will make you pull your hair out of your nostrils due to that. Especially iron and coal... oh God... and trees.... It will make you rage. Oh, and those recourses are required by a lot. A lot of tech uses it and as we all know - you can't win without tech!\n\nIn the end I decided on placing a "don't recommend" on it. The game is hard, but it's that very bad type of hard here. It's not difficult, but it turns the game into a routine. You just do sheit over and over most of the time, thus increasing your playtime by a whole god damn much. And it's not fun. DF was fun, because loosing was fun! In here you just don't get much fun. The game is a jack of all trades but a master of none, it took juicy parts of cult games, mixed it up with their creativity and in the end that sweet, sweet cocktail, that should go layered is just mixed up into brownish liquid. Cheers!\n\nSO currently it's not worth it to get the game, maybe later it will work out but now- go download DF and lose fun!\n","November 29, 2014","false","19.9"," 68 of 116 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","68","116","0","3"

Well, most of my complaints are similar to others who've reviewed the game, but i'll enumerate them all the same.\n\nFirstly, i found the UI to be either merely acceptable at best and cumbersome at worst on the PC. Why make me click and drag to craft things for the first time? It feels like an attempt to copy similar mechanics from similar games, but here it feels much more forced.\n\nSecondly, controlling the dwarves is extremely frustrating, as there is no way to assign particular dwarves to particular tasks or particular types of work. Designate an area to get tunneled out and it's anyone's guess which dwarf will actually get started on it. Have an enemy at the door no one's paying attention to? Well, you could click on it to tell your dwarves to attack it, but then everyone nearby will drop whatever they're doing (or carrying) and run over to attack it.\n\nLastly, the portals feel like a failed attempt at applying some pressure to the player. In the beginning they're not bad and maybe even a bit fun in that i get to watch my dwarves beat up some undead, but eventually they're simply something that i have to sit through for several minutes so that i can get back to business.\n\nSo why have i played it so much? Because i bought it and sometimes it almost scratches a particular itch i have. That and my kids enjoy it.\n\nBut, overall, whenever i play it i just wish it were better.","March 5","false","160.0"," 30 of 47 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","30","47","0","0"

In it, you play a clan of Dwarves who must brave the elements and the local hostile fauna to find the Great Portal and escape... to a bigger, scarier planet where you do it all again...\n\nThis is a 2D side-scroller like Terraria. Unlike Terraria, the graphics are designed to be slick and gorgeous, rather than deliberately retro. Your characters are adorbable, grumpy little Dwarves, each with a special name, look, outfit and job. You can have cooks, miners, climbers, swimmers, fishers, mages, lumberjacks, etc. They go about the world collecting resources so you can help them build their fortress/castle/home in the manner you see fit. And yes, you really "Craft the World." Crafting is the major goal of this game. You can play in craft-tree mode, adventure mode or sandbox mode, learning each new crafting recipe and building your repetoire of wonderous items you can make, from armor and weapons, decorative building blocks, furniture, foods, potions all the way up to a Tesla device to help fight off hordes of rampaging skeletons (or mummies, or yetis... or goblins...)\n\nYou can equip each Dwarf with items you have them craft, bettering their skills for their jobs, and protecting them from baddies. You can also take control of an individual Dwarf to speed up the building process if you like. There are also several magic spells you can use to help out your merry band of Dwarves, such as magic portals, fireballs, magic imps who will help them carry resources back to the stockpile, and more. The maps range from small/med/large (sort of like Terraria.)\n\nThe first time I played the game I said to myself "this is only in BETA?" It looked finished to me. Then Dekovir, the creators, kept on adding new content... tweaking AIs, finding and fixing glitches... It's a blast, and I highly recommend it.","November 21, 2014","true","51.2"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

Its full of crafting, macro- and micro-management, lovely, survival and progression. At first, the game had some serious issues. Or lets say, the AI had its issues. But its constantly updated and you will feel that it gets better with every update.\n\nThe visuals look alot like any BigFishGames game. Its plain, but lovely.\n\nThe gameplay itself can be pretty addicting. Many people are annoyed by the techtree progression system, but if you do not like to use it, you can just play the game in sandbox mode. It will replace the techtree with recipes that you will find throughout the game. If you do not like this either, just open the wiki website, pretty much like in minecraft, and craft anything you want.\nA pretty neat feature is that you can either give commands to your dwarfs or take over any of them and do the work yourself. That can be really helpful when it comes to crafting complicated structures. Or just sit back, relax and let the dwarfs do all the work.\n\nThe AI, as mentioned, sometimes struggles from pathfinding problems and such. But there are many ways to get around those problems.\n(Sidenote: I constantly killed giants in Skyrim by simply running around an obstacle and shooting lightings at them while they were too dumb to figure out how to get to me.) There is NO perfect AI in any game. But at least the devs in CTW always try to improve your precious minions.\n\nA few weeks ago, they launched the multiplayer mode. Right now, you have to unlock this mode. You need a certain amount of dwarfs, but thats not bad. It just means, you have to advance a little in singleplayer and than can join multiplayer matches. There are pvp or coop matches. You will join a new biome and have to beat the main boss. But first, you have to dig, collect and craft. Its really nice and the unique rewards will help you improve your main biome. The only sad thing about the multiplayer is that there is no way to start right off with a friend and play on the same map ... yet.\n\nI was truly amused when I first found a Jason mask that can be worn by the dwarfs. So, its clearly visible that the devs keep adding fresh content. For an early access game, it is very stable!\n\nIf you're into management, crafting without being the active part in the game, you should give it a try. And hey: There are no freaking micro-transactions in this game. Only micro-management.","January 2","true","84.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Nearly everything is done through indirect control. You mark where to dig, and where to place items, tell them what to craft, who to attack - as of now (I should state I'm writing this while the game is still in early access/beta. So things are still being added and tweaked and balanced and etc) there are a few things you are more actively doing - during bigger fights if your dwarves health gets low they'll run away, at a point you'll be able to tell them to craft health potions. Right now, it seems the only way to use them is by you using them on the appropriate dwarf when their health is getting low. You also have a few items you can place and remove without the dwarves doing it for you - the main item that you'll be using in this manner is scaffolding that you can place to help the dwarves climb up something that would be hard to climb on their own and you only need a temporary item for them to use to climb. Portable ladders...)\nEr, anyway, the description of the game says it's inspired by Dungeon Keeper, Dwarf Fortress, and Terraria. I can see the Terraria inspiration, but the gameplay is not like Terraria at all. I'm pointing that out because Ive seen some comments on this  game lamenting (whining) about another Terraria clone and the ways that Terraria was an inspiration to the developers of this game are not ways that led to a clone. I would say the graphic style and some of the mechanics for what defines a home are the big things that seem Terraria inspired.\n\nAnyway, it's really fun and I can't wait to see what each update will bring! So if you like buildy, crafty, strategy, dwarfy, explory, games then I totally recommend this game. And I would even recommend it in general since it feels like it's a game that is not so heavy (*cough Dwarf Fortress cough*) that you have to be hardcore about the style of game to get into it.\nIn short, RECOMMENDED. *imagine a loud kind of stamp hitting a document sound...like ...

There is no content here past "leveling up" and that feels like a hollow and pointless experience.\n\nProbably the worst part of this whole game is the "Tech Tree" which seems like it would be a feature.

Stupidity, check. Deaths and hilarity, check. Nice graphics.. wait what?\nCraft the World is for want of a better term "My first Dwarf Fortress". It's Dwarf Fortress made accessible to the market, and it's about time someone actually got around to -doing- this. Initially released in Early Access, this title has been something of a rough gem that has, over time steadily been sanded and milled into a shining diamond, just waiting to be plucked from the dark underdepths by grubby, stubby hands and long, curly beards.\n\nAll of the dwarves, none of the terrifying ASCII\nDwarf Fortress is a very "marmite" game, because in part it's one of those games that requires the kind of in depth understanding of all the systems and sub-systems that go into it that usually come along with multi year degree courses. Not so in Craft the World, no, whilst the Dwarves do exhibit elemental stupidity in buckets, much like their DF cousins, they are quite able to follow simple instructions and they are able to manage their tasks in a vaguely dwarfish manner. Those skilled in their jobs will prioritise things accordingly, and the dwarves with weapons will actually kill things, as opposed to stabbing themselves in the foot. There's none of this "Fey mood" malarky either, thank dieties. Instead you'll be dealing with nightfall bringing undead knocking at your door and ghosts who wreak havoc with your stockpiles.\n\nA rich and engaging system that will have you whittling away for hours\nWhilst the tech tree was "servicable" to begin with, now it's a monolithic thing that requires time and effort to unpick, with dwarves being forced to live in fairly basic digs with leafy beds before they are given homes suited to their dwarfly status. The game systems now support farming, fishing, and a full complement of other activities, so provided you can keep your dwarves alive, you can eventually have a busy, thriving little fortress, able to stand up to the worst that the world throws at you. Well, most of the time...\n\nThrow in trading with the locals when you acquire precious gold coins, skill books which teach your dwarves such vital skills such as how to climb without plummeting to their doom and a simple RPG-lite system of skill building and you've a recipe for quite entertaining gameplay. It may not have the absolute depth of Dwarf Fortress, but it certainly will slake the thirst of anyone wanting to get -into- the DF genre, and in that, it serves as an excellent introduction.\n\nDawwwwh, they're so cute...\nThe graphical style is well thought out, opting for a very cartoonish and well furnished design that uses sweeping colourful flourishes and a wide palette, ensuring that there's always something interesting going on, and that the dwarven holdings -look- the part. Furniture goes from being something that shames you to being something that shines. Enemies range from comical looking skeletons to nasty beholders and trolls and goblins, all well thought out and whilst not perhaps going to win awards for animation, they -do- look well designed and everything in the world is consistent.\n\nThe sound? Well. I'll be diplomatic. If I hear dwarves snoring one more time... *eyetwitch*\n\nClosing thoughts.\nIt's "My First Dwarf Fortress", and it's a very good place to start, there's been other efforts, and those have done pretty badly in comparison, this one however nails the mark, striking a good balance between being accessible to the newcomer yet offering enough of a challenge to keep experienced players at the whetstone long enough that they should feel suitably stretched out enough to consider graduating to the 'real' Dwarf Fortress, if that so pleases them.\n\nVerdict : Recommended - Especially to fans of Dwarf Fortress, or to people looking to get into the DF genre.\n\nWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

Some people on the forums have complianed about bugs, crashes, not beenable to start it. but sense ive owned this game(i bought it last march) i havent had any crashes or bugs. the only problem i have had, is that the dwarves dont always take the best route. but i think it is TOTALLY worth the &15 there asking right now\n9.5/10 very addicting and different than most games out there","September 29, 2014","true","51.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Some bits of the tech tree are not terribly intuitive (why do I need to learn weaving before I can make steel armor?) but my guess is they're laid out where they are so that you can't just ignore half the tree until you've built a complete powerhouse dwarf crew who are threatened by nothing, and then finish everything else at your leisure. The rain mechanic is really nicely executed, though you can accidentally drown your entire sheep farm if you lay things out wrong, and the difficulty of the monster waves ramps up at a pretty good pace.\n\nIt made my old computer (a 2009 MacBook) crash occasionally if I was trying to run other programs simultaneously, but that was definitely a function of hitting obsolete hardware limits. Bought computer made in this decade, no longer have crash issues.\n\n48 hours in this game in the last two weeks and I'm jonesing for more. I really like that the campaign mode gives you a series of goals to accomplish (and then re-accomplish in the next world), because completely sandbox games tend to lose me after a while. I get a base built and stable and equip my guys and... then what? Well, start over, I guess. Campaign mode makes starting over into progress. The resource limitations in the ice world are a pain in the ♥♥♥, but it's livable and gives you all the more motivation to get the portal rebuilt and get the hell out of there.\n\nThe thing I'd most like to see in future releases is the ability to set standing orders so my dwarves have tasks they will return to any time a condition is (not) met: when food in inventory drops below 10, grill meat. When wool in inventory drops below 5, shear sheep/llama. Lower on my priority list but also good would be an option between the current "stay in the shelter" and "go wherever" modes for the dwarves' movement range -- either a defined distance they could forage outside or a set of markers you could place to limit how far they explore, so you don't have lone dwarves trudging off to the end of the map and getting lost because there's a ball of dirt to pick up somewhere.\n\nGood stuff, though.

I played this alot and i never get tired of playing it. But everything cannot be perfect... I´ve found to flaws with the game this far. The thing is the AI is not always as you would like it be (it´s a bit stupid) and becouse of that the second flaw comes, the dwarwes die easily of enviromental things when there are other ways...  So lets think that youre favorite dwarf goes to colloct some stone you found in some tunnel you dug. and then u put up a portal and what do he do? He travels over the water instead and drown, so then the resources and next dwarf comes and get it and you have to stop it and use the imp spell or the collect spell that transport the items to your stockpile and you loose a dwarf for nothing. How will you get a new dwarf like that? You wonder later, and the thing is you have to wait until a dwarf with the right skill comes and then you need two new books to give the dwarf the skills you wanted it to have. But that can take a long time. So becouse of the not so smart AI it comes a second flaw. You cannot replace skills.

This game tackles many different ideas at once to great effect. It's got the 2D sidescrolling world of Terraria, above ground and below ground, but not as vast in size. It's got the god-game system of Dungeon Keeper, in which you can give orders to your dwarves and have them go about the business of accomplishing it (or take direct control of one of them specifically, also like Dungeon Keeper). And you've got the fortress building aspect of...well...Dwarf Fortress. This is one of those interesting games where starting out can be brutal, especially for a new player, but gets easier as you go, as opposed to other games that start small and scale in difficulty. But that's really one of its strong points, as it has you learning on your toes and makes you think about your next move and how you spend your resources. But that doesn't mean it'll let you off easy, even after you've learned the ropes.\n\nLike most sandbox games, CtW gives you time to build up, and time to be wary. Daytime offers a peaceful chance to work and get things done, while night brings the potential of undead raids on your treasured home. Every 50 minutes of real time play, a portal raid will begin to truly test whether you've prepared properly, or not. And they keep getting harder as well, to force you to think faster and beat the level to ultimately survive.\n\nThe crafting is smooth and easy to manage, the graphics are bright and colorful (never really feeling dull thankfully), and the fighting system isn't complicated while still offering plenty of room for strategy to aid the dwarves. Seriously, you'll think of plenty of tricks and traps to make the deadly portal raids easier as you go along, and coming up with said strategies is a large part of the fun.\n\nYou'll see some people complain no doubt about resource shortages in the late game, but resource management is important, and it isn't a game problem, it's the players fault for wasting items. This isn't just a sandbox game. It's a multitude of genres at once. It's a sandbox-fort building-management-strategy-survival game with three worlds each between 20-40 hours a piece. It's not about making a beautiful world like Minecraft or Terraria (though you'll love building your fort/home) it's about the brutal survival of moving your dwarves to the next world, towards (what they hope) will be their new home in escaping an undead menace.\n\n10/10 Easily one of the top games of 2014. You'll start playing and look to realize in horror that you've played for hours on end and it's time to sleep. But you won't sleep.","November 25, 2014","true","158.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

While there is currently only one level available, with some minor glitches, it is definetely release quality.\n\nBeyond just the state of the game, it is pretty addictive. I played until 1 am last night and didn't even realize it was so late. I've played about 13 hours and I'm only about 2/3 done with the tech tree.  The leveling/task system does a good job of guiding you through the tech progression and guiding you on what you should accomplish as far as base building.\n\nI'll admit that it did take me a little while to figue out some of the basics. I didn't know that after you placed a backround block of dirt/wood that placing a second one will build a solid wall. I didn't realize right away that when one of my dwarves die, they respawn. Also, I didn't realize that the "2" next to the Portal spell ment that it cost 2 Mana not that I only had 2 uses. Admitting this does make me feel like kind of a noob but considering that these weren't readily apparent to someone who has played similar games, such as Terraria, to completion, it would be helpful to have a better indication of this.(Maybe tasks that make you do these things)\n\nThe AI could use some improvement, the Dwarfs won't automatically use their highest skills when you queue a task, but over the game is well worth its current price and is a lot of fun.

Instead of being the lone adventurer out to build a massive sprawling castle or making pretty blocky statues and such, you're the overseer of a group of dwarves. You select where to mine, chop, fight or build and they do their best to fulfill the orders while acting autonomously.\n\nMany games let you whip together every item as long as you've memorized the recipe. In this, we see items gatewayed behind a Tech Tree, which requires you to build and equip/use/place each type of item to unlock the next items. The game also presents you with a series of Tasks, mostly boiling down to advancing the Tech Tree, but it helps guide your building and exploring instead of endlessly digging through random terrain. You always have at least one goal to work towards.\n\nYour Dwarves will require food and shelter and protection, as the denizens of this world will actively seek to plunder your resources. Build your defenses well and craft new weapons and armour to keep it safe. Each Dwarf can learn up to three skills which help them in combat, crafting or movement; a new Dwarf starts with one random skill, and the second two can be added by you with Skill Books which are found throughout the world.\n\nWhile Craft the World may look like Terraria, it's closer to a 2D Towns or Dwarf Fortress or Dungeon Keeper. For an Early Access game, it's feeling very much like it's close to launch-ready. I'm sure there are more features to add in and refinements and optimizations to go, don't get me wrong, I just mean that it's a very well-done beta; it feels like a full game instead of a skeleton with promise.\n\nThe initial learning curve is fairly easy as long as you stay focused on building a proper shelter (I recommend underground) ASAP.

If one of my dwarves die, like the one stated above, I didn't feel much 'sadness', just another dwarf that was suicidal. i just wish that each dwarf is more unique to the others, and when he gains skill level he gets power ups or miscelleanious changes, so that he is different to the lot. I enjoy the game but it sometimes becomes boring due to the tech tree which is a forced manufacture of items you will never use and are expensive to make in order to reach the things you acually want, this concept is in its primary stages and has the potential of improving the game, but at it's current state, the tech tree is more like a forced line of actions, not a choice based decision.\n\nSo please devs, improve the A.I., make each dwarf more unique and special to the player, and make a better tech tree.","December 28, 2015","true","13.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","4","4","5","0"

It has great art direction, sound, challenge, options, etc.   It is my favorite city builder/simulation style game from a 2D side view perspective.    I actually like the this more than Terraria, Starbound, etc.   However, this is a different type of game.  In those games you control a person.   In this one you designate things you want people to do.  This is like a side view Dwarf Fortress and it is very well made.    It is still early access.   I played it a lot months ago then stopped playing it for awhile.   I revisited it yesterday and have noticed a lot of changes and improvements.\n\n\nMY FIRST REVIEW OF THIS:\nSo far I haven't gone far enough into this game to have an opinion on the difficulty curve, and I am writing this review when it is still in early access.   This addressed the aspect of the Terraria style game that did not appeal to me as much.   This game does not have you as an individual but, rather you designate tasks for dwarves that you accumulate over time so it is a lot like a side scrolling Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria.   This is very appealing.   Throw on top of that a superb art direction and I think we have a keeper of a game here.  Well done!   This has the best art style of any game in this genre so far in my opinion.   It is great for the base building fans, survival fans, etc.    It is still early access... I am excited to see where they take this.   I also have only played 99 minutes at the time of writing this, but I very much have enjoyed the time I have spent.","December 21, 2013","true","172.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","3"

It's like terraria with minions that do the work unless you take control of them.\n\nThe building aspect is a lacking and doesnt interact with neighboring blocks really well. For example all the brick blocks have only one texture so they look like checker board when you lay them down like the brick wall. One item takes at least a whole block. If you place a wall block, its limited to what form it can take which could lead to some walls looking sawed off instead of aesthetically pleasing. Theres other pet-peeves here and there.\n\nThe game currently doesn't feel like they have an end game content since there's no plot, missions, many point of interest or crafting/building is still limited. However in the time I did spend with it, I did enjoy. I'm expecting the devs have a lot of great plans for this game.\n\nIt's irresponsible for any reviewer to bash this game saying its a Terraria or Minecraft copy. It has some similar traits but the play style and visuals are different. We can say all the platformers are copying Mario or the puzzle games copying Tetris.\n\n\n-= Suggestions for Devs (since I'm lazy to post in their forums) =-\n\n- Simplify the crafting. It can get tidious with the whole drag and drop thing.\n\n- More variety of items, building synergy and textures\n\n- A sense of direction. I feel like I'm just trying to grind my way up the tech tree because i dont want to waste my limited mats on stuff that'll be replaced quickly in the future.\n\n- Giving quests, main story and the like gives players a stronger sense of purpose along with/or besides the I just want to build s**t.\n\n- Defeat epic enemies to unlock powerful spells, uncraftable items, building technique or technologies? No different than the tech tree style.\n\n- They can choose to partake in these quests/story or just explore and build stuff. For the uncraftable stuff. It could be randomly crafted through a machine or craftable in sandbox mode or something.\n\nThere's more to recommend but these are good starters.\n\n\nIt might seem like a negative review but I actually recommend people to give this a try.

Rex Power Colt","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006058575/","174 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game has serious potential to be a great game, however, there are several game mechanics that are handled in the wrong way.\n\nFirstly, the tech tree. Whilst a great idea, it forces you to build pointless items for which you have no use for, in order to unlock some of the more basic requirements in the early game. In my personal opinion, it would have been better to have several seperate tech trees to allow you to work towards the things you need. For example: A tech tree for weapons, armour, tools, furniture etc.\n\nSecondly, you can't control groups of dwarves. You can either select one dwarf and control him manually (or give him an order to sleep/ eat), or select all dwarves to do one task. I was hoping that I would be able to select a few dwarves to cut down trees, some to mine, some to fight etc. You also cannot select a few dwarves and tell them where to move to, unless you are controlling each one individually, or giving them a task to do (e.g Mine that block). This becomes particularly annoying when you are being attacked by monsters in the early game. Your dwarves will just run in and die fighting and there is nothing you can do to stop them unless you purposefully trap them underground before the attacks.\n\nLastly, with all these things in mind, you are attacked by monsters every night. Whilst not as devestating as one of the full waves of monsters that occurs every 45 minutes or so (If I remember the time correctly), there is the occasional monster that is just too strong for your 2-3 dwarves that you would have by that point. Having not being able to unlock some of the better weapons/ armour (because you essentially have to learn how to make a salad before you can construct a furnace, to make steel) and with your dwarves charging in carelessly, you will find yourself losing all your dwarves within the first 20 minutes of the game. That aside, if you lose all dwarves, one will respawn at your stockpile around 2 minutes after everyone else was wiped out.\n\nProblems aside, this game looks fantastic, especially for an Early Access game. If you like Terraria, this game is a good choice for you. Just take into account the things I have mentioned before buying. Whilst slightly disappointed, I can see the potential, I will wait before uninstalling it, hoping that some changes will be made for the final release.","November 30, 2013","true","6.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The art is good, the music is great, the theme and overall gameplay is pretty good.\n\nHowever, you progress through the game by either chewing through the entire tech tree (Dozens of hours worth of work), or by taking out two preposterously tough creatures which require mid-grade gear to have a prayer, and high end gear to reasonably take on.\n\nOnce you beat a level, you get to move on to a different biome theme and grind the same tech tree over again until you either research everything or take out a couple preposterously difficult monsters.\n\nOn top of this, the "quests" really don't give an indication of the end game, just that you need to build seventeen flower pots to level up so you can learn the next weapon crafting so you can learn farming.\n\nIf they revisited victory conditions, and the tech trees, this would be a really pretty cool game.\n\nAs an example: Forest Biome - Accomplish 3 of the following (Create a lake of X size, Harvest a bajillion wood, Build a keep of X size, Kill supertough badguy, Complete the tech tree, etc). For the tech trees, if they split them out into Military, Resource, and Keep trees with specific recipes requiring levels from other trees (such as traps being in the keep tree, but not being available without iron weapons) it would go miles, as currently it seems like the progression is driven by a pattern rather than a logical progression.\n\nThere is a lot of good in this game, but progression is stymied by the victory conditions literally being "grind tech for ten hours to get to the next level to grind tech for ten more hours".

However, Craft the World expertly mixes multiple genres into something interesting to play. While only in 'early access' at this time, it already has more than enough to count as a 'completed game'. It is a nice alternative to more intense games (Dwarf Fortress), that is easier to pick up and play- or return to, after a break. Short bursts are better managed by the slightly more casual style, and the 'tower defence' aspect is well implimented.\n\nAs an individual who is rather picky about games, and who doesn't often (ever, really) write recommendations, the very fact I am should speak volumes on this game.\n\nWhile Craft the World is not perfect- and could use some better pacing in areas, possibly a refinement to the crafting tree at times- it is better than anything I've played in a while.

And I am also too impatient to wait for the game to finish before playing it, so I always end up with a bad experience of the game.\n\nAfter seeing a video of the gameplay for Craft the World, I fell in love with the simple design, yet rather good looking. I have to admit that this is no AAA game with perfect graphics like Crysis, but it is not anything like many of the Indie games you find on greenlight. The artwork is good looking, and the animations are just good.\n\nSo, what works?\nPretty much everything. Although there is currently only 2 levels out of what seems to be 5 when released, each level still offers about 10 hours of gameplay before finished. This does not include the "endless game" option you also have, which could have as much as 50 hours of gameplay. Each level can also be continued, as you don't have to go through the portal into the next level until you want to. Nice touch.\nI'd like to state that this game has a few bugs still, but the devs have been very good at fixing these. I saw 3 patches just before christmas, a week apart, fixing pretty much everything I had to complain about.\n\nSo, what doesn't work?\nWell, the pathing of the dwarves (your minions) is sometimes strange. The UI cannot recognize a ladder, and when you take control of the dwarves it gets worse. If he is climbing while you possess him, he will fall down the ladder. Apparently dwarves cannot multitask.\nAlso sometimes when you have possession of a dwarf he will not use the ladder but tries to scale the cliffs himself, but the code does not allow this as there is a ladder. So there are a few annoying bugs, but most can be solved simply by stop possessing him for a second, before regaining control. Annoying, but something that is being worked on right now (read more on the forum for known bugs).\n\nConclusion:\nI have seen many released games with more bugs (X-rebirth anyone?), even big AAA titles (Yes Rome2, I'm looking at you!). Had this game contained all 5 levels (As it seems they want to include in the final game - I still hope for more levels as DLC), I would not feel this was a bad purchase for 12-15€ or whatever I paid for the game in its current state.\nWith the developers being very good at maintaining a frequent patching frequenzy I am sure this game will soon be without bugs. Then this game is an absolutely must buy!\n\nFinal verdict:\nGraphics: 7/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nReplayability: 8/10\nValue for money: 10/10\nroughly 10 hours gameplay pr. level time 5 levels = 50 hours of fun gameplay. Add another 50 if you want the endless sandbox mode and want to obtain everything.\nSo 100 hours of gameplay for 1/3 the price of an AAA title? This is a must buy title!!!\nOh yeah, and when the Dwarves charge to battle, they scream something incoherent that sounds like "On to da turd". For that laugh alone the game is worth it's pricetag.","January 15, 2014","true","216.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have restarted this game who knows how many times and each game play just makes it that much more fun.  The developers are constantly updating so no fear that you are buying into a "dead" game.\n\nAs for the game itself it is a sandbox styled game that is reminiscent of Minecraft. (Hate to compare games, but when the shoe fits...) Instead of having one person however you have a team dwarves that go around and complete your assigned task.  I will note that this does not seem to be a perfect setup as several times I have had major needs unfulfilled and yet my team is off digging randomly.\n\nIn short, great game, few bugs in my opinion really worth giving a go.\n\nThanks!","August 29, 2014","true","68.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I found myself watching my dwarves going about their business and sometimes getting frustrated about their pathing and who does what. Even attempting to manually control them via giving them commands to Eat or Sleep can be weird, sometimes I found myself having to give them the command more than once before they'd actually go and do it. Taking direct control is also clunky and usually not even worth it. Even with their AI and pathing problems it's just easier to let them figure it out themselves than to take control and immediately feel confused about how to do anything and be slower about it. They also aren't 'smart' enough with some commands, like digging.. if you want them to dig in an area you have to be ready to babysit them a bit, because if you mark a bunch of stuff at once the game will sometimes cancel all the options because the blocks behind the first block are not 'reachable'.\n\nStill... I did enjoy this game. I would honestly have more hours on it if I didn't keep myself from playing it, because once I start I keep on playing until the afternoon of the following day and I regret it.

Your only hindrance being native goblins, ant nests, and rampant undead trying to make your day worse. The gameplay is rather casual, and involves a lot of waiting, but the presentation is fun, and you end up staring at what your dwarves are doing as they go around their menial labour that you've set out for them. The biggest challenge seems to be the first few days in the game, after which you have probably, and hopefully, unlocked more dwarves, and cleared most of what the game has to offer. Rest is just going down the technology tree towards the final unlockables, which by estimation takes around 10 hours of gameplay, after which you have the chance to start again on a slightly larger map with a little bit more challenge.\n\nSadly, the game gives all the crafting recipes as unlockables, so there is nothing to actually discover, and you end up moving the ingredients one by one into grids. All of which could have been replaced by simply having a craft menu with required ingredients listed. Makes one wonder if the function was added for the sake of copying Minecraft.\n\nMany hours of fun if you're into designing your own private haven, sadly the limited resources mean that you have to restart the cycle in order to keep the game fresh. Apart from building, the game has very little to offer, and I would suggest taking any of the games which the game takes influences from. They all do what Craft the World does, except better in their own niché.\n\nThe game title is misleading, you don't craft the world, you make a base in it and exploit the natural resources.","June 23, 2014","false","26.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The reason I say this is because all though this game is a lot of fun and totally worth a buy it has some problems that seem like they would be very easy to fix.\nWhy on earth for example do we need to drag and drop every single ingrediant to the crafting table? Or why do the right and left mouse buttons do different things depending on what you are clicking on? Why can we not change the key bindings?

A lot of this game was designed to waste your time.  I know it's still early access but some stuff just makes no sense as to why the DEVS chose to make those choices.\n\n\nCrafting is a ton of click and drag.  You can't just auto make something if you have resources.  The least they could do is let us drag a stack so we can put the mats in quicker the way minecraft does.  Instead you can only move ONE SINGLE item to its slot.\n\n\nDwarves are randomly selected by the game to do a task.  Rather then the dwarf with the cook skill running over to cook.  The dwarf with the carpenter skill runs over to cook instead.\n\nYou have to make a TON of useless items BEFORE you even get access to the items you actually NEED.   The crafting tree doesn't let you actually focus on just the tools path.  You have to learn how to make walls, lights, furniture, food, glass, materials, wooden armor all before you can even use the steel ingot that the tree gives you access too.  You'll be mining silver and gold with an iron axe BEFORE you are using a steel pickaxe.  The crafting tree just needs major overhauling.\n\nA SINGLE replacement dwarf takes 5 minutes.\n\nA SINGLE Mana point takes 5 minutes to replinish.  So if you used up all 60 points of mana.  It'll take SIX HOURS real world time to fill back up fully.  The only way to make it go faster is if you level up.  Then it fills completly.  This is a freemium game mechanic.  Designed to make you want to buy mana refills for real world money.\n\nCan't move your starting stockpile.  So its totally exposed and you have no way of really making a shelter before night fall.  Just not happening.  Ghosts will be upon you way before then.  Also you won't be able to make any doors to use for your shelter until you travel the Civilization like crafting tree which limits you heavily in the early game.\n\nYour "inventory" is horrid cluttered.  You have to sift through tons of useless stuff to find what you are looking for.  Instead of going to the section that only shows the lighting.  You go to the section that has the lights, armor, tools, traps, walls,.\n\nCan't sell your items.  Once you upgrade your gear you end up with all this old gear that you can't do anything with.\n\nHave to cycle through your dwarves in order to find the one you are looking for rather then just pull down a menu that you can look at and quickly find the dwarf you are looking for.\n\nHopefully all this will change.  Spend so much resources collecting.  Some items take a ton of mats to make.  And there are just so many useless items and some items that make no sense.   The game has you have to make a fishing pole to fish.  After you make one then everyone can freely use it.  So why have to craft it at all?  Why not just let them fish automatically.  You don't even need to equip it.  Same with the buckets.\n\nDwarves move horrid slow.  And they have to travel back and forth.  You can use a portal but for somereason when they use it the timer on it speeds up.  So rather then be actually open for 4 minutes.  It ends up only open for like 2 minutes from the constant use.\n\n","April 16, 2014","false","12.2"," 25 of 47 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","25","47","0","0"

You start off with one dwarf who has nothing but a knife and you collect basic resources from the world, such as wood, earth, food, etc, and store them in your stockpile. Once you begin to collect resources, you are able to craft different items (for example, wood + stone = pickaxe). You can make armor, weapons, furniture, cook, fish, and a bunch of other things. Crafting allows you to level up. Every time you level up, your population of dwarves grows by 1 and you are able to accomplish more in a shorter amount of time. You will want to build a shelter before too long because monsters come out at night to attack your dwarves. You can either try to fight them off or hide in your shelter instead. Your dwarves can die, but when one does, another one generates in 5 minutes to take his place, so it's never really an issue.\n\nIt's a pretty easy game to get the hang of and you'll probably play for hours at a time like I do. The only negative thing about the game for me is that your dwarves can be kind of stupid at times (especially when you have a lot of them at once - I have 10 at the moment), such as attacking monsters when their health is low, getting lost in tunnels, doing things that don't make sense, etc. But I think that's a small price to pay for such an addictive game.

I have very few complaints about this game but here they are:\n- Gnomes sometimes fall through the floor if you are changing the shape of a wall piece they are standing on and they are unable to path their way out ofthe hole, you have to take control of that dwarfand jump out, quickly fix the hole and hope that another dwarf doesnt find his way in there while you are switching the block (pausing works but takes just as long to pause the game as it does to fix the hole)\n- Playing without the tech tree can leave you without some of the basic crafted materials until late in the game. I didnt get the recipe for clay untill after my dwarfs were decked out in silver armor and weapons.\n- There does not seem to be enough ore to go around in the small worlds, I found myself mining huge swaths of the underground to find a few pieces of iron or silver to finish an item\n\nOn the plus side, this game was worth every cent og the $18.99 I paid for it. Craft the world fits every expectation I have for a crafting/simulation game and it stands strong where others have fallen short.\n- The game play is easy to learn and the in game tutorials hold your hand at the begining but then let you run free when you are ready\n- The Gnomes do a great job of collecting every single piece of material left behind, sometimes it takes a while if you have dug a huge hole, cut down a bunch of trees, and purchased some stuff from the shop. The dwarf's carrying capacity is very limited and carrying 3 leaves is the same to them as carrying 3 chunks of stone but they get the job done eventually. Sometimes you just have to sit back and watch them scurry around or use one of the magic spells to help them along. The portal and imp spells work great for gathering large amounts of material left in one place.","March 23, 2015","true","20.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's plenty of fun, but it's far from complete, it still feels like an early beta stage testing of the game. The dwarves are dumb (but i'm use to that from dwarf fortress) and there is no tutorial, no website, and no instructions, the guides are almost non-existant and still being worked on.  So I mean there's a list of things wrong with this game, but...\n\nThe ideas are solid, the gameplay is fun and addicting, it just need to be polished and built up more. I would recommend pirating it first just to test out the very first verison. Of course it's full of bugs and problems, but if you like the game play, buying it on steam will get you all the patches and upgrades, which is worth it if you like the concept.\n\nThe art is different and refreshing; so many indie games have 8-bit art, seeing something that doesnt' do 8-bit and also uses some more modern graphics is nice.\n\nAlso about patches, the developer seems way into patches every 2/3 days ( it's been out for 10 days I think and there's already 4-5 patches/fixes). So if you are involved with the forums here they do listen and they do update often. Because this game is so early in the alpha, I look foward to coming back to this game every couple of weeks and seeing what they did.","November 30, 2013","true","47.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Bugs are still being ironed out and features are added. Does that mean that the game is un-enjoyable? No, quite the contrary. Even though the game is not a finished product I've enjoyed every single minute of gameplay that I've had the chance to experience so far.\n\nThe learning curve may be a bit steep (not compared to Dwarf's Fortress of course) and new players may have a hard time getting a proper shelter built before the waves of goblins and hordes of the undead start to harass your poor dwarves. You will however get the hang of it after some time, patience is a virtue after all. A small tip for all the other new players: If you want to get a good first impression of the game, do not make your first map a huge one with sandbox mode and permadeath. It'll drive you insane. Go for the campaign instead.\n\nThe graphics are similar to games like Terraria and Minecraft but every dwarf still has a nice and personal touch to them and the world is looking lush and fancy in general, do keep in mind that I have yet to try the snow map.\n\nGameplaywise I find it hard to describe what other games this title is similar to, especially since I've only played a few hours of Dwarf's Fortress and I haven't even tried Gnomoria (it seems like CTW is most commonly compared to these two titles). There are some occasional bugs here and there, longer work queues tend to make your small workers utterly confused and the not having the option to move your original stockpile may feel a bit annoying at times but for me that still doesn't prevent me from having a good time.\n\nOverall I really enjoy Craft The World and I would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of sandbox-style games, crafting and dwarves.","December 23, 2013","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At this point the problems are things like the AI being annoying and there not being a stop/cancel action function, really poor pathfinding, enemies spawning too close to your house (including at the door past your defences!), but otherwise it's okay. My biggest problem is that the tech tree is rather boring as you have to progress through every menial object including about 5 types of window to get to the good stuff, lumbering you with heaps of useless items which you don't seem to be able to destroy (and having crafted them, they're permanently marked in your inventory even if you don't have stock).\n\nBasically it's very annoying, but addictive...for a while.","December 29, 2013","true","13.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While it takes quite awhile to really get your dwarves to the point where they can defend themselves in an unforgiving world, most of the progression is relatively straightforward. Some of the early game quests could be ordered in a more logical fashion, the game won't mention that you have to place food on tables in order for your dwarves to consume it until well after your dwarves are complaining of being hungry. *This has since been addressed*\n\nSome resources are still being balanced as far as scarcity in the early stages of the game, but the recently introduced store means that if you're in need of some wool and haven't seen a sheep in ages you can always buy some for a few gold coins which you'll find interspersed throughout the landscape.\n\nIf you enjoy 2D sandbox style games you owe it to yourself to check out Craft the World, an attractive art style and entertaining gameplay along with regular updates ensure that this title is well worth the price of admission.","January 2, 2014","true","159.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Good value at the price too and very playable in early access; better in early release than some full release.\n\nSome pathing issues with dwarfs running into danger rather than out of it (especially archers).  Archers fire into the ground a lot.  Crafting tree is not logical - not sure that's a big issue but it does feel wrong.  It could probably use item tiers and item stats as per WoW and Terraria as well as an item class structure.  I'd suggest some routes of the crafting tree should preclude others, some could also only appear on accessing a new biome - which would give variety and a chance to explore different options later.  Save game at branch points would be good too. For me there's currently not enough gameplay to make subsequent campaign maps compelling.  They essentially just seem to change biome which tweaks a few aspects but not many and you're forced to rebuild & relearn the same crafting tree.  Better off I'd think with one world but multiple biomes (perhaps unlocked at edge of map) and the ability to set-up secondary bases in them.\n\nGiven that this is early access and it's quite good now there is plenty of scope for this to become an all time classic.\n\nWish list - add multiplayer and PVP.","January 9, 2014","true","21.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At this point the problems are things like the AI being annoying and there not being a stop/cancel action function, really poor pathfinding, enemies spawning too close to your house (including at the door past your defences!), but otherwise it's okay. My biggest problem is that the tech tree is rather boring as you have to progress through every menial object including about 5 types of window to get to the good stuff, lumbering you with heaps of useless items which you don't seem to be able to destroy (and having crafted them, they're permanently marked in your inventory even if you don't have stock).\n\nBasically it's very annoying, but addictive...for a while.","December 29, 2013","true","13.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxamemnon/recommended/248390/","foxamemnon","Jetpack John","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxamemnon/","487 products in account","This is a very enjoyable game.  Perhaps the best short description would be a cross between Dungeon Keeper and Terraria.  It is a 2D side-view game and the sprites and graphics are really quite well done.\n\nUnlike Terraria, however, you do not control a character (well, you can opt to temporarily assume control of an individual dwarf).  Instead, you indicate what you want done (mined, built, attacked, etc.) and the dwarves will take care of it according to their AI priorities.  After the last major update I think any remaining AI pathfinding issues have been resolved.  I've played for many hours post-update and I haven't had any problems with dwarves getting stuck or being unable to find their way home.  Due to pathfinding, at least.\n\nOne minor annoyance concerns filling in tunnels or pits.  If you order a bunch of blocks filled in, the exact order is unlikely to be the order you clicked on them.  As a result, depending on the layout of the tunnel/pit, a dwarf can be stuck at the end/bottom if the other end is sealed while they are busy filling the correct part.  Then you need to micromanage and reopen the area and fill only part at a time.  Fortunately, this particular issue does not occur very often.\n\nEven with my extremely positive view of the game, there are a few minor cons:\n\nOccasionally, there are some game mechanics which are unknown or confusing to the player (such as what a shelter is supposed to look like, or getting water on world 2).  A quick Google check will fix this, but the info should be in the game.\nYou can't make a shelter without walls, a roof, and doors, but these items lay several layers into the tech tree.  The problem is that your dwarves cannot heal until you have a shelter with beds.\nThose are my biggest annoyances, but in the grand scheme of things they're rather minor.  A number of other reviewers have complained about the tech tree resetting when you reach a new world (there are a total of three), but I would liken it to starting a new game of Minecraft on a newly generated world - you don't start with anything advanced in that case either.\n\nActually, I happen to like having the tech tree available.  It allows you to do a little bit of planning ahead, and having the recipes in-game means not having to check the Internet.  The first time you craft something you must drag materials onto the crafting grid, which is a bit silly.  Fortunately, after the first time you can simply click on the build button and the grid will be automatically filled for you which saves a lot of time and means there is no need to memorize the patterns (and there are a lot of them).\n\nGiven the price to hours played ratio, getting this game is a no-brainer.  Even if I had no interest in playing the second or third worlds it would still be completely worth buying.  If you enjoy world building sandbox type games or you enjoy building-by-proxy type games (ala Dungeon Keeper) then you'll certainly enjoy Craft the World.  It's worth buying at full price, and if you see it on sale then you should immediately jump on it.","March 4, 2015","true","63.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have very few complaints about this game but here they are:\n- Gnomes sometimes fall through the floor if you are changing the shape of a wall piece they are standing on and they are unable to path their way out ofthe hole, you have to take control of that dwarfand jump out, quickly fix the hole and hope that another dwarf doesnt find his way in there while you are switching the block (pausing works but takes just as long to pause the game as it does to fix the hole)\n- Playing without the tech tree can leave you without some of the basic crafted materials until late in the game. I didnt get the recipe for clay untill after my dwarfs were decked out in silver armor and weapons.\n- There does not seem to be enough ore to go around in the small worlds, I found myself mining huge swaths of the underground to find a few pieces of iron or silver to finish an item\n\nOn the plus side, this game was worth every cent og the $18.99 I paid for it. Craft the world fits every expectation I have for a crafting/simulation game and it stands strong where others have fallen short.\n- The game play is easy to learn and the in game tutorials hold your hand at the begining but then let you run free when you are ready\n- The Gnomes do a great job of collecting every single piece of material left behind, sometimes it takes a while if you have dug a huge hole, cut down a bunch of trees, and purchased some stuff from the shop. The dwarf's carrying capacity is very limited and carrying 3 leaves is the same to them as carrying 3 chunks of stone but they get the job done eventually. Sometimes you just have to sit back and watch them scurry around or use one of the magic spells to help them along. The portal and imp spells work great for gathering large amounts of material left in one place.","March 23, 2015","true","20.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now, be mindful, this is a very niche type of game. It's a 2d crafting/strategy/survival type game. You guide your dwarves to victory by showing them where to mine, cut, harvest, and fight. You gather your resources, build yourself a secure base and then seek out the parts of the portal to the next world. Survive, thrive, and build through your technology trees and ultimately build the portal and head to the next world.\n\nThe pathing is a little goofy at times but in those cases you can take direct control of a dwarf and provide a bit more direct guidance. So far I have been looking for the downside to this game and I really can't find anything that stands out. It's well made, fun (if you like this type of thing) and good for spending lots of casual hours exploring, crafting, and in general just having a good time with your stalwart little fellows.\n\nIt has a fairly large technology tree and the only one I had a bit of trouble with was the rail line which I am sure was my fault. I look forward to seeing what they come up with next. More tech, more enemies, and more fun?

Four hours later I was still playing XD It's definitely addictive and for all the right reasons.\n\nThe game is straightforward in its mechanics and so I didn't have to muddle through a long drawn out tutorial. Just here, have some dwarves, you should build a shelter, and then further prompts were given through the missions/quests. Crafting recipes made sense and nothing was unreasonably expensive. The things that were expensive were either the really strong stuff or the luxury decorative stuff. I also really liked that wood was not slow to get. A lot of games that rely on crafting will have the trees grow unreasonably slow and since wood is a component in just about everything that can really drag you into a waiting game. In Craft the World the trees resprout quickly so it's just a matter of getting your dwarves out to cut them down.\n\nA lot of games like this will have you research a new technology and then after doing so give you the option to craft. This game skips that and you fully research a technology by crafting. Given that you don't have a huge number of dwarves to work with (so far I've gotten to 12 dwarves on the second world) this choice makes sense and frees up a dwarf from being stuck on a research table. Like the crafting recipes the tech tree has a reasonably logical progression.\n\nEquipping them is also straightforward with your usual grading up from leather and stone to iron and onwards to mithril. There's a good mix of melee, archers, and mages. The difficulty curve on the monsters matches fairly well, you don't see or can avoid the stronger enemies until your dwarves are reasonably outfitted. Once you hit level 4 you do get monster portals which unleash a wave of monsters on you so proper planning and fortification of your dwarves' home is a must, but that's what online tutorials are for XD It does get a little rough after a while when three portals are opening at once, but you can either build a stupidly thick wall with eight doors or go into the game files and tweak the numbers so the waves aren't quite as brutal.\n\nThat's really the only major sticking point, though, and as I said there's options! It's definitely not enough to bother me for long. There are a few tiny bug issues, like sometimes when you call the dwarves home they'll get stuck, but if you take control of that dwarf for a second they bounce back and are cool, things like that which take a second to fix if that. Honestly the thing that annoys me is that there's no way to delete or possibly break down for resources older gear. My kids are running around with mithril, they don't need ten stone axes cluttering up the inventory XD But again, that's a nitpick and nothing that kills it.\n\nWhat I was pleasantly surprised about was the curve up. In campaign you have four planets that you unlock one by one. I was a little worried that the only difference in the second world was going to be a slightly larger map and maybe a few more monsters. However then out of nowhere the screen shook and my dwarves nearly got eaten and I probably shouldn't be as excited about that as I was XD There's tweaks to things with the second world and I expect the same will be true of the next two worlds to keep things interesting.\n\nI've owned this game a very short time and have already logged 50 hours on it. I definitely recommend it, just set an alarm to remind you to go to sleep sooner or later XD","July 4, 2015","true","18.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A simple goal driven game with a random map generator to keep it intersting. I do wish the crafting was actually fun..It's not. it's just the means to get to the next level.   One gathers the required resources each round, craft, and go to the next harder level...with the exact same crafting goals.\n\nEven with that said, I do recommend this game, as I have had a lot of fun playing it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dokta/recommended/248390/","dokta","The Dokta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dokta/","172 products in account","Another rehash of Dwarf Fortress (though I feel somewhat more faithful than others), Craft the World follows in a similar vein as Terraria and every other 2D side-on, grid-world game accused of being a Minecraft clone.\n\nWhat appealed to me specifically about this one is the ability to delegate tasks among a team of controllable characters, allowing them to build skills while creating increasingly better gear/environs for them to live in.\n\nUnfortunately - again, as is the case with so many Dorf Fawtwess remixes - the actual end product is a lot more stripped-down than I would have liked, with tasks almost arbitrarily assigned and a hell of a lot of struggling on the AI's end of things.\n\nFirstly, don't think you can leave your dwarves unattended:  They'll chase a pebble down a cliff into the waiting maw of some hideous monstrosity if you let them.  Alternatively, their AI might just choke, leaving them sitting on the spot until you give them a kicking (taking direct control for a while or recalling everyone to base seems to shake them out of it).  Furthermore, your dwarves are thick as bricks when it comes to combat, so you can expect them to die a lot on the higher difficulties because of their habit of leaving cover to crowdsurd the enemy horde.\n\nSecondly, there's no such thing as a quick game.  The fastest you can speed things up is double time and even then, your dwarves walk slower than a funeral procession.  Take into account some of the massive worlds you can generate and getting from one end to the other involves either spamming portal spells until your mana runs out or watching a movie while you wait for your guys to pick up a single log from the edge of the map.\n\nThe tech tree feels a little restrictive, forcing you to create a certain number of objects before allowing you to progress, which can get super frustrating if your base spawned in an area almost devoid of, say, iron.  I understand that a 'sandbox' tech tree mode is available, I'm just saying that in the campaign, it feels a bit cheap to have to make bucketloads of nails when what my dorfs really need is a good pickaxe.\n\nMind you, I've still managed to pour 65 infuriating hours into this game despite these shortcomings, and I'd say it's almost purely because I've got an unhealthy addiction to delegative fantasy sandbox worldbuilders with rpg elements.  This wasn't a great way to scratch that itch, but I'll recommend it to that very specific audience until I find something better.","July 7, 2015","true","65.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While that seems to be the extent of the story, it's more than enough to keep you and your dwarves digging deeper, darker tunnels, upgrading equipment and fighting increasingly difficult monsters.\n\nStill in development as of writing this, the game is not without its flaws. The tech tree is a little baffling in its design and you'll often find yourself mass-producing items you'll never use, but this is a minor quibble. The dwarves, while entertaining, lack depth in that they literally have no personalies or relationships beyond having a unique appearance and name.\n\nThe game's shortcomings do nothing to hamper your fun, however, and as mentioned before, you may find yourself losing an evening or two watching these little guys trying to survive.","June 19, 2014","true","68.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a bit like Terraria combined with Gnomoria.\n\nYou have your dwarves and get more as you unlock recipes or meet other goals. You harvest, craft, dig and fight off timedi nvasions of skeletons and other nasty critters. You don't really directly control your dwarves, you tell them what to do and they SLOWLY do it. Sound simple? Well, it is...sort of. Recipes get more complex. The monsters get tougher and there are more and more of them. You dig down further and further, meaning you need to find ways to get your dwarves back to the surface quickly. You expand your operations, putting greater and greater needs on basic resources like food, ore and wood. There's an element of luck with what you may find, meaning that you face roadblocks that you have to find ways around.\n\nThe real "gateway" in the game are the crafting recipes.You need to create a few of them in any given cateogry to advance to more complicated recipes in that category. Once you're at the end...well, I'm not going to spoil it for you but that's how you need to win. So the race is on between moving quickly enough to get the recipes before being overrun on the timed invasions. The game never felt frantic, but it did feel far more hectic and the end than during the leisurely beginning.\n\nThe dwarves are cute, the sounds ok and overall it's a nice little package. The crafting interface can get a bit cumbersome but overall it works well enough. And there's enough things to build that you can create some interesting areas. Mind you it's more limited than some games but there's more than enough here.\n\nPersonally, I only completed the first world. Going to the next one felt redundant. So while I'll "only" get 20 hours or so out of this, I got more than my money's worth because I bought it for less than $10 and those 20 hours were quite enjoyable.\n\nLooking for a cute Terraria/Gnomoria type of game with a colorful interface and isn't too challenging? Then this is for you. Enjoy.","March 24, 2015","true","23.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Because of stuff like the size and simplicity of icons and menu items, and the lack of tool tips, as if it’s meant to be easy to use with a touch pad. My concern with this is that it could detract from having more detailed features in interfaces.\n-----You can zoom out quite far. This seems to be really well implemented. Although everything becomes much smaller, you can distinguish different tiles very easily and see where monsters and your dwarves are. You can still manage your dwarves well from this perspective. You're not having to switch back and forth to a map where you lose control, which is pretty cool.\n\nI really like the idea of the game Dwarf Fortress. I've tried that but I couldn’t get my head around it. This is a lot more accessible albeit much simpler and features less depth.\n-----I also loved the old Dungeon keeper game and this reminded me of it. You also virtually build a dungeon in this. The Dwarves are a lot like the old Imps in Dungeon Keeper. You give them tasks in just the same way. Casting spells works very similarly too.\n-----The game has a tech tree. Each time you reach a new tech you are provided with recipes for the new items they unlock. So you don’t have to look up the wiki on an internet browser.\n-----But I don’t see the need for a minecraft style crafting grid in the first place. It’s not even as well implemented e.g. you have to slowly place the materials one at a time. In addition recipes just seem to be spoon fed to you so there is no difficulty in finding them. It kind of makes sense in a game like minecraft where it’s sort of like a simulation of assembling materials to craft items. But in this case your peasant dwarves should be taking care of these particulars lol (but seriously!)\n-----Also I don’t think the game should necessarily pause when are you in the inventory or crafting screens. The crafting grid would be more forgivable if your dwarves kept working on tasks you gave them while have to mess around with it.\n-----This being a side scroller, I sort of feel restricted only being able to move in four directions Sometimes I kind of wish the game had a third dimension. It would give it more depth, get it?! (but no seriously!). Maybe not a whole extra dimension lol. But perhaps mine entrances found on the map which would allow your dwarves to access instances much smaller than the main world where more ore and loot could be found.\n-----Next, you don’t seem to be able to move your stockpile. This is annoying if you want to build a Dwarf Fortress underground. This is where you would think dwarves would do so, right? Presumably this is to prevent you exploiting enemy A.I. which might have trouble reaching your base underground.\n-----There needs to be a better way to micromanage your dwarves. The only way I could see to do so was to cycle through them one at a time. A detailed list of your dwarves would be nice so that you could just look over it and quickly see who needs equipment, as well as their health, hunger and tiredness.\n-----The game has a tutorial system, but I can’t really remember it helping me nearly as much as all the recipes provided by unlocking new tech. As long as you can get your head around a few concepts you shouldn't really have a problem figuring out what to do. It also has ‘notes’ aka an in-game guide which I think should be broken up into dot-points or something so that it’s easier to follow.\n-----Dwarves must retrieve everything that you instruct them to place from the stockpile. I think that’s a good mechanic. But when you equip them with items such as tools and armour, they don’t need to go and get them from the stockpile. I think it would be cool if the game went one more step and made it so that your dwarves had to collect gear from the stockpile, rather than having it magically appear on them.\n-----This game has no multiplayer. I would really like to be able enjoy this game with a friend somehow.\n-----Regular game-speed is like slow motion, I virtually have it at a constant 2 times speed (the maximum). I would like to be able to speed the game up even faster, because I still often found myself doing nothing but waiting for my dwarves.\n-----I really liked that dwarves' skills progressed. It meant that they weren't expendable and was an incentive to protect them. But there behaviour tended to be counter intuitive e.g. mages blacksmithing instead of your smith. I think you should have more control over your dwarves e.g. be able restrict your smith to the shelter so that their role is limited only to crafting items.\n-----I think a lot of things on the tech tree should be optional or unlocked coincidentally. I spent way too much time building things that I didn't need or want, in order to progress through the tech tree e.g. decorative items in order to unlock mithril. The tech tree has some small non-linear features but ultimately tech progression is completely linear.\n-----Higher tier techs can be hard to acquire due to a limited amount of finite resources i.e. you may have trouble finding enough iron to craft items needed to make progress. Once you've crafted an item there is no way to get the resources back and eventually I exhausted every vein of ore and coal.\n-----The end game (i.e. of a world) wasn't very satisfying. You lose all your progress and begin from scratch in the next world. This is where I've stopped because I don't really want to have to go through the tech tree again.\n\n-----The best thing about this game was that your dwarves are basically autonomous. You just say what you want done and they will take care of it. I really like being the one pulling the strings, rather than doing all the labour solo.\n-----If I find the time I'm going to try out a custom game using different options, this may address some of the issues I had with the tech tree and lack of resources.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","November 27, 2014","true","18.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

My friend had it and I did a "trial play" with it. You can get trapped for HOURS playing if you don't mind the clock. I love the multi dwarf control and leveling aspect. Very much so like many other crafting games such as gnomoria, terraria, minecraft, etc but still with it's own special individuality. You can be very attentive or pretty lazy if you'd like. The game allows you to lay out tasks for the dwarves to do and so long as they're fed and well rested they do their own thing. Mind the clock however; swarms come every 40 mins or so as well as creatures during the dark. Unlocking new crafting tiers seems to be a chore later on as you level though but still fun.\n\nAll in all a wonderful game!","July 20, 2014","true","97.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took me some time to get some of the basic elements at the start of the game (that you start with a totem you can place instead of having to build one from scratch, for example). The end goal of the first level is also difficult to suss out, and I ended up spending a significant amount of time advancing all the tech trees to their maximum when it wasn't strictly necessary to succeed.\n\nThose issues aside, the game is a lot of fun. Whether you treat your dwarves as disposable labourers, or care about them like a family, you'll find things to love about the game. Harvesting resources, building your fortress, and basically showing off your mastery over your environment make this game great fun. The nightly monster raids provide an extra element of danger and amusement, another challenge to overcome.\n\nProbably a good idea to check out a gameplay video first, to make sure it's up your alley, but I for one had a lot of fun with the game.","June 21, 2014","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The price seemed high (for me), but the game appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. I have only played a couple of hours so far, so this review is based primarily on first impressions.\n\nPricing - A little high for my taste in games, but VERY much worth the cost. Especially if the developers continue their updates as frequently as they have done in the past. I was hesitant to pay so much for an incomplete game, but the finished portions of the game are well worth the price. And, unlike other Early Access Games I have bought, this game does not suffer from the glitches and crashes that I've experienced with other developers.\n\nGraphics - Simplistic, but effective. Everything is clear and runs smoothly. Thus far, I have had no hangups, freezes, or game crashes (playing on a WIn 8 64-bit laptop). My actual gametime is still low, so I may encounter issues further on. But, none of the technical issues that have been detailed in the forum have affected me yet.\n\nSound - I can't really comment because I always turn the music off and lower sound effects in a game before I begin playing. I like the fact the you can adjust the ambient sounds, sound effects, and music separately. I would recommend leaving the sound effects turned on so you can hear the advancing enemies coming towards you (from off-screen).\n\nYou start with a single dwarf dropped on an island. Immediately, you begin chopping trees and bushes for wood and food. Then digging into the ground to build your fortress. As you gather supplies, you can begin crafting items - better tools, weapons, armor, both decorative and useful items, etc. The list is impressive - hatches, bridges, workbenches, cooked food, furniture. Complete your tasks to advance your tech tree. As you level up, you'll receive additional dwarves to help out. And drops will randomly include textbooks to teach your dwarves new skills (each dwarf is allowed three learned skills, one is already included when they first arrive).\n\nThe crafting system is very well done. Though I have not attempted the sandbox mode yet, I've read that the requirements and layout of the crafting grid must be memorized. I'm not sure that I'll like that part whenever I try it. You drag the needed materials into a grid to craft an item, but placement of the materials is important. Two crafted items may require the same ingredients placed in different positions on the grid. If you place them wrong, you may craft something other than what you were attempting.\n\nPersonally, I prefer the exploration, building, and crafting over the fighting and defense aspects of any game. CtW allowed me a few day cycles to grow before throwing the enemy armies at me. There were ghosts and skeletons and zombies early in the game, but they are easily dispatched. Or, you can hide in your fort until morning when they leave. I finally quit my first run in the game when the first enemy portal opened - with armored skeletons, pirate ghosts, giant zombies, and (gasp!) a Beholder! My dwarves survived the night, but barely. I did not have enough beds for all of them (I did not explore enough of the world to find the supplies I needed).\n\nThat first major wave of enemies was enough for me to exit the game. Not out of frustration, but because I felt that I had learned enough to do better the next run. LOL\n\nI can't recommend this game enough. My favorite game has been Lantern Forge, though it has some stability issues that have not been corrected yet (crashing after a short time playing). Craft the World, for an Early Access Game, plays like a final product. I can foresee many hours of my life lost whilst in this game world.\n\nA few suggestions for improvements:\n1. Allow re-naming the individual dwarves for a more 'personal' experience. Possibly add some limited customization of their appearance & skills.\n2. Allow a 'roll-around' scrolling through your dwarves. My newest dwarf is always the one that needs the newly created weapon or armor. It would be nice to back-arrow to him rather than scroll through each of my other dwarves.\n3. Identify when an onscreen item belongs to a specific dwarf. I may have missed something, but I only had four beds for my six dwarves (due to a lack of grass) and the last two dwarves would not use the open beds. Apparently, another dwarf had 'claimed' it first. I have not found a way to determine ownership.\n4. Definitely open the Store. Even if you can only trade for decorative items or clothing options.","August 19, 2014","true","111.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a lot of things that I would have added to the cons list a couple of months ago, but they've been fixed.\n\nWell worth your money!

Still in development, this sandbox strategy game Craft the World described by the developers as a "mix of Dungeon Keeper﻿, Terreria PC game﻿ and Dwarf Fortress﻿".\n\nWhat a frustrating game that I have spent dozens of hours playing. Well, not the game, really, but the stupid dwarves. Almost every update includes the line "Improved dwarves AI", and with good reason—they never seem to be doing what you want them to be doing! But the game is a lot of fun, stupid dwarf AI aside. Well, except for the game-breaking bug that I encountered, 30+ hours of playtime into one of my worlds, but that kind of hazard is par for the course when playing Alpha/Beta/"Early Access" games.\n\nMy biggest complaint would be that you spend a lot of time waiting: waiting for dwarves to get where they're going, to finish what they're doing, to bring stuff back when they're done, etc. After I experienced the aforementioned game-breaking bug, I started again, but I would frequently give my dwarves a bunch of orders, leave (my computer), and then come back later. So I think this game would benefit a great deal from a "fast-foward" feature (accelerated in-game time).\n\nAnyway, I'm done playing this (for now, at least). I'll keep an eye on its development, but I probably won't pick it up again until it reaches "full" release. And even if I never actually return to it, I'd say that I got my "money's worth" out of it Well, Nanimonai's money—Thanks, Nani!","July 12, 2014","true","103.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

A few little bugs here and there but still really compelling gameplay. It starts off a little slow but the sense of progression as you increase your small army of dwarves and improve your base of operations is something I don't get to experience much in other games.\n\nI really enjoy experimenting with building traps and different layouts to work out which is best to fight off the hordes of enemies that can appear every so often or during the night. Part of the fun is working out a strategy which keeps you alive, as dying dwarves drop all of their gear and you lose the progress they had.

I don't often return to games (mainly due to massive backlog and I don't stick with one game too long).\n\nIn it's current state as of 2014.06.26, I've spent ~20 hours on this game.  It's at the top of my most played for the current Steam sale, so I think that's saying something positive about the game.\n\nI enjoy the "spells" - Imps can haul stuff, a rally point can be placed (vital against enemy armies), and most valuable is a portal spell massively cuts downtime, and I feel is a much better replacement for any sort of speed controls (except pause!).  When relying on speed controls, I'm basically sitting there *not* playing the game.  The pace can be a bit slow, especially in the beginning, but as more Dwarves are added, I find it more fun to spend my time micromanaging them.\n\nThe ability to play as a Dwarf removes any "wait" time, as I can possess a poor soul, and work him to death (it's great that I'm able to plop down anything from inventory while controlling a Dwarf, which removes the need for me to manually walk alllllll the way back to the stockpile, then allllllllll the way back to where I need to place it).  Exploring is fun, even though manually digging through a line of blocks can be tedious.\n\nEnemy waves are great - I love "defend the fort" games, so applying a bit of pressure from monsters keeps the game alive for me.  The game turns into a tower defense during invasions sometimes.\n\nOf course, the main "feature" of the game is crafting.  I'm able to get through the current crafting tree at a decent pace, although I question the placement of quite a few technologies.  Why is farming so far into the tree?  Twice now, by the time I've reached the ability to farm, I've had a massive stockpile of food - so when I reach it, I can go through over 400 seeds and set my cook to make food to last the "rest of the game" (whenever that is).  I think having separate categories for technologies would be a better approach, and have a more natural feel to tech progression; a "food" technology, "weapons/armor", "building construction", "decorations", and maybe one or two more.  I wouldn't mind having to grind more through each tier in this case - it would just mean a larger stock of inventory as I go through it.","June 26, 2014","true","161.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game does have an option to speed up play for those who don't know. I typically play at 2x speed. There is a lot to get out of the game if you give it a chance. The artwork is funny the leveling system is the typical exponential XP leveler. So getting over level 13 will be almost impossible. The typical board should last around 20 hrs at 2x speed. Every 45 minutes of game time the game ramps up the difficulty. If you think you found the best defense think again, the AI seems to adapt. The first 3 levels are all different and the map sizes are also customizable if you play custom. So overall for an early access I have enjoyed this game longer than a ton of full releases. I have to admit that I plan on playing this game for way over 200 hours. For $15 that means I paid only 7.5 cents for each hour of fun. For the price of 3 coffees at Starbucks you too can enjoy this game for 200 hours. as well.

There are a few things I think would make the game more enjoyable, and in some cases less of an aggravation.\n\n1) Allow the  sandbox mode to eliminate the regular invasions.  As of now the invasions occur about every 40-45 minutes, and they last quite awhile and often times early on it's just too much to handle without incurring some losses and more importantly the loss of time it takes to recover from said invasion.  If you are like me, and you've played through a campaign or two and you just want to build, the 40-45 minute invasions, while it may seem a long time is much much too regular and completely aggravating when all you want to do is clear out that last tunnel to make room for your long railroad. As of now, Tech mode, Sandbox, and the campaign all allow for these pesky massive invasions.\n\n2)More actual useful spells.  Magic light isn't all that helpful, imp spell doesn't help a whole lot and in some cases crashes the game, horn spell can be buggy.\n\n3)The AI is a bit odd, it would be nice to be able to assign multiple dwarves to specific tasks rather than have a few dwarves pass up the loot on the ground to go after that one block you qued up a long time ago at the very edge of the map.\n\n4)Speed up dwarf movement a bit or increase the carrying capacity.  I know the portal spell is suppose to remedy this situation for large mining excursions but damn they still move slowly when burdened and lug only, what 3 items?\n\n5)A second earlier back up save to each game might fix the problem I currently found myself into the game.  30 hours in and I have a critical crash bug at the point where the game decided to save.  So now any time I attempt to load this game it immediately crashes to desktop.  No I did not use imps, just 11 dwarves, massive invasions and way too much loot got to be a bit taxing I suppose.\n\nThat's all from me I think, As I said before, I've really enjoyed the game and I highly reccomend it.  I really hope some of these issues are addressed in the future, and look forward to what's to come.","March 14, 2014","true","168.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Still in development, this sandbox strategy game Craft the World described by the developers as a "mix of Dungeon Keeper﻿, Terreria PC game﻿ and Dwarf Fortress﻿".\n\nWhat a frustrating game that I have spent dozens of hours playing. Well, not the game, really, but the stupid dwarves. Almost every update includes the line "Improved dwarves AI", and with good reason—they never seem to be doing what you want them to be doing! But the game is a lot of fun, stupid dwarf AI aside. Well, except for the game-breaking bug that I encountered, 30+ hours of playtime into one of my worlds, but that kind of hazard is par for the course when playing Alpha/Beta/"Early Access" games.\n\nMy biggest complaint would be that you spend a lot of time waiting: waiting for dwarves to get where they're going, to finish what they're doing, to bring stuff back when they're done, etc. After I experienced the aforementioned game-breaking bug, I started again, but I would frequently give my dwarves a bunch of orders, leave (my computer), and then come back later. So I think this game would benefit a great deal from a "fast-foward" feature (accelerated in-game time).\n\nAnyway, I'm done playing this (for now, at least). I'll keep an eye on its development, but I probably won't pick it up again until it reaches "full" release. And even if I never actually return to it, I'd say that I got my "money's worth" out of it Well, Nanimonai's money—Thanks, Nani!","July 12, 2014","true","103.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It starts off a little slow but the sense of progression as you increase your small army of dwarves and improve your base of operations is something I don't get to experience much in other games.\n\nI really enjoy experimenting with building traps and different layouts to work out which is best to fight off the hordes of enemies that can appear every so often or during the night. Part of the fun is working out a strategy which keeps you alive, as dying dwarves drop all of their gear and you lose the progress they had. (They respawn after a few minutes however)\n\nThis is a great game and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing a sandbox game.","June 28, 2014","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is an almost perfect marriage of Strategy, role-playing and building sim. I look forward to seeing where this goes in the future with more content being promised. This is definitely worth the early purchase, and puts most other "early acces" games to shame with the sheer amount of replayability and fun it has in its current incomplete state.","June 30, 2014","true","28.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great fun. It is a slow paced game so that means you can take your time and just relax as you go on, however the level constantly gets harder over time. I may have only put 5 hours in, but i have enjoyed 90% of it. the 10% came from learning how to eat and sleep (long story). To sleep, you must build a proper hous (totem, beds, roof, walls, backwalls and a door/wooden Hatch) then they will sleep. To eat, all you need to do is make a table, make the food then place the food on the table. To do that you just add the food to your quick bar and then place them on the table as if you you where adding a wall/backwall.","April 17, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So far I have been playing the game for around 25 hours and it is starting to get boring now.\n\nThe game is a 2d based survival/crafting game with a daily cycle where monsters spawn during the night. The monsters get a bit tougher the longer you play, but to be hornest it isnt realy a challenge. When not fighting monsters you are collecting materials in order for you to progress through out the techtree. The techtree is very long and even though I have spent many hours playing I have not yet finnished the techtree(mostly because of restarts). When you are collecting resources under the ground you will sometimes find secret caves, one of these caves will hold a damaged portal. To finnish a map you will have to repair the portal by obtaining different artifacts from monsters in other caves. Which you will need  some late game equipment for.\n\nAll in all it is a good game but mostly because of the prise, I think i got it for 3-4 euro. There seems to be missing a storyline or something that keeps you playing. There is a lot of waiting in the game and sometimes it feels like you are just building stuff you dont need, in order to complete the techtree. I belive this game is still in alpha stage so I guess there will be some fixes in the future.\n\nI recommend this game based on the time played vs the money spent on the game. I hope someone can use my review :D\n\n","April 20, 2014","true","52.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's sort of like a Dwarf Fortress Lite game, which makes me long for DF and realize how intelligently DF (despite its UI issues) is designed.\n\nThis review will be updated regularly.\n\n\nPros:\n- Nice gameplay graphics.\n- Most game elements are fairly intuitive. (Though some of the buildings could use a bit more in-game instruction, like the elevator, but that's obviously not a priority in Early Access.)\n- The spells are a great way to engage the player, and are very useful, though mana recharge takes a while.\n- Controls are generally intuitive and work well.\n- Controlling an individual dwarf is generally very effective, though controlling the individual's movement relative the landscape can sometimes be tricky, and it's hard to execute some of the maneuvers dwarves do on their own.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Crappy UI graphics. The UI could be improved upon design-wise, and made to supply more information (like how long until nightfall, etc.)\n- UPDATE 5/29: They've updated the UI. It looks much better now, and has more functionality. Will update further when I have a chance to really sit down and play for a few hours to explore the new UI. :)\n\n- The drag and drop crafting system is extremely annoying. Make me do it once to start, sure, but offer an autofill option?\n\n- Needs recycling or selling items, I have a bunch of goblin crap I don't need.\n\n- Dwarves can't handle their own food supplies. When you get a lot of dwarves, they go through that food pretty fast, and you have to manually tell them to cook it, and also manually click a bunch to put it out on the table! Really makes me wish it had a system like DF where you just tell the dwarves what they can eat and cook with, and they'll automatically go get their own food. Maybe what CtW needs is a larder object where food is automatically stored, and dwarves can get it from the larder and bring it to tables themselves?\n\n- Enemy raids happen too often. Late in the game, you often have to go very far afield to gather resources, and while elevators and rails are helpful, it's still a lot of travel time. So here I am, working at the edge of the map, and suddenly I have to abandon everything I'm doing and send everyone back to base because a raid is happening. Probably ten minutes out of every hour is spent dealing with stupid raids, and the defensive towers you can build aren't effective enough. Basically your tower has to be so close to the ground to hit an enemy that they can reach it and take it out easily. Towers also aren't very powerful, meaning nearly every assault (even some minor, regular nighttime ones) requires your attention to dispatch dwarves away from whatever more productive thing they could be doing. I am presently trying to figure out a way to just prevent raiders from accessing my base, period, but so far it's been difficult coming up with a way that works. I really want to be able to focus on getting what I need to complete the level rather than dealing with giant assaults every 45 minutes.\n\n- The skill tree has some merits, but it's super annoying and frustrating to have to waste precious resources crafting a bunch of items you do not need in your fort. Maybe some form of a research to unlock technology system would be better. An invention workshop that consumes raw materials to develop blueprints/new technology?\n\n- The skill tree doesn't have the greatest progression. Some techs you would think are fairly basic, like farming and weaving, are mid-to-late game technologies. Some of the progression (you need alchemy to advance farming?) just seems to be set up to make the game more tedious.\n\n- On a related note, some form of animal husbandry, where you can just put sheep or chickens in a pen or some sort of have then generate wool and eggs would be great. Wool is incredibly important, and can be very time-consuming to obtain when you have to wait for sheep to spawn and send dwarves to the edge of the map to kill them.\n\n- Dwarves' pathing and job handling is often ridiculously poor. A dwarf carries a torch to the very edge of the map, where you need some light added. It runs into a monster. It drops the torch to fight the monster. It picks the torch back up. Does it resume placing the torch? No, it has to walk all the way back to the main base, because while the dwarf was fighting, the base dispatched a different dwarf to install the torch, and that dwarf has only just started its walk.\n\n- Hit a bug where acquiring 999 earth caused all my queued actions on the map to disappear. This happened twice, I ended up crazily just trying to use up earth so it wouldn't hit 999 (wasting a bunch of time by basically having dwarves run around installing earth back walls everywhere) and the bug seems to have gone away, though queued actions are sometimes dropping out, and this may still be to blame. Not certain.\n\n- Spawn rates of flora/mushrooms/crystals and stuff are really high, to the point where trying to mine out a block under a tree took forever because before a dwarf could arrive to mine the block after the tree was cut down, a new tree would grow. Sometimes five or six attempts required. Same issue with crystal and mushroom growth while trying to build a railroad underground.\n\n- There seems to be a max height for tree growth, so my attempts to create a dome of trees to protect my base were unsuccessful.\n\n- It's taking a really long to clear out what seems to be the first "level" of the game. 30+ hours.","April 26, 2014","true","46.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took me some time to get some of the basic elements at the start of the game (that you start with a totem you can place instead of having to build one from scratch, for example). The end goal of the first level is also difficult to suss out, and I ended up spending a significant amount of time advancing all the tech trees to their maximum when it wasn't strictly necessary to succeed.\n\nThose issues aside, the game is a lot of fun. Whether you treat your dwarves as disposable labourers, or care about them like a family, you'll find things to love about the game. Harvesting resources, building your fortress, and basically showing off your mastery over your environment make this game great fun. The nightly monster raids provide an extra element of danger and amusement, another challenge to overcome.\n\nProbably a good idea to check out a gameplay video first, to make sure it's up your alley, but I for one had a lot of fun with the game.","June 21, 2014","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game does have an option to speed up play for those who don't know. I typically play at 2x speed. There is a lot to get out of the game if you give it a chance. The artwork is funny the leveling system is the typical exponential XP leveler. So getting over level 13 will be almost impossible. The typical board should last around 20 hrs at 2x speed. Every 45 minutes of game time the game ramps up the difficulty. If you think you found the best defense think again, the AI seems to adapt. The first 3 levels are all different and the map sizes are also customizable if you play custom. So overall for an early access I have enjoyed this game longer than a ton of full releases. I have to admit that I plan on playing this game for way over 200 hours. For $15 that means I paid only 7.5 cents for each hour of fun. For the price of 3 coffees at Starbucks you too can enjoy this game for 200 hours. as well.

It's mainly a rush to get armor weapons and tools, then go on to the next world (you half to restart btw when you go to a new world) waves of monsters spawn and if you don't have 5 dwarfs with at least wood armor you will lose 1-3 dwarfs. game moves really slowly even with 2x speed (note its f1 f2 and f3 to speed up no idea why no one just asks) biggest thing i hate is, mana regen witch is use for your spells, It takes 5 mins to regen 1 mana of real time not game time. The wiki says that your mana is meant to regen even when your not playing, but gets bugged every update. o and the lovely crafting tree even if you are starting another game or world the crafting tree needs to be reunlock every time and even if you know the recipe it will not let you craft it tell you unlock the category.all and all it was fun while it lasted, but gets boring when you try to reply it, needs to have an unlock for the crafting tree after you finish the last world. 6/10 not worth more then $10 hope to see mod support later on, and more updates to add more worlds and more items and magic. might update review later on.","June 23, 2014","true","81.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fantastic visuals, great gameplay, and highly polished. Gameplay is simplistic, but it suits the game just fine as it's all about letting the dwarves do all the dirty work while you relax.\n\nIt would be great to have some variation in goals, as currently you just have to keep digging deeper until you find the scrolls for the next world's portal and just get the recipe requirements. But again, the simple formula still works beautifully for this game.\n\nJust make sure you don't get confused when you go to the developer's official website, as there are no mentions of the game and instead is filled with Flash games.

It took me some time to get some of the basic elements at the start of the game (that you start with a totem you can place instead of having to build one from scratch, for example). The end goal of the first level is also difficult to suss out, and I ended up spending a significant amount of time advancing all the tech trees to their maximum when it wasn't strictly necessary to succeed.\n\nThose issues aside, the game is a lot of fun. Whether you treat your dwarves as disposable labourers, or care about them like a family, you'll find things to love about the game. Harvesting resources, building your fortress, and basically showing off your mastery over your environment make this game great fun. The nightly monster raids provide an extra element of danger and amusement, another challenge to overcome.\n\nProbably a good idea to check out a gameplay video first, to make sure it's up your alley, but I for one had a lot of fun with the game.","June 21, 2014","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though it's not flawless, I was impressed, it does take some planning to keep it from breaking/digging into it your stuff.\n\nI really wish item progression was not so "the next stuff is just overall better, so give it to as many dwarves as you can". It would have been nice you have the option of mage armor for example, that could perhaps raise mage damage but not so great at defense. Perhaps the heaver stuff would slow your dwarves down in combat? Maybe giving you the option of giving the lighter stuff to archers?\n\nOverall, it's still a good game.

I have always been intrigued by the idea of the legendary dwarf fortress but could never get over the archaic visual look of it (I do love tons of old video games but I find it hard to go back to the 80/90s and be enamored in the same way at that time). The reviews indicated Craft the World was a good mix of the dwarf fortress feel with nice visual aesthetics appended with aspects of dungeon keeper (an old favorite) and minecraft.\n\nOverall I’ve had a blast with the game. It is a ton of fun exploring and seeing what lies beneath the next few blocks of mineable ground -- new enemies, new treasures, new hidden rooms, etc. The tech tree is relatively easy to understand and progresses naturally. Sometimes it gets a bit bogged down in forcing you to craft meaningless items to advance a particular branch but I’d still give it a 4/5 overall.\n\nThe graphics and sound are exactly what I’d expect—charming. The game is challenging but not too difficult if you plan well.\n\nIf you have any interest in watching a civilization playout ala sim-games/civilization/etc this game is perfect for you.

The music is nice and context-sensitive in a way I can appreciate.  The graphics are pretty good.  The campaign feels a little repetitive since you wind up crafting mostly the same things each time to progress, but the worlds are different enough that it stays fresh enough to be fun.  Learning how to properly defend your base without outright exploiting enemy AI is fun, even in the world type where a large portion of the incoming enemies ignore doors and fortifications.\n\nHowever, it feels incomplete in some ways.  The tech tree's progression is really weird, like, sometimes you have to grind out decoration objects in order to unlock better equipment, or do some cooking to unlock things unrelated to cooking.  The pathing AI can glitch out when dealing with water, dwarves jump into pits sometimes, mages waste spells on weak or caged enemies, and most noticably, cave goblins will sometimes just freeze in place once they get near your base, not even fighting back.  Cave goblins also get stuck doing tasks they cannot complete, like clearing vegetation too far away from where they are standing.\n\nThe difficulty curve is really weird as well.  The first few nights are absurdly dangerous as you have ineffective weapons, no armor, limited resources, and few dwarves.  As soon as you get even basic fortifications the difficulty takes a nosedive, and never picks back up.\n\nEven so, the game is really fun.","September 9, 2015","true","169.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In other words, this is a game you can jump right into, but it has taken several playthroughs for me to really become efficient at levelling.\n\nAt its heart, this game is a crafting game.  It doesn't suffer from the pitfalls of most other crafting games, either.  The inventory is easy to sort, and the skilltree makes it fun to progress.  There are also battles that require a bit of strategy to overcome.  There is a timer that counts down to the next major attack, and half of the goal is to make sure that the Dwarf's home is prepared to take on the onslaught of demons.  Each onslaught is slightly more difficult than the one before it.   I've found that a dwarf colony with just the right efficiency can stay a step ahead of these onslaughts until the end when it's a race to get as much mythril ore as possible to get every dwarf fully buffed.\n\nI've played through this game several times, and I intend to play through it again.

I can look past the various bugs which really arent that bad but can be some what annoying.  All in all its mildly disapointing but still enjoyable up to about 30 or so hours.

It's sort of like a Dwarf Fortress Lite game, which makes me long for DF and realize how intelligently DF (despite its UI issues) is designed.\n\nThis review will be updated regularly.\n\n\nPros:\n- Nice gameplay graphics.\n- Most game elements are fairly intuitive. (Though some of the buildings could use a bit more in-game instruction, like the elevator, but that's obviously not a priority in Early Access.)\n- The spells are a great way to engage the player, and are very useful, though mana recharge takes a while.\n- Controls are generally intuitive and work well.\n- Controlling an individual dwarf is generally very effective, though controlling the individual's movement relative the landscape can sometimes be tricky, and it's hard to execute some of the maneuvers dwarves do on their own.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Crappy UI graphics. The UI could be improved upon design-wise, and made to supply more information (like how long until nightfall, etc.)\n- UPDATE 5/29: They've updated the UI. It looks much better now, and has more functionality. Will update further when I have a chance to really sit down and play for a few hours to explore the new UI. :)\n\n- The drag and drop crafting system is extremely annoying. Make me do it once to start, sure, but offer an autofill option?\n\n- Needs recycling or selling items, I have a bunch of goblin crap I don't need.\n\n- Dwarves can't handle their own food supplies. When you get a lot of dwarves, they go through that food pretty fast, and you have to manually tell them to cook it, and also manually click a bunch to put it out on the table! Really makes me wish it had a system like DF where you just tell the dwarves what they can eat and cook with, and they'll automatically go get their own food. Maybe what CtW needs is a larder object where food is automatically stored, and dwarves can get it from the larder and bring it to tables themselves?\n\n- Enemy raids happen too often. Late in the game, you often have to go very far afield to gather resources, and while elevators and rails are helpful, it's still a lot of travel time. So here I am, working at the edge of the map, and suddenly I have to abandon everything I'm doing and send everyone back to base because a raid is happening. Probably ten minutes out of every hour is spent dealing with stupid raids, and the defensive towers you can build aren't effective enough. Basically your tower has to be so close to the ground to hit an enemy that they can reach it and take it out easily. Towers also aren't very powerful, meaning nearly every assault (even some minor, regular nighttime ones) requires your attention to dispatch dwarves away from whatever more productive thing they could be doing. I am presently trying to figure out a way to just prevent raiders from accessing my base, period, but so far it's been difficult coming up with a way that works. I really want to be able to focus on getting what I need to complete the level rather than dealing with giant assaults every 45 minutes.\n\n- The skill tree has some merits, but it's super annoying and frustrating to have to waste precious resources crafting a bunch of items you do not need in your fort. Maybe some form of a research to unlock technology system would be better. An invention workshop that consumes raw materials to develop blueprints/new technology?\n\n- The skill tree doesn't have the greatest progression. Some techs you would think are fairly basic, like farming and weaving, are mid-to-late game technologies. Some of the progression (you need alchemy to advance farming?) just seems to be set up to make the game more tedious.\n\n- On a related note, some form of animal husbandry, where you can just put sheep or chickens in a pen or some sort of have then generate wool and eggs would be great. Wool is incredibly important, and can be very time-consuming to obtain when you have to wait for sheep to spawn and send dwarves to the edge of the map to kill them.\n\n- Dwarves' pathing and job handling is often ridiculously poor. A dwarf carries a torch to the very edge of the map, where you need some light added. It runs into a monster. It drops the torch to fight the monster. It picks the torch back up. Does it resume placing the torch? No, it has to walk all the way back to the main base, because while the dwarf was fighting, the base dispatched a different dwarf to install the torch, and that dwarf has only just started its walk.\n\n- Hit a bug where acquiring 999 earth caused all my queued actions on the map to disappear. This happened twice, I ended up crazily just trying to use up earth so it wouldn't hit 999 (wasting a bunch of time by basically having dwarves run around installing earth back walls everywhere) and the bug seems to have gone away, though queued actions are sometimes dropping out, and this may still be to blame. Not certain.\n\n- Spawn rates of flora/mushrooms/crystals and stuff are really high, to the point where trying to mine out a block under a tree took forever because before a dwarf could arrive to mine the block after the tree was cut down, a new tree would grow. Sometimes five or six attempts required. Same issue with crystal and mushroom growth while trying to build a railroad underground.\n\n- There seems to be a max height for tree growth, so my attempts to create a dome of trees to protect my base were unsuccessful.\n\n- It's taking a really long to clear out what seems to be the first "level" of the game. 30+ hours.","April 26, 2014","true","46.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Craft the World is effectively Lemmings meets Terraria and while there are plenty of bugs to be squashed, it's still a fun game. The quick hits:\n\n- Dwarves\n- 2D side-scroller with great looking graphics\n- sandbox world to do whatever you please\n- You can beat sheep with clubs!\n- full tech tree to unlock new objects, craft more powerful items, and make the perfect lava lamp for your Dwarf home\n- standard survival mechanics with enemies, hunger, et al\n- more beards than you can shake a stick at!\n\nOverall a fun game.

The level of detail is outstanding and there is so much to keep you interested and busy in the game I keep coming back for more. It is a great game to have open even if you can't devote 100% attention to it..just set your dwarves to work and you can easily browse the web or talk on the phone. But be careful because once nightfall arrives you may need to turn your focus to fighting off a zerg of enemy mobs.\n\nI am especially enjoying the campaign mode as it provides a good introduction to the crafting system and slowly opens up the world allowing you time to build up your resources. I do wish things were explained a bit better but at this stage in the development the game does a great job of walking you through.\n\nThe developers did a great job with this gem of a game and they are very active with providing updates to the game.\n\nI am hopeful the dev's will add a few convenience features and better help text to the game, especially as it relates to building a suitable shelter early on in the game. But overall the game is very enjoyable and playable upon early release.\nDon't let the tablet style game graphics turn you off to this game. Give it a try and you won't be sorry!\n","December 3, 2013","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took me some time to get some of the basic elements at the start of the game (that you start with a totem you can place instead of having to build one from scratch, for example). The end goal of the first level is also difficult to suss out, and I ended up spending a significant amount of time advancing all the tech trees to their maximum when it wasn't strictly necessary to succeed.\n\nThose issues aside, the game is a lot of fun. Whether you treat your dwarves as disposable labourers, or care about them like a family, you'll find things to love about the game. Harvesting resources, building your fortress, and basically showing off your mastery over your environment make this game great fun. The nightly monster raids provide an extra element of danger and amusement, another challenge to overcome.\n\nProbably a good idea to check out a gameplay video first, to make sure it's up your alley, but I for one had a lot of fun with the game.","June 21, 2014","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The basic concept is to setup house and work for a group of Dwarves who've just arrived to a new world from beyond a portal.  You'll need to collect materials, craft (weapons, armor, furniture, etc) all while defending them from a relentless onslaught of creatures.  It's a nice combination, which I do reccomend.\n\nDownside:  Once you've finished the first world, the game takes you to a new map with a new biom and new creatures, but the gameplay is essentially the same.  Your crafting starts over and you get all new first level dwarves.   Would be nice if you could keep at least one dude from map to map.\n\nThat said, I've played this game for hours and would definintely reccomend it to anyone looking for a nice combination of crafting and psuedo tower defense.","November 20, 2015","true","131.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great looking game with a beautiful artstyle and plenty of depth.

Then just choose recipe and hit the green anvil 2 times, to build the recipe. Learned this after 50+ hours of game time and a very sore hand.\n- You CAN speed up time. Especially useful in the beginning and between raids. Click the "moon-wheel" in the top right corner.\n\nThings I don't care for\n\n- Sound/music, it's just "meh" and I ususally turn it of and listen to radio/audiobooks instead. I don't like the dwarf voices at all.\n- Drag'n'drop equipment to dwarfs get's old quick. Especially when you have 12 dwarfs ind your castle.\n- Why do we have to build everything to unlock the recipe-tree?

Building the first shelter and surviving the first major waves is surprisingly challenging, but it's great fun delving into the crafting game.  The dwarves sometimes do have spotty AI, and it can be hard and a bit frustrating trying to keep them alive near water or big enemies.  However, the player can directly control a dwarf and play it Terriria-style.  Looking for treasures underground or battle enemies in that mode is a lot more reliable and fun.\n\nThe game is not without faults, but the charm makes it hard to put down once you start.

All three worlds are in and changes are still being made for the better. The graphics are being improved with every patch, and the game feels fulland complete, with each patch just being a cherry on top. With the way the game is now, you can probably get 25 or so hours in a single playthrough, but it is fun to do multiple playthroughs. Worth the money for sure.\n\nThis game still has a lot of flaws, given that it is in alpha, but it is incredibly fun non the less. If this game or games in this genre interest you, pick it up while it is cheap, because it is worth it, and only going to get better with more patches. This really does feel like a complete game, just with a few problems, so If you are willing to put up with it (or get it cheap now and wait for more patches so you don't have to pay more when the game is fully released) get it. Worth all of the $15, and even more than that.\nEdit:\nIn the two weeks since I bought this game nearly all of the issues I had with it have been fixed.

Repeat every 10-15 seconds depending on armor equipped).\nSatisfying gaining, building and then using tech. (elevators, mine trucks, lightning towers)\nNot satisfying realising the tech is pretty obselete with the spells you have...

Well, to start off it is one I recommend whole-heartedly. I enjoy playing CTW a lot. It seems to have the potential to be boring, dig stuff up, find the secret rooms, kill the boss, move on to next level. But it is not boring at all.\n\nSo, the story is that you have a dwarf who doesn't even have an axe. Yep, a dwarf without an axe. Mad I say; everyone knows dwarves are born kicking and screaming, beard and all, with axe in hand. Salt and pepper, coffee and cream, mac and cheese, dwarf and axe. Still you have the potential to sort this out pretty soon. Dig up some stone with your little stone knife, cut down a couple of trees and you get to build an axe. Or a pick axe. Or both. But by now, you probably have another dwarf, sans axe of course, and have to kit him out too.\n\nBut of course, a stone axe just won't cut it will it? (Sorry, pun intended) You want to move up to iron, steel, silver and eventually to mithril. For all your dwarves. This takes time and patience but it is worth it.\n\nThe campaign starts you off in a nice little forest world. Beat this then you move on to an ice world without anything you had before you moved over. But of course you don't move all your team across, just one and you start all over again, this time on a harder world. But you are not done when you finish this world. Desert world is next. Now, the latest update has arrived and, lo, a new world has been added. Underground! With a whole new set of creatures and bad guys to take on and some kind of underground God thing who likes you to leave stuff for it on an altar and if it likes the stuff it will give you useful stuff. I haven't beaten this world yet, only just started it so i can't tell you what happens but all in all a nice addition.\n\nSo, get digging / chopping / fishing / smithing and all the other things you need to do to beat this game. I enjoy it and hopefully you will too!","May 23, 2015","true","292.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you never liked DF's end game, onyl the struggle to it, this game is perfect. There's no end-game economy, just a slow climb to reach the next level.\n\nThe game is mostly you sending dwarves to harvest resouce X or attack enemy Y. That's all you can do with them, though you can directly control one at a time (this is VERY inefficient). To aid their escapades, you can craft items (or queue them, if they require skilled dwarvish labour) and equip them or place traps and defences. Or use spells, like portals, to speed up their activities.\nMining, as with all dwarvish games, is a big part.\n\nAs you accumulate minerals, food and furniture, you are sometimes assaulted in a heavy siege, or find a loot-riddled dungeon. Ultimately, you wish to gather the plans for a portal and get out of there; it's never safe for long as sieges become stronger and fiercer.\n\nCertainly, it's a simple game. It's not DF compelxcity, but if you just want a simple, slow game that goes perfect with a nice podcast or video, this is great for those! For 19 euros, you get a pretty solid game, with plenty of length and exploring to do.","July 3, 2015","true","115.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The big drive for leveling up is getting that extra dwarf at each level to add to your army, but it never feels like you have enough dwarves.  I wish the game gave you more of them to work with as a whole, I feel like the huge buildings I create could/should house a whole legion of dwarves but I'm instead restricted to the 13 I have at level 13\n-Fighting often feels anti-climactic, you'll either easily mow down most enemies or get slaughtered by the larger ones (at least until you advance your craft far enough to make better stuff or have more dwarves from leveling up)  There isn't much strategy behind the combat other than making sure you have enough dwarves in an area to swarm the undead during invasions\n-Crafting is tedious, the game requires you to put ingredients(click and drag) into slots even though all craftable item recipes are learned from advancing your crafting skill tree.  It only adds a few seconds to gameplay, but having to do it each time you learn a new recipe adds up. (Especially since the game pauses whenever you go into the crafting menu.)\n-Moving to a new world causes you to lose all of your research progress.  This is a huge frustration when the portals keep spawning harder and harder monsters and you're struggling to catch up.\n\nOverall\nThe game offers a lot of gameplay and replayability, especially in the beginning.  And although it may start to feel like a grind later on, you'll still get many solid hours of fun gameplay out of this title.  For the price, it's worth checking out. (And to support the devs in hope they take this system and refine it.)  If you would like more information about this game, I've created some videos showing gameplay...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBdcQcppiq0\n\n*Update - So I've gotten to the point where I don't really want to play this game anymore due to the repetative nature.  I'm going to keep the reccomendation just because I easily got my money's worth out of the game, but you may be disappointed by the repetative nature of the late game.  The developer really should have added more unique content to the later levels.","June 8, 2015","true","100.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The big drive for leveling up is getting that extra dwarf at each level to add to your army, but it never feels like you have enough dwarves.  I wish the game gave you more of them to work with as a whole, I feel like the huge buildings I create could/should house a whole legion of dwarves but I'm instead restricted to the 13 I have at level 13\n-Fighting often feels anti-climactic, you'll either easily mow down most enemies or get slaughtered by the larger ones (at least until you advance your craft far enough to make better stuff or have more dwarves from leveling up)  There isn't much strategy behind the combat other than making sure you have enough dwarves in an area to swarm the undead during invasions\n-Crafting is tedious, the game requires you to put ingredients(click and drag) into slots even though all craftable item recipes are learned from advancing your crafting skill tree.  It only adds a few seconds to gameplay, but having to do it each time you learn a new recipe adds up. (Especially since the game pauses whenever you go into the crafting menu.)\n-Moving to a new world causes you to lose all of your research progress.  This is a huge frustration when the portals keep spawning harder and harder monsters and you're struggling to catch up.\n\nOverall\nThe game offers a lot of gameplay and replayability, especially in the beginning.  And although it may start to feel like a grind later on, you'll still get many solid hours of fun gameplay out of this title.  For the price, it's worth checking out. (And to support the devs in hope they take this system and refine it.)  If you would like more information about this game, I've created some videos showing gameplay...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBdcQcppiq0\n\n*Update - So I've gotten to the point where I don't really want to play this game anymore due to the repetative nature.  I'm going to keep the reccomendation just because I easily got my money's worth out of the game, but you may be disappointed by the repetative nature of the late game.  The developer really should have added more unique content to the later levels.","June 8, 2015","true","100.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Love this game!  You take charge of a growing squad of dwarves, and give them tasks as needed, in order to make the world a nice place for a clan of dwarves to settle.  But enemies will also come for your kingdom, so take the time to prepare.  You can either just give orders and sit back, or you can get your own hands dirty by taking control of any individual dwarf for certain tasks.\n\nThe game has a lot of replay value.  The first campaign, at a fairly normal pace but trying to explore most of the world, took about 25 to 30 hours.  Graphics are simple and cutesy, but still quite pretty and functional for what the game is trying to do.  The crafting tree is robust, with a lot of functional and cosmetic items.  Though, even cosmetic items are functional in a way, given how the dwarves' resting mechanic works.\n\nThe only real drawback to this game comes when you gather quite the party of dwarves (over 10).  Then, the dwarven AI individually tends to compete, and they start to derp in frustrating ways.  You'll see 2 or 3 dwarves competing for a single task and getting waylaid on the other side of portals if you don't micromanage certain tasks.  Too, sometimes dwarves will fail their tasks for no apparent reason, or plain not recognize their task.  Fortunately, you can (usually) clear this problem by taking control of a dwarf and/or immediately releasing him.\n\nAll in all, the game is fully worth the $20 it was at regular price.  If you catch it on a Steam sale, you'll do even better.  For lovers of simpler real-time strategy, with mining/crafting elements, building, and some battling!","June 10, 2015","true","96.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Any and everything you gather is stored in the stockpile, and needs to be defended by your dwarves. Especially at night, when undeads walk the lands. In set intervals a portal will open and release a horde of enemies walking towards your stockpile, much larger than the few undeads during normal nights.\n\nAs you gather ressources you can build a house around the stockpile with several floors, offensive towers and many, many items to fill it up. Several crafting stations produce different types of items, from food over equipment to more complex devices. Over time you will get more dwarves under control, which do all the work for you: mining, chopping trees, hunting animals, farming, killing monsters and generally keeping your base intact. They will also need to eat and sleep from time to time.\n\nMind you: food has to be placed on a table for the dwarves to access it and sleeping should be manually ordered before entering a cave in the deep or the timed monster invasions. Just to make sure everyone is at maximum health. If one of your dwarves dies he is gone forever. A new dwarf joins you after a few minutes however. The items can be recovered, but his skills are lost.\n\nThe goal of the game is to progress through the technology tree until you can create a portal which leads you to the next world. Building it will require finding caves in the deep and disposing of its bosses, as well as gathering ressources and finding the original, destroyed portal.\n\nThe number of items to create is nigh unlimited and serves a huge amount of purposes. Even decoration items increase the comfort of your base and thus let the dwarves regenerate faster while sleeping.\n\nThe dwarves themselves can pick up to three skill lines at once (warrior, miner, swimmer, logger, ..) which can be improved through skill books. You (the player) learn several spells ranging from a simple (but very useful) town portal to more advanced ones like the fireball spell. You do have limited mana, however, which regenerates at a very slow rate.\n\nFinishing the first (easy, small) world took me over 17 hours, but I took my time with it. This should give an estimate of the other worlds, which are all larger and have a more complex topographic.\n\nAt any rate, if you enjoy more strategical, relaxed sandbox games this is strongly recommended.","June 15, 2015","true","39.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It looks good plays well and is very enjoyable the devs also continue tinkering and improving it.\n\nWhilst I consider this "lite" gaming it will challenge you at times and loves to keep the pressure on with waves of enemies coming through a portal every 40 odd minutes. It also likes to mess with my OCD side by using giant worms or dust storms to muck up my dwarf camp (the further you get into the level the less impact these events have.....if you plan right lol)\n\nI have read some other reviews and I agree the dwarfs having pathing issues........lol they are really stupid at times.....but if you really need something done you just take control of a dwarf and do it yourself. Personally I dont bother I just prioritise  the tasks I assign .....like defence first then bury them in chores. You will still have to go looking for one that gets himself stuck or built in every now and then but I just laugh and say dumb dwarfs.\n\nThe biggest tip I can give those about to play is don't get to attached to your dwarfs if you let a few die along the way for the greater good of the base you will progress faster plus they are replaced a few minutes later.","December 14, 2015","true","429.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Darf AI isn't too great either with them getting stuck or just left clueless often. Multiplayer is a true grief-fest, but what did you want? Fun to play if you can live with its flaws.\n\n----------------\n\nSo it's all about crafting a world for you dwarves. They have opened a portal which only had the power to transport 1 brave pioneer into your playfield and depend on your guidance to prosper and thrive. That is, if you can hold off the forces of evil that come out every night and every 45 minutes (the Devil sure is punctual).\n\nTo do so you need to gather resources by clicking on them. After that your eager dwarves will mine or hack away and carry the stuff back to the stockpile where it can be used to craft new items/base decorations/fortifications/food/...\n\nSadly not all dwarves are born with an Einstein level intellect so you will be wondering why 1 of them (let's call him Toby) is always doing the exact opposite of what you want. Be prepared to bail Toby out a lot with portals, scaffolding and ladders.\n\nBuilding the actual shelter is pretty basic and not too refreshing. The only real notable thing is the aura of the "Totem". The more comfort you give the dwarves, the larges their base will become. Which in turn gives you more space for more dwarves.\n\nYou get new darves by leveling up through crafting, completing tasks and combat. It somehow makes it feel too much like a mobile game by doing this, but then again every other comparable game does it... Leveling is pretty fast in the beginning but slows down incredibly after lvl 10, however the monster waves don't.\n\nSo you day to day management will be:\n\n-  gather resources\n- craft what you need for new technologies\n- give dwarves new items\n- expand base\n\nSounds like a lot of fun? Well it is in the beginning... but after a while you need to craft 100 fancy chairs just to be able to pass on to Steel armour. It makes no sense to me, uses up a lot of resources and especially slows things down dramatically. The first "easy" world will take quite a while to complete, even with cheats...\n\nAnd then there's multiplayer... for the love of God or Buddha or whoever you wish to believe in, do it with friends or alone. Chances are random players will screw you over beyond belief sending you right back to your tedious crafting without any reward whatsoever.\n\nSo all in all I want to really like the game for its ideas and just because I love the genre, but I'm stuck just barely liking it because some things can be too frustrating. If you can get it on a decent sale then don't doubt, otherwise there are better alternatives.","May 31","true","29.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is nothing more annoying than watching a dwarf repeatedly attempt to climb up a massive wall and repeatedly fall until they gradually kill themselves all for the sake of recovering a leaf that had fallen to the bottom of a long forgotten pit on the other side of the map.\n\nIn the early stages of the game this problem is hampered by wood shortages so you cannot build ladders to prevent it or food tables, beds and a shelter to even heal them back up after. In the late game this problem results in spending significant amounts of time shoring up the map to stop the little morons killing themselves doing pointless things.

Sounds like an amazing idea, but the reputation and success of those games makes for extremely large shoes to fill.  Now, while CtW is a decently fun game, it's just not deep enough to appeal to fans of the games which it is based upon.\n\nIt has the 2d construction and mining that Terraria has, but none of the different worlds are nearly as "epic" as the world made in Terraria.  Terrarra had a significant "Metroidvania" aspect in its crafting and looting that expanded the player's exploration options once they've found the right materials.  CtW tries to do this in the form of a techtree, but it just feels grindy and arbitrary compared to Terraria's more subtle systems.  The different biomes from Terraria instead exist as separate maps in CtW, making the scope of each world much smaller despite the larger number of builders.   For example, one of the funnest aspects of Terraria was that digging could get you to run into old sunken ships, mushroom worlds, and demonic fortresses.  In CtW, you get more dirt, some insects, and maybe a vampire.  The game's pace is much slower as well, which makes it feel like a slog through a shallow pit compared to Terraria.\n\nFew games can match the complexity and deepness of Dwarf Fortress, but CtW doesn't even begin to graze the surface.  Dwarves in CtW are born with innate specializations and can train and equip for more, but they can't ever be assigned specific tasks.  There is a "trader," but he's more like a regular RPG vendor and there is no diplomacy.  The challenge from DF is also unlikely to be found.  The game, with its combined slow pacing and simplicity, just doesn't have the same "losing is fun!" appeal that Dwarf Fortress does, and you have to really mess up badly to even begin to replicate experiences from that game.\n\nSo why the recommendation?  Well, I cannot pretend that any game worse than DF or Terraria is a bad game.  I had some fun playing CtW, thanks to the graphics and polish.  Making my dwarves upgrade to defend against increasingly threatening invasions was fun.  I'm just not sure who to recommend it to; fans of Dwarf Fortress will find it way too simplistic, and fans of Terraria would want a more diverse world to explore.  Maybe to people who've played neither and are interested in this sort of game, but why?  DF is free and Terraria is 1/5 the price.\n\nBottom line: Craft the World is a decently fun game but does not nearly match the epicness and complexity of the games it is based on.  Buy it on sale and don't expect to be blown away.","June 20, 2015","true","13.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

But there are just too many issues that are just irritating about this aswell.  Here are just a few points.\n\n#1 COMBAT : Getting knocked around by a starting level zombie every single time it hits a stout heavily armored dwarf in steel/Silver/MITHRIL armor. IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ . I would understand if this happened without any gear on . But its 100% all the time knock back.\n\n#2 The HOARD : The undead zerg that attacks your base every 45 minuts gets out of hand the longer you play a level making it almost impossible to enjoy the game when all you want to do is max a level before moving on . Making the game less about enjoying the core of the game and more about HURRY UP AND GET WHAT YOU NEED TO ESCAPE.\n\n#3 Combat AI : They are mentally handicapped . Having one dwarf charge into a group of 12+ mobs just because he is melee only to have him hit one mob and get juggled around due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ knockback system in the game is just beyond stupid.\n\n#4 NO SHIELDS : You can make alllllll this special gear . Auto turrets (that barely work) LIGHTNING TOWERS , TRAPS  but you CAN"T strap some wood together and make a SHIELD....... that logic .\n\n#5 Can't SELL : I don't know but the idea that you can only buy stuff from a store ....... kind of stupid also . I guess the devs never heard of a bartering system . Later on you ammount masses of USELESS items ......that just sit there .\n\n#6 Crafting Tree : The crafting tree is ok , but it lacks a lot of common sense . As some of the most BASIC ideas such as burning wood to make coal and farming for example are among some of the highest tier crafts .\n\nAll in all the game needs a decent ammount of work and balancing at this time . So it's not worth the price for the overall aggrivation it causes .","May 30","false","35.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Hopefully, my 90+ hours of play time will show that! I really enjoy commanding dwarves to carve out through the depths of the underground. After I first bought the game, my first reactions were "This looks so very nice!", "Wait... There are only  three  worlds?" and "Holy crap this tech tree!" After my first 5+ hours I started to understand the games mechanics. Really easy to download and play, plus there is a tutorial, that is skippable when you start a new world. Now the problems I have with the game. Right around the middle of the tech tree, I find myself having to grind along. Most of that is because of a need for wool. The developers remedied this by adding traps and farms to maintain sheep. Unfortunately, both the farm fences and the trap require rope, which is made with wool, to make. Also, the AI for the dwarves still needs a little work. Often they will not pick up the resources I need and instead gather around tables for chats. That being said, the AI is not bad by any means. Recently there was an update that did help fix this. I have had a problems with occasional minor lag spikes and my saves corrupting if my computer bluescreens, which is not the developers fault.

Hopefully, my 90+ hours of play time will show that! I really enjoy commanding dwarves to carve out through the depths of the underground. After I first bought the game, my first reactions were "This looks so very nice!", "Wait... There are only  three  worlds?" and "Holy crap this tech tree!" After my first 5+ hours I started to understand the games mechanics. Really easy to download and play, plus there is a tutorial, that is skippable when you start a new world. Now the problems I have with the game. Right around the middle of the tech tree, I find myself having to grind along. Most of that is because of a need for wool. The developers remedied this by adding traps and farms to maintain sheep. Unfortunately, both the farm fences and the trap require rope, which is made with wool, to make. Also, the AI for the dwarves still needs a little work. Often they will not pick up the resources I need and instead gather around tables for chats. That being said, the AI is not bad by any means. Recently there was an update that did help fix this. I have had a problems with occasional minor lag spikes and my saves corrupting if my computer bluescreens, which is not the developers fault. The fault lies with GeForce producing terrible cards ( and Nvidia producing updated ♥♥♥♥ drivers for older cards. Definitely worth $20. I would buy it again at that price, and an even better value if bought cheaper.\n\nPros:\n-The games art style\n-Large tech tree\n-Large maps\n-Personally control one dwarf at a time\n-Wide spectrum of enemies\n\nCons:\n-Grind, grind, grind\n-minor lag spikes\n\nBottom line:\nI would definitely buy this again and I would completely recommend this game for any of my friends.","March 10, 2015","true","141.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Instead of directly modifying it as in other games, you only indicate what needs to be done, and the dwarfs take care of the rest. It is fun to watch the clumsy dwarfs doing their job. Digging underground tunnels, building bridges, houses, and defensive walls. You need to explore the world to find needed resources. You start with cutting trees, but soon create long underground tunnels in search for rare minerals. You can help your dwarfs by equipping them with better tools, weapons and armor. From time to time, you get attacked by an army of skeletons and monsters. It creates the feeling of urgency, keeping you motivated to keep exploring and improving your defenses. One of your first tasks will be to build a shelter, a place where your dwarfs can replenish their energy, and defend against monsters. This 'world' part of the game is fantastic: 10/10.\n\nLets continue with the bad:\n\nIn order to progress in the game you will need to craft items. This is where the fun gets replaced by boring, and tiresome activity.\nIn order to craft an item, you first have to display the crafting interface. This will show you a 3x3 grid where you have to place the components and click 'Craft' to finish. Each component needs to be individually placed in the grid, by dragging it from its location in the inventory. The inventory has a number of tabs, and an additional click is required to find the component.\nThis tedious process brings absolutely nothing to the game. It is boring, interrupts the game flow (the game stops during crafting), and it feels more like work than play. It is extremely annoying when playing on the laptop with just a touchpad.\n\nA click-fest as another reviewer called it. I will call it a carpal-syndrome simulator. For example to craft a Bucket (a rather simple item) you need to click your mouse button 12 times (4 times drag-drop). And you will be doing it a lot. Every item in the game needs to be crafted, and in order to progress through the crafting tree, you will be even crafting items you don't need. The 'crafting' part of the game is simply not fun: 0/10.\n\nUnfortunately I can't recommend the game in the current state. Not with the boring drag-drop spreadsheet you will be forced to deal with half the time.  While still in the 'Early Access' state, the game has enormous potential, but I recommend waiting before buying it. Keep it in your wishlist instead.","September 22, 2014","false","41.0"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","10","20","0","2"

Now I have your attention.\n\nAs far as God-simulators go, this game is pretty awesome.  The game has a surprising amount of depth and a creative sandbox mode once you complete the 3 level campaign which adds to the fun.  The campaign consists of 3 levels: first is a small forest setting, the second is a medium sized snow setting, and the last is a large desert, each getting more difficult to pass.  Don't be fooled by the few levels though, each one has taken me upwards of 10 hours each to finish.\n\nOver the course of a game, you have to start with nothing much like other creation games such as Minecraft, and build your way up from nothing by gathering everything from dirty to iron, gold, and eventually Mithril.  Using these gathered resources, you traverse a large tech tree, each category allowing you to build more items ranging from decoration for your home to weapons and armor.\n\nThe game will pique your interest quick and hold your attention for a long time.  With that said, once you beat the campaign and do a sandbox mode or two, you start to notice and exploit things like how to efficiently mine, find gold or skill books, and how to cheese the invading zombies (I will not reveal that here.)  Once this happens, you (or at least I did) will get bored quickly.  The novelty for me wore off literally halfway through a game one day, and I just quit.\n\nThe Good:\n\n1-Great crafting system\n2-Challenging combat (not at first, but the longer you stay in game, the more enemies come out to ransack you)\n3-very fun spellunking system\n4-hours upon hours of fun per level\n5-quests give you both direction and reward\n\nThe Bad:\n1-Once you've discovered combat and mining exploits, the game loses most of its fun and challenge\n2-Even the largest maps are pretty small, taking maybe only 25% more time to finish than the smallest\n3-Enemy waves happen only once every 50 minutes (25 minutes if you have the game speed set to 2x)\n4-weapon and armor improvements are WAY down the tech tree, so you have inferior gear against large waves if you dont move fast\n\nAll in all, the game is a great way to burn a lot of hours, especially for how cheap it is.  being under $20 means that as long as you enjoy it for at least 10 hours, it was well worth it, and I promise you will get a lot more than that out of it.","February 1, 2015","true","102.4"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","48","14","29","18","0"

Sometimes it pays off and you get hours of fun out of it, sometimes you are dealt a bad hand. This time was the latter for me. As much as I want to like this game, it suffers from a tremendously bad UI that is clunky and not very intuitive. I had to keep replaying the tutorial because I simply couldn't wrap my head around the UI. I feel like it has a steeper learning curve than the game itself. Browsing the forums, I see others have had the same complaint and have requested everything from minor changes to a complete overhaul of the UI, and the developer's response has basically been “deal with it”. So the only hope would be for a UI mod developed by a third party. Maybe if/when that happens, I will revisit this game, but for now, it has been uninstalled and moved into my “Bad Games” category.","June 12, 2015","false","4.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pinkfae/recommended/248390/","pinkfae","PinkFae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pinkfae/","239 products in account","Craft the World is a very fun and addicting simulation game. You start off the game with one dwarf, a storage location and a shop to buy things. There is also technology tree where you have to complete a number of items crafted to reach the next tier. You use your dwarf to locate the items required, which could be a plant, an animal or a mineral. When you start crafting you will gain experience points to reach the next level. At each new level you gain one new dwarf to help with your city.\n\nThe game does have a day and night rotation. During the night zombies, skeletons and other foul beasts will show up in an attempt to destroy your creation. When you slay them you will get some experience points and they will drop some loot. There will also be goblins that try to move in randomly during the day.\n\nThe interface is very easy to use. You can drag the items you crafted into a tool bar, click it again to select it and then place them on the map. The crafting is done by dragging items into one of nine boxes. Depending on what item you place in which box you'll create an item. This might seem cumbersome at first, but the first time you make a mistake and discover an item you don't have the instructions for, you'll be happy it was made that way.\n\nI played the game at an easy setting to get use to it and have some fun. There are ways to make it more challenging. I set it so that when a dwarf dies he later respawns, but you can set it so that it is a permanent death.\n\nIf you are into simulaiton games where you get to build homes, this is the game for you.","November 27, 2014","true","47.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Craft The World is by far the most addictive game I've come across since Plants vs Zombies (1), Field Runners and Prison Architect.  I woke up one morning, played all day and night around the clock till 6am.  That's how addictive this game is.  The whole minecraft, side scroller/builder is awesome.  I never thought something like this would be so much fun.  Albeit it needs more updates with bugs and a few new ideas; this game is amazing.  I can't say much about it.  For $10, it's a damn steal.  You must try this game without asking questions.\n\nRemember, Cash shop is not pay to win, to gather water you need buckets in your inventory and just click on the water and choose gather or fish.

The only theoretical threat comes from night-time hordes of monsters, but that's a farce. Assuming they successfully breach your defenses, they just stand there in the main hall, waiting for morning to come (at which time they burn to ashes like vampires), while all your critically injured dwarves sleep and heal somewhere else.\n\n*The crafting system for Craft The World is a textbook example of a developer ripping a system off from another game without actually understanding its point. In Minecraft, you get a 9 square grid where you can place ingredients because you are meant to actually guess and experiment with recipes. In Craft the World, the recipes are *given to you* as you advance down a tech tree, but the game still expects you to laboriously drag ingredient by ingredient to the grid every time you want to craft something. Why can't I just select the item and quantity I want and be done about it???\n\n*Most techs range from mildly useful to entirely cosmetical, but you are still required to craft several items from each to unlock the next, which results in a lumbering grind.\n\n*There are no female dwarves and population does not increase the way... one would expect. Instead, new dwarves magically teleport in when you reach tech tree milestones. There's no demographical simulation at all; this ain't no Dwarf Fortress.\n\n*You have to manually reposition all traps after every night-time invasion attempt by the undead horde. But as I said, you might not even bother, as nothing of consequence actually happens if they get through.\n\n*The sound effects are exaggerated, repetitive and get on your nerves. From non-stop loud snoring to the cheesiest battlecries, your ears don't get 10 seconds of respite.","July 27, 2015","false","15.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Why is this review negative?\nI got roped in, I got sucker-punched with the all too psychologically powerful allure of mobile-game design.\nI understand that phrase is considered an ill one in the gaming community, it smacks of tedium, tasks drawn out to the most painful extent possible, and constant, tiny, new goals that move you a modicum forward for dozens of minutes of effort.\n\nThat's really what it is. I mean, what's here is done fairly well.\n\nYour dwarves are automated little cretins with terrible AI who go out, collect resources that you assign them to collect, build what you want them to build, and come back to sleep in their shelter when their health is low, or eat food after they've exerted themselves and built up some of them good old munchies. The game works, it's relatively bug free (I had one crash, and sometimes dwarves get stuck trying to get out of water, that's about it), the mechanics are fluid, and the game is generally competent. Whoopee.\nAt first it's impossibly addictive. This game is deceptively simple, and what I mean by that is that there's a great illusion here of this game having a lot to it at first, you look at the fairly large tech tree, the needs and behaviors of your dwarves, the monster waves with the promise of "tower defense" style strategy, and mechanics like farms and being able to husband animals in them.\n\nIt's fairly cool at first look, but everything here is surface level. There's very little automation of tasks, you can't instruct your dwarves to automatically sheer sheep, or plant, harvest, and replant wheat, or automatically build and rebuild structures. I'm kind of stretching here, but with games of this type, I expect a certain amount of ease of use features to make it more fluid to play, but like I said, this is a mobile-style game, meaning they WANT you to perform as many actions as possible to drag out the playtime.\nThat basically means doing every little simple thing takes a very large amount of button presses, if you want to craft something, you first have to manually arrange the recipe yourself, then craft it, then drag it to a hot bar, then place it, then wait for your dwarves to put it down, after they've dropped it off at the stockpile, then picked it up, and finally gotten on their way.\n\nIt's that kind of maddening tedium that somehow becomes addictive for a brief period of time, and in my tiredness and desire for something completely mindless to distract me it did its job, but when I finally finished the first level, I felt a profound sense of disappointment and a total lack of feeling of accomplishment when the endgame portal appeared with a ludicrous green "EXIT" sign above it.\n\nThere's not much to get out of this game, moment to moment it will suck the minutes away from you as you fiddle away with its time wasting mechanics, but the game isn't difficult, it doesn't require much thought, the combat is mindless and so is defending yourself against the hordes of enemies that appear. I felt tired after playing this game (yes I know I spent an insane amount of time in single sittings on it).\nHonestly I really don't know what was going through my head, it must have been my profoundly apathetic mood at the time, but somehow I slogged through this game twice a year apart.\n\nI'm still completely confounded by it. My soul drifts through the aether looking for answers it will never have.\nI don't recommend this game. If you want to waste your time go play Skyrim or something, or hell, play Dungeon Keeper or Terreria or anything that has an actual sense of accomplishment.","June 5","false","23.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(And yes, this is using the "quick craft" system.)\nIt is hard to manage once the tunnel system gets large.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/knetic/recommended/248390/","knetic","K!netic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/knetic/","300 products in account","tl;dr Buy it, you'll have fun. But don't expect to love it forever.\n\nLet's cut to it - it's not as interactive as it looks. You set commands ("cut down that tree", "mine that shaft", "place that item", "gather water", "plant wheat here", etc) on blocks. The dwarves then decide which tasks they want to do, and when. Each dwarf can only do one task at a time, and you don't get to control the priority of tasks (though combat orders always seem to be the most important). This means that if you wind up setting up orders for a new tunnel, a logging operation, planting a new crop, and building the house, the dwarves will do it in whatever order they want. You can't decide the order. One of your dozen dwarves (it's hard to get more than 12 dwarves) will get around to it eventually.\n\nAnd for much of the game, that's fine, and you won't complain. But as others have noted, endgame it becomes a chore. Dwarves need to input/output items into the central (immovable) stockpile for practically every task, and they wind up traversing huge distances to do so. This becomes a huge bottleneck, and wastes obscene amounts of time. You'd think that one dwarf could cut a tunnel while others removed the stone behind him; but nope. One dwarf cuts as much stone as he can hold, then makes a full trip back to home to drop it off, then comes back. If you order a dwarf to patch a hole in the wall with dirt, dwarves that are currently HOLDING DIRT will just pass right by the wall, and one specific dwarf will grab dirt from the stockpile, then patch the wall with it.\n\nThis is especially stupid because you can't move stockpiles, nor can you create stockpiles for a *very long time*. If you're playing tech tree mode, it's literally the second-to-last thing you unlock (~12ish hours of gameplay). If you're playing sandbox, it's all luck which things you unlock, but you still won't have the ability to build a stockpile for many hours - if you get it at all.\n\nThere's the option to use railroads, but they're expensive (they take a lot of iron to traverse a Large map), and like stockpiles, aren't unlocked until late in the game.\n\nThe fix for this is to use portals. You drop a portal from your stockpile to wherever you want your dwarves to work, it drastically shortens the trip time, and they prefer tasks near the portal. But that's a terrible solution, in my mind. It shortcuts the whole idea of "building" and having good task scheduling, and instead makes it so that you micromanage portals instead of dwarves.\n\nUltimately, it's fun for a good amount of hours. But it doesn't increase in depth or complexity, and becomes a grind to unlock things that you don't even want by the time you get them.","December 23, 2014","true","23.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Craft The World seemed to do just that, and once I started playing I found myself sucked in and spending long hours immersed, at least until I completed the first world.\n\nThe game is very enjoyable to play, easy and intuitive to learn. It’s fun to command around your army of cute little dumb dwarfs. And dumb they are, sometimes amusing you with their complete goofiness and sometimes testing your patience to the limit, as they so often seem to refuse collaboration. They have a persistent tendency of being in the wrong place. Command your dwarfs to build something, and you can be sure all other idle dwarfs will run to that same spot and stand there doing nothing, just hampering the dwarf who is actually trying to do the building. Relax your attention for a moment, and the dwarves may wander off getting lost into caves or falling down to their deaths into pits full of critters.\n\nAll this fun will last you through the first world though, as you will have to start from scratch once you beat the first world and start the second one. All the long hours you spent grinding through the tech tree, collecting resources, upgrading and training your dwarfs will all be lost once you make it through the portal to the next world.\n\nThis is a major drawback of this game, as it gives you little reason to keep on playing after the first world. It’s frustrating to have to start over, and not being able to keep your dwarves and tech upgrades. I don’t mind arriving at a new world to build and explore, but starting everything all over from point zero with one dwarf and no tech was enough for me to put the game down for good.\n\nAnother part of the game mechanics that makes little sense is the huge tech tree you have to work through in order to get access to better equipment. Many of the items you are forced to craft in order to advance are completely useless (mirrors, decorative items, columns, statues, gargoyles...). These useless items should not be mandatory.\n\nIt would also be nice to be able to assign individual tasks to a dwarf or group of dwarves, as the current game only allows tasks to be assigned collectively. This task assignment is not always efficient – sometimes a dwarf standing right next to a assigned task will do nothing while another dwarf will come from far away to complete that task.\n\nI can say without any doubt that I enjoyed playing this game and that the 30 hours+ spent to finish the first world were worth the money I paid for it, but I wish there had been a way to continue the game without losing everything I conquered.\n\nMaybe the developers will correct these issues in a future update, as it has been a major source of complaint among players.\n","December 22, 2014","true","116.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/knetic/recommended/248390/","knetic","K!netic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/knetic/","300 products in account","tl;dr Buy it, you'll have fun. But don't expect to love it forever.\n\nLet's cut to it - it's not as interactive as it looks. You set commands ("cut down that tree", "mine that shaft", "place that item", "gather water", "plant wheat here", etc) on blocks. The dwarves then decide which tasks they want to do, and when. Each dwarf can only do one task at a time, and you don't get to control the priority of tasks (though combat orders always seem to be the most important). This means that if you wind up setting up orders for a new tunnel, a logging operation, planting a new crop, and building the house, the dwarves will do it in whatever order they want. You can't decide the order. One of your dozen dwarves (it's hard to get more than 12 dwarves) will get around to it eventually.\n\nAnd for much of the game, that's fine, and you won't complain. But as others have noted, endgame it becomes a chore. Dwarves need to input/output items into the central (immovable) stockpile for practically every task, and they wind up traversing huge distances to do so. This becomes a huge bottleneck, and wastes obscene amounts of time. You'd think that one dwarf could cut a tunnel while others removed the stone behind him; but nope. One dwarf cuts as much stone as he can hold, then makes a full trip back to home to drop it off, then comes back. If you order a dwarf to patch a hole in the wall with dirt, dwarves that are currently HOLDING DIRT will just pass right by the wall, and one specific dwarf will grab dirt from the stockpile, then patch the wall with it.\n\nThis is especially stupid because you can't move stockpiles, nor can you create stockpiles for a *very long time*. If you're playing tech tree mode, it's literally the second-to-last thing you unlock (~12ish hours of gameplay). If you're playing sandbox, it's all luck which things you unlock, but you still won't have the ability to build a stockpile for many hours - if you get it at all.\n\nThere's the option to use railroads, but they're expensive (they take a lot of iron to traverse a Large map), and like stockpiles, aren't unlocked until late in the game.\n\nThe fix for this is to use portals. You drop a portal from your stockpile to wherever you want your dwarves to work, it drastically shortens the trip time, and they prefer tasks near the portal. But that's a terrible solution, in my mind. It shortcuts the whole idea of "building" and having good task scheduling, and instead makes it so that you micromanage portals instead of dwarves.\n\nUltimately, it's fun for a good amount of hours. But it doesn't increase in depth or complexity, and becomes a grind to unlock things that you don't even want by the time you get them.","December 23, 2014","true","23.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I won't go into great detail as others already have but I must say that I find the game challenging and entertaining. After the first world I feel like the challenge really ramps up. As others have stated before, Even midway through the first world will become increasingly more difficult as you struggle for resources. A HUGE help is I discovered you can put items in the crafting window to break them down for some components back and I feel not pointing this out in an extremely obvious fashion is a major oversight. Breaking down old equipment is very helpful but I do hope the developers make it so ALL crafted items can be broken down for base components.\n\nAlso if the developers can add more content for the other worlds that would be a large incentive to play them as the first world can be difficult enough and the rest just get harder. With no new unlockables for the later stages it feels like I should just keep replaying the first level. PLEASE ADD MORE CONTENT!!!! Maybe add rare equipment like boots of speed, backpack of holding, flaming sword of doom, etc?","December 10, 2014","true","39.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Instead of being a single person digging holes and exploring, you start out with one dwarf who carries out simple tasks like chopping down trees, collecting food, mining, etc. You get more dwarves as the game progresses and you level up. You gain experience from every little action you take but the majority of it will come from fighting. Every night, monsters come out and will try to kill off your dwarves. It's usually not very threatening but there's a constant countdown for a huge wave of monsters that gets bigger and more dangerous as time progresses so you have to make sure you're working towards better gear and shelter fast enough to survive. This is where the tower defense mechanic comes into play. You can build traps and other obstacles to either thin out the herd or slow them down while your dwarves attack from safety. You win by exploring the depths of the land and fighting the "bosses" for portal keys. Once you've collected the portal keys, you can complete the level at your leisure.\n\nOther than the story missions, you can also set up custom games and that's pretty much all I do now. You choose the size of the map, the weather frequency, the difficulty, and the biome. You can choose from either a forest, snow, or desert area and each one plays radically different. The forest is the easiest one with lots of trees and other vegetation. The snow area is a bit more difficult because you have to melt ice to gain water and snowfall can make the terrain a bit harder to traverse if you don't clear it out frequently. Finally, the desert is the hardest of them all with less trees and berries than the other maps and the constant threat of sandstorms grabbing dwarves and scattering around items.\n\nIn short, it's a very fun crafting game that does some things a little differently while still keeping the basic jist of other crafting games.","December 1, 2014","true","79.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In icy world, one cannot find lake for fishing, a skill needed to progress in technology.

I just "beat" the game in sandbox mode - assembled the broken portal - and VOILA! There's an update that changes the look and feel of the whole game! BAM! Thank you! I am so excited to play again! And on a different terrain this time! Maybe campaign? Who knows? But I love the look and feel of this game. It's a little slower paced than some of the other dwarf/gnome/halfling/etc. sandbox builder game, but you have less people, too. You need to plan out your building strategy a little - no selecting large areas and sitting back to let them go. You will have quite the wait. And make sure you have a portal spell ready or you will be wondering why your force seems to dwindle as they get stuck down below mining with a huge long trek back. The AI is a little funky, but you can work around it without much difficulty. And the dwarves climb the walls!!! Yay! It can be hazardous if they fall, but it means they get stuck less often due to lack of ladders or scaffolding. I like the animations - the workshops and such when they are being used. All-in-all, I'm looking forward to each update and am very impressed with how well the devs listen to the players.

The game was fun back then, but it clearly needed a lot more work put into it, so I left it for a while and decided to come back to it once it had been updated a bit.\n\nAlmost a year on, I decided to give the game another blast and see what had changed. The answer to that was, not a lot!\n\nIt's a very slow paced game where you need to craft various items from basic house furnishings, to weapons and equipment. The recipes need more and more materials to create them, so you need to venture deep into the earth and explore the wild around you to find them. The problem is, this slow pace is almost halted to a crawl as the AI of the dwarves is absurd!\n\nThe dwarves often stand there "path finding" when they are stood in the middle of an open area, with nothing around them which could be considered an obstacle. Often even a simple jump takes 20 seconds of calculations to work out how to do it.\n\nI revealed an area with some pretty tough monsters in it. A guardian whom can summon skeletons and is only vulnerable to mithril (which will take you some time to research due to the afore mentioned problems). After realising he was too tough, I cancelled my command to attack him and wanted my dwarves to go back to what they were doing. The problem was, once I had cancelled the command, this did NOTHING to stop my dwarves repeatedly running and trying to attack the Guardian. Even using the "call to fortress" feature was useless as that would cause them to stay in one place and do nothing, then once I cancelled this order, they would run straight back to the Guardian to try and kill him!\n\nIn the end my dwarf I had skilled up to be my main warrior was killed due to his own (and the games) stupidity. After this, I decided that the time and effort I put into getting to where I did had been wasted.\n\nI would not reccommend this game unless the developers revamped the entire AI system and made the game actually playable. Until then, it's not worth £14! I would pay maybe £3 for this game, but would much rather see it offered as a flash game on some website for free!","October 30, 2015","false","33.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are so many more features in this game than they let me know of!  The game seems to intelligently progress in difficulty and is constantly keeping me on my toes, but not ruining the experience.  This game is like Lemmings and Terraria put together.  I like Dwarf Fortress, but we can't compare apples to oranges, folks.\n\nThe fun is in the unique management that you have to endure.  There is no number crunching of taxes or balancing of peasant population to that of the warriors...  The management is in the making sure your work gets done before nightfall, keep your dwarves fed, provide a safe work environment (yes, they can slip, trip, drown, and fall to their deaths), provide shelter, and then get to your exploring.\n\nTo top it off, the game is visually enjoyable.  It is asthetically color balanced and the animations are reminicent of Monty Python's cartoon shorts.\n\nI love it!","December 22, 2013","true","131.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The crafting system is especially well made and is probably the highlight. I've seen some people say its hard to control the Dwarfs and it is and isn't at the same time. Early game its easy to get your dwarfs moving in one direction. Late game once you get vast chasms of mines and tunnels you'll be tearing your hair out when goblins suddenly spawn next to your house while all your dwarfs but 2 or 3 are away in the tunnels. There are some useful presets you can give to your dwarfs to perform certain jobs, the lite RPG elements are neat and give serious benefits to highly leveld dwarfs for their jobs but it becomes damn near impossible to keep track of everything and keep all your dwarfs on the same page after your population hits 20 or 30.\n\nThe crafting is neat. You start you gathering resources and clearing tunnels and land. You develop a nice plot to place a house on and keep your dwarfs slept and fed and then you go from there progressively upgrading and improving your tools, armor, weapons and workbenches. The crafting system has a fairly deep system but it still didn't seem deep enough to keep me interested late game. After so long it became more of a stalemate and i couldn't keep up nor could i dig far enough and build enough ladders to get to the best ores. At this point i lost interest since i was more or less in a slogging grind and was making little to no progress. To some that may be part of the fun, and it is for me usually, but the crafting system wasn't deep enough to keep me grinding. Since crafting is one of the main, if not the main, selling points of this game that can be a hit or miss depending on who you are or what you like. I'd recommend it to people who can get this game on the cheap and enjoy cartoony games with lots of charm and a neat little twist on the craft/survive genre.\n\nIts got a bit of Minecraft, Terraria and a bit of RTS-RPG like Warcraft 3. It has good charm from your dwarfs and some of the enemies you battle. It has vibrant colors with clean, well made graphics that fit the atmosphere and gameplay perfectly. And finally the sound design and quality are pretty top notch for an indie game or Mobile port (not sure if this is a mobile port but it seems like one).\n\nPros\n-Vibrant Colors and Graphics. Very clean and pretty.\n-Nice sounds and music. Helps keep the charm of the game up during play.\n-Charm. This game has a good amount of charm, atleast to me.\n-RPG elements. It has several layers and types of RPG elements\n-Crafting system. Its fairly easy to understand, a bit convoluted but has decent depth.\n-RTS elements with individual characters having their own equipment slots.\n-Many different jobs and noticable changes to productivity from job skills leveling up.\n\nCons\n-Turns into a grind late game.\n-Crafting system wasn't deep enough to keep me interested late game or long term.\n-Some enemies seem very annoying, the goblins especially.\n-The game is good in many different facets but doesn't really excell at any one in specific.\n-Somewhat convoluted design to mages and some crafting recipes.\n-A slight learning curve, especially for those new to the genre.\n-Some of the items and furniture seem useless and arbitrary.\n\nThats about it. Its good little game. I feel it was worth the price. I think i payed $7.50 or $10 for it and i got a nice, enjoyable 10 hours out of it. I'll probably come back a few months down the line to give it another play through because the game does have a lot of charm to me despite its flaws. Its a, for the most part, technically solid game that was better than i'd expected. I think it deserves a buy if you're into Terraria/Starcraft, Minecraft and other games of that ilk. I wouldn't reccomend it on its RPG-RTS elements alone but they blend together well with the survival/craft elements to make a rather enjoyable and worthwhile game, even if its worth wasn't that long for this one guy.","January 15, 2015","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdjuice32/recommended/248390/","nerdjuice32","nerdjuice32","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdjuice32/","63 products in account","This game has me quite torn. It has so much potential to be a really awesome game but just a few things hold it back, I think.\n\nI really like the base mechanics of the game. You don't control your people individually, but rather tell them what to do and they'll get to it eventually. This can lead to annoyance as things can become high priority to you and your people continue to do the other 'housekeeping' tasks you've set. I could be wrong, but as far as I know, there's no way to increase priority of tasks. That's definitely a problem.\n\nThe other thing is that even on the 'fastest' setting, the game gets boring waiting for your dwarves to complete their tasks (even if they immediately jump on them), especially early on when you only have 1-2 dwarves and basic equipment. I know it's kind of supposed to feel like that early on, but this is too much. I'm just staring at the screen waiting far too often.\n\nAlso, there is a time box constantly counting down. Every 30 or so minutes (15 I think on the fastest setting), a large group of mobs attack your people. They aren't generally too difficult to defeat, but it does absolutely require your attention. I like the feature, but not ALL the time. This is a crafting game, primarily, and the demographic that likes crafting and building usually doesn't like constant distractions. We want to build our giant god damn usless-but-purty constructions and landscapes.\n\nLastly, the non-sandbox modes are brutal. Even if you have the materials to craft something, you can't craft it until you reach enough experience in the prerequisit tech tree research. I find myself crafting 14 'dyes' or 8 diving helmets or whatnot just to get enough experience in that tech to be able to craft further. It's infuriating at times. The crafting isn't all that streamlined either. Everytime you craft something new you must drag each ingredient from your inventory to its proper place. That would be forgivable IF you weren't required to craft nearly 100% of what's possible to craft to get to the end of the tech tree. One or the other. Absolutely not both.\n\nLike I said, this game has so much potential, and as it is, it was still fairly fun for me for at least the first time through. However, now when I play I just end up frustrated every time. It's like the designers are too concerned with 'what makes sense?' and not enough with 'what is fun?'. Streamline menus, find a new crafting/tech system, speed the game up, realtime 'increase priority of task', and don't have the mob attack timer on constantly. Maybe a mob attacks only when you steal a rune or something underground so you can choose the time.\n\nIt's mostly a solid game, and I'm sure some people will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. Make note of the date of this writing - perhaps they will update it and fix some issues. I want so badly to like it but sadly it isn't there yet.","October 6, 2015","false","30.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/guiniveretoo/recommended/248390/","guiniveretoo","guiniveretoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/guiniveretoo/","6 products in account","TL;DR: though this game has promise, and a few nice things about it, because of clunky tech trees, no military conrols, an uncompelling storyline, and no challenge to speak of, I'm recommending playing Terraria and Dwarf Fortress over Craft the World.\n\nI've logged 44 hours into this game so far, and am about midway through the second world. I've been playing the campaign mode, and haven't tried the sandbox, which means the below feedback is mostly about the campaign mode. From what I've seen, sandbox mode would probably improve the mechanics.\n\nPros\nAs some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the game has some strong points. To me, these aren't so amazing that they outweigh the cons, but I'll acknowledge them:\n\nThe graphics are cute, colorful, and cartoony. Tons of fun.\nThe controls are pretty smooth. Keyboard controls are nice, and interacting with the world is pretty intuitive.\nMusic is well done, if a bit repetative.\nCrafting recipes are clever - after seeing a few receipes, you start to be able to predict the next level of the tech tree. I'll get back to this in a minute.\nCons\nBecause it's such a mix of game genres - rogue sandbox strategy dungeon defense fortress builder - it's trying to be all things to all these genres and struggling to get close to any.\n\nThe rogue element would be more interesting if it were easier to fail - one of the reasons Dwarf Fortress is so amazingly fun is that once you learn the horrible UI, you can and will lose the game. The question is: HOW will you lose. Maybe a dwarf will be having a terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad day, and then his kitten will fall off a cliff and die, and suddenly his Bad Day will turn into a Tantrum Spiral and the next thing you know you have a single completely insane 3-year-old dwarf sitting on the floor of the Great Hall amidst the rotting corpses of her family, and the goblins are coming. Craft the World doesn't have any feeling that you're living on the edge, or that you should care about your dwarves' welfare or wants. A dwarf died? So what!? Another one will appear in 4 minutes. Outfit that one with some gear, he's just about as good.\n\nExploring felt too easy - what's the point of railroads that use all my iron and (buggy) elevators to speed transportation when I can just open a portal to where ever I want to go, and I can light the way with light spells that essentially let me explore the entire world without any help from dwarves at all?\n\nThe sandbox element would be more fun if it felt easier to access - particularly in the first world where the small map means that resources are scarce, I completely strip-mined my entire world of iron and barely had enough to scrape together the resources to finish the tech tree and get those last few portal peices. I had to spend it on 'fancy chandeliers' to level up my tech tree skills. This (admittedly) would work better if I were playing in sandbox mode.\n\nCrafting & Tech Tree\n\nThe crafting window is frustrating. The UI is clunky - recipes require arranging ingredients in a specific pattern in the grid - and no easy way of doing that except with the mouse, drag and drop, drag and drop the next thing. I desperately want there to be an 'auto-fill' button, especially after you've made a recipe once - no need to drag and drop ingredients every time.\n\nThe tech tree itself is frustrating - even if you know or can guess the recipe for a 'later' element in the tech tree, you MUST complete the levels below to have access to the upper-tier recipes. There's no strategy to 'leveling up' the tech tree and you can't choose what you're interested in building towards. As you get higher and higher in the tree, the relationships between the teirs makes less and less sense. For example, you have to complete the 'luxury decorating' level in order to have access to the 'master armor' level.\n\nPersonally, I'm more interested in the strategy aspect of games, and having to build 15 'decorative mirrors' in order to get the best armor makes zero sense to me. The Tech Tree should have 'tracks' - related things that build up - and cross-track requirements (like creating steel from the resources track is required to make steel armor, but not required to see the steel armor recipe).\n\nAlso, beer is one of the mid/late-game craftable items. Dwarves without beer for most of the game? That is no fun at all.\n\n(No) Military\n\nNothing pains me more than watching my expert cook throw himself at a Beholder and die a horrible death.\n\nThere's no clear way to control some Dwarves over others or assign specific dwarves to a military squad. There are essentially 3 settings for fighting:\n\nfight a chicken or sheep: a dwarf may eventually attack it, but the chicken/sheep is too fast and the dwarf gets tired of running after it and gives up\nfight a boar: attract one or two dwarves to the battle and can be somewhat successful\nfight a skeleton, zombie, beholder, or some other hostile creature: ALL your dwarves come running at top speed just for the chance at a stab at it\nThere are no controls in the game to tell a specific group of dwarves to attack while another group stays home, or for one group to attack one creature while another group attack a different creature. You just have to give the order to attack and hope that at least a few dwarves show up.\n\nThere could be more of an element of tower defense, except your defenses are going to be attacked and maybe destroyed with every enemy wave. There's very little in the way of maze-building, mostly you're just building traps and spikes to slow down attackers - hopefully you have enough guns built up out of reach that they can fend off a wave. Keeping defenses strong for the next wave means conserving resources that you would otherwise spend on leveling up the tech tree.\n\nI'd say that this could be a fun element of gameplay - balancing resources so that you can fend off the waves while still progressing in the game - except it's yet another gameplay element that feels extremely arbitrary. If I build bear traps, why do they disappear rather than needing to be reset? Why do cages trap zombies and not skeletons?\n\nGame speed\n\nYou can either pause the game, or play the game, and you can't interact with dwarves when the game is paused. There is no 'slow' or 'fast' game speed to help in crisis moments or speed up boring things.\n\nBugs\n\nWhen I started this game (about a week and a half ago), it was technically still in 'alpha', so I'll grant that there will probably be some bugs. I found a few of them.\n\nThere's an annoying bug where dwarves with nothing to do will stand around underground next to a portal instead of returning to the house, which means they can get stranded in enclosed caves if you're not careful.\n\nMy dwarves kept on falling down the elevator shaft.\n\nIronically, the 'send feedback' button on the main screen of the game would open one of the game folders in Windows Explorer.\n\n"Story" and Bosses\n\nThere's no storyline to speak of, and though there are bosses, there isn't really a reason to fight them except to get to the next level (and once you do that, you have to start over with the tech tree, a single dwarf, and no fortress). The bosses are all the same (beholders and "scroll keepers") and there's no strategy to beating them besides equipping all your dwarves as best you can and then crossing your fingers.\n\nConclusion\nIf you want more interesting game progression, crafting depth, or sandbox elements, play Terraria. If you like micromanaging a rogue dungeon, play Dwarf Fortress - or 'easy mode' DF, Gnomoria.\n\nI'm probably going to finish the campaign mode, because I'm a glutton for punishment and a completionist.","December 1, 2014","false","49.0"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

For a fortress management game, Craft the World is severely lacking in tools that enable the player to manage their little dwarf colony.\n\nBasically the way dwarves are managed is that you assign tasks by clicking on objects/tiles to harvest or creatures to kill, assigning things to be crafted, and for objects to be placed.  Along with these tasks, there is also the generic task of picking up objects that are dropped when resources are harvested.  The dwarves themselves decided which of the above tasks they will do, and in what order.  From what I've seen, unless one of their skills correlates to one of the jobs (more on that later), they will simply do whatever task is quickest to complete.  The only exception to this is when selecting an enemy to attack.  In this pretty much all dwarves will drop what they are doing to attack the enemy.\n\nThere is no way for the player to prioritize tasks or to restrict dwarves to only do certain tasks.  This means that trying to multitask is pretty much impossible as dwarves focus on tasks closest to the stockpile because they are the quickest to complete, ignoring tasks further away even if the further ones are more important.  As a result things take forever to complete.  This is made even worse when you take the pathfinding into account, expecially when it comes to gathering resources.  When a dwarf is gathering resources it tries to fill its inventory before dropping things off at the stockpile.  This means that if its inventory space is 3, and it is holding 2 objects while next to the stockpile and there is group resource across the map, the dwarf will walk all the way over to the distant pile, pick up one object, then walk all the way back to the stockpile to drop the objects off when clearly it'd be more efficient to drop off what it has, then go pickup 3 objects from the distant pile.\n\nThe only real management tools the player has is a portal and the mostly worthless skills mechanic.  The portal spell opens a temporary shortcut between a tile on the map and a the stockpile.  These portals are taken into account when calculating the speed at which a task can be completed, artficially giving distant tasks a higher 'priority' in the dwarves todo list.  However, in order to keep the piority of distant tasks high the player must constantly open up new portals near distant tasks as the tasks closest to the old portal gets completed, as the further a task is from a portal, the lower its priority is.\n\nAlong with the portals, each can also have up to 3 skills that can influence which types of jobs it takes.  For example, a dwarf with the mining skill will try to mine blocks before it tries to cut down trees, even if the trees are a quicker task to complete.  Unfortunately this mechanic is almost completely worthless as each dwarf only starts with one skill, and what that skill they start with is competely worthless.  This means that you'll most likely start with a bunch of dwarves that are skilled in worthless stuff like swimming and milling, when you really need things like mining, logging, carpentry and smithing at the start of the game.  Furthermore, the only way to get new skills for a dwarf is by applying skill books to a dwarf.  These books are rare drops that you get sometimes after harvesting a resource.  Unfortunately what skills these books teach are also completely random, meaning that you might go an hour before a book drops with a skill that you need.\n\nOverall the gameplay is excrutatingly slow and tedious.  As far as I can tell the "Campaign" of the game is just a sequence of randomly generating maps where in each one you have to build a portal in order to reach the next map.  The portal pieces are hidden in secret rooms underground that you have to find.  As levels progress the maps slowly get bigger and the difficulty gets higher.  There are no special scenarios or win conditions for any of the maps as far as I can tell, making the Campaign feel extremely boring and repetitive after the first level.\n\nIn short, do not buy this game.","December 26, 2014","false","10.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

There are a lot of items available to craft and different types of materials that can be used to build shelter. You can build traps and automated turrets, equip your dwarves with different weapons and teach them different skills using books. The goal of the game is to kill 5 guardians and rebuild the portal to the next world. There are 3 different worlds available (normal, ice, desert) with different creatures, weathers, resources and a few specific items available only in this world.\n\nAfter 30 hours of gameplay on a larger size map the game becomes a bit boring. Dwarves move slowly, mana regenerates slowly (so you cannot be using portal spell too often), maximum speed of the game is x2 (I play on max speed 95% of time). There are a few minor bugs, but they don't prevent from enjoying the game - sometimes item cannot be removed from a quick access bar or dwarves behave as if their IQ dropped to one digit number. Quick access bar at the beginning seems quite small but you get used to it (and there is another one available by pressing ctrl). There is no loading a save game - game autosaves, so when you exit you come back to what you built, hence it is not possible to undo mistakes (other than to copy save files to another directory and then bring them back).\n\nI don't remember a game released in the past few years which would be so cheap and which I would play so long - this game is definitely worth this £14.00.\n\nI am looking forward to see some other means of transport like horses, increased maximum game speed to x5 or x10 and normal game save/load system.","November 27, 2014","true","99.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You must drag and drop each instance of the resource required. WHAT? Whose idea was that?\n- Not enough to work towards (while my own time with this game was brief - I was able to get a good sense of this aspect by watching several in-depth YouTube reviews)\n- No risk/reward mechanism. You won't really die if a ginormous Zombie smacks you around and falls on you! I prefer challenge and some sense of realism!\n- The world needs to be much much bigger. Think Terraria sized worlds.\n- You can't truly take control over the characters.

The dwaves will run around in a panic and not rest or eat.  They run into monsters and do nothing.  They stand around doing nothing when there is all kinds of goods to pick up.   Dwarves will walk into enemy camps and do nothing while the enemy beats the stuffing out of them.  I'll open a portal for them to get to safety and they just stand there instead of using the portal and going to safety.  Dwarves will seal themselves into a chamber without figuring the right order to put the blocks down to ensure they can get out.  Dwarves will fall into water and drown unless you can take manual control and get them out.    Loot will just inexplicably disappear from the map.\nCRTL R - Supposed to make all dwarves rest that are under 70% health.  They are at their beds standing next to it and momentarily make a snoring sound.  But they are tired and won't lie down.  Same problem if you slect them individually and tell them to go rest so they can heal.  They'll just stand there.\nCRTL E - all hungry dwarves are supposed to eat.  They don't\nYou can select them individually and try and get them to do one of those things when they are getting the crap kicked out of them, or if they are standing around doing nothing.  Not going to work though.\n\nOther problems not bugs but just present game features -\n\nIf you click on attack every dwarf no matter where they are will ALL run to the one enemy.\nThere's really no way to assign individual dwarves to tasks.  They just do them based on what the AI decides.\nThere's no way to sell or stuff you mine to the merchant for goods, except for gold coins that you randomly find.\nYou'll find yourself constantly running out of resources, so a trade system (even an unbalanced one) would be helpful\nKeyboard interaction is limited.  You will find yourself clicking, and double clicking to select a resources.\nYou want to select a certain dwarf - you must click on the dwarf.\n\nOn a postive note:\nPretty graphics.\nDeveloper seems like a nice guy.  He notes the bugs I report but no response on an update or a known issue.\n\nSo, the game is pretty much unplayable in it's present state unless you just want to manually control each dwarf that has become unresponsive and walk them into a monster and let them die.  Then you'll get another one after a while.  But you will start from scratch and lose the skills the dwarf has aquired.  If you don't do thist, your unresponsive dwarf will either run around amlessly until is gets killed and you will lose the equipment you made for it (about 80% change of that), or it will just stand there and do absolutely nothing (which costs you one dwarf slot).\n\nHopefully the developer will fix these problems and get the game where it needs to be AI wise.\n","April 9","false","30.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

But the pacing of their movements leave a bad taste in my mouth. Imagine buying iron ores from the shop, which was 2 screens away, which I didnt expect the bought items to drop on the floor like that. Now I'd have to wait.... for certain worker to decide that "OH THERE ARE SOMETHING I COULD PICK UP THERE", then wait for a few more minutes for them to walk, again, slowly. to the shop. pickup items. "OH, the bag is full, I should go back"...... Then after arriving at the base, it'd have been night, which I'd have to lock the house for the safe of the party.\n\nThe night was passed by, slowly, something like  5 or more minutes of unable to do anything.... because it was night time, with peril monsters and ghost wondering around. I really wished I could dig down the house to do something below... but it was not possible due to the prohibition during the night. Ah, well, zzzzzzzzzz............\n\nthe new dawn has come, with the light of the sun, the darkness was gone. The dwarfs went out on their journey. I hoped for them to go and take the ore I had bought yesterday.... but NO. They like the woods and stones dropped nearby, so they all went in another direction, slowly, to get something I dont really need at the time, without a way for me to say "HEY YOU RED, GO THERE!"\n\nAnd thus I closed the game... hoping the bad cloud in my mind would dissappear when I went back for the game, one more time, some time.\n\nMaybe.\n\nHopefully.\n\nAt the current state, I'd not recommeneded the game to anyonem looking for some Terraia HD. I shall see again after some more updates from devs.....","June 29, 2014","false","1.0"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","2"

It possesses the same problem which caused me to abandon attempts to play Terraria: there is simply too little complexity in game's world, so in the end procedural stories do not quite happen.\n\nQuite simply, CtW isn't "simplified Dwarf Fortress", but rather "Terraria with Somewhat Indirect Control". While you (usually) do not take direct control of any single dwarf (although there is such an option, and it's often helpful), your dwarves show very little signs of thinking for themselves. They have no mental model like those of DF, and they certainly seem far more simple than, say, heroes in old Majesty game. Watching them is plainly boring, because they rarely do things for themselves, but only hurry to complete tasks you set for them, idling or sleeping when there is nothing to do.\n\nAlso, this is a game about DWARVES where said dwarves do not quite care for BEER and only brew it for a very slight food value at high level of technology. WTF?!\n\nI guess CtW isn't a BAD game per se. Maybe it suits someone who likes management games, or something else which I don't like. I would refrain from marking my review as positive or negative if I could. Just don't expect it, like I did, to see an independently living world in it.\n\nOn a positive side, I must remark that this game is REALLY beautiful, and sound of birdsong is very nice too :)","December 20, 2014","false","25.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"
