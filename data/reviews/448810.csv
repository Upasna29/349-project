Once you start playing it, you can\'t help but keep going deeper into the dungeons. Addictively fun.","June 1","true","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You truly can play at your own pace as it features a system similar to Super Hot - IE your enemies only move when you do. Try it on nightmare to get your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ smashed. 10/10 would recommend.","May 31","true","6.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
