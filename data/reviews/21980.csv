"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/21980/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","This game is how sequels should be - it takes everything that was good about the first game and improves it, builds on the old characters, and smooths out the rough edges of the original. The two brothers play differently enough to give an incentive to play through it twice, so there's plenty of value to it. The only reason I ever had to not recommend it before was because the field of view was extremely low (46 degrees) with no way to fix it, but thankfully a mod has finally fixed that recently, allowing you to go up to 75 (which is still pretty low, but a lot more manageable). http://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood-realism-mod I don't recommend using the date-changing part of the mod (the read-me and description explains how to only apply the gameplay changes), but everything else about the mod is great. With this mod, I can finally completely recommend this game.\n\nAlso, on another note, if you have problems with the voices sounding like they were recorded in a bad microphone, you may need to lower the audio quality of your sound device in Windows. It probably won't be a problem for most people, but if you have a high quality sound system and use 24-bit audio, you may need to switch to 16-bit, 44100 Hz for this game.","April 11, 2015","true","32.3"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","47","51","3","2"

It is a story of a younger Ray McCall and his brothers Thomas and William.\nLike its predecessor, the game is a first-person shooter with the Western setting. And like the first Call of Juarez it has a captivating story, a little "dark" atmosphere, two playable characters with two different playstyles (and this time - the ability to freely choose your character for a given episode, except for the first two "tutorial" episodes and the one near the endgame) and lots of gun-blazing action.\nWhat I am going to say is that this game is in my opinion the best Call of Juarez game and one of the best western and FPS games I've ever played. Almost all the flaws from the first game are gone here, Bound in blood runs smoothly, has beautiful graphics, great atmosphere and soundtrack, cool plot that will keep you in tension for the whole game, epic finale that will probably make you shed a small manly tear, and two badass characters to play.\nAbout the characters: Ray McCall plays almost the same as he did in the first game being able to dual-wield pistols and throw dynamites, although personality-wise here he is not a preacher and acts like a total badass. His brother Thomas is a little similar to Billy Candle - he is the agile guy of this game, he can do some lasso swinging, he can use throwing knives for stealthy kills (although you won't need to be stealthy in this game as much as it was needed in the first) and he can use a bow with arrows. There are still not that many weapons in the game, but there is definitely more, than it was in the first CoJ, and you can buy upgraded versions of the same weapon.\nIn the end, there is really nothing serious I can point out as bad things, I was completely satisfied with the game. If you liked the first CoJ, this is a must. If you like Western theme this is a must. If you want a cool story and a decent FPS game this is a must.\nVERDICT: 9/10","November 3, 2014","true","9.7"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","46","51","0","0"

Bound in Blood serves as a prequel to the original's story, and it manages to polish some mechanics from the original game, but it does not try to reach as far as it's predecessor.\n\nBound in Blood tells the story of the McCall brothers and it covers some familiar ground. Ray still charges in headfirst with guns blazing, while his brother Thomas acts as Billy Candle's surrogate, taking up the stealth and whip mechanics with a focus on long range weaponry (including the bow).\n\nOverall the game feels very familiar, but with some slight gameplay changes. You can now (for most missions) choose which character to play prior to starting to the mission. This choice will slightly alter how you play a level (distraction vs. stealth), and it will also drastically change how you play. The mechanics of the two characters also feel a bit more fleshed out ( the slow down for Thomas is not limited to the bow, and Ray has more than a bible and breastplate to set him apart). One neat addition is that the brothers are usually working together and the AI is fairly competent. Though their one-liners outstay their welcome before the credits role, its neat to hear the brothers call out to each other and actually have them help, rather than the mostly isolated experience from the first game.\n\nA few other slight changes include  equipment. You will find and be rewarded with money that you can use to buy more ammo and better guns. You can also make extra money during a few little open world sequences where you can hunt down bounty. I never found myself too concerned with money, though I would run out of ammo every now and then, but  I was always happy to get a better weapon. Overall though, the money is more of an optional bit of fun rather than a necessity.\n\nThe story, much like the first one, is not the absolute best narrative, but it serves its purpose well. Some of the ties it makes to the first game (both in the levels and characters) are pretty interesting if you were a fan of the first game. The lore and charm that the game is steeped in shines clearly in this entry, and it feels familiar in a good way.\n\nBound in Blood makes great use of its Old West setting to tell a story of sibling rivalry through solid FPS mechanics. Fans and strangers alike should give this entry a try.","April 2, 2014","true","9.0"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","36","39","0","0"

And it does so without seeming unpleasantly pro or anti christian.\n-A good manual save system (no annoying checkpoint reloads).\n-No Ubisoft Uplay account required!\n\nThe Bad (mostly minor):\n-A very low Field-of-View (not fixable) due to being optimized for console TV screens.\n-The first level (tutorial) has clumsy scripting and mediocre graphics, but it gets better with later levels.\n-Bodies disappear the moment you look away, due to silly Xbox360/PS3 RAM limits.\n-AI is mediocre (not a big problem since most things are scripted)\n-screen vibration effects severely overdone during scripted explosions.\n-Enemies move like ants (no movement inertia), making aiming a pain sometimes.\n\nThe Ugly:\n-No COOP mode! With the two protagonists working together, this game would have been perfect for co-op, and yet there is no co-op mode! What a missed opportunity!\n\nOverall, I can easily recommend this game, especially in a sale.","July 8, 2015","true","22.4"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","32","34","10","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/21980/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","For a game dated back to 2009, COJ:BIB shows that the developers, Techland, have learned some lessons from their previous COJ games and concentrate on shooting people rather than playing Indiana Jones or Tarzan, and they certainly built up a bunch of characters that have a bit more dimension than typical western shooter fare, and it is only surpassed by the latest COJ: Gunslinger.\n\nBIB has the McCall brothers, with family in Georgia, fighting as a part of the Confederacy trying to hold back the Yankee army against General Sherman's raid. You'll spend most of the first part of the game shooting Yankee soldiers defending your homeland, so to speak, and later, fight your way home to save your brother and mother... against orders to withdraw, which makes both of the McCall brothers deserters. Without too much of a spoiler, by the time they arrived, mother's already dead, and the younger brother actually is a priest and will not fight.  After fighting they way out of Georgia, McCalls drifted to Arkansas, enraged the local sheriff (by spoiling his daughter), who challenged them to a duel, got killed, and the entire town started to hunt them forcing them to run for Mexico, where the senior McCall, Ray, told them about the alleged treasure of Juarez, and how they can claim it and use it to rebuilt their family.\n\nThe two brothers have different specialties. Ray, the older and stronger brother, is a close quarters combat guy with dual revolvers and dynamite. He can use concentration (COJ's "bullet time") to designate targets for rapid salvos killing a whole slew of targets at a time. Thomas "Tom", the middle brother, prefers a ranged and stealth attack. He is deadly with a rifle, he can throw knives for silent kills, and he can use a lasso to raise himself to a better elevation for better sniper kills. He can also use a bow later in the game. He also has a concentration mode but he can only engage up to 6 targets in a "quick draw".\n\nAt the beginning the scripted missions are one following another, and sometimes you can choose which brother to play in the mission, with slightly different branches and levels, as it's two different POVs of the same game. Later, when the game opens up, you can roam the land and take on side missions for extra cash, treasure, and so on, and encounter traders with better weapons available for sale. There are even random encounters.\n\nThere are quick drawn duels in the game where you need to keep the guy in view and keep your hand near the pistol, and use the mouse to "draw" the pistol and shoot. This mechanic was vastly improved in Gunslinger though.\n\nThe game, being old runs fine on a 3 year old gaming laptop even at higher resolutions. While the tasks are a bit monotonous (shoot people) it's what makes Western a Western, right?\n\nI personally prefer Gunslinger. Skip the Cartel, IMHO. Play this and Gunslinger should be enough COJ.","November 28, 2015","true","1.8"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","30","34","0","1"

A brilliant game brings amazing level design, amazing combat systems, beautiful scenery, and the perfect ambience to life.\n\nStory:\nCall of Jaurez Bound in Blood acts a prequel to Call of Jaurez. The story takes off with the alleged rivalry between Thomas and Ray McCall; yet, how did the rivalry all begin? The game takes off during the Civil War playing as the McCalls as they fight for the south. As they abandon the cause and go out on their own the story takes off with how the Gold of Jaurez and the beautiful Marissa draws the brothers to unite but then tears them apart.\n\nCampaign:\nThis epic campaign allows you to play as either Ray or Thomas McCall for each mission. Both the characters play differently with Ray being similar to Call of Jaurez. Ray has perks in pistol usage and can use dual pistols unlike Thomas who plays stealthier using a Bow and Rifles. Both of the brothers can wield rifles and pistols, but Thomas can wield a Bow, Lasso, and Knives while Ray can wield twin pistols and dynamite. Thomas being the younger of the two brothers must help his older brother climb up ledges and complete tasks while Ray typically sits back and supports him. There are fifteen chapters, although two of those chapters are open world and offers three missions each. You can purchase weapons within most levels that make your character more powerful, although they are not entirely necessary. The campaign is incredibly easily even on Hard difficulty, but once you complete the campaign you unlock Harder difficulty. Almost every level contains a duel which allows you to test your dukes with fast timing draw.\n\nGameplay:\nUnlike in the predecessor they have fleshed out a lot of the kinks in the combat system. The duel system pits you one on one with an adversary where you must line yourself straight in with an opponent, rapidly draw your gun at the sound of a bell, and pull the trigger. Each of the two brothers has a different quick draw technique which requires different mechanisms to implement. I personally did not like Thomasâ quick draw as it is limited to one pistol and doesn't give you control of what is going on around you. There are many weapons which offer three different stats: Reload Speed, Damage, and Range. Although none of these guns list ammunition capacity which is incredibly important.\n\nHints:\n>Donât purchase ammunition; it is completely worthless as you find so much of it during the game.\n>The Volcano Gun carries twelve bullets, which is the largest out of any pistol.\n>The Heavy Rifle is essentially the scoped rifle without a scope.\n>There is no Superb Scoped Rifle; you might as well buy the prime one as it kills almost all enemies in one hit. (You can also find one on Chapter 11 at the point where the wagon gets stuck in the river).\n>Apparently your money transfers over to the next play-through.\n\nResults:\nIf you are a fan of the Western Genre Call of Jaurez Bound in Blood is a fantastic play-through. Luckily because it is a prequel to the original Call of Jaurez you can play this game prior or without playing the original. The campaign adds amazing depth to the lore of Call of Jaurez and its beautiful storyline draws the player into a gripping tale. The campaign is a good length, about seven hours and eight hours if you do all the side quests in the open world chapters. Because of how the two brothersâ play differently I could easily play this game again just using the other brother because it would alter the game significantly. If you love shoot âem up westerns, just want to go on a killing frenzy, or desire a good store then this is the game for you. I donât buy many games at full price, but at $9.99 this game is a steal.\n\nPros:\n+Fantastic campaign\n+Beautiful level design\n+Offers two open world levels that allow you to explore while being based on linear gameplay. [I am not a fan of open-world first person shooters, but by only partially integrating open world dynamics into the campaign really makes a good twist].\n+Amazing weapon combinations which each offer great potential to how you play the game.\n+A story which gets you to continue playing even if only just to figure out what happens next.\n+You get to fight during the civil war, against the Indians, and as a bandit.\n\nCons:\n-For some odd reason when I started the game the opening cinematic, Ubisoft Logo, and the menu cinematic where all upside down. [At first I thought it was some artsy design, but then I noticed Ubisoft was not tlosidU].\n-The duels can be irritating as you have to drag the mouse down to draw the pistol [if you have a tiny space for your mouse this can be hard].","April 9, 2014","true","9.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

The characters are extremely well done and the story is interesting enough to hold the entire game together and keep you interested until the very end.\n\n+ Before every mission you have a choice to play as either Ray or Thomas. Each one has their own unique pros and cons and sometimes in the mission they may diverge and go on separate paths offering a different perspective in certain situations.\n\n+ The western frontier setting once again takes center stage and is even more beautiful and breathtaking than the original.\n\n+ The shooting mechanics are greatly improved over the first game.\n\n+ Soundtrack\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nEvery once in a while you will have a one on one duel in which you have to be quick to draw out your gun and shoot your opponent. These moments are pretty intense and fun and its handled extremely well. The only problem however is that using a mouse makes it almost impossible to succeed. After failing many attempts, I switched over to a controller and was able to beat in on my first try.\n\nThe level design itself can also feel a bit repetitive at times. The levels are way more linear than the first game but the objectives in each mission starts to feel the same half way through. Go here, kill all the enemies, rinse and repeat.\n\nAs you play, your npc companions will often comment on how well or badly you are doing. It makes the characters more believable, however after hearing the same comments for the fifth time it starts to get annoying.\n\nRegenerating health trivialize battles\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-In what has to be one of the stranger bugs I've ever experienced, the videos are upside down. This is almost a universal issue with the game with no fix/patch in sight. Not exactly a good impression when you start the game and literally the first thing you see is a game bug.\n\nConclusion\n\nA HUGE improvement over the first game, just about everything has been upgraded and improved upon. At times though I felt like I was playing Call of Duty: The Western. Regenerating health, linear levels, and shooting hordes of bad guys over and over again. A fun game and worth checking out.\n","December 13, 2015","true","6.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

But this sequel is a true sequel.  Actually, this is a prequel to the original game.  The characters in this game are deeply related to the characters of the original game, and the game does  a great job of linking the two together.  The story weaves a wonderful tale and makes perfect sense with how the events of the original game pan out.  The action in the game was upgraded with some quick action events, and better dueling.  You get to choose between the two brothers throughout most of the game, which is nice since they each offer a different skill set.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bradypus/recommended/21980/","bradypus","sloth spudscraper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bradypus/","4068 products in account","A prequel to Call of Juarez, Bound in Blood follows the three McCall brothers on their adventures and misadventures. Two brothers are the playable protagonists while the third one just sort of tags along and whines. Ray is the oldest and toughest of the three, a badass gunslinger. He starts the first game as Reverend Ray, while at the beginning of Bound in Blood he is about as far from a Reverend as you can get, so you'll get to see what made him give up violence.\nUnlike the first game where you were assigned the player character in each mission, most of Bound in Blood's missions will allow you to choose either Ray, who is a close quarters dual revolver wielding dynamite throwing death machine and Thomas who prefers long-range encounters using a rifle or a bow. Sometimes your choice of character alters the mission in a way, like one brother goes through the mines while the other goes on surface for a part of the mission.\n\nThe game is more action-packed than its predecessor, with plenty of exploding stuff and chases and whatnot.\n\nBetween missions you have access to an open world where you can take some jobs and rescue folks from bandits. The jobs are either killing a lot of dudes, or the same thing but with a duel in the end. With money you get from these jobs and from fallen enemies you can buy better weapons in the store. As far as I can tell, your guns don't explode like in CoJ so it's safe to invest in that shiny rifle.\n\nAnother addition is a cover system which automatically applies when you're next to suitable cover. In most cases this feels really natural and helpful, although sometimes it just sticks you somewhere in a bad way. Still, it's a nice system and would be nice to see it improved on in another game.\n\nUnlike CoJ, Bound in Blood does work fine with Steam overlay and was rock solid for me on Win10. Only weird issue is the intro videos (Publisher and developer logos and stuff) are mirrored and in B/W for some reason, but main menu & anything onwards runs good. Graphics still sort of hold up 7 years later, although there is this field of depth when aiming that not everyone might like.\n\nOverall, Bound in Blood is much better than the first game in pretty much every aspect and I wholeheartedly recommend it.

Set in 1864, and then 1865, and later, 1866, Bound in Blood revolves around the McCall brothers. You might recall Ray McCall, the badass priest from the first game. And you might remember Thomas McCall, the "father" of Billy Candle from the first game. Well, they're the stars of Bound in Blood, and their youngest brother, William, shares the adventure with them as the good shepard, a preacher.\n\nThe game beings in 1864, when the Civil War is coming close to an end. Ray McCall is a member of the Confederate Army, and works to make sure Thom is safe. Ultimately, the two brothers desert their ranks to save their family from the Union army. They manage to save WIlliam, but their mother has already passed away. This is where the game's story really picks up. Their commanding officer is Barnsby, and he is rather â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off that the McCall brothers fled. He's also delusional and thinks that, despite the Union army winning the war, he can help revitalize the southern army and win the war.\n\nAnyway, the McCall brothers follow what I like to call the "classic Western format." The classic Western format is when a group of people, the people here being the McCall brothers, travel a great distance with a single goal in mind, to make some money in order to rebuild their family home. They travel, and run into a great number of characters, some of which are in the first game, set some 18 years after the events of this game. Withtout getting into the plot, the gist of the McCall brothers traveling involve getting into plenty of gun fights.\n\nThe narrative of William is easily the centerpoint of the game. It's strong and well written. It emphasizes the various themes of the game, and his narrative will ultimately lead Ray to become the man he becomes in the first Call of Juarez game. I will say that the writing and story in Bound in Blood is quite strong. What's not strong would be the animation. I'm not surprised either, it's a Techland game and most of their games have animation that's not terrible, but not great, like Naughty Dog or Remedy or Rockstar great. However, the vast openess of the game, despite being a linear shooter, is remarkable, and does more to make up for the games few technical shortcomings. The scope of the world that Techland made is quite something. It's not surprising considering how they've transitioned into the open world genre with their more recent games. Hell, even Bound in Blood has some "intermission" parts where you can do a few side quests in a semi-open world zone.\n\nPretty tight game overall though. Voice acting could be better from a few characters. And some of the visual effects weren't executed that great; most post processing effects really, specifically Depth of Field.\n\n8.3/10","May 2","true","8.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","0"

Much needed and refreshing. I really loved the desert landscape and the horses. For a 2009 game I believe the graphics are still nice  enough for me and not demanding on my gear (playing eyefinity 4800x900, getting a constant 60fps with an ATI HD5870 1GB on max settings.\n\nYou can feel the hot sun and the dust around you. The only problem I encountered is with the cut scenes. For an obscure reason they are all zoomed in, most of the time I could not see the faces. Not sure if it is related to my eyefinity setup or the game itself. I heard some people having upside down cut scenes and other weird annoying problems.\n\nAt first I wasn't so sure about the gun play, it felt weird and slow, very slow but I soon realized that it's because it's the 1800's and the weapons were not as sophisticated as the one you find in modern day fps like call of duty for instance.\nBut once you start upgrading (buying new guns) it gets much better and the fire fights are actually pretty satisfying, especially playing  as Ray (dual pistols). The duels in my opinion are far too often and very annoying, not fun to perform, they are more frustrating than satisfying. I would have prefer fewer duels and more live battles against the bosses. The story and the characters are interesting, not revolutionnary but well executed and the voice acting is amazing.\n\nIn the end, I found myself enjoying the game more than when I started it but I had to deal with the zoomed in cut scenes. If you are in search of a nice shooter with decent story, great western atmosphere which I believe is not that common than this is for you. Got mine on sale for 4.99. For this price, it was entertaining and enjoyable.\n\n*Forgot to mention that there is what seems to be a common bug at the beginning where you try to escape the city on a stage coach but you get killed every single time, I went reading about it online and you have to turn down your graphics all the way and it allows you to complete this problematic section. It was frustrating, I think I tried it like 10 times.","January 28","true","12.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I'll try to keep it short.\n\nThings I enjoyed:\n\n-Engaging story\n-Characters aren't complex but seem mostly realistic\n-Neat cover mechanic that is optional and not required or forced but still handy\n-Learning curve and difficulty is very good\n-Varied environments\n-Duels are awesome\n-2 different characters offer slightly different play styles\n-Ray is too cool\n\nThings I did not enjoy:\n-Repetitiveness toward the end\n-Scripted events that I was not prepared for the first time\n-Weapon choice isn't as varied as I'd like\n-Villains are forgettable and hurt the neat story slightly\n-Not much replay ability other than collectible scrolls\n\nWestern setting FPS, and just Old West games in general are pretty rare especially on PC. For that reason I'm willing to say it's a must try for anyone who likes that kind of setting. Anyone else might not appreciate it and be able to fall into the story. I feel that though the mechanics make it a functional game it is pretty story driven and somewhat cinematic. I really enjoyed it and may play it again in the future.","April 16","true","16.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's a little bit older by now in game standards but it still shines like a gem when compared to many other FPS's. The replay value is pretty good in my opinion since you can play as either of the two brothers and use a variety of different guns throughout the game that you can slowly upgrade if you keep your coffers full. The graphics still hold up pretty well too, they aren't perfect but even today I can go back and admire the beauty that is B.i.B. The campaign isn't the longest and I do wish it could be longer, but I do go back and play through this game fairly regularly and enjoy EVERY SECOND. The Western FPS franchise is a niche in today's game world as there aren't many titles that can claim they are part of the "Western Genre". In my honest opinion, and most likely the opinion of others, any Western FPS that comes out following this game would do well and GREATLY BENEFIT from taking some pointers from this game. I'd give it a 9/10, and the fact that it is only 10.00 dollars on steam (not counting sales) makes this game a steal.","November 7, 2014","true","13.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The story mode is great (maybe a little bit short, though), with a dramatic storyline and the action is intensive. Also, it has the most addictive multiplayer ever with many classes to unlock, maps to play on and also a handful of game modes to try.\n\nIf you are runing Windows 7 or Windows 8 you might experience some issues, though. Like the videos (not the cutscenes!) rendering upside-down in black and white. Also, in order to run the game I had to switch the sound sampling of my PC down to CD and also to play multiplayer, I had to disable all of my network adapters except for the main one.\n\nSaddly, due to the game being slightly old and lacking propper support for Win 7 and 8, there are not many servers online and sometimes there are just a few players to play with.\n\nAnyway, despite its flaws, the game is very nice, with beautiful graphics to look at and nice action to keep you thrilled.

With a brilliant dynamic cover system, clever duel wielding, and a vary enjoyable "semi-freeroam" setup in the story mode, this is a thoroughly enjoyable game to play.\n\nGraphically it is rather good, having aged well. The audio is of rather low quality, for seemingly no reason, but the sounds that are there actually work well and the music - while a little out of place at times - is excellent for the most part.\n\nBut again, what makes this game really stand out is the fantastic story. This game would also make an amazing film, with a story that twists and turns, pulls on all the emotional strings and gets you on the edge of your seat. The ending came about too quickly and too abrubtly however.\n\nAll in all, if you enjoyed the first Call of Juarez or like the Wild Western scene, this is a game worth your money.\n\nOn a "bugs" note, playing this game on Windows 8 will cause the intro movies to play flipped up to down and left to right , and in black and white.

Shortly it is a western style first person shooter.\n\nYou can play as 2 characters: stealth or brute though the nature of the game seems to favor the stealth approach.\n\nThe story was rather good, not heroistic. You don't get to be a good guy, you're a bloody bandit and a murderer.\n\nThe game was extremely linear though. Reminded me of Splinter Cell Conviction in that aspect. I think there were 7 side missions in Bound In Blood and they all served the purpose of earning money to buy better weapons. The nature of the side missions was not different as well: go somewhere, kill some guys, duel.\n\nThe duel was probably one of the distinctive elements of the game. I personally found that irritating.\n\nThere were not many guns in the game but the ones that were, were interesting. Weapon upgrade in game was extremely well balanced.\n\nVerdict: It's an original game with a good story, working controls and good flow.

Open maps which often boils down to one vs. one's and quick draws.\n\nThe game does deserve credit for attempting a scenario that works contrary to how the FPS genre is structured and coming away quite well from it.

It took me a solid hour to complete\n\nStory is very replayable I like how you play as 2 different characters and it actually makes a difference who you chose but what annoyed me was how it made me chose my character before they introduce me to the level, so I'd be playing as Rey (the duel revolver guy with the school-shooter trench coat) on a level where we were fighting Native Americans and therefor I couldn't get ammo for my revolver so I relied on using a terrible rifle.\n\n\nIn the end though I did have some fun and I'd definetly recommend this game especially since it's so cheap.","March 26","true","9.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I must say, although it was only about 8 hours of play time, it was the best 8 hours I have ever spent playing a first person shooter (single player) I own over 450 games, and this is without exaggeration my favorite game of all. It is truly a hidden gem. I highly recommend to anyone who is considering buying it. The game was more like an interactive movie, and the storyline was very rich (really a great deal to think about and reflect on - long after the game was over.) I am very pleased with my purchase, and I'm hoping they will some day come out with more downloadable content, as I would purchase it without any hesitation.

I found the controls to be rather unresponsive although if the game was worth my time I might adjust those to improve my experience but after a couple of hours play, I'm that bored with the linear play that I just cant be bothered.\n\nWould I spend Â£10 on this game knowing what I know now?  NO (Not even Â£1.99)\nDo I think that the Publisher/Developer/Seller should have more integrity about the issues left unstated before purchase and not leave the consumer to try to resolve basic issues even on older titles? YES (Ubisoft/Techland/Steam)\n\nIt seems that the issues running under Win 8 are known but the Publisher/Developer have refused to patch or update and leave the user out in the cold, poor show.\n\nThe game quality should you manage to get the game to run in a playable state is generally poor in my opinion, i'd say that this is the worst FPS i've ever played.

Yes because I'm anal, even with movies/videos so shut the f*ck up.\n\nFirst off it's made by TECHLAND! A game company JUST AS BAD as Spark Unlimited (whom made Legendary [$0.98], Turning Point - Fall of Liberty [$1.22], and other god awful pieces of sh*t!). Techland developed Dead Island, a terrible bugged flaw because those idoit Ukrainian's (I'm Ukrainian and I'm offended to know them) can't develop games WORTH SH*T! They then created Dyling Light, I've been scared to play it, and apparently it burns out your computer like Watch Dogs. Not surprising at all...\n\nAnyways, this game is a wild west first person shooter. So it has the elements of Red Dead Redemtion, and Call of Duty 2. To be honest, it's actually a FUNCTIONAL GAME!? :O\nThere's even combat hiding elements where you can peek over corners like in Crysis, that's pretty neat sh*t.\n\nI'm really shocked, if they can make this an ACTUAL game, Techland should stick with linear based shooters AND NOT OPEN WORLD NON-OPTIMIZED PIECES OF FILTH DIARRHEA!\n\nThe storyline is interesting, the character development is very well done.\nI'm actually, like, stunned. It's the same feeling the Angry Video Game Nerd has when he plays the first good LJN game. It's, a miracle!\n\nWhen you kill enough enemies you build up a "rage-meter" to slow down time and execute any enemies you see. The only thing that doesn't make sense is that the "rage-meter" is timed when it's full so it forces you to use it or you loose it. Even if there's no enemies around??\n\nI would actually recommend this game, especially if you like Call of Duty 2 and western shooters. Even if it's Techland.\nNow... I go on to play the original.

The game is prefect for the fan of westerns, in a way it is like True Grit (the orginal not the redone version) mixed with The Good The Bad The Ugly if you have Red Dead Redemption then you should also have this game.\n\nI was really disapointed that the devlopers never came back and patched the game, and I was not about to attempted every fix I read about (one of which involved Reinstalling this game three "3"times that is the definition of insanity) especially when I already have the game on xbox. for this reason I can not reccomend this game due to my preception that the majority of PC gamers have already moved onto Windows 10 or stayed with Windows 7 and since buying this game for one of those operating systems is such a big gamble even for the cheap price, I'm gonna have to fold on this deal.\n\nCaveat Emptor/10","May 15","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/21980/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","This is a superb sequel to an already super Western-themed FPS. Bound in Blood is the prequel to the critically acclaimed Call of Juarez. We play as the younger Ray McCall and also his brother, Thomas. Unlike the first episode, BiB is not strict when it comes to player selection: you can complete the larger part of the story just playing one of the protagonists. I preferred Ray as with him I believe the Western experience is better - he shoots first and asks questions later. Thomas can use a lasso and handles the rifle better but he is the weaker brother.\n\nRay and Thomas fight in the war between the states when they become deserters as they find it important to save their farm. This is an interesting turn of events as not only do you fight bandits in this episode but also the soldiers of the confederacy along with the Navajo and Apache native tribes.\n\nGameplay-wise CoJ did not change one bit: you pretty much shoot everybody who's moving. Occasionally you use dynamite to blow things up and this time you can complete sidequests sometimes before progressing the story further. Also, your pistols do not overheat, thus, you can just play the game with what you have without having to stop for one sec.\n\nThe game looks beautiful. The explosions of your dynamite, the forests in the mountains, the riverbed and ghost town all are examples how well Techland's Chrome engine performs. The game is also optimised very well, so no glitches are found throughout the game.\n\nFor those of you who liked the original game Bound in Blood is a must. For those who never played it can pick this one up right away as this is a prequel, thus, not directly linked to its predecessor.","January 10, 2014","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

WARNING: WinXP and VISTA ONLY !!!!!\nNice game, especially when western games are so rare. Solid story, good gameplay, no hi-tech M-16's/M4's. My complain is, that special weapons (bow etc.), "bullet time" and abilty of one character to climb roofs and obstacles are far from its full potential:\n- You are fighting in the street of mexican village, perfect place to climb the roofs and shoot the bad guys from there - and you cannot do that. You climb the place and there is invisible barrier, that throws you down.\n- "Bullet time" is great when there is group of enemies - but on hard difficulty (which is not difficult at all if you are used to play FPS), you are killed before you get to the range\n\n- some weapons are hard to get, or too late in-game, so I greatly recommend this mod:\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood-realism-mod/downloads/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood-realism-mod\nIt tweaks weapon a little bit, but especially fills the inventory in shops.\n\nRecommendation: If you want to enjoy the game and add more challenge, skip the lever-action rifle and use double barrel shotgun or single shot (sharps rifle) instead. Mod above makes it much easier to get them. Instead of wiping out group of enemies in almost no time it changes the fight in one-by-one, man-to-man miniduels. Switch to revolver, when ambushed by group of bad boys in small space - thats what they are for.\n\nWIN7 and higher:\nALMOST impossible to play. On Win7 x64 Ultimate it crashes within minutes of the gameplay and not only crashes - it completely shuts down my computer. I have no idea what about older systems, but the new ones are doomed.\nI have tryed every solution, I have found - compatibility modes, sound changes etc. - to no effect.\n\nConclusion:\nA) If you have PC with older OS, it may be game for you - I enjoyed it a lot.\nB) If you have more up-to-date system, think twice, whether you are willing to buy, install and try something, that has high chances to never work for you.","December 28, 2014","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some mildly frustrating spots, and I never really got the hang of the cover mechanic, but I got through anyway.\n\nOne thing that I especially appreciate about the game is that taking down enemies feels like it matters. There are some shooters where you can hammer away at your opponents, yet never make actual progress until your character occupies some portion of the map geometry. That's not the case here. Defeating enemies means that you're turning the tide in your favor, in a way that's noticeable pretty quickly.","December 25, 2014","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are highly improved, and they look pretty awesome. Gunplay is hectic, no matter which of the two brothers you choose, and it's so satisfying to both drop people dead with just one Heavy Rifle shot as Thomas, or send a hail of lead from the mouth of a dismounted Gatling Gun as Ray. The story is only there to keep the game together, but that doesn't mean it's badly written. Civil War, mexicans and indians. What more could you ask for from a Western? On the other hand, the player character's animations are just as awfully unattractive, and the game engine is riddled with bugs, but that's come to be expected of Techland. The multiplayer is also deader than dirt, but that doesn't stop the singleplayer from being a pleasant and somewhat replayable experience. You should buy both this and Call of Juarez together, in order to complete the story and find out what happened to the McCalls after all.","December 7, 2012","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it is a blast! The theme of Wild West is done really well from the environments to the characters to the gunslinging. I love the showdown mechanics they use even if it does get a tad easy to figure them out once you understand the cues. The automatic cover system can get a bit annoying at times, but at the same time I liked it. I suppose they do have an option to shut that off if you don't like that though.

I got the game on sale, thinking "its probably not that good but why not" and now I can safely say I was wrong.\n\nFirst off, the gameplay itself was surprisingly smooth. The way your character holds the gun when firing from cover was really satisfying. I expected below average gunplay but i'll admit it is fairly good. No actual gore system in the game (boo!) but it made up for that by making it satisfying to see someone get shot. I've noticed very few bugs so far. I guess the gameplay is slightly above average, compared to most fps shooters ive played. The main story missions were pretty varied and werent that repetitive (save for the first couple of levels, those were painfully dull), but almost all the side missions had the same exact level structure. Go to area, fight a number of bandits or enemies, bandit leader offers a duel, win duel, get reward.\n\nThe graphics, for a game from 2009, were alright. Nothing special, but nothing too fancy either. Characters are highly detailed compared to everything else, and the guns skins also. Scenery is actually quite fancy in this game, with views of mountains, cliffs and forests that were pleasing to the eye.\n\nUmm... as for the story, well it is a bit bland, and somewhat cliche, but at the same time, each level ending was kindof a cliffhanger to the next which did keep me playing to find out what happens next. A few of the lines were badly written, a few of the plot twists were predictable, and a few of the jokes were corny (and also the damn "Yeehaa!"-ing was annoying) but it was decent enough story-wise. My biggest complaint would be that some characters were waaaay too cliche and boring. Voice acting wasnt exactly great either.\n\nOne thing that was really cool, was that the two main characters had different skill sets (one was a close range tank brawler, the other was more of a long range and stealth kinda fighter) and you could play most levels as either character (replayability ding!) and that one character could duel wield pistols, the other could throw knives, etc. It was a fairly balanced skill set, however i found myself tending to pick the close range brother more often (maybe he was a bit OP compared to his long range bro) but both offered some unique gameplay aspects and i would often play differently depending on which character i chose.

The gameplay itself is also really fun, and I really felt at times like I was running and gunning through old western towns. The graphical engine also impressed extremely for what is almost a 3 year old game. The game is not absolutely flawless, but if see this for $5 or less there is no way you will regret picking it up.

The graphics are highly improved, and they look pretty awesome. Gunplay is hectic, no matter which of the two brothers you choose, and it's so satisfying to both drop people dead with just one Heavy Rifle shot as Thomas, or send a hail of lead from the mouth of a dismounted Gatling Gun as Ray. The story is only there to keep the game together, but that doesn't mean it's badly written. Civil War, mexicans and indians. What more could you ask for from a Western? On the other hand, the player character's animations are just as awfully unattractive, and the game engine is riddled with bugs, but that's come to be expected of Techland. The multiplayer is also deader than dirt, but that doesn't stop the singleplayer from being a pleasant and somewhat replayable experience. You should buy both this and Call of Juarez together, in order to complete the story and find out what happened to the McCalls after all.","December 7, 2012","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

WARNING: WinXP and VISTA ONLY !!!!!\nNice game, especially when western games are so rare. Solid story, good gameplay, no hi-tech M-16's/M4's. My complain is, that special weapons (bow etc.), "bullet time" and abilty of one character to climb roofs and obstacles are far from its full potential:\n- You are fighting in the street of mexican village, perfect place to climb the roofs and shoot the bad guys from there - and you cannot do that. You climb the place and there is invisible barrier, that throws you down.\n- "Bullet time" is great when there is group of enemies - but on hard difficulty (which is not difficult at all if you are used to play FPS), you are killed before you get to the range\n\n- some weapons are hard to get, or too late in-game, so I greatly recommend this mod:\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood-realism-mod/downloads/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood-realism-mod\nIt tweaks weapon a little bit, but especially fills the inventory in shops.\n\nRecommendation: If you want to enjoy the game and add more challenge, skip the lever-action rifle and use double barrel shotgun or single shot (sharps rifle) instead. Mod above makes it much easier to get them. Instead of wiping out group of enemies in almost no time it changes the fight in one-by-one, man-to-man miniduels. Switch to revolver, when ambushed by group of bad boys in small space - thats what they are for.\n\nWIN7 and higher:\nALMOST impossible to play. On Win7 x64 Ultimate it crashes within minutes of the gameplay and not only crashes - it completely shuts down my computer. I have no idea what about older systems, but the new ones are doomed.\nI have tryed every solution, I have found - compatibility modes, sound changes etc. - to no effect.\n\nConclusion:\nA) If you have PC with older OS, it may be game for you - I enjoyed it a lot.\nB) If you have more up-to-date system, think twice, whether you are willing to buy, install and try something, that has high chances to never work for you.","December 28, 2014","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here's the pros and cons for you, just to make it a little simpler.\n\nPROS:\n-Fantastic atmosphere and setting. I personally love the Old West, and this only amplified that love. From the cutscenes to the running-and-gunning, to simply staring at the scenery, the game perfectly captures that old school cowboy vibe many games fail to achieve.\n-Incredible story. It seems simple at first, two brothers, on a trail of vengeance and glory, but the narrative, and a stellar performance from the cast, send this story soaring, even to it's heart-breaking (if slightly predictable) ending.\n-Solid, entertaining combat. There's not a ton of weapons to choose from, but hot damn if they're not fun to shoot, especially in the games many set piece combat areas.\n-Great level design. The levels make great use of height ad cover to provide some truly entertaining shooting action.All but a few of the levels are fairly linear, but that handful of non-linear levels show the possibility to make an incredible open world CoJ, with detailed environments, plenty of side-quests, and a great sense of scope.\n-Stellar multiplayer. Sadly, the community is no longer active, but Bound by Blood had some truly spectacular multiplayer. The controls carried over from the campaign quite well, and the map design made for some fun and frantic action.\n\nCONS:\n-Runtime. The game is too damn short. I mean, it has a reasonable runtime, but still, it's so great, I easily could've sunk another 10 hours into the singleplayer if it was there.\n\nSo there you have it, a truly fantastic game with a great story, awesome combat, a spectacular atmosphere, and some sadly under rated multiplayer to boot.\n\n9.5/10","July 25, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics are still nice,particularly If you can tweak it in your graphics control panel\n. At the start of each act,you can choose which of the 2 brothers you wish to play as,each with slightly different weapons and approaches\n. Good amount/variation of weapons that feel satisfying when used to get a kill (also get to use a canon and gatling gun)\n. Different surroundings and settings which are fitting of each scenario\n. Great story,with a good twist\n. Fun gameplay once you get the hang of it,different mechanics like cover,slow-mo's and duels\n. A nice addition of side missions in a limited free roam setting in between the main campaign that I wasn't expecting,but was welcome\n. Voice acting isn't professional,some voices don't suit or are lacking enough emotion,but still acceptable\n. Short campaign,but I think that it was the perfect length as any more may have dragged on and got boring\n. AI is mostly good,darting/ducking about all over the place,but you do get a random straggler moving randomly or not doing much at all\n\nI strongly recommend playing it at easy on your first playthrough,and thats mainly because of the duels and other play variations. The first time I played this (offline),I was stuck on the 3rd duel,and could not pass it no matter how hard I tried. It sort of ruined the game and I put it down for over a year before picking it up again (no online save either). 2nd time around I played it on easy and while I cruised through it (a few deaths on each of the duels),I feel I'd have much better chance of beating them on a higher difficulty now. It will also give you a better chance of getting used to the cover and slow-mo mechanics,whilst immersing yourself in the story and theme.","March 9, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All the guns, buildings, attires, accents and entities are expertly recreated. The graphics are the breakthrough variety that helped inspire games like Crysis 2 and Far Cry 3. The gameplay is top notch. Concentration mode is improved upon from the previous Call of Juarez and lets the game perform the shooting once you've picked out the targets with Ray, or use  the mouse properly with Thomas.\n\nIn terms of story, Bound in Blood delivers a compelling adventure, a riveting quest for glory and restoration mixed with greed and betrayal. A little short and the end could have been extended, but a game worth the both the money and the effort needed to play it.\n\nHowever, history buffs, beware, the Colt single action army  used in the game hadn't been invented yet, nor had the Winchester model you see in the game. Bound in Blood is somewhat inaccurate in terms of time period weapons, but they're well designed, nonetheless.","December 21, 2013","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The flipped cutscenes only effect the titlescreen and the backgrounds of the main menu. Every cutscene in-game is right side up.\n\nMy thoughts: Call Of Juarez "Bound in Blood"So i finally completed the game (well, atleast 1 playthrough mostly as Ray, with a bit of Thomas mixed in. May or may not do a full Thomas run. Regardless i feel iv played enough to review!\n\nHeres a quick rundown of my overall opinions.\n[What i loved]\n-Story, while not super great, is still fun to follow from start to the end.\n-2 diffrent charecters with slightly diffrent playstyles (enought to warrent atleast 1 more playthrough).\n-Map layout is decently varied and not as liniar as what was seen in "Call of Juarez: Gunslinger".\n-Overall gamelength is LONGER then Gunslinger (this is actually kind of important).\n-The few quicktime-esq moments the game forces on you (usually is a forced  "concentration" mode for a few seconds) are simple, but still amusing when you start racking up combos.\n-Guns, while limited based on the "old west" setting, are still fun to use and the game makes up for its lack with diffrent gun "conditions" that add improved stats or give reduced.\n\nWhat i disliked\n-The duels with certan charecters (pretty much this game's boss fights) are the weakest aspect. You eather love them or hate them, or get stuck on them if your reaction time sucks.\n-The lack of that quick, arcade style gameplay is a bit dissapointing, and results in a sometime very slow feeling game, especally if you'v played Gunslinger before this**\n-Concentration mode isn't handled as well as in Gunslinger, instead of keeping any concentration time you have left, you have 60 seconds to use it all before the bar gets auto-drained half way (and you need to kill a bit more to fill it up again for another use)**\n-The map design can be a bit weird a times, granted its varied but certan sections can feel a bit un-neccesary,\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Yes, i have played Gunslinger before this. I feel playing a later game in the series and then going back to this resulted in me being used to Gunslingers improved mechanics (like how concentration is handled) and taking a step back made certan aspects feel weird to me. Take the "dislike" section with a grain of salt and judge for yourself\n\nOverall..."Call of Juarez: Bood in Blood" is a decent game for the price you pay. It's nothing groundbreaking but if you enjoy the Call of Juarez series, or something a little abouve the casual fps game, you can't go wrong with it. It has a fair share of bugs, (from what iv heard atleast, fortunatly my playthrough was reletivly bugfree, i only needed to force kill my game once) and occasinal wonky mechanics may throw people away a tad, but at its heart its an enjoyable old-west take on the fps genre.\n\nScore6.5/10 Stars\n"Not groundbreaking, but check it out"","November 2, 2015","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll explain more and go into more detail at the bottom of this review, but that will be with a spoilder warning\n\ncons:\n-Really senstive mouse (perhaps I just am just not use to shooters as much as I use to be, but it was really senstive to me I had to turn my senstivity down.)\n-Plot holes in story.\n-AI buddies aren't the best\n-The two characters you can choose from doesn't seem all that different, at least to me.\n-Grahpics seem a bit weird, perhaps it's just an older game and I am use the grahpics in the next game.\n\nPros:\n-Great gameplay (Once you get use to the senstivity)\n-Despite the plot hole and the bad ending, I really started to want ot see the end of the game by the time I got into it.\n-Interesting character interraction in the game. Like if you do good your brother in the game will comment on that. I wish there were more of that, more lines for htem to say, but it was interesting none the less.\n-Characters do feel like they could be real and they all have their own, unique personality.\n-Interesting time period feeling. You get the feeling you really are in the old wild west.\n-Inbetween big missions, you get to go intoa little area and explore like red dead redemption and earn money, it is by far one my favorite things about the game.\n\n\nOverall rating 6.5/10\n\n\nSPOILER ALERT!:\nDuring the very ending of the game, Ray, the eldest brother, becomes a priest. Now this guy, throughout the entire game, is the most brutal character. In some cases, he is more brutal than the guys you are fighting. Throughout the game you get a feel of his personality, he shouldn't have been made into a priest. He doesn't even look the part. The biggest problem and I mean the BIGGEST problem is the moment when the brothers meet at the end. This is after Rick, the middle brother, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing left your â¥â¥â¥ and your little brother (Albeit he thought he was dead, but that is only because of that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ he fell in love with.) to die. He left you guys to die and the first thing rick is going to say is "i told you what would happen if you took another girl from me, brother.". NO! What he should say is "Why did you leave me to die you sum â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥." I wanted him there to be more conflict. What I wanted is RIck to say that he would never leave his brother to die, not even for a woman. But that didn't happen, it went back to the woman. I mean the girl doesn't even have good personality, i don't really like her, she is least favorite character. You would think william might say something too, like "I forgive you", considering he is a priest and wouldn't get mad. I wanted more conflict than that. And what the helli s with running river letting the guy that killed his son go? WHY! that was never explained, the most we get is when the former confederate general said "I guess god wanted it to happen" or some â¥â¥â¥â¥ like that. I didn't like it.","February 29","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Glad to say, this is one of them.\n\nSound- Voices sound like they were recorded with a potato, yet the gunshots are crisp. Explosions look flat, though dynamite and oil lamps scattered around the environment are effective enough. This is a western, though- the focus is on the gunplay.\n\nGunplay- Just a touch tricky with some of the special moves, but once you get the hang of it you're damn near unstoppable playing as one of two brothers- Thomas, the sneaky and lithe long ranged specialist with knives and a bow, or as Ray, the guns-blazing, dual weilding muscle bound â¥â¥â¥ kicker. The game rarely limits your approach as far as what weapons you're actually allowed to utilize- as Ray I often found myself picking off people with a long rifle, and with Thomas I've blown away many an outlaw with a double barrel- the differences lie in how you utilize these weapons, and also, what perspective you experience the story from.\n\nThe Story- It's well written and engaging as any good western should be- not reinventing the wheel by any means, but satisfying to see unfold- and given the different perspectives of each brother through these missions, it's worth a second go just to see what exactly is going on when the other brother is out of sight. How you determine the quality of the ending and how everything get's tied together will ultimately be a rather subjective thing, but I personally enjoyed it.\n\nI can't speak for the multiplayer- I haven't tried it, but there's a community however small it may be dedicated to keeping it alive, so it must have some merit.\n\nIf you're new to western themed games but enjoy first person shooters heavily focused on story and gameplay, definitely give this one a whirl- if you're already a fan of such things, don't even wait for it to go on sale like I did, ten bucks is already a steal, minor little quirks and flaws be damned.","May 19","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
