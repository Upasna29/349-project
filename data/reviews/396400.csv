You get to create your own ghoul at the start and be the new ghoul in school. Making friends, doing quests, finding hidden objects around the school and/or in lockers are just some of the tasks you encounter. The environment is both rich in colour and beautiful. Achievements obtainable + trading cards included. Great game for the little ones or even yourself if you are a fan of the Monster High series or just a kid at heart. Highly recommended.","December 23, 2015","true","9.0"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","26","31","8","2"

It is a game made for young kids so of course it is going to be dull for an older person. You go to and fro and give things to people and find secrets. It's like a kid's first well rounded game. Anyone would enjoy it if you liked Monster High.","February 7","true","10.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","0"

Just from the look and feel, I'm calling it MLP meets Harry Potter, but with the horror genre.  Personally, I love almost any game where I can customize a character for my avatar.  It's what made me like THUG, and Tiger Woods PGA.  So, this game starts out with that plus.  You can choose from a very large variety of monsters to be your main character.  Then you get to pick clothes (and you can buy more outfits in game) and hair-style so you can be as unique as you want to be.\n\nThe game is controller-supported, which is great.  It reminds me a lot of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone on the PlayStation.  I haven't played too much, but you walk around school and can talk to people, and there are collectibles scattered all around for you to find, encouraging you to explore.  In addition, you can find Locker Codes scribbled on the wall to open old lockers in the hallways.  You don't even have to worry about writing them down.  They are saved in your phone, and exclamation points are placed above the lockers you found the codes for!\n\nThe graphics are smooth, and aside from a couple times when I jumped down and glitched into a box, forcing me to reset my game, everything flows well.  The atmosphere is nice, and I really dig the spooky dance-beat (probably based on the show's title music) playing in the background.\n\nSome characters (possibly main characters?  Again, I have never seen the show to know anyone yet.) are voice-acted, and the game-makers picked good people, I think.  If you like the horror genre, and exploration/adventure games where you go on fetch-quests, and you don't mind the setting of a school and being a female, talking about monster fashion, this is a great game.  I don't think the point is story so much as just being a part of the Monster High world as a character of your own.  As a male, I am not ashamed of playing this game.","January 22","true","12.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","10","11","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paragus/recommended/396400/","paragus","Paragus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paragus/","180 products in account","This entire game is talking to people with poorly written lines, and having these people send you on fetch quests down the hall.  Every 30 mins or so there might be something that almost resembles gameplay in the form of a poorly designed mini game...maybe.  It's barely a game since there is no real gameplay, it's like a bad visual novel with a terrible camera that never points the way you want it to and gives you motion sickness.  Everyone is the story is some sort of undead, and you'll be wishing that whenever they died that they would have stayed that way.","December 23, 2015","false","1.8"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","59","26","44","9","0"

I actually enjoy the Monster High cartoons for their terrible, terrible, monster-related puns, and the creative designs of the characters. This game is much the same, only this time, you get to be part of it, as the eponymous "New Ghoul."\n\nPros:\nSimple gameplay for younger gamers.\nEverything is pretty child-friendly, but adults will (mostly unironically) enjoy it as well\nVoice acting of some of the main characters in the show\nDraculaura's Voice isn't as pitch shifted as usual, which is a blessing\nFamiliar mechanics (I'll talk about this soon)\n\nCons:\nGame-crashing glitch can be encountered with the iCoffin's 'Feed' function.\nThere are only a dozen or so characters voice acted, and even then, they don't sound right.\nA very small soundtrack, while the songs aren't terrible, they do loop, seemingly endlessly.\nNone of the newer characters appear in the game, nor are they likely to ever be. (Luna Mothews being the one I missed seeing)\nThe game tries to be modern and trendy for the kids, but introduces some of the worst trends, like their 'Feed' AKA Twitter.\nCan only play as a girl, Mattel is kind of behind while at the same time trying to be current...\nMaybe too liberally copying a certain game that also has a female protagonist. (I'll talk about this soon.)\n\nOK, so you've bought this game, now you get to join the characters of the show and fashion doll line, Monster High, where who you are is more important than what you are. Sounds good, good message for the kids.\n\nEnjoyment of this game quickly comes once I started just exploring, moving boxes, climbing ledges, and that's when it dawns on me that I've played this game before. It's Tomb Raider. Not the new Tomb Raider nee Uncharted, more like Tomb Raider: Anniversary. I swear, I want to find out what physics engine this game is using, because the characters move exactly the same. It's like playing TR:A only they took out the health and combat functions. As a gamer this is interesting, but maybe one day, Monster High will be my hypothetical daughter's gateway into playing Tomb Raider games.\n\nAs far as features go, this game comes fully loaded with Controller Support, achievements, and trading cards, though its menues leave something to be desired. It's not the absolute worst console port that I own by a long shot, and that has to count for something.\n\nIt's not 'so bad it's good' or mediocre, it's actually surprisingly good among a tier of games that you don't actually expect to be any good whatsoever. Sure, it  can't compete with AAA games, or their biggest business rival, Lego, but this is a gem, you know, by Mattel standards.\n\nFindal Verdict: Buy it, if only for your kids.\n6.5/10 - While a long ways from perfect, and showing of Mattel's status as second banana to Lego in terms of quality, this still provides some entertainment, if only for the terrible, terrible monster puns, and the familiar Tomb Raider-esque gameplay.","February 22","true","9.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It runs smooth and without any fps drops. The Graphics itself are very colourful, bright and cartoony. The Actual Story will take you 10 hours to go through and the story itself is rather rich and amazing.\n\nThe Game itself takes place in the Monster High World which is a Webispode Show and popular mostly among the younger audience. The Controls are also very easy, especially with a controller.\n\nYou will be able to costumize not only your clothes but your hair and with it your hair colour as well. Each haircut is provided with 2 differen colours. Via your iCoffin you will be able to buy even more clothes which lets you in the end create your own specific look.\n\nAll in all I can recommend this game especially for kids, if you are older than the age of 14 and you are not into Barbie or Disney or anything similiar I do not recommend you to get this game as you might think it is boring.\n\nI also recommend this game for every achievement hunter as it is rather easy to get this a perfect game, also another + in my opinion is, this is the first game with actual achievements and trading cards.\n\nDue to the fact that this Game is 10 hours long (or longer if you want to get all the extras) I can recommend it for its original price of 20€ but of course it is never a mistake to get it for cheaper as well.\n\nThis Game is by far one of the best Kid-games on Steam and I hope in the future there will be more such great games!","January 11","true","19.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","7","10","4","0"

This game is rather reminicient of games such as Bratz: Forever Diamondz in how the character moves and interacts, as well as the phone mechanic for tracking objectives and other things. I'd highly reccomend using a controller for this game however; since the camera controls are extremely difficult to get over without it. If at all possible, I'd also reccomend turning down your controller sensitivity, as the movement controls are very sensitive and could cause a lot of annoyance in the platforming puzzles.","March 8","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My computer has played much higher frame rate games and i have a pretty good system. Maybe this game would work better in it's console versions. Just be wary.

Also the physics, not just a little janky, but making objects the move milimeters at a time is just bad.\nI think this game may in fact have been programmed BY high school students, or less, and thats a shame as it looks pretty good for being a cartoon based game.\nI would like to see more deveopment for Monster High games, but the quality *MUST* improve, as this was dreadful.","March 6","false","3.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
