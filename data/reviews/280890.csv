I give up, I don't think Ghostship Aftermath can be fixed to a playable state.  There are more issues being introduced than fixed.  I'm actually not certain that any of the issues I've logged have been addressed with anything other than condescenion or censor (screenshots of deleted threads below).\n\nThis game is extraordinarily broken both technically and gameplay-wise Avoid. /edit>\n\n<edit - response to developers comments:\nI'm glad you're still taking the time to respond, not a lot of developers do.  However you must remember I'm not a developer on Ghostship Aftermath and that I have no vested interest in seeing it succeed.  I have no desire to see it fail either - I do like the idea and want to play it.\n\nPushing work out to the community is not going to garner the responses you'd like because you're going to be asked why - having paid for a product - must we now help fix it?\n\nConsider your comment "confirm any Current issues in your review".  That's a lot of work.  I don't want to spend hours reproducing the issues in my review - having been a professional game tester I'm well aware that that can be an arduous process.  The onus is on you - who sold me the product - to tell me exactly which issues have been fixed and the circumstances for which they've been fixed.\n\nUnfortunately the 1.1 update broke mouse inversion and at this is the point I edited my review to "I give up".  I hate playing with an un-inverted mouse.  Nevertheless I still played for about an hour more but noticed nothing obviously resolved.\n\nAs it stands I believe my review is still current but that it's not my job to discover when it's not. /edit>\n\n\n\nFirst off, I actually quite like Ghostship Aftermath but I'm giving it a thumbs down because it's been released too early.\n\nKenuty's review is pretty accurate and you should read it.  However for those - like myself - with shorter attention spans I'm going to briefly summarise the issues I had <edit - this has since become a fairly sizeable list, I've removed the suggested fixes to the Bug Reports pages as asked however as those bug reports have since been deleted you'll have to follow the imgur links to find them:\nTechnical issues  Image[i.imgur.com]\nGame-play issues  Image[i.imgur.com]\nMinor issues  Image[i.imgur.com]/edit>\n\n\n* View clips outside of the ship when jumping.\n\n* Couldn't go down a ramp in zero-gravity.\n\n* Stuck in the Storage A door and had to restart.\n\n* The screen jitters and jerks when I walk into objects.\n\n* 'F' for sprint?  And 'L' for light is hard to reach.\n\n* Escape ends the game without warning.\n\n* The players view 'sticks' when verically centered.\n\n* Stuck in HQ Window and had restart the checkpoint.\n\n* The lights stobe so fast I thought it was z-fighting.\n\n* Climbing stairs happens in nausea inducing hops.\n\n* I've never been able to change weapons.\n\n* Crouching doesn't seem to affect the players viewpoint.\n\n* Couldn't fire weapon after simulation stage.\n\n* Helmet light illuminates objects erratically.\n\n* Corpse shadows are cast where there are no corpses.\n\n* There is no pause button.\n\n* The map is too zomed in\n\n* Motion blurs the HUD even though it's relatively not moving.\n\n* It's not readily apparent what options are selected.\n\n* Controls locked up after dying including 'esacpe'.\n\n* Game crashes on exit.\n\n* Simulation door only half-opened once.\n\n* Reloading caused view to tilt right permanently once.\n\n* Helment light is pushed 'though' surfaces.\n\n* z-fighting in the intro movie.\n\n* Cold storage airlock wouldn't activate though online.\n\n* Resuming game after immiediately kills you again.\n\n* Stuck in a corpses head and had to restart.\n\n* Jumping forward causes the sprint bob animation.\n\n* Enemies can get stuck in doors and on boxes\n\n* Enemies sometimes attack when too far away.\n\n* Gun fires at a downward angle no matter where I aim.\n\n* Can no longer invert the mouse.\n\n* Some aliens seem to take no damage.\n\n* Intro cannot be skipped when starting a new game.\n\n* Alien animation 'snaps' between frames.\n\n\nI did think fairly hard about whether or not I should have posted this as a review or in the forums; but finally decided that the issues are big enough that someone considering buying Ghostship Aftermath should know about them.","July 19, 2014","false","6.7"," 286 of 378 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","286","378","2","33"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKaein/recommended/280890/","TheKaein","Kaein","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKaein/","116 products in account","UPDATE: I played the game again and to see if there were any changes and was killed twice in utterly nonsense ways. Once by a noclipping stiffy mode zombie and another time because aliens and zombies dropped through a solid ceiling to land on top of me and swarmed me\n\nPros:\n*Solid Atmosphere\n\nThe sounds of metal creaking and the quiet breathing of your character as he runs is very intense and can give you a deep sense of immersion when nothing else is going on. You find yourself checking corners and worrying when the next enemy will pop up. Sounds will echo throughout the ship and have you looking around wondering what could possibly be doing that. Sometimes the ship will make no sounds and the silence itself then becomes eerie. Very well done.\n\n*Innovative Design\n\nThe whole "No playthrough is the same" concept is really really cool. My first playthrough the ship's AI was very helpful and gave me weapons, warnings, and helped me detect enemies. My second playthrough the ship's AI was deranged and crazy and barred my way. My third playthrough the AI was completely dead and I had to go through the whole ship with no backup power or systems and many areas were closed off. That is just one storyline aspect that changes the game. There are hundreds of those kinds of things that make each playthrough unique and throw you curveballs as to what you expect.\n\n*Interesting Weapons\n\nOkay so you have your standard rifles, pistols, and submachine guns. But with the fact that some weapons can replenish their ammo supply infinitely but take a long time to charge, and some weapons can reload fast, but magazines are limited, really changes the game. If you get down to a laser rifle and no other weapon you can probably do okay against a small group, but a large group could easily kill you because it only holds 80 shots and then it takes about 2 minutes to recharge. Minutes you really don't have. This really ramps up the difficulty and intensity of the game when the going gets rough and can make you have to strategize on the fly.\n\n*Decent Story\n\nOkay so I know the story changes based on how the playthrough goes, but I really got into it when I started finding out why the ship was infested. Knowing what I know in one storyline adds a huge sidelight to the others, and makes the storyline fairly intriguing.\n\nAlright now time for the cons. =(\n\nCons:\n*Erratic Controls\n\nThey say it is controller compatible, but they kind of lie. The controller works, sure, but sometimes it won't sprint on controller anymore after certain storyline events. Sometimes your aim gets twitchy and wierd and you can't really lock on an enemy because your gun sight aims too far right if you even slightly tap right and too far left if you even slightly tap left basically forcing you to use the mouse and keyboard. Even after I switched I found it clunky and difficult to hit enemies even when they were right in front of me. Not good guys. This is 90% of the reason I died every time I did. Oh yeah and invert Y turns on when it wants. You don't get a choice in the matter.\n\n*Little to no Graphics settings\n\nIts okay to make a polished game and all and I've got a decent computer, but I'm the type that will turn down the graphics even if I CAN run it on the best just so I can crank out a little bit more FPS. Thats kind of important to me, and I'm certain it would be more important to someone who is using a potato computer. The fact that you only have 2 resolutions, little to no particle effects options, and absolutely no bloom or dynamic lighting options really limits how people can customize their graphics to suit the game. Which leads me to my next point\n\n*NEEDS to be optimized\n\nAlright, they are trying to make it look pretty but fact is that the graphics in this game are decent at best. But hey, its an indie game. Whatever gets the job done works you know? But come on guys, I can run Planetside 2 on high graphics with no lag and the same deal with Bioshock Infinite, Rage, Far Cry, ect. So I can play some games with high graphics and have little to no lag. Yet your game with meh graphics lags like a tired horse in a caravan the moment a large group of enemies shows up. This is rather irritating and can easily get you killed as that is the WORST time for the game to lag. I don't need pretty, I need playable. That is what is MOST important about a game and needs to be put on a higher priority.\n\n*Enemies move in glitchy movements, sometimes slide on surfaces.\n\nI was fighting some aliens and I jumped over some boxes and kept running. What does the alien do? It flips sideways in the air and slides THROUGH me to land in front of me and kill me. Um. What?\nYeah that kind of garbage shouldn't happen. Its one thing if an alien crawls on the roof all scary like to jump in front or something like that. However, unless the alien is also a ghost, it shouldn't be phasing through objects and people. Many times aliens would appear out of an area I just cleared through the floor or something and attack and left me wondering wtf just happened. I died early game my first run because of that floor effect. Very frustrating I assure you. Especially when the enemies get trapped in the floor and run around underneath the map freaking you out by making attack sounds, which leads me to my next point.\n\n*Wierd glitched sound FX\n\nI killed some zombies and expected the sounds of them attacking to end. Nope. Kept hearing moaning all throughout Deck 4 until I left which made it hard to detect when other zombies attempted to attack me because I couldn't hear them. Sometimes enemies will make no noise and instead just soundlessly attack me while I shoot at them. Sometimes my guns would make no noise. Occasionally both gun and enemy sounds would be delayed and would happen all at once after I killed the last one. Yeah it was wierd and kinda broke the immersion. A game based on atmosphere needs sound to be top notch in order to really keep the player into the game.\n\n*Terrible, TERRIBLE voice acting\n\nLook, I know this is an indie title but there are plenty of talented voice actors out there. I've done voice acting work before, as have many of the people on newgrounds who are hurting for recognition and I'm absolutely certain you could find a guy who would be willing to work for free just to have his name out there. This guy you hired to be the foil for the main character is not an actor. As a matter of fact I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume he is a programmer who just is doing it because you guys needed one.\nWhen you first enter the ship he laughs this awful fake laugh like a million times that reminds me of Tommy Wiseau from The Room (Nothing should EVER remind me of that) and his line reading is both annoying and without much emotion or tone. The character he plays isn't much better considering he makes fun of you being in danger constantly and it made me want to hit him. I'm always happy when he shuts up even when he is giving me pertinent information because his false emotion and wooden acting hurt my ears to listen to.\n\nHowever, I will concede you this. I don't know if the AI is a programmed voice or a real person simulating one, but she is actually okay. She seems as robotic as she is supposed to be. Thats good. She isn't bad to listen to and whenever she gave me orders I was okay with listening to them, mostly because I didn't want to roll my eyes whenever her vocals played.\n\n_-_-_-_-_-_\n\nSo overall this game has some very good ideas and would have potential if there weren't so many things that hold it back. I wish you guys spent a lot more time fixing bugs on this game and making it playable, reducing clunkiness, and making the game have more actual gameplay to give you. If someone is looking to purchase this game, I'd reccomend they wait until version 2.0+ is out and then see where the game stands. Until then, this isn't really worth 12 bucks.","November 22, 2014","false","1.7"," 83 of 92 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","83","92","0","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/280890/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","This is one of the most interesting indie games I've come across in my Steam adventures. It's very clearly a passion project that pushes some major boundaries, but also suffers for its ambition. Strap in 'cause I'm going over this one in meticulous detail. It deserves the attention.\n\nGhostship Aftermath is the story of a two-man crew that comes across a huge derelict spaceship in the middle of nowhere. You are the adventurous one, donning a bulky spacesuit and delving into the ship only to very quickly discover that things have gone terribly wrong. Your partner stays behind to guide you in his impossibly snarky way, but is soon cut off by the ship's AI who warns you that your partner may not be who you think they are. Your job, then, is to survive the perils of the derelict while siding with either the man or machine to bring an end to the deadly infestation aboard. It's an interesting premise, and feels heavily informed by 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nThe ship itself is a labyrinthine mess of halls and hatches. Much of it is locked down in the wake of the disaster that left it drifting, but it is so huge that the parts still open feel overwhelming. The ship is split into four sections, each with seven decks and plenty of elevators, stairs, and sublevels between them. Here the game feels like an open-world System Shock, with armories and medbays and cargo holds and engineering compartments to explore. Fortunately your allies provide you verbal guidance to your objectives, which you REALLY need to pay attention to because it is quite easy to get lost.\n\nThere's a remarkable level of detail in parts of the ship, as well. The halls and chambers can get a bit samey, but smaller elements like debris and signage are worth paying attention to. Of particular note are the computer displays around the ship, which ALWAYS feature readable information. I'm not sure how useful any of it is, but it's a fantastic addition. You also experience the entire game through your suit, which has a HUD reminiscent of the cockpit in Descent. It's a little distracting, but once you get used to the size and locations of useful info it's good for immersion.\n\nOnce you get the AI switched back on and the ship warms up, you find out this has roused the monsters that killed the crew as well. You're directed to a weapon which is effective but has VERY little ammo available. While combat is an option, you really need to run from what you can and save your shots for the things you CAN'T run from. I encountered three kinds of enemies as I played. One was slow but prevalent, easy to escape but I always had to be on the lookout for. Another was small and fast but easy to dispatch. And the third was quick and dangerous and had to be dealt with before it tore me apart. The creatures are scattered around the ship, just common enough to keep you on edge every time you turn a corner. I had a fantastic experience after I grabbed the weapon and was moving to another part of the ship. As I got to the airlock to the next section, I heard some kind of creature behind me. I ran and triggered the doors, and when I turned to look I saw the shadows of something lumbering down the hall. The airlock shut just as they were about to cross the threshold. The whole thing gave me shivers.\n\nAll of this combines into a package that should rival the likes of Alien: Isolation... A huge open ship, a variety of monsters roaming the decks, NPCs you can't fully trust, and an atmospheric, immersive environment. And maybe if it was made by a AAA studio it would have been. But as I said, this was very clearly a passion project, and in this case that sadly takes more from the game than it adds.\n\nThe game's engine is terrible. There's really no getting around this one, I'm afraid. It looks good to be sure, but everything outside the graphical polish is clunky to the point of being unworkable. The first warning sign was the options. Instead of a menu, it is a QUESTIONNAIRE, to be completed one option at a time. You can only pick one of two resolutions, neither of which were optimal for my display (1680x1050). Furthermore, the controls cannot be rebound. If you want to change something that isn't on the quiz, you're out of luck, and anytime you want to change one of those options you have to go back through and make all your choices again.\n\nWithin the game, movement is the biggest problem. I know you're supposed to be in a clunky space suit and all, but this ship is HUGE and you tromp around at less than human walking speed. There is a sprint but you run out of stamina quickly and the view shakes so much that I literally got motion sick and had to stop playing. It's surprisingly easy to get hung up on geometry, and walking over debris on the floor can make you pop into the air or wiggle up and down like the game doesn't know where to settle you. The worst part is that this can affect the monsters as well, killing any sort of horror or tension they impart. Remember I mentioned a quick, deadly enemy that attacked me? The first time it pounced at me, it got stuck in the wall and stayed there for a whole 30 seconds, swinging at me impotently until it dislodged itself. All the terror I felt when it first attacked evaporated instantly.\n\nThere are other annoyances, like strangely sticky mouse controls that slow way down as you move the view across eye level. Your weapon has a fixed aim at a point that is NOT the center of the screen and that you have to hold RMB to display the actual reticule for. There's no indication of what items can be picked up and interacted with, which can lead to some serious DOOM-style-secret-door-hunting wall humping. The writing is extremely amateurish and the voiceovers do it no favors, taking a lot of wind out of the interesting setup between your partner and the AI (the AI isn't bad though, having a cold, mechanical delivery to very clinical lines).\n\nBut perhaps most damning of all is how the huge, open-world nature of the game actually works against itself. For as huge and detailed as the ship is, you're stuck traipsing through it at a snail's pace, struggling to remember where you're going or figuring out how to get there, and desperately looking for things to interact with because they are few and far between. Your first task for the AI is to get one of the ship's reactors online. If you take the most direct route, you discover that the stairs in the Engineering section are blocked and you have to backtrack to another section to get into the sublevel access. This is after walking the length of the ship and waiting through 3-4 loading screens as you traverse each section. There are entirely too many loading screens as you play, having to sit through one every time you move between sections, decks, or key areas. I think there's something like 4 load screens just getting from your ship to the derelict in the intro, where all you do is put on your suit and exit the airlock.\n\nI honestly wish this was a better game. I think there's a good game in here, buried under a bad engine and suspect design choices. But this goes beyond something like The Witcher 1 or the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R., where a little patience will reward you with a deep and fascinating game. I just can't imagine putting the time in to learn the lay of the ship and how to deal with all the janky creatures. Not when Alien: Isolation hits all the same notes and does them so much better.","September 18, 2015","false","0.5"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","40","44","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/likeucare/recommended/280890/","likeucare","LIKEUCARE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/likeucare/","1377 products in account","So what is Ghostship Aftermath?\n\nIt is basically somekind of a mix between the good old System Shock 2 and Dead Space. You play as some "dude" that has to board a ship where something "good"? has happened. Oh I meant bad! Its always something bad happening! So once you do board, you gotta follow some directives from you partner and not long after, you get cutoff from him and some A.I. takes over the coms and directs you to a list of objectives. It all seems cool doesn't?\n\nI'll sum up the pros and cons so you can get a better overview and decide for yourself whether or not to get this game.\n\n\nPROS:\n+Solid Atmosphere (ships noise reminiscent of System Shock 2)\n+Cool Design concept (This is where the game shines the most: Every playthrough is different. At one pt, the A.I. can be helpful, the next pt it hinders your progress and on another pt, it can even be dead so you're all alone trying to figure out what to do).\n+Infinity ammo for weapons but takes time to recharge\n+Story is predictable but serviceable nonetheless. Some elements do change between each playthrough which keeps things interesting.\n+Price drop of the game. Kudos to the devs 'cause when I got this game, it was very overpriced.\n\nCONS:\n-Technical glitches (it says on the game page that this game release many patches concerning the pletora of bugs and glitches but it is still infested by them. On instances, I kept getting stucked on items and couldn't move. I saw enemies going through walls also.\n-Truly bad controls and aiming mecanism is very flawed (THIS IS MY MAIN GRIPE OVER THIS GAME: The aiming is very pathetic. Even when an enemy is right in front of you and aim at the head, you're missing the target anyway).\n-False controller support (It's mentioned that the is controller compatible, but they kind of lie. The controller works, sure, but sometimes it won't sprint on controller anymore after certain scripted event).\n-Weak graphical settings (Little to no graphical options. Only two resolutions available. No eye candy as you are used to in any modern games. Can't even change game settings when in-game. Also the visuals are quite bad, even on their aleged graphical patch. I know this is an indie game and its easy to pick negatively at the graphics. But honestly, the graphics could have really been more improved. At least, the game was playable on my end, compared to other gamers that seemed to have difficulty running the game).\n-Auto save only. Can't save the game manually.\n-Zombie sound glitch that can still be heard after you killed the zombie. Only way to make it stop was to quit and reload the game.\n-Same enemies throughout the whole game. Same twitchy movements and even walk/crawl through walls.\n-Mostly average and at times, terrible voice acting. (Granted this is an indie game but whoa, at times, it was really awful; especially the voice of your ally. The A.I. is quite fine by me though. It actually sounds like a computerized AI voice! Surely doesn't sound like SHODAN but it is decent!).\n\n\nOVERALL:\nThis game has a good concept and some very good ideas. Sadly, many things hold it back. It is still a commendable work the developers did on this project and hopefully you guys can only improve on a potential sequel. I truly wish you up your game next time, especially on the glitches, bugs, voice acting and my biggest irritant, the poor aiming mechanism. The graphics can always get better and hopefully on a potential sequel, they'll be more optimized and up-to-date to modern gaming standards.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nI can't reccommend this game at this time. Cool concept but marred with inconsistencies, bugs and glitches. I did read on the reviews section of this game store page that Ghostship Aftermath did improved on the glitches and bugs so that is something to keep in mind. The devs are working on their project and that is noteworthy. Sadly, the game lost my attention with all the numerous cons I've mentioned earlier. The game did got a price drop recently but even so, I still wouldn't advise anyone to get this game. Wait up for a potential sequel when aspects of this game should (hopefully) be fixed by then.\n\nRATING:\n5.0 / 10\n\nPS. I do not own any VR equipment at the moment so I cannot comment on that matter here.","January 18, 2015","false","1.1"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","23","29","2","2"

Yes, the game has flaws.\n\nThe game is clunky in areas, a little loading screen heavy, some of the choices are questionable (totally silent enemies bum rushing you from behind with the only warning being a big chunk of your ♥♥♥♥ missing), moving around can be a little difficult.\n\nNo, this game isn't going to be Deadspace or System Shock 2. It was cobbled together by a single person who had nothing but fumes for funding, and holy ♥♥♥♥ is it impressive for that. Not just impressive, but ambitious.\n\nI feel that most of the negative opinions are falling prey to two things. Firstly the game's rather odd graphics, it's designed for VR, and holy hell does it look good in that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9twokPQuFQ - but it looks a little blocky in a traditional display. Secondly, the absolutely brutal difficulty curve. This game starts off at 9 and ramps things upto 11 pretty quickly, and doesn't bother to explain anything along the way. If you're looking for something which will scare you but not even remotely challenge you along the way, this is definitely not the game. My opinion in this regard is backed up by the fact that most (not all) negative reviews have very little playtime. An hour, tops.\n\nAnyway, in short I feel people are walking into this game with the wrong expectations. The guy who made this game (solo) could have made a godly 2d / side scroller / what have you with how dedicated and driven he is, but he didn't sell himself short and went for the gold instead and made the game he wanted to make. The result is spectacular but not without flaws, though given the origins it's extraordinary.\n\n.. Honestly though, your partner's V.O. is god awful. There's absolutely no justification for how badly delivered the lines are. I feel that improving that would be one of the best things that could be done.

The game reminds me of System Shock which is no bad thing at all. Each run through the Goliath is different due to the randomization of story elements and encounters which takes the sting of perma-death away somewhat. The sounds and lighting are spot on for how i imagine a spooky derelict to be and i really am conflicted between exploring and staying safe.\n\nHowever there is still work ahead. The game is playable enough but it doesn't feel smooth and polished yet, which is to be expected. I still bob up and down when climbing stairs, you still judder against some smaller objects and i have been trapped between a strut and a shelf in one of the storerooms requiring a restart but the list of bugs and annoyances has shrank something fierce in the latest round of patches. I would like a way to push myself back to the deck in Zero-G areas as i was stuck floating against the ceiling in one room in Engineering and Crouch just seems to wibble the camera a little too rather than actually crouching.\n\nI am confident these issues will be dealt with as the devs appear very commited to making your scary experience on the Goliath as pleasant as possible.\n\nGreat idea, great atmosphere but it needs a final fit and finish before she can drift the stars.

So really quickly, I wanna get the pro's and con's out of the way before I write a long paragraph.\n\nPros:\nA good horror elemnt, aka The fear of the unknown.\nA wide range of weapons.\nIt is different each playthrough.\nA huge open world ship *Though the missions kinda make it hard to roam.*\nA good nostalgia factor of both Dead Space and System shock 2.\nVERY innovative, which is what helps with the horror.\nAll the features listen on the store page, are actually in the game, whether or not it's buggy, it's still listed.\n\nCons:\nPoor AI\nUnoptimised\nPoor voice acting *I know it's one guy but eh, Im greedy.*\nAverage story.\n\nSo heres where the paragraph comes in, lemme start with the pros once more. In this game, while still using Jumpscares*Not loud noises though, so BIG bonus.* it creates the sort of feel of the unknown, especially when you are first trying the game. And while you may get used to the enemy encounter, you never know what to expect with each playthrough. You may have to go though the game without a single important chracter, or some missions are different, or even random encounters with things OUTSIDE the ship. My point is, this guy knows what makes good horror, and thats the fear of the unknown.\n\nSo while all that is nice and dandy, there are some flaws that may concern the audience, and that may be its AI. While the gameplay itself is really slow, the ai is VERY basic. Pretty much the ai does nothing but go at you, and once you touch the hitbox, you take damage, and that is it. No pathing, or anything really smart. On the bright side though, you get a wide range of enemies to deal with, whether it be big or small, they still proove to be a challenge to kill, especially in groups.\n\nSo I think that pretty much sums up the game in general. I hope this review helps your thinking of the game.\n\n\n","July 19, 2014","true","9.9"," 85 of 143 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","85","143","0","8"

Yes the creatues have some issues but they will be fixed when the patches start rolling out.\n\nHighly recommended for people that love survival horror games with gun action. Also for those that like Rogue-like elements, this game always starts differently and came have some very major impacts on the game itself.\n\nVideo review will be forth coming as I have to sit down and script it, but it's an awesome INDIE game for what it's worth and I loved every second of playing it.\n\n-EDIT as of VERSION 1.2-\n\nThis game has only gotten smoother since the latest update went live. So many more startings and scenarios have been included and someone just blow my mind (no giving any away).

Watched a few hours worth of gameplay and so forth.\n\nSo I'm going to start with this. If you enjoy a Survival Horror game that can take up to ten hours to complete one of the many different stories (Note: The game starts you off differently each time, you might have a gun, you might not have a gun. Also gives you different objectives) and you have to maintain ammo usage and a lot of the time, run for your life.\n\nYou can ♥♥♥♥ off the AI protagonist that's telling you what to do.\nYou only have a specific amount of light and oxygen to maintain.\n\nAny how to the pros and the cons.\nPros:\n- Immersive Environment and Gameplay\n- Keeps you on edge\n- AI (although buggy) is unique to the point that even\nthe guy who coded it still can't judge the AI movement\n- Not overly graphical intense\n- Doesn't hold your hand\n- Different to the horror genre\n- Riddles\n- Exploration that actually can help you in the end, or even make you lose\n- You actually have to be careful\n- You need to remember the environment\n- You have to listen\n- You have to read\n- You have to be cautious\n- When you are dead, you're dead\n- Easy to learn controls\n- Enemies toy with you\n\nCons:\n- A few bugs here and there that don't affect gameplay much\n- Aiming the weapons is a little difficult\n- Doesn't have a proper pause menu (You can click pause on the keyboard to pause the game but not many people are that bright)\n- Can't currently modify key mapping\n- Doesn't support a wide range of resolutions\n- A lot of loading\n- A few sounds gets irritating (When you step on a box)\n\nWell thats all from me, try the game out.

Yes it has some issues here and there, But the game itself has a lot of gameplay/time that you can spend roaming the full sized ship. Most of the issues that many people have said have been fixed in updates of the game. Some of the reviews have been based around the official release. I myself do not think the price of the game is too high as you can put a lot of time into the game and still enjoy it whenever you play the game.\n\nPersonally I believe that this game beats a lot of other indie horror games on the market. The reasons for this is that some games will contain a couple of jump scares but not have the same atmosphere as Ghostship Aftermath. Although I haven't put a lot of hours into the game I still enjoy playing Ghostship.\n\nAlthough the game was made for the rift playing on the pc is just has fun. Although you don't have the same atmosphere as being on the rift the game is still able to make you on the edge of the seat when playing. Another possitive point is the sound. The sound makes the atmosphere of the game a lot more scarier.\n\nThe controls of the game work fine it also supports controllers. I find that using either one works fine and haven't really noticed anything wrong with the control scheme of the game.\n\nI would definitely recommend getting this game as you can play the game as many times as you want and the experience wil be different all the time.","August 26, 2014","true","4.5"," 46 of 78 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","46","78","2","2"

I have been playing this for a while now and what i have played has been an awesome experience.

This review is for what it is right now. Devs are patching up and refining the game and are taking notes at the complaints itself. The only reason I thumbed this game down was for those issues that are in the game currently, The reason I thumbed this game up now is because the dev is taking his work seriously, listening to the community and actually making these fixes to make his game better. Which is the best thing a game dev can do.\n\nSo after speaking/playing with the dev who is very active with the community and actually playing the game for a good amount of hours I got a better understanding where the devs are getting at in the game. This is a hardcore survival horror that isn't meant to be finished in a single night and also meant to be a really hard game  since the devs goal is to give you the an immersive survival gameplay on a ship with changing enemies, a story that changes up a bit with random events . The game is actually a finished product but has bugs and issues that seriously needs to be ironed out which causes players to not want to progress too far. I am still playing the game as we speak overlooking the bug to see what the game has to offer deeper in. The only reason I didn't progress so far is because of the issues. Going in deeper I see this game has alot to offer.\n\nThe game itself is a ported off the rift version and  and was released so that we will get a chance to play it without having to use the rift (devs explained this  to me). The Vr version will be included in what you bought but due to this reason some bugs and problems does exist in this version.\n\nSo the game starts off with you entering a ship that was used as an experiment on prisoners when an alien lifeform overtook the ship and infected everyone on board. Your job is to get things operational again and to find out information about the lifeform to counter against it because it will be humanity's greatest threat. Many things are randomized in this game and it is never the same, the events, the branch of the story and the way the enemy are spawned at you.\n\nThe gameplay is a first person survival/ horror shooter which starts you off with 59 minutes of battery life, a full tank of oxygen and you'll probabaly be armed with a weapon if you get a certain branch. As you progress you'll find guns and supplies via the clues left by blood and writing on the wall along with hints about enemies  attack. So it has to be found and it is in limited quantity. The laser for the guns recharges slowly and the other weapons is limited by clips so you'll have to be careful on use and also on reload also because you could potentially empty a clip full of bullets from your best gun which will cause you to rely in the laser guns. The guns themselves j\n\nThe controls are fixed and feels much better. You can also play this game with a joypad but you cannot change the keybinds in any way. There is also no save function except for checkpoints or where you leave off so be careful\n\nThe game main goal is immersion which is very important for these type of games and that is the star here, the enemies jumping out of places, the sound effects is unlike anything you ever heard, the creepy music at times and the environment itself along with the game's roguelike elements where things arent the same makes it immersive and scary because you don't know what will pop out during your second plays after restarting either from death most likely or finishing which will cause you to second guess and panic.\n\nWhile the strength lies in immersion, its weakness lies in the rest of the places. some of the  enemy's ai is fixed up a bit but can still get stuck in places, they are more effective now. The collision of you towards environments sometimes will cause you to jitter sometimes.\n\nThere are 8 guns in the game, each guns handle differently and each gun requires you to find, the guns starts off weaker than you think with the laser guns that are rechargable but takes some time to do so. They can be used to kill off weaker infected while the stronger guns found later will benefit you greatly against the stronger ones. You can shoot enemy in the head to kill them quicker and also the weak  guns has uses such as  using them to strategically light your way in dark areas so that you do not waste your batter power.\n\nThe graphics uses unreal engine, has some nice effects and shading at times but unfortunately does look a bit outdated and this is because it came from the rift version, it is supposed to look much better on the rift but looks decent on the non rift version.\n\nLong story short I think this game was rushed just a bit and had some issues and problems that it came with that really needs to be ironed out, as the dev says he is fixing right now and also creating a manual for the community to help them a bit.\n\nOverall I hope the game progress with updates as time goes on to polish it up, so far from just touching the game the game feels MUCH better than what is was previously. Hopefully when everything is done there will be a decent price sale that will gather more players into this great immersive game that is different everytime you play it.\n\n+ Immersion is amazing even without occulus rift you can feel it, scary sounds, music and darkness will scare the crap out of you.\n+ Limited supply of battery/oxygen will cause you to panic when things go wrong, thank god you can replenish oxygen but not light so be mindful and use your laser weapon to light your way strategically\n+ Lightning and fog is done great well placed in places that will add to the immersion\n+ The clues/writing lieing around to help you find what you need is well written to help give you hints\n+ The objective is explained very well and its your goal to find the way. The ship is massive and offers places to explore. it is your job to learn how it works and find your way.\n+Controls are much better after being fixed!\n\n+- Map is hard to understand and will take time to get use to\n+- Decent Ai\n\n- Voice acting is just ok, its corny but fits the game perfectly (lol shaun)\n- Needs ability to rebind your own key.\n- Some clipping issues at places.\n- Graphics looks good but are said to look even better on rift because of the way they are designed\n- We can't get a rift yet.\n\n* I really want the rift version to fully enjoy this game immersion, as for the version it is now hopefully the patches will fix up the problems players find unenjoyable at the moment.","July 19, 2014","true","8.4"," 85 of 152 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","85","152","0","22"

I mean blood bathed walls with like one or two human corpses present... That's sort of poop.\n\n2) The aliens seem like they just don't know what the Hell they're doing.

The aliens range from giant flea-like creatures which come farting at you from nowhere to smurf-like zombies that make you feel like you're trapped in some cheap Haji rip-off of the Goonies with cloned versions of the Sloth; made even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ through the cloning process and rapidly multiplying cellular generation.\n\nOh yes.

What can i say about a game that feels so broken that i literally cannot bring myself to venture any further into it.  I Really did try to give it a chance, but from what i encountered, any further attempt to play would just be torture on my part. Keep in mind i LOVE SCI HORROR, and I even have  tolerance for mediocre games. But this....this...just...feels...broken..\n\nThe Pros:\n\nAtmosphere: I like the fact that it shows your guy wearing the helmet in first person, its a nice touch, and the atmosphere is pretty ok.\n\nSound: The ambient sounds were pretty good\n\nThe Cons:\n\nGameplay/ Controls: It's  totally clunky and unfinished. You pretty much have to be looking up at a certain height if you want your guy to run properly. And the Looking around aspect is prolly the worst I've seen in any game. Not even a mouse smoothing option can save this disaster\n\nGraphics: This game looks dated beyond belief. I know graphics aren't everything, but combining this aspect with the god awful controls is mind numbingly painful.\nt\nThe Enemies: Even the enemies feel broken as they move at you in a tight corrodor. and this game is nothing but tight corrodors from what Ive played. They just spaz out in the glitchiest ways possible. It was painful to witness, and after i abrupty died it just flashed me to the title screen in a broken manner. It was almost impossible to describe. The enemies in this game make the AI in Alien Colonial Marines look like the smartest AI ever conceived in the history of mankind.\n\nOptions: If you want to change one single setting it makes you go through every option indviidually in a different screen each time which is incredibly annoying. I have never come across this in a game and holy hell is it stupid.\n\nControls: Did i mention this game has the worst controls ever? No really, it does, If there was a way for me to give you this game i gladly would just so you can know the true horror of the worst controls ever.\n\nVoice Acting: It's really bad\n\nIn Conclusion: Ghostship Aftermath seemed like it had the potential to contribute something good to the sci fi horror genre. Instead what i experienced was a broken mess of a game with the worst controls and enemy AI I have ever encountered. This game is bad, stay far far away from it.","February 17, 2015","false","0.5"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grumbel45/recommended/280890/","grumbel45","grumbel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grumbel45/","1558 products in account","My experience with the game so far:\n\nThe first hour was essentially just walking down a corridor really slowly, checking some rooms turning on a generator and other minor stuff. Even so it was pretty simple from a game mechanics point of view (i.e. no real puzzles to solve). I actually quite enjoyed this section. It feld authentic walking around that ship, following signs on the wall and getting a sense of the layout, there was no overly gamey stuff to distract you and the whole athmospere was really well done. There was some  jerkiness in the physics, but nothing to problematic in that first section of the game.\n\nAfter that inital section I got a gun and then I died literally within 10 seconds of encountering the very first tiny enemy creature. Since the game has perma-death that means I have to restart from scratch now, no respawn, reload or anything is available.\n\nLets just say I consider it a suboptimal game design decision to have such a slow paced game married with quick permadeath. I am not recommending the game to anybody until that permadeath is removed.\n\nEdit: Played a bit more, the permadeath can be "fixed" by manually copying the savegame, which can be found at:\n\n...\SteamApps\common\GSaftermath\Binaries\Win32\gsstorysave0.sav\n\nJust exiting the game and then resuming it before you get killed can also be used to re-roll what monsters appear.\n\nAs for the game itself, ammo is extremely rare and most enemies are far to fast to hit with any precision. Thus it's extremly easy and almost unavoidable to run out of ammo. There is no real means to sneak around enemies and enemies kill you extremy quickly. There are also numerous bugs, reloading your weapon will eat up all the ammo in you gun, even if full, and the weapon will get sometimes unequiped, which is hard to notice as you still see you character holding it, only a HUD tells you that it's not equpped.\n\nEssentially whenever the game just lets you explore the ship and enjoy the athmosphere at a slow pace, it's really good. But whenever the monsters pop up, which sadly happens a lot, it's just a broken unplayable mess.\n\nEdit2: Played now some more hours and actually reached the end after some 15 hours. The permdeath is as already mentioned really just completely unacceptable. The game is so full of glitches, bugs and just a general lack of polish so that you will die a lot. I can't imagine anybody having the patience to finish the game with permadeath. Even when the game would actually work and be polished, it's just far to long and far to slow to make permadeath an acceptable solution. This game needs a proper "Restart at Last Checkpoint", which would be trivial to implement and while it wouldn't turn this into a great game, it would at least turn it into a somewhat enjoyable game. Alt-Tab switching and copying savegames around is really not helping the atmosphere.\n\nAs for the ammo problem, that solved itself, as the game does respawn ammo every time you reenter a room, so all you have to do is find one of the tiny few location that has ammo and then enter and exit the section a few times to gear up. This feels a little cheap and goes completely against the games goal of feeling realistic and authentic, but at least it makes the game somewhat playable. Health packs respawn as well and the medical bay in general is full of goodies or at least it was on my playthrough.\n\nThe way the game handles enemy spawning is also pretty crappy, instead of having the aliens be permanent citizen of the spaceship, they respawn each time you enter a section. Furthermore they only spawn when you walk past specific trigger points, so even if you checked every corner, the game might still spawn an enemy right behind you without giving you any chance to detect it beforehand. In some spots the game will also spawn enemies out of thin air right in front of you.\n\nEnemies themselves are also still far to hard to kill. The slower ones are ok, but all the fast spider creatures require a ton of luck, as while they aren't to hard to kill from a distance, they are completely impossible to kill with any precision when they went close range. You just end up spinning around and shooting at the ground hoping to hit something and more often then not you will simply die instead. The game doesn't have any kind of melee attack to kick enemies away and they can circle you faster then you can turn.\n\nAs for mission/task design, it's a bit lacklustre. There are some moments in the game, such as the very beginning, when the tasks that you are giving have an impact on the environment and feel organic. You switch on a generator and that gives you gravity and light and in turn completely transforms not only the look of the location, but also how you navigate it. However those tasks are very sparse throughout the game and most other tasks just feel like rather mundane fetch quests with no visible changes to the environment at all. There are no doors to unlock, no keycards to find, no puzzles that you have to solve or anything like that. It's just lots of going places, pushing buttons, then coming back and pushing more buttons. There is a lot of back and forth through the same location and some of it just feels like unnecessary filler, especially when you just go to a location for the AI to tell you were you have to go next, even so that AI happens to be in radio contact with you all there time and could have told you directly on where to go next instead of having a meaningless side trip.\n\nAs for story, there isn't much. As far as I can tell this game doesn't really have much in terms of audio logs or similar stuff to flesh out the background. I found a single log from a doctor and there is supposed to be another one from the captain that I didn't find, but that's about it. The rest of the crew doesn't seem to have left anything behind to read or look at, outside of the random graffiti on the wall, which however are all rather uninformative. All the little task you do over the course of the game, do however result in something in the end, so it's not like there isn't any payoff at all, but a little bit more backstory would have been nice.\n\nThe loading times are another problem, even so the game does have airlocks all over it that should make loading seamless, they game still kicks you to a loading screen when the airlock closes, so instead of being able to check your weapons and objectives, you have to stare at a boring loading screen. This hampers the flow of the game quite a bit, as while the loading times aren't very long, they are extremely frequent.\n\nOverall this game isn't terrible, there are a lots of things to like. The atmosphere is great and being able to free roam a space ship is something you don't find in many (any?) other games. The whole exploration can feel a lot like Resident Evil 1 in parts, as you have a lot of freedom and really are left to your own navigation skills without any big arrows pointing the way, although the AI will give you objectives all the time. But the collision detection/physics are incredible buggy and some of the enemies terribly unbalanced, so you need a lot of tolerance for jank to distil some enjoyment out of this game. On top of that you have to deal with the whole permadeath issue, but at least you can work around that.\n\nIt looks like this game will receive some further patches and updates, so this is something to keep an eye on, but for the time being it has still a few to many issue to truly recommend it. If you really like the idea of open world space ship exploration, go for it, there are moments in this game were everything clicks together and it feels great, just don't expect those moments to last, as some bug or glitch will surely get in the way.\n\nPS: It's also worth to mention that I so only did a single playthrough, the games story is however randomized, I don't know yet to what degree that will impact things and if some playthroughs are much better or worse then others.","July 25, 2014","true","19.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrPingy/recommended/280890/","MrPingy","Mr. Pingy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrPingy/","130 products in account","This game is not an FPS, it is a sci-fi survival horror game.  Survival here means you have resources you need to manage other than health and ammo.  You start out with only 90 minutes of oxygen so you need to keep track of how much you have and try to find a place to recharge before you run out, and sprinting uses 4x the oxygen so you have to be aware of your situation and decide whether it's more important to move fast or breathe longer.\n\nLight is a limited resource that needs managed for survival, but also plays into the horror side of things.  Dark is scary and scary is good, but you can't see items, messages, or enemies in the dark so you need a flashlight to survive.  If you're using a flashlight it's not so dark and not so scary which is bad for horror.  So for middle ground between a scary dark ship and being able to see things and survive you only get 60 minutes of flashlight battery (non-rechargeable).  If you run out completely... good luck with that.\n\nAll gamers know with melee enemies and guns that backup+shoot=win.  To disrupt this equation there are boxes all over the ship that are collision enabled.  Here if you try and run backwards shooting you risk running into a box and getting caught by the bad guy if you don't jump over it fast enough.  This is an intentional feature designed to make you watch where you're going and prevent you from playing this like an FPS.  Remember where I said "this is not an FPS" earlier?\n\nAdditionally, enemies are very difficult to kill, especially in groups.  It imbues a sense helplessness in the player, and being helpless is scary.  In one variation of the storyline I ended up in a corridor filled with aliens yelling "F*CK YOU DIE DIE DIE! F*CK YOU DIE DIE DIE!" as I poured plasma rifle fire into the oncoming swarm and screamed "NOOOOOOOOO!" as I was overwhelmed and eaten.\n\nPerma-death is listed in the features section and seems self explanatory, but I feel it needs reiterated because some people don't quite get how it works.  The game does save at loading screens so that you can quit and pick up the story later if you need to, but there is no manual saving or loading.  When you die though your last save point dies with you and you have to start a new game.  Having a save point to fall back on makes dying less of an imposition and alleviates the player's fear of dying and doesn't emphasize survival.\n\nThe game does lack some polish and is rough in some areas, but if you consider it was made by 1 developer with 0 budget, it is understandable.  He has been continually improving the game over time, releasing updates periodically.  He has also already released 1 free DLC and will be releasing another for Halloween as a token of appreciation to the customers and as an apology for the buggy release.  He's not perfect, but how many developers even bother to try and make things right with their customers?\n\nEven if it is rough in places, the tension in the game is palpable.  I usually play games to relax, and I've got to say that I almost don't like playing this one because it keeps me wound up the whole time.  The biggest part is you don't know what's going to happen next.  The storyline is randomized, enemy spawns are randomized, the only thing you can be sure of from one game to the next is your own name, the location of some weapons/objects, and that you're on a big scary Ghostship.\n\nEven the way you move is tense, difficult, and adds to the atmosphere.  You clunk along slowly in your heavy spacesuit with magnetic boots, and although you can "sprint" (I use that word loosely, its more like a fast jog) it is only for a couple seconds before you have to go back to walking speed.  After all, you are Dr. Jake Abbots from the Colonial Science Division, not a space Marine.\n\nI recommend this game because it achieves its overriding goal, to scare you the entire time, and the randomized storyline is a novel idea that provides tons of hours of re-playability.  I've also posted a few technical considerations in the forums I didn't have room for here.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/280890/discussions/0/613936673351290353/\n\nP.S. I HIGHLY recommend reading the MANUAL[cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com] and watching the getting started video from the developer before playing the first time as you're thrown into the deep end on this game.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H4gNxImVng","September 16, 2014","true","27.6"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","20","40","0","0"

Now the rest of the story is a bit hard to explain, that's because no two adventures are the same. You see the developer decided to allow for infinite playability in this free roaming sc-fi horror game.\n\nThe graphics in this game look pretty solid, and you can definitely tell that this game was developed first for a VR device, and then pulled back to allow others to enjoy the game. It does utilize the Unreal engine, though I have some serious questions about the hardware that this game was being developed on. There are several different areas and levels of the ship, most requiring you to move between pressure holds, aka the loading screen. The odd thing is the constant appearance of these pressure holds. I was not aware that the Unreal engine was killing my processor so much that it required very small bite sized chunks of a world to be accessible between loading screens. The enemies that you will face, of course are of the alien variety, and you will be utilizing very generic looking weapons.\n\nThe sounds of the game have a very deep space spooky vibe, and you will notice that things that are supposed to be voiced, are indeed voice, if not VERY LONG WINDED. There is the ability to cause two audio dialogue tracks to play one after another, which of course destroys whatever information that you were listening to and have just triggered.\n\nThe controls are the usual WASD for movement, SPACE to jump, use the mouse for camera movements, to aim and to fire.\n\nAlright so here's the deal, as I stated before this is a very ambitious project, and I like the fact that the developer wanted people to have a unique experience every time they played, the only problem is that I have yet to have that experience where I am DYING to continue deep into the game. Well let me correct that, I've died way too many times, with very limited ammo, yes survival game, but once I'm out of ammo, the only thing I can do is run to the pressure holds, which what am I going to do then? Oh there's one fun little fact about the pressure holds. It is a one way in, one way out type of system. So lets say you accidentally go into the wrong pressure hold, you were supposed to go to floor 5 but accidentally went in on floor 4. Well what you will have to do is actually exit the pressure hold, and then re-enter it, you can't just turn around and take the door that just a second ago, before a brief load screen was active.\n\nAs far as I can tell there is no melee combat in the game, you HAVE to use a gun, and if you don't have one, well I'm not sure what you are going to do, but the game will hold your hand to get your first gun of the game.\n\nThere are so many variables in this game that its a bit too much. To be honest I think that the developer probably should have made one hell of a solid storyline, making sure all the pieces of the game work to perfection, and then started to add little random stuff into the game. As it is now, its very cookie cutter, and there's not a whole lot that keeps one's attention, besides the frustrating pressure locks. Oh and if you die in the game, that becomes where you saved your game and so you can NEVER start back at a checkpoint. That reminds me of something else, while we are on the topic, the in game menu, is completely useless, and has a delay on it after you make a selection. Let's say that you accidentally call it up and then you just want to click on Resume game, well that menu is going to stick around for a bit, and of course the cursor is still going to be showing, so you will think that its broken, and I have successfully locked up the game by clicking rapid fire between the only two options on the menu, resume or exit game. With a game this complex there really needed to be a control layout, and perhaps a log/journal to help the player in the game. I still have no idea how to do many of the actions. Yes I have looked at the information from the start screen, but its a completely different ball game when you are in game, and all of a sudden you need to use a key/button that you haven't used yet, and now you have no way of figuring it out short of hitting every key/button.\n\nUnfortunately I think the scale of this project was a little too big, and so this game doesn't really do it for me in the end. I was really hoping for maybe a Dead Space lite type of game, but this game has some enhancements and fundamental improvements before it gets there. This game gets a 4.3 out of 10.","October 9, 2014","false","2.2"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

The Colonial Defence Force (CDF), who is in charge of protecting earth and its colonies has sent the spaceship “CDF Goliath” to investigate. Strangely enough, CDF lost contact with the “Goliath” as soon as it reached the Icarus system. It is now up to you to find out what happened to the “Goliath”. CDF needs answers and sent a team of two to look into it. Well, it is your lucky day! You are the one who will step on the “CDF Goliath”.\n\nGhostship Aftermath is an adventure/horror/survival/action game where you play Dr. Jake Abbotts, who is going to enter the spaceship “Goliath” and hopefully find out what happened to it. While your colleague, the fearless Dr. David Riggs, will stay put and secure on the CSD Alexis as mission control.\n\nThis game will provide you with a slightly different scenario at the start of each game. For example, the courageous Dr. Riggs might keep the working gun within his reach and be more than happy to send you to the abattoir without anything to defend yourself, or he might be happy to actually give you a gun and tell you to pick up further ammunition nearby. Thank god the Goliath is a military vessel. As events change the course of the story, this game will give you great re-playability.  Plenty of weapons to find on the Goliath; some will be effective at close range, but you will aim to get the ones effective in long range, especially against these giant cockroach thingies. They are fast, come in groups, and are very difficult to kill. On top of that, you will have several types of zombie coming at you - a rather dangerous encounter, I must say!\n\nI really enjoy the comments and hints on the wall; they will help you find weapons and get to your next objective in one piece. One more thing about finding weapons - some are easy to spot and others are lying around on the floor, but not obviously. Medic boxes, ammunition and amour will be lying around the vessel. Make sure to remember where the medic boxes are so you can go back there to heal yourself.\n\nThe graphics are good but the animation could have been better in my opinion. One thing I found a bit annoying at the start was the rather frequent loading between ship decks. Controls are fine and easy to use. One aspect the game portrays very well is the chilling and scary atmosphere - it is absolutely brilliant.\n\nPositive:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Events change the course of the story\n-	Good graphics\n-	Scary atmosphere extremely well portrayed\n-	Challenging\n-	Achievements & Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Animation could have been better\n-	Voice over could have been better\n\nGhostship Aftermath is an interesting FPS/survival/horror game that creates an exquisite scary and chilling atmosphere!\n\n7.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

My opinion is was still a great first attempt for someone without any assistance.\n\nThe old cliche "Fail to prepare,prepare to fail"sounds great but in this game  the preparation can often only be done in 'instant action mode' first which always leaves you with a save game to fall back on.Ignoring this advice and starting in normal often leaves you dead,and looking to blame the dev for everything thats wrong with the world,let alone the game?Still it will help when I come to play CDF I suppose?I liked the depth of the stories and the sheer volume of content alone for one man.A lot of what I disliked would  surely have been sorted, given the time and money,as it was all in the lack of polish folder.Being two years ago now  money was obviously an issue cos it had a lot of good ideas going for it.","February 7","true","32.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WonderGamer/recommended/280890/","WonderGamer","WonderGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WonderGamer/","1744 products in account","The Good\n- This game has a lot of potential based on the path the developer decided to take, however that's really where the positives end...\n- The game does have a number of "scare tactics" in it, such as suspenseful sound effects, random events that can catch you off guard, "flashlight in the dark" effects, enemy noises where you may not know where they're coming from or an enemy rushing you before you expect it, silent enemies coming out of nowhere for a quick attack, silhouettes of enemies in the distance where you're not entirely sure what is headed your way, among other things; but all this doesn't matter much when the game isn't really playable (see The Ugly section)\n\nThe Bad\n- No options whatsoever to change your controls.  You either need to learn the controls from the diagram before you get into a game (as you can't bring that display up once in a game) or fumble with the controls until you learn them.  I might suggest taking a screenshot of that screen & loading it on a secondary monitor or printing it out to help remind you what they are while in game.\n- While the game does at least provide inverted vertical alignment (meaning Y-axis on your mouse), it does not allow you to invert the rotation of weapons with your mouse wheel.  I'm used to getting more powerful weapons by scrolling down on the mouse wheel, unfortunately the game is set to do this the other way around & there's no way to change it...\n- Aiming down the sight of weapons has a rather odd orientation to it, giving you a crosshair at the point of impact rather than changing the viewpoint of your gun or placing the crosshair in the middle of your screen where it should be.  Also it's sometimes hard to gauge when that floating crosshair is getting placed on an invisible wall rather than an enemy you may be trying to hit.\n- The game seems a bit slow to me, but perhaps that was done on purpose...\n- Vertical alignment seems odd; for the most part you are locked to a level perspective on the same level you are on, but move the mouse far enough up or down to get out of that choke-zone & you're will look up or down as if looking at another level.  The vertical alignment is by no means standard however & is going to feel odd for people that are used to proper FPS games...\n\nThe Ugly\n- You will often times run into enemies before you even find a weapon & with no way to attack even with melee attacks, often times this results in your death as soon as you start.  With often times a lengthy opening scene, you'll find that your runs can often times be a HUGE waste of time...\n- You will find yourself running into environmental obstacles every once in a while, sometimes you may end up finding yourself getting stuck either on the environment or behind something after a random event, leaving your only option to restart the game...\n- Once in a while you'll get bugged enemies that can either get stuck in the walls or in an attack animation & often times they will be unkillable.  This would not be such a huge issue if not for the fact that sometimes they get stuck right in the path of where you need to go & the result is once again you have to restart the game.\n\nEDIT:\nAfter the developer decided to respond to this negative review which was targeting mainly the Story mode (with a downvote of the review, no surprise there), he suggested that I give the Instant Action mode a try.  I did & there are a few things to add in regards to this mode:\n\nThe Good (Instant Action)\n- With the addition of this mode, you do at least have a playable version of the game without game breaking bugs (at least none I saw when I attempted to test it, with perhaps an exception to getting stuck on the environment; I've learned to avoid such locations however, so this isn't something I've attempted to retest just yet).\n- You start with an arsenal of weapons in this mode, so you won't be running into enemies before you even have a means to defend yourself.\n- This next point could be considered good or bad, depending on your viewpoint:  This mode completely bypasses the opening, storyline & commentary throughout the game.  Some people may enjoy this, however others may not want to waste time going through it.  In my personal opinion, I only had a problem with it when I had to go through it, then the game got bugged in Story mode only leaving me to have to restart the game.  I don't entirely mind the Story elements of the game, but it turns out to be a huge waste of time when you can't actually get through the game due to various bugs in Story mode, so the lack of these features in exchange for a playable version of the game was an acceptable trade-off for me.\n\nThe Bad (IA)\n- You may start with weapons in this mode, but keep in mind you are also going to see enemies much earlier than you would in Story mode.  Expect an increased difficulty in IA mode with multiple enemies coming at you at the same time where you may have had them limited at early points in the Story mode.  The first time I started this mode, I literally got killed within 5 seconds of starting...  People who like a challenge may enjoy the increased difficulty, but it's really up to them how much of a difficulty increase they are willing to tolerate at an early point in the game...\n\nFinal synopsis:\nThe game may have potential, but at this time I can't really say it's worth spending money on until some of the major bugs are fixed.  Every time I attempted to play the Story mode, I would always have to restart the game, to the point that I didn't even feel like playing the rest of the time while trying to gain cards for the game because you couldn't really get anywhere in the game with having to constantly restart it...\n\nUpdate:\nAfter the developer contacted me on this review, I retested the game in IA mode & found that at least this mode was playable, although with it's own little quirks...  I still can't say I recommend the game because the Story mode is in such poor shape (as well as various bugs in IA mode, but none that I could see were game-breaking), but at least there is a playable mode in the game that isn't going to make you feel like you're entirely wasting your time or your money if you've already purchased it.","December 25, 2014","false","3.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

The one thing I was immediately told through the video I watched was the game had it's issues and bugs, but if you were a fan of this type of game it was something you could overlook and the game was still completely playable, albiet buggy. So I bought it, played some, enjoyed what I saw, and then put the game down for a bit. What reintroduced me to thinking this game would go somewhere, was the fact the game was recieving constant updates, patches, and content releases; it seemed at least once a week booting up Steam there was something to download for the game. Which is honestly a good sign when compared to several other indie games or standalone games (wink, wink) that never see a single patch or content update, or see once in a blue moon. It does honestly feel like the developer is trying to improve the game, and make it the best it can be.\n\nFrom what I've experienced from the game, it does have some good atmosphere. You honestly feel like you're in a spacesuit, sent over to investigate a ghost ship. You're locked inside a suit with limited oxygen, limited battery life for your flashlight, and you don't know much more about anything other than go check out that ship; it's also a rogue-like with permadeath, which just reinforces the fear that these game elements add. The story advances through your gameplay, which makes it quiet fun. Wth the random level generator, sometimes you get that original Alien feel of helplessness as you walk through corridors completely helpless with no weapons hoping to find some kind of weapon and not to run into anything that wants to kill you; whereas other times you start with a weapon, and tensions are a little more relax as you're at least able to halfway defend yourself. The game also has support for Oculus Rift, which I do not have, but I can say it's a plus to be able to have that option, as well as saying the game itself would probably take on a whole new level of atmospheric tension and scares with the Oculus.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of Sci-Fi, if you like games based in or around space or space travel, or like horror games, I don't see any reason why you wouldn't enjoy this one. It deffinitely has its problems, but seeing as the game doesn't have a 20-man team behind it and was thrown together by (as far as I know) a single person, it's good for what it is. I'm also probably trying to look a little too hard at anything good in it as a biased fan of Sci-Fi.","November 2, 2014","true","1.0"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","3"

As of now, game is buggy, glitchy, unfriendly,, walking and running are clumsy, controls are messy and overall, it doesn't motivate to play longer.\nBut this game has a HUGE POTENTIAL. It really reminds of older "Alien" movies (but no team to watch your back). Huge, abandoned ship, light problems, blood and broken alien (or they look like) eggs, not much ammo, semi-radnom stories... It appears this game has less focus on action and more on survival and horror (and this is actually good aspect).\n\nBut, in my honest opinion, this game needs time and support. And lots of improvements. Maybe in a few months (maybe even years), this game could make a blast.

Limited settings options (e.g. no subtitles, brightness, or level of detail), no tutorial (and no way to view the controls in-game, that I could find), and ridiculously slow movement (seriously, it makes Dear Esther feel like greased lightning). So far the developers have remained active with updates, so maybe someday this will be more than just potential, but for a non-early access game potential just isn't good enough.\nEdit: To the defensive dev - the movement speed being intentionally slow doesn't make it any less boring. And don't tell me that I can just use sprint when the game description basically says that sprinting too much will lead to an early death "Your actions will decide your fate in this non-linear sci-fi survival horror game with real consequences. You have limited oxygen and sprinting uses it 4x as fast, while your helmet has a non-rechargeable, non-replaceable 1 hour flashlight battery. So manage them well to avoid suffocation, or dying to unseen horrors lurking in the dark." If you think that's the right choice for the game, then great! Leave it that way!

Like in most roguelikes when you die you have to start over. It's a great concept, but the execution is very flawed. The main problem is the frustrating combat. It tries to simulate you being in a big spacesuit. Making aiming feel weird and the guns are very weak. Making enemies die very slow. And they almost always spawn in groups and can be very fast. Since you are in a big spacesuit you can't outrun them. So you have to stand your ground and fight. So you will lose lots of these battles and have to start over again. Making it even more frustrating. It's like they couldn't make a choice during the development to make it more of a horror fps(like Doom 3) or a survival horror(like Amnesia). And ended up with a very weird balance. It's too bad because the game has a huge potential.\n\nAlso the settings menu is very annoying. The items are not listed under each other and seperatly changable. But you have to select that you want to change your settings and you will get one setting at a time until you got through all settings. So if you want to change one setting you have to go through all settings again. It's very user unfriendly. And for some reason a inverted aiming is standard and you need to select that you want inverted aiming to get a normal aiming.","December 18, 2014","false","3.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

Also a few of these people were  programmers themselves and I wondered how they would feel, having their early work ripped to shreds, with no intention of doing a proper review but within a well scripted you tube environment.Myself I am old enough to make my own choices so my initial thumbs down must change to a massive thumbs up.I will be only too happy to buy the devs next release(If that's ok with my wife that is?) because I know he's learning well from the experience.","October 4, 2014","true","135.0"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","10","24","0","2"
