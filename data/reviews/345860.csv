I think the main problem i find with the game is that it is "lifeless" more or less.\n\nLets have a checklist to follow:\n\n- Very poor level design.\n\nThis is one of the biggest flaws in the game,. Stages in shmup's need to have a sense of flow about them. Waves, attack formations, enemy tactics, etc. SGS way of doing things is simply to stack as many things as it can that can shoot and spawn in from the top of the screen. The enemies that come towards you feel completely random despite being preset and there is little that breaks this monoity in all of the stages and it creates a frustrating event where 8 to 12 large enemies come at you with little connectivity to each other, some even stacking on top of each other.\n\nIt also doesn't help that each stage is set in space. Space is as entertaining in shmup's as what's placed around it and what is placed is either dull single planets or lots of rocks. There is a nice transistion of the background on stage 5 but it's very fleeting.\n\n- Bland boss design\n\nThis is a MAJOR flaw in any game of this genre. All of the bosses in the game are dull, boring boxes that do little to stop you. Most of the bosses have stupid amounts of health and take ages to grind down to dust. They rarely change their attack tactics in response to damage and most of the attack pattens are stupidly easy to dodge out of the way (the 2nd boss is laughable in this respect, as it has no response to the destruction of it's side guns.)\n\n- Spite design is lifeless.\n\nOther than the player ship and one of the enemy ships, no other spite in the game has any real animations. They just fly at you and shoot. They are shaded colours and some of them are shaped nicely (The 5th stage boss has a nice look to it), but are as lifeless as a cardboard box. Bosses catch fire when low on health (random fire spites drawn over the body) and a few animated lasers but other than that the artwork is as flat as a ironing board.\n\n- Power up system is stupid\n\nThe power up system is wild, untamed and at the same time restrictive and in-organic. In each stage you can collect 1 of each of the power-ups (bullet power-up, sub-weapon power-up dependent on the ship you play as and rate of fire power-up), because of this you can't organicly collect more power ups than the stage number allows (You can collect more if you lost some, but you can't pass the limit set by the stage number). In addition, when you get hit there is a random chance that you will drop a power-up. You can recollect it after a delay but all of these power-ups fly upwards, but because every enemy ship in the game is constantly spawning (outside of bosses) you WILL get hit again by another enemy if you attempt to collect it. Btw.. it is possible to get hit multible times in quick sucession, with the possiability of dropping more than 1 power up.\n\nThe biggest problem with this is when fighting bosses. Some bosses are very large and will cover the screen.. and if you get hit that power-up will fly up into the boss's body. During boss battles, there is no way to gain new power-ups so if you lose any of your power-ups you started the boss with you then it will take a even longer grind to kill the boss.\n\n- Poor ship balance\n\nYea.. this is often a reason why in many shmup's they keep the playable number of ships to a low number. Some of the ships in this game are pretty useless. The one with the flamethrower for example has terrible usability outside of machoists. Some of the other ships will rip stages and bosses apart like there is no tomorrow. The mutli-sweaping laser ship is pretty much a I-win button in stages 90% of the time while the ship "gold" is pretty much overpowered to the extreme compared to the other ships.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIn all due repect, there are some things i like about the game. The life system is a nice conversion over the traditional lives system in most shmups, including the ability to slowly regain life by grazing enemy shots. The soundtrack was above average in most regards and hardcore mode brings true terror to the the audience that desires a good challenge.\n\n\n\nIn final, there is little i can recommend to a vet of the genre here that you can't find elsewhere on steam at roughly the same price (Reflex, Kamui, Crimson Clover). I do respect the devs making the game for chaity, it's just that the majority of the design is something from a run of the mill game from MS-DOS days.. and not the good ones sadly.","January 24, 2015","false","8.3"," 58 of 89 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","58","89","0","4"

And then there's Suepr Galaxy Squadron. This game is one of the best, if not THE best shmup I've played on PC. Challenging gameplay, a wide selection of ships to choose from, retro-style graphics and soundtrack make this a shmup that every shmup/bullet-hell fan shoudl get.

It won't win any awards for its concept, but it does offer a surprising number of unique ships that play somewhat differently from each other. The result is a rather replayable shooter, if only to test the functions of each ship, which I found enjoyable.\n\nGameplay is a standard shmup. Shoot anything that moves, avoid bullets, grab items. The items dropped by enemies are mostly random; it is thus possible to have a bunch of missiles before you ever get a laser upgrade. The game lacks a "focus" mode, where you can slow down your ship to maneuver tight spaces. Thus I found faster ships, which often have less armor, work against me.\n\nThere are 14 ships to choose from in this game. Surprisingly most ships have a good balance about them, though a few stood out as being much better or much worse than the others. The majority of my time spent on this game was comparing each and every ship by fully upgrading them, and finding out which ones I liked best. Every ship possesses a unique "limit break" of sorts. As you grab points, your bar fills up and you can unleash a powerful attack or defensive ability that is based on your current ship. These occur often enough that your ship's special power is worth taking into consideration, especially on endless mode.\n\nThere's a rudimentary plot about a cold war between humans and aliens, and every ship has a bit of backstory, which is cool. Beyond that, the game largely throws story out the window, much like the entire genre does, which is a shame because it seemed like a promising story.\n\nUnlike most bullet hells, SGS has a health system that allows you to withstand more than one hit. On top of that, enemies occasionally drop health items to replenish your life. You can even heal yourself by getting grazed by enemy bullets. Also surprising, the invulnerability period after getting hit is relatively generous. It's a refreshing system that provides some amount of tanking ability, and is thus friendlier to new players to the genre. When you get hit, your ship will drop one of its power-ups, but it's easily reacquired by simply flying over it and grabbing it again. Hardcore mode exists for those who prefer the one-hit death style of gameplay. There seems to be no additional reward for playing on hardcore.\n\nMost of the game is easy enough. There's six stages in total, each one lasting maybe 3-5 minutes. If you die, the game generously lets you continue on the last stage you were on. The bosses are great, being hulking machines (mostly) with collapsible parts, wide bullet patterns and just as large health pools. The last boss is such a large leap in difficulty that I'm not sure I could ever beat it with certain ship designs. It's a long enough battle that it might as well be considered a stage in of itself.\n\nGraphics are good. It's entirely pixel-art, and well-animated, particularly explosions. I like that every upgrade you acquire is a noticeable improvement, typically giving you additional shots, and sometimes even a graphical change. I have not experienced any slowdown despite the large number of moving things, even on endless, so that gets good marks. Music is chip-tunish, and somewhat upbeat but also kind of on the forgettable side.\n\nI recommend playing the game with a gamepad, though keyboard actually works well enough. The game did not recognize my USB gamepad; if the same occurs to you I recommend Joy2Key which often solves this problem on similar games.\n\nWhile I wouldn't recommend it at full price, it's not bad at a discount. All proceeds go to the Child's Play charity, so even if you don't enjoy the game, someone else may benefit. For the game to be created by largely one person, this is a pretty commenable effort. I give Super Galaxy Squadron a 7/10. It's super short, but because of that, you can replay it in short bursts with many different ships, so it works out in the end. SGS satisfies that urge to just jump into a game and start shooting stuff without rhyme or reason.","November 28, 2015","true","9.3"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

The game has been turned up to 11, as the game is not only pretty to look at, but it has ramped up the enemies and challenge in several ways. The developer obviously took feedback from the original game, as UI changes makes things a lot easier to see, and it complements the strong action gameplay that has the controls necessary to get through the tight spaces in between bullet barrages. There's a lot of ship variety as well, although the number of bullet patterns do leave a bit to be desired. And the game, while it was in Early Access, seems to still have a mode that's “coming soon”, which offput me a tiny bit. But never the less, A great shmup for the price of admission here, and can not only help satisfy the SHMUP veteran, but is a good introductory game for those who want to try the genre out for the first time. All in All, a worthy purchase.\n\n\nLists:\n+:\nGood basic SHMUP action. Throws everything and the kitchen sink at you, and when things get nuts, things get nuts.\nControls are where they need to be. Gives you the precision to get through the onslaught of bullets that you need, without being overly sensitive.\nGreat presentation and aesthetic. The story presentation does the scifi theme well, but the color choices for bullets/ships was smartly put together. It's easy to see everything on the field, and it's clear that the developers understood how to complement game design with aesthetic.\nGood accessibility for new players of the genre, but gives the challenge for SHMUP veterans as well.\nA good variety of ships. A lot of different strategies are viable because of the variety here, from close up in your face “melee” type damage to turtling damage and focusing on hitting powerful enemies. Some may feel similar in the end, but there is a level of detail that does separate the similar ships from each other.\nLike the weapon powerups system and how getting hit makes you drop a couple of them. Forces quick decision making as being bombarded with bullets could lead you to abandoning the power ups because of the additional damage and power ups that you'd lose.\nA good example of a remastering: changing some slight mechanics in game play, upping the graphics\nDecent soundtrack. Complements the scifi and gameplay rather well.\n-:\nLacking some basic options. A music slider? That seems like a standard  now a days, and no bindable keys as well. Disappointing.\nCould actually use a bit more variety in the bullet patterns area. Within the first few levels, it's thrown pretty much all the different patterns at you, it just throws MORE at you.\nDespite coming out of early access, there's still a mode that seems to be unfinished. This is a personal gripe: if you're part of early access, I expect a completed product if you're going to come out of it.","February 22","true","3.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/345860/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","I thought that Super Galaxy Squadron was a pretty decent little 2D shooter, but this edition is flat-out superb.\n\nFirst off, apologies to the individuals responsible for this game's storyline. Everytime I played, I skipped all of the cut-scenes. All I know is that the bad guys have to be destroyed, and there's something involving a core. I'll be real here, I tend to prefer STG storylines that are badly-translated, don't make a lot of sense, or are just flat-out insane. Anyway, there are six stages and several ships to choose from, have at it.\n\nThe level of difficulty can "best" be described as bullethell...but not really. There are more tiny orbs of deadly danger than average, but rarely will you ever navigate a sea of bullets. Why? Because if the situation comes to that, then you did something very wrong, and you'll probably die soon. Enemy ships tend to stay on-screen a long time. This gives them more than a couple opportunities to unleash their payload. While it certainly benefits your livelihood to destroy enemies as quickly as possible, you might want to hold off occasionally...\n\nThe scoring system is based around a multiplier guage. Almost every type of ship is worth a +.1, and these add up very quickly. Sometimes you'll want to keep enemies alive for an extra half-second or so to help manage your guage. Upon hitting the maximum of x10(!), then you'll want to use your hyper weapon. This will trigger overdrive aka FEVER mode, and all pick-ups are worth ten times their value.\n\nWhen it comes to making a good STG, dodging and shooting are the most important aspects. This is where the game really shines. Everything has a natural feel to it. When you're avoiding bullets, you acquire this 6th sense, and sink into a sense of sublimity. To put it another way, I like this game because I don't notice anything that stands out. To me, 2D shooters should be business as usual. Things that stand out tend to be bad, like erratically-moving bullets, weird/poor hit-boxes, and so on. There's none of that nonsense in this game.\n\nThe overdrive/fever system is really neat, but unfortunately it doesn't come into play very often. I suppose this should be blamed on my lack of skill, but I can only catch the FEVER maybe once or twice a play-through. At around the 7x to 9x mark, the multiplier guage can drop at an extremely fast rate, and I just can't seem to destroy enemies quickly enough. While this is going on, some potential moments for huge points are missed out on. For example, there are nearly-invisible rings at certain points in the game. If you fly your ship inside them and fire away, you'll discover a medal worth 500,000 points. Imagine grabbing that shiny behemoth while under the effects of a FEVER.\n\nBut let's consider the possibility that I'm wrong, and it's not actually my fault. The reason I and possibly others can't maximize our scoring potential is because the playable ships are a little too weak. I'm not asking for a huge buff, just 15-20% more damage for most ships, and possibly larger boosts for certain ships. I noticed that one of them uses a lot of close-range weaponry. For piloting such a high-risk piece of junk, I expect to do a ton of damage.\n\nAs good as Super Galaxy Squadron EX is, it still requires some refinements. The top-scores on the leaderboards can be attributed to the game sometimes not resetting the score when starting a new game. My 60+ million score at or near the top is the result of two play-throughs. The final boss is far more difficult than anything else in the game, and requires a lot of needle-threading. Some ships are just too fast to safely weave between everything, and other ships are too weak to destroy the boss in a reasonable amount of time. Then there are the minor issues like rumble and screen-shaking re-enabling itself everytime I start a new game.\n\nI figure that this game is still being worked on, but even in its current state, I highly recommend it. This is one extremely solid STG.","March 15","true","7.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

If you're not convinced by that statement alone, keep reading.\n\nYou start off, and it's like, "oh ♥♥♥♥, some aliens are ♥♥♥♥ing up our planet!  What's going to happen to Earth?!"  I'll tell you what's going to happen, 14 of the best god damned pilots are going to ♥♥♥♥ their ♥♥♥♥ up, and you're one of them!  Choose your ship, pop the cockpit, strap in, and get ready for mayhem, it's Super Galaxy Squadron!\n\n"Where do I begin?"  You might be wondering.  Check those options, son.  You can toggle the rumble of the gamepad (if applicable), the shake of the screen whenever there's an explosion (which are awesomely frequent) and adjust the volume.  Check the controls if you need to, regardless you're reminded of them at the start of each mission incase the slaughter of thousands of angry aliens from Tau Ceti has melted your mind.  Scoreboards?  Yeah, check them in the options or on Steam.\n\nOutside of the options, there's a button aptly labeled, "start."  Hit that and choose your mode.  Normal mode provides you with a health bar, and when that ♥♥♥♥ hits zero, you've added one last explosion into the mix, and start the level over.  Continues?  Plenty of them!  Want to stop playing and pick it back up later?  You sure as hell can!  Collect your power-ups for your main spread, secondary weapon, and a boost to your rate of fire.  Check the status of each by pausing, it'll tell you.  So you've noticed the, "Hyper," bar in the lower left?  Good.  That's your special weapon, and each ship has a different one.  Think Normal is too easy?  Shift into Hardcore and get blasted in the face!  One hit, you're done, son, back to the beginning of the level.  This time, you can't continue forever, so make it count!\n\n"Endless mode?  What's that?"  It's exactly what you think it is, an endless wave of those ET ♥♥♥♥ers coming for you, and only you, since their buddies were ripped apart on your last excursion in the twilight.  The lower right of the screen has a number, that's what wave you're on, and it caps out at 30 when ♥♥♥♥ gets downright bananas.  Survive as long as you can, rack up that score, and brag about it after seeing your name on the global leaderboards, if you're good enough that is.  Oh yeah, there's a hardcore mode for this ♥♥♥♥, too.\n\n"Can there be any more to this already amazing game?!"  Yes.  That music you hear?  That's done by the fantastic band, Random Encounter.  Check those guys out.\n\nAre you prepared to battle the Ceti forces?  Do you want to rock out to some killer tracks while doing so?  Do you love shmups and explosions?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/breakfastcompanion/recommended/345860/","breakfastcompanion","Deluxe Breakfast Companion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/breakfastcompanion/","1043 products in account","I bought Super Galaxy Squadron based mostly on the excellent art, music, and the fact that it looked like it might offer some good challenge and design.  I am so incredibly disappointed.\n\nThe game is not without merits.  The visuals are great. The music is nice.  The audio is superb, with great sounds as you blow up enemy ships.  There are even some good mechanics.  Shooting missiles during boss fights to refill hyper gauge is great fun (and the bosses have destructible parts, hooray!).  There's a bunch of ships to choose from.  Lots of good stuff going on here.\n\nAll of those good elements are what leave me feeling so utterly baffled by this game.  It's got so many of the elements necessary to make a really fun shoot em up, yet it's plagued with a host of amateur-hour mistakes.  The developers clearly understand many of the things that make shmups so much fun, so why all the mistakes that even a rookie shmupper would be appalled by?\n\nFirst problem is the terrible control scheme.  To begin with, there is no control remapping, or even several schemes available.  I wanted to play on the same arcade stick I use for every game, but the dpad isn't supported as a movement option, and the buttons are mapped with a controller in mind, so if I wanted to use Hyper attacks, I'd be reaching across to my shoulder buttons on stick.  As if the lack of control customization wasn't baffling enough, SGS uses analog controls.  For players unfamiliar with shmups and why this is a problem, remember that this is a genre about precision and lots of small movements.  With analog controls, that precision is flung out of the window, since two taps of the stick can be yield different results based on how far you moved the stick.  With digital controls, it's entirely based on how long  you hold the stick, giving you fewer variables to deal with when moving, and ultimately lending the game greater control.  Without this, SGS feels like a sloppy mess.\n\nSGS also has obnoxiously sturdy enemies.  Even the basic popcorns can't be taken down in a single hit, and the larger enemies can sustain fire for ridiculous lengths.  It's extremely frustrating, leading to a lot of sitting in one area, waiting for that needlessly tanky enemy to go down.  Bosses are what really exemplify this, with them lasting absurd, huge lengths of time, repeating the same handful of patterns over and over while you slowly drift into sleep.\n\nI also encountered a few other horrible design choices.  The second level is full of asteroids floating down to hit you.  Unfortunately, there are also harmless asteroids in the background.  The difference between the two was a fairly subtle change in the color of brown, so it was extremely difficult to know at a glance if an asteroid would kill me or not.  Asteroids?  Fine.  Background asteroids?  Fine.  Both at once?  Horrific.\n\nAnother awful little problem I noticed was on the second boss, who fired a huge laser.  No biggy.  I dodged it.  Only then the laser kept firing for an extremely long period of time as the boss slooooowly drifted towards me, completely trapping me on the side of the screen where I was forced to eat the laser.  Impossible to dodge unless you know in advance that the laser is going to fire for ages. (Or maybe I was supposed to shoot the laser to break it?  Seems unlikely, since breakable parts take hours to destroy).\n\nEither way, I don't think I'll ever learn the mystery of how to avoid the 10-hour laser, since immediately after dying, the game glitched and refused to respawn my ship.  Lovely.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun shmup on steam, give this a pass.  There are far better choices out there. (Crimzon Clover, Ikaruga, The Alltynex Trilogy, Satazius, Jamestown, etc).  Super Galaxy Squadron may look and sound nice, but that's really all its got going for it.","January 24, 2015","false","0.2"," 25 of 42 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","25","42","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shagz/recommended/345860/","shagz","[toj.cc]Shagz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shagz/","81 products in account","Super Galaxy Squadron is a great little "flow" shmup: you fall into a pattern of sweeping the screen left to right and back, blowing stuff up and picking up power ups.  It's a _little_ repetitive and the enemy attack patterns/level design don't vary enough to seriously knock you out of your zone, but this serves to create a pleasant state of zen-like focus and flow while playing. (Note: I'm a long-time player of shmups, so your state of zen, boredom, or extreme panic may vary depending on your experience with the genre and taste for difficulty...)\n\nThere's a simple combo/multiplier system, but it doesn't force me play the game strategically because the level design and enemy waves don't seem distinct enough to make strategies for maintaining your combo apparent to me.\n\nThe key source of variety comes from strong collection of different kinds of ships.  I haven't had a chance to try them all yet, but each requires a slightly different play style to pilot successfully.  The ships seem to range from standard shmup tropes to more creative and unique attack types.  The different ships provide a good source of replay value, outside of leaderboard climbing.\n\nGraphics and audio are excellent, couldn't ask for more from a retro-inspired shmup!\n\nThe game's normal mode is pretty forgiving (a shmup beginner might not think so), and hardcore is of course hardcore. (one hit you're dead)\n\nAll in all a pretty good, well executed shmup at a good price!  Veterans might not find much meat on the bone, but this would be a good start for beginners to learn the basic skills required for the genre.","May 6, 2015","true","13.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Another big change is the update to the multiplier system, which only decreases your chain when the active chain meter hits 0 instead of flatout losing the entire thing. You can also go above x5 multiplier and keep chains more easily as it takes longer now before chaining becomes unforgiving in timing. Since there appears to be more of a legitimate scoring system with potential to carry it across entire stages, I can safely say that I would recommend this even at full price now.\n\nThis could be best described as a guilty pleasure SHMUP.  It is more laid back than a typical shmup due to the fact that you can't "lose" or "game over" in the arcade mode as you will simply restart the stage you died on with score intact if you die.  Normal uses health for your ship, while Hardcore is a one hit then restart the stage ordeal.  The local scores saved don't differentiate Normal and Hardcore, so there's no particular reason to try Hardcore unless you want a challenge.\n\nIt is fun to take all of the ships for a spin and see what they are capable of, but there isn't too much really keeping people on here for an extended period of time after that.  Endless Normal is the most fun in the long run because you'll compete with others on the steam leaderboard there and it just becomes funny to see how ridiculously stacked the odds become against you once you live longer than 15 minutes.","June 17, 2015","true","15.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monotoli/recommended/345860/","monotoli","BonusLord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monotoli/","378 products in account","Overall a great little shmup game.  Most games in this genre devote very little effort to storytelling, and while I wouldn't exactly call SGS a story-heavy game, I found myself getting into the world/story far more than I do with typical shmups.  My favorite touch was the couple sentences of backstory provided for each of the 14 playable ships on the ship select screen; amazing how much depth that adds to the game's world.\n\nThe soundtrack, created by Random Encounter, is fantasic, though it would've benefited from a couple more tracks. (Finish the game for an extra special version of the title theme~)\n\nThe game plays very tight and is filled with beautfiul, crisp 16-bit sprites. The difficulty curve feels just about perfect although veteran shmup players will probably be bored for the first few stages.\n\nThis is a symptom of the one real problem I had with the game: the lack of a deep scoring system. Typically shmups feature some sort of complex scoring dynamic that calls for some specific strategy to maximize your scoring (for example the spectacular "Vaunt" scoring system in Jamestown); this gives higher skill players something to go for on easier stages where survival isn't really a concern. SGS sports a very simple combo system that rewards you for killing enemies in quick succession (before your combo meter resets).  Unfortunately, the player really has very little control over maintaining a combo due to the way the enemies spawn and ultimately most players will end up ignoring the combo meter entirely. Even something as simple as being able to slow down or freeze your combo meter by letting go of the fire button would make going for high scores much more interesting.\n\nDespite the lack of scoring depth, I'd still highly recommend this to anyone remotely interested in a good arcadey experience.  This game's difficulty makes more accessible than the average shmup a is great bridge to more difficult games like Ikaruga and Gradius.","February 14, 2015","true","4.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I have only played EX, and not the original version of the game.\n\nI recommend this game, but with a few caveats.  First, the good:  The pixel art of the graphics is very well done.  Every ship, enemy, background, and attack looks good.  The music is amazing.  You could play this game just to listen to the music and it would probably be worth it.  There are 14 ships to choose from, and that is a huge plus.  Each has its own pilot with a couple-sentence long story that adds some flavor to the game.  I appreciated this touch.  The Endless mode is another plus for this game; it makes a fun little diversion when you are low on time but really want to just shoot stuff up.\n\nNow, for the negative...backgrounds and enemies do get repetitive.  Many levels have the same enemies and while each level has a unique background, some have no transitions and those that do have only 1 or 2.  This can make the levels, especially the first 4 or so, kind of boring and repetitive.  If you play on Hell difficulty you may not notice the lack of variety so much, but you will definitely get used to the same enemies and attack patterns.  Speaking of attack patterns, this game bills itself as not really a bullet hell, and that is mostly true on the stages.  There are alot of patterns that aren't necessarily dense but require fast dodging, kind of like what might be seen in a Raiden game.  Then, on the bosses, there are some patterns similar to those "fast dodging" games, but also other patterns straight outta Touhou.  This game definitely treads on bullet hell territory on the bosses, which makes for a somewhat jarring experience.  Another issue I had in terms of difficulty, is the second attack pattern on the next to last boss on Veteran and Hell difficulties.  I got to the final stage and first boss pretty easily on veteran, but I cannot fathom how to dodge this pattern.  It was like all of a sudden the game jumped in difficulty tremendously.  I am fine with hard games, especially in a shmup but the very sudden spike really frustrates me (I still can't beat this boss).  I figured I would try the game on Hell for a different kind of challenge....and I still reached the boss, granted, not as quickly as on Veteran, but I didn't have any major troubles either.  Even on Hell, the difficulty spikes so high on that second attack pattern.  To make this even more frustrating, the official video on youtube for this game which demonstrates the sixth stage is actually missing this attack pattern for some reason, which really confuses me.  On novice, it can be cleared fairly easily, so I was at least able to see the ending.  And speaking of the ending...it had no cutscene, a super short conclusion, and no voiced content (whereas stage transitions did have these), so it felt very anticlimatic.  It really feels like the very end game needs a little more work.\n\nOverall this game is worth the money, just don't be expecting a masterpiece.  Do expect a great soundtrack and good times to be had playing 14 different ships!","March 2","true","5.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Yes I know the trailer says "Not bullet hell", but just watch a video of the final boss and you'll get what I mean by "a tiny bit of bullet hell".\n\nKeep in mind there's no control rebinding, so if you're someone who hates arrow keys, then you might need to take that into consideration. Personally I'd like to rebind the super to X, but it's no big deal. Arrow keys, Z, and spacebar is a sensible enough control scheme for me.\n\nIn any case, I love the music, the graphical style, and the sound design. Plus I appreciate the selection of 14 ships each with its own set of stats and weapons.\n\nThe game is a lot more forgiving than most games of its type in that when you die you just restart the stage you're on, and if you quit the game you can actually come back and pick up from the start of the stage you were on. Also, your ship can take more than one hit (on normal mode). It can actually take quite a few hits, and enemies (and their missiles) can drop health when destroyed.\n\nWhen you get hit you'll drop one of your acquired firepower power ups, which after a couple of seconds will be available for you to pick up again. This actually adds an interesting dynamic, in that you probably want to pick up that power up, but you're probably going to have to weave through a shower of bullets to get to it... and if you get hit then you're just going to drop more power on top of taking more damage. Of course, none of this matters in hardcore mode because getting shot will just kill you then.\n\nHonestly, I don't have a whole lot of cohesive thoughts to give about the game (as you can likely see above).  All I can say is that I really like it.","June 8, 2015","true","7.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

A lot of my previous concerns like the music not looping cleanly appears to have been fixed as well. Same goes for the tweaked bosses, the overall difficulty of the game with the new difficulty settings, as well as the improved hardcore mode. The fact that it is a free major update is great of the developer to do as well. It's exactly what the game needed.\n\nIt has become an enjoyable game. Looking forward to checking out the new modes that are still on the way. I will get the sequel too whenever that comes out.\n\n\nOld review for Super Galaxing Squadron classic:\n\nSuper Galaxy Squadron is not bad, but it's less than what I expected it to be.\n\nNormal Mode is not a big challenge as it feels like the life bar lasts forever (I reached the stage 6 boss second form on the first try and cleared the game on the 2nd attempt), while in Hardcore mode from what I could tell if you get hit once you have to start the level over. I think my skill level is probably more at a middle ground between the two, but the game doesn't offer this.\n\nThe art is nice but I only noticed 1 enemy ship (pink one) which was actually animated. The music was decent but not very memorable. Only the title screen music and the stage 6 music stood out for me, although some of the music did not loop naturally.\n\nThe power up system wasn't fun for me. The power ups dropped by enemies don't fall down to you, they just kind of sit there and move a small amount before fading away. If you get hit you will also usually lose one of your powerups, which fly upwards and can't be picked up again for a couple of seconds. The tried and true hyper system is fine though and the ships do feel a bit different from each other, although I only tried a handful of them.\n\nHowever, the worst part about the game is the bosses. The boss patterns are boring. Aside from the stage 5 and 6 bosses, the rest just repeat the one pattern over and over. The stage 6 boss was the best out of all, and although I did feel like I had seen the patterns before in other games, I liked it and wished the same attention had been given to the other bosses as well.\n\nI found the most enjoyment in endless mode, since I was able to zone out and fly around shooting things and dodging bullets, without having to face any of the bosses.\n\nIn all, I would say that the game is worth a try. You may like it more than I did. But it's not something I can see myself coming back to or getting friends to play.","March 18, 2015","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","7"

What's changed? Just about everything! It's a real do over. Everything has been made to look better, gauges and icons have been added to help you keep better track of your health and power levels. New enemies, better level designs and actual story!\n\nWhere Super Galaxy Squadron EX stands above other games is in two main ways; It's difficulty curve allowing  new players to be eased into a difficult genre and it's ship selection. I can't stress how important that new player experience is. If you like bullet hell games then you already know what you're after and what you're looking for. But if you don't? Then Super Galaxy Squadron EX is just what you need.\n\nThe different ships also allow for a variety of play styles. Whilst the core mechanic of 'hold down the fire button and move out of the way of all the dangerous things' stays the same the variations in the ships means you can change things up fairly dramatically. You might want a slow ship that packs a massive punch and can take a fair few hits or you might prefer a super fast, low damage ship where you do more dodging and only take down key targets. You can change your ship at the start of a mission so you can take on different missions in different ways.\n\nThe base game was pretty good. EX has made everything that much better, it could easily be Super Galaxy Squadron 2 and I don't think anyone would have been angry. But instead it's been released as a free upgrade to the original game! Whilst it's maybe not for diehard Bullet Hell fans for a first entry into a genre there isn't much of a better choice.\n\n------------------------------------------------\nDisclaimer: The review key for this product was provided by the developer free of charge.\nCheck out this review and others at Nouse Gaming: http://www.nouse.co.uk/muse/gaming/\n","February 16","true","2.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I used to love these games in the arcade so playing it was nostalgic.\n\n+Challenging:\nGames like this are always a bit challenging, so thats good.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Volume Resets Itself:\nThe volume, out of the box, is loud as hell. If you turn it down, close and then relaunch the game, the volume will reset to default. The slider will say its lower, but you'll need to tinker with it again to get it lower.\n\n-Boring?:\nI don't know, I found this boring. Maybe on the harder modes its more adreneline pumping, but the overall experience for me so far has been eh.\n\n-Music:\nThe music isn't that great and just repeats the same song over and over again until you finish the level. Bosses have boss music, each map has a unique song, but all of them aren't that great/kinda annoying.\n\nOverall: 5/10\n\nIf you're looking for a game with a amazing story, look else where. This game is straight to the point. Pick a ship that suits your taste, blasts things to hell while avoiding a screen full of lasers, bombs and plasma blasts. It supports both keyboard and gamepad and I really recommend using a gamepad if ya got one. Overall, its a pretty good time waster, but I honestly didn't find it that compelling.","April 25","false","5.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Takes forever to be defeated.\n\n- Lack of lives, you die in some point close to the end of stage, you restart at the beginning, even on normal mode.\n\n- By mid stage 3 you get hit by enemy and right away you get a heath item, you dont feel to be hit anytime actually, looks like you are invincible up to this point.

Besides jrpgs, they were what I played when I was young, and I feel a lot of vertical shmups lately have lost the arcade feel. They\'re inventive and offer new things, but nothing\'s brought me back to nostalgiaville like SGS has.\n\nI originally backed this game when it was in the Kickstarter phase. In their video, they discussed wanting to make a shmup that brought the old-style feel into it. That\'s what sold me, and they delivered.\n\nThe music is by my favorite local band, Random Encounter, which is an extreme added bonus.\n\nI would recommend this game to old and new shmup lovers, especially those that fell in love with vertical shmups like Fever SOS, Viper Phase 1, and Xevious.","June 1","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
