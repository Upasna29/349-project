If you ever played Swords & Soldiers, Angry Birds and any other tower defense game - and enjoyed them - CastleStorm is the game for you.\n\nWhat it basically comes down to, if you haven't played any of those games, is this:\nYou're the good guy, you own the castle on the left (or right, depending on the mission). Your opponent owns the other, opposite, castle. You both own a ballista that can shoot about 9 or so different ammo types.\n\nThe goal is usually to destroy the other castle. This can be done by shooting projectiles at it. Damage it enough and the physics will take over, destroying rooms in the process. These rooms are filled with troops, by the way. Destroy a room with a specific troop and your enemy can't summon those anymore.\n\nTroops can be send to help destroy the castle gate, after which they can then steal the flag. Capturing and returning a flag also results in victory. You can also send your troops to just distract your enemy.\n\nYou also own a hero that can be spawned on the battlefield to slay the troops of your enemy. You can summon them for about 20 seconds; after that they disappear and you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can summon them again.\n\nMissions have secondary objectives, keeping the missions fun and varied, while also giving them replayability.\n\nOf course, a tower defense game isn't a tower defense game without upgrades. Thankfully, there are plenty of things to upgrade; projectiles, troops, heroes, spells, your castle, you name it.\n\nThe sounds are funny and the textures are beautifully sharp and detailed. It's a gorgeous looking game, in its own way, of course. You can't compare it to, let's say, Crysis (obviously). That would just be silly... ...\n\nLike I said CastleStorm took me by surprise. It's been a long time since I had so much mindless fun with a game ♥\n\n[Rating: 85/100]","August 15, 2013","true","9.4"," 144 of 169 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","144","169","0","0"

Pump out troops, cast spells, load the ballista with weird ammo and assume direct control of heroes to wipe the battlefield. The best bit is the artillery, lob stones to smash enemy spires to loose parts which then will hopefully crush the enemy army as they are leaving their castle. There are four factions (with DLC) with different troops/spells/artillery. You can either try to storm the enemy castle with troops, stealing their flag and bringing it home in a tug of war, or you can just simply smash the enemy castle with boulders until there's nothing left. It's just fun and the physics are meaty enough, who wouldn't enjoy breaking things? Lots of opportunity for amazing skillshots or stupid accidents when your ballista hits your own troops. You can also design your own castle, the room choices affect your troop loadout and bonuses.\n\nThe four singleplayer campaigns were good enough, but when you enter multiplayer the game commits suicide. Local splitscreen can only be done in tiny windows, leaving lots of the screen unused and black. It was probably to preserve the FOV ratio but the end result is completely unappealing. Online multiplayer then is tied to playing ranked matchmaking, if you want to customize and upgrade your loadout playing with just friends doesn't earn you anything. I don't know why they went this way, did they expect to turn this into e-sports? Multiplayer seems quite dead even during sales...\n\nAll in all a very enjoyable time, for some reason I'd compare it with Orcs Must Die even though it's a different type of defense game. The art, humour and design is somehow similar and very polished. There's a nice pile of content and game modes in the complete pack for singleplayer, however if you're interested only in multiplayer I'd say skip it and get something like King Arthur's Gold instead.","December 30, 2013","true","17.7"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","42","46","0","2"

You play to ear credits to level up skills and can even build your own castle. Eventually you get all stars on all maps, and all skills, and you are still left with an onsluaght-style game which is chaotic and challenging. Single player? Thumbs Up!\n\nMultiplayer however, is a seriously broken, unfun joke. You are given 20k credits. Once you spend them, they are gone - you cannot gain new skills, you cannot reset your 20k to buy different items... EVER.  Playing against friends? You gain no credits, so theres no reason to play with them.\n\nThe only way to get new credits is to play "ranked" matches which pit you randomly against other players (level 1 vs level 100 anyone?)- and in ranked matches you cannot even choose your opponents, so forget about ever playing with friends.\n\nMultiplayer is horribly designed and very broken, slow and utterly fail, and unless you get this game at a steep discount, or dont mind playing by yourself, I'd say "avoid"\n\n","April 9, 2014","false","34.4"," 107 of 153 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","107","153","2","0"

I've been addicted by it straight away from the beginning. It's sometimes rare for a game that you start it and you don't want to quit it already after 10 minutes, because there is just something taken away your motivation. Actually, I would say that more than half of my library gives me this feeling not to continue playing after some minutes. But CastleStorm just does everything right you would expect from such an angry birds, Ballerburg, etc. mix. You can level up, the design is pretty, a lot of levels, you improve your skills, your tactics, etc... okay, the story part is redundant, but does not bother you further as you can easily skip it. So it is not annoying. I got the game for 5 EUR and I simply say, it has been the best 5 EUR I spent on this winter sale. I give it clearly 8 / 10 points and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys simple games with great ideas.","December 23, 2013","true","19.3"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","38","48","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/241410/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","I still remember how few years ago 2D lane pushers appeared in form of free Flash browser games and got relatively popular. (If you don't know what I'm talking about - you fight opponent's fortress by spawning minions that want to do the hard work.) Zen Studios took this formula but added more to it, to make a great mashup of well-known subgenres. You don't just spawn minions to attack the enemy's castle, you also control the ballista of your castle to kill enemy minions, or to destroy the opponent's castle in Angry Birds style. But that's still not enough, your hero can also get off the ballista and go into fight himself. CastleStorm is a great combination that won't give you a rest, you'll still have something to do.\n\nSo, it's always a fight between castles with last man standing, is that all? Definitely not, there are many objectives that will lead you to victory - behind every castle's gate is a flag that will also achieve you a victory if your army takes it to you. In other levels, you have to protect yourself against waves of enemies, or you just have to hunt wolves (or deadly bosses). There are always two specific objectives for each level - one mandatory, one voluntary being usually something like "spawn swordsmen a lot" or "destroy enemy castle in three minutes".\n\nThe story revolves around a war between knights and vikings but there's nothing to be taken seriously since every cutscene have a gag prepared for you. That, with combination of nice graphics and sounds, make overall good comedy mood between the battles.\n\nThe fact that you use ballista to attack the enemy doesn't mean that you would just have to stick with big arrows. There are plenty of ammunition types to choose from, each upgradable! That applies also for your army and magic skills of your hero. Members of your army and passive bonuses are decided by rooms in your castle which you'll build yourself. Of course, you can use a pre-made castle, but it feels great to build your own, with your personal selection of rooms for the best strategy.\n\nConclusion:CastleStorm offers good amount of levels to keep you entertained for hours, especially if you will try to beat all optional level objectives and finish side quests. The gameplay keeps being dynamic, as you'll have to switch between ballista, your hero, and control of your barracks (to spawn your minions). There are also two DLCs which add even more levels. CastleStorm is worth buying.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 10","true","7.0"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kahmu/recommended/241410/","kahmu","Kahmu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kahmu/","298 products in account","My thoughts on Castlestorm:\n\nYou'll be playing the good guy knight who's charged with the heroic task to defend the king's castle from the evil attackers. To do so, you're given four tools: an army, a ballista, yourself and the castle.\n\nLet's start with the castle editor. You'll be given a set of pre-made castles that you can use or edit, but you can also build your own castle from scratch. To do so, you have several rooms, each representing a certain kind of soldier or creature that may only be used in battle if its room has been built into your castle. More rooms are unlocked throughout the campaign, and you'll have some sctructures for visual und defensive purposes.\nDuring the campaign (or multiplayer) you can now use all those units whose room you've added to your building to fend off enemy units. The are knights, archers, birds and dragons, rock giants and other cool stuff to throw at your enemies gates. The stronger the unit the more expensive it is, so summoning the right amount of them and the right composition is crucial.\nSpeaking of throwing: Your ballista does not only shoot arrows but can also be equipped with rocks to damage the enemy castle, rainbow farting sheeps, exploding apples and several other things to defend your gates. At some point I felt like the ballista was too strong of a weapon because if used correctly it can kill some of the most expensive units by itself.\nIf things get harsh you can summon one of several heroes onto the battlefield, controlled by yourself, to slash through the enemy troops. After a certain amount time or once your hero dies you'll be back to shooting the ballista and summoning units.\n\nThe game is won/lost, once an army has managed to either break into the opposing gate and steal the flag, or a castle has been destroyed to the point where no room is left and thus no units can be summoned anymore.\nThroughout the campaign you'll have some limitations, like you'll only be able to use the ballista, or you may only use soldiers, but that's as far as variety goes. There are some levels with a special boss, and some where you have to fulfill a certain task, but that's it.\nEach level gives you gold depending on how well you perform, and you'll get some extra gold if you could complete a challence like never miss an arrow, let the flag steal by a certain kind of unit and so on.\nMost of the time, there is nothing special though. What makes the game so addicting is the joy of hitting a headshot with your arrows, the fun dialogues between the levels and the several unlocks like new rooms or even a new race (is exactly the same but looks different).\n\nGraphics are good and so is the music. Okay game for killing some time, not good if you plan on playing it for more than two hours at once because most missions feel the same.\nBuy it when on sale!","July 31, 2013","true","8.7"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","0"

The problem with this game is that the mulitplayer is dead, the skrimish with AI is lackluster and there is nothing else after you finish the campaigns. So no real replayability.

This game is a combination of many other games such as angry birds, army of darkness, Age of War and tower defense games. I would highly recommend this game if you have a couple of days to spare and have nothing to do.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe campaign was satisfyingly long and does not feel draggy at all since most of the mission has a different and unique objective. Coupled with the DLCs, this game will give you a solid entertainment for a couple of days.\nThe storyline was very interesting and the characters are all very lovable. The substantial amount of humour in the dialogue was very entertaining.\nBesides shooting catapults trying to destroy the enemy's castle, you can spawn heroes which you can control on the battlefield. You can also spawn a variety of soldiers to aid you in the battle.\nMultiplayer support so you can play with your friends after you have beaten the campaign. However, there are not many online players at the moment. So you have to get a friend to play it with you.\nMusic\n\nWhen I was playing this game, I heard a very familiar music on the background. As I went to research, in turns out that the music was composed by the same artist that created the music for the flash game Age of War. The music was indeed a remastered version of the Age of War theme music. I used to play that game alot during high school and I delighted to hear that music again in this game.\nThe other music was very fitting to the game and its quirky characters.

A fat friar asked me to polish his "ballista" with dragon excrement.\n\nSeriously, the only complaint I have about this game is that you pretty much have to complete the campaign to be viable in multiplayer.  This is because you unlock most of your weapons / troops / etc by playing campaign mode. If you watch TotalBiscuit's review of the game, he agrees that this is one of the main "aggravations" of the game.\n\nOverall the game is fun, but be prepared to spend 4-5 hours beating the campaign before stepping in to demolish your friends.  The campaign itself is written well, with a load of hillarious cut-scenes, and fun missions that give you a different obstacle to overcome each time (use different weapons, use only troops, etc).\n\nThe mix of gameplay is something pretty new to me.  At it's heart it is a castle-defense game, but it has parts where you'll be playing a hack-and-slash platformer too.  And during heated battles, it begins to feel more like an RTS than anything else.\n\nHere's hoping more people pick this game up, as the multiplayer is sort of under-attended and very under-rated at the moment.\n\nI look forward to playing vs you in the future.

The campaign consists of controlling a hero/ballista to attack another castle to side quests of killing boars to raiding a gold mine before your opponent and his castle get to it. You can design your own castles and edit them which is a cool design to the game. My favorite part though is being able to launch rocks or an apple bomb at the opposing enemy castle. Different bombs or upgrades obviously give you different effects. There are some power ups meant to blast through linearly while others will try to take down everything in proximity. While your throwing things at the castle or the enemies players, you can send your own players from archers to magicians to knights to a freakin' dragon. Throughout the game you can upgrade certain aspects of a castle (bigger army, more food generation, shorter wait time on ballistic objects), units, or your hero player. A hero player can be called into battle when they are charged up and ready to go. You cannot control your ballista while you are fighting with your hero. I do commend the game for doing this as somehow again, RTS can meet with FPS.\n\nThe art style is nothing short of well done. The graphics aren't next gen, but do provide for a colorful atmosphere. The sounds all seem well tended to and appropriate for their delivery. When a rock hits a castle wall, it sounds like a rock hitting a castle wall.\n\nWould recommend buying it on sale for sure! It's a local co-op too that works well with the controller!\n\nRATING : 8/10","July 21, 2014","true","5.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I don't even know how to describe it, except that it involves elements of side-scrollers, hack and slash, arcade shooters, tower defense and Angry Birds -- and somehow that all works together in a pretty addictive and playable game. The graphics are really colorful and well-done, and the interface is pretty smooth once you get the hang of all the things that are going on and switching around between the different modes (ballista, hero, troops, etc.). The story is one of those "so cheesy it's awesome" sort of things, but it's the gameplay that will keep you coming back for more.\n\nLoads of fun, totally recommend it.

The story is pretty silly and so are the cutscenes and I personally enjoy both. You can skip them if you'd like, however.\n\nAs you progress through the story you earn all sorts of weapons, troops, and spells.

Parts tower defense, strategy, RPG and action. This game strives to achieve a hefty goal. I can say it achieve that goal on many levels. Despite the story and what some may consider short campaign mode, this game offers plenty. There are many modes to it, the art style is very eye catching and the humor kept me in. I loved that you could upgrade magic, projectiles, soldier types and the castle itself (It isn't "CastleStorm" for nothing). The balancing one has to do to achieve their own gameplay style is unique with the castle building. I won't go into detail, but it is a nice and fresh take on it.\n*If I could make any improvements, longer campaign, more variety in soldiers or at least a 3rd faction.\nAll in all, I found this game a wonderful time had. Glad I purchased it. I needed a fix like this that I didn't know I wanted.\n\n\n** They may have added some in the DLC for the game, which is very cheap and probably worth it, but I had not purchased it as of this review, I wanted to review what I had played.","February 13, 2014","true","9.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Selenography/recommended/241410/","Selenography","Selenography","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Selenography/","653 products in account","This is a very decent little game that looks like it's suited to mobile platforms, but has far more depth than that.\n\nCastlestorm is a mix of real-time tower defense and sidescrolling hack'n'slash, but the former is much more prominent when you actually play the game. The gist of it is that you need to prevent enemies from walloping down your castle gates and taking your flag back to their own castle - everything is on a 2D plane, a straight left/right path. You can do this in multiple, often very creative ways - but the three staples are using your castle ballista to shoot enemies manually, sending out your own soldiers to die valiantly in the line of duty, and controlling your own powerful general out on the battlefield. While the latter is fun, the castle projectile system is what you'll be using the majority of the time.\n\nYou'll be using your array of projectiles to deliver more headshots than Liebovitz, but it isn't just limited to bog-standard ballistas. Yes, you can fire a potion to turn that enemy griffin into a harmless turkey, and yes you can shower that viking brute with a barrage of kitchen utensils. The options are surprisingly varied and most of them have their uses, with different factions having differing projectiles available. You unlock these, the soldier classes and other spells/buffs by accumulating gold throughout the campaign and skirmishes, which are then used to upgrade your wares. These also include castle rooms - ballistas can fire at the opposing castle as well as enemy units, and if a room in the castle is destroyed, then whatever benefit it gave to your forces is immediately gone. This can include your army, of course...\n\nThe campaign is a good length, and the missions are reasonably varied although it might get slightly wearing towards the end. I would say that the DLC is worth it if you enjoy the game, as it's pretty cheap but opens up two new campaigns and factions to play around with. The story is pretty standard questing fare, although it plays around with tropes in good humour. Multiplayer is almost completely dead, so count on a single player experience only.\n\nOn the whole, Castlestorm is a good game that defies expectations. It looks like a kiddy iOS game, but actually gets quite difficult at points and utilises its own game mechanics well. I'd recommend it to most people who fancy a somewhat casual 2D tower defense. Also, Freia is awesome.\n\n'They've smashed ah rhume in yer cah-sull!'","April 18, 2015","true","22.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/241410/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This review is a little lengthy, so if you just want a quick summary of why I recommend CastleStorm skip to Results and read from there.\n\nZen Studies hits gold with Castlestorm the epic 2D strategy game. Castlestorm offers a brilliant game that combines strategy, hack ‘n slash, castle design, and action. This brilliant game offers DLC packs which add two additional campaigns.\n\nStory:\nThe two Teardrop Gems, blue for the knights and red for the Vikings, offer each army protection and have created peace across the land. Out of nowhere the terms of alliance have shifted as the princess has been kidnapped. It is the job of Sir Gareth, a knight for the Kingskeep, who must fight the forces of evil who kidnapped the kings beautiful daughter. With obvious plot twists and simple but amusing dialogue CastleStorm really offers a beautifully playful story. As you work with Friar Vic, Lord Rufus (who everyone hates), and eventually the heroine Freia you fight your way across the land to defeat the Viking lord and restore peace to the land.\n\nGameplay:\nCastleStorm is similar to a 2D tower defense game where you control the tower; although, CastleStorm has the added twist where you can jump in as a hero and turn the game into a 2D hack ‘n slash game. With a total of nine weapons, nine spells, nine troops, and nine special rooms you get the option to outfit your army to your own unique play style. You can choose a total of five weapons, five spells, and five troops each battle although you can outfit your castle with as many rooms as you can fit. There are unlockable castle layouts you can get by beating missions. But, in all honesty the unlocked castle designs are completely useless as you will find you can build your own that allow you to better utilize the optimal layout (allowing you to get all the special rooms and troops you desire).\n\nCampaign:\nThe original game includes two campaigns: Kingdom Quest and Welcome to Vikingland. Kingdom quest includes ten levels each averaging about four missions. Each mission allows for new unlocks, obtaining gold, and garnishing new information from the story. In Kingdom Quest you play as the Knights army and you fight against the Vikings. Welcome to Vikingland includes four levels each averaging about six missions. In this part of the campaign you switch sides and play as the Vikings, but you also fight against Vikings and occasionally on bonus missions you fight the evil knights. This completes the campaign to CastleStorm, with about 1/3 of the missions being bonus missions gives a great amount of variety and twists to the campaign. Each DLC pack adds an additional campaign with two semi-new teams.\n\nFrom Outcast to Savior:\nThe story picks up where it left off as you play Sir Gavin, son of the traitor Sir Gareth. You take up the job as head of security for the kings’ guard in order to restore your fathers honor. The campaign totals six levels averaging about three missions per level. As you fight your way through the depths of evil you must defeat the evil villain who started this whole crisis. From Outcast to Savior runs hand in hand with The Warrior Queen in that the final mission is essentially the same in both campaigns but rather is how it would play out if Sir Gavin fought instead of Freia.\n\nThe Warrior Queen:\nThe story picks up where it left off as you play Freia, daughter of the great Viking rebellions leader. It is your job as Freia to free the Vikings and reunite the Viking rebellion to thwart the evil that had claimed the land. As you fight your way through seven fun packed levels averaging three missions per level you unveil to story of how it all began. The Warrior Queen runs hand in hand with From Outcast to Savior in that the final mission is essentially the same in both campaigns but rather is how it would play out if Freia fought instead of Sir Gavin.\n\nResults:\nCastleStorm is a fantastic game, which even at full price is not a bad buy. Although, CastleStorm does go on sale often and if you can get it for over 60% off then I wouldn’t hesitate for a second. If you are a fan of 2D tower defenses, where you control the tower, then this is CastleStorm is the game for you. If you like to 2D hack n’ slash games then this is the game for you. CastleStorm offers many features: designing your own castle, building an army, upgrading fortifications, manning defenses, and running around as a hero slaying the armies ahead. This game has a lot to offer and with two DLC expansions CastleStorm offers a story that doesn’t quit, keeping you laughing and wanting to see what happens next.\n\nPros:\n+Castle builder, which lets you customize your own castle and test out if it would stand an onslaught.\n+Simple, non-offensive campaign that offers good laughs and cute story.\n+Two DLC packs which offer two additional campaigns.\n+Versus mode (although I never tried it so it may be terrible).\n+Unit upgrades which make you focus resources and keep you playing.\n+Summoning hero to battlefield which lets you play as a hero and destroy the enemies ahead.\n+Decent graphics, not too much detail but enough to make it look clean.\n+Decent video settings allowing windowed mode with various resolutions.\n\nCons:\n-To get perfect 5-star ratings you need to grind your castle, there is no way you could do it without spending time grinding up your castle a little bit.\n-The earned castle layouts seem almost worthless as you will find yourself almost always using custom layouts because you will want an efficient castle rather than a good looking castle.\n","April 14, 2014","true","24.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You can win a level by destroying the enemy castle completely in an Angry Birds style where you lob various types of "missiles" from your ballista/catapult.  You can also win by breaking down their castle door and sending troops in to get their flag and deliver it to your castle.  There's a few other missions here and there where you also play the main here ala a hack'n slash, beat'em up, brawler.\n\nEach of the styles are entertaining and no level is very long, and there's many many different levels so it remains an entertaining, changing game.  Very well done.\n\nIn the typical level, you can focus on destroying the enemy castle using your ballista/catapult and it's various artillery it throws from the single spear, to the multi-spear throw, to exploding drums, to large rocks, etc.  You select which types of missiles to equip at the start of each level, and also which to spend earned gold on upgrading them.  So if you favor a particular missile, you can upgrade that one up to 10 times so it does far more damage.  Generally the more damage a missile does, the longer the cool-off period.\n\nAnother way to win the level is by sending your troops toward the enemy castle -- breaking its door down, and bringing that castle's flag back to your castle.  So instead of upgrading missiles, you can upgrade your wide-variety of soldiers by making them do more damage and have more health, etc.\n\nSo while you are using your ballista to knock the enemy's castle down and break down the door for your troops and also sending your troops to capture the enemy flag, the enemy is doing both of the same to your castle.   If they destroy the room in your castle that allowed you to send forth your Archers, then you can't send out any more archers, etc.  So each room in your castle has a function.  Lose the room, then you lose that function or bonus.\n\nBoth styles of defeating the enemy are entertaining, and all done in a comedic story and appropriate artwork.  Every level has a (skippable) video introduction, progressing the story along.\n\nAll this, and I haven't even mentioned the ability to design and create your own castles, or mentioned the various spells used to defeat the enemy troops, or placing yourself (ala the hero) onto the battlefield and fighting first-hand, or the many types of troops that you and the enemy have.\n\nThe Good:+ Fun, entertaining game\n+ Multiple play styles supported -- Angry Birds castle knock down, and Capture the Flag ala Tower Defense\n+ Variety.  Many variety of missiles, troops and enemies\n+ Nice length.  The campaign took me 8.3 hours and while each level is short, there's many of them in a wide-variety of missions and goals.\n+ Artwork and style.\n+ Well polished game.  Animated intros on every level.  Nice.\n+ Design your own castle.  So you can customize and protect your most valuable rooms the way you wish.\n+ Castle rooms determine troops available.\n+ Upgrade, Upgrade, Upgrade!  You can upgrade, missiles, troops, rooms and their abilities, your spells, your "hero" character.\n\nThe OK:~ No narration.  The videos, while animated use text boxes for all speech.\n~ The DLCs.  The DLCs seemed to change the balance a bit and use much more of the hero fighting.  Which is okay, but I prefer knocking down and storming castles!  :-)\n\nThe Bad:- Nothing comes to mind...\n\nOverall:  This is a great little family-friendly game where I found it highly entertaining to knock down castles along a lengthy, well-paced and varied campaign .  8 out of 10.","April 30","true","21.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The basic premise is the same; you and your opponent control castles on either side of the map, and the goal is to send troops across to capture your opponent's flag. Each castle is also equipped with a ballista which can be loaded with all kinds of interesting ammunition, like javelins, stones, potions, and sheep.  The ballista can be used to kill enemy troops, or to destroy rooms in their castle (a la angry birds).\n\nThere's a host of different units, ammunition, castle rooms, and magic spells to choose from, and lots of stuff to upgrade.  And if you like, you can design your own castle to fit the rooms (and by extension bonuses) that you want.\n\nIt's all presented very well, with excellent graphics, great sound design, and a fantastic soundtrack from Waterflame (who incidentally created the song used in Age of War as well).  There are a lot of levels to play through, with bonus challenges to keep you coming back, and a scoring system that encourages you to find the most efficient way to complete a level.\n\nThe gameplay itself is also surprisingly deep.  Building your own castle lets you choose what types of units you want to use in the upcoming battle, and you can also swap out your ballista projectiles and magical spells to find the ones that suit your needs.\n\nDefinitely recommended, I've been having a lot of fun with this one.","January 11, 2014","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Multiplayer kinda.. sucks?\n\nTo explain, Survival modes are both incredibly bare bones. You cannot make your own castle first off. Having to rely on presets in order to do anything. Secondly, enemies upgrade after every wave, but you can not upgrade anything during a match. In fact, you can't even upgrade AFTER a match either. You have to close out a match entirely, make a NEW one, so that you can now spend your gold to upgrade things. Then you have to invite your friend back to play with you.. But wait! Its not that simple. If they want to upgrade their hero, they have to do it seperately as well.\n\nGameplay wise, the survival mode doesn't have anything honestly. Its just wave after wave of units slowly matching out of spawn to attack your base. Each wave has enemies getting stronger, but you staying the same. So much so that using units for anything but flag retrieval is pointless.\n\nHero Survival is basically the same, cept without the base to defend. Heroes are pretty bland, with only the norse chars even having a different special attack, and it all feels like the blandest beat em up you could ever hope to play.\n\nHaven't tried the single player yet, but if you buy this to play with friends, I'd definitely give this a pass.","May 18","false","3.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The only real problem is the lack of challenge, even on hard difficulty the game is very easy. Apart from the extremely annoying and frustrating melee missions where the devs take away everything that is good about the gameplay and replace it with a crappy, hard to control brawler. But thankfully there are only very few of those missions.\n\nStill a nice, relaxing game with lots of weapons/equipment/troops to unlock/upgrade over time (who doesn't love upgrading and unlocking stuff?).

The base mechanics of game do pander out into repetition after a while, and the AI units could be improved to add more to the game, ie have them attack the castles.\n\nBeing able to summon and control a hero is nice, but ultimately a waste of time as he does very little extra than a normal troop or ballistae could do. Lacklustre in execution.\n\nCastle design itself is flawed - there's no incentive to build anything more than a functional place to set down rooms. The towers serve no purpose besides catching shots, and the walls are restrained by the sheer crudeness of the engine (ie packing walls with rubble, strengthening and reinforcing via engineering? Not happening.)\n\nA good *casual* game. Worth a few dollars.

I'm a teacher and I was looking for a game which would keep me entertained during the recesses. This game is awesome for such short gaming bursts.\n\nIn short, you try to destroy the opponent's castle or capture their flag. You have different kinds of projectiles that you shoot with the ballista mounted on your castle gate, and you have different kinds of soldiers, including infantry, cavalry, siege units and monsters. You can either go for destroying the opposing castle room by room (the game has a very good physics engine, so if you somehow manage to destroy the basement of a castle, all of it comes tumbling down), or you can upgrade your soldiers and go for capturing the flag. There are two steps to capturing the flag, first you must break the castle gates, then you must escort the flag bearer to your castle.\n\nYou can design your castle in any way you can. You have only two limits while designing you castle; spatial limits and a limit of 5 different barracks at most. Other than that, you can create your castle however you want. If you don't feel like it, there are also ready castles that you can use, but I think they are inferior to what you can achieve yourself if you personalize your castle.\n\nI've encountered no bugs or glitches throughout my gameplay. The loading times were also very short.\n\nThere is almost no voice-over (just some generic sounds used many times) but the game never feels like it lacks it. The music also fits the game like a glove. It can be epic, funny or brooding depending on the mood of the moment.\n\nThe graphics are very cute and also hugely appropriate for a game of this kind. They are very, very reminiscent of Warcraft III, which I liked a lot. This game clearly proves that the most important thing in a game is gameplay, not the graphics.\n\nDon't expect miracles from the story. It's mediocre, and at times it really feels like it was written keeping children in mind. However, it at least manages to make you feel curious about what will happen next. The game also ends in a somewhat cliffhanger, so expect a sequel.\n\nThe only criticism I can make is not about the gameplay but the story:\n\nYou beat the Rogue Knight, Sir Brutus, and he pledges to serve you, but where does he or his army go? You just continue using the Barbarians' army-set like it never happened.\n\nAlso, all throughout the story, it was hinted very, very clearly that Lord Rufus is a traitor and Sir Brutus is actually working with him. What happened to Lord Rufus and Friar Vic when we were separated because of the cave-in? What happened on the other side of the mountain while we were fighting in the Barbarian lands?\n\nAnd what about the ending? What was the monster that we saw at the end? The developers could have at least described where it came from and why it appeared just after Ramhorn's death. And the ending roll says peace ruled the land but (as I've said in the previous paragraph) what happened with Lord Rufus, the traitor? These are not answered and I must say, it really bothered me.\n\nOther than these reservations, I think this is a very good game and it definitely deserves your money. Recommended.","March 28","true","8.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

You even get this nifty ballista able to fire a variety of weapons.  It can get quite addicting. The campaign story is hilariously entertaining, which I found to be an important part of CastleStorm holding my interest.\n\nUsually in strategy games I like to skip the campaign and go straight to the skirmish mode but CastleStorm doesn’t allow you to do that. Instead you have to play the campaign to unlock skirmish mode content which threw me off abit, but in the end I must admit the campaign is way more fun than skirmish mode.

I've seen this game on the Wii U Store, XBL and Steam and I've been thinking about getting it for awhile now. I purchased the complete package for only $5 and after playing it this week I think the game is well worth full price. I'm still enjoying the main game and haven't gotten to the DLC yet. The campaign is broken up into battles which are fairly short and quick to play through (at least on normal difficulty). The game offers the ability to have a quick match but sucks you into that "one more battle" mentality and before you know, it's 2 in the morning. The game progression has been fairly steady, the game is constently unlocking new items and upgrades to use and there is plenty of upgrading to be done throughout the campaign.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game enough","August 6, 2014","true","24.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Up to 2 for difficulty, up to 2 more for accuracy and the last bonus star is whatever the level doesn't want you to use, troops, ballista, magic, etc.\n\n\nThe bonus and accuracy takes away from the fun of it, you limit the weapons and I can't sloppily spam my shots?!  Would have been nice if they included something like time as part of it, and the star system based on a score system, so that if you reached X amount of points it would give you credit for X amount of stars, so that if you're lacking in some categories, like accuracy, you can make up for it in others like quickly beating the level.\n\n\nAll in all with the grindy nature of the game, it just seems like a big time sink and unenjoyable.  I have to replay these levels over and over again just to earn some points to upgrade my characters, very little of which make it skill based.  Rather they try to enforce the skill option by forcing you to be accurate.\n\nI would give a neutral if I could, but I can't recommend this game at $10, I think I got it for something like $2 which seems appropriate.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, the castlebuilding part is very glitchy/buggy, and NOWHERE near LEGOs like the description is implying.","October 24, 2015","false","1.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The mouse-based gameplay in the hero-mode is just unnecessarily frustrating, due to some poor design. When you're targeting, you often need to fire and move. That's good. But if you do, the cursor disappears entirely, so when you need to fire again, you have to find it, get it back on target, and then shoot. Also, the cursor disappears when you get hit, or release the button for whatever reason. To top that off, the screen scrolls around, making it difficult to tell where your enemies are. Normal mode ended up being way too easy, and hard mode would've worked, had it not been for the poor mouse control.\n\nMaybe I would've eventually gotten used to it. Still, I'd rather have fun with the design, rather than in spite of it.","August 14, 2014","false","0.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Some day I decided to give it a go again. I noticed some new updates like survival and highering the maximum upgrade level from 10 to I dont know, havent reached it yet.:) After having played in survival mode like 20 hours I was interested in how far others could survive and decided to google it. I clicked on the first search result in youtube and noticed right away, that the whole design was different than to mine, so I figured out that there is gotta be a PC or console version as well. When I found this game on Steam I instantly purchased it from a 3rd party seller for a few keys.\n\n\nSo after having played the mobile version for a few hundred hours and having played the PC version as well I decided that I should write a review on it to help others decide whether or not they should PURCHASE THIS VERSION ON PC OR STICK WITH THE MOBILE FREE TO PLAY VERSION.\n\nSo here is the summary of my impressions and opinions:\n\nMOBILE VERSION\n-/+ free to play, but partly pay to win\n-/+ due to the pay to win part, some ammunition types, units not achievable/upgradeable ---> game more difficult in general, especially in survival mode\n- less game modes (ONLY campaign and survival, NO multi-player/coop)\n\nPC VERSION\n- game has to be purchased for money\n+ no pay to win aspect, everything is achievable/upgradeable through playing the game\n+ a big variety of game modes (f. e. campaign, hero survival, coop hero survival, versus (your ballista, units, castle against someone else), coop survival (you have control over your units, ballista, magic spells, your friend controls a hero of his choice)\n\n\nOverall this game is a great little mix of different game types and definitely worth its price and offers a lot of hours of great entertainment and fun, especially if you have a friend to play it with. (With funny voices and comments of the units like "Let me axe you something!", "I wish I would have a hammer. Oh, I do!", "What am I? Cannon fodder?".\nUnfortunately the online part of the game is as good as dead, searching a game can last up to several hours...\n\nI hope this review helped you in making your decision about purchasing this game.\nIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS LEFT ABOUT THIS GAME FEEL FREE TO LEAVE A COMMENT AND I WILL TRY TO ANSWER IT AS GOOD AS I CAN!","March 29, 2015","true","5.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It was on sale for $4.99 and I decided I would give it a go. For the price I paid for it, I had a lot of fun playing (although not a lot of game time as yet). But this game will give me many more happy gaming time. The graphics is nicely done in a cartoon drawing style. During the cut scenes you need to read the dialog but then there is not that much to read. You get coins for completing the objectives and unlock weapons as you go along. You destroy castles (angry bird style) and built and defend your own castle. If you’re looking for a fun little game that does not need continues concentration, has humour (the background characters does all kinds of stuff) and that’s different from everyday games and a game that relaxes you then try this game. It supports multiplayer (so you may have fun with buddies) although I did not try it since I’m not into multiplayer.

Its half tower defense, half strategy/action. Very addicting right off the bat, the first time I turned booted it up I played 5 hours straight. You get a castle with a ballista that has different weapon types, which you can aim manually at the enemy soldiers and castle. You also have magic spells, a hero character, and an army which marches forward attacking whatever it comes across. The basic objective is to destroy the enemy castle or capture the enemies flag, however, the campaign offers a bit of variety apart from "destory this castle".\n\nAll in all, I would reccomend this game every time, especially if you can get it in a bundle or on sale! $10 is a great deal for this game and there is a lot of fun to be had. The art style is really quirky and reminds me of a fairy tale or a comic book. Actually, now that I think about it, the graphics are very reminescent of world of warcraft.\n\nThe only downside is that the characters don't speak very much dialogue, the majority of the story is text only, but don't let that sway you.","July 11, 2014","true","24.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nope. After the first couple of hours, you really want to give this a chance. because it's apparent a lot of love went into making it. Sorry, but there's no "aha" moment where the added subsystems like hero mode, spells and the castle editor bring anything good to the table. Then you realize you were just playing Angry Birds mixed with a crappy tower defense game and wishing you had your afternoon back.\n\nIf someone at Zen had had the courage to say after the art assets and world rendering was done, "Y'know, this game is kind of crap, let's hire a couple emo kids out of the corner coffee shop to write us an adventure game to go with it instead," it probably would have been a $20 game and a top seller.","August 3, 2014","false","10.0"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","0"

Castlestorm falls short as far as reinventing/creating within the genre.\n\nTroops seem to either be extremely OP or weak AF, there is little incentive to use most troops at a certain point.\n\nEverything revolves around getting kill streaks to get rapid fire to end the level.\n\nThere just feels like a very lacking element to this game, and I got bored of it and probably won't ever boot it again.\n\n\n","April 3, 2014","false","10.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It is not worth $10. The $5 I bought it for is about right. This game could have been great, but instead is merely mediocre, and all because of the poor unit mechanics.\nThe storyline is fun and engaging, but any actual control over your hero is close to imaginary.\nThe response time to shield against attacks is laughable, you can only see 3 feet in front of you, and you give up control over your best weapon (the ballista)\nGround based unit fights are done in an unusual style. each unit stops to fight only one other letting all other enemis past.\nFor example, if you have 2 soldiers against 1 enemy one of your soldiers and theirs will engage and your second will walk right past.\nThis might not seem like much until you get larger units with splash attacks. Trolls and the like can kill several of your units will one hit but only one of yours even gets to attack.\nThis combat is even more poorly implemented when you add in the ballista and flying units. The ballista shots damage your own units, and it can easily become impossible to fire without hitting your own units\nThe flying combat is even more disjointed and tacked on. I have never had a single ranged ground unit take out a flyer. You have to shoot them down yourself.\nCoupled with said flyers ducking and bobbing randomly, as well as dealing splash damage attacks (and one hit killing most units), this is a huge oversight and in many cases ruins and otherwise fun game time.\nThe organization of the game is foolishly repetative. In both kingdom/royal guard, and Viking/viking elites factions the units are almost interchangeable, but upgrades must be bought separately.\nSeparate upgrades must be bought for all of the support buildings as well, even though these are exactly the same across all classes. This is true of some of the Heros/Heroins too.\n\nToo long; Didn't read\nThis game could have been great, but the lack of testing and poorly implemented ideas make this mediocre. Only buy when half off (it's not worth the full $10).","August 17, 2014","false","19.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Overall, it feels pretty mediocre.\n\nFriendly fire.  Okay, just be careful, right?  Every time you do well, you get a kill streak, which makes your ballista (castle projectiles) shoot like an uzi.  Oh, and zooms out so you can see the whole battlefield. Just one problem with that: your mouse is then typically over top of your own army.  BOOM!  So glad I got that killstreak, I just killed my own guys because I did well?  Now I'm paranoid about getting kill streaks.\n\nRun around as a hero?  Sounds great.  Except the camera is too zoomed in, so you commit to a melee attack animation then get hit with enemy projectiles that you never had a chance to defend against.\n\nMechanics like these make it frustrating.  My brother and I bought it because we thought a co-op castle defense game would be fun, but little things like that at every turn spoils the experience.  We've played it for 10 minutes at a time and quit repeatedly.  We kept playing it thinking "surely it'll get better".

It comes across like a lego-style castle builder in the trailer, and while there is that element, most of your play time exists in the space between the two castles where you are waging war. The whole game feels a bit tedious. The storyline is forgettable, and nothing is really that fun. To be honest, I never came across a tutorial or even did much of the castle building in my whole time playing it. I must have gotten through half of the game, too.\n\nAnother thing that is hard to describe, but needs to be mentioned, is that this title doesn't feel very 'indie'.

The visuals are ok and there are lots of things to do, but you just battle another castle (hence the name) and other enemies through the use of a turret and your seemingly small army. You can also use a hero who is not that great. Now i know you should not expect much from a game like this, but it just feels slow and boring. You just get constant waves of enemies with no real challenge. This game is really fun at first and shows much promise with its apparant range of modes, but quickly becomes boring.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/upsilonforce/recommended/241410/","upsilonforce","Knight(300ping is love/life)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/upsilonforce/","128 products in account","Let me start by saying: I'm a total sucker for a good indie game. In my opinion, indie games are TRUE video gaming. None of this 50GB, HD, 1,000FPS, DX50, PERFECT GRAPHIX 'N SOOPUR AWSUM CINIMATICZ! The moment I saw CS for sale, I could of sworn it was a steal. I jumped into its wacky, colorful world that left my sides splitting with laughter and the time of my life in gameplay....but something went wrong about half way through; the game lost it's charm almost immediately by a few blantantly bad ideas and campaign design.\n\nPlot 10/10\n\nI love the idea of the story. 2 kingdoms in seemingly endless war were destroying one another. The goddess of the game's universe was so distrought, she cries, but - intead of tears - 2 gems were crystilized from her eyes and fell to earth. These strange metals seemed to sate the bloodlust of the 2 kings that held them and there was peace. However, someone has tampered with the gems, and war as again surfaced. Quite the creative setting, if you ask me. It has a few twists and is told well. Can't ask for much more out of a story in a simple game as this. You'll also be laughing thoughout at the zany writing and character design. It has a humor that is rarely tapped into nowadays.\n\nGraphics 10/10\n\nJust by looking at the screenshots, it's easy to tell this game is delightfully beautiful. With a wide palette of colors, Zen Studios truly made a charming world. The visuals remind me of an old Disney movie. Character models, level design, art; across the board, the visuals are at zenith.\n\nSound 10/10\n\nThe sound is up to par with the best of full budget, AAA titles. Voice cast is also well done. Most notably, the game's soundtrack is legendary! It's made by a young man that goes by the pseudonym WaterFlame89 on Youtube. Don't miss out on tracks like "Donkey Island", "Title Theme", "Happy War", "Storming Castles", or "Long, long ago..."! Remember old songs like the Goof Troop theme? They were so catchy, uplifting, and always made you smile; even during your toughest days. WaterFlame89 has ressurected that long, lost art of music composition. I almost cry when I hear them. ;~;\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGoYX1FMq-A&index=2&list=PL5xceeTDjuOPHBIQnD4TdpNljEggDFfsv\n\nGameplay 6/10\n\nMany will note the influences taken from Angry Birds ( or if you really want to go back, "Crush the Castle). This is a good example of "inspired" not "ripped off". You custom build your castle, or take presets to battle, adding rooms that each buff your viability. If a certain room is destroyed, it's contribution ceases i.e. if you have a barracks room destroyed, you can't train your grunts. There is a ballista that you can control to launch a variety of projectiles either at the enemy castle, or at the enemy troops. There's also an option to train troops of your own and smash the front gate of the castle; revealing their flag, or even spawning a hero that you control temporarily. Capture the enemies flag with your troops, or annihilate the castle to win. I was completely hooked by the gameplay and it's bronze/silver/gold ranking, challenge system. With great replayability, visuals, engrossing sound track, and humorous, intriguing story, what could possibly go wrong?\n\nCS gains momentum as you fire it up and play, but somewhere near the mid point of the game, it changes which faction you play as. The first mission of this new faction was dreadful! The game starts taking a bunch of cheap shots on you. You're forced to play a hero class and kill a certain number of enemies without dying. However, the controls as a hero in the first place are utterly terrible, clunky, counter-intuitive, and worst of all, you die fairly quickly. I had to change the game to EASY just to barely squeeze my way past this debacle. Worse yet, when you reach this point of the game, it's out of new features. You've already seen all the weapons, all the new troops, and all the new rooms. The rest of the game is playing the same mission against a fairly cheap AI whose troops 100% of the time STOMP on yours, forcing you to use your ballista on enemy troops while the enemy ballista takes free shots on your castle. Another annoying thing is your heros talk EVERYTIME they attack. One girl shouts "MAXIMUM DAMAGE" when you use her alternate attack, then shouts "Oh, no!" EVERYTIME she's hit. "MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO! MAXIMUM DAMA- OH NO!" Just from that quote, you can see how hero gameplay works; it's almost unplayable entirely.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nCS has a lot of incredible things going for it in terms of music, gameplay, sound, visuals, and story. The issue is that it runs out of fun before it runs out of content with bad level design and cheap AI in later missions. It was even enough to make me quit the game. I'm on the fence of whether I should recommend or not. Final score is 6/10. It's terrific!...until those few missions ruin it. Then Castle Storm becomes nothing but a slightly above-average game. It really pains me to talk about this game that way.","January 22, 2014","false","5.1"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","10","27","0","0"

Nobody wants to redo something like that.

I may have to have two separate save slots and leave the very first slot for the single campaign but it does not at all tell you this, ever. So I end up going back to the castle builder and it shows that the game forced my castle to be that way for the mission and if I want to have it how it was again for a mission that lets me use any troop, it's back to the castle builder for an hour. What a idiotic game breaking design flaw.

Watch a video of the gameplay and that's what you'll get.\n\nI'd say the first half of the game is a 9/10. Great fun, NICE boss battle, good stuff. Sadly, the second half is maybe 4/10 with glaring design issues. The second half also seems to be cut short, maybe due to deadlines? I'm also not pleased that the game ends without a proper conclusion and is pretty much a "BUY DLC TO CONTINUE STORY KTHX."

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stronzios/recommended/241410/","stronzios","stronzio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stronzios/","181 products in account","Bought this game on a sale without many expectations, because I'm not that much into the casual/puzzle genre and at first I was expecting some kind of lousy tablet port/angry bird clone. After doing some quick research, I decided to give it a try anyway, given the low price and the favorable reviews. Luckily my initial impressions were very very wrong!\n\nCastle storm is indeed a game mainly based on the usual and widely known "physics-driven destruction" formula of angry birds and similar games, but it expands that very concept and adds many other elements such as real time strategy, puzzles, management and... platforming,  all backed by a nice story. I must say that, suprisingly, all this stuff is glued so well that it works like a charm, giving CS its own unique personality.\n\nThe game flows smoothly, is never boring and the overall style is lovely and well designed, as are the characters.\n\nIn the end I was so hooked by this game that after I went through the main campaign I was a little sad because... well, it was over, and trust me when I say that I never expected that. It still took me a good 12 h to finish the main missions + DLCs, so I think it's more than ok on the lenght side. Don't forget there are also freeplay and multiplayer modes, but I never tried them (and I should do that as soon as I can).\n\n\nSo, what to say? Castle storm is a little gem, it's so much fun and and I highly reccomend it. It's worth the €9,99 price tag, it's even worthier on sale. Go for it!\n\n\n","January 4, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The mix of Tower Defense/Attack and Siege just seems to work in the way of Castle Storm.\n\nThere is a very frustrating Hard difficulty hero mission that I spent 2 hours on.... For that alone, I'm giving it -1 rating. It's just way too hard to do the mission on hard difficulty BEFORE completing the level on lower difficulty (which I didn't know until googling to see if people had similar experience). Trying to beat the hard difficulty with the original, unupgraded hero without spending hours coming up with the right strategy is almost impossible.\n\nThe end game lacks a bit. There is a survival mode but what if you don't have all the upgrades yet? Well, you are in for a 3 hour (or longer) farming session. It's a little frustrating because you need these upgrades in order to get over wave 25... the enemies just get so powerful that your units don't even matter by wave 20.\n\nMultiplayer Online is dead so you better hope to find someone to do the last 3 achievements with... the local co op is fun, but I wish It was playable in split screen instead of there being 2 screens (one on top right and one on bottom left).\n\nTakes about 20 hours to complete + possible endgame survival runs for extra hours.

You take control over one army and battle another one in a 2D Environment, Sending troops to do battle and supporting them with a full control siege crossbow.\n\nI had this game laying around for over a year I think before I started playing it. I regret not picking it up earlier. The main reason that drew me towards it, was it's graphic design. It has a colorful cartoony art style that reminds me of a more recent version of the Warcraft 3 engine while the gameplay feels a little like Orks must Die.\n\nAfter playing it first, it did not expect to like it. I usually don't dig tower defense games, as they bore me rather quickly. This one, I enjoyed however. The combat feels slick, theres lots of variety in both siege ammunition and troops and together with the DLC the campaigns are fairly long. When I stopped this game, it left me with a desire to want more. I was motivated to take on the campaign levels once again to get better ratings!\n\nOf course, this game is not perfect. You could argue theres too much focus on the crossbow combat, the multiplayer on the internet is practically non existent as of the date of writing of this review, the single player highscores are bloated with hackers and impossible to reach scores, the hero combat is a little simplistic and the castle builder mode is fairly hard to use.\n\nBut if you overlook this, you get a decent game thats a load of fun and I have to say it has by far the best vikings I've seen in over 10 years. Blew my mind. Also, the music was made by the artist Waterflame, who produced a big deal of tracks for Castle Crashers.\n\nI hereby recommend this game for a purchase. Pick it up when it's on sale.

Castle defence RPG ?\n\nYou can build your own castle, and how u build it determines what kind of units u can make, or what kind of perks you get as u fight.\n\nThe gameplay is basically you have a castle, and at the entrance u have a ballista that shoots various things(18 different things, 9 per tribe) you have 18 different spells to cast, and about 18 different units u can summon and you get gold to level all these things up. The objectives are usually to destroy the enemy castle, or capture their flag or something of that nature. Whats super cool is if a specific unit cause's problems, u can focus that part of their castle and it will stop them from devoloping them.","December 29, 2013","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many times trying to get the right angle to shoot the castle, you'll end up clicking the icon which drives you to your (or the enemy) castle, and I'm still trying to understand why that icon should be useful at all..\n\nand when you use the hero, those issues become just insane. it reacts so slowly that you'll be clickng and pushing and asking yourself why the hell is not doing it, at least 3 times before he will do the first thing you've pressed. and throwing weapons is so annoying that you'll probably give up if it wasn't that half of the mission has a bonus for the headshots (that the hero can make only with the bow or launch axes).\n\nand this drives to the conclusive issue. more than 3 quarters of the missions are made up to force you to DON'T play shooting the castle.\nyou'll have to shoot to the enemiy troops before they get money, shoot troops to cover your mates escape, shoot troops to make your troops occupy a mine, shoot troops because there is a freaking muntain blocking your view of the castle, etc..\nthen in some other mission you'll have to fight using only your hero for a reason or for another, or use another different hero for the sake of something else.\noh, but don't worry, you'll have many other mission in which you'll have to kill turkeys, or boars, or wolves, or whatever else.\n\nand the castles battles? I told you at the beginning. forget about them if you're going to play this game in single player.\nand if you play it in multyplayer, this will be basically only about shooting-shooting-shooting to the enemy castle, using mostly arrows while you wait other weapons span, and eventually arrowing troops as soon as they appear. All you have to hope is that the enemy is a noob and it's not shooting-shooting, or it has weak weapons, or its castle is badly structured and it will fall before yours.","March 7, 2014","false","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like Tower Wars, CastleStorm expands the basic tower defense formula by giving each opponent a citadel to defend and troops to send against the other.\n\nIn addition to sending troops, you can also fire various forms of ammunition, ballista/catapult style, against the opposing troops and their fortress.  By taking out sections of the fortress, you diminish the enemy's capabilities.  The physics involved are absolutely reminiscent of Angry Birds, and there's a great deal of satisfaction when you finally knock out that last section of wall and watch a huge tower come crashing down.\n\nThis game had a lot of elements I was looking for.  As of this review, I've played just four hours of the campaign (about 2/3 through), and haven't played around with the fortress design mechanics or anything -- they look good, though, as does multiplayer (assuming one can find an opponent).  The cutscenes are hokey in the extreme, but I'm not finding myself annoyed by them -- it's just a bit of popcorn to tie the missions together, and it works fine.\n\nDefinitely a good buy (especially on sale) for fans of tower defense, physics games, and artillery games (e.g. Scorched Earth, Worms, etc.).  Happy to see more games moving in this direction, moving past the basics of a single genre.  Probably the biggest downside for me is that the pacing tends to be a bit frantic, not leaving much room to contemplate one's strategy.","December 28, 2013","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Keep in mind that it's a side scroller but you and your enemy each have a castle and you have a hero, units, and a crossbow with various ammunition. There are several different units and heroes.

The game is lovingly wonderful (and isn't that just a bit sappy?)\n\n+ Strong gameplay, the game seamlessy combines spells, RTS and catapaulting together, the catapults vast array of weapons (from boulders, to conversion potions and homing exlpopding eagles) are bound to the left mouse button, the spells (summoning your hero for a direct control fight or summoning holy swords to implae your enemies) to the middle mouse button and your troops (catapult launching gluttons, pladins and donkey riders and more) to the right button, each form of combat featuring a hotkey and keyboard select system allowing for seamless combination of the trio)\n\n+ Destruction physics, speaks for itself really, nothing more satisfying then watching your ballista strike a javelin through your enemy or rocks smashing into the opponents castle and crumbling it away or even bouncing a battering ram sheep into the gate. It works great, and aside from the occasional glitched miss, its fluid, effective and satisfying, being the core part of the game it should be and certainly is.\n\n- Friendly Fire, I don't know who thought this was a good idea, so heres the situation, your troops are weakened by the oncoming plaadin, you fire your ballista straight for his head to give your troops a break, instead it gets sent smacking into your soldiers back and he dies, the enemies gain ground while you sent another squad to retake the ground you lost. Theres the problem, its almost impossible to use the troops and ballistae in tandem, they always get in the way of each other, there is no point using the infantry because despite the infantry being effective the ballistae is more effective and when your troops are LITERALLY BLOCKING shots for you're enemy, whats the point? putting in friendly fire just brickwalls the infantry and stops the fun, in a game like this, the realism of the firendly fire is all the more annoying.\n\n- Castle editor is pointless, don't get me wrong, its fun and all, putting your castle into action and creating an unstoppable design, but when the preset ones are already there, made by professionals, completely balanced, and tested for the most efficiency, theres no point in building your own where theres certain to be a gaping hole in your defense or not enough space for a troopers barracks etc. its the same problem as littlebigplanet, the created levels are fun but the ones made by proffessionals are almost certain to be better, less buggy and of a higher quality.\n\nOverview: despie its huge flaw of friendly fire, its good to remember it is the only serious flaw, and the editor is still there for those who want to tinker and the architects in us that could make great castles, so its more of a personal gripe but i think others would see the same thing, but that said its still a completely functuntional feature, so for its excellent features, great and realised ideas and wonderfully cheesy story, castlestorm gets a 9 out of 10, its only £7 and thats the price of most dlc for triple A games, which i guarantee you will probably won't be worth it, so give castlestorm a try, Its worth every penny\n\n","January 19, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Castle defence RPG ?\n\nYou can build your own castle, and how u build it determines what kind of units u can make, or what kind of perks you get as u fight.\n\nThe gameplay is basically you have a castle, and at the entrance u have a ballista that shoots various things(18 different things, 9 per tribe) you have 18 different spells to cast, and about 18 different units u can summon and you get gold to level all these things up. The objectives are usually to destroy the enemy castle, or capture their flag or something of that nature. Whats super cool is if a specific unit cause's problems, u can focus that part of their castle and it will stop them from devoloping them.","December 29, 2013","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is lovingly wonderful (and isn't that just a bit sappy?)\n\n+ Strong gameplay, the game seamlessy combines spells, RTS and catapaulting together, the catapults vast array of weapons (from boulders, to conversion potions and homing exlpopding eagles) are bound to the left mouse button, the spells (summoning your hero for a direct control fight or summoning holy swords to implae your enemies) to the middle mouse button and your troops (catapult launching gluttons, pladins and donkey riders and more) to the right button, each form of combat featuring a hotkey and keyboard select system allowing for seamless combination of the trio)\n\n+ Destruction physics, speaks for itself really, nothing more satisfying then watching your ballista strike a javelin through your enemy or rocks smashing into the opponents castle and crumbling it away or even bouncing a battering ram sheep into the gate. It works great, and aside from the occasional glitched miss, its fluid, effective and satisfying, being the core part of the game it should be and certainly is.\n\n- Friendly Fire, I don't know who thought this was a good idea, so heres the situation, your troops are weakened by the oncoming plaadin, you fire your ballista straight for his head to give your troops a break, instead it gets sent smacking into your soldiers back and he dies, the enemies gain ground while you sent another squad to retake the ground you lost. Theres the problem, its almost impossible to use the troops and ballistae in tandem, they always get in the way of each other, there is no point using the infantry because despite the infantry being effective the ballistae is more effective and when your troops are LITERALLY BLOCKING shots for you're enemy, whats the point? putting in friendly fire just brickwalls the infantry and stops the fun, in a game like this, the realism of the firendly fire is all the more annoying.\n\n- Castle editor is pointless, don't get me wrong, its fun and all, putting your castle into action and creating an unstoppable design, but when the preset ones are already there, made by professionals, completely balanced, and tested for the most efficiency, theres no point in building your own where theres certain to be a gaping hole in your defense or not enough space for a troopers barracks etc. its the same problem as littlebigplanet, the created levels are fun but the ones made by proffessionals are almost certain to be better, less buggy and of a higher quality.\n\nOverview: despie its huge flaw of friendly fire, its good to remember it is the only serious flaw, and the editor is still there for those who want to tinker and the architects in us that could make great castles, so its more of a personal gripe but i think others would see the same thing, but that said its still a completely functuntional feature, so for its excellent features, great and realised ideas and wonderfully cheesy story, castlestorm gets a 9 out of 10, its only £7 and thats the price of most dlc for triple A games, which i guarantee you will probably won't be worth it, so give castlestorm a try, Its worth every penny\n\n","January 19, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After that it starts to get a bit mononotous.  The developers did a fine job finding ways to avoid that with survival and castle editor, but it still falls a bit short.  The colors and graphics are bright and sharp, along the lines of Torchlight 2.\n\nGameplay is a good combination of strategy, building, and action.  A lot like Angry Birds, shoot until the tower falls, toss in different ammo for the level, and decide which troops you need to spawn.  Toss in a hero that takes you down to the action.\n\nMy biggest complaint, the controls are a bit mousey.  When you're the hero, it takes a bit for him to change direction, or start walking a different direction.\n\nPick it up on a sale, unless you're a fan of Angry Birds, then full price might work for you","January 19, 2014","true","43.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I expected this game to be a turd, but it's quite addictive. I just finished all of the single player content for this game (including DLCs), and it was a lot of fun. A lot of people are ragging on the story. I found it to be cute/funny. It's not serious at all and is quite ridiculous, in a good way. The style of comedy is similar to Swords & Soldiers if you've played that. In this game, you shoot hordes of enemies with a ballista, summon troops to attack the enemy castle and keep enemy troops away from your castle, all while blasting at the enemy's castle to destroy rooms which represent each combat bonus or enemy type the enemy has. Don't like their dragons? Shoot the dragon's nest off the top of the castle; problem solved! The castle-blasting is like Angry Birds, which I actually don't like, but I enjoyed the way it's done in this game. Oh, and you get money when you complete a level and can replay levels for more cash, upgrading everything from heroes you spawn and control zoomed in between the castles, the troops you spawn, your combat bonuses, etc.\n\nTL;DR Get the complete pack for this game with all its DLC whenever you see it on sale for just under seven bucks.

This is easily one of those games that will give you 20-30 hours of gameplay or more so at its normal price of $10 its worth it.  Also if you like the game i HIGHLY recommend you to buy the two expansions since Outcast takes place after the first two campaigns and Warrior Queen is the 4th campaign is helps tie up some of the story.\n\nOverall its a very well rounded game with good replay value although ive yet to try the multiplayer or the co-op.\n\n\n\n\nTwo big tips for those who want to get and play this game.....\n\nWhen you play the game make sure to go into castle editor and setup your castle before starting the next mission since they game doesn't inform you that the castle editor is a necessity to using new units and also the way to upgrade the castle walls/gate.\n\n\nIf a level is kicking your ♥♥♥ like the hero missions where you don't get to use your castle or units just beat it on casual and ignore the bonus requirement. Doing that you can unlock everything later and upgrade all the stuff after beating that campaign you can go back and replay that mission with fully upgraded abilities and units on harder difficulties.","January 10, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game can be surprisingly addictive and it can be challenging at times if you don't level up the right things before battle. You can plan out your entire castle, and how you build it can be very important. Do you build redundant rooms in case they destroy one? Where is the best place for your most prized rooms? Because if you lose certain room, you lose the benefit of their use, and unlike Command and Conquer style games, there is no way to rebuild any part of your castle during the battle. This changes how you strategize for battle, and puts a great importance on protecting the castle while attacking. And the combination of attacking with units and your own catapult weapon is pretty intriguing. There is a pretty good balance between these, you really cannot neglect your units or catapult weapons too much.\n\nIf I do have a complaint, it is that the game likes giving you a lot of levels that restrict you to just one task, like levels where you cannot use any soldiers, or "hero" levels that restrict you to just controlling your hero. The hero levels can be very hard later on if you fail to level that particular hero, it makes a huge difference. But while these hero levels can be a change of pace, the game is still at its best when the levels feature castle vs castle play.\n\nThe game is colorful, but still a bit gory if you are thinking about getting it for kids. The story is a total after thought, you are not playing this for any story. Even so, it can be mildly entertaining at times and is full of juvenile humor. The music is pretty good.\n\nOverall it is a pretty solid game.","June 26, 2014","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many times trying to get the right angle to shoot the castle, you'll end up clicking the icon which drives you to your (or the enemy) castle, and I'm still trying to understand why that icon should be useful at all..\n\nand when you use the hero, those issues become just insane. it reacts so slowly that you'll be clickng and pushing and asking yourself why the hell is not doing it, at least 3 times before he will do the first thing you've pressed. and throwing weapons is so annoying that you'll probably give up if it wasn't that half of the mission has a bonus for the headshots (that the hero can make only with the bow or launch axes).\n\nand this drives to the conclusive issue. more than 3 quarters of the missions are made up to force you to DON'T play shooting the castle.\nyou'll have to shoot to the enemiy troops before they get money, shoot troops to cover your mates escape, shoot troops to make your troops occupy a mine, shoot troops because there is a freaking muntain blocking your view of the castle, etc..\nthen in some other mission you'll have to fight using only your hero for a reason or for another, or use another different hero for the sake of something else.\noh, but don't worry, you'll have many other mission in which you'll have to kill turkeys, or boars, or wolves, or whatever else.\n\nand the castles battles? I told you at the beginning. forget about them if you're going to play this game in single player.\nand if you play it in multyplayer, this will be basically only about shooting-shooting-shooting to the enemy castle, using mostly arrows while you wait other weapons span, and eventually arrowing troops as soon as they appear. All you have to hope is that the enemy is a noob and it's not shooting-shooting, or it has weak weapons, or its castle is badly structured and it will fall before yours.","March 7, 2014","false","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The mix of Tower Defense/Attack and Siege just seems to work in the way of Castle Storm.\n\nThere is a very frustrating Hard difficulty hero mission that I spent 2 hours on.... For that alone, I'm giving it -1 rating. It's just way too hard to do the mission on hard difficulty BEFORE completing the level on lower difficulty (which I didn't know until googling to see if people had similar experience). Trying to beat the hard difficulty with the original, unupgraded hero without spending hours coming up with the right strategy is almost impossible.\n\nThe end game lacks a bit. There is a survival mode but what if you don't have all the upgrades yet? Well, you are in for a 3 hour (or longer) farming session. It's a little frustrating because you need these upgrades in order to get over wave 25... the enemies just get so powerful that your units don't even matter by wave 20.\n\nMultiplayer Online is dead so you better hope to find someone to do the last 3 achievements with... the local co op is fun, but I wish It was playable in split screen instead of there being 2 screens (one on top right and one on bottom left).\n\nTakes about 20 hours to complete + possible endgame survival runs for extra hours. I was afk for quite a bit of my playtime in case you are wondering.\n\nRating: 9/10","June 16, 2014","true","28.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After doing some quick research, I decided to give it a try anyway, given the low price and the favorable reviews. Luckily my initial impressions were very very wrong!\n\nCastle storm is indeed a game mainly based on the usual and widely known "physics-driven destruction" formula of angry birds and similar games, but it expands that very concept and adds many other elements such as real time strategy, puzzles, management and... platforming,  all backed by a nice story. I must say that, suprisingly, all this stuff is glued so well that it works like a charm, giving CS its own unique personality.\n\nThe game flows smoothly, is never boring and the overall style is lovely and well designed, as are the characters.\n\nIn the end I was so hooked by this game that after I went through the main campaign I was a little sad because... well, it was over, and trust me when I say that I never expected that. It still took me a good 12 h to finish the main missions + DLCs, so I think it's more than ok on the lenght side. Don't forget there are also freeplay and multiplayer modes, but I never tried them (and I should do that as soon as I can).\n\n\nSo, what to say? Castle storm is a little gem, it's so much fun and and I highly reccomend it. It's worth the €9,99 price tag, it's even worthier on sale. Go for it!\n\n\n","January 4, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mainly single player based, though it does have a multiplayer option which you can do on the same console/screen. You'll need a controller for player 2 though and he/she only gets to control the hero. Mostly a aim and fire turret game, when you do spawn in as the hero it's still so much fun and a break from the ballista.

Let’s get rocking.\n\nThe Good\n\nCastleStorm gives you a lot of options. You have a lot of projectiles to fire out of your ballista, you have a lot of troops to send marching toward the enemy keep, you have a lot of magic spells to both aid your troops and hinder your enemies, and you have a lot of rooms for your castle that give you different benefits. There’s a lot of wiggle room to play your way and it is great.\n\nThe campaign is long and there are plenty of side missions to keep you occupied as well. This game had more of a story than a few I’ve played recently.\n\nEnemy variety is as plentiful as it should be for a game of this nature. It’ll take a bit of work on your part to figure out what works on who or who works against who, but you’ll get there. And, once you know what you have to do to kill the enemy faster, the game only gets that much better.\n\nThe controls are very simple and user friendly. There’s no excuse to not have a handle on them by the second mission.\n\nThe Bad\n\nI’m trying to think of something I just outright disliked about CS or thought was poorly implemented, but nothing is coming to me. Let’s just move along.\n\nThe Meh\n\nCS has a lot of humorous dialogue. When the jokes are funny, they’re pretty funny. When the jokes are bad, they’re really bad. It’s almost like dad jokes; you either like them or you don’t.\n\nVerdict: Yea\n\nCastleStorm is a fun game, especially if you like games of this sort. If you see it on sale, pick it up. You can find it in the Steam Store, here. And remember, the Humble Bundle End of Summer Sale is still going until this coming Sunday, so keep your eyes peeled.

So if you're stuck because you're playing on hard since the beginning, you can switch to normal and then come back later to do it again on hard. Or you can farm previous levels. If you have that weird passion for farming, you should play this game. And yet, the game still offers a challenge if you want it to. This is a perfect example of how a casual game should be : You can finish the game easily on easy or you can 'beat' the game on hard.\nThe controls are pretty OK, you can play with only mouse or you can use keyboard+mouse.\nBuilding your own castle is quite nice too but what really adds to the game is the fact that you chose what you will fight with, like in any good RPG (this game is not actually an RPG).\n\nAbout the narratives :\nI was surprised to actually laugh at some of the jokes. It's all very childish but actually quite nice. The scenario kinda makes sense and even though it's really not complicated or especially deep, it very much fits with the rest of the game.\n\nAbout the graphics :\nLook at the screenshots. All the game is like that, even the cutscenes. It's quite ok and it also fits with the rest of the game. Besides the graphics are generally effective, mechanically speaking (who you gotta shoot and who you gotta not shoot).\n\nOverall :\nAgain, it's an excellent casual game. 11/10.","May 31, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like Tower Wars, CastleStorm expands the basic tower defense formula by giving each opponent a citadel to defend and troops to send against the other.\n\nIn addition to sending troops, you can also fire various forms of ammunition, ballista/catapult style, against the opposing troops and their fortress.  By taking out sections of the fortress, you diminish the enemy's capabilities.  The physics involved are absolutely reminiscent of Angry Birds, and there's a great deal of satisfaction when you finally knock out that last section of wall and watch a huge tower come crashing down.\n\nThis game had a lot of elements I was looking for.  As of this review, I've played just four hours of the campaign (about 2/3 through), and haven't played around with the fortress design mechanics or anything -- they look good, though, as does multiplayer (assuming one can find an opponent).  The cutscenes are hokey in the extreme, but I'm not finding myself annoyed by them -- it's just a bit of popcorn to tie the missions together, and it works fine.\n\nDefinitely a good buy (especially on sale) for fans of tower defense, physics games, and artillery games (e.g. Scorched Earth, Worms, etc.).  Happy to see more games moving in this direction, moving past the basics of a single genre.  Probably the biggest downside for me is that the pacing tends to be a bit frantic, not leaving much room to contemplate one's strategy.","December 28, 2013","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let’s get rocking.\n\nThe Good\n\nCastleStorm gives you a lot of options. You have a lot of projectiles to fire out of your ballista, you have a lot of troops to send marching toward the enemy keep, you have a lot of magic spells to both aid your troops and hinder your enemies, and you have a lot of rooms for your castle that give you different benefits. There’s a lot of wiggle room to play your way and it is great.\n\nThe campaign is long and there are plenty of side missions to keep you occupied as well. This game had more of a story than a few I’ve played recently.\n\nEnemy variety is as plentiful as it should be for a game of this nature. It’ll take a bit of work on your part to figure out what works on who or who works against who, but you’ll get there. And, once you know what you have to do to kill the enemy faster, the game only gets that much better.\n\nThe controls are very simple and user friendly. There’s no excuse to not have a handle on them by the second mission.\n\nThe Bad\n\nI’m trying to think of something I just outright disliked about CS or thought was poorly implemented, but nothing is coming to me. Let’s just move along.\n\nThe Meh\n\nCS has a lot of humorous dialogue. When the jokes are funny, they’re pretty funny. When the jokes are bad, they’re really bad. It’s almost like dad jokes; you either like them or you don’t.\n\nVerdict: Yea\n\nCastleStorm is a fun game, especially if you like games of this sort. If you see it on sale, pick it up. You can find it in the Steam Store, here. And remember, the Humble Bundle End of Summer Sale is still going until this coming Sunday, so keep your eyes peeled. As always, thanks for reading.","September 7, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
