The visuals beautiful and the soundtrack is fantastic to go along with it.\n\nThe gameplay is super smooth that's simple and easy to get grips with, and it's fun to play it. going from one solar system persay and orbiting machines at an extremely fast rate to destroy them. Jumping from on to another and controling your speed and momentum with boosts.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGFtjTmLXs8\n\nThere's a handfull of systems at the moment, but I'm guessing there's a lot more to come with more stuff to play around with lookin at those screenshots, and they look really nice.\n\nFor the asking price it's a solid product with the word "gorgeous" ozzing out of it. It has great gameplay mechanics to satisfy your play and mesmerizing visuals and soundtracks to satisfying your eyes and ears.","August 22, 2015","true","0.9"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","26","27","0","0"

A  simple concept and not very many levels.\n\nBut I am here to assure you, ORBITOR is not at all weighed down by these factors. This review is my personal opinion, and I am aware not everyone is into this genre of game.\n\nORBITOR is a powerful arcade title where you play as a small robot called an orbitor, and the objective is to obtain the warp core located at the center of each level. The warp core is inside a shell in the middle, and it is opened when all of the surrounding objects are destroyed. There is no story to this game, but like that of the Bejeweled franchise, one is not required or even neccesary.\n\nPROS:\n-Stunning visuals\n-Exhilerating soundtrack that never gets old\n-Awesome sound effects\n-Tons of features and abilities\n-Lots of replay value\n-Unique atmosphere for each level\n-Incredibly well optimized (you can run this game on integrated GPU's no problem)\n-Very addictive\n\nCONS:\n-Not very many levels (for now. As of right now there are 4, but it's been confirmed there will be more coming soon!)\n-Lack of settings in the menu (no graphical or audio adjustment and very loud default sound)\n-Some minor glitches\n-No real goals or leaderboards (including achievements and trading cards) so points feel worthless\n\nORBITOR is an excellent game, truly worth $14.99. Any of the cons I have listed are easily fixable, and they probably will be fixed soon. I reccommend this if you like a small game to play in spare time. 9/10.","August 22, 2015","true","9.4"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

I've played games for over about 40 years and this is one of those rare gems that I've encountered in my life. I'm amazed by the quality of this game. Superb visually, excellent music, very relaxing. I was so relaxed that I didn't even try to make points. I was just flying and looking at the visuals and listening to the music. I especially like the third level with a music similar to the style of Tron 2 and the beautiful background. Congratulations to the developer(s)!\n\nThe only things that I would say are somewhat negative is the low quantity of levels, the price and lack of information on what I have to do in the game. It starts without any help on what to do. But this is understandable as it is early access and not too complicated to get going. But I still hope for some tutorial or some information. As for the price, as the game stands, I would have preferred something like CAD$10. I know that more levels and gameplay elements will be added but EA buyers also bear part of the risk of not being completed. And we also give some publicity to the game. But that's my opinion.\n\nThe game lasts about 40 minutes but I could play for hours just relaxing flying. I'm looking forward to the next levels while I enjoy the 3rd level in the mean time.","August 23, 2015","true","2.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

(But it's Early Access so no complaints.)\n\nSince the demo was released this game has been on the radar of those who found it interesting. Even Markiplier, a Youtuber, was very impressed by this game back when it was first shown. After a few years of development it comes out swinging. Beautiful 2D artstyles combine to give you a depth that can rival 3D CG. Not to mention the music fits the areas down to a T.\n\nAt first it may seem a little difficult to understand the controls or know when to press what. But after a few tries you'll learn when and how to press the right buttons to gain the most out of the speed. The game becomes even more amazing once you nail this down and gains an unbeatable rhythm to the overall feel. Not to mention it feels extremely satisfying when you see yourself weaving and swerving from orbit to orbit while creating explosions in your path.\n\nThe only thing that can become frustrating is learning the right strategy for each level. How? Each level adds in a different element to take into account. So you have to fix your playstyle if you want to beat it. And dying can be the must enraging thing since you have to start all over again. But once you unlock that warp ability and see yourself dissapear like a beam of light, it's all worth it.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes! Absolutely. The levels already in the game may not be in the double digits, but they're super fun to play over and over again.","August 23, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARANimate/recommended/336220/","ARANimate","ARANimate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARANimate/","214 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAt first I wasn't sure what Orbitor was. Considering there wasn't a tutorial, I just thought it was a pretty space game where you just flew around and smashed into things. However, once I got the hang of the controls there was something to gripping about this game that I just got lost in it for awhile.\n\nSo far Orbitor has four levels to play, each just as beautiful as the last. They are each a combination of stars, gravity devices and gravity fields, all on top of an equally good looking backdrop. I can't express how great this game looks for an indie space title. The motion of everything, the ripple effects as you fly through the gravity field, and the light given off by the stars. It all combines for a jaw dropping aesthetic.\n\nYour character is a small little, I'm going to assume, spaceship, tasked with destroying gravity machines in the Quantum Nebula. You destroy the gravity machines by navigating your spaceship into the orbit of each device and as you go around it a red bar fills up, once full the device explodes. You did this from smallest to biggest, until you destroy the gravity device it self. Upon destroying the device it will release an atom, which when collected will activate your warp drive allowing you to go to the next level.\n\nNow that's just the goal of the game. Where this game truly shines is the controls. Which admittedly took me some time get the hang of. Once I did though, it made the game feel completely different to me. The main focus of the game is using momentum, orbit, gravity and your thrusters to score as many points as you can before moving on to the next level. There is a score counter at the top of the screen, which for now is just letting you know that you're collecting stars and destroying gravity devices, however, I can see in the future their being leaderboards.\n\nYou have access to two thrusters on your ship. One is a speed boost and the other is more of a directional thruster. Using these in combination with a ping (which shows the location of other stars and gravity devices) allows you to set up a multiplier with each continued move. Whether that be collecting another star, by flying through it or pulling to towards you, or destroying another gravity device.\n\nYou'll also have the ability to slow time and change direction while in the gravity field created by the large gravity devices. I didn't notice this at first, however, once I got the hang of it this is what changed the gameplay for me. By holding in the right trigger while in the gravity field you can navigate your ship towards other goals i.e. collecting more stars. It creates some unique tension as you are continuously building up speed as you build your multiplier.\n\nOverall, I think in it's current state Orbitor is worth checking out. With it's beautiful aesthetic, great controls, and inherent replayability.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hgGLV8dcJIE\n\nFor More Reviews and the Bi-Weekly Podcast\nEarly Access Media[www.earlyaccessmedia.com]\nYouTube\nPodcast[www.earlyaccesspodcast.com]","September 6, 2015","true","1.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

A concept that really stands out and deserves attention.\ni've played the online game and tested the warp demo and i can tell there's been progress. unfortenately, only the graphics are getting better, in my opinion, the gameplay has to be further developped to bring out the full potential we have here. the price is also too high for what it is right now, but i remain confident that the game will only get better from here.\n\nnow for the content itself, the swiftness and flow of your ship from a "bubble" to another makes you feel free like flying\n(yeah, seems cliché but is true) yet, while being limited in space to move in. the controls come naturally, but at first can be confusing.\n\nso its a great game!                                                                                                                                                   play it!","September 8, 2015","true","1.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"
