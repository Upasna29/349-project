With just 12 missions, it didn't take long to complete everything, including the optional bonuses.\n\nIt's very easy, but it also features some great pathfinding, partner and enemy AI for such a small project.\n\nThe low-key piano music is a bit odd at first, but helps create the slow pace that the game moves at. Despite being slow, it can also be frantic in a couple of the later levels, with Mission 8 being a particular stand-out for 'traditional' top-down arena shooting craziness.\n\nCould've done with controller support and quite a lot more content. Maybe an 'endless' arcade mode, or something. But what IS here is pretty good, all in all.","April 1, 2015","true","1.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","12","18","3","0"

Do you dare to dream about controlling a Sapphire mech?\n\nIf the answer is yes , sorry bruh all I can offer is a fun little twin stick shooter type of game with upgradeable mechs.\n\nYou can upgrade 3 parts of your mech - legs , body and guns. These parts have 3 categories , fast moving/shooting but lightly armored/low damage , medium , and slow moving/shooting but heavy armored /damege (which means you can basically turn your mech into a tank if you choose all heavy parts). Each type of legs gives you a special perk - the typical two legs give you a barrier that you can activate , sort of like a shield but it stays in place instead of moving with your mech exploding when its duration is up , the rat-track legs give you bullet time (which is nice sometimes as rat-tracks are hellaslow and bullets tend to be hellafast) not sure about the arachno legs as I never saw the need to use them or the medium body/weapon for that matter.\n\nThe game is a little on the short side , with only 12 missions , replay value is almost non existent , as the collectables are not that hard to find. That being said , I consider the asking price of 8 € too high (I got it as a gift) for a game that was once free to play browser game , as far as I know.","May 1, 2015","true","5.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The game mechanics are simple, the music is funky and relaxing, and you will blow lots of enemies into cubes.

The first 7 or so missions are a cake walk and then the difficulty ramps up a bit from then on.  The different bodies, legs and guns offer a nice balance but the first selection of each one seems to be the best.","April 3, 2015","true","1.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

I personally am not a fan of this genre but I hope to shed some light on this title as fans that are will enjoy this one and should give it a shot. It has nice visuals so it is a shame that its resoulution is low but you could say that it makes it even more old school. Interesting sound effects and music a bit repetitive but again just like an old school arcade game is. The gameplay is solid no problems there apart from the occasional invisible corner, the upgrade system broadens out the game a bit more and fits nicely adding customization to your experience. Like I said it is a good game for old school arcade fans or maybe at a push a sci-fi enthusiast but apart from that I highly doubt anyone else will enjoy it. So I do recommend it for those audiences.","April 16, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

Thankyou so much to the indian man that gave me this game for a bargain off ♥♥♥. Onto the game now, insane gameplay mechanics i really enjoy the fact that the missions are very very hard starting from the beginning. The upgrade menu is diverce and i really enjoy the fact that you can spend 5 attempts to complete the 4th mission and still fail!","April 17, 2015","true","0.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","4","8","4","0"

Jokes aside, the grahics are a wonderful example of more is less aethestic. Beautifully rendered 2D wire-frame models, almost x-ray like in their luminosity. Maybe a little too bright and opaque enough to get stuck behind from time-to-time.\n\nThe simple gameplay is enjoyable, though with controller support lacking you may want to use Controller Companion (look it up here on Steam) or similar to make the game controller friendly...if the devs don't eventually get around to that themselves. The ability to customise your Mech from the start was a wonderful change. Gimme a slow firing, can take anything you can throw at it and will throw twice as much back at you Mech any day.\n\nDown side? Game length and price. I was fortunate enough to score a copy in an IndieGala bundle so the price was a fraction of the listed price. For the length - 12 missions - 3-ish hours of gameplay (if you complete each mission in full before going on to the next and allowing for the odd case of 'OGM I'm surrounded...OMG what the I'm dead' moments) I'm not sure the full price ($9.99 I think) is worth it. Maybe with more levels it would certainly make the $/hr value better.\n\nOn special - go for it. Otherwise - have a think first.","July 11, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
