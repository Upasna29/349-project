I don't regret my purchase, but I will generally support any rts game, that I think has potential, and this game does have that.\n\nPros:\n1) A little bit of base building.\n2) A decent variety of units.\n3) Experienced based global abilities per game.\n4) Can pick your loadout( or what your able to build in game) out of/before game and save 3 different loadouts.\n5) Suprisingly for once, good scale.\n\nWhat it needs:\n1) Better environmental system of advantages and disadvantages. Height, cover, obstacles( firing lanes), and concealment.\n2) Repair system.\n3) Unit Vetrancy.\n4) More variety of same type of units. Both in the armory and what your able to build. You should be able to build a couple different kind tanks, with differnt versions of each kind.\n5) The armory needs at least 10x the selection for each unit. And it may need a point system in in of itself, to minimize exploitation, the cost of the unit in game might be enough to offset this, but I am not so sure.\n6) More structures and implacements.\n7) Bigger maps.\n8) A little bit more zoom out.\n\nCons:\n1) No campaign. For this type of game, its not really a con for me, but I know for a lot of people it is a deal breaker.\n2) A lack of everything I stated it needs. :)\n\nOverall its playable in its current state, and while I recomend the game, I do so only to those that understand what an early access/alpha/beta means and the kind of support and patience that indie/one person developers need. I will edit later accordingly.","October 25, 2015","true","1.2"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","38","39","0","2"

This could not be further from the truth. This game is in very early beta. It's potential is off the charts. It has many features that lend themselves to game changing strategy and tactics. For example if you take a neutral army controled area you might get a free tank that can change the momentum and initiative of the whole area.\n\nThe developer Windforce is also very active in the games forums and is very willing to work with the community to make Armor Clash the perfect blend of the developer's and player's vision of an adictive and fun RTS. I know this to be true because I bought the game played once, lost. I went to look for a game guide or manual and could not find one. I posted my desire for a guide/manual in the forums and within 1 hour Windforce got back to me and said yes he would write one that night!\n\nI was, as you can imagine, stunned. And Windforce delivered. Ever since that the game has become one of my favorites. I do not have a lot of time to play games because I have a large family to take care of but when I do Armor Clash is always on the "To Do" list ;)","October 26, 2015","true","3.4"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

This game is starting to gain ground and for me its already one of my favorites, the fact that it combines the most common and well known vehicles, and you may costumize your armory (the units you can use) its a great advantage. Really recommend this game and hope many people will support its got great potential.","November 17, 2015","true","3.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

This game will be a joy for you atleast for quite a while if you like RTS games. Now, if you have an average pc like me, then think before you buy it. Thats not saying dont buy it but you have to be a hardcore RTS fan to buy it especially since this game screams optimization (Yes i know this is early access). But as soon as more than 20 units get on the map, my pc goes down to around 15 frames where near the start it was running much better.\n\nThe AI. For the most part, its good, but the infantry AI sorely needs some retouches, as sometimes I'd find them running off in the distance or not attacking the target I pointed them towards.\n\nCombat looks great in the game, and it would be cool to see in the future how the customization thing turns out. Mixing and matching the different parts of vehicles would be amazing. Bigger maps would be appreciated as well as more zooming out. Great start, the potential for this game is OFF THE ♥♥♥♥ING CHARTS!","December 23, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's enjoyable and pays homage to old school RTS in my opinion, so i'd recommend this game to anyone whos loves RTS","November 14, 2015","true","2.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
