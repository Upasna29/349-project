I know this game is close to perfect except some glitches....... But me and my friend though of an idea. Why not make a 2 vs 2 battle? In that battle, the rows doubles increasing its difficulty. We also though to make some clans to let people team up in some "Clan Battles"? If you lfind this useful pls like!!","November 22, 2015","true","12.6"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","30","41","4","3"

The game is quite solid and a fun to play. What I'm worried about is how much is it 'Pay to Win'. I did not play against Online as I don't like losing haha. :)\n\nI really enjoyed the WW2 theme though and how the board is laid down. In the tutorial, I placed down so many tanks you would've thought my name was Patton.\n\nI would most definitely recommend it to most people who love strategy card games and are into WW2 themes. I hope this game turns out to be a fair fight of the brains without being too much pay to win when the game is fully released.\n\nI have attached my preview of this game as I find it's easier for me to video log things.\n\nThanks.\n","November 23, 2015","true","1.4"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","22","30","2","1"

I was very pleasantly surprised.  This is a game I could spend a good deal of time with.\n\nThe best comparison I can give is:  A mix of Hearthstone and Scrolls, with a military theme.

This game is an abomination of the original march of war.\n\nSure it has nearly as much units as march of war has, but this doesn't count to enjoy.\n\nWho wants to have a picture of a unit moving forward and backwards, when one can have an Army moving over an entire battlefield, wielding weapons and having abilities you're now using by laying a card?\n\nEven the grinding against ai and players seems to be joke in comparison to the original game.\n\nI don't recommend it and suggest demanding of the devs to get back to their roots!","March 5","false","2.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

It's better visually, at the cost of cpu and gpu power. good for everyone, though, because this connects to the same servers as the other versions, so it doesn't matter which you pick! you'll still be able to play the same game, with the same rules against the same people...IN HD.\n\nGreat game, generally fun. way better than hearthstone, and like scrolls with more unit interaction and battle. Hearthstone relies a lot on luck, whereas a bad hand in this game can win, if played right. the game is set up to allow for slow accumulation of cards, not a buch at once. rare cards are actually really rare.\n\nthere are a ton of cards, rivaling the first couple years of Magic the Gathering, and plenty of them have a lot of fun and interesting combos to use. As well, deck composistion does matter, so that's another thing to master and ♥♥♥♥ around with. I made an auto-advance deck, and it took bombs to take me down, or just destroying my troops 2-3 per turn. A good deal of fun, especially for a free game.

As soon as I watched the trailer I immediately started to download the game and praying not to be a fail free-to-play card game, like many other games of this type. And it didn't disappointed me.\n\nThe graphics are quite well developed and I like that the board looks exactly like a real battlefield. The cards are very interesting, as you can have different troops, tanks, special effect cards and so on. However, I have to say this game is very much based on the Domination Damage, so basically you don't need really high-stats minions on the board in order to win, just to figure out how to protect them in order to deal as much Domination Damage as possible.\n\n*Speaking of cards, I have to say that the packs prize is a bit too much for me, I mean in other card games you pay somewhere between 100-500 gold, but not 3000-4000. In my opinion, this thing should be change in order for this game to not become a pay2play game.\n\nDaily quests and rewards are pretty nice and it animates a bit the game.\n\nHowever, a big problem for this game is the FPS, which are awful during gameplay. I don't know if I reach more than 15 FPS per match.\n\nOverall, despite the FPS problem, this is a very funny and interesting card game and I truly recommend it to anyone. ^^","November 30, 2015","true","1.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

I have probably put over 600 hours in this game at least and I have no regrets. I plan to sink another 600 or more over the next year. The game is that good, especially if you enjoy games that require you to think and develop strategies to counter a large variety of deck builds and play styles.\n\nThe original version is completely compatible with this version as well (your characters, achievements, friend list, etc).  The only real difference is this XL version has a modified engine which offers a bunch of graphical enhancements. If you have a lower end PC you might want to download the  original version  instead.\n\nPros:\n\n*A variety of war themed factions, battlefields and units with virtually unlimited deck combinations and play styles.\n\n* The amount of in game combos you can perform are many. People are constantly discovering new clever combos too.\n\n*Highly competitive multiplayer experience.\n\n*Leagues, rankings, and ladders based on your skill level so everyone is on as equal terms as possible.\n\n*Arena mode with a fantastic reward system (this is by far my favorite game mode). Even if you don’t win a game you are still guaranteed a booster pack. The more you win the bigger the prize pool. You win gold cards, tickets, chests of gold, booster packs.  Every card in the game is open in to all players in Arena.\n\n*Crafting and disintegration system. If you get dupes of cards or you have cards that you don’t like, you can disintegrate them into tickets and then use those tickets to craft the cards you want.\n\n*Not P2W like a lot of F2P card games out there (every card is easily obtainable without spending any real money). Sure your can purchase packs with real money to reduce the time to unlock all the cards. However, all booster packs offer the same drop rarity whether you spend in game gold or real cash. Don’t worry if you don’t have the best cards unlocked when you first start playing because you will be placed in league with players that have similar cards and skill set to you. Also, you don’t even need the rare cards because there so many strategies you can use to win. The top Grand Master player currently doesn’t use any gold cards at all.\n\n*If you are a F2P gamer, the daily objectives (these can be completed via PVP or PVE) reward you with a nice amount of in game gold to purchase booster packs for your card collections or to use on Arena buy-ins. You are also rewarded with tickets and loose cards as your rank up or complete challenges.\n\n*Tons of achievements to unlock. Each of the achievements will reward gold when unlocked that you can use to buy booster packs.\n\n*Transparent and passionate development team that is constantly improving the game and interacting with community. Seriously, I have played a lot of games and this is one of the best development teams you will ever encounter here on steam. They are friendly and go out of their way to answer every concern you may have. The game literally gets better every time you load it up. That is how often they update it and improve it.\n\n* The community is just outstanding overall too. So many people on here that are willing and eager to help newcomers learn the mechanics of the game. I played literally thousands of games and never been insulted once. There are a lot of “older” gamers like myself in this community that always demonstrate sportsmanship during and after a game. Sportsmanship is a rarity in most online gaming communites today. This one has it though and it makes for a great experience.\n\n\nCons:\n*Game is still in development and you will encounter occasional bugs. However, the dev team quickly addresses them once brought to their attention.\n\n*Queue times will sometimes get slow because the community isn’t that large yet. However, it is growing daily. This is what I call a hidden gem of a game, but it won't be for long. Game is simply too good to stay "under the radar" for long.  I have probably 250 games in my library that I haven’t tipped since I discovered this game.\n\n\nIf you are highly competitve and enjoy games that require you to think then give this game a try.  There is a good chance you become addicted to this game though. It is easy enough for anyone to pick up and play, but difficult to master due to constantly evolving play styles and tactics.  Btw, you don’t need good reflexes to play or win at this game. This game is about outthinking and outmaneuvering your opponent on the battlefield.","November 18, 2015","true","1.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alxmurur/recommended/418110/","alxmurur","alexmurur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alxmurur/","","Early Access Review\n\nMoW Face Off XL is a huge leap in multiplayer strategy card games. Players take control of huge armies and super battle powers and must defeat the other in a ruthless one on one match up. Players can build decks carrying the most amazing fantasy armies from all over the world.\nThis game has a lot of content ready to be won and collected without any waiting time! Gone are the days where an upgrade makes you wait before you use it.\n\nFace Off XL has a rich multiplayer base and the Arena mode stands out in this regard. Players can choose 30 of the most powerful cards irrespective of their ladder position and play in their full skill capacity. Either win 12 games or lose 3, there is a guaranteed reward that helps one in the ladder PvP games.\n\nPvP feature is very efficient in matching up players and completely lets the player depend on the skill and not much on the cards that he or she owns. There is immense content in the game and one can never truly finish the game due to this. The Ladder system has leagues and each league lets players match up to their respective fair opponents.\n\nThe community reach is excellent with the developers themselves reaching out constantly to the gamers and trying to improve the game, as well as events to keep the players motivated. There are regular give aways and tournaments one can participate to win good amount of in game rewards.\n\nThe Products on sale in the store are very low priced and are extreme value. Especially the special card backs stand out as truly unique artworks. The store lets one purchase more cards and booster packs with in game gold and therefore the game rewards focus on the skills of the player and always get the player try harder to climb the positions.\n\nOverall, March of War Face Off XL and the series, is a great online game for anyone wanting to have great fun in a little time as well as someone who wants to build a brag tower of their skills, the game has something for everyone. The game is constatnly updated and new features and factons or cards are added and threfore the interest of a player is always kept on the edge. The game can also be taken anywhere on a Tab or a phone or even call friends to join steam and recruit them! Face Off is available on Steam, Android and Linux.\n\nGraphics - Unexpectedly great for a card strategy game. controlling the 3D units is too much fun and chess like.\nSound - The battle sound, the unit sound, the music, the sound that alerts you when a battle begins.. Just brilliant.\nContent - Out of this world. truly immense and has infinite potential. This game feels data well spent.\nMultiplayer - The community is excellent and one can find an opponent in a jiffy. Ladder system is very well executed.\n\nHighly recommended for everyone. A must try game.","November 20, 2015","true","96.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

I don't understand why some reviewers think it is a knock-off of hearthstone. Two big difference immediately pop to mind. 1) The game board play is unique and not in Hearthstone - this is a fundamenta difference. 2) I believe FaceOff is more challanging than Hearthstone. The devs claim there is no RNG except for the draw. I would say that FaceOff has better gameplay than Hearthstone, but that Hearthstone is way more polished and certainly has more lovingly nurtured graphics. Both games are very replayable, but I prefer FaceOff personally.","December 12, 2015","true","4.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Normally I don’t like strategy games as I am just no good at them, chess is my enemy! Yet on opening the game I found out its not this long hard thing but a card game! I love cards of all sorts and jumping into this game was very easy and its enjoyable as everything when I deaf the enemy and see their building crumble~\n\nI think this is one of the most put together early access games I have ever played. Smooth graphics, funny little quips on the cards~ ‘Join the army they said, it will be fun they said.’ Love that! Might not be fun for your little card army but I promise anyone who likes trying to smack down the baddies will like this one! It’s something I can see myself picking up rather than solitary before I go to bed and I can see a lot of potential that they can do when making new decks.\n\nI have only played it awhile and I have lost a few times but when I won I was jumping for joy and gloating. I will happily be recommending this game to my friends because it is something anyone can pick up and play even if they’re not good at it thanks to the difficulty setting.","December 15, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes, there is luck involved when it comes to what cards you draw, but in over 250 games played I found that skill mattered much more.

Before this bug it ran faultlessly,\n\nThe maximum play time between crashing is one battle and then it crashes at some point during the second battle.\n\nWhat have I tried to fix this new issue?\n\nI have re-installed the game several times,\nI have switched between M and XL versions,\nI have made regular entries through the contact support section found in the in-game menu\nand\nI have made daily requests for help via a thread I opened for the problem in the mods discussions section here on Steam.\n\nI have been requesting help from the Dev's on a daily basis for 22 days but I have not had a single reply from them, not even a suggestion or a we will look into it message.\n\nThis has left me with no choice but to give the game a negative review and no recommendation, Therefore I advise any prospective players not to spend money on the gems sold in game. You earn coins that can buy what the gems buy so with a bit of patience you can get what you want without spending any real money and this is the best way to do it,\n\nAs I have learned this bug can surface at any time so based on the fact that support is no longer reliable the smartest thing anyone can do is not waste money on it.","February 15","false","106.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The big stupid change from PG is there's only one type of damage in the game - the flavor text on one of the basic tank cards says something like "Yeah, its armor plating is great, but it's not impenetrable, so don't get cocky!" and what that effectively means in the game is that a bunch of recruits with only rifles can blow up a tank.\n\nAnd although most of the of units are "realistic" and are named after real WWII weapons, there are also many cards that have this weird fantasy or science fiction theme (such as man-eating plants or electro weapons). I'm not a historical purist, in fact I think I would enjoy the game more if it had a pulp storyline about "Oh no, the Nazis are training a dinosaur army, so I guess we'll have to use these cool mad scientist weapons and magic to beat the fuhrer's Teutonic T-Rexes!" but the scifi cards just feel shoehorned in, as if they're all from a really ill-conceived expansion.","November 20, 2015","false","3.1"," 17 of 42 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","17","42","0","4"

The quality is pretty darn good, especially for an early access game. The devs seems really involved, and that is a good sign. I get the feeling that many indies are really hurting financially, so when I see a game I enjoy playing, I really like to support it. It is really easy to diss a game, but many of these indie devs put thier heart and souls into thier games - and shoot from the hip non specific negative reviews don't really help the devs improve the game.\n\nSo here are my recommendations:\n\n1. FaceOFF has a vibrant community - but it really needs more players.\n\n2. The 3 factions need to be better balanced, and we need more factions.\n\n3. I am not sure how these guys make money - I play Arena and it is so fun, why wait for 10 min in the PvP qeue?\n\n4. The starter deck is so good - why build a custom deck?\n\n5. The game board is great idea and makes for interesting game play - but we need more game board features.\n\n6. The AI is really good, but it could be faster - I don't like waiting 3 minutes for the AI to make its moves.\n\nThats it - great game - intellectual but really fun if you like this type of game - almost addictive - but not yet.\n\nThis is a thinkers game, not a twitchers game.\n\nI hope the devs continue to evolve face off - this game has the right dna - it just needs polish.\n","December 23, 2015","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But since it's an early access, I think this game needs a LOT of work. The main problem is, I think, the theme: It is good not to see another rpg card game free to play but something fresh, not exploited but I find the game simple and with repeated mechanics. I have to say too, and I have readed it before in the comments too  before writting is that this game reminds me a lot from hearthstone, not in the gameplay but another features like the arena or the way the cards show up when you open a package. It might seem stupid to complain about such simple things, but, I prefer to play Hearthstone (even when I don't really like it) over this game if they don't innovate on their own game if we see it like this. As an indie game i hope they introduce new features and continue developping it because it is the only way, the hard way.","December 28, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers are clearly responsive to the reviews, well at least one of them, although not that recently. The last time I played it against my friend, we had a blast! This game truly involves strategic gameplay when it comes to using different strategies, like when I was playing with my friend, he would have like a large army of germans attempting to rush my lines when I had tanks and mechanics pocket medicing them. xD Im getting back into the game now,  getting a new friend to try the game out, and I can't wait till the soviets arrive. (Dem Germans won't see it coming) This game does have balancing issues but Im sure they're already sorted out. I recomend this game to anyone who is into strategy games and card games. Also, as a response to some negative reviews I saw, this game has little reemblence to Hearthstone in my eyes. It has different in a lot of ways, from the idea of movment and conquer damager system. I rate this game 10/10. Would like to see that story campaign you're promising! :D","February 3","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now servers are down so this is unplayable!!\n\nIf you like board games, II WW action, card collecting, competitive matches where anything can happen, good AI and dedicated dev team, this game is for you. Not to forget it's free and in this case it means you can actually enjoy the game without paying a dime, until you feel it's job well done and buy some gems to pay for the hard work all those people put in for your enjoyment.\n\nI won't be getting into details of what the games has etc. as others wrote it and there is no risk attached for anyone to try it. My fav part is Arena, where you get to play with all the best cards out there and if you are lucky and good enough might get to 12 wins and earn a gold card and other prizes.\n\nAre there any negatives? Yes there are still few bugs spoiling the fun from time to time, but rest assured Devs are working hard to clear them. There is always someone on chat and reporting issues is pretty straight forward within the game engine.","December 16, 2015","false","269.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
