Not sure how someone didn't think of this sooner.  Rather then playing humans with ak47s you now have a choice of animals, such as ducks, bears and turtles. While still provided with a standard array of weapons the real fun comes from adding some crazy items into the mix, including pelican turrets and rabbit bombs.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2AbMnUs7XI\nGameplay consists of clearing waves while huddled around the ammo pile. Stalks fly through at random intervals dropping boxes containg weapons, items and health packs. Every 5-10waves you are faced with a boss fight which didn't involve much more then outputting more damage, would like to see extra attack moves and such added in future. Currently the game contains 6 characters, 2 maps, 3 game modes and 3 difficulties. Alternate modes included penguin and kitten rescues, where you are tasked with taking groups of animals from A -> B.\n\nDid feel it was a little on the easy side, even on higher difficulty settings but I do play quite a few twinstick shooters. Would love to see online co-op added in future as for the now the game supports local co-op only. Can't say I had a chance to test it but would like to think enemies numbers scaled depending on players connected, supports upto 8!. Both Gamepad and keyboard+mouse were responsive but unable to be remapped. Devs have plans to add a bunch of weapons, enemies, levels and further tweak damage output. Solid base to work from, keen to see where it goes.\n\nIf looking for a stylish twinstick shooter that's a little outside the box, Nature's Zombie Apocalypse just might fit the bill. Would make a wonderful couch co-op game but probably a little short lived if intending on just playing solo (with the current content). Cheers folks. :)","July 23, 2015","true","1.1"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","22","29","3","0"

I now wish that we did not pick up the free keys because I would love to support the devs. One idea could be to have trading cards so that whenever we buy cards, backgrounds, booster packs we still support the devs :D\n\nThis game is a fun shooter, so much fun and the bosses are hard but not too hard. Great if you have friends round or siblings, singleplayer is also just as fun though!\n\nI really do reccomend this game though. It's incredibly fun but as with all early access games it can be improved and I'm sure that when it gets fully released it will be so much better but as the game stands right now it is worth buying now. You can play singleplayer or local co-op only at the time of writing this review but I hope to have it so people in our friends list can join on another computer!\n\nI'll update this review as the game gets updated :)","December 16, 2015","true","7.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This concept had sold it to me.\nRunning around as an Elephant with a mini gun on Tower Bridge - I can honestly not think of anything funnier.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PQyCwn-_1AA\n\nThis game harks back to a time before the internet was a key element of multiplayer gaming. A time when you'd round up your friends and gather around the same television set for some co-op hilarity.\nThe game has a charming look to it which adds a level of humour when coupled with the exceptional level of blood sprayed around the screen as you tear through wave after wave of rather clever zombie.\nThe two currently playable maps - Street & Tower Bridge as large enough to enable you to run around setting traps, or plot your escape should the worst case happen, whilst portraying wonderful elements of London in a cute style - dusty black cabs and parked up busses for example. Two more levels are on the horizon, with Trafalgar Square and what looks to be a train station / yard.\nThe vast, vast array of weapons unlockable will ensure you return to this game time and time again.\nThree modes of play are offered over three levels of difficulty.\nYou also have a large array of items to dress your chosen character in, from aviator snglasses to RoboCops headwear.\n\nIf you want a mindless, blood-filled, manic, co-op game where you get to play as a SAMURAI BRANDISHING SLOTH or a SHOTGUN TOTING GORILLA then grab this badboy now!\n\nOh, did I mention - FLAMINGO TURRET GUNS!","July 24, 2015","true","0.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","0"

There's a great selection of guns, even special tools like turrets, and even "Ultra moves" for each animal character. It's certainly not going to be a mainstay of your gaming for a long binge, but it's great to have if you have a SteamOS computer, four controllers, and friends looking for some fun that's easy to pick up.","January 30","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Rob Saxton, one of the developers, responded to my emails and informed me about future updates. Can't wait! I was not told to write a review but I'm doing it anyways.\n\nDisclaimer 2: This review was written during early access.\n\nStory/Premise: 92 out of 100 Penguins.\nWith so many zombie games out there, it makes you wonder... What about the animals? Do they get infected, or is this virus only for humans? In Nature's Zombie Apacolypse, you play as the animals after the entire human population was infected by a zombie virus. You have to fend off the zombies with guns as lots of different animals.\n\nMenu: 85 out of 100 Penguins.\nYou know you're in for a ride when you hear that awesome but edgy-sounding music with a ton of infected humans roaming around. You can quicky change the controls, options, or view the credits.\n\nCharacters: 77 out of 100 Penguins.\nThere are currently 9 playable characters. That's how many TF2 has. The characters are almost all the same with the exception of stats. Speed, strength, and agility. The stats are confusing because there is no clear explanation on what they change in the gameplay. It's also kind of unrealilistic. For instance, the turtle is one of the fastest animals. And the gorilla is one of the weakest in terms of strength. He actually flexes when you hover over him. Also, it's not very well balanced. The sloth has really low stats while the turtle has high stats. Otherwise it's completely fine. Each character also has a rage move which takes out the enemies quickly. I like the shrew character.\n\nControls: 71 out of 100 Penguins.\nKeyboard controls are slightly better than garbage. Play with a controller if you have one. For some reason, when using WASD, the W and D keys work but not the A and S. Arrow keys are fine though. It does show you the controls everywhere (loading screen, pause screen, options) which is nice, but it's a lot to take in for beginners.\n\nGraphics/Art: 96 out of 100 Penguins.\nThe art style is amazing. It's a great mix of futuristic, urban, and a pinch of cartoony. The animation is stunnig to look at, the environment is beautiful (for an apocalypse setting) and small things like splash screens and props make the game more visually appealing than a lot of other unity games. Too bloody? Turn off blood in the settings for a more family friendly visual.\n\nMusic: 83 out of 100 Penguins.\nThe menu music is so good. It fits the theme very well. Each map has a different tune, but none of them are as good as the menu one.\n\nSFX: 70 out of 100 Penguins.\nIt's just sound. Not too repetitive, but not ear porn.\n\nUnlocking/Progress: 91 out of 100 Penguins.\nI'd like to see some steam achievements included to make me feel better about doing stupid things. Otherwise, the reason I find this game so fun is the leveling up system. Every time you level up you get a star. You need to have a certain number of stars to unlock weapons, hats, bombs, and little terrorist snails. You also get coins that can be used to buy those unlocked items. Unlocking maps and gamemodes is a bit different. You need to do something specific in order to get the next map/gamemode. To get Kitten Rescue, you have to save 45 penguins in Penguin Protect. Don't like unlocking things? Want to try out weapons, maps, and gamemodes that you don't have? Try the quick play feature, where you can play the game with everything unlocked.\n\nWeapons: 88 out of 100 Penguins.\nI was actually suprised by the amount of weapons in this version of Early Access. There are simple weapons like the pistol and the sword. But there are some pretty crazy weapons, too. From a freeze ray, to a flamethower, to a chainsaw, and even a gun that squirts out deadly bees. If you want a weapon that you don't have unlocked, there are ? crates that contain random weapons.\n\nHats: 89 out of 100 Penguins.\nHats have always made a game 10 times better for me. Team Fortress 2, Platform Racing 3, Duck Game, and now this. There's only 8 hats so far, but they're not just cosmetic. Each hat gives you a small modifier like more damage, defence, speed, exp, and coins. They also look badass, I mean look at that tiara!\n\nArtificial Intelligence: 93 out of 100 Penguins.\nThe zombies come of from the ground and are pretty good at killing you. Like I said earlier in this review, the Penguin's pathfinding is my favorite part of the game. They trip over things and waddle around, it's really cute! The bosses are questionable in terms of difficulty. Some bosses I'm able to kill in a matter of seconds with certain weaons. Other bosses completely knock me out to let their minions nibble on my fur.\n\nPrice: 100 out of 100 Penguins.\nThis game is worth it for what it costs. A fair price.\n\nGameplay Elements: 90 out of 100 Penguins.\n\nPros\n-Ammo is valuable and well balanced.\n-Sensitivity is not changeable. (yes this is a good thing)\n-Not too big of a difficulty spike.\n-You can jump but you don't really ever need to.\n-Local leaderboard and MVP for multiplayer.\n-Revival system.\n\nCons\n-Can't shoot through dead bodies or props.\n-Bosses knock you out for a scary amount of time.\n-Cannot be revived if fell in water, making you useless for the rest of the game.\n\nMutiplayer: Unknown number of Penguins.\nI didn't get much time to play local because most of my friends live in a different state and they only visited for a weekend. But I had a lot of fun in that short amount of time. I'll be able to play with them soon because online multiplayer is a planned feature. It sounds great but I have no idea yet, we'll see.\n\nSummaryOverall: 9.75\nArt/Sound: 9\nGameplay: 9.25\nFun: 9.5\nPrice: 10\nFuture Outlook: 8.75","February 7","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Played it two player with my brother using our Xbox one remotes. We liked the choice of characters and weapons avaliable, still got a lot to unlock. It's cool having the choice to play as all the characters but it would be funner if you got to unlock them and earnt new special moves with button combinations as you progressed as i think it would be more addittive.

The key things for me are:\n\n- Customisable load out and hats\n- Responsive controls\n- Different modes (Survival, Penguin Protector and Kitten Rescue) keep gameplay varied and fun\n- Consistent graphic style\n\nAs per other reviews, initially I was finding the gameplay a little on the easy side, but as soon as I got to higher waves, the Zombies became faster and harder to outrun and the bosses became tougher to defeat. I really like how you have to keep your player on the move and restock ammo.\n\nOne of my favourite elements are the different rage abilities, my favourite is the duck who creates a tornado and wreaks havoc on all the zombies. Here's an example of said ability: http://www.gfycat.com/WindyGrimArabianoryx\n\nReally looking forward to the devs unlocking more levels and challenge modes, this is the sort of game that will benefit from challenges and will increase the game's re-playability.\n\nOverall, awesome work and looking forward to more content!","July 26, 2015","true","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"
