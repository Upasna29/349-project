Designed for up to 4 players. Solo play is possible, but slower paced I felt, as I went through the game solo. Game was a bit short, and you end up revisiting some levels. Character animations are good, and the level system is okay. Leaderboards might have its fair share of cheaters, but maybe a purge of sorts could be implemented.\n\nexploration thoughout the game is okay. i have yet to find all of the collectables to get the best weapons, and was able to join 2 games that were in progress online. Not for players expecting a wide range of enemies or deep story - it's all about collecting and killing for leaderboard supremacy.\n\na very cool pick up game that supports the XBOX controller that shouldn't be missed.","November 25, 2013","true","11.5"," 48 of 56 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","48","56","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/233190/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Depending on how your teenage years were, a highschool reunion can be an exciting time to catch up with classmates you haven’t seen in years, or a nightmarish experience having to reassociate with people you’d rather not. Regardless, the event would likely be made universally terrible if upon arrival you were greated by a murderous swarm of mutants out for your blood, and a citywide infection that has turned citizens into zombie like abominations. This is Final Exam, a coop focused non-linear brawler with a lot of personality, though not the gameplay chops to make it a classic.\n\nChoosing between one of four characters, which surprisingly all play rather unique, you’re dropped into a level and given a handful of objectives to complete. What’s unique about FE compared to a lot of brawlers is stages are structured like giant rooms instead of linear paths, allowing you to backtrack through areas again searching out collectibles and finding secret passageways that cause everything to connect. This is one of the coolest things about the game, but it’s also one of its biggest weaknesses. Because of the inherent way levels are designed, you’re often forced to do an abundance of incredibly tedious backtracking from one side of the map to the other, which becomes especially obnoxious from the endlessly spawning enemies slowing you down. It’s not as bad in coop as one player can go to each area on the map, but considering you’ll often need more than one person by you just to stay alive while fighting it doesn’t completely fix the issue, and creates a new one.\n\nThe objectives also pose their own issues, largely from the fact they repeat themselves almost exactly in each and every level. Go meet someone, fetch some items for them, escort them to a new area, protect them while they do something as slowly as possible, and rinse and repeat until the level ends and you get to do it again in a new area. Except when you don’t, as ontop of recycling objectives FE repeats the same environments for about half of its brief 8 missions (which should take you about 3 hours to complete your first time through)..\n\nThe fighting mechanics continue this trend of monotonous repetition, consisting of merely a single melee attack, a firearm, grenades, and special moves unique to your character. Aside from a handful of different ways you can use the single melee attack to hit enemies in various directions, this is a button mashing affair through and through. It’s enjoyable enough for what it is, but when you are fighting hundreds of enemies per level, with minimal variation to the types of said enemies, it loses its appeal rather quickly as you are continually forced into extended fights which seem to drag on for infinitum.\n\nI have to take issue again with the progression system, namely how character upgrade points and weapons are distributed. The former is split into two groups: skill points and character points. Skill points are earned by getting high scores in levels, similar to earning XP in most games just tied to a leaderboard. Character points on the other hand require you to scour through levels for collectibles, or else be stuck with the same base stats the entire game. This is great as a means of making collectibles mean something, but bad for allowing the player to grow as most will likely miss the majority of these on their way through. Another issue is that all weapons have to be found within levels before you can select them, but even after doing this the weapon is only unlocked for whichever character you picked it up with. This basically means you’re required to playthrough the game multiple times if you want to swap characters, which is frustrating and really corners you into sticking with whoever you selected at the start.\n\nOne aspect I enjoyed quite a bit was the art design, which makes up for its lack of polygons with a ton of personality and cool character designs. Zombies have been done a thousand different ways, but there is something about the semi-cartoony way they are portrayed in FE that makes them stand out. The few human characters in the game are quirky charicatures and rather entertaining to watch beat the snot out of mutants. The story is as outrageous as you could hope, though it makes all of zero sense in coop as the story cutscenes at the start of mission are all removed, leaving you to wonder what the heck you’re doing.\n\nFinal Exam does a lot wrong in the way of injecting variety into a genre so often devoid of it, even in its best games, but it’s not so hopeless as to be wholly written off. As a brawler it’s repetitive and pretty shallow, but when played with friends can still be pretty entertaining (if surprisingly brief). As a solo affair I couldn’t recommend it, so check your friends before heading to this reunion; you’re gonna need them.","June 8, 2014","true","4.0"," 47 of 58 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","47","58","2","0"

Repeat them over and over again.\n\nThere are 8 stages (supposedly), but really there are only 3. You've got a subway, school and amusement park. Play the Subway level for 2 stages. Then do the amusement park for 2 and then the school 2, back to the amusement park and then back to the school again. It was really sloppy and lazy.\n\nThe hordes/packs of enemies that you're required to fight come far too often. This wouldn't be a problem if not for every other room in the game having endless waves that keep respawning.\n\nThe artifical length of the game doesn't end with the the same levels and enemies repeating either. Oh, no. You're also forced to backtrack the same level numerous times to get objective pickups for fat npcs. I don't know why they're all fat, but they are. And after collecting these random items for numerous overweight people you then have to escort them.\n\nThis game has everyones favorite game features; backtracking, escort missions and infinite enemy spawns.\n\nGet the game if it's $2.50 or less and you really, really like doing the same thing over and over.

Or shoot one down with a gun? Or say f_uck it and chop one up with a chainsaw? Well you can do it with Final Exam.\n\nYou play as one of four best friends visiting their old high school. There they get trapped in an old town infested by monsters, monsters, and more monsters. This is a 2.5D game that uses combos as its main hook. It’s a lot of fun to throw a monster in the air, jump after him, and bash him to the ground. Oh, by the way, there’s monsters. Did I mention that yet? The AI for the enemies is good, but seems fairly easy if you know what you’re doing regarding gameplay and combos. The combat is fluid and visceral as well as exciting. The game’s not all melee combat. You do have a small arsenal of firearms that are a joy to use. In addition to the melee weapons and firearms, there’s also grenades that feel like a bit of a cheat, but are fun to use nonetheless. The locals for the game are well designed and offer a wide variety play styles.\nOne thing you need to know before you buy this game is that it’s centered around co-op. The singleplayer is fine, but multiplayer is where I had most of my fun. Whether locally or online, cooperative play adds a lot to the beat-em-up aspect of the gameplay. Taking on the horde of monsters with a friend is very rewarding. Each player has a tag above their head so you can recognize them among the confusion.\n\nFinal Exam is a clever action-packed game that is riddled with horror game staples and campy goodness in equal measures. With specialized characters and art to dazzle your eyes, there's something in here for any type of gamer.","March 7","true","8.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Very shallow even though you can upgrade your different attributes and gain character-specific abilities. The levels are larger areas with many nooks and crannies to explore which leads to finding new weapons (close range and long range). There are 4 characters to choose from although the most difference comes from the special abilities which aren't that special. (added flame damage, electrical damage etc.)\n\nLocal coop is nice but I'd recommend online coop because the camera only follows player 1 and there will be parts where dividing up will result in unmanagable chaos and/or backtracking. There are different kinds of enemies but generally all you do in the levels is the same no matter how diverse they feel: Kill loads of monsters, help an NPC with something or protect them and also item hunts.\n\nI'd say buy this in a sale and go in with very low expectations. The combat isn't deep and it all boils down to button mashing and building up massive combos. If you want to play single player, just forget this game it'll get boring really fast. Coop though is another story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/233190/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Final Exam is a spin-off from the ObsCure series of horror games, which there were two of for the PC, PS2, and Wii. Those games were Resident Evil clones set in a school setting and with heavy teen horror cliches. All characters were stereotypical, stupid, and various cliches of teen horror movies showed up in the game, and many teens died. The game had to do with a type of plant over growing and spreading something strange around... The game was also notable for being an old-school styled horror game with co-op, though no online.\n\nWell, the studio that made ObsCure games parent company was going down the shutter, the team disbanded from them, and then used their own money to buy the ObsCure IP back from them. They worked on a handheld spin-off, known for a while as Project Obscure, but changed the name to Final Exam so fans wouldn't throw a fit the game was too different from the ObsCure series, being a 2D Brawler and all of that. It's still set in the ObsCure universe though, just a lot more cartoony.\n\nFinal Exam is a 2.5D Beat-Em-Up with a focus on 4-player co-op, and the studios first title as their new group. Also their first online title. The game is best described like a mixture of Devil May Cry meets Shoot Many Robots, as the combat has a surprising amount of depth to it, mixed with chipping enemies health away with guns, coming in and performing combos or stuns, dodging attacks, juggling enemies in the air, etc. you get a combo going, that is times and resets when hit. The game can get addicting to keep a combo going, especially as points are tied in to rankings, unlockables, and leaderboard, as well as experience. At any time, you can press a button to cash-in your combo and get the points from your current combo, which also resets the combo. But better than getting hit and losing it all, right? Or maybe you want to risk it and go higher...\n\nExperience helps learn more combos and abilities, and as the course of the game continues, you get a good variety of guns, melee weapons, and grenades to use, which all feel pretty different.\n\nThe stages have a fun open-world style, with multiple objectives to do. You can, as a team, work with your friends to go location to location to complete objectives, or separate to complete different ones apart. Occassionally the game will throw some change of pace to keep things interesting. Objectives are sort of typical; go here and beat enemies, pick up these items and delver them to this point, push a kart and hold enemies off, escort a character, etc. Stages also have thing to discover by exploring, including new weapons, and extra skill points to increase character stats hidden around to collect.\n\nThere's not really a strong story to it. There is some small story, even some extremely brief cutscenes, but no dialogue, and feel kind of like a missed opportunity as the game as a quirky comic-feel, and could be fun with some story humor. The presentation is nice though, and the music is fitting.\n\nThe game has the flaw of re-using areas, though. They have different objectives and have changes to them, but in the games 8 stages, there are four locations, and you go to two of the locations three times. There is also only two bosses in the game, and one of them just keeps getting stronger and adding new moves over the course of the game. Enemies are varied though, and usually multiple types of a single enemy, all who get introduced well over the course of the game.\n\nI would say if you want a beat-em-up with friends, and don't mind a bit of tedium (maybe best played in spurts rather than all at once), to give it a shake. It has flaws, but also some charm with it, and the combat is well-done.","March 10, 2014","true","14.8"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","17","22","2","0"

Sadly, the gameplay is lacking in terms of variety and scope, and is highly repetitive after killing so many enemies. There are moments where the game offers some change in how enemies are killed, but these are far and few between.  However, all negatives aside, for the asking price of under £7, you can't really go wrong, and with the game offering  good visuals, and some fairly robust  gameplay, Final Exam does come recommended.\n\nScore - 7.5/10 - Review by Robert Cram","November 26, 2013","true","13.0"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

I think I got this as part of a bundle. It was like 30 cents or something. I'm not really the side scrolling brawler/beat'em/shoot'em up type of guy. They're okay as games, but they don't peak my interest. Final Exam is different!\n\nIt has an easy learning curve despite the types of combo's you can do. It's a 4 player coop game with multiple characters you can select and level up via a skill tree of some sort.\n\nIt's not linear. You can go left, right, up or down. Every player has their own screen. And "sometimes" the objectives are randomly placed. Which is a good thing. Because you don't want the game to be boring with minor objectives (like collecting stuff), but you don't want to be frustrated with major objectives, like the rhythm of taking down a boss or escorting an NPC.\n\nThe best part of this game, is it manages to surprise you with something new or different in each level. I can't explain it all, but I'll tell of two examples:\n\n1) In the first level you have to push some kind of train-car. But you must jump on top of it whenever the floor becomes electric or whatever. And at the same time, there are enemies popping up here and there like normal.\n\n2) Somehow they managed to squish in a space-invaders-like gameplay, followed by a Super R-Type kind of gameplay. And yes, we're still talking about a brawler/beat'em/shoot'em up here!\n\nThose are only two from the top of my head, there were several! Felt like about 2-3 unique variations of the gameplay per map.\n\nMusic is good and atmoshphere is excellent!

A slick looking online multiplayer supported smash ‘em up to make the tried and true transition from Xbox Live and Playstation Network onto Valve’s Steam.\n\nSo four characters that look like they should be featured in a ‘where are they now?’ of The Breakfast Club are on their way to a High School Alumni Party. The Jocky Football guy, artsy chick, nerdy boy, and token minority (not sure which, but his skin is darker than the others) happen to be adequately trained with martial arts, explosives, and the use of several types of firearms. Since this is not a game about awkward realization that everyone else in high school has moved on with their lives and become adults instead of trying to relive their glory days into their late 20′s their car runs into a hoard of monsters, you grab a pistol and baseball bat with nails driven into it, and start a swinging.\n\nEach character specializes on a few key skills, Jock is the big melee bruiser, nerd is the tank / explosives expert, Artsy chick is good with firearms and melee, while token guy is good at guns and explosives. Gameplay is smooth and well polished. If you’ve played any 2d style smash ‘em up since River City Ransom you know how this all works (even down to enemies dropping food, ammo, and grenades for some reason when they die). Go from objective to objective smashing things as you go. It’s certainly done well with beautiful polished levels sporting impressive backdrops along the way. If anything the levels are TOO well detailed as some areas can have quite a bit of clutter in the background but overall the game does a great job of offering you plenty of eye candy and a never ending stream of monsters to smash.\n\nAs you progress through the game you earn skill points to unlock special moves and such as well as character points to add to your character’s abilities. Basically it improves damage dealt and how much hp you have. It’s an interesting RPG element designed specifically to add longevity to a rather simple and straight forward smashing game. While it certainly is nice to make your character more powerful and makes you want to scour every level for every collectable and weapon to get all the unlocks, the abilities are actually counter-productive to their longevity cause. See with all the new weapons you find and new abilities and stats you get your character becomes too badass and frankly the combat starts to get too repetitive and dull.\n\nThe game is broken up into several missions at the end of which you are rewarded for how well you completed it. More points means more skill points. I think though the missions are just a bit too long as some of them really start to wear on me and often times I was just hoping it would hurry up and end. Also the objectives in each mission are pretty much typical copy and paste stuff that feels rather dull and uninspired. After having to fetch crap (be it gas cans, weapons, machine parts, lab assistants, or children) every single mission you get rather tired of it after a while. And while the game has a pretty cool and perhaps a little edgy (and chuckle worthy) style the story is just so inanely pointless I have no investment in it or the characters to care enough to keep playing.\n\nI was ready to praise Final Exam, for the first few hours I played it was fun, fast, furious, and a fresh break from the usual slow paced games I play. Online was likewise even more fun and a great fast paced romp with random strangers. But after the sixth mission I just hit a wall and suddenly I didn’t care anymore. I’ve killed a thousands of these dang monsters, only have a faint idea why and really don’t care if I save the day or not. Just about every mute NPC that I’ve come across in my journey who helped me ended up dying in some kinda humorous way (usually squashed by a mini-boss) and I was just tired of the game.\n\nThis game made me seriously consider just how long should a game keep me entertained? Obviously it should do so at least from beginning to end, which sadly Final Exam fails for me. But even if it did keep you satisfied to the end you might replay the game again just to get all the unlocks. But then what? Once you’ve filled out all the skill and ability trees there’s really little to do unless you’re the kind of person who wants to get their name up on a high score list. This is clearly a throw-away game at best that you play through once or twice maybe with a couple friends and then forget it ever existed. It’s almost sad really, as the developers did a great job of making a crisp clean and pretty fighting game. But repetitive boring mission objectives that have been used a million times in MMO grinds (go here, collect, bring back. Go here, escort, bring back. Go here, kill, kill, kill, kill, keep killing, and kill some more.) ruined an excellent fighting game. Combined with a completely uninteresting generic carbon copy story that gives me absolutely no connection or reason to keep going and we have a game that really falls up short.\n\nIf you like smash’em up games I might suggest giving it a try but don’t expect anything life changing.\nFinal Score:\nGraphics: 8.5/10\nGame Play: 7/10\nMusic / Ambiance: 9/10\nStory: 1/10\nValue: 5/10\nOverall: 6.1/10\n\nRead more reviews on my blog!\nhttp://markofithian.com/","November 26, 2013","false","3.9"," 38 of 69 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","38","69","0","0"

I got gud quick and learned to spend more time focusing on evasion.  Regardless of adapting to the speed of the game however, it doesn't matter because enemies just don't take much damage at all.  Every attack feels like I was using a wiffle bat and b.b. gun.  These enemies are sponges that take ridiculously long to kill, even on easier settings.\n\nThe biggest problem though, is the repitition.  The attack animations aren't fun.  In fact, they feel grossly disconnected and boring.  *swing left, swing right* wash, rinse, repeat.  And you do this all through endless swarms of enemies through seemingly endless levels.  There's nothing fun about any of it.\n\nThe level design itself is nice though.  The graphics are crisp, it runs nicely, and it's pretty.  But the overall gameplay is just so drab and monotonous that I have no desire to even want to see how it opens up.","February 11","false","0.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Beat up some monsters, pick up the bulky key item you just dropped and move another ten seconds or so in the direction of your objective before being forced to drop said item yet AGAIN to beat up some MORE monsters!  I mean, I know it's a "beat-'em-up", but cooooome oooooon!!  Things can be a little less relentless/tedious than that.  It also has an inordinately large number of "escort" missions, some of which are admittedly very amusing - carrying a candy dispenser to get the fat kid to follow you, or scaring another kid in the direction you want them to go by wearing a giant rabbit head and going "boogie woogie"! - but having to constantly make sure they're keeping up with you, when the game is already a race against time to make it that extra ten feet before you have to stop/drop everything for another decidedly "same-ish" battle DOES get a little tiresome.  Having said that, the escort missions are perhaps the things which give this game much of its "character", as without them, it really is just running around pummelling or shooting things.  Bit of a catch-22 somewhere there, one suspects...\n\nLook, the graphics are lovely, the sound is fine (even if the groovy/spooky music gets a tad repetitious, like everything else), and the gameplay is fun enough in small doses (a notion not exactly helped by the fact that you can't save in the middle of a "chapter", and have to see the whole thing through in one sitting unless you feel like starting from scratch again next time).  I found myself quite unable, in any case, to play for much more than an hour or so at a time, as it really does get a tad "old" kinda fast.  Mainly only recommended for the die-hard beat-'em-up crowd...for the rest of us, we'll probably "get the idea" within the first couple of hours of gameplay, and be sufficiently satisfied by that.  I know I was...and that's probably why I'm giving up about half-way through the game (which I may not have done, granted, if I were able to jump into it for only twenty minutes at a time, but the aforementioned save system nixes all that...in all other regards, however, this is the very definition of "casual" gaming).\n\nOne thing I will say in the game's defense is that it really IS meant to be a multiplayer game, so I perhaps partly have myself to blame for playing it solo.  Just the same, a bit more variety wouldn't have hurt either the single OR multi-player mode (heck, even reducing the endless amounts of "back-tracking" may have done wonders)!  Recommended, yes, but only for the right kind of people, in the right kind of numbers.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.\n\n(PS  Oddly enough, this game has vague tie-ins with the Obscure series of survival horror games.  If for no reason other than it being from the same developers/publishers, and featuring the same high school and some of the same characters.  And that's about where the similarities end.  It's a strange world, sometimes...)","November 12, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Mostly, one "Always on" skill and some special moves, and the damage they deal with specific weapons. It's more fun with friends, but so is anything up to and including getting slaughtered by an ax-wielding maniac. Even the weapons are pretty samey, but it's fairly straightforward to start whacking enemies and never get touched, stringing S combos together in no time.\n\nNot much in the way of story here, generic characters go to town on zombies because zombies are in the way of generic characters, eventually they run into token savior scientist. (Named Adam, no less! Only Heinrich beats that for cliche points!) Should mention that much like Corey from Obscure 2 was a Derrick Whitley expy from Sum 41, Sean is Jarle Bernhoft from Span, which is pretty cool. Although he's browner, for some reason.\n\nMusic holds up, although you might wanna pop the youtube repeat on. Horde music is always the same.\n\nOverall, the first five levels hold pretty well, but here's the thing: It's an 8 level game with 4 effective levels, AND it's padded over that. Once per episode, your characters must stop beating people up to do something completely unrelated! Hey, let's toss boxes at this guy while we chase a train! Let's ride flyers and hit other flyers while we're at it! Let's play space invaders! Why? Cause... Those games were 2D too...? The minigames come out of left field and most of them do NOT fit well. When it's not minigames, it's lugging stuff around. Apparently Leafmore has a booming business in demolition. You can tell from all the nitro boxes laying around unsupervised.\n\nAs mentioned, you get new levels on 1, 2, 3 and 5, and the rest is repeated. You will surely be familiar with splashy world by the end of this game, tell you that much. It doesn't work against itself as much as you'd think: Being able to get a grasp on the levels quickly means you can blaze through them while racking up your combo the next time you're there, which you'll probably want to do.\n\nYou know when Obscure 1 pulled a bait at the end, and it was awesome? When you've just beaten the final boss, your character injects the vaccine, and then, in broad daylight, the final boss comes creeping back up to try and fight you until the very end? That underlined his human nature and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation he was in, a man who had lost what very little he had left? Obscure 2 tried to do that, and... It brought back that one puzzle from 1. Hey, even then, my thoughts were "Hey, more game, cool." Final Exam tries to do that, with a cool minigame, followed by an okay boss, followed by another boss, followed by ANOTHER boss, followed by YET ANOTHER GOD DAMN BOSS ARE YOU KIDDING ME followed by EVEN ANOTHER BOSS ARE YOU EVEN oh it was a bait cool then.\n\nSo yeah, it keeps the Obscure formula, if a little mislead at times, it still makes for a fun game, and the best selling point would be that it's pretty cheap. Don't expect any of that caustic humor or videogame references they promise, though. Caustic humor never gets past "Fat guy dies ridiculously" and videogame references can be summed up as "Gordon Freeman had a crowbar, the cake is a lie."\n\nDespite my tendency to underline the negative, I'd say grab it if it's in a sale. Or even if it's not and you like beat 'em ups. On it's own, it's a good game, and I'd say actually being tied to obscure, specially obscure 1, hurts it by comparison.","January 18, 2015","true","57.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The graphics, while definitely leaving room for some improvement, are still good and the controls are great. The game is pretty fun and I would give it higher than a 66, probably a 75 or so. I have heard that the game is a bit short which sucks. Every level up to this point (I've played 3 so far) has been very long, around 45 minutes each, so I can only assume that there must not be but a very few levels in the game.\n\nThe only other real problem I found with the game is that there are not any giant stacks of cocaine bricks in the levels that you can smash open with your bat and dive into face first so hard that it would put Scarface to shame. It would also be great if the enemies you get to murder weren't monsters and instead were the bratty screaming little kids that are always at the supermarket. If I could get away with it I would murder them in droves.\n\n75/100","October 11, 2014","true","2.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

So i know a good game on eyesight.\nSeries i've played : DnD arcade, Cadilacs and Dinos, Captain commando, Steet of rage, Double Dragon, Battletoads, Final fight, Dynasty warriors, Samurai warriors, Devil kings, Fighting Force, Gaiapolis, Lightbringer, Night slashers, and so many i cannot remmeber all of them. So lets start with it already.\n\n-The controls on this game are awfully hard to master. They are way too unconventional. Even after getting used to it, it won't feel right.\n-Every stage is the same boss, but greenier.\n-Only 1 monster: A green alien thing. Then a green flying alien thing. Then a green crawling alien thing. So on.\n-Inifinite monster spawn on your face, making your progress throught the game very slow, as you are constantly fighting something.\n-Goofy animations. Feels like  a cartoon or something like that.\n-Special atks aren't satisfying as they should be.\n-Granades are the best way to win any fight.\n-All the weapons are the same: Some do slightly higher damage with lower stk spd, some with high stk spd but lower damage, overall they kill an enemy in the same amount of time. So what is the point in that ? Maybe just aethetics for players to choose a shotgun or a rifle.\n-Objetives in this game make you feel like a delivery-boy, not a apocalypse zombie/alien thing.\n-The game has very stupid mini-games that are unskippable.\n-Some specs are very underpowered. Like a certain character deals more damage in AoE with 1 bar than 4 bars on single target.\n-You can afk highscore. Just leave some weight on your controller or keyboard and kill infinite monsters till you reach your desired score.\n-Doesn't feel like other beat'em ups that you always want to punch something.

It would have been great to have known that from the beginning! :(\n\nWe spent a lot of time exploring the entire map...getting all collectibles and so on...and actually had A LOT of fun! The game in it's core is not bad! We actually really liked it!\n\nThe thing is, this kind of mechanism is not really a friendly one :)\n\nWhen you launch the game it actually tells you that it has an auto-save function....we didnt even suspect that our endevours though the subway would be simply wiped at the event of our death :(\n\nI have purchased a 4 pack...We will give the game another go of course...but this is not a very nice welcome :)\nPerhaps it's saving checkpoints only on easy mode? No idea...I'll have to check that...\n\nEither way, I don't know how to rate the game...on the one hand, we really liked and enjoyed it...on the other hand, this deadly-wipey surprise kind of left us with a bad taste in our mouths. (Hence why I'm feeling like typing this)\n\nWe're a couple that loves videos games...and always looking for new, good co-op oriented ones...\nIt's a bit of a shame that such a "mechanic" was put in place :s\nPerhaps it should have been more as en option that you can toggle on / off...Or at the very least presented and informed in some way - Let us know what the risks and mechanics are!\n\nFor the time being, I'll not recommend purchasing unless you have no problem with having your entire progress wiped at the event of your death.\n\njust to be clear: THE GAME IS GOOD! I recommend playing it! It's indeed really fun! Just keep in mind that it's a bit brutal in that regard...Perhaps this is why it's called Final Exam ;)\n\nAnyway, I'll update this after the next time we'll play :)\n\nTill then, have a great time folks ^^","October 12, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 18 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","2","18","0","2"

I was hoping for a boss at the end of every level. It was disappointing to find out that all of the boss, except the final boss, were variations of the tank NPC, which began spawning regularly at later levels. A lot of the unique events are fun, including a parade float mounted with a rocket launcher, two miniguns, and flamethrowers. The combat system was unique but easy to learn. There are different types of attacks to use, but there are no combos besides the standard "click left mouse three times" combo. You put your own combos together, which I like a lot.

Completing your standard "go here and flick a switch" or "go here a grab an item" type objectives, all while trying to pump your combo meter as high as you possible can in order to achieve the best score possible.\n\nWhile the concept sounds pretty boring and uninspired, the execution is surprisingly well done in what I can only describe as a sleeper title.\n\nThe graphics are actually pretty nice, the sound, not too bad.  The music kicks in at certain times and has a decent amount of energy to it to keep it relevant to the action on screen.\n\nA rudimentary skill system is present, as well as passive/active abilities to enhance your beat-em up style game play.\nLots of options for high-hitting combos, air juggles, charge-up attacks, throws, explosives, and ranged gunplay.\n\nSkill and ability points are awarded based on your performance, as well as upon mission completion and on your ability to locate and track down 7 hidden objects throughout the maps.\n\nCharacter selection boils down to 4 cliche types, the melee specialist, explosive experts, gun master, and a jack-of-all trades/master of none.  The character you choose affects the allocation of your starting skill points, and I believe, although am not positive, you get a different skill tree based on your selected character's expertise.  It's a nice touch, but it seems like the majority of your attacks are going to be melee based, so an explosives expert really seems to be the odd man out in terms of usefulness.\n\nThe level design is simple, yet large enough to keep you engaged.  It does lack a mini-map, and due to the repetiveness of some of the levels, it can be a bit difficult to keep track of where you have been at times.  I will say that one glaringly obvious flaw is that the levels simply do not have enough monsters/enemies.  You will find yourself running around from one end to the other of a decent sized map, encountering very little in the way of resistance, making some tasks really kind of boring and banal.\n\nControls are decent, allowing you to use mouse/keyboard or a controller...  Normally I am a mouse+kb kind of guy, but I think this game would benefit more from a controller given the type of gameplay that is encouraged.\n\nI have yet to try out the multiplayer, but I think if you managed to coerce a buddy into joining you, whether online or locally, many a good times could be had.\n\nAll in all, I would give this game a solid 7.5/10, as it does has some charm.\n\nWorth checking out if you want a little bit of nostalgic gameplay.\n\nTLDR\n\nPros\n-nice graphics, especially the animations, for a side scroller arcade-ish game\n-soundtrack flows with the action\n-combat/combo system\n-multiplayer\n-gameplay and control works excellent\n\nCons\n-story (what story?)\n-level design - lacking in enemies\n-cliche character classes\n-cinematics","April 20, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Completing your standard "go here and flick a switch" or "go here a grab an item" type objectives, all while trying to pump your combo meter as high as you possible can in order to achieve the best score possible.\n\nWhile the concept sounds pretty boring and uninspired, the execution is surprisingly well done in what I can only describe as a sleeper title.\n\nThe graphics are actually pretty nice, the sound, not too bad.  The music kicks in at certain times and has a decent amount of energy to it to keep it relevant to the action on screen.\n\nA rudimentary skill system is present, as well as passive/active abilities to enhance your beat-em up style game play.\nLots of options for high-hitting combos, air juggles, charge-up attacks, throws, explosives, and ranged gunplay.\n\nSkill and ability points are awarded based on your performance, as well as upon mission completion and on your ability to locate and track down 7 hidden objects throughout the maps.\n\nCharacter selection boils down to 4 cliche types, the melee specialist, explosive experts, gun master, and a jack-of-all trades/master of none.  The character you choose affects the allocation of your starting skill points, and I believe, although am not positive, you get a different skill tree based on your selected character's expertise.  It's a nice touch, but it seems like the majority of your attacks are going to be melee based, so an explosives expert really seems to be the odd man out in terms of usefulness.\n\nThe level design is simple, yet large enough to keep you engaged.  It does lack a mini-map, and due to the repetiveness of some of the levels, it can be a bit difficult to keep track of where you have been at times.  I will say that one glaringly obvious flaw is that the levels simply do not have enough monsters/enemies.  You will find yourself running around from one end to the other of a decent sized map, encountering very little in the way of resistance, making some tasks really kind of boring and banal.\n\nControls are decent, allowing you to use mouse/keyboard or a controller...  Normally I am a mouse+kb kind of guy, but I think this game would benefit more from a controller given the type of gameplay that is encouraged.\n\nI have yet to try out the multiplayer, but I think if you managed to coerce a buddy into joining you, whether online or locally, many a good times could be had.\n\nAll in all, I would give this game a solid 7.5/10, as it does has some charm.\n\nWorth checking out if you want a little bit of nostalgic gameplay.\n\nTLDR\n\nPros\n-nice graphics, especially the animations, for a side scroller arcade-ish game\n-soundtrack flows with the action\n-combat/combo system\n-multiplayer\n-gameplay and control works excellent\n\nCons\n-story (what story?)\n-level design - lacking in enemies\n-cliche character classes\n-cinematics","April 20, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really hope they make some DLC or a second game. I've only played a couple of hours but very impressed.\n\nFinal Exam combines retro style beat em up style game play with good graphics and modern gameplay stuff such as character levels, skills points and coop team work. Think Streets of Rage/Double Dragon meets Left for Dead or Killing Floor.\n\nI guess to sum it up "Sidescroller Left For Dead" would nail it!\n\nBasically you and your friends play through a platformer game and a story with 10 levels currently. It all sounds simple but there's lots of nice twists along the way it's not just hack and slash, game play is diverse enough that each level is different from the last and it keeps you interested. Each level you will have objectives to complete whilst smashing monsters and leveling up. You get a certain number of lives but can be revived by friends, you'll need to work together to make sure items are shared out properly and you have the right specced characters to complete the game. The game play is pretty quick and you need to watch carefully for changes in levels as new things like background objects, re spawning monsters or level secrets keep you busy there's not much standing around admiring the well designed graphics. The bosses I've encountered are defiantly a nice challenge the first time you fight them.\n\nAnyway....level objectives consist of finding objectives, escorting an NPC, moving something from A to B and occasionally surviving a horde it's pretty simple but very fun. You will encounter new missions and plenty of variety as  you go through the game, there's some nice game play features which are clearly borrowed from games like Sonic The Hedgehog, Battle Toads, Golden Axe and many of classic console titles.\n\nThere are many different attacks, skills and enough character customization to make this repayable on harder difficulties. Max health is your friend!!!!!!!!\n\nThe characters and controls are pretty standard to platform players and you'll quickly recognise character wise one is ranged, one is tanky and one is melee with a jack of all trades, however you can assign skill points and items however you want.\n\nThe tutorial is nice and simple and teaches you the basics, the combos and monsters are fun and the art style, sounds and graphics are all pretty cool and this game is stable, solid and well thought out. There's some nice humour in this game but I'd imagine single player it wouldn't be as good so I'd recommend picking up with at least 1 other person, I'm playing 3 player which is just enough it's not to chaotic.\n\nIf you want a cheap coop game with 5-10 hours game play with friends go for it. Oh and there's full controller support if you have USB pad but it's fine on keyboard and mouse. Just make sure you like beat em up/platformer games first.\n\nWE NEED DLC/NEW LEVELS OR A 2ND GAME!","September 8, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
