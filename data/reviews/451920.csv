"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/451920/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5483 products in account","My favorite genre of game, the rpg, I remember fondly my first rpg, the amazing Final Fantasy 7, Cloud and his merry band of terrorist (yes they were terrorist, but back when the game first released terrorist meant something totally different than it does today)  I still recall being amazed, the graphics, the sounds, the mini games, I couldn't play the game enough, I put well over 100 hours into FF7, and that was my first save.. other amazing games the suikoden series, who could forget Breath of Fire 3, even Shadow Madness (called one of the first American RPG's by Game informer....  whatever that meant)  So what do Final Fantasy 7  and these other amazing games have to do with Throne - Death Merchants.. not a single thing, except they are both members of my favorite genre and they are all amazing games..\n\nWell then, shall we move on with my review of Thorne - Death Merchants?  Aside from the main character being named Crow, and the name of the fort, nothing else was related to Game of Thrones, so I removed this section\n\nThe Story\n\nThe story starts you off as Crow, a man shackled in a keeps dungeon.  He's bloody and retelling the tale of a murder!!!  Did Crow commit the murder, was he framed?  Did the butcher, the baker or the candlestick maker frame him???  That is what we'll get to see first hand as you relive the story that Crow tells to his jailer.  I'll expand upon the story as I move through the game...\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nThe game play is different from many of the other rpgmaker games out there..  it's made using real-time combat as opposed to turn based combat.  I certainly don't mind the real-time combat, It felt out of place for a game using this type of engine, although I did quickly adapt to it, and quickly grew accustomed to it.  After nearly an hour of game play I have to say real-time combat had me more immersed in the game, it felt more interactive, rather than just snoozing through battles pressing the attack button, I was more apt to pay attention during combat, and the combat had an air of difficulty other games made with the same engine don't have.\n\nAll the normal rpg options are there, items, equipment, quest, status, the game had an added selection called encyclopedia, this section gives you a brief description of the enemies and NPC's' you're met throughout the game.  (handy addition and helps with immersion).  Another difference between Thorne and other games, is armor, you don't equip armor in the game, instead you equip accessories, which increase your stats, you can equip 4 different accessories.  Another really useful option is the auto loot, no more toiling away checking every barrel/crate/pot/bookshelf.  The items are automatically looted by using sprint, can make finding all the hidden items fairly simplistic.\n\nA few tips to keep in mind...   if the game starts in a tiny window, use alt + enter to bring the game into full screen mode.\n\nSome useful default button's if you're a controller user (xbox 360 wired)  You can remap the buttons but these are the default selections\nY is the attack button,\nA is the run button\nB brings up your main menu\nX is used for interacting with people, and options in your menu.\nLB is used for range attacks\nRB is used for switching which ranged attack to use\nBackspace/select  is used to heal\n\nPro's\nFun and interactive combat,\nStart to a great story\ncontoller support (yeah i'm that guy, who loves playing his rpg's with a controller)\nAuto loot ++++\nMusic is pleasant\nThe game is fairly difficult, and requires more than just looking away and choosing the attack option\n\nCon's\nLots of grammar and spelling mistakes (I suck at teh (intentional) spelling and grammer, but I'm not selling a product)\n\nUnresponsive controls are the bane of this game existence.  Action rpg's are fine, but the combat needs to be adjusted to allow far more fluid attacks, and magic.. no reason exist why I should be full MP, press the button and have no magic come, no reason exist why I should press the sword attack button 5 or 6 times before my character eventually attacks..\n\n\nThe Verdict\nSo the meat and potatoes of any review is the verdict, was the game worth playing, and if it was worth playing would I recommend it for other gamers...  The short answer is absolutely....\n\nThe long answer is....  ABSOLUTELY!!!! if you aren't into THESE types of rpg's, then odds are the charm and quaintness will be totally lost on you.  If you have a natural bias against RPG maker or old school games you'll most likely not enough this game at all... (but hey it's cheap and has cards so maybe even you can find a use for it.)  For those who appreciate a well told story (albeit with some spelling and grammar issues) you'll do well to pick this up.  It certainly won't have 50 hours of gameplay, but for 3 dollars what do you expect.  You'll play it, you'll love it, and you'll be wanting the developer to finish up the story (This seems to be an episodic game where you'll get a part of the story now, and then after development is finished have the option of buying??? (not sure) additional episodes to finish out the story)\n\nThe game took me a little over 2 hours to complete, the developer is planning on making this an 8 part game, thus far the game has a pretty good foundation on which to build.","March 26","true","7.2"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","28","37","2","5"

So the combat mechanics is slightly different.\n\nAnother really interesting thing is the 22 Steam achievements. Although you can finished the main quest in 2-3 hours, I actually spend 10 hours, playing the game 3 times, and trying to figure out all the different achievements. This is because the activation of certain events are not too obvious and trying to figure out how to trigger them is part of the fun of the game. There are also different type of exploration puzzles, hidden items, partial keys, etc, that make the game interesting as well. I loved this game.\n\nThe only shortcoming that I can think of for this game is : IT IS TOO SHORT :).\nHowever, as I understand it, this is Part 1 of an 8 part episodic game and that we would be able to carry forward our save game to the next episode.\nThis is really excellent. Furthermore the price of slightly more than $1 for such a game is defintely worth it!!\nI love this game, and would look forward to buying and playing all 8 episodes.\nKeep up the good work, developers... and I definitely recommend this game.\n\n","March 26","true","11.7"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/451920/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2001 products in account","Thorne - Death Merchants is a very simple game, it plays like most RPG Maker games but instead of having turn based party combat, Thorne’s combat is real-time and very fast paced. It really caught me by surprise, it features some nice changes to the default sprites of RPG Maker and it plays in a very different way when compared to other games made with this engine. It is also worth saying that this is the first part of this series but still, the ending is not abrupt or anything, it leaves room for more events to unfold and the story of this part is done, it doesn’t end in a cliffhanger or anything like that.\n\nBefore elaborating on some key aspects of the game, I think it is important to first mention some things that I didn’t enjoy about Thorne. The first one is obviously the lack of voice acting but I guess that for a small indie studio this is somewhat hard to put into a game of this scale. The second complaint I have is the fact that a lot of times, it is not very obvious where doors are located when they are on the sides of the screen. Since you have no 3D view they just look like another corridor or dead end, if you get close enough though you’ll go through that passage and proceed to another room. That said, I did find myself a couple of times looking for a place to go when in fact I just had to run against the wall, so to speak.\n\nStory:You play as Crow, a well known mercenary, and you start your journey in a prison cell being interrogated by a guard. You’re being accused of killing someone in a nearby village and so you are explaining to this guard on how you are not guilty of this crime. This how most of the game takes place, you play as you are telling your story to the guard.\n\nWithout spoiling, the overall story is pretty decent. What appears to be just another set of simple jobs for a reputable mercenary such as yourself leads to a series of events and mystery concerning the little village of Hollow Lake. The villagers ask for your help  because the local noble has been ignoring them and locked himself in his mansion, leaving the villagers defenseless. It is up to you to help these people and investigate a series of murders that have been occurring.\n\nGameplay:The game is pretty simple and therefore there isn’t much you need to know, and what you need to know is explained to you early on. For combat, it plays like an action RPG of sorts, A is your melee attack, S is your ranged ability and Q is heal. When you’re low on HP you can use Rage which gives your attack a little boost but requires you to rest at the inn in order to be able to use it again. The game offers atleast 2 different ranged abilities, daggers and molotovs.\n\nThe game doesn’t hold your hand, you can go after the main quest if you choose to do so or you can just go on different paths and explore the world. The game rewards exploration because while exploring you can find different kinds of loot. Even though the game has a lot of items for you to find that either heal you or cure certain ailments, I never found myself using any of these because there was simply no need. Sometimes, when you kill an enemy, they will drop loot bags but you can also acquire loot merely by walking through the levels, some spots might have something hidden.\n\nThe game has its own menu where you can check your different stats, equip or use items, check your quests, the usual. Still, while the game has various different stats for your character such as strength and agility, the game doesn’t tell you what these do and how they affect your gameplay.\n\nOverall thoughtst:The game features a small but nice soundtrack and the writing is fairly decent even though there’s ocasionally some spelling errors in the dialogue. Combat is serviceable along with level design. Still, for me the story makes up for all the less good aspects of the game. In the end Thorne - Death Merchants is pretty good for its price and I’m looking forward for the next parts of this series.","April 1","true","8.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/451920/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Product received for free\n\nIf you enjoy RPGs -especially those made with RPG Maker- but want something a bit grittier, then Thorne - Death Merchants may be the title to satisfy your cravings. It tells the story of the aforementioned Thorne, also known as the Crow, a mercenary that leaves a trail of dead bodies behind him. Travel through a corrupt world as you meet new people and collect bounties. A fair warning, this game contains quite a bit of vulgar language so some may find it offensive.\n\nThorne has been taken prisoner for a murder he did not commit and most of the game is spent in a flashback as he explains his story to the captain of the guard. The story, and therefore the game, is rather short. Most of it takes place in one village where the murder you’ve been accused of takes place.When Thorne first arrived he only wanted to drink at the tavern but soon found himself knee deep in the village’s problems as he accepts mercenary jobs from the people. The story that unfolds is rather interesting and becomes more complicated than Thorne anticipated. To go further would spoil things but do expect witches, werewolves, corrupt leaders, beautiful women and evil specters.\n\nThe controls of the game pretty simple, you can use your mouse and keyboard to move and attack enemies or you can use a game controller. I found it easier to use a controller but certain things didn’t quite work right. The game gives you no indication of which buttons match which actions, unlike if you use a mouse and keyboard. I never figured out how to use the rage attack with the controller. If the cursor of your mouse is hovering over something it will keep that thing highlighted no matter what you try to select with the controller. That being said, I still appreciated being able to use a controller as I prefer them for RPGs. The user interface isn’t very fancy, a common occurrence in many RPG Maker titles, but it works.\n\nThorne has a basic sword attack, a ranged attack, and a desperation rage move he can use when his health is low. He can also heal himself. Unlike with many games of the genre, battles are not turn based, but real time. Enemies walk around the screen and will engage you if they see you. This will either turn some people off or please some people, either way it is nice to see something different even if it wasn’t my cup of tea. You have the ability to change your gear to fit your play style, however there aren’t many options due to the length of the game and you can get by pretty ok with just using the optimized gear choices. I also found money in the game to be a bit useless since you find plenty of items during your quest, most of which I rarely used, but if you find yourself in a pinch then stock up. You have no other party members which is a shame but makes sense in the story, however you can acquire a wolf companion to aid you in finding treasure. I never used this feature at all but it is needed to acquire certain achievements.\n\nThe artwork in the game is dark and gloomy, fitting the tone of the story. Everything is done in a retro pixel style with well drawn portraits for important characters. There are no cutscenes and the only piece of full artwork is the main title screen which shows Thorne in chains. I did have a bit of an issue with lighting in the game when night fell. I know it’s supposed to be dark at night time but it make it hard for me to see what I was doing and where I was going. The music is in the game is fitting, nothing too amazing but also nothing too annoying either. Everything is in a good balance and nothing seems out of place.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this game is very short and can be completed in two or three hours, maybe four if you’re on the hunt for all of the achievements. My biggest issue with the game was lack of directions. You don’t get a map until near the end of the game and unless you look in every nook and cranny and talk to everyone you possibly can then you’ll miss side quests, and even then some things are time sensitive, which was not indicated in-game. The game has Steam achievements and trading cards and the developers seem to working on new updates and listening to the community. It would see that more episodes of the story are coming in the future which will hopefully flesh the story out more, as of now the price isn’t too bad for the length of the game and it’s a nice change from a lot of the RPG Maker titles currently on the market.\n\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","June 2","true","5.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

In itself the game is quite good but does have problems in lagging especially when playing on Windows XP. To me the game is made more for the use of a game controller than the keyboard and I do not like using keys for the battle system. Leveling up does not seem to do much and the use of points for skill ability is alright, though there are not many skills to use. The game could do with more refinement. I do like the quest inventory as this does help along the way.The actual graphics and scenery are well done. It is very typical of older style RPG's and would be enjoyable to players who like the older style. A dark type of game but overall a good game and I wouild recommend it.","March 30","true","20.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

That and also the incredibly unique fighting mechanics that I haven't seen other RPG Maker games have.\n\nGameplayThis game has a fairly good and interesting story line to the game, it has some unique features to the game that differentiate it from the generic run of RPG Maker games. Let's start off with the basic of wat the story is behind this game. You start off as a Crow, a man who has been framed and is now trapped in a dungeon shackled up. The story retells what actually happened, full of blood shed of a murder that you didn't commit. But who framed him? The story expands as you play through the game and find out what really happened that night the murder happened. The game has some really unique mechanics to fighting and looting that other games like this don't even touch on. The fighting mechanic isn't your standard turn-based random RPG battles. It plays more like a action game, you can weild certian weapons, are able to throw certain weapons and have to kill enemies in real time. No turn based combat here. There is automatic looting when you push against say a box and it has loot, it'll automatically give you the items that where in that box therefore not really wasting time by having to click a few speech boxes saying what each item is. This really puts a new spin on RPG Maker games, and really sets the game higher bar and shows that you can make really great games with RPG Maker. Athough the game is rather unique, it does have it's unfortunate cons as well. The game does eem rather short, I completed the game in just over 2 hours. Apparently this game is going to have more parts to it, so that's not all that bad. Here's hoping the other parts will be as good as this one.\n\nPros+ Very unique mechanics\n+ Very interesting story-line\n+ Decent for the asking price\n+ Trading Cards & Achievements\n\nCons- A little too short, but apparently there are more parts to this series\n\nResult / Final thoughtsThis is a very unique and well thought out RPG Maker game. It's not another generic RPG Maker game, it really makes the game it's own and does it very well. Interesting new mechanics and fighting system that takes a new turn on these types of games. Very interesting story and well thought out level design.\n\nRating 9.5/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Good Games Giveaways & Reviews curator group here.","March 27","true","4.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

This however does not sway my opinion.\n\n+ Interesting world, combined with wonderful maps\n+ Nice soundtrack\n+ Cheap\n+ Nameable Pet wolf\n+ Achievements are easily attainable\n+/- Battles aren’t too hard\n- Slow transitions and typos\n- Missable optional cutscenes\n- Missable items\n\nThorne – Death Merchants is a short game (2~4 hours), the first of a series of eight standalone episodic games. It’s a well-made game by experienced developers that is also being sold quite cheap! It features an interesting world with lovely looking environments and gray characters everywhere. The soundtrack is great and fits the game well. The game also allows you to have a pet wolf, whom you can name, pet, feed and command to search around for treasures. This was a pretty neat idea, though my wolf got stuck from time to time and it took me a while to realize I needed to let the wolf follow me, instead of using the whistle to call it to me. While the treasure hunting idea was fun, I didn’t really get into money or health trouble, so it was moot most of the time. In fact, if it wasn’t because of the achievements I wouldn’t have searched around at all. For the achievement hunters, this game has 22 easily enough attainable ones. Some of them are linked to optional and time-sensitive cutscenes, side-quests, treasure hunting, so you might miss a few of them at the end of the game.\n\nI’m not a ARPG fan or even someone with a lot of experience playing these type of games, and while I died several times playing this game, I do have to say the battles aren’t that hard, with the exception of one or two. It helps that there aren’t that many skills: there’s heal, ranged and close melee and that’s it. I enjoyed the battle system and enjoyed that unless you Leroy Jenkins it, you won’t die. Perhaps others will find this too easy, but I found it just right.\n\nThe game does have flaws, however. There’s the slow transitions between areas and the typos in the English game. While they annoyed me a bit, they weren’t detriment to my overall enjoyment of TDM. (The developer is also aware of these and has promised fixes.) What irked me more was how easy you could miss optional cutscenes, as well as items. I had trouble defeating the Abyss Mermaid, until I learned I was actually missing an item, needed to defeat her. Near the end of the game I still hadn’t found it; apparently I had walked past the location of it.  I don’t mind the system this game used for finding items, in fact I actually liked it. However, I feel that sparkling indications for the item in question would have been better. As for the missable cutscenes, I actually did miss one and so the reveal after the final boss battle came out of nowhere for me. To be fair, the story still made sense, but I’m a sucker for story and world/character building scenes.\n\nTo conclude, Thorne – Death Merchants was a nice intro to its series, leaving me anxiously looking forward to the next.\n","March 29","true","8.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","2"

However, it was so little help and so long ago, that I actually forgot about this game for a while. I had to be told that I mapped some parts of it, and I still don't remember doing it. But, that's my life.\n\nAlso, I played this on  a crappy borrowed laptop, so there was a lot of lag on the larger maps, and I didn't hear any music or soundtrack. Sound effects were fine, just no music. Again, crappy borrowed laptop, so I don't know if anyone else will have that problem. And due to the lag, I simply wasn't able to play very far into it, just up to the lighthouse part, so this will not be a complete review, simply my first impressions of it.\n\nAnyway, Thorne - Death Merchants is the story of Thorne, a cynical and foul-mouthed mercenary, told in media res to his jailer for crimes yet to be revealed, as he begrudgingly helps the residents of a town under great turmoil.  It seems that the local governor of the town has lost his wee little mind and gone on a bit of a killing spree, so Thorne agrees to hunt the psycho down and deal him some Charles Bronson-style street justice. But, being an RPG, things are never that simple, and Thorne gets pulled into something bigger than simple hired vigilantism.\n\nThe game itself looks very good, even for an RM game. The sprites are large and detailed, and the environments are lush and quite nice to look at; the dungeons, rather than being a series of narrow tunnels, seems to borrow design elements from the "//dot.hack" series, in that they're big, wide open spaces, full of enemies, wrong turns, and treasures.\n\nCombat is different than most RM games; instead of the usual turn-based system most games use, Thorne borrows the top-down real time button mashing system our friend from Hyrule has enjoyed for so many years. Press one button to slash your sword (and enjoy Thorne's manly grunts of exertion in the doing!), press another to throw a knife or molotov, another to heal, and another to enter rage mode. This is a nice, and refreshing change of pace from the usual static 'Final Fantasy' model, even if I personally love that model.\n\nThere are a few gripes with the game, but that might just be chalked up to personal preference. Thorne, as near as I can tell, NEVER levels up, so he's as strong at the start of the game as he's ever going to be. Luckily, you can equip up to four accessories to increase stats, so that should counter-balance it nicely.  There also seems to be some issues with getting caught on the maps, being stuck on doors and walls. This can get especially irritating when you're trying to avoid an unkillable enemy. Another thing that mildly irked me was the way you find treasure. Near as I can tell, you find it by just randomly walking over it, which...is not great. Basically, you're pixel hunting, which in a game where everybody and their dog, and their dog's brother is trying to kill you, is a maddening affair. And to add to that frustration, there are invisible traps that will gouge your health quickly, making pixel-hunting a bit of a horror show.\n\nThere are also a few grammatical slips, but I'm hardly in any position to nitpick on that.\n\nIn closing, Thorne - Death Merchants is an interesting, beautifully detailed adventure that will devour hours of your time with sidequests and battles.  Think of it as Game of Thrones, set in Hyrule, and you'll have a general idea of what to expect.","March 26","true","3.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

I just more don't than I do.\nI played 9 minutes of this game. Here's what killed an already uphill battle for this title to win me over:\n\nFull Screen - although a mouse click was sufficient to make selections in the title menu, I had to use arrows/directional keys to select Full Screen, this was not explained. So I think a good 5 minutes of the my play time was actually just trying to get to full screen, which was found through a forum, and the answer wasn't even, "oh yeah, you gotta randomly use arrow keys all of a sudden in that particular menu, which is contradictory of 100% of your previous experience... the previous menu". Nah, man. They dropping some alt+enter knowledge.\n\n(alleged) Full Controller Support - so I must have missed class the day that the exact meaning of full controller support was covered, but my frame of reference that was crafted through countless hours in other games told me that when a game says it has "full controller support", that it's going to be a seamless experience, probably with such perks as when I flip on my controller, all of a sudden all prompts, commands, etc, transition to be relevant to a controller. Such is not the case with this game. Not only does the controller need to be on prior to launching, I just can't seem to find where the ♥♥♥♥ Q and W are on my controller. I'll keep searching. I hope I find some support.\n\nCharacter Voice Mod Technology - one thing not advertised, but a quirky feature nonetheless, is that Thorne/TheCrow/Aragorn shrieks through a drive-thru window voice mod device each time he attacks. That's just what I'm trying to listen to in an arpg. My character screaming with some mild distortion/static ad nauseum while I pile the bodies high.","March 29","false","0.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","3"

Add to this a great plot, interesting quests and unique combat system.

The plot is intriguing and the characters are believable. The dialogue is both mature and entertaining. I could definitely see a sequel to expand on the current plot.\n\nThe game is a little flawed though:\n\n1) The grammar and spelling could use some polishing.\n\n2) Manipulating the wolf is a rather wonky process, as he tends to get stuck behind obstacles and keep a rather long distance from you; I guess he likes his personal space? It would also be nice if you could point to where you specifically want the wolf to search within a reasonable distance of the main character.\n\n3) You really don't have a need for much of the game's currency (Rowens), as you can often find things to survive by just roaming and defeating enemies, or having the wolf search for things. Might want to improve on that for the sequel.\n\nSome optional interaction with the ladies who take payment for a good time (can't write the W word here lol) could be fun too but that feature would likely offend many players.\n\nOn a side note, the rhythm of the Hornhold theme makes me think of "Exes and Ohs" by Elle.","April 15","true","15.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

You're basically in this one town and you get a few quests (about ten including side quests) to learn some history of it's residents and the surrounding country...the game just felt like just an introduction - there was no real climax or ending.\n\nEDIT: Was experiencing major lag - but after upgrading to Windows 10 the problem somehow fixed itself, so...","April 1","false","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"
