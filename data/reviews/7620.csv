"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayresome/recommended/7620/","ayresome","Ayresome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayresome/","352 products in account","This was a great game when released, but now it's showing its age. It's satisfyingly challenging, especially on the higher difficulty settings.\n\nIt's fun laying out your railway and you get a good sense of getting better at the game the more you play it, as you get involved with the more advanced functions, such as personal wealth and the stock market. The differing goals on each level, the changing emphasis depending on the year and the big shift between difficulty levels are easily enough to hold your interest over the long-term. While there's some luck involved, particularly with the economy, success is mostly a case of skill and planning. The economic model is good enough, if not spectacular.\n\nOn the downside, the user interface looks and feels like it was designed in 1998 (as it was). It can be hard finding some of the more important functions (or even the existence of them in some cases). I would recommend at least scanning through the manual.\n\nThe graphics are perfectly functional - as an isometric rather than a 3D game, they've aged better than most of this vintage. The intra-level cutscenes set the scene for the level quite well. I enjoyed the bluegrass music, even though I'm not a fan of the genre - it fits the pace of the game exactly.\n\nAs in common with many games in this genre, there's a "tipping point" at each level where you're sure that you'll be successful. The game has ten speed levels and this comes in very handy at that point.\n\nIf you're having trouble deciding, "Railroad Tycoon 3" is definitely the better game, particularly the economic model and user interface. However this can be difficult to get running on modern systems. "Railroads!" is almost a different kind of game, much easier and less in-depth - I didn't like it.\n\nIf you like management sims, you should get a lot of enjoyment out of this, particularly as it's so cheap. If you're not sure, or haven't played that style of game much, you'll probably be better off buying something more modern.","November 27, 2013","true","19.2"," 98 of 105 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","98","105","0","3"

It engages your brain - memory and planning are paramount - while also having an excellent American folk soundtrack of guitars and harmonicas.  Daft numbers of scenarios & campaigns, all with inherent replayability, can be boosted to astronomical proportions (https://codeload.github.com/oseparovic/RRT2Maps/zip/master << that's a metric f*ck-tonne of extra maps & scenarios).  I have a thing for older games - they tended to be more demanding and more mentally stimulating than modern games - and this fully lives up to those ideals.\n\nThe game consists of competing with AI or human-controlled opponents (or not, if that's what you want) to connect trade resources on a map, against the backdrop of a potentially lethal economy and advancing technology.  The right scenarios (in the zip I linked to above) will let you go for >150 years - some are even without a time limit - but you typically are presented goals - specific things to achieve by a specific time, in order to get a bronze, silver or gold medal (these goals are usually along the lines of "Connect point x to point y, move twelvety tonnes of cargo K between those two points and amass $------ personal fortune by date z").\n\nI give you fair warning, the graphics aren't going to blow you away, not by a long shot, but the complexity, detail and the intense addictiveness of the game should tickle you if you're prone to being tickled by a game of this type.","December 17, 2014","true","11.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","0"

Turkey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WhiskeyDoctor/","101 products in account","If you are an analytical, logistics-oriented person who can coalesce money and talent around you to achieve ambitious goals, please submit your application to Railroad Tycoon 2 platinum.\n\nI played this game when it first came out, it's still as solid a title now as it was then, and the mechanics and controls have aged well. While some of the campaign can be quite merciless, I hardly see how that's a problem (considering today's trends towards easy instant satisfaction games).\n\nThe AI on the map can leave something to be desired. They build weird routes, and often never expand beyond their two city connections for many years. However, what they lack in physical construction prowess they make up for with their brutal manipulation of the in-game stock market. Which is a peeve, because the market can be very hard to keep up on while you're trying to build a route through rugged mountain terrain, only to find that the dickhole AI has bought out your company, repossessed all of your assets that you put up to start said company, and then locked you out of your office so they can take a big dump on your desk.\n\nBut I digress. For the price of the game on the Steam marketplace, you will get a solid return on your investment. hours of fun. Hours of mind numbing track laying, split-screening market trading, and maxing out your profit by alternatively trimming routes and tuning the makeup of the various trains that ply them.","June 16, 2015","true","40.4"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","19","21","7","0"

Another game resurrected from the mists of time and childhood memories of playing this game as a starry-eyed child with my train-obsessed father. Once the shine of nostalgia had worn away a little, however, I found myself able to give a more..objective review of the game. The positives? Well, the music is great, the attention to detail (particularly with the trains and historical aspects) is pretty impressive, and the gameplay, at its core, is quite addictive. As you play, you find yourself eager to expand your railway, to explore the map and find out what locomotive will be unlocked next. There's also an impressive array of scenarios/maps to play, and an amusing level editor. However, one drawback I found is that the game can be rather confusing. There are no proper tutorials, none that I could find anyway (occasional hint boxes hardly count), and it's scarily easy to run out of money, which in turn annoys your investors and nets you a game over. The interface can be rather confusing, and at the risk of sounding stupid, I don't really understand the financial side of the game (bonds and stock, etc) and how that all works. All that being said though, if you can wrap your head around the confusing mechanics, this is still a timeless classic of a game, and very enjoyable. Not the best, but definitely recommended as a cheap time-waster.","September 2, 2014","true","0.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

The game ranges from simple difficulties where you just relax, transport goods around and build new tracks, to full fledged industry operations where every dollar must be spent wisely, you can compete with the AI or other players at both the train stations and the financial markets, and the goods must be delivered from and to specific locations to get enough profit out of it.\n\nOn the wrong side, the UI  would have needed way more tooltips, and the game is generally obscure in what does what and why.\n\nOverall, a good choice if you like trains and that old game vibe.","November 27, 2013","true","21.2"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

You may trust my review.\nThis ain't yo mamma's kind of game. No this ain't. Railroad Tycoon 2, in my opinion the best of all train games new or old, is one that'll make you frustrated by all means whilst keeping you up till all hours of the night. Let me explain why.\n\nThe rail building is not easy. You must pick your terrain carefully and stategically. Mountains will cost you more, and slow your trains down. Plains are cheaper and don't require heavy-duty 3-Truck Shay trains. Deciding which cities to connect together via a rail also takes thought. The larger the city, the more passenger and mail revenue is to be had. The maps in this game are realistically made (Alaska map looks like Alaska).\n\nBut when you do finally get your rail system figured out, it's time to turn to the Stock Market. Very useful in making lots of personal cash, issuing stock for some extra company cash, or merging with another rail company. Invest wisely, the AI in this game were created intelligently. For example if you see Jay Gould in your game (look him up:) watch your back, while other tycoons may not even utilize the Market at all. Every tycoon Character in this game has a different personality.\n\nSo in conclusion, this game is 17+ years old and out of every rail game out right now, I still choose to play ol' RRT2. Yes max res is 1024 x 768, maybe an HD version would pop up someday? This game takes time to learn, but once down you will definently need a better office chair and a comfortable mouse pad. Also there are websites out to download user created maps/scenarios, and a map editor to create your own (this comes with game). Much replayability.","December 25, 2015","true","202.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

I remember the first Railroad Tycoon that was on 3.5" floppy disks and you had to look in the manual to identify the train that was shown in order to login to the game (which was a neat way to do DRM i thought).\n\nAnywho the whole point is that i like this game the most out of all 3, with the first iteration coming in a close 2nd behind this one.  The third tycoon game i really didnt enjoy at all sadly.  The only thing about this game that i do NOT like (the steam version that is) is that i can't seem to get it in window mode at all.  when i select window mode in game it says to change your desktop resolution (which is normally 1920x1080 but gets scaled down to 1024x768 when the game executes) however obviously it cannot be changed as when alt+tab'ing out of the game to change it it switches back to native 1920x1080.  Also adding the '-window', '-sw' or '-startwindowed' monnicker does nothing as well to the steam startup options.\n\nThat minor quibble aside though, if you like trains and you like simulation games i would recommend this.","December 26, 2013","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This meant that the player had much more contol over the flow of traffic, and was not assisted by the 'ghost train' system used in RT2 and subsequent releases.\n\nYou had to plan your schedule to avoid conflicts not just rely upon trains to lass magically through each other.  As such getting it wrong resulted in actually train crashes and loss of reputation, drop in customers, and a fall in the share price.\n\nI miss that level of immersion in the game, and it means that TTD now has the edge as far as this type of game is concerned.","February 9, 2015","false","20.7"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","11","23","2","0"

Almost wish I was into tycoon sims back when this came out but glade I got it now.\n\nAlso to add...its packed full of different resources,train engines, and complex gameplay to keep the intelligence levels great for all difficulty types. You play from the early 1800s to the 1900s in the vanilla, then in the 2nd Century (its included expansion) you play from bout the 1850-2000 + or so.Game has sandbox mode that you can set when you start and a good amount of replay value.\n\nOnly nagging point I have about the game is the mechanics behind setting up your trains routes.The trains you have to put specific cars on so that they can pick up or drop off an item,problem is sometimes a place might not have what your train needs , so you would want to set the station to only give you what the station has.However doing this (despite having the cars already) puts new ones on which takes loading time. Since this game is a race against the clock and pausing can hold up lines, you understand how this can be annoying.\n\nOther than that love the game.If you looking for a more hardcore simulator this one is not it.Its a strategy game first and fore most with sim elements.I suggest * OpenTTD (f2p)[www.openttd.org] ,* Simutrans (f2p)[www.simutrans.com], or * Transport Giant Gold Edition $9.99[www.gamersgate.com]","January 14, 2011","true","24.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm not overly concerned about graphics so I figured this game would stand the test of time. Unfortunately in my opinion it doesn't.  What I originally remember being a fairly complex and challenging simulation turns out to be a pretty easy strategy game that gets very tedious very quickly.  Multiple times in my 12 hours of game play I started a new game on the most challenging settings hoping to get a good tough scenario.  Each time very early on all challenge was gone and i was able to build at will, buy up all real estate, and have no concerns as to the ownership of my company.  Just pick a starting place with a few decent cities near by, watch the needs of the city, and build accordingly.

I spent 1 dollar on this game and it was not worth it at all! First of all, the graphics are badly aged and are horrible to watch. Also when I started the game, the cursor looked like a ♥♥♥♥♥. I am serious, it looked like a ♥♥♥♥♥. I was poking around with a ♥♥♥♥♥ trying to understand the interface. The ♥♥♥♥♥ was supposed to represent an upside down hammer, but it pretty much looked like a ♥♥♥♥♥! The interface and controls are also horrible. You can't move the camera with your mouse, AND you need to press a ♥♥♥♥ing button for EVERYTHING. THERE ARE NO KEYBINDINGS. You need to poke on the map with your "♥♥♥♥♥" to move around.

It has improvements over the great original Railroad Tycoon, it's more realistic, there's more stuff to do, they've of course improved the graphics in the intervening the years but I don't know...it's just not fun.\n\nI haven't played this game in some time so can't go into many details.  One thing I do remember being annoyed with is that there's a limit to how many computer players you can have on each map.  There's no reason for this.  It's not a memory issue.  On some maps you can have 32 players (or something) but on others, you can only have two.  There's no rhyme or reason.  It's not really related to map size or anything like this.  Also, on the maps with 32 or whatever players, more than half of those players NEVER BUILD ANYTHING.  They just put all of their money in the stock market trying to get rich that way.  Kind of stupid.\n\nAnyway, hopefully they've made better railroad-building simulation games since this.  Don't bother looking at Railroad Tycoon 3 or Sid Meier's Railroads, though.  They're total crap.\n\nPwninator score: 5/10","September 16, 2013","false",""," 2 of 32 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","2","32","0","0"

With the performance graphics card the game is playble but the videos don't show and at times you have to unlock it with mouse clicks.\nThere are two campaigns and a number of scenarios, ranging from the pionnering days of the railroad in the 1800's to futuristic scenarios in 2050. There are scenarios for all continents (even Antartica!) and lots of countries.\nBut the real goal of the game is to become rich, very rich, beyond your wildest dreams!\nYou can do that investing on the stock market, but take care because you can also endup penniless! In the hard levels there is cut-throat competition and the AI can make you sweat.\nI liked this game better than its successors (Railroad Tycoon 3 and Sid Meier's Railroads), even if the graphics are not as good, but the game is more balanced, RRT3 is to complex and SMRR is to simple.","January 15, 2015","true","82.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Came back to it on Steam and remembered why I liked it so much to begin with. Lots to do and lots to learn while the same scenarios will play out differently each time thanks to radomized map resources and random events.\n\nThere is much strategy to had - certain resources require other resources to make them even more successful (bring grain to a cattle farm and then send the cattle bounty to the slaughterhouse. From there, food is generated that you can send on to a city demanding it. There's nothing like seeing the massive payday of a cross-country haul reach its destination. Or stay out of commodities and simply set up a passenger/mail route between to major hubs.\n\nDifferent cities/towns require different resources. Routes will vary as you pass through mountains and over rivers as will cost to build your track network and bridges. Your opponents will do what it takes to bring you down, including set up profitable routes in your backyard, buy stock in your company, or buy local businesses that you helped to become lucrative - beat them to the punch and buy those steel mills, factories, and cattle farms before they do. Buy stock in your company or a competitor's company. Deal with economic swings, advancing train technologies, and the judgement of your Board of Directors - it's all here.\n\nThe graphics are surely dated by 2010s standards but I can look beyond that limitation to recapture the fun I had with this classic title - even now I get lost in this title for hours. Of all of the strategic railroad sims out there currently (in 2015), I still feel that RRT2 is the best of the pack.","March 12, 2015","true","59.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is truly one of my favorite PC games of all time. I’m happy to see it works great on my Win 7 x64 system. As far as the game itself, it’s a plain and simple railroad manager with dated graphics and horrible sound (as compared to current games). However, the gameplay is fun and it can be a challenge at times not to go bankrupt. What I've always liked about this game, was the ability to customize it. You can customize your in game character by typing in a new name and selecting a new portrait. You can customize your company by changing your logo, renaming it, and by renaming your trains & the cities/towns in which they serve. The game also sports a map/scenario editor for further customizations. As far as the "tycoon" aspect goes, the gameplay allows for the issuance of stocks & bonds, setting dividends, hiring and firing of managers, and instigating mergers and hostile takeovers. This game was one of the best - if not the best, in the Tycoon series back in the day.

It is definitely worth checking out even today.\n\nWhere to begin with Railroad Tycoon II?\n\nI could start with both the campaigns. The Platinum edition has two campaigns: The "Original" Railroad Tycoon II campaign and the Second Century campaign.  Both cover a wide swath of history and geography, ranging from building the Trans-Siberian Railway to the introduction of railroads in the United States. While some of the scenarios in these campaigns are just simple train-routing puzzles, most of the campaign scenarios are quite meaty, taking a good half-hour to two hours to complete.\n\nI could mention the vast number of maps that this package includes. In addition to the campaign, the Platinum edition includes 50 other maps of varying quality and a map editor if you're interested in making more. Like the campaign, these can range in playtime from a half hour to several hours per map. However, since this is an older game, I'm not sure how many other folks are making new maps for this game these days.\n\nI could mention the replay value of all of those maps. The game has a semi-random distribution of industries at every map start, which makes each play-though subtly different.\n\nI could mention the nearly two hours of blues music that is the game's soundtrack, or the attention to detail in the game's artwork. While it is stuck in isometric view, the game's graphics don't feel particularly dated to me. The only quibbles I've got is the lack of support for wide-screen resolutions (which didn't really exist when it was made).\n\nBut, overall, I think the core gameplay as a logistics puzzle and business game is Railroad Tycoon II's strongest element. The gameplay is truly 'easy to learn, difficult to master'. The idea of "Deliver one iron, one coal to a steel mill, then take that steel to a Tool and Die factory which produces one goods to take to a town" is simple, but actually delivering it all, at a profit, is a real challenge. The player gets all sorts of interesting decisions along the way: From where to route track to how to finance the whole operation to what locomotive to choose.","June 24, 2014","true","122.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Set up supply chains, deliver products, make money!\n\nRailroad Tycoon 2 does that, and does a pretty good job of it.\n\nThings I like\nFlexibility: you get to decide where your tracks go, how you load the trains and even though you can program routes to do what you want over and over, you can micromanage if you want.\nHistorical Trains: The game tells a bit about the historical context behind the different scenerios, which is fun. The trains are based on actual trains that were used. The cargos that you can carry evolve as the years pass (Oil doesn't become an useful cargo until after a certain year, for example)\nWorldwide settings: With scenerios set all over the world, any place that trains were important you get to try your hand at setting up your own empire.\n\nThings that bothered me\nI never really got the hang of the mechanic for driving your opponents out of business by buying them, or investing in them. Maybe I just wasn't paying close enough attention or something, but it seemed really tough to figure out what to buy, and when, and whether doing so would have the desired outcome.\nSometimes putting a track down at just the place you want can be fiddly... that's probably unavoidable, but I found myself spending hours on pause just sorting out the best way to lay track between Germany and Italy, and I haven't yet figured out how to get track laid effectively in Japan.\n\nOverall, this game was totally worth it for me.
