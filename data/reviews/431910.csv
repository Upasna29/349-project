You fly with kitty 3min through a spiral of obstacles. You can dodge, duck and jump. Unfortunately sometimes you get catched even if you don't touch the obstacle or just your tail was there. So pretty mean mechanics. Because there's no continue and no further control over flight or duck length it's very frustrating. Keep on trying and just stand through the 3 min.","February 10","false","5.6"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","25","35","0","0"

If you hit an obstacle the timer and music and everything starts again, which is annoying because there seems to be only one music track. If I remember rightly Super Hexagon  had more, not just for the different difficulties but every couple of times you hit an obstacle the song would switch between one of a couple of tracks which made it feel a bit less repetive.  It's a lot less sleek than Super Hexagon and to be honest I only managed to play twenty minutes of this compared with several hours of that, partially because the music is purposefully awful, but there's only one track of it, partially because the control switching is irritating. Super Hexagon was stylish and insanely difficult, this just seems designed to annoy.\n\nI paid about seventy pence for this, that's about as much as a can of coke. Honestly I'm not sure there's enough here to justify it even costing that.","February 10","false","0.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","2"

You try so hard to beat the game, but you just cannot. You try for hours, days, weeks, months and even years. Still, no success. Once you want to quit the game, you just cannot. You want to play, you want to beat the game. It is becoming an addiction now, and you can't stop. You don't go to school/work, you sit down and play, all day. Years go by and you are still trying to win just to FIND the answer. You've wasted 10 years of your damn life, trying to find the answer. And after 10 years, you start to think wisely. You try to find ways to master the game.. but you CAN'T. But you still need to complete your last goal on your bucket list... FIND the ANSWER.\n\nSo, after like 20 more years, you grow a beard, grow a mustache, whatever. But you are still there, sitting down and trying to beat the game. But then, someone comes in and tells you to search it the answer up online. You sit, you stare.\n\n10/10 - would waste 20 years of my life trying to find the answer\n\nBut really, this game is my new addiction. Only got a couple of minutes on record right now, but tomorrow, it's a new day, it's a new day to try to beat the game. ;)\nReally hard and it will easily become your addiction if you are a really curious person.","February 4","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
