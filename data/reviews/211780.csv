But once you learn to pass through some of the lumps, the game is rock solid. The game has a quasi-realistic atmosphere to it, you die quickly, but there's still tons of fire fights to keep you excited. The ability to switch between squad members is an astounding feature that I wish most games would have today. Level design is above par with most games today, open ended with no signs that say, "You must go this way."\n\nAll in all I'd recommend this to somebody looking for an old school solid 3rd person military shooter.","December 22, 2013","true","3.0"," 72 of 75 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","72","75","0","0"

Because the squad consists of merely 2 to 4 unique soldiers, progressing through the game will actually have you grow a heavy attachment toward them (some more than others, due to either preferring a specific weapon set or merely for the personality of the character). For this reason, this game could be considered the original Team Fortress, and the game's sequels further elaborates upon their existing personalities.\n\nAs the squad is your most viable resource, you are made to take extra precautions to ensure the safety of every man. This is a very fun task as you are given almost literally complete control over everything your squad does. Don't want Foley to carry his sniper rifle for some reason? Give it to Bradley! Don't even want Foley to participate? Leave him behind! I must admit, the storyline and graphics are sadly not quite up to standard and could use some work, but in the end the gameplay is all that matters, and it more than makes up for the lack of creative in-game dialogue and pleasing textures.\n\nThe best thing about this game in my opinion is the freedom you're presented upon entering a mission. I've already explained controlling the squad, but another aspect that many other games don't seem to implement very often is the freedom to be able to tackle the situation anyway you desire. Whether it means trying to find and destroy every enemy vehicle and collect every weapon pickup, or merely sprint through each stage achieving the bare minimum, as long as you achieve the task one way or another it doesn't matter.\n\nThis game is great stuff, and I hope to see some of the other games in this franchise in the Steam store sometime, perhaps even with a more stable multiplayer mode or something.","June 28, 2014","true","7.7"," 55 of 63 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","55","63","0","0"

I played all of the Conflict series and enjoyed every one of them. They are squad based games with you in control of four characters. You can swap between the players via various commands. Great game play and considering this game is over a decade old decent graphics. Better than the early Tom Clancy games. Highly recommended. I hope to see the second Desert Storm game that had improved graphics and also the third in the series Conflict Vietnam (my favorite). The fourth was the best of the bunch w.r.t graphics, that was released six years ago and is called conflict Global Storm. The final one is Conflict Denied Ops which has been available for a few years on Steam; I don't consider it as part of the original series because you control only two characters. I'm surprised its taken so long to get this one on Steam.

I'm suprised at how much I still enjoy it all these years later. The graphics are actually very good, considering how long ago this was made. The actual gameplay is just brilliant and provides a good challenge. The AI is way better than I thought it would be. Just to give you an example, I entered this small cabin and about three enemies came running in and I shot them down. They fell just outside the doorway. I waited for a while and assumed all was good. As I stepped foot outside, I was raked down by four guys waiting for me to leave, presumable after seeing the dead bodies. Even today, games don't have that kind of complexity to their AI. Granted it could have been coincidence. Nevertheless, this is a solid game and great fun. I'm suprised that the Conflict games didn't go on to become what arma is now. Definitely worth a buy, especially if you played this when you were younger.

There is a bug where if you try to fall off of something or even walk down a slope you either get stuck or start to float and extremely slowly fall to the ground. ive decided to just get it on PS2 as it was actually cheaper. if there is someway of modifying the game to fix these bugs, then it would be great. But for now I'm just going to play it on console. Also, tabbing out and back in makes the game run super fast, which is hilarious, but also annoying. But that can be fixed by just reloading (as simple as: save game, load game. But then thats just wasting time)\n\nExample: on the second mission there is a part with a broken bridge, but because walking onto the slop counted as falling down i couldnt get onto the slope","May 23","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

So i was just searching around today and found that it was on steam "OH MY GOD" i dont think £5 has ever left my bank account so quickly.......so i load up the game and just to get my basings on the controls i load up the basic training. i found the vertical sensetivity far to high, no worries, i'll turn it down. went back into the game, barely and difference......i reloaded the game......still no difference.......the vertical sensetivity when using a mouse is FAR too high even on its loest settings (my mouses settings and the games) so much so, the game was unplayable. I really wanted this game to work, sadly without using a controller i guess it wont, if i hear about this issue being fixed i will try again but for now, thank god for the refund system.","August 7, 2015","false","1.1"," 4 of 20 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","4","20","2","0"

This is offically my most favorite game ever, of all time. Despite the slightly odd default controls, there is no real down side to this game if you don't mind playing an older game. Desert Storm has cars, tanks, explosives, and guns. The PC version has a legitimate multiplayer mode, not just co-op like the console version (which kinda freaked me out). This is not one of those pesky run and gun shooters, this game requires legitimate strategy and cooperation. Did I meation that this game is awesome yet? Because it is. (This review is slightly biased, but I did at one point almost sell this game because I raged at it so much. So glad I didn't!)","December 19, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played this game over multiple times back when I owned a PS2 and it never got old. After playing it again on PC, it's just as fun as when I first played it on PS2, but compared to a lot of newer squad-based shooters, it definitely shows its age. The PC port is almost identical to the PS2 version (can't compare it to the Xbox version, since I never played it on Xbox), however there are a few small issues with the PC version.\n\nI've noticed that there are some sound glitches when firing in single shot mode quickly. Some of the gun sound fx don't play with each mouse press, but this isn't a huge issue. The other PC-specific issue I've noticed is that custom key bindings don't seem to function, however, I don't know if this functionality was ever implemented in the first place. The default key bindings work okay, but I found myself in several situations where I needed to both move and access my inventory or give a squadmate an order. When opening up either the inventory or the squad menu, my character would stop moving, and in quite a few cases, that opened me up to enemy fire. Not good.\n\nThe pluses far outweigh the few with Conflict Desert Storm. The missions are solid and some can take multiple attempts to "get right" if I try to go for a stealth playthrough. The game mechanics are well-thought out, and include things like fire options (ie semi, burst, and full auto), issuing squad commands and being able to give or take items from teammates inventories. If you're looking to take a trip down memory lane or want to experience a unique squad-based shooter, I definitely recommend it.","December 20, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the top, I'll do some Pros/Cons, and underneath, I'll write my own thoughts of the game, for any of you who are interested. I will not base this review around nostalgia\n\nPROS:\n+Tactical, different gameplay [Switching between all 4 characters at will, inventory/equipment management]\n\n+Incredible fun with friends [EG. Of 2 players, each gets 2 characters, includes item giving, stealing items from corpses if you wish, tactical gameplay is great with friends]\n\n+Character switching [Sick of issuing commands and waiting for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI to do it? You can still do that. Or switch to them, and position them yourself]\n\n+Scavenge items from the warzone including medkits, weapons, ammo, equipment\n\n+Weapon specialists, each character is more efficient with the weapon they were trained to use, and can be trained throughout campaign by continuously using that kind of gun\n\n+Details for realism [If a character dies after going down, they will be replaced in the next mission by a new character, throughout the campaign]\n\n+TANKS ARE ♥♥♥♥ING SCARY! But weaker at the back, and can be snuck up on to place C4 or mines against. Several times I have had to kamikaze tanks. Not because I was forced to, just by choice, I guess\n\nCONS:\n- Controls can be a BIT dodgy. Not too bad, but I did have to check the keybindings a few times\n\n- Graphics may not be what you can consider to be good. This of course is opinion wise, I appreciate the graphics, but purely just because I played this when I was younger\n\n- Draw distance is a bit... shoddy. Alright, it's very ♥♥♥♥\n\n\n\nALRIGHT, SO, MY OWN OPINION IF YOU GIVE A FLYING ♥♥♥♥\n\nPersonally, I love this game. A lot. It's such a tactical-feeling shooter, just feeling the joy of positioning all soldiers, in say, the level where you defend your crashed helicopter from waves of tanks, helis, and ground soldiers. I postioned them all in little cracks in the dry desert terrain, and when I completed doing this, which can be done with precision due to controlling all of them, after I did this, I looked at my line of defence... and I just felt like I had to protect all of these soldiers.\n\nI love how, when all soldiers are down, except for whoever you are that is left, and there's 1 tank, 2 ground soldiers are still standing, and it's up to you to save them. I experienced this, without any medkits, and hardly any ammo on my person. So, I snuck over to our squad leader, Bradley, and took his silenced pistol, then shot the ground soldier as quickly as I could after turning the corner, and the tank did not hear. I then crawled like a lil sneaky worm over to Connors [I was playin as Foley, the sniper] and took his 2 RPGs, and 5 of his medkits, of which he had 6 left. I crouched, and fired both rockets at the tank, the first one hitting the weak side armour, the second hitting the weakest back armour. Tank go boom. I revive all soldiers, and we move on.\n\nFUN ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ DUDE!!!","January 1","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
