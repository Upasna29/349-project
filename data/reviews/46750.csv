Even though I recommend it, I don't for $13. It's more of a under $5 game. Also if you are looking for a really creepy game that keeps you on your toes, and/or have balls of steel, then this game might not be for you. This game has a few good jump scares but for the most part you end up losing the fear until the jump scare puts you back into it. And if you are pretty comfy with most horror games then the jump scares will make you jump a bit then be like "Meh." Finally, if you want a 'simple' game that is easy to play, then this isn't for you either. The puzzles are hard and for most of the game me and my friend had a guide we would go to every time we couldn't figure what to do.\n\nWith all the said, Me and my friend enjoyed the game. The surroundings were spooking, the story was interesting. Hell the main reason we didn't want to stop was because we wanted to figure things out. Why was he there? What were those statue? The Voice acting is pretty bad though, I remember asking my friend if they just pulled some guy off the coding crew to voice the main character. I think that might be my biggest complaint, that the voice acting was horrible. It really pulled you out of the game whenever they spoke, especially the main character. But I've dealt with worse.\n\nIf you are easily creeped out and good at puzzle games, I recommend the game. If you are more into being chased and always having to be on your toes, then maybe you should go look somewhere else.","December 3, 2013","true","9.5"," 40 of 49 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","40","49","0","0"

I'll tell you what happens: you get Lost Souls, the creepiest game by far in the Dark Fall series. What a game. What a finish.\n\nWhere do I even begin, since it's all great? I love the look of this game. You can tell Jonathan Boakes definitely had a bigger budget to play with since this game moves away from the Myst like feel, and more towards 360 degree surroundings, in which your character turns, sweeping the surroundings around him, instead of slide images. Time has not been kind to the Dowerton Station and Hotel. In Dark Fall 1, the train station is unsettling, but still just an empty, abandoned train station. In DF: LS, Dowerton has turned into a hell hole - a place where vandalism, illicit activity, and even satanic activity have become commonplace. The train station and hotel is beautifully rendered, yet is visually disturbing. This game does not bank on jump scares, though I was suprised a couple times. The scares come from knowing that you are exploring an evil place.\n\nThe story is fairly simple and very reminiscent of a Silent Hill kind of story. You are an Inspector who failed to apprehend the kidnapper/murderer of a young girl named Amy. She was last seen at the train station. Your guilt and shame lead you to return to the station and hopefully find her and bring about closure. As you explore, you meet other ghosts who for some reason or other are also trapped in the hotel. Because you are such a nice inspector, you help these lost souls find their way so they can move on. Each ghost you help gives you a key that will be useful. What I love about this section is that you are able to jump back in time to 1947, seeing the hotel at its peak. It makes returning to the present all the more horrifying as you see the decay of the place.\n\nJust like the previous Dark Fall games, the use of sound is great. With visuals and sound creating an eerie, disturbing world, this is a game that would definitely be one to play in the dark with a good set of headphones.\n\nSo, good basic story, good visuals and sound, what about the puzzles? They are by far the easiest puzzles in the Dark Fall series. Yes, you will still read a lot and you will need to take notes, but I feel that the puzzles are a lot more intuitive than the previous games. There are three floors to the Hotel, and each one serves as a kind of level. The Train Station itself serves as a level. Within each level, there are puzzles that are meant for just that area. To me, that makes this game a lot easier, unlike Dark Fall: The Journal where you just jump in and have no idea what the first objective is.\n\nSpeaking of learning objectives, your character has a cell phone! Throughout the game, you will receive texts that will give hints to where you should go, and the next mission. It will also serve as filling in parts of the story.\n\nThis game was a fitting conclusion to the Dark Fall series. I enjoyed revisiting the Dowerton Station and Hotel. It has really made me curious and excited to look at other games made by Jonathan Boakes. If you like ghost stories, you owe it to yourself to try the Dark Fall series.\n\n","April 3","true","10.3"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","2"

This game is a nonlinear horror that had me tense all the time and scared a lot of the time.  Though the game is nonlinear, there are some things that need done before you can move on.  Sometimes, what needs to be done is not obvious so you pretty much have to go around and try different things until you can move on.  There is a quite wonderful guide on Steam (I'm sorry I don't remember the name of the one who made it, but qudos to you).  This is definately not a game for children.  The game has two endings and several very interesting easter eggs about hauntings and weird happenings around the area of the game.  I really liked that and looked to collect them all.  Some of the mechanics of the game are a little hard to work with (like moving things), but keep trying and some of the puzzles (like "conversations with...") were downright frustrating.  All in all, even though I needed some help, I had a great time.

It is not necessary to have played the earlier games (The Journal, Lights Out) but I'm sure that once you've played Lost Souls you will want to see what else Darkling Room has to offer. This game is creepy as all hell!\n\nYou play as The Inspector - an ex police inspector who, several years before, investigated the disappearance of a young girl called Amy in the town of Dowerton. She was never found. You are back at Dowerton Railway Station and the Station Hotel, which are now in total disrepair due to them being abandoned shortly after Amy's disappearance. It is bonfire night and fireworks light up the sky above the eerie night-time setting. It soon becomes clear that some bad things have happened here. There are many lost souls - some good, some evil, lurking in the shadows. Some want to harm you but others need your help. You will be transported to times past in order to understand all the events that have taken place and to finally find your own fate. This is no ordinary place though. Jonathan Boakes, the creator, has surpassed himself in creating a world which is familiar enough to make you feel at home, yet weird enough to make it a very unsettling and scary place indeed.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=563167281\nI cannot praise Lost Souls enough. The graphics, navigation, music, sound effects, gameplay, puzzles - all are of an excellent quality and take 'point and click' adventures on to a whole new level.","November 28, 2015","true","8.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

This ghost story is something I would expect to have read out to me in some classroom by some over enthusiastic grade scholar with aspiring dreams to be the next Stephen King - except when you hear the story you realize in your heart of hearts that it's never going to happen. You play the game as an Inspector who is trying to solve the case of a young missing girl. Having tampered with the evidence to get a certain suspect convicted you find yourself out of work and desperate to solve the actual case and redeem yourself. Your investigations begin to uncover some paranormal connection and things begin to take a decidedly darker turn.\n\nGraphically the game is serviceable but the voice acting is so ear-splittingly awful I wanted to vomit every time the inspector opened his mouth to say something. This is one game you'll be wiser to just turn the volume right down. I got this on one of the sales so I don't feel cheated as I think I paid $2 but I wouldn't seriously think about going any higher than that price wise unless you are in it just for the laughs because if this was supposed to be scary or chilling or even clever it missed the mark completely.","May 3, 2014","false","11.4"," 67 of 120 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","67","120","0","2"

If Steam had the option for a middle spot between recommend and don't recommend, I'd choose it.  It had its moments, some of the puzzles were good and much of the story was okay as well, but nothing really shone.  Some confusing UI.  Some horrible voice acting (and some okay).  Some cheesy horror aspects.  No ability to skip repetitive dialog or animations.  Quite linear, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but there are some obtuse prerequisites to move the story along at times.  For instance, you're in a room, do everything you can...and move on.  Explore some other area, do all you can...then get stuck.  Well if you then go back to the first area, something will have changed for some reason...triggered by something else you did but for no apparent reason.\n\nBut overall, it just didn't grip me enough to make me want to work through things...or I would just assume something illogical was going on even if in the end it just might have just taken a little more scrutiny...but time I didn't feel like spending on it.\n\nIn the end, it was good enough that I at least was willing to finish it.  I got it on a 75% Steam sale, so I can't complain.  If you like horror/spooky and maybe have an interest in the occult, it might grip you more than it did me and you can overlook some of its flaws.","August 21, 2014","false","14.9"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

The puzzles are clever, original and solvable. There is plenty of exploration and the environments are very well rendered (granted, it takes you forever to move from place to place). The game provides a few really effective scares (only 2-3 jump scares), and a tense atmosphere. There is also enough surrealism to make any survival horror veteran uneasy.\n\nBy far, the best part of this game is the sheer amount of time you spend scissoring things. I don't think I've ever used so many pairs of scissors so many times and so consistently in an adventure game. I personally feel the scissoring makes up for most of the very bad plot devices. Completely.\n\nAll in all: Don't play for the story. Play it for the puzzles.

But before you play it on your steam, you decide to check the overall user reviews on the game and find that(at this time) this game is 'Mixed'. Half liked it and the other don't so read through it and see that you'll jsut have to find out for yourself which side of the mixed reviews you'll be on.\n\nAbout 2 hrs of playing, confusion, looking up guides, and snoring. You might find that this game is a total piece of suck from a duck with trucks mucking around in poo and that now you're on the negative side of the mixed reviews and wonder why the flippin burger gurgers that anyone even remotely likes this stupid, boring, hyptic game. I know I only played 2 hours at the time fo this review, but it's just so boring.\n\nAlright review portion; I bought this game on sale thank gerd, in hopes of having fun with a good horror mystery game. What I soon found minutes into the game IN THE FIRST AREA is that I had to look up a guide on what to do. Warning lights flashed and foreshadowed what I'll be doing later and constantly in the future of this game(Which I did).\n\nBack pedal a bit, the options in this game is unbelievably pathetic, no window mode, no audio adjust, just difficulty and subtitles.(Which on that note I might need to play the game on a lower difficulty to see if it actually plays better as it defaults to hard).\n\nAnyways the game is not clear and is never quite clear on what you can do in this game as that's how I got stuck on the first 'puzzle' because it went against everything I knew about the point n clicks I played. I'd spoil it but then you wouldn't know the frustration of finding out how this dumb game and it's mechanics work. This game has mechanics that just make everything you do a chore and makes the game unnessacarily slow and difficult by having crucial items you need at your feet out of view that you had to look down at, at specifical points. Oh and there's no 'examine area' where most point n click characters would make a comment about something like say for instance clicking on a dark area would make them say 'It's too dark here, if only I had some light to see' to give you a clue of what to do.\n\nSpeaking of voice your main character's voice causes heart attacks because it's just one of the most cringe worthy british accents I ever heard. It sounds like Pete form Disney is choking on something while trying to speak in a british voice. it's terrible and I could have done a better accent.\n\nMusic is also quite grinding to listen to as it just keep repeating itself and gets dull.\n\nI started falling asleep as I try to figure out the bizzare hyptic puzzles the game wants you to figure out and I swear they don't give you enough clear hints on how to solve them and that the creators are out of their freaking minds when making these dumb puzzles. I want Virtue's Last Reward Puzzles Quality! Not this bullcrap. You got clues that are loosely connected and then the whole somewhat pixel hunting to find items you'll need the puzzles in this game is just crap and thinking about it will just ruin another set of brain cells that could have lived longer for a better purpose. You WILL be looking at a walkthrough to find out how the fudge you're suppose to make progress because it lacks any logic at all.\n\nOh and don't get me started on the horror aspect of this game, it has creepy areas to be in but the scares themselve so far have been ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The ghost are laughable harry potter ghosts, and the scares are cheap jumpscares that are not impressive at all and didn't even wake me up as I yawned.\n\nShould have named the game Dark Fail: Lost Cause. cause I just don't want to keep playing after 2 hrs and there's 8 parts to this and fudge that noise, just go watch some poor sod playing through this game or some playthrough of some poor sod who went through it.\n\nAs if the game isn't bad enough you have the whole mixed reviews with people who actually like this game. Well more power to those but they would have to be crazy to like this maddening game. It's like the game Anna if it was slower, more hyptic, and less logic. Oh and this is obvious but never ever listen to the review scores in the trailer because they knew this game is bad and had to find some way to convince people to buy it. Believe the negative reviews not the positive ones because I'm positive they just used a guide and never thought for a second how hyptic the puzzles are and believe the game is good.\n\nThe graphics are the only thing worth praising as it looks like a location from a resident evil game and is quite nice.\n\nWhatever I paid for this game I want my money back.","May 15","false","2.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

There is a lot of puzzles and most of them are really nice, but the controls can be awkward to use and some puzzles are pretty difficult or annoying because there doesn't seem to be any clues as to what you should do. The game's story is convoluted and I don't really learn much from it, I'm not sure if this is intended so that the player can interpret things, but I was left pretty confused. The ending is also very anti-climatic, there are two endings and they are pretty much the same and they are both very cliché endings. Despite the negatives, I do recommend this game but probably not at full price. You'll like it if you like the more subtle genre of horror (Silent Hill-esque), point & click games, lots of puzzles and searching of items.

The game has interesting bonus items, so if you're interested, use a game guide, as there's no way to get clues to figure out the way to get them on your own.\nThis game has a number of jump scares, so if you're against those, I wouldn't recommend it.

While it is most similar to the first Dark Fall: The Journal in both tone and setting, with of course being a graphical leap over the original, it lacks the series and its spin off's(The Lost Crown) rich lore, notably in its lack of virtually any supporting flavor text which added so much to the series aside from scattered newspaper clippings. The other titles all had a novel's worth of extra materials that added to the stories. What's left is a point and click stumble through a rehash of the Dowerton Train Station and Hotel that we already explored long ago. And with the cumbersome method of panning and up and down, a very tedious stumble at that. Several times now I've had to check a guide on where I went wrong only to find I didn't pan up at one overly specific spot. In addition the Penumbra/Amnesia style mouse interaction with some puzzles is clunky to say the least, and not even casually hinted at. It can be quite difficult to intuit where exactly you are supposed to move the stupid mouse to get a reaction, or you find yourself clicking things to no avail only to find you were supposed to drag them to the side(spark plugs...) despite it not really making sense to do so.\n\nPutting aside these design and technical issues, the game still stands as a great little horror adventure title to play through. It is atmospheric and has a few nice jump scare scenes and a continuation of the Dark Fall storyline is always a good thing.","July 13, 2014","true","9.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The story is nice as well but the gameplay is very fuzzy. I mean, there's a lot of good ideas in this game (grabbing something with the mouse button and shaking the mouse to interact with the objects is a wonderful idea of interaction), but this game could call more attention on steam if the developer suited this point & click to a new game engine like Blender for exemple. It could be like Myst IV interaction (the players can see the scenery just moving the mouse to the corners of the screen) but with the same ideas of the dark fall's iinteraction. The other problem is: some puzzles are not well explained. I had to search on youtube about how to solve 3 or 4 puzzles, and that's not a good thing to do in a poin&click game. So my conclusion is: Dark Fall Lost Souls was a really great game in 2009, but nowdays it is just a nice game. I have 100% of sure that this game could be soo much better if the developer released a new version using a new engine.","June 7, 2015","true","22.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lumpsplays/recommended/46750/","lumpsplays","LumpsPlays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lumpsplays/","45 products in account","I wanna start out by saying I LOVE old school point and clicks, and the first 2 dark fall games were amazing to me, story, gameplay, environments, etc. They had everything I look for in an adventure game. I cannot say the same for Dark Fall: Lost Souls. It feels like they just handed the location setting to a completely random team, and said "make a ghost story!"\n\nThe story is cliche and forgettable. The first 2 titles in the series had very original, deep plotlines that I loved delving into. The lore was awesome, and traveling to different time periods was essential AND fascinating. In Lost Souls, the story is about a ghost girl that is haunting a haunted place. That's literally it. The depth of "malakai" from 2, or the intrigue of the well are completely gone from Lost Souls, and replaced with a snotty-spoiled ghost-child wearing pig tails. A huge let down.\n\nThe environments are a GREAT improvment! This game looks amazing compared to the first entries, however it's a huge shame that the improved graphics isn't met with better game design. Instead of being afraid of the story, you will be afraid of the graphics, if you're afraid at all. Something will jump on the screen, you won't find any notes in this game that give you chills to simply read. And I found that to be a huge let down.\n\nAnother thing that really bothered me was the padding. It wasn't the content that was padded, but the controls and gameplay itself. It takes a FULL SECOND to just turn your character in a single direction. This sounds negligible, but when you're trying to figure out where to go all of a sudden you realize you've been in the same hallway for nearly 2 minutes doing literally nothing but trying to orientate your character. The game (for no real reason) also allows you to "look" up/down on every single screen. Despite how this is only used once or twice in puzzles or story exploration, it's ultimately just a trap to spend MORE time looking around slowly and accomplishing nothing.\n\nI know my account shows nearly 30 hours of gameplay—I assure you that is not because I loved it OR because it's that long! I literally fell asleep multiple times playing this game. How uninteresting the story is, how much nothing seems to actually fit into anything, how slow it is to even MOVE, all add up to an incredibly dull game. The most successful thing this game did, was put me to sleep.\n\nEDIT: If you're still reading and want another example of how watered down bad this is compared to the first 2, you remember the "over here!" or "here!" voice mechanics in 1 and 2? That were creepy to hear cuz it meant something creepy was happening? In this game, when you hear "Over here!" it means "HEY TURN YOUR FLASHLIGHT ON, YOU CAN'T SEE!". That's all. It only happens when you need your flashlight out. Because not being able to see wasn't hint enough? Completely ruined a creepy mechanic.\n\nTL;DR\nAs a standalone game, it's better than most other point and clicks, but still forgettable 6/10\nAs a sequel to Dark Fall 1 & 2, it's an utter disappointment 3/10.\nJust play 1 or 2 again, is what I recommend.","May 24","false","29.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I absolutely love horror graphic adventures and I can objectively say this game is terrible.\n\nThe gameplay is very tedious, walking and turning around are slow actions, and you get stuck in the game without any signs of what you should do next very often, which wouldn't be so bad if it didn't take you years to go from point A to point B and explore it. Textures and animations lack details and make the game look older than it really is. The overall atmosphere is pretty good, but in the end the only really scary parts are just cheap scare jumps (really cheap, literally just an image appearing and the music going loud for a second).\n\nThe story reuses a lot of elements from Dark Fall: The Journal, and it's not bad, although the endings are incredibly disappointing (there are two, they only depend on a line in the final dialogue).\n\nThe worst thing about this game is the voice acting. It is AWFUL, most of the time lacking emotion or, on the contrary, sounding too forced. It kind of reminded me to the voice acting in Resident Evil 1, but I would choose RE1's any time.\n\nI bought this game 75% off and I would undo it. I wouldn't even try it if it was free.

You are a detective bent on solving the disappearance of a girl called Amy. It turns out later that this has become an obsession that has made you a bit crazy. But the main part of the game consists of exploring the old Station Hotel, which has become hideously warped and messed up since it is possessed by a creepy supernatural evil called the Dark Fall (you know this from the earlier games). There is also the ghost of the girl you are searching for and other souls trapped in the hotel that you can free.\n\nThe thing about this game is that its really really scary, so much so that I only finished it for the sake of finishing it and used the walkthrough to get it done as soon as possible. I usually love Jonathan Boakes' games who is  a master of creepy adventure games; he is one of my favourite game creators ever (especially The Lost Crown; you should totally play that if you're vaguely interested in this). Chiefly, the decor of the hotel is terrifying; aside from blood smears everywhere, the corridors are dark, there are incredibly creepy mannequins everywhere and the scissor collections still haunt me (a bed stabbed dozens of times, and a wall equally covered in scissors in the room of a doomed soul - although artsy, its just horrible).\n\nI set this game apart from Boakes' other creations because it steps over a line the others didn't cross. For one thing, there is blood, and quite a lot of it. There's still no all-out violence which is good; I think that would make me turn away from Boakes forever. But the blood is mainly just gross and indicative of brutality. There are also weird bloody writhing creatures that you have to kill with scissors which is also gross and just unpleasant.\n\nThen there is threat of actual violence being done to your player character; I have not seen this before in his games and it was horrible. I am referring to one scene in the game where a ridiculously creepy creature is cowering in the corner but moves towards you as the light flickers. You have until it reaches you to solve a little puzzle which isn't difficult but the enormity of stress that I felt made it so bad. If you fail to solve it in time the scene changes to you being defibrilatored in hospital and you have to try again.\n\nWhen I first loaded into the game the first thing I noticed which was different were the controls; you can look in for directions all around you as well as above and below each direction. You also swivel to change view rather than blocking from one frame to another. This immediately changes the way you feel about looking another way; it takes time, which builds suspense and, in my case, dread. It slows the game down considerably, especially when you find you went the wrong way or are not sure where to head next. This makes it frustrating as well. It is also hard to follow. Without the walkthrough I would have given up way earlier.\n\nAnother irritation is that you can't actually explore that much of the hotel; the number of rooms available to look in is very limited which is kindof annoying for me since I really enjoyed the freedom to enter every room in the hotel in the first game. However, since the parts of the hotel you can see are so terrifying I'm ok with not seeing more of it. I'd have just preferred a game based on mystery rather than shock and horror, like the first ones.\n\nIt wasn't all bad though; there are some scenes which transport you back in time where you have to solve some puzzles to free someone's soul. These are very nice; mainly because they remove you from the horrible deformed hotel you arrived in, and the puzzles are quite nice, although irritatingly repetitive if you get them wrong the first time. Overall however I'm going to uninstall this and pretend it never happened and hope the nightmares go away...","August 13, 2015","false","6.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

The clicking is not intuitive at all, you basically keep clicking all over the picture until something happens. I got frustrated pretty quickly and have no interest in ever playing it again.

The game has puzzles that could be solved within 3-4 hours, but because of the game interface it takes 3 times of that amount.\nYou move from one sperical scene to another. This would be fine if you could at least pan around at will. No, you can only look into each of the 4 cardinal direction and have to suffer from awful and annoying transitions after every move. Plus you can look up and down, in every direction. Now consider that most directions don't show anything interesting and any wrong move or click makes you suffer through more slow transistion, you can imagine why this game isn't fun.\nSo I decided to fast forward through the game with a walkthrough. And even with that the time you spend outside of puzzles, trying to get from place A to B take forever and are just not fun. I can't imagine how someone who needs to explore the often contrived puzzles gets through this without kicking his computer.\nIt's a waste of time.","May 29, 2014","false","7.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

You wander around aimlessly usually coming back to the same areas later in the game and you find new items there that weren't there before....how does that make any sense!

Luckily I got it at a deep discount.\n\nThe UI is clunky, voice acting mediocre, and pace slow as molasses, mainly due to the aformentioned unskippable bits and painfully slow panning to look around and move. It makes for boring gameplay, and multiple times I wandered off to get a snack or watch tv, forgetting I left the game running. Also annoying is the idiotic protagonist inspector who, after seeing many supernatural occurances seems to be in deep denial.\n\nIts strengths, meanwhile, are the detailed graphics, music, and sound effects.","December 18, 2015","false","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The atmosphere and the general vibe was pretty creepy, but with that said, this one seems to be even creepier. I've just started playing it, and from the start it seems like it's going to be an extremely difficult game. I like puzzles even though I'm not very good at them, so I'll probably have to consult a walkthrough, which is somethih8ng I rarely had to do with the others.\n\nThe way the camera moves is interesting, as it's very different from the other games in the series. I think it moves a bit too slow sometimes, but it's a minor annoyance. It sets for the eerie atmosphere I suppose. As for the other mechanics, like it's been said in other reviews, it's a bit difficult to grasp the 'move the objects' mechanic. I found myself throwing my mouse in every direction to figure out how to move something, but once again, it's a really minor annoyance.\n\nAll said so far, I like the game from what I've played of it. It genuinely creeped me out (I'm playing this before bed, joy), and I'm really excited to see more of the story unfold. Would definitely recommmend this to anyone who likes to get creeped out!","February 17","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dark Fall: Lost Souls is... odd, to say the least, but it has a certain charm once you overcome its counterintuitive puzzles and embrace its world's dark peculiarity.\n\nDark Fall: Lost Souls dumps you in media res in a dark train tunnel full of detritus, apparently investigating the disappearance of a local girl that's been pinned on another local, unsavory character. Right from the get go, the puzzles in Lost Souls are incredibly obtuse, and are often more easily solved by just clicking everything and hoping something works rather than trying to apply any sort of logic to things. Step 1: collect any items. Step 2: Slam said items against everything and any other items in your inventory until something clicks. Step 3: If you're still buggered, maybe actually pay attention the lore-related bits.\n\nThat's something of an oversimplification, but you're likely to get frustrated on a regular basis if you think anything about this game is going to be straightforward. Bring some paper along with you in real life, take notes (especially if you see symbols involved in something), and keep an eye on the cursor at all times for any changes as you hover over things. Even then, there's likely to be trial and error involved.\n\nDespite all this hardship, the story of Dark Fall: Lost Souls is interesting enough to stick with it and get through to the end. If you can, track down the other two Dark Fall games, or at least the first one, Dark Fall: The Journal. The Journal takes place in the same location as Lost Souls, so you can see what led to Lost Souls' events and get a bit more context. Dark Fall: Lights Out, the second game in the series, is a bit of a departure and is set elsewhere, but at least shares similar logic and is tied in tangentially to the other two.\n\nMy recommendation on this one is a bit tenuous and comes with caveats, but I liked it overall. If you feel the whole taking notes thing is a bit too much work, maybe pass on this one.","January 8","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
