I can't recommend it to general/casual players, because it is so harsh, unfriendly and unforgiving. But I can recommend it to people looking for a real challenge, who won't mind looking for information on the Internet and dealing with frustrating game features (which are most of them).\n\nThe core mechanic of this game (a brawler fight with flying machines and attached weapons) is loads of fun. It's a fresh original concept and it is done perfectly. Different weapons have _very_ different characteristics, every each one feels different, and there is extreme attention to detail. Basically, every pixel matters - if you hit your enemy with the tip of your sword has a completely different effect than if you hit it with your blade (and how much you slash him) or the hilt. Every weapon has different weight, different sharpness, it's harder or easier to manage. Blades are very good againt skin, but it's difficult to penetrate armor with them. This is a paradise for someone enjoying exactly this - different weapon/armor combinations and their interactions.\n\nThe game is based purely on skill. It's extremely hard to master and there are so many details you wouldn't even think of (until you read web guides). You'll die all the time, and repeat, repeat, repeat. But once you become good at it, the battles are so enjoyable. They are still very hard - you haven't dodged a flying debris? Half dead. You haven't dodged or deflected a sword thrust? Dead. But you'll start seeing the details and be able to react better; it won't be just a chaos on screen. And then it starts to be a real fun.\n\nUnfortunately, as much as the battle mechanics are awesome, the rest of the game implementation is awful. Weapon selection is bad, weapon market is bad, game UI is especially tragic, a lot of features are not explained at all, there is a lot of bugs, often you have no idea why you died, enemies are frequently off-screen but still can attack you, allies often perform actions that hurt you (like shooting or throwing bombs your way), .... I could go on and on. You'll grind your teeth every time you have to deal with this or you make some mistake that can't be reversed (like imbuing your weapon with a gem during the battle because of clicking a mouse button in the wrong time - what a great feature).\n\nIf you want to play this game, here are some tips:\n* http://wikicheats.gametrailers.com/Hammerfight_-_PC\n* http://hubpages.com/search/Hammerfight\n* http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2035787\n* in order to reduce graphical clutter on the screen, set quality to 0.2 in game and also edit Config.ini and set GFX_RENDER_* to 'false'\n* you can switch full-screen with alt+tab and you can release/grab your mouse cursor with ctrl+g\n","December 19, 2013","true","12.9"," 151 of 182 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","151","182","0","0"

I've read a lot of useless reviews about this game, and most of them contain misleading or just plain wrong information. I've played this game an insane amount (the number you see is only a fraction), so I feel like I should try to set the record straight.\n\nIf you have a mouse with adjustable DPI, put it as high as it will go. Put the in-game DPI at 100. If you still can't move around easily, buy a new mouse, because yours is horrible. You want a mouse with at least 800 DPI, which shouldn't be difficult to find. Pretty much any ♥♥♥♥♥♥ wireless mouse now days has that.\n\nI'm not going to give this game an across the board recommendation. It's full of perplexing design choices: Really hard at the beginning, need 2 mice to trade items between profiles, can't un-equip gems without editing the game files, gem farming is really tedious,(just edit them, it's not worth farming), can't manually select levels in the arena, runs at 50 fps (why?), need to play through multiple times to unlock every game mode and weapon, and the giant hud gets in the way a lot because the game is locked at 800x600.\n\nThat being said, POWER THROUGH THE FIRST LEVEL WITH THE flying insects. Yes, it's hard. It's hard because you suck. It gets easier after that, and even easier once you actually learn how to control your momentum and spacing properly. Controlling the flying thing while wielding a weapon is weird at first, but once you get the hang of it, it works incredibly well, and the game has a ridiculous amount of depth. I'm still learning new techniques after over 100 hours in.\n\nAs for miscellaneous stuff you should probably know: Once you put a gem on a weapon, you can't take it off. You have to edit the gem away. There are plenty of guides on how to do that. Blood rubies are essential for arena (the best part of the game by far), and they are very difficult to get. I'd recommend not farming them and just editing them onto your weapons once you finish the main story.\n\nThis is one of the most unique and most satisfying games I have ever played, but it takes some time to actually learn how to play well. Give it 4 or 5 hours. If you can tolerate it that long but still aren't having fun, give it until you start doing arena fights. If you still don't like it, then I guess it's not for you.","October 23, 2014","true","52.6"," 64 of 70 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","64","70","0","1"

However, while the concept is pretty cool, the actual game leaves a LOT to be desired; the menus, UI, controls, story, objectives and general game format are horribly confusing, the resolution is poor and the game is unfairly difficult. Often you'll die very suddenly after being stunned and rammed into a wall, and there's so much happening on screen that even when you can control your machine it's easy to lose track of what's going on. In spite of this, I enjoyed it for the most part, but a less determined gamer may quickly lose interest or quit from frustration.","December 25, 2013","false","9.4"," 189 of 292 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","189","292","0","0"

The secret is in the physical skill you need to develop to succeed as a young aristocrat, defending his world from all kinds of airborn dangers. Sitting in an iron barrel you energetically move your mouse in spirals to aquire hitting impulse on the dongle and crash smth ('Mount Your Friends' veterans should feel familiar). The physics model is allright and you soon get to feel the weapon almost like a real object.

There is more - a few minigames, arenas, weapon socketing and even weapon combinations.

Because it's sooooooooooo good, if a little short (and lacking in multiplayer co-op, i'd love to go on a hunt with me and 2 other friends, swishing our better-than diamond swords around ;-;). The armoury is a huge assortment of mostly unique weapons each with a potentially unique fighting style.\nThe weapons are divided up in to 5 main categorys: swords, maces, flails, guns and axes, *note: there are a few other things that don't exactly fit in to any of the categories and also a fair few misc usables and things* flails have chains and can deal a massive impact on a direct blow, the chains are normally a fair amount longer than the other weapons, and therefore have more reach, the swords seem to be a little weak as they can not deal a huge stunning crush like the axes and maces and flails, but still have a greater balance which makes it easier to aim when coupled with guns, oh and i forgot to mention, you can combine any 2 weapons together to make a combo weapon thing, quite fun! There are not too many guns (There are 5 guns to be precise) and it's not easy to just use them as they are, they have an infinite amount of ammo, but the reloads are long and tend to have only 5-20 ammo cap. They are unfortunately over powered when in the AI's hands as they seem to have aim-hacks and a much faster cooldown etc. The axes are sort of a combo between maces and swords, and can deal a crushing blow like the mace, whilst still capable of the alacrity contained by the sword. The maces are a great way to start of your learning, easy to handle and deal a crushing hit, but not so useful late-game.\nThere are also "singing stones" in the games which are gems, there are in total 5 different kinds of gems (i think) and 2 different sizes of each, the bigger ones being more powerful. The gems can be slotted in to slots in your weapons to have valuable effects. The emeralds add a wraith effect which when the click button is pressed with the weapon you can go invulnerable for 1 second or so (and also unable to attack), the topaz sets things the weapons hit on fire, the ruby heals battle wounds when it deals dmg, the purple gem (I forget the name) has lightning damage, not particularly sure how it works, but i think it's something to do with coming in to contact with metal... The blue one (idk either) freezes things it attacks, which doesn't really seem to do much, but i think it slows the enemy down...\nThere seems to be a 4 special weapons that you can obtain in the story line and through hammerball. 2 are swords, 1 is an axe, and the other is a hammer. None of them seem to be particularly special, other than looking fancy.\n\nThere are 5 game modes (they like the number 5 don't they!) You have to unlock each one as you go through the story line, the first one is "solo" QED the story line. The 2nd one is the "hall". The armoury is there too and a few practice dummies. The 3rd is the arena, it's where you go to make your name and rise through the ranks so you can make a very long dangling piece of wool hang from your airship thingy. The arena slowly get's harder and more challenging as the game goes on, it would be so much easier if I wasn't crying evry tim i accidentally mash one of the enemy airships in to the floor and have them explode in my face (it is possible to have them surrender when you do enough damage and disarm them and stuff), the third is "grim" or the hunting challenge, it's sort of a survival, there are always 4 rounds (i think) every game, and every 4th round has a final boss that is shown above spewing poison and throwing tentacles around. The other 3 have a load of floating worms, kamikaze bees, and angry floating lobsters. The final round isn't much fun after the first try... It's called hammerball and you have 2 teams, you and a few robot lobsters, they fly around trying to get the ball in to your hoop and you fly around trying to get the ball in to theirs, if you win 3 rounds you get given a posh looking hammer to mash people with.\n\nThe good stuff:\n> Wonderful fighting mechanics\n> Fun story line\n> Completely unique game (i think)\n> Has hilarious moments (A requisite for all good games)\n> I think (that is i haven't got to the end yet, but i have gotten quite far...) that the challenge game-modes, are endless and slowly get harder every time you win.\n\nThe bad stuff:\n> Short story line\n> The story line ends up in the same place no matter what you choose...\n> Some of the weapons are unobtainable depending on how you choose the story lines\n> Evil AI (perhaps a nerf of the stunning and 2 hit killing tri-cannon things...)\n> Judging. (They have morals ;-;)\n\nHow to make it much much much better:\n> Add custom made weapons!!!!\n> Co-op (hunt) +PvP! (arena)\n> A no-morales mode where you don't get hated when you accidentally throw your gigantic flail at someone;-;\n> Add in other ways of healing other than buying healing pots and the blood gem!

Landing one of those perfect hits on the enemy, going blue, and just generally destroying everything is one of the most satisfying things in this game.\n\nGFX - The attention to detail is superb, as seen in the environments, weapons, and "vehicles."\n\nStory - While difficult to understand at times, I enjoyed it a lot, and though it interesting.\n\nWeapons - There are a great many weapons available, and each is different.\n\nModes - There are 5 working gametypes: Solo: single player campaign, Hall: where you select and buy weapons, Grim: where you hunt flying worms, Arena: where you fight other flying machines, Hammerball: where you fight weird machines in some sort of soccer type game.\n\nThere is another gametype called Tribal Wars, but it doesn't seem to work (at least, for me).\n\nCons:\nSMASH! - Sometimes, if you go blue and miss an enemy, you might wind up outside the map.\n\nGFX - People are really weird sometimes. The animations can be... odd.\n\nStory - Lost in translation applies here. Quite a bit of it.\n\nWeapons - Sometimes the chain type weapons will break. No idea under what circumstances, and it doesn't happen terribly often.\n\nModes - Solo: The story can be very confusing and jumps somewhat. Hall:sometimes weapons can be lost if you drop them, Grim: the idiot AI enjoy dropping bombs on your head all the time, Arena: it often pits you against 3 AI at a time, and that can make it extremely difficult at times, Hammerball: Not for the faint of heart, this is the single most difficult challenge I have EVER faced in a game. More on that later.\n\nAs I mentioned, Tribal Wars seems to not work at all for me.\n\nOn the subject of Hammerball: For the first round, you have to face a single flying mechanical lobster. Not too difficult. Second round, you have to face two. One goes for the ball while the other uses some sort of taser on you if you don't dodge it. Third round you have to face three flying mechanical flying lobsters. One goes after the ball and the other two attack you with some sort of taser.\n\nThere are 4 different ball types I have encountered in Hammerball. The first, a rock, is easy to deal with and gives you one point per score. The second is a bomb that will go off after a time unless the game ends, or you manage to score. It's worth two points. The third is a flying buzzsaw that will get angry if you hit it, and it will move around. It's somewhat manageable and is worth three points. The fourth is some sort of flying tentacle monster that will generally kill you when it appears. I would assume it's worth four points if it's actually possibly to push into the goal. Bit of a spoiler here: it looks like the final boss of the game, but can fly around.\n\nOn the subject of AI: In general, they aren't too bad. Your allies like to throw bombs though, and sometimes, the human AI like to seriously "derp out."\n\n\nOverall, I think that, even with all it's flaws, it is a GREAT game. It's incredibly fun to smash the AI with hammers, flails, axes, swords, etc. The graphics are amazing, and the AI can be dealt with. For only $5 I think it's a great game, and has entertained me for hours on end.","July 21, 2014","true","24.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glenmack/recommended/41100/","glenmack","Mack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glenmack/","81 products in account","TLDR: Good concept, bad implementation.\n\nHammerfight tests your skill at flying a steampunk helicopter (best description I can think of for someone who hasn't actually seen one), which seems to be refered to as a "machine" while attatched to various devices of war which you swing via the momentum imparted by moving your machine. You use this as a weapon in combat aginst whoever is thrown at you.\n\nThis review centres around mouse contol as it is the only control in the game.\n\nNote: I played the opening chapter of this game while it was free on Steam which was as far as I could before it became thoroughly frustrating. Not due to the game being hard, but because of the many initial obstacles are due to implementation.\n\nOnce calibrated, my mouse (Logitech G5 gaming mouse) was able to give me a distinct and measurable feel in moving the machine around, which is great, the initial close quarters fight felt intense and I felt like I had good distinct control over the momentum of my weapon.\n\nThat sounds like great implementation. What's wrong with it?\n\nAs I progressed through the chapter, I was pitted against more and more foes simultaneously, on progressively larger battlefields. My high precision movements covered a tiny area, and with no other controls than the mouse, I found myself pounding my desk with my mouse as I pick it up to move it back to a comfortable position.\n\nWhy not recalibrate your mouse?\n\nOkay, So I started again, manually calibrated the mouse to give me greater freedom of movement.\n\nPanned in the first fight. Why? That smooth distinct control over the momentum of my machine had gone. But I could move around at pace. A few calibrations later, I still couldn't find an acceptable balance between pace, control and not having to pick the mouse up every time I want to move.\n\nWhich brings me to the enemies knockback. When an enemy stikes you, you go flying, not surprising at all, and not a huge problem in game, but you guessed it, you're gonna have to move the mouse if you want to get out of that corner (the sky has corners right? I'll get back to this in a minute.) and this simply added to the wrist flicking madness.\n\nMaybe your setup is poor? Do you have a tiny desk?\n\nNope. I have two 23inch widescreens, wih room for a third if I really wanted it and the entire width of the 2nd monitor is where my mouse lies.\n\nSomething just occured to me, time to Google.\n\nI'm amazed, this game is NOT a port of a touchscreen tablet title. Which seems absurd, as it occurs to me a touchscreen would be a perfect control method for this type of singe control game.\n\nEnough with the controls, what's the rest of the game like?\n\nVisually, I like it, the menus are crisp, the setting seems familiar yet unique, (Think Tatooine, but with apparent unlimited access to trees.) The inspiration for the characterisation seems middle-eastern, and the ideas of fame glory being important seem to fit well. The opening does not seem to do justice to the potential of the game, with the first three fights contested in or near grey mountainous regions, and with the grey brown machines, you can easily lose both yourself and your enemies.\n\nMechanically, it CAN be good and fun, but I would say only as fun as conkers. (for those of you who didn't grow up in England, we put large seeds on the end of a length of string and take turns bashing them against each other until one breaks.) However, getting back to an earlier point, having the near infinite expanse of the sky to fight in, hitting "the edge" is terrible for a sense of immersion.\n\nProbably not worth your time, as of 7th May 2014.","May 7, 2014","false","0.8"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Unfortunately, there are a few things left to be desired.\n\nThe controls are a bit wonky, since you steer and attack by moving the mouse (attacking involves moving the mouse in a circular motion). This normally leads the mouse running off of the mouse pad, and I find myself picking up the mouse and moving it back to the center of it often. Trying to use the mouse without a pad does not really improve the situation, either, since I still find myself moving the mouse back to a more comfortable position. Also, with the move/attack controls being the movement of the mouse, positioning of the character is difficult. You can concentrate really hard on moving while having your mouse go in a circular motion, move simply in the circular motion and hope that your opponent comes close enough to get hit in the right spot, or move to where you need to be and risk getting hit before you can get your hammer/weapon to move again. I wish there was a way to make this unsusal control style work in a frustration-free manner. Maybe it's just me since I haven't played it much, but I find it hard to get into it when there is already so much trouble just to move.\n\nI can't say much about the story of the game, honestly, but I did not find the dialogue that interesting. That wasn't really what I was looking for with this game anyway, though, so I'm not going to complain about it. Just don't go into this game yourself looking for some good reading.\n\nI'll probably give this game a second chance at some point down the line, but for now, it is taking up space on my HDD, and that needs to change.","January 1, 2014","false","0.3"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","21","40","0","1"

Using momentum as your primary weapon you will find yourself swinging the mouse in circles and making motions to crush your opponents with blunt weapons, or making refined slower movements to slice with bladed weapons, which will do more damage if the target is grazed by them rather than struck down. Also you will have at your disposition: Guns, mortars, poisons, explosives, throwing weapons and shields to make for all sorts of different combat styles. Additionally you can unlock gems that give you life steal, fire damage etc. if you embed them into your weapon. The game also features different game modes in which to play which you will have to unlock first.\nIn regards to graphics Hammerfight might seem a bit pixely at times but some of the scenery is breathtaking and the others are perfectly fine.\nAs much as I love this game the beginning of it has some grueling parts to it that I wish they had fixed to be less so. You will fight something called a Sophit, a flying creature. The Sophit can be tricked and defeated but will take you a few tries and will be your first true test. There is also a siege that quickly becomes a survival scenario as you repel enemy forces and those have the best hammer style weapon in the game TIP: Get that hammer! Its a rust red hammer and you will find it quite useful. To get it defeat one of the enemies then go to the weapon and hold down space.\nBut heres the deal -> you can SKIP levels with an item you can buy if you have died a lot, so you might want to do that a few times until you have gotten the hang of things.\nThe story of the game can lose you at some points but it is fun to follow.\nAll in all I can understand why people would not like the game as it has 0 mercy on people not willing to put at least  a LITTLE time and practice into it. Game won't hold your hand thats for sure but once you get the hang of it you will have a ton of fun swinging heavy maces with crushing force, watching is slo-mo (literally the game will go slo-mo if you land a REALLY good hit) as your opponent slump to the ground in their little helicopters or downright shatter to pieces.","February 3, 2015","true","32.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It doesn't matter that it's just singleplayer and local MP (and boy, this game could sure use network MP), Hammerfight somehow made me play over and over.\n\nIn Hammerfight, you pilot a tiny helicopter that can have weapons hanging out from it. Swords, axes, flails, hammers, even guns later on. To use the weapons, however, you usually don't use buttons. You need to move yourself in order to make the weapons swing and hit your enemy. You start out in a campaign mode with an interesting and mysterious story about an original world and unlock new modes depending on your progress and decisions in the story with multiple endings.\n\nThe sortiment of weapons is vast and even different weapons of a same type offer quite a variability. As if that is not enough, you can also socket them with gems with powerful abilites, such as elemental enchantments, heal on hit and even temporary ghost form that makes you pass through enemies and ignore damage. Other equipment includes throwable weapons, shield plates that are normally hanging too until you hold a button, when they equally spread and hold, making a turtle. Speaking of which, these weapons can be activated handily, by holding LMB, you can press any key that is defined as that item's shortcut, which is great and makes you more efficient.\n\nThe feel I get from the game is both satisfying and frustrating. It feels awesome to swing your hammer, sending your enemy into ground, blowing him up by the impact. When I pair two weapons together, forming a staff that stretches to both sides out of your copter, it actually looks graceful and deadly and it's a kind of a challenge as it requires different handling. This game is a challenge from start to end for players of any level of experience. But it's an experience not worth missing.\n\nThe developer has abandoned the game and this is probably the last version you will ever see. Too bad. It deserves a sequel to an amazing story, or a prequel to enlighten us to the origins of the world, or networking to play on LAN or Online. Also, quite certainly, there are bugs. So the game can sometimes play on your nerves, but if you ask me, you'll keep coming back. It's too fun to miss.","February 20, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But once you start to understand its unique combat system and appreciate its interesting setting and aesthetic all of the initial rage you might have felt for the game goes away. There are tons of different weapons, each with their own feel and heft to them. Because of this, you will be able to create your own fighting style and strategies, yet never feel stuck in one mode of combat. A very fun game and worth playing.\n\nMake sure to own a good mouse for this game (all controls are done with moving the mouse) and despite the game's urging, do small, gentle circles with your mouse during the calibration. It makes the game much more enjoyable and saves you from needing an enourmous mousing surface to play it.\n\nI got this as part of the Humble Indie Bundle 4 and I have played it the most out of all of those great games.

The HUD is stylized to the point that you can't read it at a glance. There's too much story.

(expect to die screen 1..in fact.. screen 1 is difficult)\nIts confusing and honestly frustratingly hard to control the vehicles.\n\nAll weapons act similar even though they all feel unique.

It's a very well thought-out idea with excellent game mechanics but there's just too many flaws I have ran into recently. I'll lay out a list for convenience before I ran into problems:\n\n--- Pros ---\n. Gameplay can be very fun at times, comboing enemies and smashing them around the map is a blast\n. Arena is best part of the game, it is basically an endless stream of combat\n. The physics in this game generally run fine in-game (different story during cinematic scenes)\n. Lots of replay value due to the arena and collection of gems\n. If you missed gems during the story, there's a mode that lets you harvest gems by fighting a boss worm\n--- Cons ---\n. UI takes up a very large portion of the screen, much more than necessary\n. Resolution ratio is locked at 4:3 meaning there is no widescreen support (16:10/16:9)\n. Local Multiplayer support (dual mouse) does not work on most machines\n. Can not replay older missions unless you go through the entire storyline again\n. The boss worm game mode is very unreliable and often times the boss will break\n\nUnder these circumstances, I'd generally recommend the game as long as you can get past the UI and resolution issues. However, though I am running the same OS (w7) and hardware, I am running into problems I did not have before. The story mode is completely broken; often times physics will behave unexpectedly and events will not occur as they should, making some cinematic scenes halt indefinitely. Furthermore, a lot of important NPCs such as the blimp will seemingly kill itself due to physics discrepencies as well. This makes the game completely unplayeable as not only is it impossible to skip broken cinematic scenes, but certain important NPCs will instantly die the moment the mission starts making it impossible to complete the mission.\nAlso unfortunately, you can not access the arena until after you've gotten pretty far in the game, making the only fun part of this game (the arena) innaccessible. I'm aware of a plethora of other bugs all related to the physics, and I can only think the problem is worse with newer machines running newer operating systems. All these physics, UI and resolution problems I have with the game could be fixed with some patches, but unfortunately the developer "has gone missing". We have no idea where the developer has went, but it seems s/he has abandoned the game (and the site and all other related products) not long after the initial launch of the game, basically letting the game die as the code goes unmaintained. Normally you shouldn't have such problems in any program, but in such a physics-heavy game you are going to run into problems with newer machines running newer architectures with newer drivers etc etc.\n\nTherefore, I can not recommend this game to anyone as there's a good chance you'll run into game-halting problems. If you do plan on getting it, make sure to set your in-game mouse calibration to something like 300 as it improves movement immensely.","November 30, 2015","false","17.5"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

Perhaps my mouse is not of the quality required to properly play this game, but I found it very unresponsive to my movements and incredibly hard to control my rider. I'd adjust sensitivity... but I didn't find settings with which to do so.\n\nVisually it's alright. The resolution options are poor and it looks unpolished, with HUD information that is undefined and not easy to make sense out of at first glance.\n\nThe menus are not easy to navigate. I found them slow and convoluted.\n\nThe story seems dry and not very enthralling. I was quickly bored with what was happening and not interested in who my character was supposed to be. I blame this partially on the frustrating gameplay.\n\nThe audio was nothing noteworthy. I'm sure someone worked hard on the soundtrack (as well as the rest of the game) but the audio is just nothing special.\n\nI would like to give this game a second chance.

I wouldn't mind this so much...\n\nBUT.\n\nThe controls. WHYYYY??!?!?! Really. The tutorial, yes, is playable. Barely. But in order to get any semblance of motion out of my machine, I have to move my mouse in a 12" circle, which is just about the limit of my mousepad. Also, at the speed you're doing it, you're going to be dropping the mouse off the desk, cursing, and just about screaming at the game. Increase the mouse speed to the the maximum? Marginally better, but not by much. You still need to move the mouse a ridiculous amount, and the frequency of the spins required to do any damage to your enemies is ridiculous, to the point of being RSI-inducing. Not to mention, at that mouse setting, it's a mission in itself to click anything in the menu.\n\nI would like it, if the controls were revamped. But otherwise... No. Just no.\n\nDo your hands a favor. Y'know, unless you've used some bluetooth software to hook a Wiimote up to your PC. Then it might be fun.","January 6, 2014","false","0.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

One thing I've also noted about this paticular game is that the scripting it uses is very bad, As well as the actual coding itself. While the artistic style matches the theme of the game, And doesn't look to bad, I'd have to say that the ammount of bugs it has makes the game damn near unplayable. Now, I'm all for a game being challanging, And infact I do love challanging games, But this is more of a challange because of its floaty controlls and as I've said before, Bad coding.\n\nOne paticular moment was at the start of part III - I, Where the worm-caravan-thing would quite litterally, Bash its own head in off screen, And crash into the ground, Leaving me stuck in an endless cutscene. When I restarted it, I was greeted to the same thing, Over and over. In the end, By shear luck, I got the second phase of the cutscene to initalize and actually FAILED, Where I was able to use their built in level skipping mechanic at the cost of all gold I had earned upto that point. Not only was this rather rage endusing, But made me feel like I was being punished by the game for simply playing it.\n\nOn another note, The game engine feels very floaty in physics. One thing is the lacking of a real feeling of gravity to the world and the feeling of too much air resistance. This makes it very hard to quickly change directions as the rock-chain wouldn't switch directions dispite me yanking it the other way and swinging it that direction several times.\n\nYet another issue with the game is its overwhelming difficulty. Dispite the floaty and bad controlls, The AI seems to have damn near full controll of how they swing their weapons. While I have to pitch, Roll, Slam into walls and the floor to pull of my many orbits to get my weapon to actually swing, (Wimpily I might add.) The AI was able to dead-on charge me and send me flying into the ground, Dealing almost 50-60 damage to my starting vessel, Which is almost 80% damage. Another thing is that on MANY occations, While fighting enemies like the worm-like creatures, After bashing them in the head, They would go limp for only around a quarter of a second before shooting at me like they were fired out of a cannon, And deal a killing blow or damn near.\n\nTo cap this off, I just have to bring up the broken coding one more time. On the mission where you battle a... sky-shrimp-thing?... and defend another... Worm-blimp-thing....? ....While I would try my best to defend it, The sky-shrimp would just crash into the worm-blimp-thing and spaz out, Causing everyone to, In a way, Explode. Honestly, I tried the mission again and stood completely still while it crashed into me, And amazingly won... In under 10 seconds...\n\nOne thing I also didn't note above is the HUD. The HUD is far to big for some missions as I can't see the entire battlefield. Of corse, this issue could be just my monitor's res, But I've read that it is a big issue for others as well as myself. Of corse, The HUD issue isn't as much a problem as most other things that could be wrong about this game.\n\nWhile I understand that I probably can't do better then this, I also feel that the creators could do so much better. They put a lot of work into this, And while the consept would be great, The actual game itself was executed rather poorly. I would NOT recommend this game, Unless it was free... Which its not, And never will be. To the Devs of this game, I would STRONGLY advice a revision of the games engine and a quick once over of the scripting and dialog of cutscenes throughout the story.\n\nAnd thank you in advance for reading my review completely.  ~<3 Violet.","May 7, 2014","false","1.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

To give you some idea how unique this is, your wrist will probably get uncomfortabe because it's so unlike anything else that uses a mouse that you won't be used to it.\n\nI consider this to be an important indie classic that everyone should try playing, and fortunately you don't even have to pay to try it.

But after I got comfortable navigating the cramped levels while trying to fling whatever useless weapon you are cursed with, the controls seem as glitchy and unreliable as do the physics feel artificially handicapped or simply buggy.\n\nThe idea of flying around and crushing things with huge rocks or hammers is great, but the only thing you get to destroy in this game are your expectations and stuff right next to your mouse.\n\nAs unfinished, glitchy, unnecessarily random and hideous this game is, I can't believe this game is not early access. In it's current state, I personally can not recommend anyone should buy this game without trying it out first.\n\nWho knows, maybe you'll want to like it bad enough to actually fool yourself into enjoying it.","May 7, 2014","false","16.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While the mechanics are there, and are very fresh and unique compared to contemporary games, with the generic, copy-pasted storyline and mind-rendingly poor level design, this game was just plain difficult to enjoy. Every level in which I had played had some sort of auto-loss subquest that was nearly a toss-up success. Either it was protect the dude, protect the dude, or the brand new, top-of-the-line, franchise-defining protect the dude quest, all of which had about a 70% chance of failing regardless of your game strategy. The controls are very unique, but overall awkward and have a steep learning curve that the game does not offer time to develop. The creators of the game also spent so much time and effort trying to make the game appear old or indie-retro, the overall experience was damaged. It did support the arcade style of gameplay, but just seemed too pushed.\n\nI expected a lot from this game; I was honestly impressed by the new and unique style of gameplay, but was quite heavily let down by this flawed product. Hammerfight gets an overall 3/10 from me.","May 7, 2014","false","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can outmaneuver some of them, but after defeating 7 enemies, 2-3 at once (!) and still more and more come, you just can't win anymore.\n\nThe same goes for a soccer like ball game mode. At some point you have to play 1v3...\n\nAnother mode is the hunt. That one is pretty cool you even have some allies in this one. But only until late game. Because at that point your allies will become your worst foes. They use highly explosive weapons wich can catapult you towards a stone wall and immobilize you while hordes of alien insects tear you to pieces.\n\nI like games with a good challenge, but not games that try to do that with plain rough unfairness and stupidity.\n\nVery high frustration level. The devs expect you to devote your entire life to this and play 12 hours a day to be able to finish it some day in the distant future.\n\nSticking a pine cone up your ♥♥♥♥ will give you the same expierience at no cost.\n\n0/10","March 30, 2015","false","16.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecoolstarsabove/recommended/41100/","thecoolstarsabove","Petra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecoolstarsabove/","210 products in account","One of the worst games I've ever had to play in my entire life.\n\nThe whole premise of swinging around a mace, hammer, ball in a circular motion to smash enemies seems like a great premise for an indie title. However, it's executed so terribly that they might've well not tried. When you swing your hammer or ball around, it feels sluggish and incredibly slow, and not powerful in the slightest. You'd think that this could be fixed with sensitivity settings, but no, if you try to crank it up, your weapon spazzes out and cannot even complete a full circle. Your character, which is a ship that swings this weapon around, also moves like a escaped gorilla that's just been shot with four tranquilizer darts. Sometimes it moves too fast or too slow, but never at the speed you want it to.\n\nOne of the other biggest flaws about the game is its difficulty. I'm usually the last person to complain about if a game is too hard or not, but this game went way too overboard. The difficulty is straight up unfair and heavily biased to the unfortunately dimwitted AI. They can nudge you for a good chunk of your health while not even swinging their weapon around, but if you try to do it, they take no damage and instead, you get hurt. Don't even get me started on how the AI, usually allies in a fight, love to just shout random phrases and one-liners in the middle of combat with these giant dialogue bubbles that obscure the combat. I've died on several occasions because of this horrible idea, where the developers felt the need for these poorly-rendered faces to say stupid phrases while the enemy sneaks underneath the dialogue bubble to get a cheap shot.\n\nSpeaking of poorly-rendered, the graphics are atrocious. Particle effects like smoke and sparks, dramatic red flashes that block the screen if you get hit for like 5% of your health, and just noisy textures makes it extremely difficult to see what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on. It's bad enough when you can barely make out what's happening on the screen, but this is one of the few times a game has actually made me think I was controlling a different unit than my own, which ends up in me getting killed. It's quite depressing when the original Fallout games had better visuals with the same sort of graphical style, especially when it came out 12 years before this game did.\n\nAnd sadly, unlike Fallout, the story is virtually non-existant and very two-dimensional. It's a standard "big evil empire comes in to crush our native, peaceful way of life" story, with no attempt on trying to give it life or make it feel like you're invested into it. Sometimes, bad gameplay can be set aside for a good story, but the plot here is nowhere near decent and even if it was, I'd probably still wouldn't want to play through the awful controls and cluttered mess that Hammerfight is.\n\nI played through the whole game thinking it would eventually get better.\n\nIt didn't. So, for the sake of your sanity, stay away from this game at all costs. The fact that this game costs $10 by default is a joke as it is. I paid four cents for a pack with the Humble Indie Bundle a good while ago, and I still feel cheated out of my money.","November 30, 2013","false","1.1"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","7"

The mechanics were refreshingly unusual, but not horribly complex, the violence level was just right to be cathartic and amusing, and it was (at first) challenging enough to be fun without having being utterly impossible. Sure, there were levels that took several repeat attempts to get past, but it was always possible to see that you _could_ succeed, if only you'd managed a better hit at first, or dodged a little more skillfully, or not hesitated so long in that one spot, etc. It got more difficult as I progressed, of course, but not so much so that my skill level couldn't progress enough to keep up with it, if I gave it enough tries. And then.....\n\nThen I hit a level where I ended up dead in a pit somewhere. I won't give away the plot by saying how (and to be honest, I didn't pay that much attention to plot, other than to note that, surprisingly for this sort of game, it actually had one), but the only way out was to grab a disgarded weapon and fight several respawning guards. At which point the skill curve became a skill cliff... a skill cliff coated in ice filled with caves full of yetis armed with grenade launchers, while I didn't have so much as a rope. I spent an entire day trying to get past that single level, and I have no idea if I even came close. Three out of every five attempts ended before I even managed to pick up the stupid hammer. I enjoy a good challenge, but to go from levels that were challenging but possible to achieve in, at most, two or three repeats to something that a full day of cursing, teeth-grinding toil couldn't conquer isn't so much challenging as it is frustrating... and, of course, due to the game's linear nature, it makes it impossible to continue the game.\n\nI played this game during the free preview period here on Steam, and had fully intended to buy it. If I had not reached that level during the hours I played for free, I would have bought it, happily, and been exceedingly disappointed. So, sadly,  I cannot recommeend this game unless you either believe yourself to be the ultimate god of arcade games, or you enjoy an exercise in frustration. I really wish I could.\n\n~Velvet Wood","June 19, 2014","false","10.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Overall, it was an enjoyable, albeit frustrating, experience to beat the game. I spent 5 hours to beat my first playthrough and finished it again in under 3 hours.\n\nThere is a steep learning curve in the game, requiring you to be very in touch with your movement and each weapon, as each weapon is balanced differently and has different amounts of damage.\n\nThere are four types of weapons in the game and they all behave differently: Swords, Axes, Maces (Actually flails), and Hammers.\n\nSwords are best used as a slashing weapon, obviously. The best damage I have done with them has come from dragging the very tip of the blade across the enemy as fast as possible. They're great once you get the hang of them but not good if you expect to smash the side of the blade into an enemy and kill it.\n\nMaces/Flails are the heaviest weapons in the game, encumbering you further by the momentum they pick up. This forces you to use the momentum to throw not only the weapon, but also yourself at the enemy. They are the best weapon type for crushing armor and I have killed many foes in one hit with a well-placed ball of iron to the skull. Many players may find them cumbersome because they pull your craft around with their weight; I see it as good physics.\n\nHammers are my personal favorite weapon type; they are based on precision. I wasn't proficient at using hammers until about halfway through the story when I was forced to train for the tournament. The best hits from a hammer come from timing your strike to hit the enemy with the entire head of the hammer flat-on. Glancing blows do very little damage but a hammer can be swung at incredible speeds and a well-placed strike can destroy the heaviest armor.\n\nI can't say much about axes in the game. I haven't spent a lot of time with them but from the time I have used them, I've seen they are a mix of swords and hammers but slightly heavier than both.\n\nThe repetitive mouse controls tire me out at times but the game became immensely more enjoyable the second time I played through it, being able to enjoy perfecting the use of my weapon instead of wildly swinging it about, hoping I would hit something. It becomes much easier to play without dying if you know how to properly use the weapons and take your time. I found myself toying with the enemies and stealing their weapons the second playthrough.\n\nThe story is interesting, in a well-enough developed world. Some cutscenes seemed to drag on for me, especially being a fan of the fast action in the game. I often found myself skipping through them to proceed to the next fight.\n\nThe graphics are obviously not meant to be top of the line but I found a certain simple charm in the art style. The entire game has the appeal of a flash game you would expect to be free on the internet but it engrossed me for some reason.\n\nThe music was enjoyable and didn't overpower or distract from the satisfying crunch I make when destroying the aircrafts of my enemies. I didn't pay much attention to it but it does have a definite prescence.\n\nOnce again, overall, I recommend this game. It's not everyone's cup of tea but it's different and that is something the gaming industry desperately needs more of. I enjoyed the challenge even though I did have to walk away and take a breather once or twice from frustration. It's worth trying out, especially while it's free. I would consider buying it while it's on sale otherwise. Not a 10 USD game but worth supporting the devs nonetheless.","May 6, 2014","true","6.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

The mechanic is cool, sure. The controls are supposed to be hard, yes. But I don't think I'm in the wrong to completely give up on them. Maybe if it wasn't so dang easy to get cornered and devoured on literally the first level you play, I'd like it more. I feel like most of the time, my flying machine doesn't respond at all to my mouse. I'm just bait for those ridiculously molesty catepilar things. The worst part: I've knocked things off the table playing this game. If you use a mouse pad? Not enough space. Clear your desk off if you want anything to do with this game.

There are 3 or 4 different styles that I feel would fit this game better. 3-D characters that sit uncomfortably in the uncanny valley have no real purpose.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dronak/recommended/41100/","dronak","Dronak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dronak/","2192 products in account","I can't recommend this game, mainly because IMO the control system is too difficult for it to be enjoyable.  The game description does say that it uses a "realistic physics simulation" for the combat system, and this is partly why I wanted to try it.  Swinging around a hammer (or the like) using the mouse seemed like an interesting way of playing.  But it's hard -- harder than I expected it to be.  I suppose if you spend the time and effort to figure out the physics, the game is probably a lot more fun.  But I didn't want to.  I like to be able to get into a game right from the start, and I couldn't here.  I also expect early levels of games to be fairly easy and help me learn how things work.  Here, after only a few levels, I failed one repeatedly and the game offered to let me skip the level.  IMO something's wrong when you're given an option to skip levels that early.  If you can't pass early levels, what hope will you have in later levels that should be even harder?  I tried calibrating my mouse, and I tried another review's tip of increasing the mouse's DPI out-of-game and putting the in-game setting to 100, but neither of these seemed to provide any real improvement in the contols.  I guess that means they were working as intended, and I'm just too impatient and/or lazy to spend the time necessary to figure them out.  I've got a huge backlog of games though, and if something's not working well for me from the start, or I can't easily see how to improve and get things rolling, I'm not going to stick with the game.  Sorry.  If you like the idea of rather unique controls and are willing to put enough time and effort into learning the physics to get better at using the controls, give this a shot, but maybe wait for a sale; $5 isn't a bad price, but if it turns out you don't like it, you'd prefer to have spent less money on it.  For others like me who may not want to spend that time and effort, I'd suggest you skip this one.","November 11, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/41100/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1776 products in account","Hammerfight's setting seems to be a variation of cyberpunk with a hint of light fantasy. The music is fitting, and somewhat interesting, but quite repetitive. The graphical presentation is reminiscent of PC games from the 1990s, even though the ship animations could be considered fluid. What is most unique (and incredibly problematic) about the game is the attack mechanic. This involves using the mouse to create inertia and physics based weighted action, which is more complicated than it sounds. There isn't much of a tutorial, nor any kind of instruction for the player besides minimal between mission briefings, and much of the game play is discovered by plenty of trial and error. Meaning that you will have to repeat the majority of the levels a multitude of times until victory is achieved. Upgrades to your ship are obtained as you earn money and purchase items from the shop. The plot appears to be involved, but ends up being a disorganized and fuddled mess, leaving the player with not much care as to what is actually happening. Hammerfight also seems to be prone to crashing at random times, for no apparent reason whatsoever; with an emphasis on when you quit to the desktop. Even though the idea for the game is unique, the implementation for its most important mechanic is a complete and utter failure. Hammerfight has the absolute worst controls and mechanics since Gish. Controlling your ship is the most imprecise experience I can think of, and manages to be generally worse than Gish in all comparable ways. There are various gauges and panels that mysteriously appear and disappear on the screen during battles, and there is never anything explained as to what they mean, what they do, or what they are supposed to be. The mechanic of circling your mouse around continuously and inconsequentially gets boring and tiring extremely fast, as your arm, wrist, and hand will feel like quitting minutes into the game, besides feeling like an idiot for performing such a task. Then, when you realize that your attempts at attacking your enemies are mostly frivolous and ineffective, you will have even less reasons to continue. Hammerfight is yet another good example of a good premise going to waste due to achingly poor and limited design and execution. It has some of the worst controls and mechanics I have ever experienced.\n\nHammerfight is awful.","March 20, 2014","false","2.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It takes a lot of practice in Hammerfight to get anything out of the game. It is brutally hard not because the game itself is challenging, it is because the controls are very difficult to master. Balance is also a huge problem in the game, it becomes more apparent during escort mission where getting hit by the enemies sends you flying across the map, leaving you unable to fulfill the escort mission. While the theme of the game and ship customization is great, the plot is very much lost by the time you are in mid game. At that point the story disintegrates and you are left fighting arena enemies. If you are looking for something very experimental, give this game a whirl, personally I have no intention to play this game ever again.","September 10, 2012","false","3.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","1"

You can't easily tell foreground from background, and the smoke and light effects obscure combat.  In a twitch game this is pretty close to unforgiveable.\nThe difficulty is incredibly uneven.  A number of fights start with the enemy barrelling toward you, which means forced restarts.\nThe armory / weapon selection is pretty pointless.\nThe controls are entirely mouse based, despite the fact stuff like throwing weapons or activating guns could  have been better handled via keyboard.\nThe Hammerball game is ♥♥♥♥ing garbage, and if you select the mission you have to play it several times.\nThe game is just real janky.\n\nBut then the positives:\nWhen it works, the combat is really really fun.  The control scheme is simple (just move your mouse around) but when you're fighting a series of challenging enemies it's just so much fun to tear through them, dodging attacks as you prep your own.  There is planning involved because of the need to attack via rotation.\nThere appears to be meaninful choice in story progression.  I haven't run through more than once, but there are divergent mission selection points as well as pure story options.\nThe graphics are nice and evoke an otherwordly Dune type theme.\nThe missions are short, so even with the uneven difficulty, they aren't too much of a slog.  And more than that, there is an ability to skip missions after you fail them several times, though I did not use it.\n\nOverall, it's worth a playthrough if you have it, at least for an hour or so to see if you can stick out the jankiness to get to the heart of the game.  The main game itself is only like 4 or 5 hours long.","July 27, 2013","true","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game puts you in control of a small helicopter pod that is controlled by the mouse with a weapon hanging off the side. The idea is to swing your weapon with your pod and smash your weapon into your opponent. The faster the weapon travels the more damage it deals and Hammerfights sports a wide variety of weapons for you to pick, from swords, hammers, maces and guns.\n\nHowever, during the single-player campaign, when a player's pod  touched an opponent or thier weapon, even while stationary, it would result in damage and a brief stun to the player. For a physics game this is pretty unfair. I can understand utilizing that for the enemies pod to encourage players using weapons rather than blind tackles. But when the primary factor for damage of one's weapons is speed and momentum, for a physics game this is grossly unfair.\n\nThe game itself feels like it was intended to primarily be played with friends as the story mode, while nessesary to unlock weapons and game modes, feels tacked on and is fairly short. I finished my first run in five hours and the story had a choice system which may or may not mean multiple endings.\n\nHowever the developers were fairly creative with their engine and developed other types of game modes based around the mechanics, such as baseball and a vertical style of soccer.\n\nFor five dollars, as a single player expreience it was lack-luster. Though if it has online multiplayer or if you have friends who are also interested, I could see this game being worth the price.","December 14, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game can tend to be pretty buggy at times, but nothing to make the game seem broken or something just weird fun bugs such as when I atacked an enemy (and I play this game with very high sensitivity to make the swings alot more responsive and hit ALOT more harder) it made me go into the slo-mo reflex mode and I created a implosion with my hit and the physics freaked out making the opponent and me fly across the map hitting the walls then quickly get pulled back towards eachother (rare glitch but hilarious). I don't know game has alot of potential with quite a bit of choices of weapons, such as maces, axes, swords, and even cannon(s? I say it with a question cause I see some guns I've yet to obtain) making it have a nice uniqe fell to how you like to play.\n\nMy only gripe is to how short the game is, sure its just a indie game still would be nice to have more story to it to say the least. Other than that its a nice, unique experience for those who wish to play a game with flying machines that use physics to swing swords and s*** around to kill eachother, its a verry fun game and as for a rating i'd say...\n\n8/10","November 10, 2014","true","45.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The feeling of swinging your mouse in an arc to hit enemies with a weapon is surprisingly solid.  There are many different weapons -- blades, hammers, heavy things on chains, even firearms... I think the rock-on-a-chain ended up fitting my flight style the best, but each had their uses and strategies.\n\nWrapping this interesting combat system together is a very creative setting and story.  I love blimps/zeppelins etc, so a desert warrior society with traditions of dueling propellor-powered hovering craft maneuvering to swing physical weapons at each other?  Count me in!\n\nThere's even a branching story with different gameplay twists and challenges.  I must admit, the path I took became far too hard so I modded the game to give me a bit more health... but I'm pretty sure that path was supposed to be harder than the others to begin with.

Mostly x _ x But it's a   very interesting and fun game to play if You don't have too much time on your hands. I found that the mouse was sometimes a tick too slow, but turning up the sensitivity helped that, since the machines movement is influenced by mouse sensitivity. I found it a lot easier to play with the highest possible sensitivity. The weapons are awesome, though I wished that when You lost a weapon with gems, there was some way to get it back and I wished there had been more weapons or weapon types. A spear of glaive would have been amazing and more types of gems. Also.. Bombs are really damn overpowered when you already have 3 other enemies on you and especially since the enemies can't hurt each other, even if the bombs explode right in their face. I found that to be a huge bother since enemies could just freely throw bombs in your face without having to think of their teammates. Also it was very frustrating to be thrown into a wall  and instantly dying without being able to do the same with the enemy. Though the enemies are not too difficult to beat most of the time, when you have 3 people spamming explosives of different kinds, it becomes very hard to win (arena)\nI also very much enjoyed the different game modes, except for I believe it's called hammer ball, where you have to score goals. This one was highly unfair in my opinion and I never found myself enjoying it.

Mostly x _ x But it's a   very interesting and fun game to play if You don't have too much time on your hands. I found that the mouse was sometimes a tick too slow, but turning up the sensitivity helped that, since the machines movement is influenced by mouse sensitivity. I found it a lot easier to play with the highest possible sensitivity. The weapons are awesome, though I wished that when You lost a weapon with gems, there was some way to get it back and I wished there had been more weapons or weapon types. A spear of glaive would have been amazing and more types of gems. Also.. Bombs are really damn overpowered when you already have 3 other enemies on you and especially since the enemies can't hurt each other, even if the bombs explode right in their face. I found that to be a huge bother since enemies could just freely throw bombs in your face without having to think of their teammates. Also it was very frustrating to be thrown into a wall  and instantly dying without being able to do the same with the enemy. Though the enemies are not too difficult to beat most of the time, when you have 3 people spamming explosives of different kinds, it becomes very hard to win (arena)\nI also very much enjoyed the different game modes, except for I believe it's called hammer ball, where you have to score goals. This one was highly unfair in my opinion and I never found myself enjoying it. Nonetheless an amazing game with interesting and unusual gameplay.","October 20, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The feeling of swinging your mouse in an arc to hit enemies with a weapon is surprisingly solid.  There are many different weapons -- blades, hammers, heavy things on chains, even firearms... I think the rock-on-a-chain ended up fitting my flight style the best, but each had their uses and strategies.\n\nWrapping this interesting combat system together is a very creative setting and story.  I love blimps/zeppelins etc, so a desert warrior society with traditions of dueling propellor-powered hovering craft maneuvering to swing physical weapons at each other?  Count me in!\n\nThere's even a branching story with different gameplay twists and challenges.  I must admit, the path I took became far too hard so I modded the game to give me a bit more health... but I'm pretty sure that path was supposed to be harder than the others to begin with.

Secondly controls require some definite tweaking before you can begin to enjoy the game. If you insist on using the auto-calibration, try to move your mouse at a comfortable constant speed you would use to swinging your weapon in circle. I would recomend setting it manually then testing it in game. I personally prefer it between 700 and 800 dpi but I find that the lower the number the easier it is to fly around the screen without swinging your weapon and higher makes it easier to swing your weapon without moving around to much. And lastly the story can be difficult to follow do to the text boxes automatically scrolling through at what apears to be a speed based on the length of the text while clicking to skip to the next box will frequently pass multiple texts because of the timers. All that aside, once you have your controls set to your liking and have made it far enough into the game to be able to customize your machine with new weapons the gameplay can be very enjoyable.","May 10, 2014","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the graphics the story seemed solid but many times I was wondering what was going. The combat took a little getting used to but after a few levels you get the hang of it.\n\nI find this game had some problems with difficulty scaling some levels were a piece of cake others I seemed to die for no reason at all. Biggest frustration was when you are exiled into the abyss. The first time I had an enemy pick up the hammer I was supposed to use. I had an instant death from the enemy another half dozen times at what I would consider a safe distance from where the enemy pop out fo the ground. I died another 3 or 4 times just picking up my weapon in that fight again starting a safe distance from the ground. I notice in general that with all the chaos from the fights that at times I could be hidden in the smoke and other effects making me an easy kill. The stun effect, while it made some fights easy could easily screw you over if you accidentally touched a wall. While understandable I hated how if I swong my weapon full force and hit a guy it would do decent damage but if I run into a motionless enemy's weapon it would crush me. A bug I found was in the pendelum if you equip to heavy a weapon and actually read the text for the story I started in the lower gear with no way of escaping death from being crushed. Also at times I found during the boss fight with the void robot thing that I would take damage for no apparent reason and no I was not anywhere close to the purple things. I found this happend most when anywhere straight above the boss.\n\nI loved any level with battling armies in front of towns. The environmental distruction.

I sure hope the cops don't show up out of nowhere to lock me up because that's what happens when someone suspects you're crazy. Speaking of cripples, let's talk about the actual gameplay. Apart from it being long and repetitive, the game is actually quite UNIMAGINABLY LONG AND REPTITIVE. Remember when I said all you do is point your flashlight at enemies until they go away? Well you do that about sixty times between every checkpoint, and yes, there are checkpoints, and it's the same encounter every time. Three enemies jump you while the game zooms out to show you in slow-mo where they're coming from, then you turn around and kill them, more pop up except this time it's not really an ambush, it's just happening /again/. And there are always enemies popping up like that, in slow motion so you can see exactly where they're coming from and exactly how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they are to see you. Especially if you get your hands on any ♥♥♥♥ing ammo ever, because this is one of those games where nothing is going to happen when you're walking into some crazy place, ♥♥♥♥ is going to happen when you're walking back /out/. Find some flares and a god damn nuke? Have fun having to waste it all when you get jumped after finding it! There was actually a time when I had to RUN AWAY from a boss, and apparently you can do that, because I had no ♥♥♥♥ing ammo left after the game sent 50 pimp-slappers at me. Speaking of bosses, let's delve deeper into this amazing enemy variety. There are only 5 ♥♥♥♥ing types of enemies in the game: regular ♥♥♥♥-eaters, buffed up ♥♥♥♥-eaters, bosses, flocks of evil birds, and, get this, ♥♥♥♥ING TRACTORS.","July 19, 2013","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're ordered to pick up your sharp-swingy toys and go kill some flying worms.\n\nAforementioned situation lasts for several short levels and frankly gets boring quickly, fortunately the moment the player starts wondering if there's more to Hammerfight than vermin that define the rules of gravity it happens - the game starts for real and you get to confront airborne machines that resemble yours.\n\nIt's worth lasting those few bug infested levels so you can enjoy the rest of this beautifully crafted and unforgiving title.\n\nHammerfight already has a respectable amount of years under its belt yet it manages to age gracefully due to its specific, rich in detail, graphic style.\n\nControls are fully mouse based, both movement and weapon attacks are executed by performing circular, rhytmic mouse movements so it is vital that you have a perfect feel on them translating to in-game responses - start your adventure with this game by tinkering a bit with mouse sensititivy setting in the in-game menu and you should have loads of fun between dying by getting smashed with a rock on a chain or getting bitten right in the engine by an angry flying bug thingy.\n\nFinal aspect worth mentioning is that Hammerfight is a strongly physics based game, weight of weapons and defense modules affects both your speed and the way they feel and interact with enemy machines.\nBlows or slashes dealt to foes are sensationally gratifying which combined with possibility of mounting two different weapons at the same time make you just want to see if it is possible to gracefully stab an opponent while trying to follow with more traditionall approach - smashing him with a boulder on a chain.","October 11, 2014","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mostly x _ x But it's a   very interesting and fun game to play if You don't have too much time on your hands. I found that the mouse was sometimes a tick too slow, but turning up the sensitivity helped that, since the machines movement is influenced by mouse sensitivity. I found it a lot easier to play with the highest possible sensitivity. The weapons are awesome, though I wished that when You lost a weapon with gems, there was some way to get it back and I wished there had been more weapons or weapon types. A spear of glaive would have been amazing and more types of gems. Also.. Bombs are really damn overpowered when you already have 3 other enemies on you and especially since the enemies can't hurt each other, even if the bombs explode right in their face. I found that to be a huge bother since enemies could just freely throw bombs in your face without having to think of their teammates. Also it was very frustrating to be thrown into a wall  and instantly dying without being able to do the same with the enemy. Though the enemies are not too difficult to beat most of the time, when you have 3 people spamming explosives of different kinds, it becomes very hard to win (arena)\nI also very much enjoyed the different game modes, except for I believe it's called hammer ball, where you have to score goals. This one was highly unfair in my opinion and I never found myself enjoying it.

The game can tend to be pretty buggy at times, but nothing to make the game seem broken or something just weird fun bugs such as when I atacked an enemy (and I play this game with very high sensitivity to make the swings alot more responsive and hit ALOT more harder) it made me go into the slo-mo reflex mode and I created a implosion with my hit and the physics freaked out making the opponent and me fly across the map hitting the walls then quickly get pulled back towards eachother (rare glitch but hilarious). I don't know game has alot of potential with quite a bit of choices of weapons, such as maces, axes, swords, and even cannon(s? I say it with a question cause I see some guns I've yet to obtain) making it have a nice uniqe fell to how you like to play.\n\nMy only gripe is to how short the game is, sure its just a indie game still would be nice to have more story to it to say the least. Other than that its a nice, unique experience for those who wish to play a game with flying machines that use physics to swing swords and s*** around to kill eachother, its a verry fun game and as for a rating i'd say...\n\n8/10","November 10, 2014","true","45.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The feeling of swinging your mouse in an arc to hit enemies with a weapon is surprisingly solid.  There are many different weapons -- blades, hammers, heavy things on chains, even firearms... I think the rock-on-a-chain ended up fitting my flight style the best, but each had their uses and strategies.\n\nWrapping this interesting combat system together is a very creative setting and story.  I love blimps/zeppelins etc, so a desert warrior society with traditions of dueling propellor-powered hovering craft maneuvering to swing physical weapons at each other?  Count me in!\n\nThere's even a branching story with different gameplay twists and challenges.  I must admit, the path I took became far too hard so I modded the game to give me a bit more health... but I'm pretty sure that path was supposed to be harder than the others to begin with.  So try Hammerfight -- there's a demo now (there wasn't when I bought it).  Make sure your mouse is in good condition! :-)","July 8, 2011","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Secondly controls require some definite tweaking before you can begin to enjoy the game. If you insist on using the auto-calibration, try to move your mouse at a comfortable constant speed you would use to swinging your weapon in circle. I would recomend setting it manually then testing it in game. I personally prefer it between 700 and 800 dpi but I find that the lower the number the easier it is to fly around the screen without swinging your weapon and higher makes it easier to swing your weapon without moving around to much. And lastly the story can be difficult to follow do to the text boxes automatically scrolling through at what apears to be a speed based on the length of the text while clicking to skip to the next box will frequently pass multiple texts because of the timers. All that aside, once you have your controls set to your liking and have made it far enough into the game to be able to customize your machine with new weapons the gameplay can be very enjoyable.","May 10, 2014","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the graphics the story seemed solid but many times I was wondering what was going. The combat took a little getting used to but after a few levels you get the hang of it.\n\nI find this game had some problems with difficulty scaling some levels were a piece of cake others I seemed to die for no reason at all. Biggest frustration was when you are exiled into the abyss. The first time I had an enemy pick up the hammer I was supposed to use. I had an instant death from the enemy another half dozen times at what I would consider a safe distance from where the enemy pop out fo the ground. I died another 3 or 4 times just picking up my weapon in that fight again starting a safe distance from the ground. I notice in general that with all the chaos from the fights that at times I could be hidden in the smoke and other effects making me an easy kill. The stun effect, while it made some fights easy could easily screw you over if you accidentally touched a wall. While understandable I hated how if I swong my weapon full force and hit a guy it would do decent damage but if I run into a motionless enemy's weapon it would crush me. A bug I found was in the pendelum if you equip to heavy a weapon and actually read the text for the story I started in the lower gear with no way of escaping death from being crushed. Also at times I found during the boss fight with the void robot thing that I would take damage for no apparent reason and no I was not anywhere close to the purple things. I found this happend most when anywhere straight above the boss.\n\nI loved any level with battling armies in front of towns. The environmental distruction. Overall originality and the veriety of mini games.","May 10, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems to be akin to a steampunk Ottoman Empire, inhabited by a handful of tribes at uneasy peace with one another. There are also sentient malicious robots, giant bugs, and magical crystals.\nStory comes second to gameplay, but is not nonexistent. In a nutshell, you control the last surviving member of you tribe, the Gaiars, in an attempt to fight back against the corrupt powers which destroyed your home. There's also something going one about three magic crystals that must never come together, a wall of fog fast approaching, and an incomprehensible Lovecraftian evil on the horizon.\nGameplay is where Hammerfight really shines. You use your mouse to control your machine, which has a weapon hanging freely from its side, and use your momentum and inertia to swing or stab or whatever. There are hammers, axes, flails, rocks tied to chains, long curved swords, straight pointy swords—each with their own fighting style to figure out. You can also mount armor to your machine, or use a cannon, or carry throwing spears, or mount two different swords and link them so that they pivot as a single item, or use a single sword with enchanted gems inlaid that allow you to phase through enemies while at the same time lighting them on fire and healing you.\nIt's not without its flaws of course: The AI (especially allies) leaves a lot to be desired, and the explosion effects need to be dialed down a bit, but overall Hammerfight is a fun, challenging, and ultimately unique game that is worth checking out.","June 25, 2014","true","56.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(i dont mind adds a bit of nosatalgia to it). the ui isnt utilized properly. can not be adjusted and no transparency. ( i perosnally would like to see a bar at the bottom that is transparent)\nthats about it.\n\n-pro\ndynamic story, cool weapons, proper difficulty, fun boss fights, different game modes, destroyable enviroment and replayable.\nNicely done story with multiple story paths for alternative game play. adding to the replayability. Mixing and matching weapons you've earn, bought, or stolen from your enemies is a lot of fun and adds to risk vs rewards for the next set of challenges. smashing your weapon and/or enemies into the enviroment is very enjoyable as little bits of shrapnel, confetti, brick, and all kinds of debri fall from and around everything adding damage to you or your foes. and finally agame with some difficulty to it, and doesnt hold your hand.\nAnother factor that goes under radar is precision, speed, and combos. using precision to hit a weakspot or enemy weapon can net you lots awesome, when combing it with speed and multiple enemies. such as an enemy dropping their weapon, prolonged stun, turning enemies into pinballs\n\nyour only tutorial goes as followed.\ntake this rock on a chain and crush that guy with said rock on a chain.\n:)enjoy","May 9, 2014","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept is simple, destroy the opponents Bot-Chopper, the controls  mainly use the mouse, you use swinging motions to attack with your Flail (Mace on a chain) and simply move the mouse to maneuver around the battlefield. It can be quite dificult to move and attack, but after a while,you'll get used to it. Hammerfight has lots of potential and is quite fun, but i've seen better.

Mostly x _ x But it's a   very interesting and fun game to play if You don't have too much time on your hands. I found that the mouse was sometimes a tick too slow, but turning up the sensitivity helped that, since the machines movement is influenced by mouse sensitivity. I found it a lot easier to play with the highest possible sensitivity. The weapons are awesome, though I wished that when You lost a weapon with gems, there was some way to get it back and I wished there had been more weapons or weapon types. A spear of glaive would have been amazing and more types of gems. Also.. Bombs are really damn overpowered when you already have 3 other enemies on you and especially since the enemies can't hurt each other, even if the bombs explode right in their face. I found that to be a huge bother since enemies could just freely throw bombs in your face without having to think of their teammates. Also it was very frustrating to be thrown into a wall  and instantly dying without being able to do the same with the enemy. Though the enemies are not too difficult to beat most of the time, when you have 3 people spamming explosives of different kinds, it becomes very hard to win (arena)\nI also very much enjoyed the different game modes, except for I believe it's called hammer ball, where you have to score goals. This one was highly unfair in my opinion and I never found myself enjoying it. Nonetheless an amazing game with interesting and unusual gameplay.","October 20, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems to be akin to a steampunk Ottoman Empire, inhabited by a handful of tribes at uneasy peace with one another. There are also sentient malicious robots, giant bugs, and magical crystals.\nStory comes second to gameplay, but is not nonexistent. In a nutshell, you control the last surviving member of you tribe, the Gaiars, in an attempt to fight back against the corrupt powers which destroyed your home. There's also something going one about three magic crystals that must never come together, a wall of fog fast approaching, and an incomprehensible Lovecraftian evil on the horizon.\nGameplay is where Hammerfight really shines. You use your mouse to control your machine, which has a weapon hanging freely from its side, and use your momentum and inertia to swing or stab or whatever. There are hammers, axes, flails, rocks tied to chains, long curved swords, straight pointy swords—each with their own fighting style to figure out. You can also mount armor to your machine, or use a cannon, or carry throwing spears, or mount two different swords and link them so that they pivot as a single item, or use a single sword with enchanted gems inlaid that allow you to phase through enemies while at the same time lighting them on fire and healing you.\nIt's not without its flaws of course: The AI (especially allies) leaves a lot to be desired, and the explosion effects need to be dialed down a bit, but overall Hammerfight is a fun, challenging, and ultimately unique game that is worth checking out.","June 25, 2014","true","56.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I greatly enjoyed progressing rom a lowly captured slave to a revered warrior during the campaign, though the plot was indeed wonky at times.  The physics are awesome and there is nothing like a perfectly executed blow that either destroys your opponent outright or sends him careening around the level like a living cannonball.  The arena mode in which you lay waste to waves of progressively harder opponents is a distilled version of the enjoyable combat and can make for many extra hours of gameplay.  The selection of weapons and the ability to dual wield leave the game open for nearly unlimited experimentation with different "loadouts."\nDespite these strengths, the game has several rough edges.  The menu uses a touchy sliding mechanism which, though artistically unique, can make it hard to even select a game mode when you use a highly sensitive mouse.  Technical anomalies are common and pervasive, and despite the fact that my laptop handily exceeds the stated system requirements, I would often encounter game breaking slowdown and crashes.  These issues were even more vexing when I was unable to fully overcome them even after hours searching through forums and tweaking the .config file.  Also, I was not able to find any recent activity from the developer anywhere online, so I wouldn't hold out hope for any new updates or patches unless they come from an ambitious fan.\nWhile I definitely feel like I got my money's worth out of this game, I should not have had to work so hard just to make the game playable.  When Hammerfight is at it's best it's a fabulous experiment in fast paced physics based gameplay.  At its worst, it's a tragically unplayable mess that is resistant to a solution.  Try the demo first and if you can get it working, dive in.","January 6, 2014","true","45.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have flying machines fighting one another using basic physics to flail their weapons at one another.\n\nIt can be very frustrating, but you will enjoy spending some time trying to master the basics of your flying machine, adding weapons of your choice, gems that'll give you small boost and... Surviving!\n\nI've done the complete game and at the current price, I know the game art, coding, sounds and every single work that was spent over this game is a rightful price for such a good time (There may be some problems, but they mostly came to my advantage)\n\nSo start your engine and go up high above the ground, or deep down in the dept of a cave hunting down furious beasts, as you will be the greatest pilot! Move on! Crush your opponents! Slice them! Or burn their engines and collect the coins of victory!","January 6, 2014","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The control scheme is novel, the lore is creative, and the customization of your craft is a nice touch. However, none of these ideas are implemented well. Using the mouse to flail your weapon around and control your movement is frequently frustrating, especially when all of the smoke and particle effects obscure what is happening. I often had no idea what was happening until I died and then realized I was taking damage. The lore is creative but it feels hollow, like the authors just picked creative arrabic names because they sounded interesting instead of planning how those names would read in game. Finally the customization system is flawed. I could never figure out a way to choose what I was buying. I am unsure if it is randomly generated, developed along a tech tree, or if the GUI is just not informative enough to let me know what to do to change the selection.\n\nTo close, its rare that I stop playing a game out of frustration, especially one as novel as Hammerfight. But the flaws outweigh the fun for me. I think they will for you too.","January 24, 2014","false","35.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed everything about it - art, story, atmosphere, and especially gameplay. Your vehicle's movements follow the movements of your mouse, and by moving your vehicle in a certain way you also swing the weapon attached to it (Just make sure to crank up in-game mouse sensitivity to the max, otherwise be ready for a world of pain in your arm). Combat has quite a lot of freedom to it and feels very very meaty. Smacking an enemy on the head with a bigass hammer has never felt this good.Controls may be hard to get used to, but once you do - it's very fun and addicting.\n\nMy only big (huge, GINORMOUS) disappointment is the lack of online multiplayer, although you can play with a friend on the same computer if you happen to have a spare mouse.\n\nStill, it's a great game if you like a good story, or even if you just want to hop in for a few minutes and smack things around in blind rage.

I greatly enjoyed progressing rom a lowly captured slave to a revered warrior during the campaign, though the plot was indeed wonky at times.  The physics are awesome and there is nothing like a perfectly executed blow that either destroys your opponent outright or sends him careening around the level like a living cannonball.  The arena mode in which you lay waste to waves of progressively harder opponents is a distilled version of the enjoyable combat and can make for many extra hours of gameplay.  The selection of weapons and the ability to dual wield leave the game open for nearly unlimited experimentation with different "loadouts."\nDespite these strengths, the game has several rough edges.  The menu uses a touchy sliding mechanism which, though artistically unique, can make it hard to even select a game mode when you use a highly sensitive mouse.  Technical anomalies are common and pervasive, and despite the fact that my laptop handily exceeds the stated system requirements, I would often encounter game breaking slowdown and crashes.  These issues were even more vexing when I was unable to fully overcome them even after hours searching through forums and tweaking the .config file.  Also, I was not able to find any recent activity from the developer anywhere online, so I wouldn't hold out hope for any new updates or patches unless they come from an ambitious fan.\nWhile I definitely feel like I got my money's worth out of this game, I should not have had to work so hard just to make the game playable.  When Hammerfight is at it's best it's a fabulous experiment in fast paced physics based gameplay.  At its worst, it's a tragically unplayable mess that is resistant to a solution.  Try the demo first and if you can get it working, dive in.","January 6, 2014","true","45.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have flying machines fighting one another using basic physics to flail their weapons at one another.\n\nIt can be very frustrating, but you will enjoy spending some time trying to master the basics of your flying machine, adding weapons of your choice, gems that'll give you small boost and... Surviving!\n\nI've done the complete game and at the current price, I know the game art, coding, sounds and every single work that was spent over this game is a rightful price for such a good time (There may be some problems, but they mostly came to my advantage)\n\nSo start your engine and go up high above the ground, or deep down in the dept of a cave hunting down furious beasts, as you will be the greatest pilot!

That the mouse is both the momentum generation and movement controls was a neat idea, but just doesn't work. Half the time any swinging momentum I generated to hit the opponet was wasted as I would instead run into the enemy myself. The other half I would simply miss and catch their weapon with my face.If I could control movement with my keyboard, then I would have probably had more fun.\n\nAlso the idea of local co-op seems a little absurd. I was covering half my desk moving the mouse around, trying to keep the momentum going and aiming it. Up to 4 people going head to head sounds like it will take place more in the real world than the game as players slam their mouses into each other.\n\nThe design aesthic and story seem nice, but they aren't enought to hold a game that is in dire need of a controls rework.","May 9, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perhaps the most frustrating thing about Hammerfight is that it so bipolar: innovative and terrifically executed core mechanics make you want to play, then the significant frustratings and nagging issues make you want to stop playing, but then you get drawn back in by the core gameplay, and so on.  I'll recommend this game, but only to the buyer with substantial patience and forgiveness for a game that is in itself unforgiving.\n\nAt it's core, Hammerfight is a 2d aerial combat game.  Battles are fought between flying machines with attached swinging weapons (hammers, swords, flails and the like).  Here's the thing: there is no "swing weapon" button (except for the throwable weapons that I don't use anyway because they're not nearly as fun).  You swing your weapon by moving your ship in such a way that the weapon swings around you (side note: in the options menu, crank up the mouse sensitivity unless you like moving like a snail) and connects with your opponents.\n\nThe core combat fueled by this gameplay is exhilarating.  You have a massive variety of weapons to choose from, and while they are various takes on classic archetypes (e.g., sword, hammer, axe, etc.), they have a variety of nuances that give them distinct advantages and disadvantages.  Swords, for instance, require close-range flying and are repelled by armor, but carve up a flyer in no time on a direct hit.  Hammers and flails don't do as much hull damage, but can shatter armor and send enemies flying across the screen.  When you get the flying skill to start delivering massive hits, the results are extremely cathartic: the sounds of crumpling metal and splintering wood combined with the sight of your opponent hurtling into a wall and exploding rank among some of the most epic moments in any game I've played, let alone a 2-d one.\n\nBut underneath this overwhelmingly successful core is a wealth of nagging frustrations.  The UI is abysmal, often blocking your view of fighters that are well within striking distance.  Enemies and allies alike - especially in higher levels of play - have a tendency to pepper you with ranged weapon fire that, even if it fails to hit you, still blinds you (white screen) and produces an extremely annoying high-pitched noise (if you have tinnitus, you know).\n\nBut above all: the game is loaded with unexpected and seemingly unfair deaths.  You will die a lot in this game, and while many times this is because of poor piloting, on numerous occasions you are killed from full health for seemingly no reason at all.  As best as I can tell, the game's physics are such that sometimes a thrown weapon or environmental object can get "jammed up" in your ship's weapons, which results in it constantly hitting you.  In arena, some enemies explode when you kill them, often times killing you from full health.  I get that this is an intentional mechanic (suicide bombers), but in a game that's supposed to be about shattering impacts, punishing a player for attempting to deliver such an impact is unbelievably backward.  I have died many times in this game, and probably <1% of my deaths is from actually getting hit by an enemy's weapon; almost all of them are from random explosions, a single thrown weapon or environmental object, or unidentifiable cause.\n\nI love this game, and I hate this game, and I can't stand how its bipolarity keeps me conflicted.  I play it because I love the gameplay, and while it's fun I will inevitably stop playing it out of frustration later.  I recommend this game with *extreme* caution; if you have the patience for the game's unforgiving, and at times seemingly unfair, nature, it'll be a lot of fun for you, especially at its price tag.","May 20, 2014","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am giving the insane russian man who made this game more money for essentially no benefit to myself because the game is good and I want him to have more of my money.\n\nthe story basically feels like someone translated Dune into Russian and then back into English while drunk, but people who play games for the story are stupid and bad and should read a ♥♥♥♥ing book instead. like Dune, Dune was a pretty good book, but you have to stop reading after like Dune Messiah because after that Herbert must have had a ♥♥♥♥ing stroke or some ♥♥♥♥. Then later his idiot son started writing more and they're bad, don't read them.\n\nanyway the story in this game accomplishes exactly what it needs to, which is giving justification for a man in a turban to show up on top of the screen at the start of every arena fight and read off an increasingly long list of the titles and ranks and nicknames you have acquired by spiking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s into the concrete with a giant hammer.\n\nthe gameplay is super ♥♥♥♥ing satisfying and fun and good, and a surprising amount of variety is extracted from the base concept of "hit things with a big hammer attached to a helicopter". There's sports, hunting, duelling, warring, robot warring, and something that's kind of like pinball. Also the environments are all destructible so when you miss and hit a wall ♥♥♥♥ breaks off of it and you can then hit it at your opponents, and when you ♥♥♥♥ up the stupid pinball stage again you can throw your hammer at the sign that lists the score you were supposed to get and knock a few digits off it and pretend you won. you can also use a cannon as a counterweight to your hammer and shoot people with it on your backswing. There's also a large variety of weapons, some of which are not, in fact, hammers.\n\ntips: the game will try to calibrate your mouse for you when you start it up, totally ignore whatever it says and go set the dpi all the way down. yes, this makes the cursor in the menus fly around like it's on crack, that's the price you have to pay for maximum power.\n\nwhen the game gives you a choice between stages like 10 minutes in and labels one of them as "hard" it means that it's an escort mission where you have to defend a worm blimp from exploding bees with a sword and it's an actual ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare, holy ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ those bees. You have to play the bee mission to unlock the hunting mode where you can get magic gems to make your hammer better. Here's a better idea though: the game gives you one of the best gems like 3 missions later so if you don't ♥♥♥♥ up and stick it in a wooden training mallet and save it for when you get a good weapon you can totally ignore the hunting mode and leave those bees in hell where they belong.\n\nsometimes when you're playing hammerball the normal ball gets replaced by a special ball worth more points. Usually it's an exploding ball and sometimes it's a little robot ball that flies around on its own, but occasionally it gets replaced by a giant robot octopus that instantly kills you and all the other players by shooting lightning at you. when this happens in the final round while you're winning headbutt your monitor until you pass out and then go outside\n","February 12","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The trick is, your movement imparts realistic momentum to your weapons.\n\nAfter his village is attacked, a young hunter is the sole survivor of his clan.  Taken into slavery in the gladiatorial arena, he must work his way up the ranks until he can exact revenge on those who killed his people.  The game plays out as a series of missions, each a fight sequence either against a set number of enemies or for a certain amount of time you must survive.  Arena mode is an ever-escalating sequence of fights that allow you to loot weapons and money from enemies that you can then use in the main story.\n\nHammerfight can be played almost entirely with the mouse.  Spin it in a circle and you’ll fling your weapon around your machine.  Learning the correct timing on when to speed up and when to juke to deliver a crushing blow to an enemy is critical to your success.  Eventaully you gain access to a training hall full of weapons you can select from, each with their own style of play.  Swords are good against soft targets, and hammers crush armoured enemies.  Guns are a great multipurpose tool.  It is a unique and innovative control scheme that allows for a few different playstyles.\n\nThe graphics are pretty cool, but often it becomes difficult to tell what is going on in the heat of battle.  With all the effects from explosions, bits of the destroyable environment flying around, and the multitude of attachments you can get on your machine, the entire screen is just a blur of wood and metal and flame.  Often your machine will get trapped in a corner, unable to move while you take constant damage from touching the walls or your enemy, but you can’t see where you are to try and escape.  The soundtrack is awesome, though.  Just listen to the battle theme in the trailer above and tell me you don’t want to fight someone.\n\nThe story suffers from an over-abundance of Proper Nouns.  Events and characters are not described very well at all, and you will struggle to determine who each character is and how they relate.  Not that it really matters, you can just work your way through the game destroying anything that tries to kill you and you’ll win.  But the game wants you to take the story seriously and to invest in its narrative, yet it never gives you the chance to do so.  I still do not understand how to find gems to augment my weapons, or how that helps me, even though I stumbled upon three of them throughout the campaign.\n\nI have mixed feelings about this game.  On the one hand, the gameplay is innovative.  But the nonsensical story, wild difficulty spikes, and visuals that easily obscure the action make me say you should take a pass on Hammerfight.","December 13, 2015","false","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Используется регдолл-физика, в геймплее есть прокачка персонажа, покупки, достижения. Помимо основной сюжетной линии, есть дополнительные уровни: Арена (сражения с толпами врагов), Грим (подземелья с тварями), Хаммербол (забей мяч молотком в ворота противника). Может есть и другие, пока недоступные для меня.\nМожно прокачивать одновременно несколько персонажей, со своим инвентарем и достижениями.\nСписок оружия впечатляет, есть мечи, моргенштерны, молотки, топоры, стреляющее оружие. Одновременно в руке (?) можно иметь два вида оружия, причем в игре они могут сцепляться вместе. Доступное оружие находится в Холле, где можно докупать всё необходимое. В оружие можно вставлять камни (которые даются по ходу игры или добываются в Гриме), тогда у оружия появляются дополнительные свойства. Можно покупать броню и метательное оружие (кинжалы, звездочки), а также различные бомбы. Также есть "порции здоровья", что помогает на высоких уровнях.\nВ целом мне игра нравится за быстрый геймплей, можно отвлечься на нее на 15 минут, чтобы пройти очередной уровень. Также нравится физика игры, реально ощущаешь тяжесть или легкость оружия и брони. Дополнительную реалистичность придает то, что размахивать оружием приходится буквально самому, т.е. мышкой раскручивать меч, чтобы получить более сильный удар.","November 11, 2013","true","82.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is quite possibly the most infuriating I've ever played.\n\nYou have control of a small flying machine. You move it around using just the mouse. There is a large weapon tied to your flying machine which swings around as you pull the mouse in different directions. Imagine if  helicoptors battled with flails...\n\nComing into contact with an enemy (ship or giant beast), it's weapon or the scenary for any length of time and your health bar will suddenly vanish and your ship will lurch in the opposite direction. Regaining control of the ship is awkward due to the giant weapon on your ship pull your around at the same time as being smacked across the screen by enemies.\n\nIf you hadn't guessed, this is a recommendation to avoid this game.

To make things easier, I'll list out the pros and cons of the game.\n\nPros:\n-Cheap and reasonable price.\n-Small size. Only takes a minute or two to download the whole game.\n-Great, smooth yet chaotic physics-based gameplay. So far, I haven't encountered any glitches, and the physics of the game is overall pretty smooth. You can definitely feel the weight of the weapons as you're swinging them around and crashing them into your enemies, let alone when a bunch of other machines are doing the same thing.\n-Grim mode is awesome. It's essentially a casual mode where you fight flying worms, giant bees and a bunch of other random demonic creatures from hell. Mass-killing a ton of monsters by swinging around gigantic axes or maces is very stress-releasing, too.\n-Decent storyline. Not much to say, I'm just kinda glad the game at least has some story to it.\n-Can't really explain it, but there's just something very satisfying about swinging a flail at full momentum and hurling it towards a machine/ monster, hearing that majestic crushing sound and watching the guts/random metal parts and coins raining down upon the glorious battlefield.\n-There's a multiplayer feature too, if you have a bunch of other mice that you can connect to your PC.\n\nCons:\n-You need a large mousepad that is glued to your table in order to comfortable play this game. Otherwise, expect the mousepad to constantly move around.\n-The gameplay is too chaotic for co-op missions since in a game where you're mostly ramming yourself towards the nearest guy on the battlefield, friendly fire is near unavoidable. This is especially problematic in Grim mode, since the other hunters can unexpectedly and suddenly ram into you. In most of these missions, 50% of the damage you take comes from your allies.\n-Explosives are very uncontrollable, especially when a bunch of people are using them at the same time. Again, this is an even bigger problem when even your allies are using explosives.","April 17","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s been a very long time since then, but I think I initially dropped it because there is no Steam cloud saving and I lost my save data.\n\nAs you may have noticed from the “Mixed” user reviews on Steam, Hammerfight is a bit of a conflicting game. First of all, this game does not have any sort of video options. You’re stuck with a 4:3 window. This wasn’t so bad when I played it on Windows XP, but we’re kind of far past that point now. The window is tiny if you are running a 1900 resolution setup. I can’t really say the physics engine has aged well either.\n\nI used to love this game, really. But every time I tried to come back and play it again, it just didn’t click with me. It feels like I’m fighting against the controls, and nothing has really kept up with the times. The idea behind this game is nice, but it’s too old and doesn’t play well after all these years.\n","April 17","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If Hammerfight game got that attention it could even be added the idea of a multiplayer wich is always welcome on most any game.\n\nYes, I do recomend, 10/10\n-Daankai™","May 19","true","35.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
