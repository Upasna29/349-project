Great story/lore\n2. Your decisions shape the story/relationships with other characters\n3. Great graphics/music/voice acting\n4. Maps are easy to follow\n5. Trail feature allows you to see where you need to go for a quest\n6. Seamless changeable battle stances\n7. Point and click facing enemies rather than mindless one-click automation (More engaging battles)\n8. Learning about a set character's backstory and personality (Refreshing change from spending a lot of time customizing a character yourself)\n9. Easy to follow/understandable/simple talent tree (Refreshing change from tedious, complicated talent trees)\n\nCONS:\n1. TERRIBLE camera angles / control. I mean it was so bad, I almost didn't want to play this game.\n2. No zooming in feature.\n3. Playing as Lucas is darn near impossible. You're in for a huge challenge if you decide to play as him.\n4. This game has near NOTHING to do with the first two games, therefore making it more of its own game rather than a continuation to the series.\n\nI felt like I owed this game my two cents because honestly I'm astonished at the amount of bad reviews. I will fully admit to this: After I first bought the game I only played it for one hour before giving up in frustration. The camera control in this game is absolutely TERRIBLE. If they would have just made it so the camera follows the way the character is facing, it would have solved the problem entirely. I also hated the fact I can't zoom in at all, because I like to look at my character and the monster detail closely on occasion. Despite this, I decided to give the game another chance later on because I am a huge fan of the Dungeon Siege series and I really wanted to finish the third installment. Getting used to the stupid camera controls took a lot of patience but eventually I found I had almost shrugged off an awesome game. The lore and storyline is rich and engaging, arguably the best aspect of this game. I also really enjoy how my decisions shape the game's outcomes and relationships with the other playable characters, much like The Walking Dead series (which I also love). The graphics and music are great, the voice acting is excellent. I liked how the maps were easy to follow and I almost never got lost due to the really great quest trail feature. Being able to swap between "stances" or whatever you want to call them during battle was near seamless. I actually liked that you had to point and click in the direction of the enemy rather than mindlessly clicking once on a target and letting your character attack by themselves as in DS1 and DS2(that is, if you choose the DS1 style of doing that when playing DS2). Many will argue that just having four generic characters is boring and un-inventive on the player's part - however I personally feel it is a refreshing change. You get to uncover this character's rich backstory, and learn their personality and style as you play. It's almost like getting to know a new friend rather than just making up a fake one. lol. Besides, I could spend upwards of 1-2 hours fully customizing my character down to the shape of her nose (*cough* Elder Scrolls anyone?) and for what? She's going to be wearing a helmet anyway, and even if you have a mod to make it so you can see your character's face, how often are you actually going to look at it? It ends up being kinda tedious, especially since I just want to get onward to the game! I -would- have liked to at least be given the choice of keeping their generic name OR coming up with my own like some RPGs, but meh it's not a game-changer for me either. As for other things I DON'T like about this game, let's talk about Lucas for a second. I'm a straight girl, so when I saw Lucas I was like wow this guy looks super hot...I'm going to try him out. ;P BIG mistake. The problem with Lucas is that to do any real damage you have to basically be up the enemy's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and when you're in the process of doing that in a huge mass of flustercuck you're going to get mowed down as often as the White House lawn. Unless you fully specced into every healing ability possible and have a ton of chaos:vampirism as Lucas, then you're in for a world of pain my friend. I don't really like when a game forces me to spend all my talent currency in ONE thing. Like okay well if I don't want to die over and over and over again I better spend everything in every healing ability possible. Super lame! My favorite character has got to be Katarina. Her gear looks cute and girly, her voice actress sounds exotic and awesome, and she hits like a truck from afar. I can just sit back and send my cool hound in while doing some badarse sniping and when the enemy gets too close I can just switch to my sidearms and deal powerful knockback damage. Amazing. Anjali is also fricken AWESOME. She's absolutely beautiful, especially in her fire form with all those tribal tattoos and the orange eyes. The way they made her voice actress (as well as the other archon in the game) sound all ethereal-ish was cool as hell too, it really added depth to the exotic element of her race. Her fire jackal is super cute, I love the little noises he makes!! Her self-healing is ridiculously through the roof, it's almost impossible to die as her if you do it right. She also has some decent range on her attacks, and both of her forms are viable though I tend to stick more to her fire form. Reinhart is the only one I haven't tried yet and meh, I probably won't. For some reason whenever I look at him I think of the Sultan from Aladdin and I start laughing. Also the way he talks is kind of annoying. lol. I've never even used him as the AI. I'm sure he's a great character with great abilities if I just gave him the chance, but meh. Moving on, I see a lot of people complaining about the very basic talent tree but let me tell you something, I WELCOMED it. Huge, complicated talent trees with a billion different avenues has always been one of the things I actually DON'T like about RPGs. It's like, here let me google online what is the very best talent tree and fricken -research- how to play my dang character. Otherwise I'm going to be halfway through a game and realize shoot I totally screwed up my talent tree and I can't go back so now I either keep playing and pretend it doesn't bother me or restart. GROAN. It's like work instead of play at that point! In closing, I see a lot of the angry people are commenting that they don't like this game simply because it isn't like the other two. True, it IS sort-of a letdown that this game has next-to-nothing similar with the first two games other than some very minor basic lore ties. But I wouldn't just throw out the whole thing just because it isn't a similar or because it "shames the franchise". I tend to want to look at it as its own game...just ignore the whole continuation of the 3 slapped onto the name. :P","May 3, 2015","true","17.1"," 85 of 105 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","85","105","3","0"

He played the generic wizard and I played the generic swordsman. We played on the hardest difficulty. While the game offers some fun hack and slash combat, there's nothing very special with it. Each character has two modes (zwiehander/sword+shield, rifle/dual pistols, etc.) with three skills per mode in addition to three defensive abilitites. While I do believe you're supposed to use both of your modes, there seemed to be no benefit in doing so for me. I just went berserk with my zweihanders and that worked terrifically.\n\nI can't say anything about lower difficulties but we mostly found the regular enemies to be rather trivial while the bosses were hard only because they could kill you in one or two hits. This was challenging and fun in its own way but not in a good way as this was more like artificial difficulty where you're punished for a single mistake.\n\nWith this in mind, the balance between bosses wasn't good, either. One early boss was super hard while others were a breeze. The penultimate boss was one of the hardest in the game while the last boss was a joke.\n\nLastly, the game had some notable issues with other aspects. The depiction of women felt rather sexistic as you could usually judge the moral level of a woman by looking at the size of her breasts. Big breasts - good person. Small breasts - evil person. The camera was a pain as my partner and I limited each others' movements, which was super problematic as he was a long range character and I was purely melee. As far as I know, the game is purely a console port and although it could actually be good, I'm not so certain that it's good if you don't have a gamepad to play with.\n\nSo that's my review. You can see that I ended up giving it a recommendation but that's a weak recommendation. I do not recommend buying this game unless you'll either have someone to play with or if you can get it for less than the base cost.","March 4, 2014","true","23.9"," 98 of 128 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","98","128","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cinetyk/recommended/39160/","Cinetyk","Cinetyk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cinetyk/","179 products in account","Summary  (TL;DR)\nDungeon Siege III, while not stellar, is a bit underrated or otherwise suffers unjustly from its departure from the original games of old. Those had more of a Diablo-like interface, with top down, mouse point&click, party management gameplay, with classes, gear and loot. Dungeon Siege III was clearly designed for consoles and controller use, as the keyboard and mouse controls are very awkward and it has a more 3rd person view. Without a controller, it is very difficult to play this game.\nI’m a fan of the original game, and I found that despite the change in paradigm to a 3rd person hack and slash action RPG designed for the controller, the Dungeon Siege “feel” is there. Experiencing the different events in the story, meeting new characters and talking to them, going from location to location, playing the combat, collecting loot, and optimizing abilities and equipment in regards to combat, all was rather enjoyable. None was arguably groundbreaking, but was interesting and enjoyable enough to keep me invested for 32 hours, which, in retrospect, is saying something. 7/10\n\nDetailed review\nRPG-wise, it’s actually quite deep with lots of stats and mechanics. You choose from 4 different main characters with different characteristics and play styles: a knight for meele/tank, a rifle and pistol/shotgun wielding ranged character, an agile fire magic female warrior and a spell casting mage/scientist. One of the other characters follows you as an AI companion. Each character has 2 stances that can be switched on the fly, each stance has one attack and 3 active abilities. There are also 3 defensive abilities per character. Active abilities include heavier or AOE attacks, buffs/debuffs, or even summoned creatures. Defensive abilities include healing, pushing back of enemies or buffing yourself. As you use attacks and abilities you fill their mastery bar and once you’ve mastered it, you can perform an empowered version of it. As you level up, you can develop each of your abilities in a branching choice, for instance do you want more damage or increased chance to knockback opponents? You can go all in on one, or choose any balance between the two. Additionally, there are passive “talents” to level up. With all this and also the different equipment you loot, buy and enhance with enchantments (3 weapon slots, 4 armor slots, a ring and a pendant slot), with different stats, you have a vast array of possibilities. You can choose the abilities’ perks to work well with one another enhancing your favorite play style, and also compliment your companion’s abilities to your own, which is very satisfying, particularly, I suspect, in local coop.\nHowever, with this 2-stance system sometimes it’s a bit difficult perform actions from different stances in the heat of battle with a lot going on. Of course, it would be easier with pausable combat and 1-9 keyboard hotkeys, but this is a 3rd person action game. Also, the way aiming works is a bit awkward, especially for ranged combat, as you have to move in the direction of an enemy to soft lock on it. This results in sometimes having to move away to get a better line of sight to the desired target. I got used to it, though. Additionally, the companion AI is not ideal, though it’s reasonable. Again, local coop should be fun.\n\nI won’t spoil the story, which I found surprisingly interesting, meaning that the game is far from a loot fest. Events are set approximately 150 years after the first game, much of what once was has fallen or faded, and the characters from the first game are now close to legends, which also means you don’t need to play the other games to enjoy this one. You’ll learn of what happened as you progress in the game, your journey has always that tone of grandeur lost as you seek to reestablish some of that. You’ll meet interesting characters and the plot will make you reflect on your actions and compare them to the main antagonist, and also think about your dialogue choices. The voice acting is also good and the dialogues lengthy. The lore is very well done, tying in nicely to the Dungeon Siege universe, and is deepened by finding some books or documents, and talking to characters. You’ll even explore a location directly related to the characters of the first game, which was extremely satisfying for a fan.\n\nThe progression is mostly linear with growing scale of locations, enemies and events. It’s an action RPG, but the pacing and amount of enemies is not insane like for instance on Diablo 3, though some battles are more enemy heavy. Though there are different and varied locations with enemies matching them, “dungeons” aren’t as big as in the first game, but nonetheless acceptably lengthy.\n\nThe graphics are quite good, showing some age by now, but at least in runs well, high FPS. However, the camera is always restricted to look down a little, so you can’t tilt it up and enjoy the scenery in a more 1st person style, which is a shame. That restriction also sometimes doesn’t provide the best view for combat either. Though different equipment reflects visibly on the characters, there’s no way to view the full character close up and rotate it, like in a character screen. The HUD is somewhat simplistic, as are the indications above enemies, which at first makes it a bit difficult to understand what’s going on.\n\nThe soundtrack is quite good, mostly in the atmospheric orchestral style, aiding to that tone of grandeur lost, but with tense and epic combat sequences.\n","October 20, 2014","true","32.8"," 85 of 109 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","85","109","4","0"

Pick up a sword and start swinging it, you get better at using swords.  DS2 added classes, but kept specialties.  DS3 takes away almost all character customization by giving you four characters to choose from and a handful of points to spend each level.\n\nDS1's equipment system allowed anybody to use any equipment they had the stats for.  DS3 essentially drops different loot for each character.  This must have saved a lot on art assets but leads to some oddities, such as the witch-with-a-gun character only being able to wear stockings, not pants.\n\nThe only real upside to DS3 is that it's not a grindfest like the first two.  But this is mostly a side-effect of it just being a much smaller game, both in terms of length but also in terms of ambition and vision.","September 15, 2014","false","1.7"," 106 of 144 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","106","144","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bradleypariah/recommended/39160/","bradleypariah","bradleypariah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bradleypariah/","239 products in account","Try to imagine Obsidian's role-playing dialog system embedded into the console port of Diablo III.  In a nutshell, that's Dungeon Siege 3.\n\nYou'll notice that the majority of negative reviews on here can only be summed-up the way Machinima's Inside Gaming Daily recently described most haters' opinions. It goes something like, "I hate this pizza because it isn't a taco."  Granted, it isn't wise to change a franchise as much as Obsidian did here.  Many fans of DS1 and DS2 appear incapable of liking this game, and it seems a lot of them feel tricked out of their cash.  I'll mention their gripes here, however, to give a fair review, I don't want to just look at what DS3 *isn't*.  I want to review it based on its own merit. To be up front, I actually hated DS3 at first, but when I was looking for a co-op to play with my non-gamer wife, I took a second look at Dungeon Siege 3.  I found I had completely changed my perception of this game, because I changed my perception of its design choices, and it actually became one of my favorites of all time.\n\nDungeon Siege III is a gamepad-friendly isometric action RPG with local and online co-op.  While much more casual than its predecessors, there's still plenty of quests, hacking, slashing, shooting, magic, looting, upgrades, lore, and dialog - and when multiple players (online or off) are in a story conversation together, players can vote for their preferred responses to NPCs, albeit Player 1 has the final say.\nThere are four characters to choose from, and each delivers a different fighting style (melee, ranger, sniper, magician). Each character also has two "stances" to vary up their attack strengh, range, and/or speed.  Not to mention, the back story will also change, according to which hero you've selected.\n\nGone is the tactical pause.  Gone is the squad management.  Gone are the skill points you earn, specific to your fighting style.  Gone are the multiple skill trees for each character.  Each weapon and piece of armor you find can only be equipped by a specific character.  Obsidian has "streamlined" this game, effectively consolizing it.  This is the heart of Dungeon Siege 2 fans' complaints, besides multiplayer camera controls and multiplayer inventory management.  You now will be only upgrading a single skill tree for your character, which means close vs ranged combat will not award skill toward that specific stance. Instead of holding down on right-click to attack, you'll button-mash, and each press will be one swing/shot. Also annoying to some, even when you gain NPC followers, you will not be in charge of their tactics, nor their upgrades.\n\nThis game was developed by the same people who made South Park: The Stick of Truth, Fallout: New Vegas, Knights of the Old Republic 2, Neverwinter Nights 2, and Alpha Protocol.  I loved all of those games.  My point, they KNOW role-playing.  In my opinion, the story here is great.  If you don't have nostalgia stars in your eyes, it's easy to see that the voice acting here is by far superior to its predecessors.  Although the story is drastically shorter, it's certainly more focused.\n\nAll in all, I can tell you this:  if you have a friend or loved one you want to play an immersive, open-world action RPG with while sitting on the couch together, this is the game. You'll find a rich story, a simple skill tree, upgrades, dialog choices, and tons of loot.  It's one of the best (and few) couch co-ops that delivers a true RPG experience.  Plus, gamers of all experience levels can enjoy it together.\nI come from a Fallout 3 background, but my wife is really only good at Bejewelled and racing games.  While I was able to try to craftfully master my character's moves, she was able to button-mash with a rifle-wielding hottie from a distance, and we made an excellent team!  We were able to hack/slash/loot our way all the way through the campaign +DLC together and we both had a blast.  If you've ever played/enjoyed Diablo 3 or Daggerdale on the couch with friends and/or family, and you like the idea of breaking up the action with cutscenes and dialog choices once in a while, I'm telling you, this really is an awesome game.\n\nIf you're looking for the next 100-hour tactical RPG in the Dungeon Siege universe, buyer beware.","November 28, 2014","true","35.1"," 68 of 92 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","68","92","3","0"

What can I say? I don't like writing negative reviews but, well... Let's just say this game is FAR below my expectations.\n\nLet me start by saying that I have been a DIEHARD fan of the first two Dungeon Siege games. Those two games - Dungeon Siege II in particular - were a very nice, fun, and more light-hearted action RPG break away from my long-standing Diablo II obsession at that time. The first two games were pretty much Diablo clones, at least in terms of overall gameplay - point and click mechanics and the usual hack, slash, loot - wash, rinse, repeat routine, and I was very much okay with that.\n\nSo what's up with Dungeon Siege III? It's NOTHING like the first two games. I was so excited when I first learned that a new Dungeon Siege game was in the works, but after it was released, I read not-so-good reviews of the PC version in particular and after finally getting around to acquiring it myself to try and give it a fair shake, I was left shrugging my shoulders with a head-scratching "huh???"\n\nObsidian has essentially "console-ized" Dungeon Siege III. Kinda felt like a slap in the face to us longtime fans of the first two games - Dungeon Siege has always been a PC game, and the console focus of this installment made it not much fun at all. It doesn't even come close to feeling like the previous games. No more point and click mechanics, the character movement is now relegated to the usual WASD suspects on the keyboard. I figured since they "console-ized" this game, I'd pull out the Xbox 360 controller and try to approach it that way, maybe I'll enjoy it more, but no dice.\n\nI can't stand the inventory management - it really would've been nice if they could've revamped it for the PC to be more like the first two games. I'm not a fan of the overall character management/leveling system either. Again, this is NOTHING like the original Dungeon Siege games.\n\nThe Dungeon Siege games were never very strong on story, so I wasn't expecting much in that regard. However, I've had such a hard time enjoying this game to get anywhere nearly far enough into it to fairly judge where Obsidian went with it. But as far as I can tell, they at least stayed true to some of the base lore in the earlier games.\n\nI can't recommend this game. Sad as it makes me to have to badmouth a Dungeon Siege game, I just really wish they would've stuck to the tried-and-true formula. It's a shame, and I can only hope that someday, Obsidian - or any other good RPG game developer, for that matter - makes a Dungeon Siege IV that will return to the original PC-based point and click, hack n' slash approach.","December 30, 2015","false","5.6"," 36 of 46 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","36","46","0","0"

And although this was my first Dungeon Siege, I can honestly say I immensely enjoy this game. I loved how I could actually control my character's movements instead of just clicking on some part of the map and wait for them to get there. It makes me feel more involved. Also, the combat was absolutely great and at times a great challenge. The abilities the four hero's have were all fun to use, and they each felt different from the other's. Something that really impressed me was that when you change any part of your armor, so too did your character. I do not tend to see my character's look change with other RPG games like this one, so it was just nice to see something as simple as this being implemented.\n\nNow, despite what I said, I still have faults with the game. I have to agree with many others when saying that camera was a pain at times. It was too close to the player, and at times it made me feel constricted. However, is the camera beyond awful and ruin the whole game? No, not even close. I also would find myself getting stuck in objects towards the later levels for some reason. I would be walking then uh oh, I am now stuck in a log, or what have you. I also see many complain about the confusing skill tree, clunky AI, bad controls, and for some reason picking up objects. I really do not understand their complaints because one: the skill is so simple to use. You literally choose what ability you want(only certain levels let you pick an ability), where you want your proficiency, and what talent you want. It is so straight forward. As for the AI, I have never had a problem. My companion was always helpful ( I have not played co-op) and never felt useless, and the enemies were not mindless oafs. I also thought the controls were just fine. There was nothing confusing about them (I played keyboard and mouse). And picking up objects? Really? If there are a lot of items near you, press ctrl. You now just picked up everything. No reason for that to be a struggle.\n\nIf this is your first Dungeon Siege game (because apparently this is not worthy of being called a Dungeon Siege), or if you like action RPGs, I recommend this game. It is beautiful, addictive, and the story is actually pretty awesome. I got hooked with it and felt really involved in it. It really is a solid gaming experience, and I wish more people could see that. I also recommend getting the DLC as well. Raises level cap, grants enchanting weapons and armor, and adds a good lengthy and engaging mission. The game is great and I highly recommend picking this one up.\n","May 11, 2014","true","13.1"," 39 of 54 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","39","54","0","0"

I found the game enjoyable as an action RPG-lite style game in a vein similar to the Overlord series, Dragon Age II, and perhaps Trine. Think Gauntlet and you'll be on the right track. Its a decent bit of cartoonish fantasy fun that works better with a gamepad than the traditional keyboard and mouse setup. The game features a dialogue/choice system similar to Bioware's. It's not quite as fleshed out, but not quite as pointless either. Decisions you make are neither good nor bad, just different, and will effect how things carry forth from the point they are made. With the excellent Treasure of the Sun DLC the entire game clocked in at 20 hours for the first play through including all but a few side quests.

The problem it has is its name. This is no Dungeon Siege!\n\nObsidian/Square Enix would've been better off by giving this child a different name, or make it a Spin-off (like it happend with Baldurs Gate back then. PS2 version was called Dark Alliance). This would've been alot better and the die hard fans of Dungeon Siege 2 wouldn't have been dissappointed that much. Especially when considering that they made this game with consoles in mind. The Port is bad. Crappy and slow UI, plays best with a controller and so on. Performance is good though.\n\nAnyways, in terms of Action-RPGs, Dungeon Siege 3 is not bad. It has its flaws, yes, but overall it's good enough to be picked up by fans of the genre. Especially at a discounted price.\nIt features good graphics, a decent story with multiple choice stuff, okay-ish combat with dodge mechanics and a nice lootsystem which keeps the good loot coming until the end. The companion system they used in the game felt kind of good too. They weren't annoying and could stand their ground on their own. They even pick up gold drops for you.\n\nThe biggest problem this game has, is its lack of bigger maps. It's mostly a really long tunnel... and I mean really long. It's on par with FF13. There is not much exploration going on and this is especially bad when you reach Stonebridge (the games Mainhub/Town). It doesn't feel like a Town at all.\nWhere the game kind of got it right was with the Treasure of the Sun DLC. Here it actually feels like you are running around on a big map with ways to explore it. Still a longshot away from being called an open world, but it felt satisfying to run around in the Desert. The DLC introduced a few new/nice Puzzle-/Dungeonmechanics as well.\n\nSo getting the DLC with the game should be a no-brainer.\n\nBut I don't recommend picking it up at the current price. 20 bucks for the Game+DLC is too much. 10 bucks at most seems about right.\n\nAll in all I'd rate it with 7/10. So definetly recommended to fans of the genre.\n\n","April 13, 2014","true","16.6"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","28","37","0","0"

And one of the systems I enjoyed most was apparently only in the game because I bought the DLC, so that's another half-strike.\n\nI don't know whether to praise or damn this game. It's seriously some kind of limbo-state. Very controller-centric action RPG gameplay, probably one of the worst co-op setups I've seen in ages off of consoles (only the host keeps gear/save data/XP! ♥♥♥♥ you, other guy! don't go trying to bring your character up in here!), but then it adapts some of my favorite quirks of the genre (story choices and actions in-game giving you perma-perks to stats, controllable evolutions of skills, solid amount of customization for your characters within their roles).\n\nIf you buy this: buy it with the Treasures of the Sun DLC. You may as well - the game's a bit short, and TotS gives you some cool new toys and a rather fun new region. Just know going in that the game is not amazing by any standards. On the other hand, it doesn't really ♥♥♥♥ UP anywhere that I can point out, either.\n\nI still don't know how the hell I feel about this, and I've been debating it with myself for about a week now as I played it to completion.","August 12, 2013","true","15.4"," 54 of 83 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","54","83","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingherod81/recommended/39160/","kingherod81","Arkan01d","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingherod81/","718 products in account","Did you enjoy Dungeon Siege 1 or 2? Do you like action rpg's like Diablo or Torchlight?  Or you even enjoyed the D&D lite Bauldur's Gate version for console? If you answered yes to any of these questions then don't buy this game.\n\nWhat DS3 does is a disgrace to aRPG's. What's so strange is it from Obsidian, one of my favorite developers. How they messed this up so badly is beyond my comprehension. Let me point out a few of the flaws.\n\nCONTROLS - In all aRPG's the left mouse button moves your character around, attacks enemies that are highlighted, and picks up loot. In DS3 the left mouse is the attack key only. It's basically what most games have set as shift+attack since when you press it you stop what you're doing and preform an attack no matter if there's an enemy or not. Moving is the right mouse button. The move button does not attack at all. Picking up items is the 'E' key. Yup, they took one simplistic function and divided it into 3 buttons that will confuse and frustrate you. That's just one example of how badly they messed up the control scheme here.\n\nCHARACTER - Character development should be an important aspect of any RPG. You are presented with 4 different characters to choose from, all with different abilities, and a decent back story. So in the beginning you're thining you'll be able to develop and grow this person. Nope. Firstly, you are not allowed to zoom in on your character for a close-up look. When you get new weapons and armor their apperance changes, but you can never really get the feel of how much more badass you are. Combine that with the worst inventory management system I've seen in 10 or more years. You are never allowed to view your character in an inventory screen and see good your new loot looks. And if that wasn't enough, when you interact with other characters in the game you are only ever shown the other person's face. Basically once you choose your avatar, and begin the game, you will never be allowed to relate to them again. Match that with a talent tree that doesn't give you a choice as to what to develop. You are forced to unock all abilities in each tier.\n\nGRAPHICS - There is one major problem here. Peoples eyes look like they are dead. Everyone's eyes in this game is slightly whited out and it seriously feels like they are the eyes of the deceased. Also a problem is the UI. I mentioned some of it with the inventory, but the UI is just bad all around. Not to mention your characters abilities icons aren't very good. They don't do a good job at representing what each ability does.\n\nSAVE POINTS - Really!? Save points in a game!? It's the 21st century is there anyway we could have just moved past this? Was it in Square Enix's contract to publish this game it had to have Save Points instead of an auto-save feature, check points, manual save? Oh, and when you do save; instead of just selecting the save slot, you must first select the save slot you want and then you have to actually go to the bottom of the screen and press the save button. An unnecessary step and only further points out the bad programing decisions that were made in this games development.\n\nMULTIPLAYER - Last but certainly not least is MP. You do not bring your avatar into a MP session. You are only allowed to play as one of the Hosts NPC buddies. Yes, playing with friends means you do nothing more than waste your time while your friend gets to complete the game. Which leads me to my final complaint...\n\nAI - You unlock NPC's in the game that help out on quests. Basically they're the pets of most aRPG's. Except the pets of most aRPG's are vastly better programmed than these human counterparts. They wander around in combat, barely helping at all. In fact, this game would have faired better if they had just not included them. IMHO it feels like they were behind on development and the team never got around to actually fleshing the NPC's out.\n\nPros - From all that badness there is some good. The story is well written and developed. Voice acting is good. Game runs well.","June 4, 2013","false","1.8"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","1"

I thought the story was fantastic and you have multiple branching paths like choosing your own adventure books.  Much like you would find in a Dragon Age or The Elder Scrolls title.  The game can be quite difficult at times too.  Difficulty spikes throughout the game.  You may down a boss within a few minutes, but getting to the boss you may come close to death more than a few times from trash mobs.  Treasures of the Sun DLC is highly recommended and has quite a lot to offer.  Level cap +5, enchanting, more story and the option to respec your skills!!!\n\nDS3 isn't like DS1 or DS2 in the regard of open world ARPG's, but still does a good job in the genre nonetheless.  There are save points everywhere in this game so if you do forget to save your last save shouldn't be far behind.  I do wish the respec pool for your abilities was easier to do.  You'll have to backtrack and traverse through areas again just to get to the town that offers this.  Buying new gear from merchants was way overpriced so buying from them was never an option for me.  By the time I made it to the last boss my gear was pretty good anyway, but I did end up having an excess of gold by that time too.\n\nOn the fence about whether you'd like this or not?  Like I stated above.  If you're into choose your own adventures like Dragon Age/Oblivion, but in ARPG form this game is for you.  DLC recommended.  Well written and very fun.

Definitely a really good game. Four playable classes, my fav being the mage because he has cool looking spells like clockwork bombs. I have beaten the game with him and the entire game was awesome. Now I am playing the dlc Treasures of the Sun with my gunner. The gunner can switch between a rifle and dual wielded weapons that include a one handed shotgun and pistol and she has some really powerful skills. The fighter chick can summon a fire dog to help and the warrior is pretty self explanatory with some good skills also. The voice acting is very good and the game has memorable sound effects. The mouth movement actually matches the words in most cases in cut scenes. That's some pretty good detail for a top-down action game. The music is superb and always fitting of the place and mood. The graphics are really very good and hold up very well even by today's standards. The best thing about the game is its unique combat system. You get two sets of weapons with three skills each, and you can hold right trigger to activate more powerful versions of your spells or hold left trigger to activate healing and defensive skills. Obviously I play with a xbox 360 controller and it actually works very well because otherwise I would never even consider using a controller for a isometric game.

Its linear making it a no brainer to get around, the graphics are decent, the moves your characters can do have impact and flourish to them, and the environments and enemies are all well thought out and interesting.\n\nThe story is actually pretty good, and even the side quests you can do can end in different ways, since you can make choices that literally alter how parts of the game will play out, and if you get certain perks or not. Which adds to the replayability of the game. You can go back and make different choices the next time around, and even have a different partner to see their different dialogues during the times you can make interactive choices.\n\nThe real weaknesses in this game stem from a high difficutly and learning curve, some cheap boss battles that you must figure out what to do right away or get pounded into the ground, and the VERY boring loot you receive, alongside a sometimes terrible partner AI that will stand there and watch you get your skull caved in from a safe distance..\n\nThe difficulty spikes up a huge amount if you choose to play as the melee character in the game. It takes alot of manuevering and quite a bit of use of the block and roll buttons even to survive a standard encounter on normal difficulty, even when your partner isn't being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nSome boss fights come up suddenly with little warning, and unless you figure out their patterns pretty fast, they are going to absolutely crush you into the ground within' seconds. You need to quickly figure out what moves can be blocked, and what you have to avoid, because if you don't get ready to reload your save. Yes it adds to the challenge of the game, but some instances and some of the bosses almost require you to die once or twice just to figure out what you were supposed to be doing. Some of the fights for when you actually get to them are straight up unfair with the gear and skills you've acquired on your journey, and if you are playing on hard, get ready to get one or two shot, there is NO room for error in the boss fight on the higher diffculty.\n\nThen after all that, what do you get? A ton of garbage drops, a handful of cash, and a long walk back to turn the quest in, just to get a perk or a halfway decent item or money reward, sometimes not even that. Sure you get a ton of loot in the game, but most of it is boring and much of the same. Alot of the stats have no in game description and you literally need to look up a guide to figure out the meaning of the stats on your equipment and what it actually does for you, since there is no in game indicator as to what the stats do.\n\nThe game has an interesting enemy roster, with a variety of environtments that usually force you to round them up in a large area or choke point so you can combat them effectivly. Even some of the standard enemies can wreck your life in a matter of seconds if you're screwing around. If you wanted a challenge this game can definitly serve it up, depending on the character you select, and which partner you decide to pair up with. The difficulty spikes down a bit IF you can actually find someone to play with online, or if you're playing with a friend who is willing to replace the sometimes brain dead AI.\n\nWhile it's a fun romp with actual decent dialogues and cool choices, I simply would not recommend picking it up unless it's on sale or part of a bundle with possibly the other games in the series or perhaps bundled with other square-enix games for CHEAP.","March 3, 2014","false","10.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I had happy memories of the original Dungeon Siege and Dungeon Siege II; so I was excited to play this to finish my collection as I always wanted it, but never got around to it.\n\n15 minutes in I was feeling sick. I mean, Dungeon Siege was always a generic fantasy setting but had a charming 1980's D&D feel. This was just so bland, and I dare say the Dungeon Siege movie was more visually inspired than this game.\n\nThe graphics look good at first, but the animations of the first NPC you run into is just cartoonish puppet looking and  uncanny valley at the same time.\n\nThe lipsync was terrible, the eyes of NPC's dead and souless. Combine this with lack luster voice acting...I just couldn't get invested.\n\nFirst impressions are important, and it did not impress, but I continued playing further. An hour in and I still found myself exiting the game to play something else because I was bored. I couldn't be hooked!\n\nHowever, the major killer of this game is the camera, damn thing is clunky when being adjusted. It also turns so fast and wildly around making you sick and is never in a tactical advantageous position.\n\nAlso seeing how Dragon Age Origins came out a couple years before Dungeon Siege III, I couldn't help but compare the two. The graphics, animation, gameplay, camera and interface was just lackluster compared to a simliar sword and sorcery fantasy RPG. It feels like a cheap product trying to lure in some of the same audience by the way they were marketing this game and hyping it.\n\nSome might say I have nostalgia glasses, but I have nothing against a game franchise trying out different styles so long as it's good or enjoyable. I got together some distant friends who were not familiar with the Dungeon Siege series, but were familiar with other RPG's or avid players and they too were unimpressed even as casual gamers.\n\nI later learned from a review by Ross Scott of Accursed Farms; that one of the key and unique features of Dungeon Siege, it's large party system which could include up to eight party members active at one time, was not present. Having bombastic large melee's was one of the most memorable and fun things about Dungeon Siege and it's gone. Well, that killed any chance of me picking up the game again.\n\nI uninstalled it and I wish I could delete it from my library.\n\nI don't even want my money back; I just don't want to remember owning or playing this.","December 25, 2015","false","1.0"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","13","18","2","0"

I can't have a clear opinion about you. No, wait. I have...\nFirst of all: Dungeon Siege I & (especially) Dungeon Siege II where one really big part of my gaming history while I was a kid, I loved them! So, I was really excited when I heard that a new "Dungeon Siege"-game will come out. But then I saw the negative reviews of how disappointed the people were... so I waited for a sale and grabbed it, with good conscience. The whole series only cost me 5 bucks - so I left out my daily dosis of coffee and pizza... nevermind.\n\nI started the game and thought... "yeah, ok. It's.. uhm.. different?" and this throughout the game. But let's see:\n...good was:\n\n++ that it was over...\n+ ...oh! and you can block and dodge now...\n+ ...a nice battle sytem (it's different)\n+ good graphics\n+ exceptable soundtrack\n...that's it...\n\nplease don't be mad, ok? But I can't find a mass of positve aspects. The problem is, that "DS I & II" are different... In a better way. "Dungeon Siege III" offers:\n\n- flat characters (sad biographies)\n- only 4 characters available\n- no "own" hero\n- horrible inventory\n- the story is mehh.. 08/15\n- "too" easy? (also on "legendary")\n- poopy endboss\n- dead multiplayer (with terrible camera)\n- it's pretty linear (no open-world, only elements)\n- bad level-design... similar to a long hallway\n- NPC's are too powerful...\n- ...often they aren't recognised by the enemies\n- it's NO Dungeon Siege!\n\nYeah... as you can see, it is not my game. Even if I played over 40 hours. But trust me, one big problem is, that I loved "DS I & II" but "DS III" is in comparison with those just... poop. You were able to play with more than just 2 guys in your group; it was open-world; the classic-inventory was there; you had your "own" hero, with your individual hair, skin, face and name! And not "Lucas" some kind of a knight... like this 2011-decal.\nI have nothing against a game franchise trying out different styles so long as it's good or enjoyable. I also asked other friends, who like RPG's (and didn't knew the "Dungeon Siege"-series) and they were also not impressed or interested in playin'.\n\nMaybe my review is so bad because I was guided by the other two parts, but let me tell you, that other RPG-games are more fun. So if you still decide to buy the "Dungeon Siege"-series, play "DS III" first - it has nothing to do with the other parts and you won't be disappointed. Only in comparison with the other two parts it feels pretty bad (sadly). If you also don't care for graphics, the other two parts are a good variety.\n\nDungeon Siege III - you are a solid game but can't keep up with your "older siblings". But you will not be disadvantaged.\nThat's why I give you 5/10 but still a negative review - I am sorry.\n\nPlease tell me your feel for the game with","March 30","false","44.3"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","14","20","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masteratt/recommended/39160/","masteratt","masteratt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masteratt/","290 products in account","Let me get out the way the most frequently mentioned points in the reviews:\nI have not played any previous Dungeon Siege title.\nI have played with a controller.\n\nCompleted on Very Hard in 17 hours in Single Player\n\nQuick Overview\nSo what got my intrigue about this game was the developer. I have always been a fan of Obsidian for the fact their RPGs are generally very well written, have great characters and lore and feature fun and active player choices. On those fronts, this game did not disappoint at all.\n\n\nIn more depth\n\nCompanionThe characters are well developed and your companion delivers the right amount of commentary during gameplay and during conversations to the point you appreciate them being there but also don't want them to just shut the hell up.\n\nThere is an 'Influence' tied in with each companion that allows powers to be unlocked if you fill the influence meter. The influence is gained by being a great leader to those companions in your actions and conversation tones. The companion I preferred (Lucas) was a diplomat and felt people should be heard and given a chance, before being cut in half, where as my starting companion had a much harsher and warrior like attitude.\n\nThis adds a nice level of depth already to the companion next to you, assuring that they are not just another icon on the map.\n\nCombatEnemy and location variety is great. I really enjoyed the pace in which you move from one area to another and the different enemies you face within. You are never in one area for too long, and this is coming from someone who did every side mission he could find. From elemental magic attacking enemies to long range bow to big towering tank like enemies. It's all there to test your skills.\n\nOne thing I will say against the combat is, playing as Katarina, a rifle and dual wield pistol packing badass woman, who fights from distance, the roll for me was very OP. The roll dodge basically puts you in a invincible frame state and the amount of 'cool down' before you can roll again is almost non existent. Some tougher fights can turn into a rolling game due to that but there is strategy in that you have to decide when to stop rolling and make an attack.\n\nThere is also the environment variety that can change and affect how you fight as some areas are tight, where as others have space to move around.\n\nStoryThe story is well realised and did not disappoint an Obsidian fan. Though not their most ground-breaking work; it's solid, well written and well told.\n\nIt really gets you thinking about power and how people gain it and hold on to it. And also why they want it in the first place. As with most Obsidian games, there is no clear good or bad. There is only intentions, inspirations, and actions. It's up to you as a member of The Legion, a great historic order who have been massacred and lost many, to decide many people's faith as that is the role of The Legion. It is also you who decides and helps decides how The Legion should rebuild itself. Do you face the ugly truths of the past or hide them to make The Legion appear a something greater than what it is?\n\nAs a member of The Legion, who historically decide on disputes of the land, it is your job to settle some disputes and call some of the shots. There range from a land ownership dispute to deciding the faith of an ex-Legion member who causes chaos to ultimately deciding what to do with the person you have been pursuing for the whole game and many more throughout your journey.\n\nYour decisions and the outcomes are explained in nicely drawn comic like pages, elaborating on the waves your decisions have made and perhaps how it was received by the public and the fellow Legion members. This is a nice way to acknowledge and feel the weight of your decision.\n\nGameplayIt might seem odd I have left gameplay for last but this is actually a fairly simple affair. Simple in its execution but done well and is addictive similarly to how a loot based ARPG games can get (think Diablo, Torchlight, etc). There is the three grades of items, many skills and proficiencies to pick and upgrade, many stats to think about, another upgrade system which is tied to 'mastering' the skill.\n\nYou have two sets of weapon sets, main and secondary. Main is usually your damage weapon and secondary is crowd control. Each weapon has three powers along with character based defensive powers. So it has most of the depth you would expect from such game and really I feel this is best experienced by playing the demo which you can get right here on Steam. I have mentioned the depth demo might not express in this little overview section.\n\nTo End...\nSo, overall, this is a very solid game in all its functions and I have thoroughly enjoyed my 17 hours with it.\n\nIt gets an overall;\n\nVERY GOOD\n7/10","July 31, 2015","true","17.0"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","21","35","0","0"

You choose one of four different character classes and begin an adventure to take back the nation of Ehb from an evil force that has gained control of the land and declared war on all of the former protectors of Ehb, known as leggionairies. The title has all the elements of a traditional roleplaying game with you, the player, gaining experience points through combat, completing quests and discovering lore. You use these points to upgrade your chosen characters abilities and gear to your particular style of play. Graphically the game is beautiful, it's played in a isometric top-down view much like "Diablo" and the "Baldur's Gate" titles. The environments are varied, colorful and full of the little details that one looks for in games of this type. Both the sound and musical score are excellent as well. I have to admit though that for some strange reason I remember downloading and playing the demo of this game right before it launched a few years ago and I did not like it. I can only believe that's because of my gaming habits having changed around that time and me moving more towards RPG's like "Skyrim" and "Kingdoms Of Amalur" and away from the old-school roleplaying games that first captured my interests in the genre to begin with.

That's not to say however, that it is a bad game, merely questionably named. DS3 drops most of the grinding and instead plays more like an action game. Loot and leveling still exist, but the emphasis is placed on the combat and story. The story isn't anything to write home about, but it's still significantly better than the first 2 games in the series, and most action RPGs in general. The combat is where this game shines, different weapon and skill combinations can accent any play style, and it's just flat out fun to play.

It just took me longer to get into the games story than I would have liked.  Four unique characters all having unique play styles, but all of which feel bland at first.  This tends to hold true for most of the game, whether its character or story telling, it starts off slow, gradually improving.\n\nThere is nothing ground breaking about the style presented, nothing new about killing for loot and moving on.  The level design left something to be desired, and the mini map was not very helpful at times, and certain stats were never quite explained without delving into the help section of the game.  The combat was fun, if not slow at first, as you learn to dodge and block and to use your two stances.  One for single enemy combat and the other for Groups.  This holds true to all four characters, even if they have vastly different abilities, they are still grouped into group or single combat.  The AI partner never bothered me and seemed to do thier job fairly well as the game progressed. There are also dialogue choices that affect your current companions "trust" in you, not as in depth as Mass Effect or other bioware games, but pretty alright.  You can also unlock "deeds" through this and completing certain tasks, which give permanent stat boosts, which I found rewarding.\n\nBy the end I found the story to be quite alright, envolving and engaging enough to feel rewarded after it was all said and done.  I ended up liking the character customization by the end, even if, like I said, it took awhile for the ball to get rolling.  All in all, a decent game, well worth any marked down price its given, and certainly not the worst hack n slash loot fest I've ever played by far.","March 15, 2014","true","47.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

I ended up having to replay the last bit cause I missed one of the achievements which kept me from getting the fully-win-the-game achievement. At some point I hope to play the other three characters, but I really liked Anjali so it might be a hard change.\n\nThere are quite a few interesting aspects in the game that I enjoyed. The skill selection process, for one, as well as the essences to add boosts to your character by way of weapons and armor. The multiplayer is certainly not the greatest, it would be if it didn't have a tethered camera. There is a way around this, but I am not desperate enough for a multiplayer to deal with adjusting the game by way of editing files.\n\nSo all in all, I would suggest buying this game to play solo. If you want it for the multiplayer aspect, I think I should say to skip it.\n\n\nEditEdit: I forgot to mention this is a linear game, meaning it follows a pretty solid track with no real free roam. I didn't find it bothersome, but some others might so I figured it should be thrown out there. :)","July 24, 2013","true","35.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Every skill used is colorful and bright and makes the combat really stand out. Making a critical ht is satisfying because it really stands out.  It makes you wonder why other developers are so afraid of having color in their games.\n\n+4 unique characters each with their own unique play style. Every character has 2 offensive stances used to either deal with single or groups of enemies and one defense stance. Each stance has 3 skills associated with it. Each skill has 2 way you can upgrade it, allowing you to customize how you want to develop your character. In addition each character has a passive skill tree further adding to your build. All of this leads to interesting builds.\n\n+The game play mechanics are a bit more unique to this type of game. In order to use your abilities you need force and the only way to gain force is to attack your enemies. Defensive skills use power spheres which fill up as you take damage. All of this creates some unique game play elements and changes the way you play and develop your character. Dodging and blocking also play an important role in game play,\n\n+You can always rely on Obsidian to craft a well thought out story.  The games side quests in some regards are even more interesting and creative than the main quest.  Books and lore are scattered around the world to further flesh out details if your into that sort of thing.\n\n+Music/sound and voice acting are all top notch.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-If there is one aspect of an action rpg that you need to get right it's the loot. The loot has to be exciting, it has to make you want to kill enemies to discover new items, it should feel rewarding. This game has non of that. The loot in this game is boring. For the most part, loot just changes stats and more likely than not you will equip the loot that gives you the highest stats. A good loot system means the player has to make tough choices, this game doesn't do that.\n\n-Multiplayer is all but dead meaning you are not going to get any achievements related to multiplayer. Even if you do play a multiplayer game you character progress is not saved if you join someone else's game when you go back to single player. How this even passed in today's time is mind boggling.\n\nConclusion\n\nI really loved this game, I played it many times on 360 and will continue to play it here. This game gets a lot of things right in regards to the genre sadly it also gets things horribly wrong as well.  I love that each character is really unique and no two characters play the same. Hopefully we see Obsidian get to make another with more improvements.\n","August 20, 2014","true","30.2"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

Me and a friend played it a lot, never finished it, but had fun with it nonetheless. Then the second game was released, didn't play it and don't really remember why. Although, it got excited back when this third game was announced - "Hell yeah, another game in this great series!". Imagine the disappointment when I first played DS3 and it was NOTHING like the first two games.\n\nWell, that was like three years ago that I last tried DS3 and it was on the Playstation 3. One strike right there. Well, I got the game in a Humble Bundle some months back and thought I'd give it another go and surprise, surprise, I actually had a lot of fun with the game.\n\nThe first two games were squad based tactical RPGs, this one you're only controlling one character and you've got one companion and it's more like a Diablo clone, more than anything else. Maybe you've grown tired of Diablo 2 or 3, Titan Quest, Path of Exile... whatever it may be, and you want another game to play for a few hours (with or without friends), give DS3 a go. One character may be completed in like 10 hours and there's four to choose from so in all reality, you could play this game for abour 40-50 hours if you choose to play with all the characters.\n\nAnyhow, I do recommend this game but that is if you get it for a maximum of €5.

But I never played those two games. I started with Dungeon Siege 3, and it's not really half bad. The combat can get stale and the looting isn't as enjoyable as say Diablo or Titan Quest, and if you buy the game with the Treasures of the Sun DLC you'll get powerful items that will easily carry you through the rest of the game. The redeeming value in this adventure is the story and its lore, but if you're not the kind of gamer that enjoys that sort of thing, then you can skip this one.\n\nFor me, I enjoyed trekking mindlessly from quest to quest (with zero exploration since you can summon a path with the press of a button) piecing together the game world and its history.\n\nI'd recommend it for someone seeking an easy RPG to play that's something other than Diablo.

Not a bad game in general, but it suffers greatly due to the fact that this game was made with consoles in mind.  Sure you can at least customize graphics (to a basic extent) but for some reason you cannot customize controls and the default keyboard mouse controls are just terrible.  Instead of having abilities 1-6 binded its 1-3 and you have to continually hit shift to switch to other abilities which basicly means you aren't going to be dodging or blocking (space) when you need to.  Plugged in a controller and suddenly everything made sense and I stopped dying every 2 seconds because i could actually play.  The decision making, combat and story are actually decent, all else aside.  Buy it for cheap, or just wait for Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2 if you like dungeon crawlers, and you might as well buy on console if you have one since the pc version is probably worse than it without a controller.","May 5, 2012","true","20.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I'm about halfway through the original campaign and halfway through the DLC but I have a good impression of the game, playing it solo on Hardcore all the way through.\n\nThe negativity for this game comes from people expecting a game much like it's predecessor(s), which yes; it is not. I have only played DS2 and though I would have liked a direct sequel that plays similar to the previous, I'm not disappointed with the result. I can write an essay on game franchises with sequels that changed things up and why it's not surprising they usually aren't well-received, but it's common sense really.. or should be. Anyway, the gist of 'these' games is to treat them on a separate level in the spirit of fairness.\n\nI'll go ahead and say that there's isn't really anything that stands out from the crowd. Graphics, Story etc. are all around the same level and more than decent but nothing out of the ordinary. Game options are sort of there but other than that, the game is pretty consolized. Moving around, basic combat and UI controls are designed with a controller in mind. Though you can use your mouse to navigate the menu, it feels off as for instance you can't click an item to view it's stats without directly equipping it, effectively disabling you from comparing it with others. In general, keyboard and mouse just doesn't feel nearly as good as playing with a controller.\n\nThat said; if you can get over the controls, there's really a good amount of fun and enjoyment to be had with this game. Quests are easy, tracked individually and the game shows you exactly where to go should you only ask. Even the puzzles you come across don't require much (if any) thought to solve. ..in other words, the main focus is pretty much the combat and character progression. It's not a hack and slash as it has a different pacing which often requires more tact / blocking or dodging.\n\nNot sure how it plays on Normal or less but I imagine the game becomes a walk in the park of casual fun. If however you don't want to be a scrub and join the hardcore folks, be forewarned because it is brutal, relentless and can be unforgiving at times. Aside from everything able to kill you in just a few hits, there are certain boss battles and segments in the game that can feel overwhelming to say the least. You may find yourself cursing at the screen and/or putting the blame on your friends/AI companion. Really, it sometimes feels like I'm playing Dark Souls as I found myself soldier through the same trash mobs over and over again just to die a horrible death in a seemingly unfair boss fight where one small mistake proved to be fatal. But as with Dark Souls, when you finally do get through; it feels very satisfying.. until, a moment later you come face to face with something just as bad if not worse. Nevertheless, I'm liking it very much.\n\nI think it's worth the current retail price. But as with most other games, if you're doubtful; just get it on a sale. There are games that truly deserve every bit of negativity, but DS3 is not one of them.","October 26, 2014","true","44.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Biggest plus is that they have a really good engine to work off of if Obsidian wanted to make a more robust and deep Dungeon Siege game. Hopefully spend some more money on writers that don't constantly say the whole name of the bad guy like a 1990's movie high school bully and good character artists, not the ones that draw giant breasts on everything.\n\nI got this for a few bucks on Humble Bundle.

I'm about halfway through the original campaign and halfway through the DLC but I have a good impression of the game, playing it solo on Hardcore all the way through.\n\nThe negativity for this game comes from people expecting a game much like it's predecessor(s), which yes; it is not. I have only played DS2 and though I would have liked a direct sequel that plays similar to the previous, I'm not disappointed with the result. I can write an essay on game franchises with sequels that changed things up and why it's not surprising they usually aren't well-received, but it's common sense really.. or should be. Anyway, the gist of 'these' games is to treat them on a separate level in the spirit of fairness.\n\nI'll go ahead and say that there's isn't really anything that stands out from the crowd. Graphics, Story etc. are all around the same level and more than decent but nothing out of the ordinary. Game options are sort of there but other than that, the game is pretty consolized. Moving around, basic combat and UI controls are designed with a controller in mind. Though you can use your mouse to navigate the menu, it feels off as for instance you can't click an item to view it's stats without directly equipping it, effectively disabling you from comparing it with others. In general, keyboard and mouse just doesn't feel nearly as good as playing with a controller.\n\nThat said; if you can get over the controls, there's really a good amount of fun and enjoyment to be had with this game. Quests are easy, tracked individually and the game shows you exactly where to go should you only ask. Even the puzzles you come across don't require much (if any) thought to solve. ..in other words, the main focus is pretty much the combat and character progression. It's not a hack and slash as it has a different pacing which often requires more tact / blocking or dodging.\n\nNot sure how it plays on Normal or less but I imagine the game becomes a walk in the park of casual fun. If however you don't want to be a scrub and join the hardcore folks, be forewarned because it is brutal, relentless and can be unforgiving at times. Aside from everything able to kill you in just a few hits, there are certain boss battles and segments in the game that can feel overwhelming to say the least. You may find yourself cursing at the screen and/or putting the blame on your friends/AI companion. Really, it sometimes feels like I'm playing Dark Souls as I found myself soldier through the same trash mobs over and over again just to die a horrible death in a seemingly unfair boss fight where one small mistake proved to be fatal. But as with Dark Souls, when you finally do get through; it feels very satisfying.. until, a moment later you come face to face with something just as bad if not worse. Nevertheless, I'm liking it very much.\n\nI think it's worth the current retail price. But as with most other games, if you're doubtful; just get it on a sale. There are games that truly deserve every bit of negativity, but DS3 is not one of them.","October 26, 2014","true","44.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was interesting, but way difficult at first. Basically, just hack and slash, run to the Light column to get "revigorated" and go back for more. Leveling was tedious, and the WIMP knight could not fight his way our of a paper bag. The girls, on balance had much easier time with mobs, albeit took a few weeks of same-ole hack and slash of the same old mobs to get levels and skills to an acceptablwe levels. LOOT sucks.  It is not always visable, get bounched to inaccessible areas, but usually not worth spending time to recover. Now, zones are locked until you complete certain quests or objectives,  STATS appear to be ambiguous, and gear is hard come-bye. you can not auto-pickup lot, but must click on it. Not sure if weight is a factor, but usually is in these games. Healing is readily available at the LIGHT collumns., but configuring the toons was SOOO  mysterious, with no readily available help, at least while I played. Someone said/posted there is a help file to guide in the config quagmire, but I never found it. So, after weeks, literally hundreds of hours, I got thru all four characters to the Boss. Each time you enter a NEW zone, it will auto-save, and you are locked in. You can NOT go back, you can not get out. SO it you are not upto the level of the mobs, you will lose. And while you can restart from previous zone save, it gets to be a real PIA after 10-15 re-tries. The biggest ♥♥♥♥♥, for me, is the FINAL savegame, after completion, got LOST or deleted, BUT NOT BY ME. So, this prevents me from accessing the DLC, paid for TY VM.,and it appears Steam disavows and responsibility. Trying again for the 15th time to REDO the Boss fight, it appears they gave the Old Boy some steroids, cause he wipes out BOTH of my best toons, repeatedly. Overall, the game is similar to the first two, but since you do not have any physical disks, must abide by Steam rules, and at the mercy of some server-in-the-Sky to maintain your files and saved games, it is barfely worth the 50% discount cost. This must be a Steam policy, as EQ, again paid for, got wiped and can't be played without some additional fees being paid, so I was told when I attempted to log in....The Community groups are great help, mostly. I recommend the game, if, ONLY IF, there is a 50% price reduo, and GET SOME HELP files. Having played these games for 25 years, or more, back to PM and Donkey Kong on Atari, OK, 35 years, I thought I had a decent idea of how it should go, but NOOO. It appears that some of the "special" skills or attributes are worthless, and don't work most of the time. Made HOT KEYA for all of those, but they are intermittent, That is, you takes your chances. In Boss fights, you do NOT have any time to recon, reconfig, or GUESS. They will cream you. It would be nice to have some healing Pots or some decent gear, but you can only get what you can scavenge. Cheats might help, but are against Steam policy. IF you are tenatious, persevere, keenly observant, and have the patience of JOB, (read that book sometime) like Gilgamesh, yo might just win.  It became really work to get past the fisrt Boss, the flame lady, as she is torqued and way out-classed my TWO tooms. And the dapper Gent is no gentleman.

The story's also a lot better than you'd expect, though it may not seem that way at first. Gameplay's a bit of a departure from the previous installments in the series (to say the least), but most changes are for the better, and the story connects back to the first game's much better than DS2's did.\n\nMy only major complaints are that the audio can be buggy at times, and some of the voice acting is what I will politely call less than stellar.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnHadley/recommended/39160/","JohnHadley","John Hadley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnHadley/","984 products in account","Dungeon Siege III is a solid, if not spectacular, linear action RPG.  The game does not really have anyhing to do with Dungeon Siege or Dungeon Siege II.  Its like someone took a totally different game and just wrote Dungeon Siege on it because they wanted a name that people had heard of before.  Here you only control one character and you only have one companion fighting with you at a time, not a party based affair like the previous DS games and you have little to no control over your companion.  Its more of a single character action adventure with a pet.  There is a variety of different equippable loot and different passive abilities to put points into so you have some minor character customization available, but not as much as you might like.  If you play it with no preconceptions it is fine as it is, but if you are expecting another Dungeon Siege you will be disappointed.\n\nThe storyline and combat action were adequate and I didn't notice a single bug in the whole time I played the game, which is very commendable these days.  The graphics seemed pretty nice, but the camera is a bit of an annoyance because it doesn't allow you to zoom far enough out so you often lose view of your enemies off screen while fighting.  I recommend a gamepad since the right stick can control the camera while you fight.  I can't imagine how you would do that if you play with a mouse and keyboard.  Anyhow, the game was designed for consoles so that should be the preferred method of control.  I don't think I could recommend this game if you don't have a gamepad.\n\nThe playtime of the game was adequate.  I'm guessing it takes around 20-30 hours total if you do all the side quests.  There's not a massive number of side quests so you won't get bogged down with them like in some other games, but they do add a few hours to the game.\n\nI bought the game for five dollars and I think it was a decent enough game for that price.  The game is not the best in its genre at anything it does, but if you get it in a bundle or find it on sale you can get a few days of reasonable entertainment out of it.  You aren't missing anything important if you don't ever play this, but this game is not horrible.\n","September 15, 2014","true","45.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

And there is no diablo like loot system or a goal where you try to get good gear to showing, use or trade with friends, in fact the coop option is truely limited, but those who log in are forced to stay in the same screen as the host, so no wandering off and they cannot bring their own characters, gear and so on. The only thing they can do is use a free character slot on the host. So they don't gain anything for the time they spend on it. At least not for their own campaign.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/subsanity/recommended/39160/","subsanity","joe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/subsanity/","445 products in account","As a Diablo-eque hack & slasher, Dungeon Siege III is far from the usual fare you've come to expect from Obsidian. While the game is fairly linear, where forks in the main path usually means loot chests or side missions, choices being reflected in the epilogue was a nice touch and a welcomed addition.\n\nInstead of building a party, you only control 1 character with 1 other character deployed as an AI companion. Combat involves mixing up the 9 skills, and their empowered variety; the stances switching and constant dodging reminded me a little of Bastion's combat.\n\nThe game is pretty and practically glitch-free. It is a shame that the beautiful character models were rarely showcased as the dialogue camera never panned over to your character, other than in the DLC. Other mild annoyances are the slow-ish walk speed and restrictive camera pitch.\n\nOne feature they did retain from the Dungeon Siege brand was the huge continuous world. It's quite amazing how the lack of loading screens can add to the enjoyment of a game.\n\nAll in all, I can understand why Dungeon Siege fans condemn it and others bemoan its "console dumb-down". Dungeon Siege III seems to suffer from the recent trend of being a decent game but also a "bad" entry in a franchise, however it should still be an enjoyable distraction for a budget price.\n\nNOTE: probably best played on a gamepad","September 23, 2013","true","21.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can choose from 4 solidly different characters.  The combat starts fairly simple (mash attach, use 1 or 2 abilities), but it gets more complex in a really rewarding way.  Each character has 2 combat stances, and each stance has 3 abilities that you get as you level up, plus 3 defensive abilities.  Each ability can also be mastered to unlock a more powerful version of that ability.  You get to distribute a few meaningful upgrades each time you level up.  The entire game was bug free for me in single player.  The graphics were really nice, and the plot was pretty solid (although as with most fantasy games I said "huh?!" a couple times).  The looting is good, the inventory and quest systems are good.  The game isn't incredibly long, but for me that was good.  It was about 9 hours for the single player and it really felt like an epic journey.  A few sidequests, but it wasn't bogged down with them.  As I ramble on, I realize that the bottom line for me was "this game was pretty awesome."   I am also a couple hours into the co-op.  Only the person hosting gets to save their character, but as long as you play with the same person, you'll both get to keep your stuff.  Co-op is mostly smooth, but since you have to both be on the same screen, sometimes your partner running off, gets you trapped in a corner.","March 14, 2013","true","14.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The boss battles in particular can be a slog (the final boss of the DLC in particular is just awful). The loot is boring, there is no exploration to speak of and the skills (at least for the class I played) were nothing special. So why would I still recommend this game? I was actually drawn in by the story. This is something that VERY rarely happens to me with video games but there is something about the setting and the interactive dialogue choices that really clicked with me here.

Combat is simple and straightforward, is fun and can keep you entertained throughout most of the game. It does tend to get a little repetitive at times, but swapping allies and changing equipment builds can help ease that. The part that's probably lacking the most is the story, which is the main focus of the game. The story isn't very original, the "cutscenes" are all flash animated paintings or drawings, hardly ever if at all do you get a close-up of the characters, giving an absence of connection with the story and characters in my opinion.

This game definitely doesn't pass as a Dungeon Siege game, the only thing that qualifies it is the lore that's in it (Which I think I gathered all but one piece of). It has many nerd-service moments, in which it refers back to the original game, and even some moments that refer to the second, but it's style is entirely different. I look at games for what they are, not what they should be. It's still a good game, full of great story-telling, and an alright Combat system. The Combat System could use a bit of work, and I would have liked some more companion interraction, but it was a different developer from the first two games, so first of all, you can't expect them to go all out like they would have. Second, people need to stop saying "It's not the same! It fails my professional inspection!" It was a bold move to go from a, well, I don't know what genre it is, but mostly mouse controlled, to a game that actually requires some thought into combat. The combat system is very situational, and quite challenging, I can say that in the last two games, the combat mostly depended on luck, and how geared out your characters were. This one depends on actual skill, with the gear of your characters... The learning curb is a bit off, seeing as how it went from disappointing cake-walk to frustrating fires of hell, but once you figure it out, it tends to be a rather well-thought-out system that actually levels up quite nice now that I think of it.\n\nFor those that couldn't pay attention to my horrible rant: It's not a Dungeon Siege game, though it has the lore of it. It's still a good game, for what it is. I highly recommend it.

Peole who were fond of early Bioware forays into consoles - KOTOR and Jade Empire, to be precise - would have loved it. It's built on the same design principles: incredibly well-paced story in a "choose your own adventure" form coupled with extremely linear level design. You won't find open world exporation, deep character customization, complex skill trees and full party management here - but it's not a bad thing, per se, since it allows to focus on a story while not being entirely devoid of gameplay.\n\nEven though there is no traditional party, the game features companion NPCs that double as pregen player characters. You can't control them in battle, but you can change their equipment and stance. You can't initiate conversation with them, but they have plenty of contextual banters and can disagree with your choices in conversations. All four are fully voiced.\n\nStory is lighter and less prone to deconstruction than certain earlier Obsidian titles. There is a fantasy trope subversion here and there, but most of the time the setting is treated with respect. This is a welcome change for me, but undoubtedly those who wanted it edgier were left disappointed. George Ziets was creative lead on both this and Mask of the Betrayer NWN 2 expansion, so they share much of the atmosphere.\n\nStarting levels suffer from being incredibly bland traditional fantasy, but later areas - both Stonebridge and Tumbledown Court - are excellent each in their own way, with great NPC casts and unique ambience.\n\nGameplay wise it's your run off-the-mill ARPG. Once you get your twitch going, it flows smoothly. Makes you wish the corridors weren't so narrow, the trash mobs - so numerous, and small time bosses - such obvious damage sponges. Otherwise it gets the job of carrying you from dialog to dialog done.

That said, if you like this type of game then give it a shot.  It's relatively well finished and mostly balanced (some issues introduced with expansion).  Not a lot of replay value and no higher difficulty reruns (like in DS2).\n\nThe leveling up system allows SOME customization, but at the end you unlock all of the skills.  You can customize individual abilities for special effects, but after you find the core skills for your play style and max them out, it becomes a chore to level up.\n\nOnly get the expansion for this if you got it in the bundle (which I don't like because it doesnt have the expansion for DS2).","July 20, 2015","true","22.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game's firs check point doesn't even occur after you choose a character and spawn in.\nA little further down this path there is the estate you are traveling to. A save checkpoint ok not too bad I guess. Ten minutes later after entering the estate and having my first encounter and first "task" given by another I quit out to get something to eat.\nCome back to it? I'm way back at the beginning of entering the estate... lol wtf?\nI'm not a big fan of the controls. In fact they're so borked I'm not even gonna try and describe them.  Suffice to say it's not a typical HnS ARPG where you highlight somethign with the mouse and then attack it. You have to actually have the character facing it. This means you have to hold down MMB constantly in a fight.  Strafing is worthless because it's not actually strafing. Pressing left or right "strafe" actually faces and moves your character to the left or right. It's a right-left movement key. Not a true strafe.\nThe only game series to get third person right was the first two Batman games.\nWaste of money even at five bucks for the franchise pack.

Most buggy games seem to be somewhat forgivable because they have fun elements, but this game had absolutely none.  The game is incredibly linear (occasionally there is a single path branching off the main path, but these are rare and short).  The camera angle is terrible on the PC - I find myself fighting 50% of my enemies off screen.  I routinely cast fire jackal just so that it can show me what direction my enemies are.  Your characters are tightly tethered together so that all battles feel like three-legged races.  If you try to move right while your buddy is moving left, too bad!  The both of you will end up struggling to move but going nowhere while the big boss rains damage down upon you.  This sense of being joined at the hip continues even when just trying to maneuver through the dungeon.  Because of the terrible mechanism for moving about (on the pc), one of you will likely get stuck on a door jam or stair banister.  When this happens, you will not be able to move to walk around the obstacle because your buddy will likely have already traveled too far.  They then have to come back to get you!\n\nBattles can be especially frustrating as you find yourself mashing keys over and over again just to make some effect take place.  This leads to a strange bug that occurs occasionally in battle for the fighter characters and almost routinely for spell casting characters.  Normally, when casting a spell, a button is pressed and while that button is held down the cursor becomes a blue glowing ball that you are supposed to use to aim the spell.  When you release the key press, the spell is cast and your cursor returns.  At least, that's how it is supposed to work.  Routinely in battle our spell caster would get slaughtered because releasing the key press didn't cast the spell - instead the blue glowing ball whizzes around the battle field and until it decides to go away on its own the spell caster cannot move at all.  But don't think that playing the fighter characters will be much better.  Because you have to spin the camera in order to aim at your enemy, I routinely find myself attacking thin air while someone beats me from behind during the 5 seconds it takes to do a 180.  Theoretically this can be solved by placing your cursor precisely on your enemy, but I find that near impossible while a group of enemies swarms me.  There finally came a point where I realized that I had not enjoyed a single moment of this game and decided to never play it again (despite reaching what I think is the final battle).\n","January 2, 2014","false","21.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It also isn't hard to make your character OP to the point where the game ceases to be fun in the slightest. My advice? If you're looking for a good dungeon crawler, this isn't it.

I have played maybe 10 minutes of this game, and I will not waste anymore of my time on it.\n\nI am angry enough that Dungeon Siege 1 and 2 are not multiplayer-able in Steam (someone should definitely be locked up for that, all by itself). Dungeon Siege 3 was a marketing lie. Lock this guy up. He had done some careless, selfish things with his merchandise, and should be slapped. I don't care how many people on here say, "Der, this is not like DS 1 and 2, but-but-but... it's the best game I've ever played! It's an amazing ARPG!!" --- Baloney and cheese, that's what that is.\n\nHe failed, and should not get any attention. He should care more about his audience and gamers than this. He deserves the failure he received from trying to make a "console" game, and not being faithful to his gamers and followers he had.

It was an amazing game; a seemingly wide-open world, amazing levels of customization, and tough, too.\n\nThis game is a console port. The inventory system is optimized for console controllers (ie no grid system any more), the controls are built for a controller (ie to my knowledge, there's no strafe functionality, so if you want to strafe, you've got to use your mouse and stop attacking), and the skill system is simplistic enough for console controllers (ie no depth).\n\nThe game quickly deviates from the Dungeon Siege format. Instead of being able to build a character that does what YOU want with the ability to mix and match abilities, you get to pick from four pre-made characters. If something doesn't fit your fancy, well you can go screw yourself. What do you think this is, Dungeon Siege? ... Wait... Combat is MUCH more focused on positioning and fast-paced movement, where in earlier games movement was much more tactical and positioning was a little less relevant. The skill system is bland and uninteresting, not really letting you build characters like you could before. Oh, and your character can only use three skills at a time. Two stance abilities and a guard one.\n\nSpeaking of the stances... The game has what I can only describe as a stance system. You hit "q" to switch between two stances per character. One of the characters switches between double pistols and... a rile? shotgun? It's been a while since I've played her. Another switches between using a staff and spitting out fireballs. There's no customizing that, either. Each stance has one ability tied to it, and you have to be in that stance to use that ability. The ability use button (1) is right above the stance change button (q), so I often found myself switching stances instad of using the ability I wanted to.\n\nOne last thing that I want to harp on: the bounding boxes for terrain do not match up with their visuals half the time. I often found myself trying to walk into completely open spaces only to find myself unable to, because the stairs that were four feet away really had a bounding box there, or the cliff that was behind me was wrapping around in from of me somehow, or I was anywhere near rocks. For a game that relies so much on quick movement, you want to go NOWHERE near the rocks. They're devious traps set by the enemies to trap you and leave you helpless.\n\nEssentially, this game is not a DS game. It's a bad attempt at a third party of cashing in on the name brand, and a sloppy game even on its own. Stay away.","January 23, 2015","false","7.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I was surprised that I was drawn in as much as I was, however, and certainly not for the reason I expected. The combat is honestly pretty boring and tedious especially later on. The boss battles in particular can be a slog (the final boss of the DLC in particular is just awful). The loot is boring, there is no exploration to speak of and the skills (at least for the class I played) were nothing special. So why would I still recommend this game? I was actually drawn in by the story. This is something that VERY rarely happens to me with video games but there is something about the setting and the interactive dialogue choices that really clicked with me here. Would I recommend this to just anyone?

Combat is simple and straightforward, is fun and can keep you entertained throughout most of the game. It does tend to get a little repetitive at times, but swapping allies and changing equipment builds can help ease that. The part that's probably lacking the most is the story, which is the main focus of the game. The story isn't very original, the "cutscenes" are all flash animated paintings or drawings, hardly ever if at all do you get a close-up of the characters, giving an absence of connection with the story and characters in my opinion.

This game definitely doesn't pass as a Dungeon Siege game, the only thing that qualifies it is the lore that's in it (Which I think I gathered all but one piece of). It has many nerd-service moments, in which it refers back to the original game, and even some moments that refer to the second, but it's style is entirely different. I look at games for what they are, not what they should be. It's still a good game, full of great story-telling, and an alright Combat system. The Combat System could use a bit of work, and I would have liked some more companion interraction, but it was a different developer from the first two games, so first of all, you can't expect them to go all out like they would have. Second, people need to stop saying "It's not the same! It fails my professional inspection!" It was a bold move to go from a, well, I don't know what genre it is, but mostly mouse controlled, to a game that actually requires some thought into combat. The combat system is very situational, and quite challenging, I can say that in the last two games, the combat mostly depended on luck, and how geared out your characters were. This one depends on actual skill, with the gear of your characters... The learning curb is a bit off, seeing as how it went from disappointing cake-walk to frustrating fires of hell, but once you figure it out, it tends to be a rather well-thought-out system that actually levels up quite nice now that I think of it.\n\nFor those that couldn't pay attention to my horrible rant: It's not a Dungeon Siege game, though it has the lore of it. It's still a good game, for what it is. I highly recommend it.

Peole who were fond of early Bioware forays into consoles - KOTOR and Jade Empire, to be precise - would have loved it. It's built on the same design principles: incredibly well-paced story in a "choose your own adventure" form coupled with extremely linear level design. You won't find open world exporation, deep character customization, complex skill trees and full party management here - but it's not a bad thing, per se, since it allows to focus on a story while not being entirely devoid of gameplay.\n\nEven though there is no traditional party, the game features companion NPCs that double as pregen player characters. You can't control them in battle, but you can change their equipment and stance. You can't initiate conversation with them, but they have plenty of contextual banters and can disagree with your choices in conversations. All four are fully voiced.\n\nStory is lighter and less prone to deconstruction than certain earlier Obsidian titles. There is a fantasy trope subversion here and there, but most of the time the setting is treated with respect. This is a welcome change for me, but undoubtedly those who wanted it edgier were left disappointed. George Ziets was creative lead on both this and Mask of the Betrayer NWN 2 expansion, so they share much of the atmosphere.\n\nStarting levels suffer from being incredibly bland traditional fantasy, but later areas - both Stonebridge and Tumbledown Court - are excellent each in their own way, with great NPC casts and unique ambience.\n\nGameplay wise it's your run off-the-mill ARPG. Once you get your twitch going, it flows smoothly. Makes you wish the corridors weren't so narrow, the trash mobs - so numerous, and small time bosses - such obvious damage sponges. Otherwise it gets the job of carrying you from dialog to dialog done.

This game was designed to bring DS to console (which was a mistake for the franchise IMO).  Controls are simplified and there is no more party tactics playstyle and very little character customization (beyond choosing your gear).  That said, if you like this type of game then give it a shot.  It's relatively well finished and mostly balanced (some issues introduced with expansion).  Not a lot of replay value and no higher difficulty reruns (like in DS2).\n\nThe leveling up system allows SOME customization, but at the end you unlock all of the skills.  You can customize individual abilities for special effects, but after you find the core skills for your play style and max them out, it becomes a chore to level up.\n\nOnly get the expansion for this if you got it in the bundle (which I don't like because it doesnt have the expansion for DS2).","July 20, 2015","true","22.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But for those who are looking for a cooperative adventure, don't come here. The coop mode in this game is completely useless, you come in as kind of like a placeholder for the companion you have in the single player. You dont gain levels, or loot, or anything of value, its a one-sided help to the host. The story is decent enough to continue to play for a while, but because of the fact that dungeon crawlers are lonely by nature, the game loses luster unless you are completely commited to the game.

Clearly the story has been worked on: there seem to be quite a lot of content there. But it's wasted by the lack of choices. This is an action game before it's a RPG, and it shows: killing is your only argument and you'll then be given an choice from the unconditionnal surrender of your enemy (it gets too repetitive not to be ridiculus). Can't expect too much from a game in which all stats are combat related, and it is better than a completely linear story, just not by much.\n\nBut then again, this could still be a pretty darn good action game right? Well...\nThe camera controls are among the worst I've ever seen. If you play co-op like me, there's simply no choice: you have to install the command line and tweak them into something playable (it'll still be pretty bad, but at least it'll be playable). I also recommend the command line if you play in hardcore, because otherwise your damage output is too low and it takes forever to kill anything (it doesn't make things less challenging, just less boring).\nI had to start a new game because I started with Lucas, the melee character, and it became apparent that my damage was so low it wasn't worth hitting enemies and blocking (although it's very effective) was useless because I didn't have any 'taunt' skill.\n\nCombat is repetitive. I've seen this game compared to Diablo, with people not understanding how the two games are similar. Well, Diablo's combat (considered very repetitive by many) is LESS repetitive than this game's, and there's a simple reason for that: in Diablo, your character's skills make your gameplay vary, making you want to level up to get new mechanics. In comparison, DS III would actually benefit from not having levels, as very few skills introduce new mechanics. Indeed, it would have been better to put the skills on equipement, which is otherwise just a collection of numbers (there's no unique effects) added to your character's attack.\n\nThe simple combat mechanics of the game aren't too bad though, just don't play if you don't have a controller. There's just one attack button (with a 3 attacks loop), no combo system, a nice dodge system (by far the best part of this game, IMHO). The two stances mechanic was a good attempt at varying the gameplay, but it's ruined by the loot system: if you get a good item for one stance, the other becomes pretty much useless.\n\nI'm not sure the game was play tested for its gameplay, as we found ourselves with way too much money effortlessly and yet nothing to spend it on, despite having bad equipement.\nThe only bug we encountered (a door preventing the main character from going to the boss room, effectively blocking any progress until we cheated our way in) was caused by the camera tweak, so I don't have any complain there.","August 24, 2015","false","16.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I cannot explain how entertaining the game was. almost every aspect was memorable and turned the game into one of my all time favs. At the time DS3 was set for release and I could not contain my enthusiasm. However oddly enough I COMPLETELY forgot about it. about a year and a half later I pick it up from gamestop for right around 18 bucks and began playing what was my first experience with a series changing sequel. I leave it at that because I still like this game INCREDIBLY. It is by no means the horrid game people make it out to be. It just has no similarity to the original series, which has since become famous among old-school dungeon crawlers. But honestly this game has very little competition other than a few huge titles(Diablo 3, torchlight). If you seem interested by the type of game this presents itself as and stumble upon it during a sale I could not insist any more than I already do to buy this game. It has an interesting storyline and fun combat/ co-op system. The only flaw in this game is it's including of side quests, as each level is linear and the side quests consist of either backtracking to fight a freshly spawned enemy or checking every room for an item. if these can be forgiven than the game will earn your respect\n7.7/10","April 23, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I played this (on normal) for around 8hrs, and was level 11, completing as far as I know all of the side quests and getting to the end of Act I.\n\n\nGraphics\n@@@@@\n\nThe game is about three years old, but Titan Quest is older, but looks much better. Nice enough, but nothing special. There is a gamma setup, but I think its more to annoy you - making get stuck on the scenery to add to its difficulty.\n\n\nMaps\n@@@@\n\nThe area's seem varied enough, but oh my god is it bad in how its presented. All ARPGs are huge open maps that are basically mazes, with natural terrain to force you to backtrack as required, but using these dead ends as boss encounters or hidden chest areas. In DS3, you are in a series of corridors. I am nearly having a panic attack as I play this game, its so claustrophobic.\n\nThe map is beyond woeful. Imagine trying to navigate from Lands End to John o Groats with your map that looks like a small circle with a line going from South to North. That's what your map looks like. Sometimes its a little wiggly, but its basically a line. You can change the zoom once, or you can remove the map. There is no overall map and no map overlay of the area and no adjustable zoom to be of any use at all. Quest markers lead you to think that you are heading in the right place, but are miles away from where you think they are.\n\n\nMobs\n@@@@\n\nYou get swarmed a lot, and need very early on to perfect the hit, roll, hit, roll, hit, roll technique if you don't want to be dead. I am not sure why you can roll faster than you can run, nor why just about EVERYTHING can run faster than you to swarm you as they run down the corridor, sorry I mean through the dense forest that is so overgrown apart from the perfectly manicured path.\n\nMobs are a little samey, bandits and spiders so far, but the Boss mobs and encounters have had some interesting attacks.\n\n\n\nSkill Tree, UI & Classes\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n\nLets start with the UI. Basic is the word, and nothing is contextual, meaning you have to wonder what on earth the empty orb things are that appear to be un-learnt skills are as no little pop up box helpfully appears.\n\nThe Skill section is something else. I am still not entirely sure what the Proficiencies do, as I think they only work when you expend your focus with your Ability 1 button (normally 1) You then change Stance to do something else and while in this stance, the 1 button does something different, but 4 always heals and 5 always does the other buff spell....its simply too confusing, when other games would allow you to use the orbs as you wish. Its reported to be a console port and one that has had no PC love at all. It shows.\n\nThere is a nice balance on the active skills, as you can only rank them to 5 in total and you have two choices per skill, so you can have 3/2 or 0/5 as you wish. Filling all 5 'empowers' the skill, meaning it now has a more powerful effect - multiple targets instead of one or heal all the party rather than just you.\n\nYou get Passive skills as well, which are normally based on x% per rank.\n\nLeveling is quite annoying though, it waits for the second you have finished a fight then goes to the character screen. So you cannot find a save point, then level and test a skill or anything. Its just annoying - like running into a wall.\n\n\n\n\nControls & Camera\n@@@@@@@@@@@\n\nRight click move and left click fire as usual, but you also have forward and back and lefty/right camera angles. You need them as well, as getting stuck on scenery happens a lot, getting stuck in corners happens in swarms and thats why I think the dodge roll was added. Spacebar adds a block move, while space and move rolls on that direction.\n\nThe camera is a mad thing that sweeps in and out at a moments notice. Nothing becomes see through, solid objects block its viewpoint, and boss fights in a room can see you looking at the floor a few feet in front of you as the camera changes without you doing anything.\n\nYou cannot direct your team members at all. Not with their spell choices or when to do anything. They do revive you if you fall, but forget directing them at the boss or the boss's minions, depending on your strategy.\n\nYou cannot click on targets to switch - it seem to be locked to the last one you attacked and you will contain to shoot the one miles away that you first started attacking while another beats you to death at close range. This is VERY annoying during the big boss fights, as you are shooting backwards and hitting barrels and chairs rather than your intended target.\n\nControls are not responsive either. There have been plenty of times when I have had to mash a button to get the heal to work (and I had enough foucs to use) and sometimes the roll dodge causes you to stand still and blck instead of roll, and as you are ALWAYS doing this, you are always facing the wrong way to block something.\n\n\n\n\nLoot\n@@@\n\nLoads of it, which is nice, and you can upgrade your weapons with essences you find.\n\n\n\nGameplay\n@@@@@\n\n\nOn one hand its all a bit meh! to be fair, while on the other so frustrating its beyond belief. At the end of act one you have a BIG boss fight that takes place in a tiny room. In single player, you can do nothing but fire off a quick ranged attack, then roll twice, then fire off an attack, then roll twice.....all aggro is on you all the time as you let your AI partner fight the boss and you just run away. If you miss a beat, she does so much damage that you lose half your hits in one go, and her she fires something off that takes away the other half. You have to roll as this is quicker than running, and if you dont roll she (as everyone else) runs 200% of your speed and chops your face off. If your AI party member drops in combat, you have no chance to revive her as you cannot get far enough away to spend the few seconds required to get her up again, and.....I wont say anymore about the fight, but it gets worse.\n\nThis is not difficulty levels being too high, this is being hampered by game mechanics that are just ♥♥♥♥. Camera angles, confined space and mechanics all together. Take the Dragon in Torchlight - now that was a rock hard fight, and while running and kiting is a sound mechanic, that felt brilliant. This? Nah. I have tried and failed a dozen times now, but with pretty much all of the above rantings going against it already, I should go back to Assassins Creed II and finish that off.","May 11, 2014","false","7.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I cannot explain how entertaining the game was. almost every aspect was memorable and turned the game into one of my all time favs. At the time DS3 was set for release and I could not contain my enthusiasm. However oddly enough I COMPLETELY forgot about it. about a year and a half later I pick it up from gamestop for right around 18 bucks and began playing what was my first experience with a series changing sequel. I leave it at that because I still like this game INCREDIBLY. It is by no means the horrid game people make it out to be. It just has no similarity to the original series, which has since become famous among old-school dungeon crawlers. But honestly this game has very little competition other than a few huge titles(Diablo 3, torchlight). If you seem interested by the type of game this presents itself as and stumble upon it during a sale I could not insist any more than I already do to buy this game. It has an interesting storyline and fun combat/ co-op system. The only flaw in this game is it's including of side quests, as each level is linear and the side quests consist of either backtracking to fight a freshly spawned enemy or checking every room for an item. if these can be forgiven than the game will earn your respect\n7.7/10","April 23, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Both of those games are miles and miles above this one in all avenues from the leveling/skill systems to the way the game works.  Having set classes and even a distinct lack of character customization really makes this game feel like they took the world and the name but not the actual game its self and improved upon it.  It really is a shame since DS1 and 2 are imo some of the best tactcal/Action based RPGs of all time.   I remember when the first game was released and they used the seemingly endless no loading screen technology for the first time.  It blew me away that i could move from one point to another with out having to load and that i could complete the entire game with out a single load screen.  Moving down into a dungeon felt like it had real depth and the same went for DS2.\n\nIf you are looking for a decent RPG then this is an alright game, but if you are expecting the dungeon siege expience look elsewhere.","August 8, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This feels nothing like it's predecessors.  That said, it isn't a purely horrible game, just not the sequel we were looking for and nothing amazing in its own right.\n\nThe game world we get is pretty linear (which the others were somewhat, but a decent amount of ARPG exploration was introduced in the second game) with little to find off the beaten path.\n\nCharacter building is simple, as skill choice isn't immensely important and works out to about 1.5 builds per character type (so not much replayability within a character type).  In previous games, we had skill choice mixed with a variety of spell choices you could equip at leisure (but, still had particular types that were affected by the skills).\n\nParty building, a feature that was pretty much a signature of the Dungeon Siege series, has been reduced to 2 characters at a time (which, if memory serves, was at least 4 in the other games).  They have introduced some interaction between characters as well as their liking or disliking your choices, but not with much depth (I barely noticed it).\n\nVisuals were actually really nice, especially on Anjali (who looks so awesome in archon form or with late-game armor, you feel a bit underwhelming as the other characters).  I gotta admit that.\n\nCombat was pretty fun too.  They've set up each character to have two types of combat stances, and switching between them can actually make for some versatile combat (and does allow you to make your build more interesting).\n\nItems are somewhat varied.  You find a lot of class-specific stuff, though (actually, I think most of it was).  You find a decent amount, but don't upgrade them extremely often.  Some people like that, some people don't; up to you.\n\nThe story works but isn't extremely memorable.  That said, you see more if it and of your characters than in previous games.  So, better!\n\nQuests are pretty standard, but some do offer a degree of choice.  Again, not to a degree that makes it special, but it is a nice addition.\n\nThe Bottom Line\nThe game isn't horrible, or even bad.  I CAN recommend it, because it can be some good fun.  Just don't expect anything amazing and pretend this is called Journey Into Dungeons or something (and is not part of the Dungeon Siege series) and you should have a good time.  It does very little that is special, but doesn't do things that are overtly wrong either.  It is a solid experience, but I couldn't bring myself to replay it.\n\nThe Good\n+ Nice Visuals\n+ Fun Combat\n+ General Simplicity (if you like that sort of thing)\n\nThe Bad\n- Small parties\n- Linear world\n- General Simplicity (if you don't like that sort of thing)\n\nEverything else is just plain neutral.","August 14, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Well that throws the mindless fighting out the window. Now I have to pay attention to what people say and go where they tell me -- or work out where the heck they want me to go. Loot drops constantly but it's never realy clear why one item should be chosen over the other, unless the numbers are significantly higher. Costumes never appear to be anything more than palette swaps and remixes of the initial outfit your character comes with. Thus, depending on who's playing, all enemies change the useless clothing which they carry in their pockets to suit who's coming to kill them. How nice!

Yes, I thought the interface was somewhat frustrating.  But the story was awesome, and games with random equipment of a zillion combinations are almost necessary to me.  The camera swirling around was kind of annoying, plus using the keyboard and mi♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ keys on occasion was too.  But heck, you are killing some pretty scary monsters, so I figure the dubious interface helps model the fact that we aren't all level 30 warriors with super agility.\n\nI did have to cheat a bit to beat the tougher bosses, that is look up which techniques work well.  Which is good, the game's difficulty was appropriate for me.  I would recommend this game to RPG fans, but suggest a demo if you are picky about camera views and so on.\n\nComparing this to DS I and II - I liked the story line better, but the interface was kind of sketchy as noted.  I felt more like I was following the character around from behind, as opposed to DS1 and DS2 where it seemed you were overhead like a god of some sort.","August 23, 2014","true","118.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For example, you get to make decisions such as letting someone live and that may benefit you or not later on.\n\nWhile I could complete the game on medium with a keyboard, a controller would have been far better as I rarely used the block function anyway.\n\nWhat the game has going for it is a nice colour palette, satisfying combat and a deep system to customise your character's skills and equipment rules. I also love is that there is next to no time for loading between areas and thankfully this game doesn't bother with a checkpoint system.\n\nWhere it falls is that the character's aren't that interesting. I played as Anjali who is a fire being of some kind. Yet her dialogue options were just dull. Now there are some funny lines from some of the characters so you will get a jolt of humour or two.\n\nAlso the AI of your partner can be annoying at times as you have no control over it. When your character gets knocked out, your partner can you revive you. Now you'd think that your partner would make it their priority to get you back on your feet. Wrong. Some times they will but sometimes they'll just mess about, doing their thing until either they finally come over or they die. Furthermore, if there's 4 characters, why can you only have 1 partner. Surely the mission to save the world (yup, no points for plot originality) would be better served with 4 peeps rather than 2.\n\nFinding your objective can also be tricky, especially with multiple levels of height in areas. Then there's the inventory system which while ok could be worked better. It takes time to get all 3 other partners but you can start getting their stuff from the get go. Stuff that only 1 person can use. Carrying it seems like a waste of space so there will be a ruthless amount of selling to be done.\n\nOn the whole my experience with this game was positive. As mentioned above there's tons of loot, good enemy variety, interesting enemy variety and the world comes across as having depth. Eventually I will try a second character so replayability as well.\n\nRegards\n\nOn the whole though, my experience with this game was positive.","December 1, 2013","true","39.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It does take some pratice to work the camera and hotkeys properly, but once you do it is easy to enjoy the game. I played as Katarina my first time through and had no problems once I figured everything out. The more melee style characters may be more difficult. I was definitely more disappointed with DS2.

Nothing at all. If you were expecting a party-based Diablolike, you won't find it. Obsidian took DS3 in a totally different direction. The random loot/mobs has been watered down, the control over your party's development has been watered down, your ability to control your party itself has been limited, and your progression and potential has been reworked into linear specialization of your basic skills.\n\nWhen you get over the shock of realizing you're playing a game that's NOT really a DS title, you realize the game stands well on its own. It has a certain charm in the combat, the characters are credible and engaging, and the story is interesting. DS3 should be approached more like The Last Remnant and less like Diablo. Play it for the story and you won't be disappointed... even if the lack of character customization and the limited progression choices hamper replay value.\n\nWorth checking out the demo before hitting the Buy button.","June 22, 2011","true","15.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I could change the camera angle, I played it with a controller, there were actual cutscenes with dialog not just text bubbles, my character talked!  My companions were the other heroes I didn't pick.  I got to shape the world depending on my actions (kill or save a guy, free or imprison another guy, etc) so it had replayability and your choices mattered.  The classes were fun, I played the chick with the gun.  Cool abilities.  Cool story.  The game had different endings.  It's really worth playing and I enjoyed it much more than Diablo 3.

Satsfying combat mechanics, realistic plotline, fast paced and generally fun to play. The main downside in this game is the lack of variation, the relative short playtime until completion and generally doesn't honor the epic lands as they were depicted in DS1 or 2.

Let me just start by saying that i probable have player more than 80 % of Square Enix tittles and i love their games so much!\n\nGraphics/Art: The graphics are smooth and the game is optimized well so it can play on older devices aswell. The enviroment is very good (not the best) but very enjoyable and the cutscenes are awesome aswell. There ae not much to be said about the raphics of the games, but certainly it is a big improvment from its predecessors. Soundtracks help you get in the mood of action as they feature a medieval/action/epic rythm.\n\nPlot: The storyline was very good and interesting. As a classic RPG you have to complete quests to move on through the game. Those quests can be main storyline or substory quests. In general there is nothing hard about getting the flow of the game as it is very specific on what you have to do and where you have to go. You dont really have to search around for what you have to do, you just follow the indicator. In general for a fan oof the series its a very satisfying game as you even explore and area directly related from the first game of the series which is awesome if youve been there before!\n\nGameplay: As a classic RPG you have the overwatch camera where you see a fixed amount of map and you character which is a little bit annoying because you would get a whole new experiense if you had a different camera. The movement is simple and so are the attack patterns. Each player has 2 combat modes that that one focuses on single target attacks and the other focuses on AOE attacks. Each mode has different skills and abilities. In general the gameplay is interesting and intense some times as the game on the hard difficulty is very hard, almost impossible to complete and the only way of doing so is by playing online with other 3 players. Each boss you fight offers you a different experiense as you have to play by a specific way to defeat each. In general each character offers you a very different experiense, defensive / offensive or close range / ranged attacks.\n\nIf you get this game at a daily offer its a pretty sweet deal in my opinion.\n","February 7, 2015","true","15.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However the bit of time I have spent on this game I really did enjoy it the game didn't feel like I was grinding my way to the end but rather enjoying a story as I progressed in the game. Which made the game even more fun to play but one thing that the game is not forgiving about is the lack of starting tutorials now while this might be due to the fact I started in coop rather than solo it left me trying to really figure out all the odd controls. Once I figured it out though I was rolling along without too much trouble. Well worth getting if the price is right for you just for the story and looks alone this game is worth it and should be considered when you buy it.","September 1, 2013","true","14.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Honestly, I don't. This is going to be one of those short-ish reviews because, and I am sincere when I say this, there isn't a ton to say about this game that would be unique. I'm mostly going to focus on the actual in-game mechanics and aspects. I didn't play Multiplayer because, well, there is no one to play with. AFAIK, multiplayer is client-side, so you join other people's games and play as their characters and the dialogue system works in that you choose different choices and thus' you can agree/disagree with each other on what to do. It's like a voting system, I think.\n\nMusic : It's got some amazingly atmospheric and fitting music, as well as high quality. That's all I can say without spluring my opinionated juices all over it. You want calm forest music with birds chipping and(at least, what I heard) crickets cricketing? Well, ♥♥♥♥, you got it. You want a creepy humming sound when in an abandoned haunted house? You got it! You want a mix of both when in the mines of a now-extinct race? Sure! For reference, go look up Stonebridge City's music. It's a perfect representation of music that fits and makes you feel "into it".\n\nStory : The game isn't really that short, according to my 22.2 hrs on record which is the fully utilized time in-game, including the DLC. So, the story itself, you ask? It was... Eh? Mediocre? Alright? Without spoiling anything, it's about the remnants of an ancient sect of an army of a long-destroyed  empire trying to fight back against a church-crazy angelic messenger. That's only the slight shortening of it. All-in-all, the story drags on a bit both because you move slowly and because it's kind of easy ot understand straight away.\n\nGameplay : Okay, this is where it gets kind of long and slightly "That's just, like, your opinion, man!" so a lot of people might disagree. I'd say that the combat / gameplay is basically Torchlight 1 / 2 but way faster-paced and with no delay between "turns" aka you constantly attack and have to be aware of your enemies. It's similar to Lord of the Rings : War in the North in that way. You can dodge, and it actually matters whether not you dodge, too. Especially with bullets and arrows which both move differently (bullets in a straight line, and arrows arch meaning you won't get hit if you continuously move albeit you sacrifice attacking back) as well as melee enemies. E.g. Certain enemies that lunge / jumpa at you and are unavoidable unless you dodge out of the way. Now, the thing with the dodging is that it *literally* gives you invincibility frames for the time of your dodging, meaning you can go straight through a magical missile attack (the most common champion/boss attack, to be honest) and be hurt for no damage. This makes blocking irrelevant aka USELESS, which is why using equipment that puts up block is, well, a waste of equipment.\n\nGraphics : This is obligatory by today's standards but, well, here it goes. It's got pretty good graphics for how well it runs on my computer, and my computer is ♥♥♥♥. I had to run it on normal settings and it still looked amazing. Of course, the female models have your generic sexualized-esque shapely figures but I'm not one to complain. Katarina's clothing is generally stockings and corsets/loosely fitting blouses, so take that as you will. Lucas, the main tank-knight character is the ONLY person I don't like because he looks odd. It's like the default mass effect Shepard models odd. It just looks very badly done. If you're expecting a lot out of the graphics, it's no crisis or suped-up Bethesda game graphics. Don't expect a lot.\n\nCompanion System : I made this its own individual section because, honestly, talking about companion systems is important. Video game developers NEED to flesh them out if they're going to do them correctly, romance or no romance(which this game is the latter). The companion system works similar to Dragon Age Origins in that you get "a point" on your companion's like bar relationship bar(Sure, let's go with that!) whenever you say somethin they agree with. The, suprisingly happy, part about this is that you don't lose points if they don't agree with you, meaning that decision you make in dialogue effectively serve to ONLY give you points towards companion acceptance. However, this system itself only serves to add to a bonus-stat system within the game. The "deeds". Specifically, the companions each have their own "deed" to give to you per relationship level you get them to (1 per character, but you can only realistically get one to level 3, so choose wisely or balance it out, I'd choose one) and offers +X towards a stat e.g. +5 stamina. Oh, you thought there's more? No, that's it. That's literally it.  You can't even talk to your companions, they just occasionally jump in to say something when exploring or when they agree with you in conversations. This is something that developers need to work upon because this game could've had an amazing Dragon Age/Mass Effect companion system. Anjali specifically as she's amazing idea for a character and whenever she jumps in on conversations, she has hints of a hot(haha I'm so punny...?) personality in the makings.\n\nI may be the only person to actually care enough to make a legitimate review of this game. This game has the same curse as Dragon Age 2. Don't come in expecting a carbon-copy sequel to Dungeon Siege 1/2. Go in expecting a quick-paced Action-RPG that was clearly made to be, well, new. It is a great time-killer game in its own right. It's just not the Dungeon Siege game you were looking for. Perhaps wait for the remake, if it ever happens.","February 10","true","22.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

However, i am a fan of the genre of dungeon crawler. If you are not then you need not buy this game. It follows the path of every Dungeon game that has come before it. For those that are you find a very well polished experience. The graphics are sharp, the gameplay is standard, and the story intriguing. My only complaint would be the somewhat unbalanced form the 4 players you choose from have. The knight and the ranger are your best choice, and your only choice is you play alone. If you desire to play the other 2 characters. Then you need to be in a party as they are more geared toward helping, or assist party members than stand alone ones. Although this game is aimed toward multi play it shouldnt be neccasary. Complaint aside i enjoyed my time, and look foward to completeing this game again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/guzicamoja/recommended/39160/","guzicamoja","Vedran","http://steamcommunity.com/id/guzicamoja/","31 products in account","Lots of folks giving it negative review because it doesn't resemble the previous DS games. True, this game is vastly different then anything before. This however isn't a good argument to give this game a bad review, I even prefer games that try out something new, even if it means completely changing the game mechanics.\n\nThat being said, the current game has horrendous character controls, took me forever to figure out how to interact properly in combat. Lot of combat abilities used require of you to point your mouse in the direction you want them cast. In a bigger fight, with lots of mobs and numerous particle effects I'd constantly kept losing sight of pointer and would end up casting stuff in direction where there were no mobs or only a few of them. Quite frustrating. Too many stats and too generic gear that made gearing up so frustrating and a huge waste of time.\n\nGame storyline, while having an interesting backbone, appears to have been written by a 12 year old. While it was interesting to revisit some of the locations from original DS, the NPCs and playable characters & companions are so bleak with robot like interactions that made each convo in the game extremely cringy. You're also given an illusion of choice through dialogue, but in reality the development of events in the game aren't affected at all. These 'choices' only affect the final cutscene after you finish the game and 'influence' you gain with your companions (give you some small passive stat boosting perk).\n\nNow, a few things I did like is that game went in another direction. Completely revamped, you no longer drag entire army with you, instead you duo the game with one of 3 companions you get. Each companion/playable character is unique and has vastly different abilities from the other 3. This makes for an interesting experience, trying to figure out which combo is best for your play style. Also each char has two different stances, usually one for single mob fights (boss fights usually) and one for group pulls. Game also introduces transmuting and essences, which allow you to mend your gear and add one of 5 possible stats to your gear (costs a bit, but usually worth it, especially in final act of the storyline).\n\nMy final score for the game would be 2.5 out of 5, though you could say I'm biased. I really loved the original DS, but the 3rd installment as a standalone game isn't an RPG at all but a quickly made hack n slash, and not a good one.","August 26, 2015","false","66.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"

Anyone who played Dragon Age Origin and then played Dragon Age II would immediately realize that a game that is built to be big, beautiful and content intensive should be put on pc only. Dragon Age II's epic failure proved why DA II should've been on PC. This game, in an attempt to please the console players (like DA II), is a port that failed to provided the mentioned contents, that PC players would otherwise expect.

I am highly annoyed that this is a console port, and would be a great game if not for my expectation of what a Dungeon Siege title should be.\n\nThe multiplayer is more like Fable 2 than your typical dungeon crawler. You could even compare it to Hunter: The Reckoning or Marvel Ultimate Alliance. The biggest weakness here is really that the camera locks your team into a small area of movement on screen while enemies will spawn and attack outside of it.

Its not like the previous games, it has issues, and the PC port has its own issues. Still, I would tenetively recommend it. If you can get past quality of life issues, there is a solid basis here. It feels rushed honestly, this seems like it was almost an excellent game. It took me about 19.5 hours to beat everything with one character, first run.\n\nThe plot is good, with exceptionally well written dialogue and interesting characters. It brings to mind a much larger lore and makes the world feel like it retains a lot of mysteries. You always feel like you are playing someone important, regardless of the character you choose. The different sections all feel a bit too unrelated though. It comes toghether, but your actions in each area mostly only serve the story of that area.\n\nGraphically the game is still attractive 4 years since its release. Character models in particular look very nice. Though the selection of armors available is a bit small. The locations are diverse and all interesting, each with their own palette.\n\nCombat is pretty good, your character has a small set of abilities to use, 3 each in 3 different stances. Every one of them is useful, and you can customize them further with special character talents and proficiencies. The basics of combat are nice, with attacks building up your bar for special abilities. Special abilities and taking damage build up a bar used for enhanced specials and support abilities. This keeps you engaging enemies and rewards being active. There are a few viable ways to play each character, and each of them feels unique.\n\nThere are downsides. The stats are a bit confusing, you will probably need to look online to see exactly what stats like 'warding' or 'retribution' do. This adds a bit of confusion to already rather dull loot, you will pick up a lot of items, but nothing is exciting. Its just more damage, more defense or more of one of the 'chaos' proc effects. Your AI partner holds their own okay, they make decent, if incosistent use of their abilities. However, when they need to revive you its a crapshoot, sometimes they run into an enemy, or stand in a pit of fire trying in vein to run towards your corpse.\n\nThe biggest issues the game has are all minor anoyances. Many, many minor annoyances. The UI was clearly designed for consoles, and while you can click through the menus, they are really inefficient at displaying information. Bizzarely, if you open up the equipment menu with the F key (or any other shortcutted menu) you cannot return to the main character menu, you have to manually exit out and then open it with its own hotkey. The movement and camera can also be a bit strange, and several times I was killed when I became stuck in a corner or an ability didn't activate. It also takes some finger juggling to activate your enhanced abilities, holding shift and punching in a number takes some getting used to. I never bothered with an enhanced support ability, but I suppose that would be space+shift+[1,2 or3]. Finally, and absolutely most confusingly, there only a minimap on your HUD, no dedicated maps. This is probably the biggest single problem I had with the game, and it makes finding your way to certain quests a guessing game until you figure out everything's locations.\n\nOverall dungeon siege III is a game that hurts from a transition to consoles. Even so, there is fun to be had, and I enjoyed it enough that I would recommend it to those who can ignore some rough spots. The game feels rushed, but the ideas behind it are solid, as is the story. I know this installment did not sell well, but I would like to see it built upon for a future release.","June 12, 2015","true","49.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The setting is good, the skill system is lacking. Slightly above mediocre, give it a try.\n\nDungeon Siege 3 is an odd one. It got more to do with the first DS game than DS2 ever did, and at the same time, has almost nothing of what made us love those two games.\n\nFirst of all, DS3 is set in Ebh several decades after the Seck incursion from the first game. DS3 contain enough tidbits of lore to make this connection plausible, and you even visit several places from the original game. It seems to me that Obsidian took care to tie DS3 in with the first game, unlike DS2, which is set on another part of Aranna. The plot revolves around events and characters related to the 10th Legion (which founded the Kingdom of Ebh in the first game).\n\nThe story is alright, even if character development and backstory is a bit wonky. All the player characters are desendants of the 10th Legion (almost all of them, at least), but I feel Obsidian could have fleshed out this part better, or even added  more information into the game. I felt especially one of the party members could've gotten a better backstory. She was interesting to be sure, but Obsidian did not act on it.\n\nGraphics and performance for a four years old game is good. The visual effects from attacks, spells and powers look pretty good.\n\nI got two major gripes with Dungeon Siege 3:\n\n- The party system:\n\nYou can only have two party members at any given time. You and one of the other three. Even if you can switch whenever you like, it simply isn't a Dungeon Siege game without the possibility of a large party. To make this even more irritating, the other two companions that you don't bring along is nowhere to be found. At least they could wait for you at the HQ or something, but no, they are *with* your party, without being there.\n\n- Skills, powers and (lack of) spells:\n\nThe original DS had no powers, only regular attacks and a huge amount spells. DS2 fleshed out this system significantly, with fewer spells but a load of powers for each class, which greatly improved replayability and customization. DS3 removed all spells. Instead, each of the four classes got 9 powers/abilities (the mage abilites look like spells, at least) tied to a "focus bar". Each ability have two additional improvements which you choose on level up.\n\nWhat we are left with, is a system with minimal customization, 9 powers for each character, several of those which are almost identical, and not a lot of reason to replay the game. Too bad. It gets a bit old when you use the same two or three powers throughout the entire game. Reinhart Manx is one of the most powerful party members, but for a mage, his arsenal of powers is somewhat lacking.\n\nAll in all, I liked the game, but it could have been so much more. It's cheap, give it a try.\n\nEdit: Finished the DLC as well. It is actually surprisingly good, and worth buying. Adds a higher level cap, a whole new area (Aranoi desert) and a good storyline. Not the longest DLC ever, but it gives you a few hours of fun.","June 15, 2015","true","32.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It's just pretty average.\n\nThe only thing in common with DS1/DS2 is the name. The game is quite different.\n\nPrevious game had more freedom for building characters, more options and more spells.\nHere every character has a fixed role and althought they can have 2 different modes with different skills, the mages in previous version has a lot more spells avaible.\n\nDS1-2: click on a monster until it's dead.\nDS3: smash buttons until the monster is dead.\nThe number of options during fights are limited and the AI can be pretty dumb at some time.\nThe ennemy attacks only the player, it never focuses on the frendly AI. I died a lot because of this concentrated fire on me.\n\nEquipment: in this game, the stuff you find almost always give bonus to some stats and penalities to others. Mostly because of this, most of the stuff I've found was garbage and felt like a waste of time to gather it.\n\nConclusion: it is worth a try if you can get it in a bundle with DS1 AND DS2.

The original Dungeon Siege franchise used to be a party based, hack/slash game that focused on highly customizable character and party selections;  however, the latest installment was a blatant clone of the Diablo franchise, without the strengths that Diablo has. While it is still a strong installment, it does not live up to the expectations or any of the potential that the release had.\n\nThe main problem is that the game play was far easier than any prior Dungeon Siege or Diablo game, and only had a few difficult parts.  While the character's health was generally low and you can only define Katarina as "squishy," the dodging function was exceptionally overpowered.  Once I got a good tempo while playing Katarina, I spent more time dodging than anything else. Due to the game's auto-target system, it was exceptionally easy to dodge, dodge, face in the general direction of your target, shoot, dodge.  While this removed most, if not all, of the difficulty of the game, it added a level of difficulty created by the pure frustration of changing targets.  Once the game selected a target, it was usually counter productive to attempt to change to a more desirable target than it was to simply kill all the least desirable targets to get to your intended target.\n\nThe second issue was that the story was completely unengaging.\n\nThe UI was cumbersome, and counterintuitive.\n\nFinally, the exact way stats affected your character were never defined, leaving the power gamer in me screaming for satisfaction.\n\nIt's a clear step-down from the original Dungeon Sieges in almost every way, but it is very similar to the Diablo franchise now. The original Dungeon Sieges were hack/slashes, but were party based and unique enough to stand apart.  If you don't have some other game to occupy your time, DS3 is an awesome game. However, don't go in expecting something comparable to DS 1 or 2. Expect another Diablo clone and while it is a pretty good clone, no clone is comparable to the original.","June 28, 2013","true","11.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Once the game selected a target, it was usually counter productive to attempt to change to a more desirable target than it was to simply kill all the least desirable targets to get to your intended target.\n\nThe second issue was that the story was completely unengaging.\n\nThe UI was cumbersome, and counterintuitive.\n\nFinally, the exact way stats affected your character were never defined, leaving the power gamer in me screaming for satisfaction.\n\nIt's a clear step-down from the original Dungeon Sieges in almost every way, but it is very similar to the Diablo franchise now. The original Dungeon Sieges were hack/slashes, but were party based and unique enough to stand apart.  If you don't have some other game to occupy your time, DS3 is an awesome game. However, don't go in expecting something comparable to DS 1 or 2. Expect another Diablo clone and while it is a pretty good clone, no clone is comparable to the original.","June 28, 2013","true","11.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

But I stuck with it and decided that this was something worth finishing.\n\nThe game is good. The graphics are nice. The story is a real page turner (meaning it grabs you and makes you play on to get to the next chapter). As a Dungeon Siege game, though, there is very little customization that we saw in the first two installments. Having only 1 other ally with you in single player is a bummer, as well. But all-in-all, this was a good time and maybe I'll come back to it to try the story from another character's view once my backlog slims down (yeah, right).","October 19, 2014","true","16.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I saw something called "doom", and a plethora of others when i visitted the first shop..\n\ntheres a half arsed deconstruct system, which seemingly has no use.. Youcan "enchant" items, but its merely a stat boost for one of the stats on the item.. The weapons, and armors sometimes change the appearance of your character, but they all look 100% the same in inventory, and as such, are easily lost in the mix..\n\nIf the combat is the onlyredeeming quality in this game, give it wide birth!","May 3","false","3.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's not a bad game.\n\nDungeon Siege 3 is not like its predecessors. Overburdened with strange, clunky PC controls and a horrible interface, despite its shortcomings, DS3 is a really competent Action RPG that deviates from the mold of its two older siblings and does its own thing to its own fault, since it disappointed a lot of people by not being... well, too much like a Dungeon Siege game.\n\nBut isn't it? I believe it actually is. There's loot drops, there's plenty of places to go (though most of them consist of narrower hallways, something it got from Dungeon Siege 2), and its combat system, while strange and quirky, is fun and cathartic.\n\nNo, you can't customize your character as you could before, but the characters you can choose from are classic archetypes of the characters we used to use in previous games anyway, so I don't know what the issue is. You always just stuck with a single specialization anyway or your character would not have turned out very good...\n\nAnyways, this game suffered a mixed reception because it carried the name Dungeon Siege, and it wasn't the same Dungeon Siege game that people remembered and thought this game would be. Instead, it is a relatively competent action RPG with clunky controls... but still, I think it's worthy of praise for what it has done - not worthy of scorn for what it could have been.","January 15, 2015","true","29.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's not a bad game.\n\nDungeon Siege 3 is not like its predecessors. Overburdened with strange, clunky PC controls and a horrible interface, despite its shortcomings, DS3 is a really competent Action RPG that deviates from the mold of its two older siblings and does its own thing to its own fault, since it disappointed a lot of people by not being... well, too much like a Dungeon Siege game.\n\nBut isn't it? I believe it actually is. There's loot drops, there's plenty of places to go (though most of them consist of narrower hallways, something it got from Dungeon Siege 2), and its combat system, while strange and quirky, is fun and cathartic.\n\nNo, you can't customize your character as you could before, but the characters you can choose from are classic archetypes of the characters we used to use in previous games anyway, so I don't know what the issue is. You always just stuck with a single specialization anyway or your character would not have turned out very good...\n\nAnyways, this game suffered a mixed reception because it carried the name Dungeon Siege, and it wasn't the same Dungeon Siege game that people remembered and thought this game would be. Instead, it is a relatively competent action RPG with clunky controls... but still, I think it's worthy of praise for what it has done - not worthy of scorn for what it could have been.","January 15, 2015","true","29.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Схема, которая позволяет побеждать разные виды и группы противников, вырабатывается сама собой, и довольно быстро. В процессе прохождения некоторой локации, она только оттачивается. С боссами - примерно то же самое.\n- небольшая вариативность прокачки персонажей. Не уверен, насколько это минус. Ведь если вы играете за бойца - вы и качать его будете в бойца, так ведь? Остается лишь вопрос лучшего подбора скиллов.\n- малое разнообразие врагов. То есть, некоторые типы будут преследовать вас всю игру. У некоторых просто поменяются скины. В целом, уникальных противников - разве что автоматоны.\n- малый размер локаций. Тут нечего даже и добавить - так и есть.\n- снаряжение. Огромное количество одинаковых предметов, один из которых дает +1 к оглушению, другой +1 к вампиризму.\n- интеллект напарника. Его нет :)\n\nНо. В наличии и плюсы:\n- разработчик. Я немало удивился, когда узнал, что DS 3 делали Obsidian. Но они сделали все, чего мне хотелось - сюжет, лор, диалоги, побочные квесты, выбор (и местами весьма непростой), который при всем при том влияет на историю.\n- динамика боев. Уж очень мне понравилась сама система. Да, она проста, зато низок порог вхождения. Но она и смотрится неплохо, и играется приятно, особенно на контроллере.\n- режим кооперативного прохождения. Еще не пробовал, но, думается мне, компанией как всегда будет еще веселее.\n- сложность. Даже на среднем уровне сложности, некоторые бои могут заставлять ваши руки до хруста сжимать контроллер.\n- финальный ролик. В котором вам расскажут последствия всех принятых вами решений.\n\nИ вроде бы как минусов набралось больше. Туда ведь можно еще впихнуть слабый дизайн, как большинства локаций, так и персонажей и снаряжения. Графику, которая серединка на половинку. Невнятность большинства образов NPC.\nНо. Dungeon Siege 3 по-прежнему останется игрой, которая глубоко тронула меня. Простая в освоении, она все же не стесняется испытывать игрока. Невзрачная на вид, она несет в себе какую-то простую искренность. Будучи игрой про уничтожение полчищ врагов Легиона, она заставляет принимать решения и их последствия. История, в которую хочется верить. Одна из тех битв, которая оставляет след. Конец, который требует продолжения.\n\nP.S: и вот еще что. Я очень рад, что третья часть не похожа на первые две.","July 15, 2015","true","27.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

Gone are the great party-building mechanics (you can only have 1 follower at a time from a limited choice which only changes depending on which character you choose at the beginning).  Gone are the innovative levelling mechanics (use nothing but bows and arrows and level up in only bows and arrows/use magic and swords and level in both/etc.) to be replaced with a fairly standard "choose your new stats and feats" option when levelling up.\nThe story is a lovely follow on from the events of the previous games and fans of the original will enjoy the nods to past exploits (and occasional easter eggs).\nLooks-wise the game is better than average, with some nice effects.  Music is nice, but nothing special.\nSynergy between party members is more a case of choose what works for you in a given situation (swapping party members can be done any time out of combat so if you reach a certain boss and die, try a different party member).  Each character has the option to use 1 of 2 stances and weapon loadouts at the press of a button to make combat variable depending on your playstyle (eg two-handed sword for swinging at lots of enemies vs sword and shield for singular, tougher opponents.\nAll-in-all I do recommend this game for the casual gamer who wants nothing more than a game they can dip into and out of without feeling like they absolutely MUST complete it now, now, now!  I got mine using raptr points (I know, who uses raptr anymore :D) and it was on sale so I lost nothing by buying it... but what I gained was a look back at a world I once loved playing in and may just go back to again...

If you are someone with ANY cognitive or physical challenges or even frustrated by utter incompetence--do not waste your money on this game.\n\nThe FOV is atrocious. The camera is wonkier than handing a toddler your video cam and asking him to film his birthday party. I found the controller stuttered and skidded, crashing my character into walls, barrels etc. for no apparent reason. The camera won't do anything other than overhead unless the stars are in the right configuration and the moon is full so you can't see a demmed thing that's coming from RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. Hello? If they wanted a Diablo-type top-down the reason that worked was the FOV was a large area. It's like they couldn't make up their minds what they were going for, here.\n\nThe lighting is grim. It's hard to see anything.\n\nThe characters choices are ridiculous. Puleeze, a medieval rogue with GUNS? There's no clear explanations of which spells do what for the mage. It's like someone in the concepts department yelled "Hey! Nobody ever did THIS before!!!" [Well yeah, they did, and they did it much better--I'm looking at YOU, Arcanum]\n\nThe dialogue was mailed in by someone who flunked their first year in college lit and the voice acting caused my dog to chase my eyeballs across the floor when they fell out from rolling so hard. It wasn't even cheesy enough to be amusing. I can get past a few poor NPC performances and some self-deprecating cheese but not just plain bad.\n\nI have no idea what the story is about  because the game is virtually unplayable. The controls are ludicrous, unclear and can't be re-mapped for easier playability or to accomodate physical challenges or disabilities.\n\nIt's been a decade or more since I played the first two so I'm not basing this on my fond memories since senility has set in...although I recall them as entertaining and feeding a donkey some daggers. I'm basing this on the utter crapfest of how this game was put together for playability.\n\nRun for your lives!","June 14, 2015","false","2.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

Yes, exactly, this game has certain traits that make it similar to Blizzard's ancient legacy. I didn't really expect that even modern games will still be influenced by it. Of course, it does not mean that this one has old-fashioned pixelized graphics or something - no, the visual part of it is nice. I speak of the general idea that stands behind it, and the gameplay peculiarities.\nIt's rather good, though. I'm a bit tired of open-world RPGs by now, and I was seeking for something with a fine, lengthy, and entertaining main quest. I can say, that's something I found. 18 hours of gameplay is a decent result for a contemporary product, and I still have 3 more characters to study and experience.\nWhat I disliked was the camera management. It offers 3rd person view only; it's suitable when you are surrounded by enemies, but generally I hate looking into the ground instead of seeing what is in front of my character. That's especially tiresome in narrow tunnels or passages, when the camera constantly jumps - now it's close, and now it's far, and now it's close again.\nIt's not astonishing, but neither is it terribly bad. A solid action RPG that will let you spend some days of your life with fun.","June 17, 2013","true","24.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The biggest issue is that it's sometimes prone to targeting the wrong enemy. And I could have done with less cheesecake in the character designs. Finally, if you're a die hard action-rpger, you'll probably find it too short and the character abilities not diverse enough.\n\nThat said, I liked it.  It's certainly my favorite of the Dungeon Siege games, overall: the combat was more diverse and interesting than in 1 or 2 (though 2 had better boss fights), and the characters were given more depth.  Though certainly not the deepest tale, the story was also stronger than in the other games.  Most importantly, DS3 has a satisfying ending, with plenty of 'what happened to ...' information about the post-game world.  I leave the game feeling pretty happy about the experience, unlike DS2 and the terrible non-ending it offered up.","January 31, 2014","true","15.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Only play this game if you want to play single player.\n\nMultiplayer review\nIn short, If you want a co-op rpg DONT PLAY THIS GAME. It has one of the worst versions of multiplayer i have ever seen in a game. The game forces both players into the same screen (which for pc is a slap in the face), only the host of the game gets to progress any character, money spend is the hosts money, any items obtained are only obtained for teh host, If you have a mic plugged in its always on (no toggle to talk) and etc. Overall its pretty much pointless to play multiplayer unless you own it on console and only play with a friend at your house.\n\nSingle Player review\nIf you are reading this you most likely dont care about multiplayer or realize that the game has been out for so long that the multiplayer base (what little there was) is now dead. Honestly i have to say that the single player aspects in this game are fantastic. While in single player you are limited to only 1 additional teammate. Depending on play style will depend on who you like to partner with the most. The story line is the thing that suprised me the most. Unlike mass effect your decisions often effect you long term. For example early in the game you get the choice of killing an archon, putting her in jail, or letting her go free. While the first choice will give you an extremely powerfull staff for that level, it will in turn make all future instances with archons hate you forever.\n\nCombat\nThe combat is what i really enjoy most about this game. Each character you have has 3 abilities and 2 stances that they can switch between totaling 6 abilities overall. Each stance is either single target is aoe focused. Each stance though often has buffs or pets you can summon that remain active even if you switch. So reguardless of the situation i often found myself switching between them fairly often just to get the extra buff out even if that stance wasn't optimal. Using its combat system took a little to get use to. It's a small delay but deals quite a bit of dmg if you are able to get combo hits off or finish a long casting spell.","March 30, 2015","true","55.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This Is a very good game, but with it's own flaws. Much like any other game, those flaws will be present and overrated by people who only spend their time looking for those flaws. The game is set much like Diablo but without the randomly generated maps. Instead, you have a well made out landscape(although somewhat obscured by a lack of camera pitch) that is very detailed and well thought out. The environment is nicely detailed and the seamless transition between inside and outside is a very nice detraction from the constant loading screens that haunt most games. The story is somewhat linear, but the side quests and DLC can keep you entertained for hours on end. My first playthrough of the game as Lucas is completed as of this post (I still have yet to complete the game with the other characters) and have roughly amassed 40+ hours. Reading all of the lore inscribed really immerses you into the world even though it's not necessary in a hack & slash rpg. The dialogue was well spoken and richly entertaining especially once you reach Stonebridge and listen to the automotons. The characters respond rather well to your hero, although the AI leaves somewhat of a burden when playing solo as I do. All in all, I still recommend this game.","April 25, 2014","true","65.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The bad mainly because it's not like the other Dungeon Siege games, etc. As I am new to the series and I briefly played this game with a friend on her Xbox 360 I decided to but it for myself.\n\nLet me tell, this game was so much fun to play! I usually tend to get some form of lag while playing system games on my laptop, but I got none what-so-ever with this game. It was both a refreshing and fun game to play. The level system is simple and easy to use. It was nice just to choose what abilities I wanted to buy or upgrade instead of using a point system to upgrade attack, defense, health points, etc. Your weapons, armor, and accessories decide to what kind of stat points you get.\n\nI highly recommend you get a Xbox 360 PC gaming controller from Microsoft (check amazon.com, that where I got mine for like $23) to play this game with. Before I got the controller I spent an hour just trying to map the game commands to the keyboard to my liking but it just didn't work for me. Playing on the keyboard was just too clumsily and ackward.\n\nYou get to choose from 4 characters to play as. A sword user (male), a gun user (female), staff/spear user (female), and a magic user (male). I choose the gun character and as my supporting party member in battle was usually either the sword user or magic user.\n\nI am nearly done with the game. I just need to fight the final boss and then my first play through of the game is done. I think this game has a high replayability.\n\nI am not disappointed with this game and I will continue to sing its praises. The only thing I am sad about is that I am almost down the my first playthrough of the game and that I will have to start anew with a new character once this storyline is done.\n\nOut of a scale of 10, I give this game a 9.","May 16, 2014","true","39.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took away the freedom to play your character as you like and to see him evolve and develop to a Character you can say to have forged untill he was a Master of his Art.\nBut it still added something to the Universe of DS. You were able to have a plot which may not be the most diversed but stil enjoyable and even twisted from time to time. You have enjoyable and less enjoyable Characters and therefore you bind yourself more to certain characters and you see yourself drifting away from others.\n\nThe Controls feel definitally better if you use any kind of Controller(I used a XBox 360 Controller and it felt quite well)\n\nThe Graphics fit the all in all atmosphere of the game and has a unique style to it (At least i see it that way)\n\nSo all in all I have to say its two-sided. It may not be as deep and impressive for its age than DS and DSII were for theirs but its still an easygoing, from time to time very enjoyable and playable game.\nI recommend it for Fantasy/RPG first timers and people who didnt play DS/DS2 or to those who want a relaxed game with challenge peaking up from time to time.","May 18, 2014","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With a balanced ablility tree with defensive offensive and passive powers there is no battle you cannot win.  The Armor system alone in this game is unique as you have to really think about how to balance your gear for maximum effect.  Agility is crucial for critical hits which matters when you come up against higher level opponents so brute force isn't the only answer in all enagements.

It's possible to build a character that can't progress beyond a boss and becomes stuck.  There are plenty of save points; make a lot of new saves.\nReading texts in game is terribly executed.  I keep telling myself I'll read them later in the Lore menu.\nThe visuals are pretty but the settings are finicky.  Adequately controlling the camera requires a thumbstick.  Fighting and moving the camera together can easily require 5 simultaneous keystrokes.\nI mute the music and listen to a playlist of my favorite bands.\nI really enjoyed DS1 and DS2 with all their expansions and Broken Sword.\nThis game made me yell a few times.\nAfter slapping it around a few times with the G13 I feel that tender Dungeon Siege attraction.","May 2, 2012","true","46.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That\'s because this isn\'t a bad game in and of itself- I actually liked it more than I expected- but it breaks the mold of the original games in an unimpressive way.  If you played the original Baldur\'s Gate games and then played Baldur\'s Gate: Dark Alliance, you know exactly what\'s happened here.\nSo if you want a controller-friendly hack and slasher with good visuals, good audio, pretty good gameplay, and a \"meh\" story, look no further.  You\'ll get a pretty good, cost-effective time here.\nIf you want Dungeon Siege 3, find something else.","May 31","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
