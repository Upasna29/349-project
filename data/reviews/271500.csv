That there are no adjustable sights, all firearms seem to be sighted in for 50m, and you generally won't be going much farther than that (Which is pitiful in a Sniper game because I can hit a man-sized target with a PISTOL at that range). Speaking of which, the silenced Luger P08 that you start out with isn't capable of being aimed with iron sights, only hip fired. You also can't use the iron sights of your sniper rifle, only the scope. Also, there's wind effects on the go in this game. Apparently in WWII, wind could go in pretty much any direction at any time, strong enough to potentially sway a 150-200gr rifle round going 2500-2850 ft/s off the point of aim within the mere distance of 50m. If you're on a budget, love sniping games, and this is the ONLY one you can afford, then I suppose you could get it, however I doubt you'll find much enjoyment. You'd be far better off getting a game such as Red Orchestra II.\n\nAdjustable sights, bullet drop at a distance, ability to use either scope or iron sights with the push of a button in case you get caught in close range, pistols actually have useable iron sights, and even if a player survives a rifle round, they might still bleed out in short time. Then there's the ability to rest your firearm against a window sill/door frame/rock/almost anything to make your aiming almost perfectly steady, even if you're a bit out of breath. There's a plethora of other realistic qualities in RO2 if that's what you're after. If you want an easier game of lesser quality and lower price, look no further. This one might keep you busy while you're on a tight budget.\n\nPerhaps this game was made around 2004 or something and I expect too much of it, feels like something that'd be on the PS2. At least the sights on the scope are realistic for the time, unlike that damn Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie game that came out a while back. There is so much wrong with that game's ballistics... don't get me started.","January 31, 2014","false","0.2"," 535 of 613 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","535","613","4","25"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroUltimate/recommended/271500/","PyroUltimate","--","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroUltimate/","550 products in account","I got this game for free when I bought one of the Sniper Ghost Warrior part. And well it is an old City Interactiv game which should say everything about the quality of the game but I still made the mistake and played it.\n\n\nNegative Points\nAI\n- The AI is horrible. They will detect you from 20 kilometers away, they can see you through all kind of buildings and vegetation, if you hit them they immediately find you, often they dont react if you just killed one of their group etc.\n\nHit Detection / Hitboxes\n- Also pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Sometimes you just dont hit the enemy even if you perfectly aim at him. Also the enemies can take a lot of bullets if you dont hit their heads (which is a problem due the low ammo you have and the problem that the game dont recognize that you clearly aim at them).\n\nOptions and controls\n- Only 2 different resolutions available, no real sound option\n- The controls are buggy, you slide around pretty often\n\nSavepoints\n- Just ridiculous. Sometimes the game autosaves the game just a few seconds before you get killed. And if you load that savegame you get instantly killed again so the savegame is brocken.\n- Sometimes I tried to save the game via Quicksave, the game said "Saved", I died and the game started from a totally differnt spot (what means IT DID NOT SAVE THE GAME). Good work!\n\nGraphics\n- Very bad for today standards. I am not sure when this game was released (the most sources name a release date between 2007 - 2008). This would mean that the graphics of this game was still below the average when it was released.\n\nStory\n- Completly rubbish. The story makes no sence, the missions are boring and you have to do always the same. The monologues/dialogues are so freaking bad, the voice acting (german version) is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... it is just a pain at all.\n- Story is short (around 2 hours) which normaly is a negative point but for this game I was really happy that I had not to suffer longer.\n\nCut\n- German version of the game is cut (Nazi symbols AND gore effects) which means no swastikas, no blood, no ragdolls after death.\n\nAtmosphere\n- Nonexistent. You just dont feel like a sniper in WW2, the bad level design, the bad model design and the bad sound doing the rest.\n\nBugs\n- This game is full of bugs. You get stucked so many times, the AI (especally with their trucks and tanks) are completly bugged, animation bugs, mission target bugs, problems with picking up a weapon etc.\n- Cutscenes are also buggy\n- Ladders are very deadly. Sometimes if you try to interact with a ladder you get killed. Going down the ladder is even more dangerous so I often just slided down the walls of the building..\n- Mission 5 is so buggy that my game crash many times\n\nOther things\n- You can not zoom while you lean\n- Horrible placement of most ladders (you just fell from the roof when you go up a ladder because the end of the ladder is so badly placed)\n- Your team mates kill you if you ran into their fireline (but you cant kill them)\n- Only 2 sniper rifels avalible (also there are only 1 mp, 1 pistol and 1 knife/melee weapon)\n- There is a button for throwing grandes but I never had granades and I never found pickable granades. Maybe you just throw the granades back if an enemy use it but this would be non sense because they explode pretty fast so you would die in 99% of all trys)\n- Devs say that the game has a "complex ballistic system" - it is a lie.\n\n\n\nNeutral Points\nNo Multiplayer\n- Game have no multiplayer. Not that bad because I am pretty sure that it wouldnt work and no one would play it anymore.\n\n\n\nPositive Points\nNone\n\n\n\nConclusionDo not buy it. I know it only costs around 3€ but this is way too much for this game. The game is bad, dont work properly and it is just a huge waste of time. Only russians defends this game because you are a "russian snajper hero" so do you a favor and dont buy/play it.","September 27, 2015","false","2.5"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","39","47","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skops/recommended/271500/","Skops","Skops","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skops/","405 products in account","Sniper: Art of Victory is an FPS game that is basically a discount Sniper Elite. If you know what the Sniper Elite franchise does, you'll find just about everything here mimic'd but done in lesser polish. If there was ever a phrase to describe this game, "you get what you pay for" fits this one perfectly.\n\nGRAPHICS:Art of Victory's presentation is painfully average. While there is nothing wrong with the models and terrain shape, the textures are sorely lacking. Everything is heavily washed out and nothing really has any detail, if you take a close look at anything; its just a blur. Animations are extremely stiff, the Germans will be in a walk cycle only to stop, look like they're about to attack, spin around, and continue walking.. it looks really goofy. Death animations also are stiff. When you shoot a soldier, they stiffen out and twitch about like their having a seizure. Just not good stuff here, I could go on, but there's other stuff to talk about. It should also be noted that this game does not support widescreen.\n\nGAMEPLAY:This is where the game falls apart; both creatively, and functionally. I say creatively because all of the shooting mechanics are completely and shamelessly ripped straight from the Sniper Elite series. When you aim down sight, you must hold your breath (which slows down time), control your heart beat, and adjust for bullet drop/wind. Then pull the trigger. You might also be greeted with a cinematic animation showing your bullets journey right into a soldiers face... Sound familiar? It should. Sniper Elite does all of that, but far better than whats displayed here.\nThat is what you'll be doing for 90% of the game. You'll also be equipt with a silenced pistol and knife, but both of those will be utterly useless as you'll almost never get close to the enemy to use them. Even when you have an oppertunity, the pistol is so unbelievably inaccurate you'll miss 6/8 shots you take from 6ft away..\nThis brings me to where Sniper: Art of Victory is just mechanically broken. There are times where you can aim dead center in someones chest, pull the trigger, and nothing happens. The hit regestration is peticularly fickle in missions 5 & 6 for seemingly unknown reasons. Not only that, but you will frequently be ensnared by the worlds geometry and may sometimes be forced to restart at a previous checkpoint.\n\nSOUND:The soundtrack to the game is all stereotypical war trumpets and orchestral tunes. Not bad, but nothing memorable. The sniper rifles have a good crack to them, at the very least, I would say it sounds like a rifle. The voice acting is unreal. I swear they just put words into a program and recorded the playback its that robotic.\n\nSTORY:I honestly don't think there is a story here. You play as a sniper in the Russian Red Army and you run through eight seemingly unconnected missions to the campaigns completion. I didn't even know the protagonist was Russian until mission three's briefing file specifically saying "glorious Red Army". None of the missions are peticularly hard, one comes dangerously close to ripping off a famous scene from Enemy At The Gates. The game shouldn't take anyone more than 2 hours to get through.\n\nOVERALL:I'm a little devided on how I should view this game. It's creatively bankrupt; it doesn't try to do anything new with the genre, and even what it does, it's kind of broken while doing it. However, at its full price point of just $2.99 CDN (I bought it for $1.24), what can I really expect?\n\nI didn't hate this game, but I can't recommend it either. Put your $2.99 towards something else.","January 10, 2015","false","6.8"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","25","33","2","0"

Hitboxes are somewhat majorly broken, enemys will sometime duck exactly at the same time you shoot. AI is miserable, as even your allies will kill you because they are only programmed to keep shooting in the same area where you are supposed to go. Enemies have superhuman hearing. The only reasonable explaination why you will not be able to sneak up on them, and why they can so accuratly triagnulate your position (if you miss a shot). There are only 4 different guns to choose from, the Luger and the MP40 hardly hits anything (even at close range). So make that only 2 guns that are usefull. Both of which are just different sniper rifles. You can't loot ammo from bodies, only swap out guns. Your choice; MP40 with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of ammo? OR an MP40 with an even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of ammo? There are 'guns' you an get through cheats (AK47, M60). However, there are absolutly no models for these, and they all take up the same inventory slot. Cheat Shotguns aside, the long list of cheat weapons became moot since most of them where 'Gun that shoots fast'.\n\nTL;DR: NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY","February 1, 2014","false","4.4"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","19","24","2","0"

It's not a good game and calling it a bad game is being generous, but that doesn't mean you can't have fun with it. Parts of this game are so broken that it can be amusing; like sprinting up behind an enemy, slashing with a knife from several feet away, which will kill that enemy somehow. You can fire your weapons from incredibly closeby and enemies won't respond unless they feel like it. The list of funny bad things goes on...\n\nAnyways, I recommend this game to people who enjoy bad games. It's a fun kind of bad where it's playable and even enjoyable for all the wrong reasons. This is an obvious budget title that you could expect to see in an OfficeMax "games" aisle, so keep that in mind. If you prefer to play good games that have an actual development budget, come from veteran dev teams, and have undergone extensive QA testing, then stay the hell away from this game.

I didn't play more than 40 minutes of this because:\n- Enemies are unforgivingly broken (shot at me through a wall across the map).\n- Controls are extremely slow and sticky (don't go prone near objects, you'll most likely get stuck and have to do an extremely slow reversing maneuvre).\n- The maps were lush and very good-looking, but didn't conceal THE BARBED WIRE PRISON FENCE keeping you inside the play areas. Nice level of detail and modelling, but quickly-seen-through player restriction in level design.\n- Story is paperthin and easily trashed by player interaction (first map objective is getting on an enemy truck - to get inside the camp with the truck, you have to kill everyone present (because they can see you through the walls), which would probably include any would-be driver).\n- Secondary weapons are useless because you will get killed by a spray of bullets as you round the corner (because they see you through the walls). Sniper rifle is useless when there are more than two enemies that need to be killed within a small timeframe.\n\nYou'd be better off buying the later installments - Sniper: Ghost Warrior 1+2.

If you stay at least 15 feet away from the enemy they're very unlikely to hit you since the AI stands in place and fires blindly for the most part.\n\nThe story is generic and uninteresting and the voice acting is horrendous. The main character sounds like he's trying too hard and the NPCs sound like they stopped trying years ago. The rest of the audio design is not bad actually, the guns and explosions are alright, and the music is actually very good at times. But since the rest of the game is bad it just results in it being comedic.\n\nUltimately, if you're looking for any kind of good game, you should know this isn't one based on the reviews :P But if you're a fan of bad games or are just desprate to play something old that's cheap, give this a whirl! It's definitely worth the $3.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, I stopped a while in when I discovered that there were copious amounts of holes in the level that I could get trapped in invisible walls and forced me to restart levels over and over again.","February 5, 2014","true","1.5"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","9","17","2","0"

It should be dismissed as a technological error, and the developers should be given a second chance because there is no way anyone should have this disaster on their papers.\n\nDid I say that today it would be dismissed? Oh, yes. This game is from 2008. And doesn't support a resolution higher than 1280x720. It looks worse than a Playstation 2 game, and the mechanics aren't even befitting of the praise to be on a console such as that.\n\nIt may not have been the developers fault, as I hear the sequel is better, but Art of Victory?

Also you can't sneak up on these enemies for a game that relies on stealth killings it's terribly executed you got a knife but can't use it properly as enemy has eyes in back of their heads it seems all this hassle even on easy difficulty also 3 bullets kill you dead I don't mind that SGW wasn't much diffrent but atleast in that game sneak kills wasn't pointless and was done with ease long as you take your time and not rush, but here don't matter if you play like a turtle or not don't waste $3 don't waste a single dime on this crapper go get sniper ghost warrior 1 i just got 2 bout give it a try i hear best from the 3 i liked SGW  to be honest even though it had negative feed back but I enjoyed it with no issues so try sgw & sgw2 and skip this junk if they was to remaster this game with sgw1/2 developments it might actually be playable.

I could not with this game. Not even halfway through the 3rd mission, I actually stopped the game and deleted the local content. It really is that bad.\n\nFirst off, the graphics for the time it was made is sub standard. But I suppose for $4 for the game, what can you expect. Oh wait. I have paid $4 for better games with better graphics. But I could deal with the graphics for what it was. On the first mission, the game seemed ok, like let's just get through this game and dump it at the end.\n\nStealth is well you can shoot enemies and it can take a few bullets. But if you miss, no matter where you go, it's like the AI has TOTAL auto aim and auto fire on. And this is on the easy difficulty.\n\nThis is proabaly a perfect game for kid who wants to learn some basics, but even then, there are much better games. I found myself becoming bored and disinterested really fast with this game as well. It is unfortuante because it looks like it has potential to be a great game, but I have yet to try the next one, and I hope it's not a waste of money and time like this one here.\n\nDo youself a favour. If you are going to spend 3 bucks on a sniper game I would HIGHLY suggest Sniper Elite 1.

First, there is a left-to-right sway that constantly throws your aim off.  Maybe the game designers were thinking they were being clever by adding in one other element to challenge the player that was unlike other games, but it's simply not fun at all and often it seems quite random whether you actually hit your target or not.  Second, ammo starvation to the max.  I don't even think you can get more than 30 bullets max per weapons, and with enemies always getting an instant kill on you, it's not like you're going to find more ammo easily.  Third, everything else: knifing people doesn't work, so it's not a stealth game, some missions are made impossible at a certain savepoint if you lack ammo, the pistol and submachine guns are horribly inaccurate, etc., etc., etc..  I wanted something like Hitman with a focus on the sniping part, but all I got was this really overthought, overchallenging, and unpleasant game.","August 28, 2014","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought the three pack for this game, so I decided to start with the first game of the series. Well, it isn't too impressive. The AI can seemingly sense you from behind a corner and be ready for you when you come around it, and yet, if someone falls dead in front of them they couldn't seem to care less. The hit-boxes are terrible, and it can be hard to line up headshots (I'm not even sure where on the crosshair the bullet's supposed to land: sometimes it hits at the top of the arrow, sometimes is lands just below it, idk). If you don't score headshots, it takes at least 2-3 rounds to the chest to kill someone, and you only get about 20 bullets for the sniper-rifle per level. The levels are pretty short, mainly comprised of a "get to this area" or "kill this guy". There's no zoom on the rifle, which can be a pain, especially when you need to zoom in for any amount of accuracy (I'm looking at you, level where you need to shoot the explosives from across the map). Wind sway is a pretty cool mechanic, but again, they literally missed the mark. It's fairly high up on the screen so it can be kind of hard to keep track of, and it doesn't seem to have any kind of pattern to it, sometimes it'll be to the left a few notches, then it'll switch to the right, then it'll just be flat- the levels appear to be taking place in the middle of a tornado. All in all, I'd have to recommend skipping this one and at least going for one of the later games in the series (although I don't know how good they are yet, haven't played past this one.) At the very least, there are some better sniper games out there (sniper elite) for anyone who wants some precision action.","January 9","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's if your bullets can avoid some invisible walls.\nPointless secondary weapon - a silenced pistol that you can't aim down sights, and has an enormous hip-fire aim spread.\nUnskipable cutscenes.\nAtrocious voice acting - your soviet soldier speaks with an emotionless american accent, and they actors routinely mess up the dialogue.  It's like they just did the whole script in one take and went with it.  At one point, the dialogue is meant to be "target eliminated" and the VA says "target elimited".  Nobody in QA noticed.
