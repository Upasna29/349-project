The ships  look good,but controlling them is not as easy as in Shogun2 Fall of the Samurai however  there are many options of things to make and courses of action  to follow.In the very short time I have played there have been no bugs or glitches.So if you like the period I think this maybe a useful addition to combined ops in the US civil war.Give it a try....","November 6, 2015","true","2.0"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

The rise of ironclads is a turning point of naval history and a great background for a naval simulation. And every new naval sim is a good thing. Frankly I'm surprised that the game did not notice the portals and blogs as Wargamer or SimHQ. I found this game by accident. I bought a tablet PC and began looking for games suitable for the technical requirements, and my interests.\n\nIn turned-based mode this game is a great introduction to deep strategy games, with a lot of the under-the-hood stuff being cut out to focus on movements and battles. Not very easy to master, but much more detailed than it looks like and, most of all, pretty accurate from historical point of view. The AI will beat you down and exploit every error in your strategy and must have been inspired by an advanced chess program, and if you dont pay close attention when playing youll have your head handed to you in short order. This is the part where the games AI really shines: tactical withdrawals, smart counterattacks, always looking for the gap that can be used to destroy your forces. This part of the game is absolute self-sufficient and I would not be surprised if some people will play the game and do not use manual battles. Even if you're not a fan of naval battles, this game mode will entice you.\n\nThe graphical interface of the game is generally clean and simple, well adapted to the skirmish scale of naval battles. I specially appreciate the use of simplified navigating instruments to change the direction or the speed of the boat. Graphically, the game looks pretty good, is functional, and adds to the game. Warships and other units are very detailed, well rendered and look very good.\n\nBut for such a game, which appeals to a specific group of fans, I hoped for some more features in real time battle mode. Crew management and such... ships should be allowed to designate how much crew are to work on repairs, put firesout etc. not just random.\n\nIn my view, its a little lacks depth in real time mode to be a really great game, but I would recommend it for wargame and naval enthusiasts! Basically if you have any interest what so ever in Civil War naval combat this is the choice of game to place, I highly recommend it!","December 14, 2015","true","11.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Clear rules and only a few minutes to understand the game mechanism. But I recommend reading the manual before starting the game. The mechanics well suit the style of naval weapons employed during the American Civil War. Good game with a combination of cat and mouse blockade simulation.","November 6, 2015","true","25.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/osiris_dev/recommended/414260/","osiris_dev","Asur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/osiris_dev/","131 products in account","What can I say about the game. From first look not easy to understand what to do. You don't have any instructions about what ship or infantry to buy, or do you need this structure now or later and other similar things. You don't even have much of interface on strategic map, as on a tactical map too, actually. So what can you do?\n\nFirst you get the idea that the game looks like tabletop game and you need to interact with units on map like with figures on the tabletop. All statistics you get from dialogs of ships, soldiers, slots and structures. Only two actions you use in game - point and click, for build or move units. So maybe game is too simple?\n\nI don't say so. Second and main thing in game is the strategy. No one tells you what to do and when, you just get the idea from start dialog and manual, that you need to capture all harbors of opponent. How? It is a way of mistakes and learning. You can try to rush and destroy emeny's fleet in harbor but costal batteries can destroy all your fleet. You can wait for ironclads but raiders can destroy all your trade. You can capture harbor now, but can you defend it from counter attack?\n\nI don't know, don't win yet ... but I have some ideas. Computer opponent making a good play by the way, little place for mistake. Game is challenging but interesting.","November 7, 2015","true","14.1"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

There is lots of depth to be found under the initial apparent simplicity of this game - don't run off because some have spent little time on it, then trashed it. Buy it!\n\nIronclads 2 is very easily moddable. All files are in plain text .xml. I've done a lot of game modding and 3rd party software for games over the years. This one is built on the same chassis as Pacific Storm + Pacific Storm Allies. You can change ANYTHING, including the game interface.\n\nI've already modded and upgraded the camera angles, font colors to make them more readable to my old eyes, fixed the issue with the non-working ESC (escape) key. I'm playing with the battle map interface right now. Much more can be done.\n\nVictorian Admirals, also by Totem Games (though a simple battle interface) and the other naval games in the developers kit bag are built on the same chassis too, and highly moddable. I picked up Victorian Admirals for the cheap, cheap price of $2.99 yesterday.\n\nThanks for opening up this game.\n\n-timetraveller\n\nSoftware modded and developed for:\n\nSilent Hunter 3 + file tweakers\nSilent Hunter 4 + file tweakers\nEnigma Rising Tide + Mission Editor\nBattle Stations Midway/ Pacific + Mission Editor\nPacific Storm/ Pacific Storm Allies + Mission Editor\nShip Simulator\nRail Simulator\nPanzers","May 8","true","3.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I wanted and didn't buy. I read in reviews that the strategic part in game turned out very successful. I also read that guys from Totem team seriously improved this part of game later. But I didn't buy again. I was guarded by comments on another part of game, more important for me. I mean battles of the warships in real time. What I read also what I saw on screenshots was too simple and boring. And then there was a new updating in which promised new battle system. I bought game and I don't regret for it at all. In game everything is made not as I imagined, but feelings from game just excellent. I am constantly busy, I choose maneuvers, I repair the ships, I with own hand shoot each shell and I see his flight! It is a best game for the fanatic of naval sims!","May 4","true","11.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game has a simple graphics and single click controlling without any additional menu or tune. However, it can not guaranty an easy winning. Because the computer opponent don't let you make a mistake twice. It seems like an old school game and I like it. The modern approach when you sure the AI just trying to lose not so clear is useless. Only understanding a blockade mechanism give you ending of wartime with a nice rate. Read the manual first. Fortunately, the game have saved all your turns to get back in time to do something right. And don't forget about manual battle. Some times David can bit Goliath, you know. I didn't get 100% rate or less a bit, but I know it's possible and I have wish to do it.","November 16, 2015","true","12.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"
