Well the reason is simple: Relic has turned this game into a giantic ♥♥♥♥ing cashgrab with pay2win commanders, an overpriced in game store with microtransactions and a slow transition into a free2play game. This could be related to the 2013 takeover by SEGA and an imposed microtransactions model. I would'nt have granted them a single cent if I knew what they would end up trying to do. Free2play is coming soon. Every update is clear step in the free2play direction. In a final assault they want to get everyone to buy the game before they actually make it f2p. Like with almost every game, free2play will demolish of what is left of a once great game. If you really want to play, just wait for the free2play.\n\nNo, its really that ♥♥♥♥ing bad. During the 2015 christmas sale, certain items were 75% off. Great!, is what you might think. However these ♥♥♥♥ers are so ♥♥♥♥ING greedy that they actually raised the price of certain commanders to 9 euro,s (instead of the normal 2-3) so that they could pretend giving a -75% discount, while selling it for the orginal price :^).\n\nAnother example: The British expansion costs originally 13 euro’s. It has day0DLC commanders that cost 12 euro’s total. So you’ve just bought an expansion and then you already have to pay again? Didn’t I just purchase the expansion to the game…?\n\nMeanwhile I spend about 100 euro's on this game and I always did so gladly. Even with day0 DLC, "no we wont add pay2win commanders, but we actually are adding pay2win commanders", a 40 euro single player campain that didn't add any MP-content and wasn't even worth half of the orginial price, a weird random drop system that they just used to justify their pay2win model, "because now you can get it by drop so it doesnt matter were asking outrages prices for content in our store". (The chance that something drops you actually need or want is nihil and the only thing that really drops are crappy bulletins).\n\nYet, I have always defended this game because it was enjoyable and it was a good RTS. In the end the game is still fine, but the way Relic and Sega want to make money of its player base is not. They have crossed the line.  In recent patches they have made it clear that they only see's players as a cow to be milked before they send you off to the slaughter in the free2play ♥♥♥♥fest they are planning, comrad!.\n\nBe smart and invest in a company that actaully gives a ♥♥♥♥ about their player base. If you don't own this game yet, wait for free2play. If you really want to play it... well the only thing I can say is: get it on sale. It would be worth the money, but be aware of what your getting yourself into and the direction that Relic and Sega are taking this game.\n\nAs a historian I'm offended that they could abuse one of the most significant events in human history like this. They have chosen to use the traditional American centric Hollywood perspective on the war.  Some might like that perspective, but I think those with deeper historical knowledge and understanding will find it unsatisfying and childish. The campaign of COH2 was thus not compelling and (imo) did not paint a complete and historical accurate picture of the Eastern front.","December 31, 2015","false","266.3"," 1,154 of 1,362 people (85%) found this review helpful 71 people found this review funny","85","154","1","71","76"

I like Company of Heroes 2 and I like playing it just as I like the Total War series but I do not like the precedent that is being set through DLC and need to make others aware of it.\n\nI am reviewing this game on the basis that it is full price and all the DLC is full price, which no sane person would pay!  Please, please wait until the game and all its content are on sale to buy it else you feel like you've had a raw deal.  I bought this game for £10 from a supermarket when it was on special offer and the deals Steam puts on can undercut that.  I felt I had got a good deal but if I had paid £29.99 I certainly would have felt cheated.\n\nI'm from a generation of gamers who used to play on 4 colour 8-bit computers where you had to wait for games to load via a tape player that you bought from Tandy.  I've seen the development of PC games from Doom to the present day and it was a sad fact that the internet was double edged.  We had good things like forums, multiplayer servers, modders and the publisher could release updates for the game.  Then the bad like publishers releasing buggy, unfinished games which would then be patched later.  Now we can add to that the insidious practice of DLC (down loadable content) that we must pay for to use.  Now I'm a realist, some DLC such as extra levels or new units may be worth paying for where it adds to the game and its here to stay.  SEGA aren't the only distributors to sell DLC but in the case of Company of Heroes 2 they do let you know what you haven't got!\n\nLet me explain.  So you've just paid £29.99 for this and checked out the DLC from the store page and see that there's some Theatres of War and an add on for Ardennes Assault (this is really a separate game and I won't cover that in detail here but it is a very good campaign).  So what do you get for £29.99?  You get a base Soviet campaign, one theatre of war and some commanders, skins and intel bulletins for skirmish/multiplayer (more on that later).  So you have a relativity engaging single player campaign but for multiplayer you quickly realise you've just been sold a 'starter pack' if you will and you're lacking a hell of a lot.  That doesn't mean it isn't there, it just you can't use it!\n\nOn the main menu screen you are hit with adverts for DLC - Theatres of War, Ardennes Assault and Fox company rangers to try and get you to purchase them.  It seems the game delights in showing you what you don't have.\n\nSo you click on the store page and you are taken to options you cannot see through Steam, you have to see them through the game, those are: Commanders, Skins and Faceplates, all with associated costs.  Then you thin, what have I actually paid for other than the short campaign?  A good Question and the answer raises more questions!\n\nThe theatres of war are like mini campaigns which take place on the maps from multiplayer and some are very challenging but they aren’t worth the full price of the game.  You look at the cost for all the Theatres of War DLC (Southern Fronts £2.99, Stalingrad £6.99 & Case Blue £6.99), total of £16.97.\n\nNow comes the gut wrenching part, the cost for all those bits of DLC for multiplayer.  For those who aren’t familiar with the Company of Heroes games one of their traits is it allows you to select a commander  who has specific abilities that you can use to gain a tactical advantage during the game.  This can be the ability to call in airstrikes, off map artillery, special units or uniquely powerful armoured units such as Tiger tanks.  In the original game there were three commanders (Infantry, Airborne and Armoured).  In this game there are lots, I don’t know how many but there’s a forum about it somewhere.  Initially when you buy the game you get a basic number of commanders for the Soviets and the Werhmacht.  (I got a message that as a legacy player I’d unlocked some so I have a number that weren’t ‘unlocked’ with the base game).  These are critical for your experience on multiplayer and skirmish as the computer can use commanders you don’t have access to and it will.  Likewise, online players may have access to that German commander who can call in a Tiger Ace (a Tiger tank with full veterancy level) and you don’t have a commander who can call in an equally powerful unit.  This makes the game unbalanced.\n\nOK, so I talked about ‘unlocking’ commanders and earlier on I mentioned intel bulletins.  Intelligence Bulletins change the mechanics of the game and you can select three from a vast number of options.  Some are subtle such as giving machine guns a 2% faster rate of fire and some have a greater impact such as giving tanks 20% greater accuracy.  You can’t buy these through DLC (that’s no loss as there’s already plenty of that) you have to ‘unlock’ them.  You unlock more commanders, intel bulletins, vehicle skins and other goodies via the war spoils system.  This essentially involves grinding away for hours on skirmish matches to ‘win’ random war spoils.  There’s no logic or pattern to what you get, when you get it or how many get.  For instance after one 20 minute game I won two war spoils and after one 1 hour game I got none.  Plus you can get repeats like trading cards except you can’t trade them with anyone.  So intel bulletins and commanders are classified as common, scarce and rare.  The rare types being the more useful and more powerful.\n\n‘Rubbish’ you cry, I want the special commanders, can’t I download them?  Yes you can, at a price through that store page accessed via the game.  Now I’m not saying that anyone would buy all the commanders, or that you would even need to, especially as many just have different combinations of the same abilities.  But just say you’re a completest, well there are: 1 x starter bundle of four commanders at £6.49, 8 commanders at £2.79/each, 8 commanders at £2.99/each and 10 commanders at £1.99/each.  Total cost = £72.63.\n\nI’m not finished with the DLC here though, no, you can also alter the cosmetic appearance of the game with vehicle skins (different camouflage paint jobs) and for a full set you need three (one for light vehicles, one for medium and one for heavy).  Now I’m not big on paying for cosmetic changes but just say you wanted to as they were there and you wanted them all.  There are two starter packs (one Soviet and one German) at £4.79/each.  There are then a whopping 40 extra skins at £1.59/each.  Total cost = £73.18\n\nYou can also change the control bar face plate if you so desired and there are four options at £1.59/each.  Total cost = £6.36\n\nThen there are the Western armies (USA and OKW) at £14.99 that you will want for multiplayer.\n\nTotal cost of DLC = £184.13, yes £184.13!!!\n\nBut you say, surely you wouldn’t download all the cosmetic stuff, just what you want.  This is true, but it’s not the point.  You have paid £29.99 for a game that is missing fundamental aspects to make it playable in multiplayer and the only way to get it is to pay more, a lot more.  I would never part with my hard earned cash to buy commanders which should be in the game I’ve bought.  In fact they are in the game, I just can’t use them.  Fix the war spoils system, reward players who are very good and very skilful with the better commanders, don’t fleece us!\n\nThat’s why I can’t recommend this game, stuff the gameplay, it doesn’t matter, no game is worth £214.12 (DLC cost plus base game cost, all full price) to access all of its features, not one, ever!\n\nBuy this game when it’s on offer, but please boycott paying for what’s in the game already.  Don’t buy the commanders, even those you really want or need.  £2.99 may not sound like a lot but you can often buy a FULL game for that on a Steam offer.  You’re paying to use a single special unit that the computer can use at will.  It sucks.","April 10, 2015","false","29.9"," 1,895 of 2,375 people (80%) found this review helpful 88 people found this review funny","80","895","2","88","92"

The developers of the Eastern Front Mod took the AI from that game and actually fixed it to the point where the units use real strategy instead of blatant cheating like in Company of Heroes 2. CoH 2 AI will just call in smoke attack, after smoke attack, after smoke attack - cooldown time be damned! But there is no real strategy or adaptability. (FYI - smoke attacks are special ability artillery/bombing attacks)\n\nThe only thing worse than the AI is the fact that this game really didn't do much to improve over the first. The pathfinding is still as terrible as ever and there aren't any sort of squad formations, which if included, would limit the amount of units that get killed when the computer calls in smoke every 20 seconds. These are two basic things that games in the late 90s were able to accomplish, so it boggles my mind how CoH cannot incomproate it! On top of that, I cannot think of anything added to CoH2, except for maybe line of sight and the ability to jump over sandbags that were actual improvements over the first.\n\nLast but not least is the fact that you actually have to buy so much DLC, which is just a slap in the face to anyone who is an early adopter. "Oh, I see you paid $50.00 for our base game, here - spend another $20.00 five more times so you can get what should have been included in the original or offered at a significant discount for those who bought the original." Instead, they just have more and more bundles for people who haven't bought the game yet.\n\nOnce again - save yourself the time, money, and frustration and skip this game. Buy the original and download the FREE Eastern Front Mod. You can thank me later.\n\n(Edited for grammar and to state that I donated $25.00 to the Eastern Front Developers because they actually EARNED my money.)","November 19, 2015","false","155.0"," 515 of 660 people (78%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","78","515","660","25","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/recommended/231430/","toquina","Overkill_Ashley♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/","302 products in account","While being a sequel, Company Of Heroes 2 offers less content than the original game and has many holes that scream to be filled with future DLC releases. Many of the units simply feel like a re-skin; the Russians take the exact role the Americans did in the first game. All of the Russian units have a similar counterpart in the first game and yet CoH2 still manages to offer less variety in units than that first game, leaving certain battlefield roles completely missing.\n\nOn CoH2's day of release it already had a gigantic collection of twenty six DLC packages totaling a whopping £42. Costing more than the game itself, the downloadable content added vehicle skins and access to five unique commanders which could have simply added to standard release. Downloadable content implies you are actually paying for something, however Company Of Heroes 2 manages to charge and give nothing in return. The five commanders that can be bought offer no new abilities, just remixing the existing content within the game, only changing the orders of abilities players can spend hard earned cash without adding a single drop of new content to the experience. For pre-ordering I had access to the new co-op “missions” known as theater of war; instantly I was unable to access most of this since it will be released as future DLC. These missions are meant to have a unique co-op focus, however they did little to bring anything fresh to the game: most of these simply being a skirmish with one or two unique abilities and a smaller unit variety then a standard skirmish.\n\nThe main campaign does little to inspire beyond the first game. Consisting of fourteen missions about an hour each, they simply feel like a skirmish game except offering unique units, upgrades, and abilities which are not available during any other game mode. I found myself questioning why all of this had been removed from the other game modes. With poor dialogue, story, and boring missions that simply feel like tutorials you will feel little incentive to return for a second play-through. Multiplayer does little to improve as an unfair matchmaking system frequently creates unbalanced teams as well as giving players no choice in what they would like to play. If you want to play with random players, you lose choice over the map played as well as only having access to point control mode. Creating your own custom game denies you access to other players, and only allows you to invite friends which feels unnecessarily limiting.\n\nThe new winter maps add new mechanics to the game in which infantry become exposed to the cold and risk freezing, while random blizzards limit speed and visibility that can quickly turn heavy skirmishes into silence and small raids. This welcome and unique design can really change the battlefield while making players adapt to the new low sight conditions however it soon loses its novelty after a few games. After a few maps I soon found that blizzards simply seem to slow the game down and add to unnecessary micromanagement of units. After hearing “Your men are freezing to death” I  moved my camera to see an infantry squad stood one meter too far from a fire where they simply stood allowing themselves to freeze to death. After this happened a few times while I focused on the battle it just made winter maps soon feel like additional and unneeded “busy work.” With no other new game mechanics besides additional “busy work” it brings into question, “why should I choose Company of Heroes 2 over the first?”\n\nWith the combat mechanics remaining the same of the first game I expected to find myself playing an almost identical game to the original but with additional content. However, after playing against the AI on many skirmish maps I soon realized that my choices were significantly more limited. All of the maps are very open, with little to no choke points to really plan any defensive tactics: I soon found myself getting slaughtered if I ever tried to play defensively.  Defenses soon become useless as they are now easily flanked by speeding armor or even basic the infantry squad which pushes all players to play aggressively and use almost identical tactics. Do you like to play defensively and push forwards inch by inch? Tough luck. Want to focus mostly on support infantry? Tough luck. The only way you can win is tanks, immune to most damage and with all anti-tank weaponry so easily flanked. Every match becomes a race to build the first tank and with Germany armor being superior to the soviets in every possible way, except mobility, the Germans have a significant advantage on all maps.\n\nDuring a match you will eventually earn your first command point, giving you access to your custom selected commanders with each having five traits. At least one of these will be a passive ability that will add little to nothing to the battlefield. Two points will often give you access to unique units, with only two semi-unique units per commander it hardly changes how you decide to play against your opponent. Often these unique units are shared between many possible commanders further removing any roles or unique identity on the battlefield. Everyone builds the same units, everyone is forced to play the same aggressive tactics and as a result every game ends up playing out like the previous one. Losing teams do not have any chance to retake the battlefield against aggressive players and the winning team within the game can be seen within the first five minutes.\n\nPros:\n+good campaign length of around ten or more hours\n+action focused RTS appeals to those who are not interested in most RTS games\n+weather elements are impressive for the first few game\n+cinematic combat provides impressive sights\n\nCons:\n-a complete downgrade of the first game\n-high system requirements\n-overpriced and unnecessary release DLC, with more to come!\n-winning with defensive or support roles is impossible\n-the new commander system makes every battle the same\n-poor multiplayer system, removing all choice from players\n-predictable campaign story does nothing to entice the player\n-no reason to ever replay the campaign missions\n-content available for campaign but denied in all other game modes\n-skirmish and multiplayer maps offer no chance for a losing team to fight back\n\nCompany of Heroes 2 remains a good game, the fun action-orientated strategy game remains satisfying and intense while able to appeal to players that are not familiar to the RTS genre. Though still an enjoyable experience it is a complete downgrade from the first release back in 2006. Seven years later fans are left with an overpriced game. DLC, and less content than the first release for a small graphical update. For these reasons I would not recommend CoH2 to those interested as the unique gameplay the game has to offer should look to the original Company of Heroes instead.\n\nEnjoy the read?

To you I say that 75% of those TOTAL hours has been farming for War Spoils, which you will learn about further down in the review.\n\nHonestly buy Company of Heroes 1 with all of the DLC and you will have this game but with less visual fidelity but FAR better gameplay and on top of that more polish and less heavy handed DLC peddling.  The campaign is fine though there is one mission in particular that honestly I could have done without.  The game itself and the core mechanics are no longer what they were in COH, they are stripped and resold as overpriced DLC.  Add to that the fact that the developers have simply given up on this project or rather fixing it and have instead taken the EA road of putting DLC on the fast track priority list.  The engine has some serious issue and regardless of your rig's capability it will chug every time for the most ridiculous reasons if ANY reasons at all, it is simply a poorly optimized mess that the developers continue to screw with and make worse.  While I'm not the only one complaining about how poorly this game runs my current PC meets or exceeds the RECOMENDED specs for this game yet I have nothing but trouble with it and that’s running most graphics settings on low or medium!  The glaring game engine problems don't just stop when you leave the match, the game has a serious issue with "forgetting" your graphical settings whenever the hell it feels like it.  You'll boot up a match quickly after taking a few weeks off and you get into the match and you realize the game resolution is set to 66% and low on all settings, whoever at Relic designed the game this way needs to be fired because this in the year 2015 is inexcusable.\n\nYour unit’s AI has to be some of the most sub par that has ever been put into an RTS game that I have ever seen, the COH path finding is legendary by now because of how poorly your units navigate the map.  It was significant in COH1 but in 2 there appear to be no fixes or updates to the AI and on top of that they continue to make the same countless mistakes that will get themselves killed.  Retreating units often go out of their way to make wide paths of retreat INTO enemy lines rather then back through areas which were cleared.  Another step back in this title compared to the first one was that if a grenade lands next to a squad of infantry they will stand on it and end up killing an entire squad, where as in COH1 at times the AI would automatically spread out a bit in order to mitigate the damage done to the squad.  Tanks regularly show their rear and side armor when retreating or maneuvering around which also happened in COH1 but again you’d expect IMPROVEMENTS for a full priced second title but alas there are few if any.\n\nThe advertized "feature" the Relic likes to tout in this game is the "true sight" which on paper means that your units can't just see through the fog of war within their normal vision radius.  Well in practice it is VERY different, a full squad of 5 or 6 infantry units can not see around a 1 foot wide tree with no under growing branching on its trunk.  That single bush that most people would be able to see right though? Yeah apparently the people that Relic hire are outright blind or have extreme cases of near sightedness because squads and vehicles can literally be only small bushes or singular trees apart and they will never know.  None of this is an exaggeration mind you; you can hide an entire squad or armored column behind a single fern. This also extends to all unit vision cones which are lacking even more so then they were in COH1; that dedicated long range tank hunter that should be used at long range, yeah it has the visual range of a new born child.\n\nRelic-SEGA changed the rank rewards and changed them over to something they called "War Spoils" which is a completely RNG system with no way to reliably get anything let alone something that should have been unlocked upon purchase.  Doctrines are now locked behind what is essentially a pay wall because unless you want to grind for quite literally thousands of hours just to get a single doctrine or camo then you'll have to fork over some serious cash.  The best part besides the system being so obviously designed to push players to give up and BUY what they are in essence owed is that the loot system can also drop duplicates which are utterly useless as there is no way to combine or sell them off for something slightly more useful.  So on top of the system being totally fixed and random you also can get I've seen players complain about having 5 of a single bulletin or more and you have no uses for multiples past 3 even then it takes up that loot space that could have been something better.  It is an absolute Scheme that was calculated for the benefits of Relic-SEGA and not the players who bought the game.  The fact that this system was added a year or two AFTER the game was actually released proves this to be quite the obvious fact.  They have made no attempts to fix the glaring issues despite a now 84 page thread about the subject.  The "War Spoils" system is so inconsistant and obviously broken that you will get one player who gets nothing but Doctrins, skins nd rare everything while others get almost nothing even after grinding for DAYS at a time all to unlock something that came WITH the game.  The evidence of this is in this single thread that a mod put up to cut down on the amount of complaints about the loot system: http://steamcommunity.com/app/231430/discussions/0/43099711972537578/\nKeep in mind future buyer, that any of the Doctrine/Commander, camos and such are already bought and paid for when you purchased the game or the US/OKW DLC.  They are NOT EXTRA DLC, Relic/SEGA is hiding the content that we already paid for behind an extremely unforgiving grind wall or a pay wall.\n\nIs there more stuff to do and just more content then COH sure but it comes at the cost of gameplay balances, game stability and and overpriced paywall or just a paywall PERIOD.  I am honestly not sure what happened to the Relic I knew, the Relic who made the Homeworld series but this new Relic is filled with nothing but the worst kind of people for developing games, a shell of its former self for certain.

I find the excess of DLC annoying. The thought that I have to grind away for about two hours every gaming session at the least to have a very slim chance of maybe getting a paid commander through the was spoils system that sells for $3.99 is depressing. (Sales are your friend if you really, really want these)\n\n2. The single player campaign bored me to hell. Others might have enjoyed it, I didn't. I was disappointed, disinterested, and saw no reason to replay it after one run. It felt like a history circus cartoon, seeing Tiger tanks in Stalingrad and sappy drama instead of a narrative atmosphere that made me feel like I was up front and center in a war.\n\n3. Multiplayer is a mix. If you've got friends you can have a great time, but if you're thinking of getting this game as a single purchase you may find yourself struggling to learn all the skills and counters necessary to be a competitor online (If you're like me and don't like losing all that much). Unfortunately there isn't an official tutorial and the campaign doesn't pressure you to take action and micro the same way multiplayer does, so playing it does not teach you the ropes of multiplayer. The ranking system, which I put most of my game time into, does not offer any rewards for grinding away for higher rank. And when you're at max level, that's it. Have a cookie.\n\nI admit I like that patches for multiplayer come fairly frequently, so there's not too much bad to be said about multiplayer. It's not great without friends, though.\n\n4. The game did not stick with its theme. I get it, I suppose. Making more factions means appealing to a larger, broader audience with an American and British army, but when it gets to the point that the original factions sit on old abilities and units that have their roles displaced or scrambled by a flux of new units for new armies (you have to pay for commanders too to get ALL the new units for the new armies, lol. Buy the army so you can buy DLC for the army, hehe) then there's something not quite right.\n\nUnit variety in terms of infantry and armor is also pretty bland. Comon. 15 units on average for a faction? (Not counting additional ones you can get by using paid commanders. They usually only add 1 or 2 more, anyways)\n\nSo, I bought this game with the interest in walking through an epic historical narrative about the Eastern Front in single player and being able to do some sweet tactical uraaaaah with varied Soviet Armor and Infantry in multiplayer. I was disappointed.\n\nTotal cash paid: A small cashout of about $100","October 1, 2015","false","647.2"," 161 of 201 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","161","201","6","12"

I am a huge fan of the Company of Heroes franchise, and I have put many hundreds of hours into CoH1 both before and after if went on Steam. Not everything that the nay-sayers is wrong, but the amount of negative attention this game is getting is unfair to it, and I think that anyone who was a fan of VCoH should give it a chance.\n\nFirst, I will say that the game mechanics are nothing but improved. Infantry AI is much better, units can no longer be run over by a stray tank and destroy entire squads. Tanks can no longer just roll over an opponent without being supported. Infantry anti-tank abilities (available on all factions core units except the Oberkommando West) will very often damage a vehicles engine, slowing it down to the point where other anti-vehicle weapons can easily take them out. Artillery is dumbed down from the first game, with only a handful of on-map artillery options available. You will not be able to park calliopes outside of your opponents base and win the game with long range barrage weapons. These are all, in my eyes, improvements and make for a more exciting, balanced game.\n\nNavigating the game maps is slightly different now as well. A few things that stood out is how much less important bridges are. Terror doctrine in VCoH could esentially pick a bridge, firebomb it, and destroy it on demand if the munitions were availbable. Now, alternate (but less convenient) routes to the front are almost always available, and bridges can even be repaired before they are destroyed. Infantry can vault over low walls and obstacles too, which is just one more tool available to the player to get to the fight (or away from it) swifter. This also means troops can no longer be trapped on the wrong side of a sandbag wall, they can simply jump over to the other side. This is true for trenches as well, they can leap in and jump out without using the main entrance.\n\n(EDIT-WINTER MAPS REMOVED)  While winter maps were not 100% removed, blizzard effects were removed on all maps. There are still places where you can fight in frozen conditions with heavy snow littering the ground and ice covering waterways, making new avenues for attack that are not present in summer. The removal of blizzards was a good decision on Relics part and shows how this game is still growing and changing. Blizzards allowed for very static gameplay by slowing down all units and encouraging long-range units to sit and camp, whereas the rest of the game demands that your forces be in constant motion, and the faster you can move the better.\n\nThe true line of sight concept I mentioned is also a new improvement to the formula. Units can only see what is in front of them, and can no longer draw line of sight through walls, buildings, enemy vehicles, or smoke clouds, making smoke much more useful than it was in VCoH. This makes setting up ambushes and scouting considerably more important and exciting. It is a good feeling for an enemy tank to roll around a corner, only to find out that an infantry squad and an AT gun are in extremely close proximity to it. The infantry squad will almost certainly slow the vehicle with an AT grenade or panzerfaust, and the AT gun will take care of the rest.\n\nBut not all was good on the eastern front, and the game did have the flaw of an overabuse of paid DLC. Relic has listened to its fans, and there is no more paid DLC commanders/skins/bulletins (the three prevalent multiplayer unlocks) that you cannot unlock by playing the game. Company of Heroes 2: Armies of the Western Front, unveiled a concept of "War Spoils", a stystem where players will earn random commanders, bulletins (which are static buffs for a specific unit type), and skins simply by playing for a set amount of time. War Spoils is a good idea, but it is poorly executed as the player does not have control over the drops they are getting. If you want to unlock a specific commander, it is very likely you will unlock three different commanders, four skins, and countless bulletins before you get the one you want. You also do not know how much you are progressing towards your next drop, and it does not seem to be connected to win/loss rating.\n\nStill, this formula is a radical improvement over buying those fancy commanders. If you want to play around with new units and tactics, now all you have to do is play more in stead of breaking your wallet out. Want to unlock that German winter camo for your heavy tanks? Better go kill more Communists. Blow up your opponent in style for the low low price of... who knows how much time spent playing the game you bought! The war spoils system is nice, but ultimately I think people will still pay for commanders rather than work for them, as it can take some time. A good improvement on this system would be making it so you can choose what to work towards unlocking as well as the elimination of duplicate war spoils drops, which are by and large useless with the exception of certain bulletins, though even most duplicate bulletins do not function.\n\nAll this aside, the game itself is well worth its cost, and is definitely worth looking into for any Company of Heroes veteran, or anyone interested in real time strategy games or World War II history. Armies of the Western Front adds the OKW and American forces into the game, and both these armies bring new soldiers and vehicles (not to mention commanders) to the table, and demand new strategies from Whermacht and Soviet players to combat them. The unit emotes are all great, the sound effects are nice and authentic, and the checks and balances of the game make you end up using every weapon in your arsenal to crush your opponent, resulting in good-looking, authentic armies. The gameplay is fun, it is pretty, the auto-matching multiplayer will usually find you games in less than a minute, and the multiplayer is competitive and diverse enough to keep you coming back. I give it a 9.5 out of 10 and highly reccomend this game.\n\n[EDIT 12/26/15] A lot has changed in this game since I originally wrote this review. I have tried to go back over it and change content as is necessary, but tried to maintain its intergrity. The biggest differences are the removal of blizzards on winter maps, the overhaul to the OKW, which was a good idea but still needs some work as of this edit, and the introduction of the British forces in multiplayer, which brought a lot of new units to the table and changed the games balance.","January 22, 2014","true","843.4"," 852 of 1,195 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","852","1","0","30"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uranium235/recommended/231430/","Uranium235","Frostiken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uranium235/","321 products in account","Somehow this game just ends up not being very much fun, at least from a single player standpoint. The campaign missions are long, dull, and repetitive. Before you get done with even the fifth mission you'll have grown tired of the 'capture a point, now hold it against near-infinite waves of enemies' trick. And spoiler alert: that isn't getting worn out anytime soon. You play that out in the second, fourth, fifth, sixth, etc. etc. etc.\n\nNow, we're supposed to be playing as the Red Army, the force that historically and infamously used mass wave tactics to victory. Thus, the gameplay just feels ridiculous when the German forces are the ones who are throwing waves of bodies, while the player is limited to the triumphant return of the utterly silly population limiter. The population limits wouldn't even be that bad, but we're also still dealing with completely inflexible squads. Let's say you have four free population, but want to call in a conscript squad. Well you need six for that. Got four guys on a machine gun? You have to use grenades to frag your own troops to bring them down to just two people so you can free up six population to call your conscripts.\n\nThe game relies heavily on 'artificial difficulty'. There's no strategy to be found in the campaign. The enemy doesn't build units and send them to attack you. The missions exist in two states - in the first state, the gameplay is completley static. Enemies don't attack, and you have all the time in the world to slowly creep your way across the map. In the second state, you're facing the infinite waves of enemies, as you try to hold three points with two squads against literally HUNDREDS of enemies. That's it. That's the gameplay. Any sort of 'tricks' the AI has up its sleeve is entirely limited to scripted sequences. You attack a point, and a wall collapses and a tank drives through. Not because the AI has a tank and it's using it, but because the developers decided to make the game 'hard' by having you fight tanks with infantry. This is further compounded by the fact that they constantly 'turn off' the tech trees as you play. In mission 5, where you liberate Stalingrad, you have access to halftracks, T-34 tanks, and rocket launchers. In mission 6, where you clean up Stalingrad (and you also have to face - again - waves of armor and troops) they take away everything except your infantry. Again: artificial difficulty. The AI is terrible, so in order to make it 'hard' we're just going to arbitrarially force you to fight what might as well be Leopard 2 tanks and Eurofighters with broomsticks and rocks.\n\nMy favorite example of this is the sixth 'secure Stalingrad' mission. The only anti-armor weapons you get are anti-tank grenades and anti-tank guns. The enemy has a freaking flamethrower halftrack. It impossibly takes over four head-on hits with a 76mm anti-tank cannon to destroy it (because halftracks are known for their armor?), so it just drives up, flamethrowers your gun crew and kills them instantly, and then burns all your infantry to death, and drives away.\n\nIt's not a bad game, but it does absolutely NOTHING interesting or new, and it very much begins to feel like they just copy-pasted one level to the next. I'm not joking about that 'hold out against waves of enemies' thing being used on almost every single level either. This is World War 2, not Orcs Must Die. Not every battle was spent fighting as the underdog against waves of troops. The Germans get tanks in almost every mission, I'm lucky if I even get halftracks. There's almost no options for static defenses anymore either.\n\nI normally am a huge fan of Relic games, but this is such a bland, uninspired offering that I'm giving it a thumbs-down.","July 13, 2015","false","45.6"," 371 of 528 people (70%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","70","371","528","21","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Manducabulla/recommended/231430/","Manducabulla","«Manducabulla»","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Manducabulla/","49 products in account","This game doesn't deserve the ratings it has and I'll explain why. To me it is half a game. It is fine if you want to play the singleplayer, or 1v1 or 2v2 multiplayer. If you are someone who would prefer a competitive 3v3 or 4v4 game mode then I would pass on COH2.\n\nIt all comes down to balance, and while most strategy games have some trouble with balance, COH2 has taken it to a new level. The WL ratio of 4v4 games has been in favor of the axis by quite a large amount for as far as I can remember, to the point of absurdity. I'm not overexaggerating this either, you can look up charts and graphs for stats on COH2 on google and you will see how imbalanced it is on larger game modes. You WILL lose more games than you win if you want to play the allied factions in larger game modes, I guess it is great if you want to play Axis, which a majority of 4v4 players do. So if you are at all competitive and wish to play Allied factions in the larger game modes, don't buy this game.\n\nBlobbing is also a problem in this game that bills itself as a strategy. Blobbing happens when you gather up all of your units, most of them of the same type, and send them across the map in a giant blob. Hardly strategic. Shrek blobs are blobs of rpg toting Nazi's that have been a problem for quite some time. They can kill everything, are a nightmare to deal with, and have helped skew the WL ratio the way it is. Blobbing is a problem across all factions though, and Relic have taken some tiny stabs at combating the problem, but they haven't done nearly enough. Of course blobbing is mostly found in larger game modes.\n\nWhat is probably the worst thing about all of this is that Relic has proven that they don't care about the larger game modes or the people who like to play them. That is even despite 4v4 being one of the most popular game modes. It has been two years since this game launched and still, these problems remain. In my understanding they haven't even acknowledged that blobbing or the WL ratio is a problem. And despite threads I've posted on reddit and on their own forums, I can't even get anybody to comment on it. For all the roadmap and their perceived "communication with the playerbase". Relic has even said that they balance for 1v1, leaving really no doubt how they feel about half of their game, so I guess maybe it will never be balanced.\n\nThe idea that Relic does not have to balance the larger game modes is completely bizarre to me. They have an obligation to anyone who bought the game. The common excuse is that somehow they can't balance it all, it's impossible, like it has never been done before. The fact they can't balance this game into the larger game modes without a huge differential speaks of bad design decisions from the ground up. Why they even advertise 4v4 as a game mode when they won't balance it, or care about it at all, who knows.\n\nDLC is also problematic. The game has a warspoils system, wherein you are supposed to get bulletins (which are like small buffs in-game and cannot be purchased) and commanders (that decide what special units and abilities you can use) at the end of a round. Sometimes you get them sometimes you don't. It is completely random as far as I know, so you can get duplicates, you can get stuff for things you never plan to use or never have used. The commanders are $4 a piece, which is pretty pricey. Saying that you can get everything from just playing the game is a stretch, maybe if it weren't so random, you could play for a long time and get everything, but with duplicates you'd probably have to play for years upon years.\n\nThis game also doesn't have any keybinds. A strategy game without keybinds?!?! Yep, it doesn't. Even though it has been a heavily requested feature for a long time.\n\nThe community is horrible. I know that gets said about many games, but it's true. You are also unable to mute or block people in game.\n\nI can praise Relic and Sega for how they have handled DLC distribution. Maps are free to everyone (although there are not nearly enough of them), so as to not divide the player base, and even if you haven't purchased a faction, you can still play against other people playing as that faction so as to even further not divide the player base. Learning and improving, that's something we can all clap for. I hope it is something all other games adopt in the future because it really is the best way to do things.\n\nI loved COH and I've been playing COH2 since it's not so great launch. I have been a fan of Relic and I've tried to be a fan of COH2. The truth is that this is half a game. If you want the singleplayer or smaller multiplayer game modes, you'll have fun if you can look past the gouging DLC. If you are a competitive player who wants to play Allied factions in larger game modes, do not buy this game, you are wasting your money. Even if you'd like to play the Axis on larger game modes you really are wasting your money because the best games are the really tense, down to the wire ones and you hardly ever get those in 4v4.\n\nThanks for reading, I hope you found it helpful.","July 26, 2015","false","444.8"," 100 of 129 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","100","129","4","0"

Heres whats important:\n\nCommanders can randomly be dropped after a battle along with other goodies, yes the drop rate is too low and yes you can buy them but at least there is a legit way of obtaining new ones besides giving Sega more money. Look on the workshop and there are maps specifically made in mind for you to just grind out new comanders and intel bulletins. Speaking of the Workshop, for people who liked Blitzkrieg and similar mods for CoH1 there are now mods that aim to do the same things (though no actual sequel to Blitzkrieg afaik) availble for download. Get several, play around with them all until you find one you like, personally I like Spearhead the best.\n\nBack to the DLC issue: really the only ones you should buy are Western Front armies, Ardennes Assualt, and if you want the extra campaign packs. Thats it, the rest of it are skins and commanders you can unlock through normal play. Therefore if that bothers you vote with your wallet and dont buy those ones.","June 17, 2015","true","778.9"," 395 of 614 people (64%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","64","395","614","13","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/231430/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","Company of Heroes 1 was a (mostly) great game that covered the early months of the Allied war effort against Germany on D-Day and beyond. As far as RTS games go, it was superb in just about every way with my only issue coming from the "Tales of Valor"campaigns being of a far lesser quality than the original one or the two from Opposing Fronts. Also I never really played the multiplayer. I got to the game a bit late for that, and i've not been keen on RTS multiplayer since the early 2000's (Warcraft III).\n\nCoH2 had some big shoes to fill, and first impressions seemed a little mixed because of the DLC spam and the historical narrative. As a long-time player of the Total War games, I am very much aware that SEGA is among the worst offenders when it comes to having too much and too highly priced DLC. I got this game and some of it's DLC as part of a humble bundle, so I sit with most of the complete game with still some bits missing.\n\nTruthfully, all I have done in this game is the single-player campaign, so that's all I can talk about. I'd heard before playing this that Russians hate this game's campaign story with a passion, and after having played it I understand why (even if I don't entirely agree).\n\nTo try to keep this short, the Soviet Union's "Great Patriotic War" was and remains a highly politicized conflict where the official narrative is one of a hard but glorious struggle to extinguish Nazi Germany. The uglier side of the Soviet War effort is basically ignored or shouted down as lies by the uninformed and the nationalists. This game does not shy away from bringing up things that Russians would prefer to pretend didn't happen. While the whole "sending men into battle without weapons" bit was mostly BS (The USSR's war production vastly exceeded the Germans), and Order 227 "Not a step back" was a feature of the early months of the battle of Stalingrad (not the entire war after it as the game depicts), the rest is largely true. "Penal Battalions" consisting of "enemies of the state" to be thrown at the Germans (or even used as human minefield sweepers), the outright murder of Polish partisans and the USSR leaving the Warsaw Uprising to die, massive press censorship and executions, and the Soviet tendency for butchery when it finally entered Germany are all things that actually happened. I suppose Russians and Pro-Russian sympathizers should be glad that the Soviets horrific treatment of its own liberated POW's (most were considered traitors because they gave up instead of dying or becoming partisans) and the mass ♥♥♥♥ of German women are not found in this game.\n\nI'm not here to have a debate over these things. These are unpleasant facts about Soviet conduct during WW2. The US is also fond of portraying WW2 as a noble struggle against evil, but their record is hardly clean either (see Operation Keelhaul, racial segregation, the tendency towards "Terror bombing" of enemy cities, and, of course, the nukes). CoH2 might have won more friends if it didn't include things that are so politically sensitive in Russia and the former Soviet nations, but it would have been a bit disingenous as well.\n\nThough it might have helped if the game had also made more of a point of featuring the Germans own behavior on the Ostfront that rallied the Soviet people to fight back and ultimately cost Germany the war. The War in the East was a terrible example of the truth of that old saying: "You reap what you sow." A bit more focus on the fact that much of the Soviet war effort focused on revenge for German crimes might have been better.\n\nI probably shouldn't have typed all that. Sorry. History nerd who had a focus on the war between the Germans and Soviets for many years. XD\n\nSo... game. It's fine I guess? It seems fairly similar to CoH1 to me, and that was a good game. Again i've not tried the multiplayer and probably won't, so you will have to find someone else to tell you about that. But for a single-player experience covering the horrible war between the Germans and Soviets? I'd say this game is just fine. :o\n\n(I'll probably update this review on a later date once I play more of the game and feel less of a need to play history teacher.

I played a lot of this game, as you can tell by my hours. I recently came back to the game after taking more than a year off.

Tons of new commanders! $3.99 a piece! The only other thing, aside from a few minor gameplay tweaks, that they've updated in a year is the title screen - to include pop-ups and ads to buy more content. Even now, if you want the full game with all of its content, you will pay over $200 US. They hide the commander DLC on a separate store page within the game to deceive you. New buyers won't know that they actually have to pay even more to have the full experience until it's too late. Each commander, some of which are pay2win and you will need to stay competitive in the game, costs between $2.99-$4.99. This game is the most cash-grabbing pile of trash I have ever seen as long as I've been a gamer, and it's not even that good.  It's not worth $60, let alone $200.  They charge for content like it's a free to play game, but you pay full price up front, too.  Relic are so far up their own asses; I would love to see them go bankrupt from corruption.

With very little improvement between the first and second game (the graphics hardly change, something they appear to have put minimal effort into improving), I'd suggest getting the original game over #2 any day; want Russians? Download the Eastern Front mod for CoH - you get the Western Front Germans and the Americans for free.\n\nBeyond the Eastern Front Mod, the original CoH also has a very large selection of mods floating around, offering a great gaming experience for just about everyone. You can get just about the same content as CoH 2 using mods, or more of equal or even greater quality.\n\nBlitzkrieg is a particually good mod for multiplayer and skirmish matches; an overhaul touching just about every single aspect of the game making it realistic versus arcadish (CoH 2: MG42 mowing down your men? Nope. They just get pinned. On CoH: Blitzkrieg mod, all LMG/HMGs are dangerous). So called 'Realistic Stratergy' is pretty damn unrealistic, and really doesn't deserve that label.\n\nFor me, I often purchase games for the modding community and/or modding potential, so CoH2 was less attractive than the original CoH due to the lack of moddding available.\n\nThis review will probably undergo changes as mods are developed (they recently released the mod tools), though future DLC will not affect this as I have no intention of getting any.","November 15, 2014","false","13.2"," 458 of 747 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","458","747","7","20"

You can win by destroying your opponent’s base but it’s almost always more beneficial to hold specific points.\n\nThe campaign is unfortunately a bit forgettable, as it completely betrays COH's micro based gameplay. You're given a constant supply of sacrificial soldiers which remove a lot of the strategic elements of the game. The campaign doesn’t require a whole lot of skill and doesn’t offer much of a sense of accomplishment.\n\nThe narrative is somewhat interesting but it isn’t up to par with some other RTS campaigns such as Warcraft 3 or Starcraft 2.\n\nThe multiplayer is still challenging and strategic although I think the game would have benefited from having more factions to choose from as you can only play as Russia or Germany. There's also a limited selection of maps available and they aren't quite as interesting or varied as the first Company of Heroes.\n\nThe worst issue is the microtransactions, which easily add up to more than the cost of the game itself. Anything from overpowered commanders, vehicle skins, and additional missions can be purchased which should have otherwise been included in the game.\n\nOverall, it's still a fun RTS but it’s simply a shadow of the original. For a more in-depth review, here's a video I made:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217433209\n\nI’d like to note that Company of Heroes 2 isn’t a terrible game; Steam only has two options, “Recommend and “Don’t Recommend” and I would say COH2 belongs somewhere in the middle.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","January 17, 2014","false","39.8"," 918 of 1,515 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","918","1","0","59"

Please note this is my first proper review and any feedback is appreciated =).\n\nDo not be fooled by the hateful meta critic user reviews that score the game incredibly low. These are all largely due to patriotic Russians who exaggerate and claim the devlopers are Nazis as the campagin portrays the Soviet Union in a bad light. One such scene they are particularly angry about is when retreating russian soldiers are being shot down by their own machine guns. Granted Relic could have portrayed these horros of war better so that they could not be misinterpreted but they didn't set out to shame an entire nation. What the campagin really shows is the the story of the war through one man's eyes, showing the great bravey of the typical russian soldier under a ruthless poltical system and an equally terrifying invading German army. Which probably took more courage to do than that of soldiers from other countries.\n\nFor those who worry about Pay to win I can assure you it's entire nonsense. None of the new content is aimed to give players an edge in multiplayer. Obviously when it is first introduced there might be some balance issues here and there but these are quickly resolved. The idea behind DLC is to give players more varitey, be that with skins or commanders it's down to your personal preference and you are no way forced to buy it to be able to compete.\n\nI can say that although CoH2 does not possess that same unique feeling that vcoh had, it is still a remarkable and incredibly fun game that continues to get better with each passing month. I have personally played over 600 hours on the beta and current version combined and I still find new ways to play and each game is never the same. You have to remember that the orginal CoH series has had 7 years of patching and improvements whereas CoH2 has only been out for less than a year. Therefore I believe it's unfair to judge the sequel so harshly at this stage. Within that time period the developers have added a huge range of content including; Steam Workshop with user created maps and mods, offical developer created maps, new units, commanders, leaderboards, chat rooms and with plenty more on the way.\n\nNotable improvements over the original include: Better Graphics, Bulletins, Variety in choices that makes you stand out from the crowd ie commanders, skins faceplates etc, New Features like Cold Tech and True Sight which add more tactical elements. For instance you must now keep your troops warm during a blizzard by placing them near a fire or in a house otherwise they will freeze to death.\n\nNow on to the game's flaws. Currently I believe the developers are pre-occuiped in bringing out more dlc content then spending the most time balancing the game and improving performance. Fair enough that they have to make money but I'd much rather they focused on tweaking the current game first then adding dlc like theatre of war missions. The variety in commanders is great and all but loads of the abilities have been reused in other commanders which takes away the uniqueness of certain commanders. Theres still quite some work to do before it can be considered a proper ESport as the replay viewer still needs additional features however it is constantly improving. Compared to something like Starcraft 2, CoH2 just doesn't have the player base or the resources unlike blizzard. I honestly think that if relic promoted the game and advertised it properly it would have generated a lot more interested. As it happens the advertising around the launch date was literally non-existent.\n\nConclusion\n\nScore: 8/10 Current State\n\nAlthough this game has got a way to go before it can be considered to be a worthy sequel to the first, I believe that over time it will get there and even surpass it's predecessor. Relic has been listening to user feedback and many of the new features are a result of this. So if your either a fan of the old game or looking to try out a proper real time strategy then look no further. I cannot recommend this game enough.","January 1, 2014","true","298.8"," 751 of 1,240 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","751","1","0","38"

Wu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flanker1985/","174 products in account","A tragically failure of the Company of Heroes series.\nFactions are unbalanced and have bugs come out of their ears. And if you check the changelog of the patch of this game, you real found that there is one faction have been weakened every single time and it is very rarely strengthened through the patch. You can go have a look for yourself.\nPlus the AI only have an average IQ of 20. Sometime when you ask them to move to certain place, they will deliberately pick the long way around even if there are more enemies to encounter. And sometimes they turn left and right, cant' decide which road to take.\n\nAnother AI issue for example if you put your unit near an enemy unit which is not a threat to you, a building for example which can't shoot back. Without giving them order to attack, they will automatically attack that building. There is nothing wrong with that. But after that, if there is an enemy unit that come along which can be a threat to you, a tank for example, your units will NOT turn back an engage the threat and continue to attack the non-threat target unless you give the order, even though you didn't give the order to attack the non-threat to begin with.\n\nAlso all AI players will eventually stop their movement if the game last for a while, let's say about half an hour. Making the game unendable. Because your allies will not attack and you will end up as the only player advancing to your enemy. And you will never beat your opponent due to the sheel number of your opponent. So far this bug has not been addressed.\n\nThe Sega's approach to bug report is also an issue. Unlike the EA, your bug usually can be solved by a live chat on spot. The Sega support only offers contact through your Sega account by posting an issue directly to Sega technical support staff. They usually only respond you about once per day or 2. And they rarely solve your problem. Sometimes they ask me questions that I have explained twice in my previous posts. It almost feel like some kind of Phone Sex Text. Except they don't get your money based on each text. So why would they ask you questions that you have explained before is a mystery. Probably pretending that they are working on it, or probably they never worked on it and forgot what you have said earlier.\n\nI have been trying to find out a way to overcome issues like unbalance and stupid AI issues. So far, no luck.\n\nAnd many unethical practics in this game's making. For example, when I pre-ordered this game, they told me that if I pre-order the collector's edition, the future 3 threater of the war DLC will be free for me. But after game was released, they told us that they have changed their minds and only the first threater of the war DLC will be free and we have to pay for the rest like everyone else.\n\n\n\nSecondly, this game is a pay to win game to start with. In the earlier stage of this game, it advertise many different commanders who provide you different exotic units to use in the game. After you bought those, they suddenly turn this game into a mod friendly game, which everyone can make mods include "All units mod". Once again make you spend your money for nothing.\n\n\nJust check on the "only negative review" button and you will see there are clearly way many more players who gave this game a thumbs down than players who gave it a thumbs up.\nAnd as far as I know, the Sega have been paying people (mostly their employees) to give this game a better review. One evident to support my claim here is that if you check some of those people who have wrote a possitive review, they own no game but Company of Heroes 2. And some of them has no gaming hours or very few hours. And if you check their profile, some of them joined steam of this game's release and own no game but this, and in the same time they played very few hours of this game and wrote a very good review and then, they never come online on steam again, as if they only bought the game and registered steam account just to write their reviews.","September 24, 2014","false","689.2"," 161 of 254 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","161","254","4","14"

It deserve more love. I played Starcraft: brood wars for multiple years, I was very good at it. Same for Warcraft 3. I played a fair amount of time of Starcraft 2 as well but COH 2 really did put Starcraft 2 in the trash for me if we talk of the same era of time.\n\nIt's more fun\nMore tactical\nMore intense\nA good games against opponent of the same level can last 1 hour\nMore new (yeah sc2 is way too much like sc1 and i played enough year of it, why they did not made something more refreshing..)\n\nI will play this game until COH 3 come out even if it take 8 years, just like Brood war did it.\n\nMost of the bad reviews about this game been made during the early days of the come out with the bugs etc. This game keep getting patched and balanced after 2 years. Its completely another game now in term of game play.\n\nYou can now get the hand on this game when it is in sale for about 10$ If you love RTS. It will be the best 10$ invested ever. Dont forget to pick up the extension at the same time while it is in sale.\n\nSee you in the game and good luck :P\n\nAnswers to comments:\n\nFor those who said it's more than 10$ investment on this game. Well... I mentionned 10$ because it is the entry price to play the game. Obviously if you enjoy the game you will want to add more faction but once again when it is on sale WFA which include 2 faction is only 5$.\n\nYou can even just buy WFA for 5$ to try this nice game since its a stand alone. That's amazingly cheap for what you get.\n\nRelic are not stupid, they know that if you try the game and love RTS you will love it and buy the new content when they come out. at only a 20% discount like the new British faction comming out in 1 month. Thats how they make their money.\n\nI just pre-ordered the British faction myself, i could have wait 6 months to get it on sale of 50-75% but i think the 10$ entry price for it is fair. They keep the game up to date with new content.\n\nI have bought 2 commander at about 1.25$ each before they implemented the War spoils system. I have no plan to buy more commanders. I play a fair enough amount of time to hope to get the one im missing from the war spoils. The commander that are not included are not stronger anyway, they are just adding content to a nice game.\n\nSomeone who would want everything to maximize his fun would only need the 5 faction (the fifth will be out in september 2015) and i'm sure that at the xmas sale 2015, buyin all of them will be 20$. We are no way near the exagaration as some people may have mentionned in their review. If these guys cant afford to pay 20$ for full content, they should just play free to play game like Dota. Who cares of skins anyway, they dont make the games more fun and the you can still get them from war spoils drops.","February 18, 2015","true","035.5"," 200 of 321 people (62%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","62","200","321","11","7"

Since the last three major updates, the game still goes through massive ring around the nerf hammer which hits Axis forces more often than Allied forces which means if you were looking to play as Axis a lot, prepare to be dissapointed in most logical situations.\n\nThere is no historical balance or logic to the combat mechanics of the game and instead relies heavily on an RNG mechanic for "to hit" "damage dealt" "cover saves" and "armor saves" which means even if your unit is incapable of realistically damaging the target, chances are you still can and vice versa.\n\nA great example of this is dedicated anti-tank units and self propelled guns taking multiple hits to destroy light vehicles, normally the same for all units regardless of vehicle class. IE: Jagdpanther Veterancy 5 can hit a light scout car and deal only 50% of its hp threshold in damage yet on a frontal armour penetration against a T-34/85 it can deal almost 60%. Logical? Not in the slightest.\n\nIf you play against the AI, it has access to all doctrines at the same time but does a very good job of hiding this unless you pay attention to the globals it uses. For example the Russian AI will almost always have access to Propaganda Artillery Strikes even if the Commander they use doesn't have access to it. When playing against the AI, it's recommended you use one of the "All Unit" mods which at least make the game somewhat fair and balanced.\n\nWhen playing competitively, it's best to just do smaller player counts because most factions are not balanced on late tier games seen in 3v3s and 4v4s in which certain factions are punished heavily such as the USForces only having one premium doctrine that has a heavy tank compared to all the OKW and Heer having access to multiple heavy tanks regardless of doctrine.\n\nCertain units are still bugged such as the crewing and recrewing of abandoned units on certain maps will result in the unit disappearing and being unable to be commanded, destroyed, or pulled out of combat. While rare, it's still in the game and it was a problem since beta two years ago. Tanks still can't aim on elevation which means if you want to really ♥♥♥♥ someone off, go up a hill and shoot down, 90% of all shots unless the player decides to manually control will go straight into the ground right in front of said vehicle.\n\nOnly buy this game when it is on sale for 60-80% off. If you are smart, don't buy any of the DLC unless it's 75% off or more. There is occasional free commanders at different times of the year so if you are patient, you can rack up some decent ones in addition to random drops. (Which don't even give you drops to your faction half the time.)","August 14, 2014","false","332.8"," 79 of 121 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","79","121","0","4"

I just cant seem to put it away in favor of other games.\nIt has been my game of choice since the night of release in june 2013, and I dont see that changing anyitme soon.\nTo address common issues:\nThe balance can be bad, but only at the highest levels. Before that point, its a matter of learning how to play.\n\nThe bugs can be NotLikeThis FeelsBadMan too, but for the most part relic is currently actively working on or has fixed alot of them, there are no game breaking bugs at the moment.\n\nThe game is still regularly patched, so if there are issues they are usually fixed.\n\nThe optimization, well dont play on a potato and you should be fine. I never had an issue with optimization. During my first year and a half of play, I played on a ♥♥♥♥in' potato laptop and I had to run the game on minimum. I got a job, bought a computer that didnt suck, and I can run the game on high just fine. I can even play on maximum/highest if I want to sacrifice some frames.\n\nYou'll likely have to run the game on medium- minimum settings if you want perfect FPS, or if your computer isnt the best. To be honest, the game on minimum still has beautiful visuals. Especially in comparison to other RTS games.  Its critically acclaimed company of heroes at its core, after all.\n\nMatchmaking is bad you say? Play during european hours an you should have no problems finding games at your level and in a timely manner. Your first 10 games will likely be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they're placement matches to find your play-level. Just stick with it and learn. Coh2 was my first online RTS, and I'd say im doing pretty fine nowadays, even though I struggled out the gate.\n\n\nThe campaign was released 3 years ago. So if it still hurts your feelings, and you're a compstomp scrub, L2P multiplayer already. I can help you. just add me.\n\nTOW is not updated, and was basically dropped.\nhowever if you insist on being a comp stomp n00b then modding is fun, if youre into it.\nArdeneess assault i wouldve given a 3/10 for its cost a year or so ago, but since its much cheaper now its a fun playthorugh for what it costs.\n\nAll in all, coh2 is a solid 9/10 would play again.

You know how there are several DLC factions? Well guess what, in order to get some of the commanders, you have to cash out to get them in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in-game store. Why on earth would you add microtransactions to a game people already have paid for?

I realize review is outdated, so proceed at your own risque. I did not edit the text below and I did not have the urge to return into game despite hearing lots of things (both good and bad, last patch WAS GENUINELY BAD THOUGH, EVERYONE WHO THINKS OTHERWISE IS NOT UNBIASED SANE PERSON, really, changing OKW resources penalties to zero, taking kubel suppression away (hey, faction has no other standart suppression units, have fun with controlling the blobs) and making other QUESTIONABLE balance changes (again, as I stated below, I'm no cold-hearted numbers-thinking expert, I just describe my feels as player, well, former player).\nPS. Also bear in mind that Relic is not the same developer who brought you Dawn of War and CoH, they had major staff reshuffles, even after that big thing with THQ bankrupcy.\n\nFolks, please, THINK before you HYPE.\n\nThis here is a perfect example of anti-fun. And I am not even talking about balance. Or rough bulletin system. Or harsh matchmaking. It's bugs+random, plain and simple. Because it gets really, REALLY frustrating when you shoot down an aircraft and it lands on your troops with most lethal results that artillery corps can't even dream of; or when you can't do ♥♥♥♥ about enemy Half-Track with your anti-tank guns, but your anti-tank gun gets ♥♥♥♥♥slapped by MG with armor-piercing rounds (yeah, Jackson, I'm talking about you): or you can't demolish T-70 Light Tank with 5 shots in rear armor, because the main gun breaks instead; or when cover system screws up and squad is placed in negative cover which wasn't there a second ago; or when retreats go though the middle of opposing force; or sniper misses ten shots in a row; or Ivan throws the bottle not upwards but under his foot being a german spy all along, I assume. Ugh.\n\nHad to make an update about me and RTS games and potential assumptions about my low skill level. Hey, surprise, I'm not GOOD at RTS, I'm what you call an average player. So yeah, the point of me painfully playing this game in multiplayer was learning something from better player. Theorycraft here usually helps, but due to commander system and lack of good wiki (srsly, the only one non-outdated I could find was japanese, what kind of sorcery is this) won't help you - you'll have to watch streams and replays, which some reviews suggest. And I watched. And, hey, folks there are often sound infuriated because of the same reason of randomness and bugs, but they have skill and that helps them win the game despite the Gods of Random will, THAT kind of skill, neither I, nor you, if you wanna buy this game, won't have. Hell, I even have been placed against the persons whose streams I watched on a couple of accasions (which is kinda creeping me out considering my in-game amount of time). Oh, I promised not to talk about matchmaking. Shutting up now.\n\nI've won my fair share of fights, even versus players better than me. But then again, it was thanks to same randomness. For some reason my grenades oneshot obersoldaten, or my mortars were unnaturely accurate, or my panic AT grenade utterly destroyed the engine of a Tiger Tank which let me easily deal with that wunder of Teutonic engineering.\n\nSo, I do not enjoy an emotional torture this game provides. It is a perfect simulation of horrors and chaos of WWII (which is kinda funny, because devs were working on Dawn of War series, featuring mentioned chaos and horrors).

This happens especially with the allies since almost all of the more experienced players choose the axis factions (because they have units and abilities that really overperformes compared to the allied conterparts), left on the allied side are only the newbies that have barely played the game.\n\nYes, I know, this game can be really awesome at times (by far best RTS game I have played), but these two things I mentioned makes the multiplayer experience... not so good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gigmajor/recommended/231430/","gigmajor","Hérétique","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gigmajor/","708 products in account","Post British Forces Version:\n\n75% of games have droppers, balance is garbage.\n\nPost-battle server version:\n\nTechnically, the game is functional now. No lag. There is still a very minor order delay, but that is a minor gripe. It still drops randomly, but far less than before. I was about to give a positive review, and then...\n\nI had players actually send their units to destroy my munitions points because they thought they were going to take on Panthers with T34/76s, and then they didn't make any tanks. And then I didn't have any munitions to launch air raids or use satchel charges or flares. And then we lost. Tigers and Panthers all over the field and not a single Zis-76mm that wasn't mine(they are probably the best AT gun since they are cheap, recoverable and cause horrid levels of tank loss when staggered). Plenty of mortars. There was also that time when I was backing away from a firefight and my ally decided to throw a satchel charge at my soldiers. Take a guess at the result. I feel that this is a bad time to bring up the blame-shifting, but I personally acknowledge that I am not the best player and that I make mistakes. I can deal with poor players if they put in an effort. I can't deal with those who are not only bad players but refuse to acknowledge that they are playing with others. Trash talk is one thing, the stuff that goes on in this game is another.\n\nIf you can stand people who like to blame each other for everything and engage in sociopathic behavior, go ahead. I have never seen a community quite as bad as this one, aside from maybe DOTA2.\n\nI want to take a final swipe at the way the game handles command trees. Choosing from 3 commaders is great, but setting those commanders' traits in stone makes it impossible to adapt. This was done to allow for the sale of pricey DLC, and thus it will never be rectified. I can tolerate cosmetic DLC, but this type of DLC actually makes the game worse. Bulletins are near worthless unless you pick a single unit to improve.\n\nThe pathfinding is still very bad. Troops will often refuse to move or withdraw. Pebbles block line of sight for snipers. In many cases, the models will run OUT OF COVER towards machine guns or an explosive they just threw. I am at a loss as to why this occurs.\n\nHad time to cool off version:\n\nThis game is pretty tolerable lag-wise when playing with friends and I am tempted to recommend it, but you should not be forced to bother other people just to get a game to work properly. In addition, there should be a requirement where you should reach rank 10 or something before you go online to ruin other people's matches.\n\n"Oh", you say. "It's just a game. Just try to have fun." I ABSOLUTELY agree. However, tell me how I am supposed to have fun when some person on my team does things like being afk the entire match, sit around and build conscripts all day without leaving base, or just being really rude and arrogant when other players gently try to help them play less horribly. Honestly, the ♥♥♥♥ I've seen. Sure, I've seen the standard noob move or setting-and-forgetting mortar teams so that they make it impossible for me to recap. I've also dealt with odd wire placement or sending single tanks to their deaths. I've also dealt with people doing nothing but building firepits and barbed wire in the middle of base. I once had an ally who somehow managed to abandon two tanks to the enemy. One time, I had an ally build barbed wire on the area where the units spawn, making it IMPOSSIBLE to call in new squads without spending the time and effort to remove it. I have NO idea why they thought this was a good idea.\n\nShort Version:\n\nThe game lags a lot. The graphical requirements are extremely high considering the rather unimpressive visuals. Drops occur nearly every match. The game does not reward positive behavior (gameplay or otherwise) and rewards players with rank ups no matter how horrid they play. The matchmaking system is broken, and often pairs stacked teams or connecting you to someone on the other side of the planet. German technology is too cheap considering how much better it is. It is not possible to leave a match without leaving the game. Excessive DLC. Even though most of it are cosmetic, there is more material in the DLC than there is in the game, leading me to believe that they focus more on the DLC than fixing the broken netcode.\n\nGreat ideas, but the game is just broken.\n\n$5 bargin bin material.\n\nLong Version:\n\nI am not going to say anything about single player, but I will say the following:\n\nRelic has no idea how to program netcode. There is no excuse to release a product in this form, and keep it in this form six months later. There is nothing but lag. Half of the players drop, and the other half are just jerks. Soviet tanks are still a joke and pathfinding is worse than ever before. The game is just a fuel rush.\n\nIt also has a hilarious habit of just ceasing to function when it wants to update. The game just cuts off.\n\nYou want to know why it lags? Because it was optimised so well, that you can barely notice where the graphic work went when the game runs 45 fps on a Geforce TITAN. "Oh", says the guy willing to spend $2000 for 2 Titans, "I can just use an SLI setup and have multiple cards run at the same time." Nope. Much like it does not support anything else, the game does not support SLI.\n\nYou want to know why games like CS:GO and Dota 2 do so well? Because they are AWARE. They are aware that not everyone can afford top-of-the-line PCs, so they didn't release a product that was not at all optimized. Then you have CoH2 on the opposite side of the spectrum.\n\nI heard this game sold over a quarter of a million copies. Apparently Relic thought that they spent all the money for a 3-hour campaign. SURELY the MULTIPLAYER DLC that they are pumping out may have been indicative of some sort of effort to make the game run better. Obviously not since this game barely peaks at 5000 on a good day. 5000. Out of over a quarter million. And they are selling multiplayer DLC.\n\nThe commander DLC is the worst. It is not really required, but five dollars for a commander is totally absurd. That's more than the standard price for the southern fronts DLC. They could at least make an good package with ALL the DLC. You can't even find the commander DLC without digging for it. Here is the link:\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/sale/Company_of_Heroes_2_Commanders?l=english\n\nSure the game peaks out again whent the game is massively discounted. Then it bottoms out even further because of all the people with inferior PCs trying desperately to play the game and not get kicked. It is clear that Relic learned absolutely nothing about multiplayer performance from DoW2. The problems in that game were essentially the same all the way until 2012, when the game started to truely die, despite the fact that the requirements were the exact same as they where in 2009.\n\nSo there are free weekends. Relic. You do not raise the player population by giving out the game for free. You raise the player population AND KEEP IT by releasing a functional product.\n\nAVOID.\n\nYou can't, though, can you? This type of game is so sickeningly unique that it satisfies only a very refined taste of RTS players in the midst of Call of Dutys (I know that is not how you spell "duties"), Battlefields, and the endless plague of Retro-Indie-whatevers. If you are reading this, you probably decided that you are going to buy this anyway, and you hate yourself for it. I extend my pity to you, reader, if only to save myself from being engulfed in my own despair.\n\nYes, I realize I am still playing it. I like RTS games and the only other alternatives I found are Tiberium Alliances, which is a p2w EA scheme where you join a clan and be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to everyone because your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ commander is on an armchair powertrip, and Starcraft 2, which is focuses too much on spam.","December 24, 2013","false","735.9"," 75 of 119 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","75","119","0","10"

They could've done a lot more when it comes to explaining how the war progressed. As it is, though, the campaign is adequate. Still a very small number of troops to command, unfortunately.\n\nThe addition of the new line of sight system works well, good job on this one. Vaulting over walls is great, until you realize you have to manually command the soldiers to do this, otherwise they'll still go around a knee-high fence like drones. Overall, the gameplay is adequate, but not a great improvement over the first CoH.\n\nGraphics are, again, decent. Nothing to write home about, and they could've included better textures. This is a PC game after all, you have more than 2GB of graphics memory on the graphics cards that are powerful enough to run this game at maximum settings. The sound is overall bland and forgettable, with very few exceptions.\n\nThe multiplayer, however, is by far and away the worst thing about this game. After dozens upon dozens of patches, the developers have yet to balance things properly. DO NOT get drawn into buying DLC commanders in order to be able to field the Tiger I tank, it is by far and away the most useless tank in the game. This doesn't seem like it will change anytime soon, as the last time the developers tried to "fix" the Tiger I, they nerfed it into oblivion.

It feels as if they want the matches to be over in 12 minutes.

A small amount of RNG in strategy games can be good, but it feels like a board game where a dice is rolled EVERY TIME a unit does something. You basically have zero control over the game. If a unit feels like it, he will hit tanks/infantry. If the unit drank too much the night before, he will act like someone who never had proper training. I've played more than 200matches and I still have no idea why cant we have any damage or hp numbers on the Wiki. No specific information is given about what covers do in terms of + and - defense. How much is the penalty for a moving thing to hit another? You have no idea what the f*ck your soldiers can or cant do. Oh and if you think you know what your toddlers are capable of, the RNG was just favorable. I had games were a single conscript squad killed nearly 2 pioneers in close range. and i had games were these conscripts were eaten alive by just 1. AND THE CURCUMSTANCES WERE TOTALLY THE SAME.\nIn an RTS you need to rely on information. In this game, you have nothing. There are also bulletins which increase certain stats but sice you dont know the basic stats, they are worthless.\nAnd the Imbalances thats units have, oh man. Dont get me started on that one.\nBtw I have no idea why did this game ended up like this.\nModders made the Blitzkrieg mod and it was glorious. It still had some rng, but it was just SOME, not the ENTIRE GAME.\nAll it was needed was some god damn matchmaking system, and it would have been good to go.\nNow they are pulling more money with these "new factions" becasue they know their game wont make any on its own because its garbage. This game will never reach the competitive scene, or be something other than a game on a really bad LAN party. They ♥♥♥♥ed up. BAD. And they are still hosting events and other ♥♥♥♥, to cover up the games massive faults.\nWell time to go back to COH1 and other REAL RTS games.\nDont waste your time and money on this guys.

In Summary,  I believe Company of Heroes 1 was superior to this game in every way except for multiplayer custom lobbies (mix and matching armies), and two other very small new features. I like this game and will continue to play it but can't really recommend it as a purchase.\n\nI'm not sure what's happened with Relic but the balance of this game is quite off-putting. (UPDATE: Balance has gotten significantly better since this was written, however regular major patch updates still make balance volitile and unpredictable.) Axis armies are extremely easy to play and have great units. Allies require extreme amounts of micro-management and will generally still lose. Its quite frustrating. I am a veteran RTS player and have never experienced such an imbalance as present in this game. I've tried very hard to become formidable as the US Forces and to a lesser extent, the Russians. However, Axis are simply the dominant armies in the game (particularly, OKW). If the game was a bit more balanced I could really recommend this game. Queueing up for a match will reflect this as 60-80% of players will queue as the Axis (Wehrmacht and OKW).\n\nNor can I recommend this as a competitive RTS title. Competitive RTS players should defer t0o StarCraft 2. But if you are looking for a casual fun title and have an interest in WWII, this game is veru suitable. However, I must beckon you to consider Company of Heroes 1, as it is superior in nearly every way.\n\nThis game as been released with a greedy loot drop system, commander DLC, and campaign/skins/coop mission DLC marketing strategy. Some of the best campaigns, cosmetics, and commanders in the game must be purchased seperately to use. The ones you get for free are good, but you will not be able to play some of the best commanders or campaigns in this game without purchasing additional content. You can unlock them as a free drops but that is extremely unlikely to happen, as they are based off randomness and rarity.\n\nThe armies that were including in the previous Company of Heroes 1 titles are not all included in COH2. You must purchase USA, OKW, and now UKF (The United Kingdom) separately. So It seems clear that they never intended to release a successor (in content and quality) to COH1. That makes this game feel like its just an update to COH1 rather than a true sequel with vision and ambition.\n\nDespite this, there are some welcome new features in COH2. The game is updated with a new engine and higher resolution graphics. There are only three new game mechanics included in COH2: fence vaulting, snowstorms (update: snowstorms are now disabled by default), and true vison. You can research these further but none are really significant upgrades to COH1.\n\nCOH2 is a inferior product in nearly every aspect when compared to Company of Heroes 1. The atmosphere, sound design, and style of COH1 is actually superior to COH2. Yet, Relic has really used this release to nickel and dime their fans. I could elaborate further on this but I feel my review is getting long winded. If you do not believe me, please take a look at the ever growing in-game store and notice how many DLC packages are included for this game. With glaring issues in army design and balance, it seems Relic's current strategy with this game is not to sell a high quality well-made RTS, but rather to sell DLC and segmented content. COH1 with its expansion packs has better balance, the same amount of armies (minus the Soviets unfortunately(although the Eastern Front mod exists for this), a better campaign, better voice acting, better graphic style, better music, and a better Relic.\n\nIn a few years (around 2018) I think this game may be a better deal if you can get a complete edition on heavy discount with all content. I cannot recommend it over COH1 for the reasons I have listed. COH1 has a large selection of community made maps and mods (Europe at War) that really add value to the game. COH2 has excellent workshop content but is not worth the price and fundamentally broken meta of the game.","September 5, 2015","false","171.5"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","25","34","3","5"

German forces are vastly superior to Russian forces in every regard. While this might make the game historically accurate, kind of, it makes for a bad gameplay experience. When two conscript squads totalling twelve men cannot kill half of a four man grenadier squad, all while being more expensive than them, I have issues. Tanks absolutely break the game. German tanks level much faster, and it is nearly impossible to kill a panzer 4 even with two T-70. I keep coming back to this game once and a while as new balance patches are implemented, which may eventually make this game fair and worth it. This game also has a pay to win element to it with DLC payable commanders that add new abilities to you in game. Just type "COH 2" into the search bar on steam and wade through almost 4 FULL PAGES of payable DLC. This is absolutely not acceptable. If balance issues are properly addressed and DLC is made cheaper, I'd pay 99 cents for a new commander but the current price is 4 dollars WTF, this game may be worth 40 dollars.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheesenium/recommended/231430/","cheesenium","Cynical Cheese Cake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheesenium/","466 products in account","Company of Heroes 2 is just a former shadow of its predecessor, Company of Heroes 1. While one could argue that this isnt a remake of CoH1 which is true, however, CoH2 is lacks in content of its predecessor while the game felt dumb downed in so many ways where the Command Tree from CoH1 has been replaced with a system that is similar to Call of Duty's perks system. Rusians felt like a reskinned version of America from the first game in some ways. The campaign is not as fun as the previous game as it felt like the entire campaign is just a lengthy tutorial as the game does not seemed to trust you with its arsenal, unlike its predecessor.\n\nTo make things worse, Sega decided to fill the game with microtrasactions that are pretty costly that ranges from harmless cosmetic skins for vehicles to paid only commander with new units and abilities where you only can obtain it by paying your hard earned money. There isnt any way to unlock these content by playing the game. Unfortunately, this game felt like it is the paid version of Company of Heroes Online with all these microtrasactions. To make things even worse, Sega decides to hide these microtrasactions from the Steam Store while you only can find these microtrsactions inside the game, just like an In-App Purchase (IAP) in a mobile game. The only microtransactions that Sega did correctly were the DLC content packs such as Case Blue where these packs provides some pretty decent new solo and coop missions into the game. One could argue that these content are optional but having these microtrasactions are a notion by major publishers to put more and more paywall into game content to encourage gamers to pay more for lesser content.\n\nAs a conclusion, buyers beware. If you are looking for a multiplayer RTS, look elsewhere. If you are a predominantly single player RTS gamer, Company of Heroes 2 might give you a decent experience. As a Relic game fan, Company of Heroes 2 is a disappointment as this isnt the Company of Heroes sequel that most are looking for but a cynical attempt by Sega to include questionable IAPs into the game that were abused heavily on mobile. I thought Dawn of War 2 was average at best, but seemed like Relic has made Company of Heroes 2 even worse than Dawn of War 2.\n\nI highly recommend one to get Company of Heroes 1 Complete Edition instead, then, get the Eastern Front mod to play as Rusians. Alternatively, get World in Conflict with Soviet Assault expansion or get the latest installment from the Wargame series if you want a more realistic tactical RTS.\n\nEDIT: Here are the links to the in-game DLC store page that can be accessed from the game.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/sale/Company_of_Heroes_2_Vehicle_Camouflages/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/sale/Company_of_Heroes_2_Commanders/","December 21, 2013","false","84.0"," 42 of 66 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","42","66","0","0"

BUYER BEWARE! BUYER BEWARE! BUYER BEWARE!\n\n(DO NOT BE FOOLED INTO BUYING ARMIES SEPERATELY.... BUY GAME IN FULL AND ON SALE!)\n\nI made a moronic decision and spent almost $80 on a game that is constantly on sale for under $10.  They sell the armies seperately for purchase which is kinda a good idea, until you realize that 2 of the factions(Germans and Russians) can not be purchased seperately!  So you could spend $30 on 3 armies, expecting to get other 2 later for around $20....but guess what you have to buy THE ENTIRE GAME to get the other 2 armies.  And the ENTIRE GAME already includes the armies you purchased seperately!\n\nWHY the hell does RELIC trick people into thinkining they can buy this game in pieces?  You can only buy half of it in pieces and when you try to buy the other half you have to buy the entire game which you should have just done in the first place because you would HAVE SAVED $30!  Relic is purposely trying to be deceptive or they are just too damn lazy to release 2 armies seperately!\n\nImagine if Valve released DOTA 2 for $50 and it included 100 characters...now lets say charged $.50 per character.  Now imagine you end up buying 50 characters, then you go to buy your 51rst character and its not available.  Well it turns out that valve only sells half the character seperately and you have to buy the entire game for the rest of the characters!  You buy the game and realize that the game includes all 100 characters!  Valve just tricked you into wasting $25....you spent $75 on a game that is $50.  This is exactly what Relic is doing.\n\nI should have done my research and looked into it or waited for a sale like usual, but its just such a fun game.  I loved the original and many more people play this and it has cooler unlockables.  But in comparison to original this game is kinda trash compared to the original though.  Not really trash, its a good game overall...but it has some major issues.  For one its graphics are nearly identical to company of heroes 1 that came out in 2006...but for some odd reason this game runs about 20x worse on 20x more powerful hardware!  Same resolutions and around the same polygoms, only addition is weather effects and some fire effects.  You can run COH1 on a pentium 4 at 700mhz probably, but you will barely get this to run on a 4 core 4ghz processor from a couple years ago!  You also need a pretty beefy graphics card to run it decently and I would actually suggest 16 GIGS OF RAM!  It runs fine on 8, but after a few matches the game will start to slow down because Relic is too lazy to clear the RAM inbetween matches.\n\nIts a very fun game though.  Its a fun game because it is pretty much identical to the original...it just runs worse and you cant run over people in tanks.  Definately worth a buy at around $10-$20, just please buy the full game!\n\nThis game should actually sell for $10 normally and like $2 on sale.  It is simply just a MOD of the original.  I'd imagine it only cost Relic about $20,000 to make the game....they probably wasted the rest of the budget travelling to Europe to do "research" about WW2.  Playing the single player game....you can tell they didnt research ♥♥♥♥!  They took an American history book from 1958 and a German current events book from 1944...they combined what they learned from the 2 books and this is how they created and depicted the soviet army and their storyline.  It is pretty offensive really....I dont care because I am not Russian.  But if I was Russian I would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥....it pretty much depicts every soviet soldier as a coward or psycopath.  They are literally running away or murdering their own civilians for no reason.  The only heroes they depict in this game are the nazis.\n\nSo...\nStory/single player = 0/10\nGameplay = 10/10\nMultiplayer = 9/10\nOptimization = 0/10\nPrice = .0000000000001/10\nOverall = Good if you dont play single player and buy entire game for under $10.","November 20, 2015","true","342.4"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","19","25","3","3"

(what a surprise, its meant to be; and historically was the better vehicle) This then leads to nerfing and counter nerfing of practically every unit in the game, not to mention the horde of DLC commanders that add content which probably should have been in the game since its release.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/billo007/recommended/231430/","billo007","Billo007","http://steamcommunity.com/id/billo007/","106 products in account","Hard to recommend a sequel to the highest rated metacritic rts of the 21st century, which changes (for the worse) and removes many of the original's features. From a singleplayer aspect, the ai is more intellegent this time round and provides more of a challenge. However the storyline is lacking and doesn't appear intwined very well from mission to mission. The theatre of war game modes add a nice change of pace to the standard gameplay, and lead to some nice co-operative scenarios, perhaps with inspiration from the Joint Operations mod for coh1. Again however, it isnt very well executed with some simply being skirmishes with slightly altered units depending on the timeframe.\n\nMultiplayer matchmaking has also changed. Gone away with the lobby system, with just automatch left; this feels like such a step backwards. Removing of such core features leaves you with a small amount of customisation. You can create custom matches, but you will have to invite other players from steam to fill in the gaps. No longer can you tell whether you are competing with and against equally skilled players, with the new xp orentated level system which grants you xp for simply taking part (also accumulated in single player). No longer are there any statistics such as total online players, number of players searching as axis/soviets, how many are looking for 4v4s, 1v1s etc, leaving you feeling as though there are not many active players (percentages searching for a game jump erratically)\n\nIn game leaderboards are now gone, however have been instated in the Dec10th patch via a weblink. This feels really low effort and looks too much like an afterthought compared to the original coh1 leaderboards. I guess it is a good sign that Relic are listening to its customers as it was a highly requested feature by the community but should have been implemented into the game from release.\n\nGameplay wise, it hasn't been messed about with too much which is a good thing. Weather affects have been added such as blizzards which can cause your units to die from the cold, and mud which severely affects unit speed. The amount of units availiable to each army seems rather small which can limit your countering options and often leads to lack of variety on the battlefield; many players opting to use the same units because many are currently obsolete. Doctrines have been replaced with commanders which share many of the same abilities, meaning that your choice feels less centralised to one strategy; for good or bad. As with many modern games this leads to microtransactions. Commanders, skins and even faceplates are just some of the (rather overpriced) options available on the steam store. Why these are not available already to everyone, or just included in patches is poor and shows the direction in which this game is going.\n\nTo conclude; the main things that this game does well at, were already in place in the original game. Company of Heroes 2 takes away so much and yet adds so little. Adding the soviets as a playable faction in this sequel was nice, but was already done (very) well in the previous game via the Eastern Front mod. If you don't aready own the original (and its expansions) I thoroughly recommend you get that first. However if you've racked up 4digit hours playing the original like me, and you are itching for some more Company of Heroes, I can only suggest you don't pay full price. Honestly, I feel that this game is worth about a tenner, £15 max. Definitely hold out for sales on this.\n\n2/5","January 7, 2014","false","67.3"," 69 of 116 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","69","116","0","1"

THQ went down and game status with it too. no message from the Devs until sega showed up. at that point fans were relived that the game is saved, but they didn't know that it was doomed... after the purchase of sega, the Company of Heroes 2 page on steam was no more and it gave everyone freak.. what happened? with the return of the page, we were all shocked.. all those season pass and other stuff promise was no more and in exchange you would receive bunch of skins and commanders "Extra to the original version". so I paid 100$ for nothing (and sadly there were no  izi refund like these days). when the alpha and beta kicked out, the true nature of game showed itself. commanders that can be purchased through the game and can give you special units or abilities.. this was taken to the alpha forum of CoH but the devs were like "Relax it will be ok and don't worry".. sadly the bugs and OP units was there too (like 120 mortar of soviets could one shot almost everything, even tanks!) but the Relic fixes was in a strange way.. it kept one side more powerful.. for example update 1 soviets was op then update 2 germans were op..\nyou may ask why I told you this story? cause the game is still the same.. expansion ( which are dlcs that add 1-2 army and cant be compared to WH40000) stormed the game beside the skins and commanders.. some units are OP and some of them useless..\ntl;dr Go buy CoH1 and enjoy the glory of the golden age of Relic and THQ..","January 6","false","55.8"," 33 of 51 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","33","51","0","2"

I loved the first 3 CoH games, but this one feels like they gutted it in order to create a lot of extra revenue with DLC. I don't have a problem with publishers trying to generate more revenue by tacking on DLC, but in this case it feels like they built the game, and then the bean counters came through and chopped out large chunks and set them aside for DLC. I suppose if I purchased all of the DLC it would be more enjoyable, but I'm not willing to pay all the extra money for sections of the game that should have been included from the start.\n\nI'm also not fond of the RPG element tacked on via the customization you can do with your Generals. It just doesn't fit very well in this game, in my opinion. I don't like spending a bunch of time browsing through dozens of generals just to gain an extra 2% HMG penetration or crit chance or whatever. I guess maybe it works out well for the PvP crowd but to me it's just a pain in the butt.","November 27, 2014","false","10.1"," 52 of 86 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","52","86","2","2"

The graphics aren't overmuch improved and the extra detail almost makes the game look more muddy and nondescript. Think Battlefield 3 type 'realistic' pallete. This makes reading the screen harder than it was in the first game. For a RTS, being able to quickly observe and analyze the playing field is crucial. I often have to really study the screen a few seconds to figure it completely out. Also, the new engine seems less efficient than the CoH original and despite the relatively minor graphical upgrades the game is much more power hungry. Bring a powerful computer and video card to this firefight. With a AMD Phenom IIX4 and HD6850 l must turn the graphical options almost halfway down to get a solid 30 fps. The game was playable at maxed out settings but I found the frequent frame lag very upsetting.\n\nSome have complained about the new implementation of doctrinal forces. I like them. You have a healthy number of commanders at the start with several unlockable as you progress in your rank. Others may be bought online for a somewhat immodest 4 dollars apiece. I haven't played any online opponents and I've heard complaints about certain DLC commanders being overpowered and upsetting gameplay balance. Just a caution.\n\nEach commander has a handful of doctrinal options that vary between them. Some commanders share doctrinal options with perhaps only a couple differences between them. Some are starkly different. Having the option of choosing the commander at any time adds a nice touch of strategy as you can either get started early on the doctrinal options or hold out until you decipher your opponents strategy before locking in a choice. You are allowed to choose 3 commanders from your deck to carry in-game. This element is nice and makes for some fun fretting and fussing trying to figure out which ones suit your playstyle best.\n\nThe torrential blizzards that will ultimately kill your infantry if not in shelter or around a fire isn't as big an imposition as it sounds and actually adds yet another nice touch of strategy to the mix. Risking the lives of your men in a surprise blizzard assualt is one the enemy probably won't expect as it carries a large gamble on your side to get the drop on them.\n\nIn game physics and sound effects are stellar as ever. You'll feel the boom of explosions and the lumbering sound of tank treads crushing through the forest in high fidelity is a real treat to the experience.\n\nTo cut this short I will still heartily recommend this game since the price has dropped considerably down since release. If you owned and enjoyed the first game you will enjoy this. Just don't expect it to be leaps and bounds better. If not slightly worse for wear.\n\nThumbs up.","January 26, 2014","true","87.4"," 75 of 128 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","75","128","0","0"

Before anything moves it rotates on its axis for a bit to make sure the AI can finish it off. The AI is pretty much god and can see everything on the map resulting in some awesome sniping with AT weapons. Snipers are pretty useless as everything seems to outrange them. Oh and sometimes when you click to perform an order it will simply deselect the unit, usually resulting in it being killed.\n\nI find it impossible to play this wthout raging about how stupid it is, somehow it's just totally unenjoyable on every level. AI on easy is too dumb, but the next level up just cheats to such a degree to make the experience a chore.

The DLCs do exactly what DLCs should - give you some more interesting options to play around with when you've played the living *#$% out of the rest of the game.\n\nAs for the gameplay, multiplayer is quite excellent, primarily because the factions are so interestingly balanced. Germans are by and large easier to play, but once you get to high levels of play, this is no longer an issue. Relic isn't perfect, some unit designs are bad (such as paratroopers), but overall the faction designs are deep and very interesting.\n\nIf you are so short sighted that you can't possibly enjoy anything that's not a carbon copy of CoH1 then nevermind. But CoH2 is groovy game. 8.5/10","March 31, 2015","true","395.6"," 191 of 341 people (56%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","56","191","341","11","10"

Once the novelty wears off you realize the state of the multiplayer might be the worst it has ever been.\n\nBasic functionality remains a mess. Game has been severely unoptimized since original release and post-expansion crashes are more frequent than before. Memory leak problems remain, micro-freezes/lag spikes unfixed (from 2-3 seconds every few minutes to up to 6 seconds now). Main menu capped at 30fps but sinks down to single digits after first game. During gameplay framerates are usually solid, but every now and then performance suddenly dies when loading into a new game.\n\nCompany of Heroes 2 is the UPlay of RTS games. Would you recommend UPlay to anyone ? No, I wouldn't either.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nGrief, misery and frustration are some of the core elements present when dealing with the online experience in Company of Heroes 2. They do come without an additional price tag, unlike so many, many other things in this game.\n\nCoH 2 is a prime example of the DLC craze.\n\nThis is the current breakdown of DLC content for the game:\n\nTheater of War additional mission packs - 20€\nFaceplates (cosmetic)                             - 8€\nVehicle camos (cosmetic)                       - 92€\nDLC Commanders                                   - 59,5€\n\nThat is a base game of 35€ + an additional 179,5€ worth of possible DLC content.\n\nNow of course, cosmetic stuff is a non-issue, but the DLC commanders include several important units, otherwise unavailable in the game (and more commanders are already on the way).\n\nDLC and minor unit design annoyances aside, now a year after release, the game is still plagued with drophacking, sync-errors and constant p2p lag, turning wins into losses and once playful and happy kids into soulless empty vessels, longing for justice.\n\nThe familiar Company of Heroes gameplay experience is there with good sound design, decent visuals and ok maps, though leaving us wanting some great elements from vCoH like night and rain.\n\nI can only recommend this game to the brave and most loyal CoH/RTS fans who can stay hopeful for the future and understand, that skill only gets you half way to victory.","January 29, 2014","false","446.6"," 27 of 41 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","27","41","0","2"

Dan","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971172416/","206 products in account","I have owned this game for a few weeks now, and unless you can buy this at a significant discount ($15 or less), my recommendation is to NOT buy it.\n\nReasons:\n- In addition to the $40 (or $80 for a version that already contains some DLC) for the game, they offer you all kinds of DLC (downloadable content) that should have been part of the game in the first place, and was released on the same day as the game itself. Lots of little extras that add up to more money than you paid for the original game. Some of them are useless and expensive (skins for $3 a pop), some give unfair advantages to players that are willing to pay to win.\n- short, boring campaign that is Russians only. I bet there will be DLC to add a German and other Allied campaigns in the future\n- in games where humans play vs. the computer, RELIC made the computer cheat in order to win. All kinds of treads on different discussion forums point to several ways that the computer cheats to win, making it extremely frustrating to play even in standard difficulty (which is the 2nd easiest of four levels available). Cheating includes advantages in resources, advantages in damage and hits taken by units, ignoring the fog of war, etc. It simply NOT FUN to play against the computer, since it will eventually overwhelm the human players. Every time. Without fail.\n- even though this game got really good reviews from the "professionals" (magazines, review websites), it is overwhelmingly criticized by the actual players who had to pay to be able to play (vs reviewers who get the game for free). Check out the user reviews here: http://www.metacritic.com. Overwhelmingly negative reviews.\n- atrocious pathfinding for your units. You will lose many battles and units because the AI will waste time getting the units where they need to go, or get them stuck somewhere on the way.\n- Game camera is zoomed really far in and cannot be zoomed out far enough to see more of what's going on on the screen. You can zoom in to a very low level of detail though, which is USELESS.\n- Units will wait to be slaughtered instead of turning to fight the enemy. Machine guns and anti tank gun crews will not move their weapon to face the enemy and get annihilated within seconds while you micromanage every unit to do basic things they should do automatically. Given that you cannot see most of your units due to the ridiculous zoom level, they will die before you get a chance to adjust their firing angle.\n\nI could go on, but you can see why this game is not worth $60 PLUS ridiculous amounts of money for DLC, which can easily push you to $100+ for a poorly designed game that offers almost nothing over the brilliant Company of Heroes 1. I own four copies of CoH1 to play on multiple computers with friends. I wish I could return this copy of CoH2 because it's a thoroughly frustrating disappointment on many levels, with regards to content, AI, game code optimization, graphics, etc.\n\nPASS on this one.","January 12, 2014","false","93.5"," 33 of 52 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","33","52","0","0"

To be more specific, Germans had an edge with cheap and OP Panthers and Tigers storming the map easily. As the beta progressed, the severe balance was fixed however since then Germans have always had the upper edge in their versatility and superior units. Balance patches come slow and sometimes don't fix much, and most cause new problems. Along with this, the connection in multiplayer is often immensely unstable, so playing multiplayer is not reccomended, unless you want to play as germany(Which 70-90% of players are always searching as, so it is hard to find a game as them)\n\nSecond of all, the DLC. You will get royally hoodwinked if you buy the DCE, or this game at all. Relic Entertainment promised no pay2win and no game-changing content. They at first kept this promise, and gave the DCE buyers the skins and commanders. However, they soon started releasing overpriced commanders which had custom content, breaking their promise and creating severe pay2win issues more than once. They also did not give the new content to the DCE buyers, ripping them off by giving them useless content(commanders with no new things, skins, and cosmetic things) and then forced them to buy the pay2win content to enjoy the game.\n\nLast of all, singleplayer. Singleplayer has been heavily critcized for it's immense unhistorical way of portarying the soviets; and many players were absolutely livid about this(check the metascore). The campaign tells a terrible story and portrays the soviets as people who kill everyone they meet, including half their own army. The ending doesn't make any sense either.\n\nTo conclude, all aspects of this game are complete rubbish and I fiercely do not reccomend buying this game.","December 14, 2013","false","384.6"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","24","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradewinston/recommended/231430/","comradewinston","ComradeWinston","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradewinston/","302 products in account","Singleplayer Campaign\nThe anti-USSR message shoved in the player's face during the campaign is insufferable. I play video games to be a part of epic battles, glorious tales of heroism and so on. Not to have a game tell me how to look at the world via the cheapest means possible; practically verging on Homefront levels of lazyness in the propaganda department. Except here the narrative is trying to convince you that you are the bad guy and you should feel bad, because the Soviet Union is bad okay, remember communism is bad, and Stalin is satan and... stuff... SOVIET UNION IS EVIL, REMEMBER THAT PERSON PLAYING THIS GAME. RUSSIANS & COMMUNISMS = BAD\n\nGeneral Stuff\nThe units aren't anything more interesting than the original's and it feels like there are a few basic roles missing, as if they couldn't be bothered to add more units. More than half the generals are "premium" aka you need to buy them. Visually it's hardly up to 2010 standards if even, and there is no shortage of Relic DLC whoring to the point of charging for faceplates.\n\nMultiplayer\nPublic custom lobbies aren't even an option, so if you liked playing Annihilation don't plan on ever playing it with anyone but someone on your friends list. After playing a few auto-matches, so far the Germans have won almost every time. Every single one of those times, their victory could be described by the two simple words: Panther & Tiger. And I've played about an equal number of times as either side, no matter what it's always the same thing. At best the USSR dominates from the start and often gets run over by tanks in the end. After six months I expect far better balance in an RTS game, never mind the lack of any multiplayer options beyond 1v1 to 4v4.\n\nIt's also plagued by performance problems, as within almost every match there is someone who is "lagging" and some matches have even frozen at 00:01 seconds into the game. There have been instances where a little message would come up saying I've been lagging and actually kicked me but given that I have a powerful gaming PC and currently a 59Mbps download, 12Mbps upload, and a ping of 11ms; this is clearly a problem on their end. Again, this is inexcusable after half a year.\n\n\nConclusion\nWait until the Deluxe Edition(full version) costs $15 or something, better yet just buy the original Company of Heroes. This game is riddled with performance issues, blatant historical inaccuracies, has a unit/building roster far smaller than the original, and is generally a pitiful excuse for a sequel. If you really want to play as the USSR or have them in CoH in some capacity, there's a mod that adds the Red Army to the original game that can be found HERE.\n\nWhen it comes to the story, they could have easily managed to damn the Soviets without ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on every last person who fought on the eastern front. All they had to do was introduce an element representing the power structure. A single character, a mission or two that doesn't shove a THESE PEOPLE ARE EVIL message in your face constantly that get's the underlying political agenda of the Soviets across. But they didn't bother, they just lazily copied parts of the movie Enemy At The Gates and pasted them into a few missions.\n\nFor those want an explanation of the campaign's lazy anti-USSR propaganda.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m4SCUaBHS8#t=145","January 16, 2014","false","11.9"," 49 of 82 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","49","82","0","11"

The classical example is the half life mod counter strike. So mods count in my eyes. And I feel more happy to donate on game mods then buying DLCs.

Show me Italien forces versus the british or japanese versus british in indonesia or create a hungarian/romanian army, put the finns army into the game to battle the russians.

I was one of the people who pre-ordered the original DCE, and at the time I felt it was a good deal. No longer. They completely shafted the DCE owners, substituting actual extra content in the form of the first 3 ToW packs with worthless skins and commanders. I payed 100 dollars for 12 commanders who bring nothing new, 25 skins of which most are just the same one for heavy, medium, or light vehicls, ONE of the promised 3 ToW DLC, and a faceplate. I have never felt more betrayed by a game company than when I saw how they had changed it. The sheer amount of DLC in this game astounds me, as the base game itself has very little content for a successor to CoH1. I would not recommend this game. It's still fun at times with friends, but nothing can get this bad taste out of my mouth.","December 19, 2013","false","201.8"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","23","35","0","0"

It fails to compliment the original mechanic of how dynamic maps were meant to be, the beginning of your game could involve skirmishes between a maze of hedgerows and villages and end with battling out in smoldering ruins and craters. Steam workshop could redeem this with CoH 1 maps getting fan-made revivals.\n\nThe removal of the commander talent trees is what cripples the game most. No longer are the 3 distinct commander choices  that each serve their own playstyle and tactics but now DLC centered commanders that blend into eachother, the same off-map abilities and additional units rearranged and passed off as a seperate commander.The lack of commander variety will mean each game will start to feel like the last. Every game eventually leads to tanks vs tanks, grenadiers and conscripts end up serving no purpose but to rush enemy tanks, disable them with an anti-tank grenade the go capture a point while your tanks pick off the disabled enemy tank.\n\nTheatre of War scenarios are a joke, they are simply AI skirmish matches. 1941 scenarios let you play with even FEWER units to choose from. Dont expect to see Stonewall or Panzerkrieg game modes from ToV, they'll probably be DLC down the road (hopefully steam workshop will beat them to it).\n\nCompany of Heroes 2 does not live up to its predecessor, fewer units, bland maps, mediocre campaign, and the biggest killer   is how the game is now entirely centered around DLC. I'm sad to see my favourite RTS get strangled by the DLC demon but steam workshop could be its salvation.\n\n\n","January 11, 2014","false","55.1"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","23","35","0","0"

Also, the sum of cost of DLC commanders/skins is another 59.99 USD. I know its quiet common that game industery uses DLC to jerk money off its customer, but everything should have a limit, and I must say SEGA-relic has breached my limit.\n\nMay 12th 2015, adding something up:\n1-The optimization is poor and graphic requirement is ridiculously demanding for what the game demostrates. I can play something like Elder Scroll V with all the mods installed and graphic setting sets to maximum for like 50 or so FPS, but even if I set all setting to minimum in CoH2 I start to lag like hell AFTER the first match, and the only way to fix this ♥♥♥♥ up is to restart the game.

When i was about to invest on them, i tought 'why should I invest on such an unbalanced  game' . C'mon SEGA, you've made very bad choices. You've turned a game with 'overwhelmingly positive' reviews into game with 'mostly positive' reviews. Even DOTA has ' very positive' review and not 'overwhelmingly positive'. I believe that excessive DLCs and P2W features are major culprits.\nWhen i started COH 2, i was in a feeling that i'm very bad at this game. When i realised that one could buy 'OP' commanders and have strategic  advantage, i felt so bad!\nJust imagine, if COH 2 was like COH 1+ balances - P2W -too many DLCs, this can easily beat MOBAs like DOTA or atleast come near to them in ESL. You could in turn make lot of money in that way Just like CS:GO. Moderate price, proper patches, no p2w element will surely take this game to next level. This game has such a potential. After spending 3k hrs on Dota2 (that's not much, i know), i still feel the pleasure in playing coh but not as much as before.\nPlease SAGA, learn your lessons and bring back the glory of COH.

Wait for it to be really cheap, by cheap I mean past the $10.00 count.\n\nIt's sad to see a sequel to a game take a turn for the worse.  With all the advertising going into it's launch, the public discussions from developers about the mechanics and unique game play and art.  All that pales in comparision to the majority of the games main feature: Multiplayer.\n\nThis is the frist time (and hopefully last time) I've ever heard of or seen an RTS game require pay to play in it's multiplayer function.  I have never heard of such a thing.  I expect the P2P from an MMO, that's understandable for server maintenance and other specs.  But to give P2P gamers an advantage over F2P gamers is not only an unfair advantage, it's an insult to both the game and the community.\nI remember when Relic made amazing RTS style titles.  The most memorable for me were Home World, Home World 2, Dawn of War, Dawn of War: Darck Crusade and Warhammer 40,000: Fire Warrior.  As well as the original Company of Heroes 1.\nSo it truly breaks me heart and destroys my faith in a company that would take such an approach to their fans and the community for the multiplayer approach.\n\nAside from the unbalance approach of P2P vs F2P.  The units lack any proper A.I. responses to the heat of battle.  This involves, tank movement away from heavy fighting, moving troops away from grenades before they're thrown and the attack response time for squads when a target is sighted.\n\nThe Campaign itself follows the Russian point of view.  Playing out as a flash back.  I won't give any spoilers, but I was hoping for a bit more time in game play.\n\nNow while the use of a snow and ice environment is a unique and well thought out tactic for the game, such as damaging lakes of ice, areas of belwo Zero to freeze troops and so on.  These fetures don't really make up for the major problems of the game itself.  While I admire Relic's attempt too try a fresh take on the U.I. it feels more complex and difficult to master, especially when in the heat of battle when you feel RUSHED to get something built or try using a squad ability.\n\nAgain I would say DO NOT BUY unless it drops beyond the $10 price range.\nInstead look for the original COH and it's expansions.  Company of Heroes 2, sadly, does not live up to its predecessor.","January 16, 2014","false","19.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The new winter addition and fire mechanic feels like a gimmicky addition that could certainly been added to CoH1.\n\nI dare not speak of the campaign which is meh, but if you are a particular history savant and happen to like Russia, skip the campaign.\n\nI'd give it a 5/10.

Over $100 and that's not counting skins.\n-You want to hear more BS about DLC you need to buy the King Tickle DLC complaint DLC pack.\n-Relic Entertainment bullies people who criticize their game, via deleting comments and banning on their official forums.\n-Also emphasizes all positive comments... Relic? More like Reich Entertainment.\n-Reich Entertainment barely even cares about the game, leaving the game unbalanced and censoring balance complaints until things get bad enough for them to finally fix something in a patch.\n-Slight Axis bias. Yes, for the longest time and even a bit still now the Axis factions (Wehrmacht mainly) have had more utility and stronger units/abilities that give them the upper hand. Calls for balancing were of course censored by the glorious Reich Entertainment.\n-Finally, the game itself is fairly lackluster in entertainment unless you have a group of friends to party up with. Online matchmaking can only last so long for the solo gamer and getting over ranked by the countless prestige 3 level 100s happens more often than not. Frustrating and lackluster sums it up nicely.\n\nConclusion: I've given up on the game other than private matches with friends for fun.

Company of Heroes 2 is not a flawless release, suffering from early balance issues, but undoubtedly deserves the large amount of critical acclaim it has received.\n\nCompany of Heroes 2 releases with 2 factions, the Germans and the Soviets. Fans of the original will be comfortable with the teching paths, veterancy, unit selection, and gameplay mechanics. All of these have been tweaked in one way or another, but all are well crafted, mostly intuitive, and largely balanced.\n\nMost welcome is the contiuance of directional cover and complex damage and accuracy mechanics from the original. Every bullet that leaves a rifle or tank shell that leaves a cannon has a complex series of calculations behind it that influence accuracy, penetration, and damage. A tank shell fired at another tank could miss, miss but still hit something, hit but not penetrate, hit and penetrate, or hit and penetrate with some critical damage. Everything from range, movement, cover, angle of armor, and more is included as variables in these calculations. These complex mechanics make Company of Heroes more than just a game of numbers, but a game of tactical placement of units and appropriate application of firepower that stresses the importance of flanking and misdirection.\n\nIn the end, Company of Heroes 2 is a game that released in solid form and has potential to grow even better in the months and years to come. The solid framework of the original was kept and improved upon, while the developers spent a substantial amount of time making the game beautiful in its violent craft. If Relic can continue making timely and moderately aggressive balance patches, this will be a highlight chapter in the RTS annals for years to come.\n","July 21, 2013","true","431.0"," 63 of 110 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","63","110","0","2"

Units can reinforce if close to a reinforcement point, lil like the wh40k unit system. Besides that unit variety: a lot. Even more with custom mods. Campaign ya well, wish there was also a German campaign but overall it's decent. Additional campaign with Ardennes offence wich is also pretty decent.\n\nGame can crash sometimes when loading the after match report but that doesnt happen too often. If you've played CoH1 then this one will not dissapoint, except maybe for the great ammount of dlc for sale (also mods for that lol).\n\nOnline players are usualy friendly and most of the time u will have an enjoyable match, of course u will also encounter the few unpleasant exceptions to that. Good thing also: theatre of war, custom missions that can be played solo or coop.\n\nOnly downside for me is the loot system wich is pretty much random play for 10 min or play for an hour, win or lose u never know when the loot is going to be coming your way.\n\nDifficulty: easy (real easy) the ai doesnt even move unless you strike first, normal the ai only moves when you capture a point, hard the ai comes for all your base, and fast, expert u need to be faster then the ai with everything because otherwise f*ckin forget about it, u dead. So would say difficulty is well done.\n\nAdvice: vanilla (standard) is maybe  not the best experience but with some custom skins and tuning packs its well worth it.","May 15","true","820.1"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

Yeah sure it was bad how many people died during WWII on the battlefields but why do I have a commander who complains about the methods of the sovjet army when I`m free to send gajillions of conscripts to death without him complaining. So the whole "soldier finds his conciousness seems false but never failed to bore me throughout the whole campaign. The missions themselves were actually pretty god and had variety. And then we have "Theater of War". Instead of giving us DLCs/Expansions with seperate campaigns we get watered downed Multiplayer-Skirmishes and single missions..pretty weak in my opinion.\n4/10\n\nGraphic\nYay the engine is more stable now! While I had to turn off some features in Coh1 because they were too demanding, I can play the game here with better graphics and greater stability. No crashes, no bugs. Very good. It seems atleast some developers actually improve stuff in later installments (Looking at you DICE). Graphic looks gorgous, especially during blizzards etc.\n9/10\n\nGameplay\nFeels unbalanced and arkward, atleast for me. In the few scenarios I played I could almost every time surrender when the Sovjets had KV-1s on the field, cause Paks don`t do ♥♥♥♥ in this game. I don`t think the game is balanced well, but maybe it has to be that way online. It just feels wrong to assault a Pak with a Tank and win.\nAnd why did they removed the DMG values? Now it just says "Effective against BlablaBla" instead of showing me how well it does against certain types of units. It was more of trial and error and the yellow texts could also read "This is tank, it has treads and shoots boom"\n4/10\n\nSo and now a personal note. Why 3 DLCs á almost 20€ + the possibility to pay for skins? For effing mothertrucking skins which are 2€ each. It is not as outrageous as other games but still. This is wrong\nPlus the bulletin stuff you unlock by playing the game. So player who play the game for longer have an advantage over others, even if it is not significant but still. This is not okay\n\nFinal verdict.\n5/10\n\nBeside the graphics and some nice campaign moments it had nothing really to offer for me (Not interested in online, and it seems the focus was on that this time)\nWas nice to try out for a weekend, but nothing I would pay for. In my book the first one is better","January 18, 2014","false","29.6"," 29 of 47 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","29","47","0","1"

The reason is that it's not as good as it's predecessor Company of Heroes.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, it's fun, it can get anger inducingly annoying but that's mostly due to human error. The maps are great, but not as great or as memorable as the Company of Heroes maps. I can name a dozen maps from CoH off the top of my head easily but when it comes to CoH2 I start to struggle. They're pretty generic and I feel it's because Relic couldn't just remake the old maps again and attempted to make new maps which were more generic and more samey than the CoH maps. The snow really grinds my gears, I avoid snow maps as I would the bubonic plague or mosquitos. They're anti fun and really dampen the mood during an intense game. The tanks however are improved I feel. The sides you can choose feel more balanced too. The new commander addition to the game isn't as good as the doctrine/company choice of the last game. They are all too similar whereas in the last game there were real differences such as the stark comparison between Airbone company and Ranger company. Each of those had their own strength and weakness and counter picking was a lot more important then. The online lobby is improved however I do miss one feature, the feature to tick up.\n\nOverall, Company of Heroes 2 on its own is a good game and would be worth a purchase. However since CoH is cheaper and superior I can't reccomend it over that, and thus I've decided to not reccomend this game.","January 1, 2014","false","185.9"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

Brilliant, I thought, I can try for CoH2 for free. Oddly I was reminded of the days of old when we would buy a PC magazine with a CD attached, we  could go home and install it, play the game demo, and away you go you would either want more or you would leave it. Anyway, I digress.\n\nI downloaded the game etc etc. Clicked start and was immediately struck by the superficiality and lack of real depth. We are hit with a simple cinematic (perhaps this is a stripped Steam version I may need correction here) and bang we are in, no real atmosphere or scene was set in contrast to the quasi story personalised as in the original CoH. To immerse yourself fully you have to have some prior knowledge of this conflict to really appreciate the fundamental change in tactic that goes hand in hand that is required by the player to understand this expansion. In sum sacrifice is the mode of the day.  As another reviewer aptly summarises; the days of CoH allowing for an individual approach to gameplay such as defend, or inch by inch ground gains are gone in this release, hence the flavour of individual gameplay so loved in the original is overbearingly crushed by the mechanics of this expansion. Whilst trying to capture the spirit of expendability synonymous with the military approach of the time, little consideration was (supposedly) given to impact this may have on gameplay when transposing this approach to a RTS platform.\n\nHowever, at $16.99 on steam free play weekend you would think it would be a steal, considering the relative time between its release and now right? Wrong, very wrong. Please do not get caught by this as it is as close to a legal scam as you will get. Yes, I mean DLC, and there is lots of it.\n\nI'm sorry, even at the budget price of $17 there is no way I am touching this game, even with the deep affection I have for the first one. I really feel Sega and Relic are hoping to cash in on an emotional attachment that many of us have for the first game. One reviewer mentioned a bait and switch scam, which I have to agree with as that is what I might feel caught by if I buy into this DLC horror.\n","January 17, 2014","false","3.0"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

How are we supposed to enjoy beautifully built custom modifications like blitzkrieg or eastern front, when the developers work actively to prohibit such developments?\n-DLCS: too many of them, with mostly no more content than a camo pattern or a commander. Those things are supposed to be in the game already, how can you possibly ask for more money?\n-Maps are too small.\n-Population cap is 100 only (unless it is on one of the workshop maps, if it is set in the map)\nYou want large fights, with multiple machine gun squads, assault troops, pioneers, field artillery and whole tank platoons simultaneously? not in this game.\n-Diversity of Units: Panzer IV, Tiger. maybe a stug III. thats all you get when playing germans. with blitzkrieg there's different versions of the Panzer IV, Marders, Hetzers, Jagdpanzers, light Tanks like the Hotchkiss.\n-Zoom: Like to zoom out to get a good overview over the battlefield? Not in this game\n-Command trees / Skill trees: You like having the decision on what to get next to have the right thing for your next encounter. Well, heres the thing. The skill trees of CoH2 are just trunks - no branches. you get 5 or 6 abilities and/or units and thats it. and you get it in the order the developers intended to. You only decide which commander to choose. Do I need to cite Blitzkrieg mod again?\n-Deadlyness of weapons: Can you imagine a machine gun shooting at a group of infantry right in front of it, in the open, and not killing any of them for 10 minutes? Hell, this game helps you out. You dont even have to imagine it, its right there. When you want to kill infantry´, use mortars or flame throwers.

I love CoH more than any RTS. My entire problem is with the way they have turned CoH2 into a huge micro transaction pay to win game where the more you play the better your troops/guns/vehicles are.\n\nSo if you buy the base game you get several commanders. I can't remember specifics but the original armies from the first release gave you more options than the Western Front Armies. More commands. Six commanders for the Soviets because I bought the digital deluxe version and got ♥♥♥♥♥. Don't get me started on what I got for my extra $40. Six extra commanders and some vehicle textures, oh joy!\n\nAnyway, it has been a long time since the beta testing and since I started playing retail. More on that a bit later. If I am not mistaken there will be three to six starter commanders for the Soviets (three of those are from the deluxe version I think), the German Wehrmacht came with three to six (again three extra from the Deluxe Edition I think), the Western Front Armies add-on came with three each for US Forces and the German Oberkommando West. I've logged one hundred hours of nothing but skirmish and online multiplayer. Though I tend to play skirmish mode mostly. At the end of the game you get random drops. Since purchase I have got ten Soviet commanders to drop. Nine Wehrmacht commanders. And one (yes, just one) US Forces commander to drop even though I have played mainly the US forces since the release of Western Front Armies.\n\nThe problem? When we beta tested you got to picked the commander and their combat options or perks so to speak. With the retail release you don't have that option and even though the two base armies have lots of commanders and intel bulletins that randomly drop at end game the commanders are too similar in my opinion. And the Intel Bulletins are basically improvements to your existing options. So the more you play the better your sqauds/guns/tanks are.\n\nThe add-on of the Western Forces gave very little. Random drops are almost non existant because they only have several extra commanders and they are trying to get you to buy them for $3.99 each. And there in lies the problem. Since Western Front Armies went live I have scored one commander and it was a cruel joke. His first perk is a WC51 Military Truck w/ .50 cal HMG mounted on the back that can't even pin down a squad of engineers. Not to mention they (any squad even engineers) can take it out so fast it is completely worthless on the battlefield. Does that sound balanced? Oh, but if I buy the other commanders they have much better options you say? No, thanks.\n\nI recommend buying the entire game if you can get it on the cheap. I regret paying one hundred US dollars for the so called deluxe version. I have bought the Western Front Armies and the British Forces but grudgingly.

Not only does that mod have more units but plays as you would expect.  COH2 feels like a stripped down version of COH1 with game play mechanics that don't add any enjoyment.  The addition of paid skins and microtransactions makes it feel like a free-to-play game.  Also ran into my fare share of bugs on Win7 64bit.  While the graphics are nice, it is difficult to see units and tell what is going on at times.  Disappointed and recommend a pass.","January 18, 2014","false","58.5"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

I do have over 200 hours into the game which shows that its got at least some appeal to it, but my overall experiance has left me swearing more often then not, and i have to acknowledge that the game really is a waste of time overall.\n\nUnit response is so sluggish your units die unneccessarily (and seemingly wait until death is assured), units can magically go into 'miss mode' where you can have 5 tanks shooting at one that is at 5% health that doesnt die no matter how many shots are fired, or unit pathing that really seems to be doing its level best to get your units killed and goes anywhere but where you want, seems to go straight at the enemies needlessly, and exposes units backsides for no reason at all.  Tanks far too frequently need to stop completely and then completele their turns which has a tendency to get them killed.\n\nedit: and with the new tank pathing its even worse, and this is honestly the most unresponsive rts (and maybe game of any kind) in history.  It simply doesnt take commands at certain points or does the worst thing it possibly could when it FINALLY does (like deciding to go in reverse everywhere, which was supposed to be the point of the fix, but they made it even worse somehow).  I wish i was exaggeratting but coh is simply record breaking in how bad units respond or their pathing.  It really unbelievable in scale.\n\nThen there are only 2 factions, and those 2 factions are not balanced very well, and even if they were there are too many one shot kill weapons or things that can destroy your army in a single click which in my opinion goes against everything rts stands for as the enemy cant dodge this attack (see the aforementioned unit response sluggishness) and has no real defense against it except using cheese back on the enemy in turn.\n\nPlayer stats and much statistics are limited to missing altogether, and they keep removing more information about other players with every patch.  Also this game is THE camping/turtling rts, which is widely regarded as the realm for noobs anyways.\n\nOverall if your desperate for rts in this day and age and HAVE to have your fix and you can find this one sale for $5 then go for it, but overall its a pos and a monument to the failure of the modern video game industry.  Heck even coh 1 seemed like it had more going for it then this game, and you can find mods for it still and people to play against.\n\nOh and last but not least (altho not limited to, there are certainly other things to gripe about in this game) this is a borderline pay to win game.  If you dont have the pay commanders, prepare yourself to always be at a MAJOR disadvantage.\n\nReally wish this wasnt the only real rts alternative today, and its a bit of a metaphor that relic went under after making it.  Honestly the more i play the i wonder why i havent uninstalled it yet, but a few  weeks later i will be missing standard rts.","March 15, 2014","false","418.9"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

But, being a big fan of Relic Games, and being playing them since i was teen, kind of means i know what they have done in there past success's. That said, I've managed to rack up over 6000 hours on COH, sadly this was even before steam took part with COH, so my steam account doesnt show this information, but since having steam it shows currently only 1600 hours. But anyway, as for COH2. I've only put in 600 hours, and this includes the time in BETA, as i have the Collectors edition, also when it was on the pre order stuff, i managed toget 10 others players to aquire the game, to help THQ threw what ever the mess it was in, All this said. After COH2 arrived on release, it was nice game. but always missing something.  Slowly after each patch the game has been getting more OUT of BALANCE, and even so bad that you can only now obtain no more than 5 tanks in your army. They current publishers are really nerfing the game so its unplayable. So much so, that i stopped playing it, And after hearing about the new Expansion, i got to thinking i should give them another try, Well here i am writing this review, and in even more disgust, i assure SEGA/RELIC. that you can definatly count me out, and i will NOT be recommending this GAME to Anyone.  I even think its made COH seems sad to play now.  If you  do want to buy this game. the only thing i can say thats nice, is if you didnt have the past versions. you might manage to make this fun, and maybe you will get 200 hours out of it before uninstalling.

Company of Heroes 2 has changed allot since its early days and is better game if it´s compared when how the game was back in 2013, which allot of people seem to cry about.\n\nThe game itself got some of the base building stuff and teaching, though the game focuses more on the battlefield rather than the base building moment of the game. Another thing that company of heroes 2 got that other RTS games don´t have is the RNG element of the game and it´s destructible battlefields that give a nice element to the game.\n\nRNG means random generated number, what it does have to do with the game is to give this risk/reward feeling while you send your units into battle. When your units shoot their guns, the game will select a random number, depending if the number was good or not will determine if the unit made a hit or not. Sometimes a tank shell can destroy a whole squad because of that, and can be very frustrating, but also when you manage to do this against the enemy, it feels rewarding. Though some people might hate this RNG system that relic has added to Company of Heroes 2 as a feature, cause of the frustration it can give while you're trying to finish that last squad or tank and your units miss all there shots to finish the job.\n\nThe DLC side and balance, +features:\n\nCompany of Heroes 2 got allot of DLC that's mostly just skins or commanders that give you a different playstyle, though nowadays relic has fixed the major issues the game had back in 2013 when some commanders were just pay to win, you needed to own these commanders to play decent against others players and the game has become much more stable since then. Relic has also added a "War spoil" system that enables all players that have purchased the game to get the DLC(expect Theater of war and new factions) while playing the game. Though, this system is very close to the drop system in tf2 and is very random. The only really garante for you to get all the DLCs for free is just to play allot over the time and hope you get the DLC you wanted for free. They haven't added any kind of a crafting system with the duplicates you sometimes to get while getting war spoils which mostly leads you to remove them because of the item limit with 1000 slots. They haven't added any trading system for players to trade items with each other which is a bit sad, though it seems like relic is hinting on adding these features with how they drastically changed their business model.\n\nFeatures it lacks:\n\nThough, the games got some unpolished features like: how the game lacks an ingame leaderboard to show players what´s there rank and relies more on you using a browser to check your rank from there website which is annoying. The game is also pretty badly optimized and really needs to be worked on. Even the main menu got problems with giving a very unpolished feeling, while starting the game up the screen will lock itself to 30fps cause of the movie that is played behind the main menu.\nAnother issues is that some animations with the new factions are very clunky and gives a very unpolished feature to the game while playing also, I´m talking about the infantry units animations in the game.\nThe game doesn't have a option to change your hotkeys which is a bit sad and gives you only the option to change between Classic Hotkeys(hotkeys from coh1) or grid hotkeys.\n\nThe ranking system:\n\nThe ranking system in coh2 is also very unbalanced and will sometimes match you up with a completely new player against players that have 800h+ ingame. Another thing is that they almost never reset the ranks. That means if some player managed to become maybe top 200 or so, it enables him to stay at the rank pretty much with just not playing. It´s a bit shame they haven't really inputted a same kind of a feature that Cs:go got with it´s "accept to play" feature. What I mean is that, when you search for a game and accept, you comply that you are gonna play a game for 30-60 mins, and if you leave, you're gonna get a punishment for breaking the "accept to play feature". This enables players to leave right when a match starts and ruin the fun for other players in 4v4 (for as an example), and make them lose right of the bat and decrease their rank thanks to him/her.\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nI would recommend this game for people that want something else than Starcraft 2 in the RTS genre and want something new with its own elements. It´s a bit sad that Company of Heroes 2 isn´t really that big in the competitive genre of games, and the game has the ability to be there, though there are some things that need to be changed before it can see that light of day.","June 23, 2014","true","491.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","10","12","4","7"

HumanWaveSlaughterKill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/S24parten/","58 products in account","Absolutely not, after playing the game for 300 plus hours the game is extremely repetitive. Sega/Relic even have the audacity to remove the highly favored custom lobby, which would allow players to select games to play with random people online at their own leisure, now the only thing left to choose from is the pathetic automatch.  It can easily be said that matchmaking is worthless along with being unbalanced, with your team either being a group of moronic third graders or your enemies being "s00per l33t MLG noscope' pro's" capable of wiping you out extremely quickly.\n\nLooking for a long battle? Not here, not with the lovely VP game, in all my hours of gameplay my longest game of VP (including 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4) was only a solid 35-40 minutes.\n\nNote: Expect an enemy to build something logical? Nope, they'll just spam cheap OP tanks with their purchased OP commander.  Playing as russian? Congratulations, you just won! Oh, unless you're playing against the Elite German Doctrine, which is also purchasable, who can insta rank his units up for a pitiful amount of fuel and bring in the unbeatable Tiger Ace mid-late game.\n\nIf you're looking at Company of Heroes 2 for rich unit diversity and capable counters, along with nice maps, look further, like, way further, because this game isnt for you.  In Coh2 artillery isnt even that important of an influence anymore, maybe besides the much spammed 120mm mortar by the soviets. Also it should be noted there arent bridges anymore, atleast not bridge maps which if all or most are destroyed will effectively cut off your enemies from striking you.\n\nAll in all I do -NOT- reccomend this game, it's a sad attempt to rake in the money with their over powered or worthless doctrines/commander DLC's.

Was looking forward to it so much, I pre-ordered it. All the things Relic showed in trailers - weather, True-sight, cold-tec etc. looked quite nice and promising.\nAll the hype and hopes ended when Open beta started - it turned from Huge Hppe to Terrible disappointment very quickly - only two factions, mediocre graphics (it looks almost like CoH: ToV, but requires much much more from your PC) , dull maps (no cities, almost no bridges - looks like CoH 2 is afraid to be fun, not just regular e-sport-like strategy game)...\nIt turned even worse when game was released - never ending DLC packs, commanders, only doctrinal new units (you must buy commanders to get them). At first soviets were inefficient soldier hordes (just like history books tell us - thousands of "Oorah" and "Pabiedaaaah"  shouting men, poorly trained and even worse equipped ---not talking about elite troops from Syberia, or any other "superior" class - only regular "footmen"- conscripts) but with more and more patches they became totally equal to Ostheer - those "potato farmers" fight almost as good as highly trained and disciplined reich soldiers now. Probably because forums are full of that "German OP - RELIC ARE NAZI, RUSSIAN TROOPS SHOULD BE IMMORTAL AND EQUIPPED WITH TANK CANNONS BECAUSE MY SOVIET HISTORY BOOK TOLD ME SO *DUUURRR*" crap.\nIMO. all they needed to do to balance it - make russian infantry  even cheaper and weaker, buff up T-34 A LOT and make german troops more expensive. This way factions would at least be different, now they are quite similar.\nIn conclusion, this game is a little boring if compared with CoH: ToV. It lacks diversity, fun maps, interesting factions. If you consider buying it - don't waste your time - go grab the first one and install a mod if you got bored of it. If you still want it - I can't blame you, so go nuts.

Balance itself seems to swing wildly between patches, units exclusive to DLC, and the whims of the developers.\n\nThe UI is a number of steps backwards and in the wrong direction.  The UI designer himself was stubborn and refused to acknowledge the many, many problems associated with what he put out.  As a result, the final game suffers terribly.  The game was released with a number of basic functions not ready - an insult in and of itself, but because of the passion I had for the original Company of Heroes, and the unfortunate circumstances surrounding THQ, I was able to deal with it.  The UI eventually became, in my opinion, a whole new monster, as incremental updates were released and base features were more or less 'tacked on'.  The end result is an ugly, unintuitive mess that neither works or pleases.\n\nTheir community manager has mentioned that there have been near twenty updates as of this writing.  Their effort is commendable, but I do not see much in the way of actual improvement.  It looks to me as a series of lateral movements intended to improve, but in reality, the game is far to embroiled in poor design choices.  There are far too many variables to balance, too many nuances to control, and again, too many random occurences to feel like your personal skill was the main factor in victory.\n\nBy far the worst tragedy of this game is that the original went under and isn't getting the attention and care it deserves.\n\nReview Update :\n\n400 hours of game play later.  Also two years later. There are now leader boards.\n\nGame was resembling something playable in August 2015.  This was more or less destroyed once the Brits were released in September.  The way that Relic abuses their player base is somewhat troubling.  A series of heavy nerfs followed the British faction over the next few months.  Relic slowly turned down the heat here and there but balance has truly suffered.\n\nGame build is shaky.  Heavy memory leak performance loss after a handful of matches.  Latest patch (February 25th 2016) broke veterancy.  Not entirely sure what the direction of everything is.  We were told that an American unit (the Calliope) was having it's shots reduced from 24 to 18 because it was over performing, yet a unit was released simultaneously that can fire 30.  For five dollars.\n\nIf you can stomach the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that this company shovels out, the game is still fun.  As a balanced, competitive game, I can't say that it is.","February 14, 2014","false","870.5"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","22","35","0","0"

There are few things that CoH2 introduces that do make it feels like improvement, but overall it feels like its more of a one step forward, two steps backwards syndrome.\n\nIf there's one thing Relic(pre/during development) or Sega( this isnt the 1st rts that they screwed up) needs to learn and know, for the love of god, please let there be dedicated server for online matches. There's a reason(though not the main one) why most of relic games arent really relished by the online community, its the p2p system for matches, which makes the matches are ridiculously annoying and unfun to play with.\n\nComparing to its predecessor, games are surprisingly short. Probably too short. I think Relic may dabble too much into DoW2 series and forgot CoH mechanics when making CoH2. It lost the 'strategic feeling' of CoH, but doesnt really capture the 'tactical feeling' of DoW2. So what you get here is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love child of both.\n\nThe snow/blizzard system....its a gimmick. Is it good? Eh,... cant really say. I think Relic originally designed it to be a huge part of the campaign, it sure does wonder in the campaign. It does feel like winter in russia, which is freezing cold, chilling to the bone. But as a rts mechanic, I'd rather they do a working weather system, for all weather for multiplayer purposes.\n\nIf you are getting this game, you better have a good connection if you want to play online, or pray that your opponent does. If not, stick to AI matches, or play with friends. The campaign and other features are okey, but I'd rather play the predecessor.","February 12, 2014","false","23.5"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

You don't. Every single match I've played, the Germans have been able to outnumber me, even despite initial territory gains. They also get tanks before me because their huge doommobs of infantry and MGs are able to take every single point on the map, depriving me of fuel. And I wasn't charging across fields, either - I have had German grenadiers kill two squads of conscript infantry in heavy cover with every advantage available to them. This game just doesn't make any sense.\n\nIn fact, I tested this - I went and played a match versus a Standard AI, cranked out nothing but conscripts, captured every single bit of territory I could, and the Germans still had more men than I did in the early game and chewed me up and spat me out, given their units were more numerous and just plain better in every way.\n\nI don't know what this game is smoking. Germans better than Russians at mass attacks? T-34s that cannot go head to head with the Panzer 4, not even slightly? What in Marx's name were they thinking?\n\nTL;DR: The side balancing for this game is lopsided, makes no sense, and makes the entire game thoroughly and entirely unenjoyable compared to the first one.

It's simply wrong on many levels due to many facts and evidence which states otherwise. Forget the "need" of flanking and pinning when your enemy can simply spam a huge amount of MG's and Anti-Tank guns in less than 10 minutes. And watch as an extremely cheap tactics and spams by the enemy causes a slew of insults from your "teammates", each saying that the other is OP.\n\nAlso, money-grabbing DLC nonsense which range from Commanders who have access to unique and sometimes absurdly powerful/situational units like the Soviet IS tanks or Assault Grenadiers which cost USD $4 PER COMMANDER (Yes, not a bundle) to useless and sometimes neglible War Spoils system to the stupidly placed Intelligence Bulletin, Faceplate and army skins which all seems like a desperate attempt to make it look unique.

Yes even with a negative rating I will say that. Its really is fun to play but its gets a negative from me because of this trend of cash grabbing from game companies these days and I refuse to support it. If you bought all the expansions and main game brand new, thats over a 100 bucks for something that shouldve been 60 all together. Thats not including the new generals they make you pay for or wait 1000 hours of gameplay to unlock. These generals are wayyy better than the stock ones you are given and make online play uninviting. I will not play this game anymore until they get the reward/spoil system reworked.\n\nBuying this game in a bundle with dlc on sale is a good way to get into it but keep in mind, you might unlock a new general in your first few games.... or play 150 hours like me and only unlock tank skins.","April 22","false","147.8"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","24","39","2","1"

(i.g. producing tanks in seconds, making it possible to spamm your enemy with tanks -> very easy tactic to win the game in early stage)\n\nThe variety of "pay extra" parts make this game absolutely unenjoyable to me. While i got the game pretty early at which not so many addons were available i still got annoyed by the paywalls.\n\nThe new engine used for CoH 2 is imho worse than the original one and takes away a part of the feeling related with the series. The hp, aiming and pathfinding system is bad (applies only to you, not to AI) making the game feel sluggish and unfair when playing against AI opponents.\n\nOverall - not recommended. If you are looking for an arcadish 2nd World War Strategy Game, either go for Company of Heroes 1 (plus addons) or try out the a little bit more demanding Men of War series.\n\n5/10","September 25, 2015","false","20.4"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

So, the fact I don't even have an option to do that, unless I make a friends only custom match just upsets me even more...\n\nIt's a shame really, because I enjoyed the first game, I also loved the way the British played differently to the other factions.  It completely fitted the way I played the game, with movable bases to help push forward where ever it was safe.  That's all gone, no way whatsoever of playing like that...\n\nAlso, the really good wave defence co-op mode from the first isn't here, which, if they had that, I would probably recommend this game, because I love to defend rather than go offensive.\n\nIt's a shame really, the game looked so promising, and Relic just failed to deliver what I, and probably quite a few of the playerbase wanted.\n\nJust to clarify, if you're into the PvP part of the game, I can't comment on that, it's not really the part of the game I enjoy, I'm basing this being a casual RTS'er, who wants to waste a bit of time fighting a challenging AI, than to struggle and get frustrated everytime he plays.","February 17, 2014","false","6.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Obviously not an improvment on the original. Even simple comments like retreating a squad leaves them standing there as you click the retreat button and you watch the squad just stand there and get killed. Tank battles are impossible.

I had all three flags at one point with 500 points and the enemy had no more than 3 sectors, but had enough resources to tank rush my base with 10-12 tanks, and legions of troops.

The first game was such a classic. I felt it really revolutionized the genre of RTS, allowing for a unique gameplay. I'm not much for rushing/spamming strategies, so the original COH was a challenge, in that I was always pushing for resources, not allowing me to remain in my comfortable "turtle" style of gameplay. It never felt overwhelming, or too hurried, but rather just generally rushed, like a pitched battle would.\n\nThe second edition has not changed all that much from that recipe. There are some neat whiz-bang things like cold, and ice, and the ability to jump obstacles. However, these do little to add to the authenticity of the game. Instead, they just clutter up your decision-making with additional selections to be made each time you want to move a unit. Now, rather than selecting a squad and advancing to a location, I find myself micromanaging each squad. Sprinting from fire to fire to keep warm, or ensuring that they assault over walls rather than going over them keeps me from focusing on the big picture. Trying to manage three separate forces in a winter map? Good luck. You'll be hard pressed to track a few units, let alone forces spread across a map when a snowstorm blows in.\n\nAs far as balance is concerned, Soviet conscript doctrine seems to be vastly overpowered. The ability to produce nearly 3 units in the timeframe makes playing as the Soviets far too easy and against them far too difficult, on any setting. The Germans cannot keep up with the Soviet onslaught, and as a result are very dissatisfying to play. Perhaps this is true to life, but it certainly makes for an unappealing faction in this game.\n\nThe Command Loadout function is probably intended to help with this... but I've not been able to understand it. I cannot determine what I'm changing, what the changes are affecting, and how they will assist my game. There seem to be far too many options, many of which appear to be cosmetic (do I really need to pick from 5 different camouflage patterns, none of which do anything to help conceal my equipment and Soldiers?) and of little value.\n\nThe graphics appear to be exactly the same as the original COH, though what can you honestly do with tiny little figures? I won't fault the maker for that.\n\nOverall, I'm under the impression that Relic took a great game that was becoming a bit stale, slapped a new face/ generals on it, cluttered the UI, made it more difficult to control the battlefield, and ensured that anyone just coming into the Series will be thoroughly confused.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Swiftsabre/recommended/231430/","Swiftsabre","Commander Swiftsabre I","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Swiftsabre/","51 products in account","Company of Heroes 2 is the successor to the RTS Company of Hereos, and whilst I have played very little of that game and cannot judge which is better, I can still see the glaring differences. Company of Heroes 2 is not an RTS in the general sense; It has little base building, no worker management and a reliance on strategic points to gain resources. This system has turned many a person away from CoH 2 and Dawn of War II, Relic's other less RTS-like RTS, but are these things so bad? I'll discuss the pros and cons of CoH 2 and how well it draws it's mechanics from it's predecessors (CoH 1, DoW II and  DoW I).\n\nI write this review targetting those who have already taken an interest in the game and are yet to decide whether to buy it, consider this piece as a more in depth description from an aspiring, competant 1v1 player.\n\nThe pros:- Company of Heroes 2 has good graphics: This is the least important feature of the game, it could look much worse and still be playable, but it's these graphics that immerse the player and let them believe they are in WW2.\n\n- The game has improved mechanics: Ever been annoyed when your Predator tank turns around when trying to escape on 100hp and gets shot in rear armour? Well luckily Relic improved this from DoW II and added a reverse function to vehicles, allowing them to reverse over long distances instead of short, frantically mircroed distances. Another example is climable cover, meaning cover can be long and winding, with units able to move across it without taking ridiculous paths. Showing enemy setup arcs, very small but very good for planning an assault with.\n\n- The range of units: Every faction has access to many units bought from base, ranging from mortar teams to riflemen squads to assault rifle armed Panzergrenadiers. This makes for the possibility of a wide variety of units employable right from base. But this is further augmented through the commander system, allowing for otherwise unavailable units to be deployed: Light AT Guards Rifle Infantry, Airdropping Paratroopers and fearsome Tiger tanks. The unit variety is excellent and makes for fun and fresh plays after many games.\n\n- The commanders: Evolved from DoW II's hero selection system and CoH 1's doctrinal tech trees, CoH 2 changes this dynamic to make it more flexible on the battlefield. Able to pick from three commanders during a game allows for situations to unfold before deciding the best tactical move. Do you want one that swarms them with infantry? One that buffs your infantry and provides artillery support? Are you churning out vehicles and looking for commanders who can repair/send out the big tanks? Although it doesn't have the two path trees of COH 1, it offers more variety between games with extra doctrines that can be mixed and matched.\n\n- Connection: The game allows users to reconnect to games if disconnected for whatever reason. This problem has plagued DoW II due to random drops and Steam disconnects which makes it a very useful feature.\n\nMicro: This is not SC II and it's 300 actions per minute, you can sit back and evaluate your strategy, which makes it more tactical with less emphasis on micro and more in-depth combat.\n\nThe cons:- Optimisation: The term "Relic lag" has not evolved within the playerbase for no reason. The game occasionally lags for varying lengths of time for no apparent reason, it happens in base, it happens when your oppenent launches an assault, it happens just at the critical point when you might lose a vehicle but haven't moved it yet. Relic lag gets everyone, no matter how many supercomputers are running this game Relic lag will always persist.\n\n- Spam: I mentioned unit variety, well yes, unit variety exists, but functional unit variety does not. The same unit will be spammed all game because the meta and balance decree it so. Low level to medium level Soviet players will spam Maxims and Zis guns and simply camp the victory points, waiting for games to end whilst they sit and watch. They may also spam T34 tanks because they're cheap. Ober Kommando West players will 99% of the time use the dreaded "Schreck blob" technique, building four or five Volksgrenadier squads and outfitting them with Panzerschrecks. They level up so quickly and become so powerful nothing is safe from their attack move blobbing. Spam has been looked at in recent patches and tactics for facing it have become more viable, e.g. suppressing Light Infantry Howitzers and better overall Heavy Machine Gun AOE suppression.\n\n- Community: This is not the fault of Relic, and at least they put profanity filters in game to make insults seem farcical, but many players are silent tryhards or raging players who blame you for their lack of skill. The times when you meet talkative players are ones to be relished.\n\n- Commander meta: There are a fair few commanders for Ostheer (Wehrmacht in game) and Soviets, and whilst variety is nice to playa round with, there are definite strong and weak ones. Mechanised Assault/Elite Troops/Close Air Support for Ostheer, Fortifications for OKW, Rifle Company/Airborne for USF and Shock Rifle/Guard Motor for Soviets. These doctrines get abused for their huge early game pressure and late game dominance that doesn't offer any opponent room for manouver. Not to mention you can buy these commanders instead of having to wait to get them dropped. As of recent updates these commanders have been changed so they rely less on call in units that are more powerful than stock, meaning base units are more desirable and gameplay has been directed to make sure players get rewarded for teching to higher tiers without waiting for call in armour.\n\n- RNG: The Panzer fires it's last shot at the escaping T34, hoping to clear it up and win the day. But no, the shot bounces off front armour and your Panzer gets immobilised on a mine, and then at the critical moment when it dies, the crew decide to hop out and leave it abandoned for the enemy to take. The RNG is a massive feature, stray shells, tank accuracy, model kills. It makes for punishing plays that you don't deserve but the RNG gods like to inflict upon you. This is not skill, this is stupidity.\n\n- Irritating new mechanics: Certain units can spawn from any building on the map, vehicles can crush infantry and Soviet tanks can cap. Nuff said.\n\n- DLC: There is so much DLC, commanders, skins, missions, campaigns etc. This allows for Pay to win scenarios in multiplayer as well as huge money sinks like Ardennes Assault.\n\nIn conclusion:Company of Heroes is fun but occasionally frustrating RTS/RTT with well fleshed out mechanics and interesting design descisions, just with poor execution. The game was in a fairly unbalanced state whilst Relic pushed more and more DLC out to the masses, allowing for pay to win and money grabbing methods, but gearing up to the Britsh Forces expansion the balance has been getting much better and Relic listen to the community when it comes to progressively balancing the multiplater experience. The game is fun, but the enjoyment can be spoiled by some poor map design (Bystraya Voda/Stalingrad), iffy (but much improved as of late) balance and cheap tactics with pay to win stratergies (Elite troops/Close Air Support). I am lucky that I can overlook most of this and enjoy the game.\n\nThe verdict:I like the game, and whilst much work is going on to improve it, with the British expansion coming out there is much uncertainty as to how they might affect things. But one thing for sure is that such a large update will keep the game fresh for a while longer.\n\nUPDATE: 22/7/2015Things are vastly improved, and the review has been editted above. Relic are listening to feedback, they are making intelligent choices and the game is getting a much needed revamp. Shame it didn't come two years ago.","February 14, 2015","true","709.7"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","6"

Yes it does have its faults, and what faults (hopefully) you may be asking?\n\nPros\n+ The game has spectacular replay value\n+ The game offers so much as for tatctics\n+ The graphical Fidelity is BEUTIFUL\n+ NOT intirely a pay-to-win process, more like TF2 and it's hats, you can find one just about every 2 months as a random drop, or you can go ahead and buy it in the in-game market. Same thing applies to Intel Bullitens and Commanders and Unit Skins.\nI could go on, but at what cost....\n\nCons\n- The game is very demanding in terms of Computer Hadrware, ranging from mass CPU usage, to requiring a pretty powerful GPU.\n- To play beutifuly on the game, it is recommened that you have 16 GB of RAM, due to things, from the map it's self with the addon of dead and alive units, and Phisycs having to be rendered.\n- This has to be a DLC King, reason being is that DLC's litter the place, Unit skins and skin packs, to commanders and their packs, to the Theater of War DLCs to the Factions/Armies.\n- Low grade PCs will have anurisms trying to run this game for mid-game, early game.\n- Your given two factions total win buying the base game, the Soviets and the Whermacht, the other three you have to buy in packs, $20 USD for 2 more Armis, including he $12 USD for the Bitish/Common Wealth? Strange times we live in.\nPersonally it's hard to choose a side for this game, I mean once you have all the DLCs, you feel content almost, or complete. With the additive to having those said DLCs, you have Variety for your gameplay!\n\nI have a PC that can hand the game at Max Graphics, minus the antialiasing, which takes a huge chunk out of performance for an excellent picture, but by me having a PC that can handle this, I have no negative outlook on the game in the section of Frames (if I can even incude that).\n\nAlass, I'll leave it up to you weather this game is fun or not, my 400 hours plus says something, but I'm on an unbalance sadly.","December 19, 2015","true","545.2"," 34 of 59 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","34","59","2","4"

This game is really the best RTS game of all time. So I think its the best if I start with the positive components of this game, not atleast to justify my thesis.\n\nRelic really tried to configure this game very realistic, and yeah, in this point they were successfull. The models and textures are just perfect fitting into a WW 2nd-based game. Now we have 5 factions in this game, with the main idea to create the game that there is always a faction for anybody. Each faction just feels very different during playing, so the "spectrum" is very large. The so called "true-sight-system"(the engine always calculates the line of sight of all units non-stop) of this game -which is excellent- allows very very much tactical possibilities, I say more than in a usual and more public RTS game. This makes this game so special compared to other RTS games, and in a ♥♥♥♥ing good way :D. Many people say, that the faction are unbalanced at the moment. I can`t really share this thesis. Especially in the early game, factions like OKW or British Forces seem OP. The reason for this is that they cannot be countered like other factions, here you need another strat. I am notsaying that this game is perfectly balanced. but saying the whole game is just unbalanced is wrong.\n\nAnd now the negative components...\nFor me, the most annoying thing of this game is the fact that the matchmaking system is just ♥♥♥♥ing broken. Way more than a half of the games are extremely unfair, and it`s no matter if you compare the Rank-game-ladder-level or the level of the "prestige/star-system", you have very much of those matches. And I think newcomers become a bit frustrated as a result of this, when they have many matches vs top-players, and decent players become annoyed and start getting mad on the newcomers, when they loose matches because of them. Of course I know that it`s impossible to make only fair games in a multiplayer game, but the rate of unfair games is just a bit too high for my part. Thats just my thesis as a result of experience. Another component, as I already said, is the balance system of the factions. Basically, it is really ok, there are just still a few units that allow very very lame strats (e. g. King Tiger + Jagdtiger combination).\n\nCoH2 is my very favorite game. But to be honest, the negative components I summarised are not so "hard" for experienced players like me, newcomers suffer more because of them I guess.","February 10","true","640.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

BLOODY GREEDY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S OF RELIC that is the real issue at hand. You might say how can u "not recommend" a game if you hardly played half an hour of it. Well the game didn't let me play more because u see, for skirmish I have only 1 army option that lucky enough came with a bundled dlc otherwise I wouldn't have had that even, you must pay to get another faction options for skirmish. I said to myself well okay let's go to the campaign then and see if the storyline is any better and maybe it will even unlock some of the skirmish stuff for me. WRONG I have chosen the campaign I want, set the difficulty and was amazed to see that instead of a 'play' button there is a 'purchase' button. That's right my friends you have to purchase even the campaign so that is unplayable as well. Lastly before I head right for the uninstall button and hope that Relic die in agony for the greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s they are I decided at least to give the "Theater Of War" mode a try, so what we have there are four famous WWII operations, so I chose "Barbarosa" and guess what no bloody "play" button again instead u get the f'in "purchase" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t so, yes you must buy those too. End of the day what do I get for spending my bucks on this game - well you get Menus Simulator 2014 and some nice menu background music that sadly gets repetitive after the 5th loop - I guess you must buy a different tune as well.

It was my first introduction to the COH franchise, and what a pleasant experience it has been-for the most part. Skip further down if you're only interested in why I'm not recommending this game.\n\nPros\n+Setting and environments bring the battles to life, and the scenery (while pretty) is vital for your survival\n+Interface is polished and easily maneuvered, even for new players\n+Decent variety of units for each of the playable armies\n+Wide selection of beautifully crafted historical maps\n+Unit battles are satisfying and intense, especially between armored vehicles\n+Quick-paced, dynamic gameplay forces you to think, strategize, and adapt\n+Workshop is filled with incredible player-made content including skins, maps, decals, etc\n+Overall incredible feel\n\nCons\n-War spoil system is broken. Drops take hours, forcing players to purchase skins or commanders outright. It would take YEARS to get a good amount of spoil through actual gameplay. Relic is taking advantage of their players by intentionally monetizing the broken spoils system\n-DLC prices are outrageous, as are the in-game customizations\n-Unit movement and response can be frustrating at times\n-Balance issues still unresolved\n\nDespite how much I enjoy this game, and all of the time I've sunk into it, I would advise against buying it unless it's on discount. The war spoils are never going to be fixed, and although it seems rash to give COH2 a negative review based on that system, it's extremely disheartening (and annoying) to play 10 games in a row and not see a single drop. It undermines an otherwise quality game.","January 28","false","153.8"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","8"

The thing is that each faction has some advantage over the other. For example, OKW are extremely potent tank killers. US forces are much more mobile and much stronger than the standard infantry units, they are great for those that like being aggressive and maintaining continous pressure on the enemy. Russians are by nature a german infantry unit's worst nightmare, they are extremely capable when it comes to wiping squads: Katuskayas, B4's, 152mm arty, KV-8 flamethrower tanks, Shock Troops, t-34's that are still very good at running over troops, ISU-152's, IS-2's- the Russians are opposite of OKW: they are extremely effective infantry killers. Whermacht is a great defensive faction, the bunkers are versatile and if combined with mortars and paks, access to the surrounding territory is denied to the enemy. The British forces have extremely powerful units all around and bear firepower capable of completely disassembling any Tiger variant and never mind infantry. Also, every faction has many different commanders and abilities that are allow players to change the course of battles. Now with this all said, can this game ever reach a balanced state? The answer is it is impossible.\nRelic along with the other publishers have made such a versatile game with many different advantages that there is simply no way the game would reach this so called balance that players are so frivilously pleaing for. The W/L ration players have is ultimately left in our hands to change. Yes, the OKW leaderboard W ratio is very high and yes 4v4 would be a HELL of a lot better if OKW didn't have not 3 but 5 ranks of veterancy level and panzershecks. However, step out of 4v4 and play a 1v1 match and notice the difference, look at the gameplay, the striving to hold territory, maintaining units across the entire battlefield: 1v1 games plays like COH should. The problem is that in 4v4 everyone rushes and congregates around fuel, rushes tanks, and then gg. That isn't a game, and as I recall, the online ranked matches were about holding victory points, not fuel but this is what 4v4 games have become. Don't believe me, play the 4v4 map Steppes and watch where players go, they don't go to top where ammo and victory points are, they traditionally, almost instinctively, go to the bottom of the map where fuel is then work their way to top. Now not every game plays the same and not all my claims hold true in every circumstance, but just like the developers of Star Citizen in their efforts to create a persistent universe, Relic has made a persisent and ever changing stragetic game where no two battles are alike. A players best option: watch a few profressional COH2 1v1 matches on youtube and look at everything thats going on ,then step out 4v4 and try 1v1 or 2v2 games. It is the perhaps the best way to learn and become a better player in COH2.","January 7","true","466.8"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","18","29","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ClassyWolf/recommended/231430/","ClassyWolf","Classy^^","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ClassyWolf/","328 products in account","First of all, I've played the orginial Company of Heroes a lot. I had around 200 hours into the original Company of Heroes game (not reflected in steam hours due to me having it played a pirated version with friends untill I finally bought the game a few years later on) which I've been playing from time to time on an amateur level for around 4 to 5 years. That being said, I'm just the average player in Company of Heroes.\nNow, I have conflicting thoughts about Company of Heroes 2.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n- Poorly optimised:\nThis is a big issue, I'm running this game on an 2600k processor with a gtx770 graphics card aswell as having 16gb ddr3 of memory while the game is installed on an HDD, (TL:DR mid-tier pc). Loading times are crazy, even if you have this game stored on an SSD ,your opponent might not have done the same so you will still be forced to wait untill both of you have loaded in so that you can play. No, don't store this game on an SSD, not worth it.\nThe framerate is also terrible, I first played this game on 'recommended' settings and noticed my framerate going below 60 a lot. In the recommended settings everything was pretty much changed to normal, the game on normal settings looks even worse than the original CoH, literally. So I tried max settings, to see what it would look like. Strange enough after I've maxed out the game (a part from AA, set that on 2x) I surprisingly had a higher FPS, wait what? I don't know how much these devs have been jerking off at their office while they were just coding this game in general, but my cpu is always at 100% while my gpu is around 50%. This game, together with other games known for being poorly optimised only make my CPU bottleneck my GPU, it's not on my end.\nMultiplayer games also stutter a lot, even if both ends have great connections. Not sure what's going on there either.\n\n- User interface:\nThe user interface is one big mess, all sorts of icons of different colours and artstyles everywhere, they are not fitting together plus common usage of extremely ugly colours. I feel like they should completely redo the user interface.\nThe visual assistance in the maps also looks terrible when it comes to territory control, each flag has a circle around it with a colour which represents the player who's holding it, but it also has another outline which is where the border is when it comes to other flags. So you basically have reasonably large circle around the flag itself and also borderlines around. This makes it look like a complete mess, should have stuck with the orginal Company of Heroes design when it comes to that.\nThe minimap is also extremely bad, it's hard to find units on there. Needs to be redone.\n\n- The DLC:\nNot going to write a lot about this since it's already everywhere, the devs should stop releasing DLC with an overpriced tag to it. To me, the game is only worth it with all the DLC, otherwise it's just lacking units in general. So if you're only getting the basegame, you're going to have a boring time playing it. All the curent DLC should have been available since day-one or in updates.\n\n- The Ardennes campaign:\nNo, you're an RTS game, not a rogue-like game. The Ardennes campaign is ridiculous, after you've lost enough missions it will prompt you with a screen saying "FAILURE" and you will have to redo every single mission again, starting from the start. It's kind of hilarious how I started the campaign at the normal difficulty while the AI was definitely ranged above the hard AI setting. I recommend playing the campaign on easy, even if you can beat the AI on normal and on hard (my case).\n\n- Boosters\nNow, I used to be a Counter-Strike player, I'm extremely font of the idea of only offering cosmetics for money, nothing else. A game should also be extremely balanced and both sides should  have the exact same chance to win if they would have the exact same amount of skill.\nThis game rewards you with playing by giving you boosters every now and then, which means they are rewarding good players with perks such as having a tank deal more damage, or infantry having more accuracy, please get rid of this. Cosmetics is what it should stay at, never reward players by making them even stronger, their experience itself should make them strong enough already. Sad part is that you can even buy these boosters together with commanders and other things.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n- Still has all the great mechanics from the original Company of Heroes, they have made a few changes here and there, such as having green cover while infrantry is walking next to heavy tanks etc. Really great improvements in general a part from a few things which I've mentioned here above. The multiplayer system is also pretty decent, you can earn XP for winning and losing matches, you can unlock cosmetics and slight boosts, the cosmetic part is fine but the boosts are absolutely not, e.g commanders and the other assets which slightly improve a select amount of things. (e.g riflemen have 3% more accuracy).\n\n- The matchmaking system is pretty great, I've played multiplayer a few times, usually matches me up within 30 seconds against a player of similair skill. Had a few mismatches a few times but that I don't mind, I'd actually prefer to play against better players since I could learn from them. (and secretly I have won them all too)\n\n- Nice visuals if you can run it, eventhough it's poorly optimised, the game looks decent on max settings. Really gives me a kick sometimes when I call in an airstrike with lets say rockets to take out hostile light armour.\n\n\nMy common sense is telling me I shouldn't enjoy this game due to it's way of making money and poor optimisation, but this is all outweighted by the good old Company of Heroes legendary gameplay mechanics.","September 6, 2015","true","41.2"," 28 of 48 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","28","48","2","0"

They're selling you DLC for full-game prices.

PLUS there's an expansion for the campaign that costs money as well? And it's only a new US Forces squad?\n\nI really do not mind the use of DLC to expand the experience, but it really feels like I'm being ripped off by purchasing CoH2. Even though I got it on a great sale. I bought the sale bundle and got DLC that I can't even use without the US Forces Campaign DLC, which wasn't included in the DLC bundle. Seriously? So now I either buy a $40 DLC, or I live with the fact I bought DLC I literally cannot use.\n\nIn all honesty, I enjoyed CoH1 more anyway. There are a few improvements to CoH2, but not enough for me to justify telling anyone to buy CoH2 and ALL the DLCs being made.\n\nStick with CoH1.

This would be the only reason why i still play this game. On with the gripes now.\n\nPROS=\nNeat little "true sight" adds a depth of realism and strategy to the mix of RTS. Cleverly placing a bunker in an alley facing outwards with a mg42 can trap soviet infantry real quick.\nThis is WWII and Coh baby and thus nice things happen. Things happen like hearing what sounds like a tank rolling around near by making you feel as if your that soldier. "Tiger!!!" lol. Or plowing a Tiger through a wall  and spooking the hell out your enemy. Sound is amazing especially if you have a sound system or a decent pair of headphones.\nNow with the map builder theres an endless amount of maps and game modes available to you and honestly you dont have to touch it. Just hop on the Steam Workshop and Presto your looking at creative map from players like you and me.\nI do like the variety of generals and the different supports they offer but... theres always a but.\n\nCons=\n... I dislike that theres always one support you want that is not on the general you need. You cant pick and choose and you always have a support that you will not use or that is usless to your playstyle. There still seems to be glitches here and there. one of them that is quite annoying is the german mg42 will set up and not fire for some time. a couple seconds nothing to crazy but thats all it takes for soviet infantry to rush up and throw a molotov. Today I sat in a game and had to tell my pioneer squad to rapair my PZR4 5 times!!! NO!! i need that repaired like YESTERYEAR! Multiplayer. Multiplayer. Multiplayers nice. If you mind waiting for at least 10 min at times. Other than that its quite fun actually. The biggest problem though is within the ai itself and that is blamed on the creators. Im not going to lie I only play Germans since i picked up the game during beta. The last two updates have beefed up the soviets pretty good. Mortors now no longer need a scout. infantry spam is plentyfull and boy do they use it. molotovs are a cheap commodity and is also used. QUITE OFTEN! and i dont frown upon that. During WWII soviets had more than double the infantry compaed to the Germans. The only thing that differed though is training. Im pretty sure an MG42 team will mow down the hell out of 2 squads of soviet infantry thats 5 feet in front of them. but no soviets somehow have that finese to run straight up almost every time and toss that flaming bottle of love. The  harder you choose the ai the more it will cheat. I played regular dificulty and i could manage on my own and if i screwed up i can regain the map rather quickly. Now that is not true. Ill get infantry spammed, and before i get my first tank out the enemy will have 2 and plenty of support. ???? seriously! and its just the same with 2 players vs ai. Actually its worse because 2 tanks turns to 4 and infantry spamming and molotov spamming doubles. I like doubling coupons not molotovs or tanks grenades. -_- soviets had numbers and cold(and Vodka). Germans had training, tactics and better tanks.\n\noh and yes DLC is a pain. Sure they need to make the money and all but theres a limit. The least you can do is offer everything to those who pre ordered way before to kickstart the funds. -_- greed is the fire that burns our soul.\n\nWait to buy this game when its at a lower price\n\n","January 5, 2014","false","352.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

Being a fan of the First CoH and even taking part in the Fileplanet beta back in 2006 Company of Heroes 2 was everything that the word disappointed embodies. The game has no real content that sets it apart from the first one. The game play is not just banal when compared to the original title but when comparing it to other RTS that were inspired by this title. One thing I noticed early on was their was no "WoW' moments and the AI seems to be worst. Digressing back to no "WoW" moments. In the original CoH  when playing a hard long fought out match or maybe even early game and someone uses a smart flank or tactic that you over looked or didn't expect, maybe someone builds or calls in a unit that makes both teams have that "wow"moment. Those moments that causes both teams to be re-energize. Sending both teams on a emotion rollercoaster to hold or defend or revamp or rethink an attack or withdraw or maybe a full retreat of a area they have held the whole game. If you're looking for that then this is not the game for you.

You develope good strategies and then get hit very hard  and are forced to adapt and develope new strategies.  All in all, this is good as playing the same thing again and again gets mundane very quickly.\n\nI don't know if there was an update that did this or if it was something that I didn't relize until the last month or so of playing; however, the pathing mechanics of vehicles seems to have gotten very bad.  What I call idiocy will happen with tanks when they are trying to fall back where they will either back into something, stop, turn 90 degrees, move, then turn back to continue to fall back; get clustered all together shortly after the order and effectively ram into one another; or they will "butt wiggle" and move a meter, turn a bit, move a meter, turn some more, move a meter and continue on this process until they manage to make it to where you want them to go minutes later or (since the order to fall back was given) are shot and blown up.\n\nMost everything about this game is good but I do take exception to the pathing mechanics mostly of the vehicles, though squads can do similar things and retreat forward/into a satchel charge and be annhilated.  Given that this happens at intense times of fighting and typically several times a match, I think there may be an issue with the code somewhere; however, it has brought enough frusteration for me and those I play with to uninstall the game entirely.","September 12, 2014","false","118.0"," 30 of 52 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","30","52","0","0"

Nice and long. But it does suffer a bit in my opinion from the fact that it tries to cover the entire thing from Barbarossa to Berlin and ends up being a bit unfocused. Personally think it would have benefitted much from focusing on a single event like Operation Bagration.\n\nMultiplayer as always is a tricky thing in regards to balance as things generally change as new ideas are mixed in. Was with CoH and so it is with CoH2. But overall balance is great there's always an option for a clever player and generally i don't feel like you're shoe-horned into a specific response.\n\nSo overall. A most recommendable game and a must play if you were to ask me.","November 26, 2013","true","262.4"," 569 of 1,077 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","569","1","0","4"

I love the first one, it's well balanced, tactical and not just Age of Empires without the resource gathering. Oh and yeah it has no micro transactions. COH 2 is simply a case of whoever has the most infantry wins untill tanks come along and then who has the most tanks win. However thing is you don't get access to the full tech tree, you only get access to certain units past the basic 7 or so, to get access to more you unlock with your commanders of which you only can have one per match. Like the first game right? Nope. In this game there are heaps of them and you get three commanders at the start for free, (which you don't choose) and they give you a couple of units, every other one you have to buy with real world dollars unless you get lucky and get them as a reward and of course these are the ones with fun and powerful units. Want a KV flame tank? That will be $6, a Pershing? Another 6, want British Engineers who can salvage scraps? Time to get the credit card out and pay some more.\n\nSo basically if you like pay to win micro transactions, spamming infantry in a numbers game then this game is for you. Otherwise buy the first one.","May 4","false","94.9"," 44 of 79 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","44","79","2","1"

And its gonna be long, but If you're serious about getting this game I suggest you read through it.\n\nBalance:\nOne of the most important things for a developer should be game balance right? Should come right after mechanics on the list of things to perfect. Well not Relic, its just content, content, more content, had enough content yet? And its like, yay thats good right? Long game long life? well no. Despite having "beta" tries before releasing large content updates (most recently the UKF) they still blatantly miss so many clearly unfair advantages that factions have. The list is too long to put here. Although they do usually fix it eventually, it takes weeks and even months for problems that clearly should have been patched in the beta.\n\nMechanics:\nAnyone whos played this game will tell you that unit pathfinding is sometimes the most infuriating thing you've ever seen. Tanks that do donuts, scout cars that go around the map to get to the other side of a bridge, Mortar getting up and walking into the enemy line when you tell it to fire, etc. While one of the core aspects of Company of heroes is to require a lot of user input so your troops don't get shelled, having to check to make sure your units actually do what you tell them to do is just frustrating.\n\nMultiplayer and Map design:\nThe Multiplayer ranking system that pairs you with opponents, while initally is helpful, eventually will put you at a rank where you can get paired up with people new to the game and people that haven't stopped playing since 2013\nMost of the really good maps in CoH2 are not available in multiplayer automatch.\n\nContent, oh god, the content:\nYou'd assume a lot of content was a good thing, but just to put things in perspective, if you were to take all DLC to date for CoH2 at full price, including the game itself, you would spend over $370. For a game that still has mechanic failures and glitches, thats just sad.\n\nDeveloper Abandonment:\nThe are numerous units, abilities, commanders, maps, game modes, etc, that the devs changed way back in the day, and never touched it again, rather than balance current content in the game, they just release unbalanced new content.\n\nRandom Number Generator:\nUnlike some other RTS games, Like Age of Empires or Supreme Commander, when any units engage each other on the battlefield, while there are a number of factors as to who will win, a very large part is simply wether the game decides you win or not. This game is more luck based than any game I've seen short of card games. It is entirely possible, extremely unlikely, but entirely possible for a T-70 light tank to kill a King Tiger in a head on engagement. Wether your tank hits or not is up to chance, and wether it actually goes through is also up to chance, and wether pathfinding will let either tank run away is up to chance.\n\nAnd most importantly,\nDeveloper Greed:\nThis game is an obvious cash-grab, but it didn't start out that way. Now take a look at their plan. They release unbalanced content, and don't fix it for weeks-months, so everybody buys it, because they want the advantage. Almost every single DLC to date has followed that pattern. They have a drop system for in game items that is so rare, and so inconsitent, so out of your control that you are compelled to want to buy a doctrine you want to try because you know you'll never get it otherwise.\n\nI know its a dying game, but if you like the RTS genre and WW2, get Company of Heroes 1 and its two DLC, it has its own balance issues, but it's more well made than this game. It was made back when the developers actually gave a dam.","September 7, 2015","false","308.0"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","16","26","0","2"

There are not a lot of units to choose from and play around with. There is only one emplacement for the American team (machine gun nest) and it more or less immune to small arms fire. One guy with a .50 cal in a sandbag circle should not be able to take 10 minutes of fire from a half track from 10 feet away. The "tech tree" is almost non existant, making leveling up useless. To be straight to the point, the only thing I like about this game is on the American side they have supply tents with different weapons.

COH2 is a world war 2 RTS game where you capture control points to get fuel, munitions, and manpower. You can play as different ww2 factions which have different units and strategies. If you've ever had any interest in WW2, you owe it to yourself to play this game.\n\nThe multiplayer is a very strong part of this game and I found it to be enjoyable. It's especially fun to team up with a friend against other people and have a good time. There is both a serious part of the multiplayer ladder and a casual part, so every skill level does well.\n\nMy one complaint about this game is the pay to win commander selection. Commanders dictate which special abilities you get (for instance a special tank call in or an air strike). Some of the commanders you get by paying for them or being very very lucky and getting them in a drop.","January 13","true","366.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Buy some commanders.\n\nWant to have a full and fair game experience? You're gonna have to pay for it.\n\nWant a bug-free, polished and immersive experience? You came to the wrong place, mate.\n\nPlayers should not have to spend huge amounts of money on DLC in the vain hope of fixing a game that should never have been broken in the first place.\n\nProbably, many of those who purchased DLC simply could not bear another minute of the disgustingly in-your-face advertising and constant prompts to pay for full access to the game that they had already paid for that they gave in and handed over more cash to make the pain go away.\n\nThe commercialisation of this game is sickening and goes to show just how cynical, greedy and contemptful of gamers SEGA, and the big publishers really have become.\n\nSEGA may not have dealt a death-blow to Company of Heroes, but with CoH2 they've left it curled in the fetal position begging for mercy.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFull Review:\n\nCompany of Heroes was easily one of the best RTS games produced in recent years. The gritty gameplay, steep learning curve and atmosphere that Relic created in CoH:1 through the wartorn environments and spot on audio made for an impressively immersive experience. Tactical decisions felt utterly crucial at every moment, and it was easy to vicariously feel the terror and exuberation of your soldiers as they pushed through enemy lines or faced certain, crushing death.\n\nIn CoH:2 the game has had a facelift and along with the addition of new vehicles, units and armies the scope of the franchise is greater than ever before. The addition of the Soviet forces was a much-needed expansion to the game's world, story, and gameplay and the developers have obviously set out with a clear vision to extend the legacy of CoH:1.\n\nSadly, however, CoH2 is neither the sequel that CoH1 deserved nor the sequel that fans of the series deserved.\n\nThe graphics have indeed been improved, but stunning artistic vision and attention to detail count for nought when a game's optimisation is mediocre at best. Expect janky performance when in the middle of a fierce battle unless you're playing on a remarkably powerful rig. It's not game-breaking, but it undermines the immersive fluidity that is so key to any RTS and which Relic did so well on in CoH1.\n\nSimilarly, while the audio is as lush as ever to listen to, I've nonetheless experienced ridiculous mistimings. On several occasions battle music has started playing long after the firefight was well and truly over. Poor audio cues like this again undermine the immersive experience that made CoH1 and should have made CoH2 great.\n\nHowever, the greatest tragedy and travesty of CoH2 is the complete in-your-face, buy-buy-buy, spoon-feeding of DLC at every available opportunity. I loaded the game up for the first time in anticipation of a solid sequel and eager to see the changes from CoH1 only to discover that the most prominent change was a massive banner advertisement and constant prompts telling me that I should drop more cash on the game I had already paid for.\n\nFrankly, the over-commercialisation of this game is sickening.\n\nSure, it's not straight up pay to win, but you can't deny that having more commanders and armies provides players who choose to pay extra for them with far greater tactical flexibility and thus opportunity (at least) to win. Commander choice is not determinative of victory, but it can go a long way. This is especially true when a DLC-purchaser knows you only have access to the standard commanders and they can therefore plan to utterly steamroll you with the commander they paid 12 bucks for.  The uneven playing field which the developers have intentionally created to make money off of feels profoundly unjust.\n\nThis is especially true because of the nature of the RTS genre. I enjoy RTS games for the same reason I enjoy playing chess, cards or any other such game with friends, because it provides a chance to directly put your mental mettles to the test. The tendency towards pay to win in this game undermines that chance for a fair fight. I expect this from mediocre shooters, not from big name RTS franchises.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with releasing solid amounts of DLC for games where time and thought is put into them and (most importantly!) they don't undermine the experience of the game for players who exclusively own the core game. The problem is that on both these counts, and spectacularly on the latter, CoH2 is a failure.\n\nI can't speak for everyone else, but there's only so much callously in your face DLC-pushing that I can handle before I end up walking away from a game starting to feel sick in my mouth. This is not what I expected, wanted, or deserved from CoH2. It should not cost hundreds of dollars after the fact to have full and fair access to the contents of an RTS game.\n\nSure, you could choose to sink a few hours into this game and you probably wouldn't have an awful time. It still looks and sounds good, and the core gameplay is solid enough. There are even some neat additions. But the fresh lick of paint that might have tricked you into thinking you just bought a mint new Porsche is going to quickly peel away to reveal the rusty 1976 Skoda shitwagon that SEGA have buried beneath.\n\nIf you buy this game you're effectively lining the pockets of skeezy corporate salesmen who don't care about the consumer and just want to make a quick buck by spamming us with intrusive, underwhelming and game-ruining DLC. Don't fall for their tricks. Do not buy Company of Heroes 2.","December 12, 2014","false","147.3"," 51 of 94 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","51","94","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/231430/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Company of Heroes 2 comes off strong with its new campaign, and it packs an impressive amount of extra features. Standing on its own, it is an impressive real-time strategy game, but there are people who want to know what makes this better than the beloved original Company of Heroes. The simple answer to that question is that it's more of what they love.The sequel brings a new campaign, new multiplayer maps and units, new co-op modes, more explosions, more units on the field, and deathly winter combat, all presented with the gameplay that made the first such a hit. It stays true to its roots while bringing in enough new, compelling content to make it worthwhile.The sequel to one of the best strategy titles out there, Company of Heroes 2 lives up to its predecessor. The game focuses on the Eastern front of World War II, and during the campaign the player takes on the role of the Russians. It's a slow-paced RTS, with a big emphasis placed on unit placement and having troops stay behind cover if they want to survive.The utterly fantastic campaign is among the best I have played in a strategy game. Missions are varied enough that different tactics have to be used to win each one. There are some defense missions that are so hectic I had to constantly readjust my troops to face new attacks coming from all sides. One mission takes place in the snow, and you have to prevent your troops from freezing to death by moving close to fires, or keeping them inside.Another one of my favorites involved hunting down and destroying a Tiger tank, which I ultimately accomplished by luring it into a series of mines I placed as a trap. There are 14 missions in the campaign, and each one takes between 20-60 minutes to complete depending on the difficulty and how terrible you are at playing.All of the new mechanics fit well with the Eastern Front setting. Lots of soldiers will die, and CoH2 does a brilliant job of making it expensive to lose troops.Taking over an enemy territory will certainly require you to sacrifice a lot of men, and sometimes you'll have to do it knowing you won't be able to replace them easily.I was always faced with some form of a choice with each unit. "Do I have them run in and face certain death, or do I hold back and wait for a better opportunity?" Better opportunities don't always come, and sometimes the only way to win the battle is to lose a fight.Alongside the campaign, there is the "Theater of War" mode which includes a series of co-op and single-player missions and scenarios. This mode is meant to provide more battles along the Eastern front that don't tie in directly to the campaign.The scenarios are tightly-focused missions revolving around one aspect of the war that year, and they are some of my favorite missions in the game. Company of Heroes 2 shines the brightest for me when I have three squads and keeping them alive is insanely hard. The co-op missions are large-scale battles that pit players against a computer opponent; the rest are simply single-player missions that use the multiplayer maps and have a computer opponent.There is a competitive multiplayer, of course. It's what gave the first game such a long life, and it's just as solid in the sequel. It plays out the same as in the first game, either with players fighting over control points or simply trying to demolish each other. This time around there are all new maps and units, which is enough to make me want to play the same style of game. If you are a classic fan of the series and you're only interested in the multi-player, it's hard to say if you'll find enough here invest in this if you already played the first.Company of Heroes 2 brings the classic gameplay of the original game into the modern era. It has all of the familiar mechanics while embracing new technology to make everything look and respond better. The physics are very realistic, and just about everything can be destroyed.All of the cover can be destroyed if the other guy has a big enough gun. Hiding behind a fence might be great for stopping bullets, but tank is going to destroy the wall and everyone behind it.Company of Heroes 2 is an excellent real-time strategy game. The campaign is challenging, varied, and true to the setting of the war. The atmosphere is intense and filled with bass-rumbling sounds, and an orchestral score that provides the perfect background. It's visually impressive, yet manages to run at a smooth frame rate.Company of Heroes 2 is shining example of what an RTS game should be: a mix of classic mechanics with new features and technology.","March 2, 2015","true","160.7"," 56 of 104 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","56","104","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sm0k1/recommended/231430/","Sm0k1","Ansvar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sm0k1/","215 products in account","Summary:\n[+] This game is a wonderful one. It's fun, has a lot of small things to take into account and a great variation depending on which team you play. The small things matter which is always lovely in a strategy based game. Many maps and a hell of a war-feeling to it.\n\n[-] However, the current state of the Matchmaking system, is seriously broken and will put you up against people with 10-20 times the in-game hours you've got.\n\nVerdict: Don't buy this game unless you're prepared to spend numerous (hundreds) hours playing against bots. Because the MM will show you just how bad you are at the game and you won't get a chance to turn the games around or understand what you did wrong, because the good players are so beyond your level of play that you'll be a bleeding kitten swimming in a pool of hungry piranhas.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt the moment I've invested 31 hours into this game. I played CoH back in the day and had a lot of hours and know the game mechanics fairly well. When me and a friend (40 hours played) search for matches, we get matched with people who've prestiged one, two and sometimes even three times.\n\nHow can they claim the MM-system is a working one?\nI have yet to have a game with people at the same skill level as me. At the same time they claim that the MM-system actually is fair and should match you against players at the same level as yourself.\nHow come it doesn't then?\n\nI see a lot of posts on the internet regarding this, some people (good at the game, many hours) defend this, because if they get matched with a good player(s) they will have a chance because of their skill level. Many people (mostly not so good, few hours) are complaining they simply can't use MM at all because of the uneven matchmaking that currently rules the games.\n\nI will lose interest in this game way before I reach that level. It's simply to challenging and not fun to be matched up against players with 700+ hours. At the same time it's not realistic that a game forces you to play 200 hours against bots before you can even try to make a difference in 2v2, 3v3, 4v4.\n\nThe 1v1 is pretty much 50/50. Sometimes you get a player closer to your skill level, sometimes you get one with a hell of a lot more time invested than yourself.\n\nI'm sick of this and I have yet to find a post from developers that take this criticism seriously, no matter how constructive it might be.\n\nI'm sad to give this a bad review as I love the game, the feel and everything around it. The MM-system is what's broken and has to be fixed. I rather stay in a queue for 25-30 minutes than get matched after 5-10 against opponents who will stomp with ease.","March 11","false","66.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

This game adds enough to feel like a true sequel as well as maintain the Company of Heroes vibe all of us RTS junkies love. The production value is high, the dynmanic way the multiplayer matches play out makes the game always exciting and interesting. Each match feels different.\n\nThe single player is engaging and tells an excellent story about the dark side of the Red Army while showing there were alot of good men and women who fought bravely to stop the Nazi domination of their country. The graphics look fantastic, the sound design is top notch and really immerses you in the game.\n\nThere in addition to the Campaign and Multiplayer aspect is the Theater of War mode, which adds fun challanges, which are solo and some are coop to play with friends. This feature is hoped to expand across the entire war, as of now it is only Early war which is proving incredibly difficult and nearly impossible on General difficulty but Pounder and I just suck lol.\n\nThis game is a great run for youre money. It has some well thought out features. Twitch integration for people who want to try out streaming their game, but have no experiance or money to pay for Xsplit or don't want to fuddle around with OBS software to stream. It makes things simple and fun to stream.\n\nThere is an excellent road map with up to a year or more content planned and expanded for the game. New commanders, New Maps, New cammo patterns for youre tanks and units, A fully secure Ladder is promised for multiplayer in the near future, as well as Observer mode for us shoutcasters!!\n\nPick COH2 up if you even remotely like Real Time strategy or the Second World War.\n","July 6, 2013","true","573.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Especially on 4v4 MP matches this games become great on the endgame when you have tank battles like in kursk and you fight for every point as your tickets amount become low. You then face a sometimes little disturbing battles where many soldiers die for holding this point and you realise how hard war can be when a single salve of artillery fire kills 20 of your brave elite soldierts who did everything to follow your order.\n\nThe singleplayer is also nice and I really wish they had spent more effort German and allied campaigns.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Great RTS with many options and ways to achieve victory\n+ Cool mechanics and graphics\n+ awesome atmosphere\n\nnegs:\n\n- Bugs (they are plenty of them)\n- Devs. not caring about bugs and prefering to sell more useless skins on 5 GB updates every week\n- every replay you save will become incompatible with every "skin update"......\n- Not very popular, it sometimes takes ages until you find a MP game to join in\n\nConclusion:\n\nI love this game despite the bugs and greedy devs not caring at all. It would be nice if a company like blizzard was behind this project, then we would get a gaming experience that reaches levels you never expected but sadly, this will never happen.\n\nWhat ever, I'd buy again, but not the CE as I spend more than 100 € for it to have to buy every single DLC for like 20 - 30 €...

This game is little portions of content for a lot of money and everything else cut out of it and in separate, smaller packages to just ♥♥♥♥ you of even more money.

There is no strategy in this except to blob.\n\nThe maps are hideous and no time was put into any of them.

With 6 compelling campaigns and awesome mods and maps to play with after getting bored with the vanilla version, I got hooked real quick, I probably spent a good 200+ hours playing it off and on for the past 2 years.  The campaigns had the same feeling as the first 2 Call of Duties mixed with a hint of Band of Brothers.\n\nSince I loved COH1 so much, I decided to disregard the enormous amount of negative reviews and get it anyways.\n\nCOH2 is originally set on the Eastern Front, which suffice to say is better than the Eastern Front mod for COH1 in so many ways. Mainly, I like COH2 more because it comes with a great campaign, and doesn't require you to force restart your OP PC every time you try to boot up a game.\n\nThat being said, the campaign storyline in COH2 was a little better than if you compared them side-by-side with any of the COH1 campaigns. It felt a little more cheesy and CoD-ish than Brothers In Arms: EiB, but the same general attitude was used with great effect and had me compelled to play through the entire campaign in one sitting.\n\nThen there are of course the countless DLCs that come with this game. Mainly, most of these are microtransactions, where now instead of doctrines, there are commanders. As for the other, more formal DLCs, there are 3 more factions to choose from if you get them. Also Ardennes Assault brings a new kind of campaign that is extremely different from what you'd normally expect, It's sort of a Turn-Based strategy on top of the base game that plays differently each campaign, with "special events" where you can unlock certain vehicles for certain companies throughout the game. And then there's also mission packs, which can provide you with maybe 30 more hours of fun.\n\nSo all in all, would I recommend this game? I personally would, but only if there is a really good sale on it. The microtransactions kind of turned me off, but it wasn't gamebreaking for me. The campaign is good too, and for some it can make you walk away from it questioning your own moral integrity.

First off, the campaign is a it unrealistic since the soviets in many cases where not that brutal to their own soldiers nor their own civilians, but aside from that i found it very entertaining and you get to see a lot of the famous battles on the Eastern front. The contols are pretty much your regular RTS-game so if you are familiar with the genre you won't have a hard time to get used to them. Now, the best of the game is in the multiplayer, where you can play as fout different armies if you whave the Western Front Armies expansion. All these armies are varied and in my opinon well balanced, which gives a very enjoyable and competetive gaming experiance. There is also lots of different commanders to choose from which gives you five special abilities which consists of everything from an airstike to a heavy tank.

How did a game that focuses on micromanaging troops in combat screw this up so badly?\n\n1.  First you have to click on the unit. Sounds simple enough, but for some reason I had a lot of difficulty with this. For some reason, units would not always select / de-select on the first click, sometimes it took two clicks or box selecting the unit to do so. That is just unacceptable. It lead to a lot of wrong orders, wasted time, and deaths. How can a game that is two years old not have that figured out?\n\n2.  Order the unit to take cover. The fact that I have to babysit each unit to order them to take cover blows my mind. How could they not code the most basic of human instincts of taking cover when being shot at? It would be one thing if the cover was far away, you did tell them to move to the open location, but if a stone wall is just 5 yards away and they are under machine gun fire, why do they wait for your command to take cover rather than just moving?\n\n3  Now make sure they actually move. In addition to waiting for a command that should not need to be ordered, once it comes, they don't always follow it. Sometimes I had to repeat orders to take cover, not because they were being pinned down by supressing fire, but because they were so busy standing and shooting they ignored me.\n\n3.  Once they actually move, make sure they take the correct positions. For some reason, my units loved to hop over and "take cover" on the wrong side of the wall. W...t...f...? At first I thought I was clicking on the wrong side of the wall, but I was not. They take cover on the right side of the wall and then jump over to chase retreating units, a command I neither gave, nor desired because there were still enemy units holding the line that quickly targeted and killed them.\n\n4.  Even though they are now in cover, you still cannot relax. One of the great features of this game is the distructible environment. The infuriating aspect of this is that your idiot troops don't shoot around cover, they shoot through it. Yes, you read that correctly, when hiding behind a wall, your troops will attempt to shoot through the wall rather than around it. Judging by tracer rounds and riccochet / impact effects, about 33%-50% of all rounds hit the wall. If they are behind a tank or truck, it's more like 50%-75%. How can they be so stupid as to destroy their own cover and shoot their own allies? How can they not figure out how to shoot over the wall or around the vehicle? I wouldn't give a ♥♥♥♥ if they hid behind the wall, closed their eyes, poked the gun out, and blind fired the entire mag aimlessly and never even came close to the target, at least they wouldn't be aiming down the sights at the wall and still shooting it. Within seconds, the wall will crumble due to the combined friendly and enemy fire and your troops will be out in the open.\n\n5.  Now that your troops have destroyed their cover and are out in the open, return to step one and repeat the process. Don't forget about your 15 other equally stupid units, they all need micromanaging too.\n\nIf this seems like your game, go for it. It's not all bad, there are some great features like weather, map details, destructible environment, and the visual and sound effects, but they all sit on the core of the game, which is ordering troops to take cover. Whether they are advancing, retreating, defending, or supressing, they need to be in cover, and because that is broken, the whole game is.\n\nNeedless to say, I do not recommend this game and am grateful I never bought it and only played on free weekends.","August 27, 2015","false","4.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","4"

The game is not very well optimised, where i could play COH (the original) on ultra, I cant even play this on medium settings?\n\nI have played this game for 50 hours, those are 50 hours too much. I want my money back and my time back.\nDo not make the same misstake as i have and buy this game.

No other game could reward players so thoroughly when they correctly anticipated an enemy's play. The sequel is almost the same, except where the original is sharp and pointed, everything in CoH2 is sort of fuzzy and mushy.\n\nIn the original, each army had a number of different ways to play, with commander trees there were distinct and powerful. An experienced player might see a Wehrmacht opponent use Propaganda War in the early game, and know they should expect a King Tiger in the late game and plan for it. Now that every army has almost a dozen possible commanders who all mix and match skills, not only does your commander choice feel less distinct, but it removes an element of strategy and counter play. Plus, you level up linearly instead of with branched trees, so that element of planning is also lost.\n\nYou can also customize armies with sort of "achievement-based" unlocks, but they just add to the fuzziness. Does a 2% faster machine gun reload matter? I can't really tell. Would I notice if my enemy had that power? Doubtful. It seems like they wanted to make your army feel personal, but didn't want to have higher level players stomp all over newer ones because their army was objectively better. The result? More fuzziness and confusion.\n\nThere's also a lack of focus in some of the gameplay itself. Snipers used to be a counter to the units like mortars and machine guns because those squads were very small. But in CoH2, the Russian army mortar and MG squads are massive, so the sniper that would make quick work of them with a good player has a much, much higher chance of being caught before they make a dent in those support squads. CoH2 took a brilliant piece of counterplay and designed it straight out of the game.\n\nIn terms of visual fidelity, the whole game looks either the same or worse compared to the original. But, the system demands seem much higher for no discenerable gain. You can still pay CoH on a pretty mediocre or aged machine, but CoH2 will choke computers that play Relic's own Dawn of War 2 without a hitch.\n\nI was really hoping that the British Forces pack would rekindle my interest in this game, but it's just more disappointment. I really like Relic and I wanted to like this.","November 21, 2015","false","27.5"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

A lot of my criticisms of the original release have by and large been resolved, though I will still point out some problems in the game.\n\nThe publishers have taken the action of raising DLC prices on their in-game Store during major sales while giving discounts to make it seem as though you are receiving discounts off the item, which is not true as it is not only unethical and anti-consumer, but is also illegal in many regions. Should I also point to the fact that there are some fairly important bugs that were only uncovered recently despite the game having been released for quite a few years now (one being veterancy gained for reinforced squads).\n\nDLC I think is still a major issue for the game, but SEGA being SEGA... Some of the DLC do affect gameplay ever so slightly which can be fairly annoying if you're just starting out and don't want to spend money on the commanders.\n\nLast but not least, I'm happy they launched the game on Linux and Mac (though not too glad the multiplayer isn't cross-platform between Windows and the other two versions - explanation from Feral here).

First off, because I really enjoyed CoH 1, and in my honest opinion, I feel this game is robbed from what made CoH such a great game. The doctrine trees, the unit models and the realism, of course it might just be me wanting to actually see the soldiers getting blown to pieces by an artillery shell. Anyway this game feels different.. It does not make me feel like I play a Company Of Heroes game other than in name.\nThe MP changes to a more comptetetive system is a great improvement, so is the difficulity in personallizing your own army, by choosing different traits or specs. It makes the game more difficult, but at the same time I feel it has lost it values.\n\nI'm not even going to get started on the market strategy that has been used here, because these DLC's are just moneygrinding. If they had done like they did with Opposing Front and Tales of Valor it would be just ok. As those games were cheap expansion, giving a great game content, to a good price. Now it has turned towards EA style money grabbing.\n\nI don't know if anyone agrees with me - or totally disagree. I just wanted to push forward my opinion.

It is a sequel to Company of Heroes.\n\nCompany of Heroes 2, has many good improvements, but also many downside. Let's start with the good thing. Company of Heroes 2 new features include new faction, new off map unit spawn, better graphics, the new Theater of War mode and more. Gameplay is absolutely better, points can now be captured just by standing inside the capture zone so infantry can focus on shooting the enemy, infantry can also now climb fences or something like that, vehicles can be abandoned when badly damaged, so we can capture and repair enemy vehicles. There is also new commander and doctrine system which make the gameplay even more vary. Modding support are also better especially with the new Steam Workshop integration. There are more to see and you will be pleased to see them.\n\nGraphics of Company of Heroes 2 are better than the first game, quite the improvements and I gotta say it's beautiful. The explosion effects, the textures variable, snow effects and stuff. It's great. They has the new snow blizzard effect that also affect gameplay, in skirmish games on snow maps blizzard can randomly happen, entirely changing the situation. Units are even more detailed with many new animations and skins for vehicles. At release and some time after that, the performance of the game was very terrible. But now finally Relic has updated the game and the performance are far more better than before, at least maybe it's because the cap it at 30 fps.\n\nBut not everything in this sequel are great. Bad things also present in this Company of Heroes 2. The campaign story. I don't know, I don't want to spoil it, but there are some things considered... what, inappropriate? Like did the old Soviet Union shoots their own soldiers or executing them for heroic act like saving their Captain who was in trouble?\n\nWell, overall, for the base game and expansion packs, I recommend this game, because it's good sequel.\n\nRating 8/10","February 1, 2015","true","180.1"," 34 of 63 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","34","63","3","1"

But I have to say, the multiplayer community is utter ♥♥♥♥. As one who only recently installed the game and thus low-level, I regularly find it impossible to complete a game half of the time even with a defeat. Noob-hating and noob-bashing are the norm. In 1v1 I was told to "try team games, because only pros do 1v1". So I did a team game, and on the very first my teammate refused to leave his base from the very beginning because he "hates playing with noobs". And so on and so forth. I bought the game to have fun, not to be bashed while I crawl to lvl 80+. I played COH/OF until the very end and it was lots of fun, but I'm sorry to say I'm going to uninstall this one and I think with a "community" like this, the game is doomed to die out very soon.","March 7, 2015","false","19.7"," 36 of 67 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","36","67","0","5"

While this is quite difficult to master, it is extremely rewarding.\n\nFor example:\nWhile you are simultaneously turning your machine-gun around to face a flank attack, you need to dodge the enemy grenade with your forward infantry, cancel your mortar attack, re-direct your AT, create a new squad of troops, and release covering smoke from your tank.\n-You will eventually get used to the intense micromanaging pace this game sets.\nIt is absolutely amazing.\n\n+ Unlike other strategy games a soldier firing a rifle at a tank doesn't do any damage. Yes, absolutely zero damage. Which is reassuring to say the least.","January 4","true","264.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game has an immense variety of ways to play from the campaigns, to theatre of war, to competitive multiplayer. You can also experiment on different maps with different commanders which allow for different styles of play, and If you get bored of the default maps you can always go on the workshop and choose from an almost endless variety of maps, mods, and win conditions.

The graphics are intensely beautiful when put to Maximum Settings. The explosions look realistic and captivating. The armor of all the units look very authentic. The maps have beautiful textures. Just like how Company of Heroes 1 was marvelous to the eye, Company of Heroes 2 provides the same role as one of the best looking Strategy games out there.\n\nFirst of all, you need to give Relic slack for even making a sequel to their videogame. These guys were completely bankrupt by THQ, who sold them to Sega. Relic suffered through some serious financial problems, but loe and behold, they had the heart to make the next greatest game. They couldn't do everything they wanted to do, nor did they have the funds to tweak the game to the point where the community wouldn't be upset. So please, if you feel that the game is rusty, give them some time.\n\nBy now, if you're reading this. The game is already near perfection. The old days of overpowered units are over, and Relic is continuously, month after month, providing game changing balance tweaks and completely new content. I anticipate every month that they provide us with whole new maps, new units, new commanders, and balance tweaks.\n\nIf you guys got bored of this game in the past, please give it another shot. And for the people who are skeptical about buying this game, this game is totally worth it!\n\nIt's Relic, they made arguably the greatest strategy game of all time, and they are bound to do it again!\n\nAnd by the way... Metascore lies. That 80 point Metascore only considers Company of Heroes 2 at day 1 of release, not where it is now. It is a completely different game from what it used to be.","August 9, 2013","true","052.3"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","21","38","0","0"

An Army colonel – his old commanding officer – interrogates him about his experiences during the war.\n\nNow onto the gameplay...\nThis game does have repetitive features from the original Company of Heroes BUT, it also adds alot of new features as well, for example the addition of your men freezing to death if you don't make them go near a campfire or shelter for too long. Firefights in the game do get rather intense but as I said, quite repetitive from the original COH.\n\nSoldier: Comrades we must push forward through the blizzard because our Commander forced us to, it's for the best tovarisch. URA!\n\nYeah sure the new features are new and creative, however the thing that bugged me was some of the missions were...unorthadox. Like burning Russian villages with RUSSIANS INSIDE THEM.\n\nSoldier: HAHA, BURN, BURN FASCIST PIGS! HAHAHAHHA....Hehe....Eeeehhh sh*t.\n\nI'm not sure where Relic gets these 'historical facts' from, but it sounds like they pulled it out of their asses.\n\nLets not forget the beginning of the game during the tutorial mission, where at the end you're shown a cinematic of a Russian commander ordering a machinegunner to execute retreating Russian soldiers.\n\nClap Clap Clap Clap\n\nGeez, you could've jsut sacked them or make them go into disciplinary action. But yeah you could just do this:\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/b7b2da0279b6d544af17a60f86acaa3e.gif\n\n\n\nNow the part that everyone loves, the ☭ Final Verdict ☭\n\nApart from all the repetitive features that Relic just happened to slap on and call it a new one.\nCompany of Heroes 2 does not lose its touch on fun RTS and commanding forces from either Allied or Axis troops.\n\nPositives:\n+Intense firefights\n+Excellent storyline\n+Graphics are decent (depending on what computer you have)\n+Adds new features that the original lacked\n\nNegatives:\n-Repetitive features from the original COH\n-Adds a bunch of DLC packs which are almost worthless\n-Great History .-.\n\nI rate this game a 7/10\nIt's an OK RTS game, however as I said, unorthadox.","May 6, 2014","true","140.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Now that the game has passed release stage and got decent as it gets patches when needed i reach to the conclusion, as i left it from time to time to see how it evolves in the long term as i had it from day 1, it has many elements of what demanding rts players will wish and its so well made to play that wont frustrate any player inthe scale of casual to experienced. Factions are getting increased in number and they have unique ways each, the game doesnt get boring at all and gets add ons when needed and these add ons are well made. The dlc are reasonable and not overated and think of that, when you go to a cafe you waste money on a drink that ends so fast and its not real good so why get mad about dlc existence ?Many blame this game be pay to win but it isnt at all, the "good commanders" are availiable by default as common item commanders, the dlc commanders are for noobs and you can get them as loot after multiplayer games. Also you dont have to buy all games to play, you can just buy 1 faction that you like to play multiplayert which is very cheap for such a GREAT GREAT game. MUST buy.","July 8, 2013","true","189.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I would recommand to buy it on sale since it's a few years old, but I would definitely buy it full price even in 2016. Amazing game. Great campaign mode, CoH part one already has an awsome campaign and CoH2 follows in those footsteps. The game is graphic a lot better than part one, also there are a lot more units. Multiplayer is also awsome, really fun. You have to constantly capture and secure points, the balance of battle can shift a lot in one single game. That keeps it always interesting if you play AI (apart from easy) or players of your own caliber. You have to micromanage a lot of units, that can be a bit difficult at first but you will get use to that pretty soon. I would suggest buying a clompete pack, so you can play all factions in multiplayer mode.","February 18","true","96.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Great game, Great moments, Great community. Has one of the best campaigns I've played, minus two of the missions which aren't my type of mission. Stealth and Strategy doesnt go hand in hand. It does put both sides (axis and allies) in a bad light, but it's war, both sides did terrible stuff. But it also shows heroes, and you create the heroes in the campaign, why else would you have to capture a tiger tank with infantry?\n\nTOW (Theater of War) is also a great new thing for the game, and really adds to the CO-OP side of the game. some missions even allow 3vsAI which is cool. TOW also lets you play on both sides (DLC doesnt, Case Blue is german side while Victory at Stalingrad is Soviet) So you can say there is a german campaign aswell, and it can be played in coop mode.\n\nMP (Multiplayer) is also quite fun, I havent played much multiplayer myself, but playing with friends against the AI is so much fun, and that is what have kept me playing.\nthe DLC is great, despite some of it being overpriced its worth it. And thank you Relic for sometimes giving the community some free DLC.\n\nTWFA (The Western Front Armies)\nIs also great, even though I've only spend about 10 hours I can already say that the expansion is worth the money. The Oberkommando West is not like the other factions and really shows germany's economy problems at the end of 1944 with high priced vehicles, and resources being more valuable, but also gives us some of the heavy armor we've all been waiting for in a game, who would of have thought that we would see a Halftrack with infrared lights?\n\nThe U.S Forces are great too! really gives us some new toys, That we didn't see in the first game, and the ability to de-crew vehicles on command, that really leads to some interesting tactics, the downside is playing with the AI and seeing it steal your decrewed vehicle... Maybe you shouldnt let the AI get too close with their own vehicle crews?\n\nAA (Ardennes Assault)\nDont' buy this campaign if you're not a SP player or intend to only play it once.\nThe campaign itself is broing, not much of a challenge. There is no strategy to the metamap. All you have to do is walk around the map with any company and win the mission. It doesnt matter whether your company is cut off or anything, you can do as you please. The enemy does also not get any penalties once you cut them from a supply line. The missions themselves are also not that great, most of them are regular Victory Point games, so just go play skirmish as USF? They try to make these missions more interesting by adding in special handicaps, so you can be so unlocky you have to wait for 5 minutes for resources, again boring. The descriptions of the missions are also very misleading, they make the mission look way harder than they are. They do also make it look like some of the missions are timed, eventhough they aren't. You can play the campaign three times, if you have all 4 companies, before you'll start to find it very boring.\n\nThe downside of the game is the war spoils (something like that), it works like the Team Fortress 2 drop system, only worse, I guess its bugged. But other than that its a great game, great graphics and great performance, mostly, sometimes delays appear when giving a unit an order.","June 22, 2013","true","798.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/findex/recommended/231430/","findex","El Cappuccino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/findex/","352 products in account","This game has the steepest learning curve in recent memory. I've played tons of rts games including many hours on the original Company of Heroes and this game's difficulty is by far the hardest of any that I've played. On Normal difficulty (the one I'm assuming that most people will start on) the difficulty is far beyond that of any rts I can think of, this isn't a criticism of the gameplay mechanics or the AI's intelligence both of which are very good, the normal AI is simply too hard for most people who'd be new to the game or even those who are experienced in the genre. The AI even on normal is ruthless and plays with a remarkable degree of skill and utilisation of the game elements, often flanking, providing diversions and usings all elements of the game mechanics, and while this is a great display of the game's AI most players aren't going to be good enough to face off against the normal AI for sometime. While some people might say "play the Easy AI instead then move up", this isn't a viable option as the easy AI is borderline braindead, providing little to no challenge what so ever, and I'd imagine that people would learn little from playing against it for prolonged periods of time. To make myself clear, I'm not criticising the game for being hard, I'm criticising it for being very unwelcoming for many new or casual players.\nLike many rts games, the campaign isn't worth glancing at, a very linear scripted and generic line up awaits, not worth your time. This game's campaign gets a lot of criticism (wrongly so) from the portrayal of the Soviets, as bloodthirsty and cruel but apparently many people have never read a history book.","December 22, 2013","false","4.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Every match is a unique one, every general is a unique one, everyone has a choice of their way to play\n\nCons:\n\nPrice is expensive?            (wait for a promotional sale event, the ingame goodies are free and will drop from air)\n\nBalancing issues?              (all units can be countered by another unit,  skill matters over trivial complain on balance)\n\nServer issues?                    (seems to be it depends on the host's PC power, update comes once 3 months to address issues)\n\nThis is a review from an experienced RTS player. (StarCraft 2, Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires 3 Collection, Command and Conquer Ultimate Collection)\n\nIf you love strategy and team work,  this is one of the finest WWII RTS ever made!\n\n","September 20, 2015","true","531.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

In the first case, everything that was wrong with USSR was admitted by Russians in an awful lot of books and studies. It's all up for you to read. Largely explained, with many photos of those times. If you wish to explore it quicker, you can watch some documentaries on this topic. Most of which are made by Russians, by the way. Nobody else is as interested in rooting into WW2 as Russian people. This war took a lot of their lives. They took the hardest punch, went through it hand to hand with Allies and regular people, like you and me. Everyone was united by a cause Germans would never figure out. To defend their kind. Germans had a little..different ideals.\n\nWhat Relic did with Company of Heroes 2 is called defamation.\n\nBeing Polish, you should probably know the term very well. (referring the guy in the comments section)\n\nSo what Relic does is not only show us the 'dark face' as you might say, but instead of making an incredible story of a horrible event they make a propaganda-fueled movie in style of US movies of 1960. The 'bad commie' type of film.\n\nThere is a huge difference between narrated storytelling based on proven facts with a huge pile of evidence, and making this crap.\n\nI love history. I love reading books, finding rare videos of those times, looking at old and exquisite photographs that might seem uninteresting to most people. Photos of regular people standing united by a cause. And no, I don't mean Nazis in this case. I'd say they were more divided in ideology than anyone.\n\nBut I hate it when people who can manipulate masses blow the only thing they were supposed to do - tell the facts, and make them seem real. The drama, the horror of World War 2 should be in place. A mother burrying her own son, a man dying on arms of his fellow friends, children preparing for what they are going to face, people hearing the sirens, looking at the skies and knowing what is going to follow. All of this should be put in place.\n\nThe war was fought by the real people. The real people died in this war, not those plastic figures for whom the only reason to fight is so they won't be punished by the command.\n(As shown by Relic)\n\nPopular magazines who reviewed the game with scores of 8 and higher were probably paid to skip the campaign and rate multiplayer only, which didn't change much. I love the snow blizzard, but that's it. New units and tons of paid DLCs don't make a game. Well they didn't some time ago, now it's considered a really nice effort.\n\nUnfortunately, German propaganda worked too well, as Werner Naumann pointed out. It ricocheted against their own people, made their troops lose the war, but it works pretty well nowadays. For the most of people, that is. Like the Polish guy from comments below. Too many people are sheep who don't believe in things other than 'bad' or 'good'.\n\nWhen people grow up they start wondering if there is really black and white, or is there something beyond? If the time isn't right for you, if you just stopped playing Call of Duty with your 12-year-old fifth grade classmates, buy this game and enjoy the campaign to the fullest. You'll love it.","December 25, 2013","false","2.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","6"

If you wish to explore it quicker, you can watch some documentaries on this topic. Most of which are made by Russians, by the way. Nobody else is as interested in rooting into WW2 as Russian people. This war took a lot of their lives. They took the hardest punch, went through it hand to hand with Allies and regular people, like you and me. Everyone was united by a cause Germans would never figure out. To defend their kind. Germans had a little..different ideals.\n\nWhat Relic did with Company of Heroes 2 is called defamation.\n\nBeing Polish, you should probably know the term very well. (referring the guy in the comments section)\n\nSo what Relic does is not only show us the 'dark face' as you might say, but instead of making an incredible story of a horrible event they make a propaganda-fueled movie in style of US movies of 1960. The 'bad commie' type of film.\n\nThere is a huge difference between narrated storytelling based on proven facts with a huge pile of evidence, and making this crap.\n\nI love history. I love reading books, finding rare videos of those times, looking at old and exquisite photographs that might seem uninteresting to most people. Photos of regular people standing united by a cause. And no, I don't mean Nazis in this case. I'd say they were more divided in ideology than anyone.\n\nBut I hate it when people who can manipulate masses blow the only thing they were supposed to do - tell the facts, and make them seem real. The drama, the horror of World War 2 should be in place. A mother burrying her own son, a man dying on arms of his fellow friends, children preparing for what they are going to face, people hearing the sirens, looking at the skies and knowing what is going to follow. All of this should be put in place.\n\nThe war was fought by the real people. The real people died in this war, not those plastic figures for whom the only reason to fight is so they won't be punished by the command.\n(As shown by Relic)\n\nPopular magazines who reviewed the game with scores of 8 and higher were probably paid to skip the campaign and rate multiplayer only, which didn't change much. I love the snow blizzard, but that's it. New units and tons of paid DLCs don't make a game. Well they didn't some time ago, now it's considered a really nice effort.\n\nUnfortunately, German propaganda worked too well, as Werner Naumann pointed out. It ricocheted against their own people, made their troops lose the war, but it works pretty well nowadays. For the most of people, that is. Like the Polish guy from comments below. Too many people are sheep who don't believe in things other than 'bad' or 'good'.\n\nWhen people grow up they start wondering if there is really black and white, or is there something beyond? If the time isn't right for you, if you just stopped playing Call of Duty with your 12-year-old fifth grade classmates, buy this game and enjoy the campaign to the fullest. You'll love it.","December 25, 2013","false","2.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","6"

Having played some games in COH2 now, with regret, and no little disappointment - I find I hate this. Utterly spolied by the brilliance of COH1 and add ons and mods, I go in here, and find some cartoony version. The bleak eastern front is some disney coloured horror. The game for starters is too damn zoomed in. It needs at least an ability to zoom 30% more out from the battle field.\n\nThey clearly kept too much Dawn of war involvement in this production. The game needs severe toning down on the silly over use of cartoon like colour. A better zoom. Even with this, so far, I've just not enjoyed it. I'll try some more, but everything is pop ups, and garish colours, and its missing a lot of feel from COH. Even the simple stuff like the map in the left bottom corner is just worse than COH, with more difficulty in simply map marking and so on.\n\nIf you have none of these, really consider getting COH 1 and its add ons. I can't recommend COH2 at this time..","December 28, 2013","false","12.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

COH1 is still a far better game with regards to gameplay, balance, and personally I would also say graphics.  Yes COH2 has more map detail but big deal, it only slows down the already sluggish gameplay.  COH2 is stacked very heavily towards the germans, and you see this by the number of players who play axis VS allies in MP.  I typically play the soviets for something different, but it's frustrating while battling OP stacked german teams.  Also for those that complain about DLC, you don't need upgrades to win, but for a game that's already poorly balanced its one more thing that can tip the scales in favor of the other team.","February 15, 2015","false","221.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

The graphics are very detailed, the sound is excellent, the combat intense and the strategies required to win are never set in stone. It is a difficult game to fully grasp if you've no experience with an RTS like it, but features like destructible environments, cover, dynamic line of sight, and even things like armor facing make this an incredibly unique RTS with no equal.\n\nDon't expect this game to go easy on you - every little second and ability counts just as much as the units you pit against your enemy and your strategy on how to combat them. You must be able to multitask and micromanage very well all while understanding the dynamics between each unit. This is a game that is all about how you are able to deal with the cards you are dealt, not the kind of deck you build before the fight. In other words, its not so much about build order and timing as it is about positioning, reconnaissance, micromanagement, reactions, and being able to think on your feet. If that sounds like an interesting challenge to you, then I HIGHLY reccomend this game.","October 24, 2014","true","198.8"," 130 of 252 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","130","252","0","2"

Singleplayer and campaign is not that what makes games great but its the amazing multiplayer experience you will get.\n\n\nI give this game  10/10  TOTALLY WORTH IT :)","October 8, 2015","true","200.0"," 24 of 45 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","24","45","3","0"

As with the other relic games, I only bought it because of the multiplayer, never tried the singleplayer, and was always a great fan of relic games. They always were my bread and butter. Problem with this game is the balancing and I'm not talking of the balance between factions - they are currently almost equally strong - but the balance between different kinds of units. In the current version infantry and medium tanks are way overpowered, so everybody is just spamming infantry and medium tanks. Most units became useless and are rarely used and everybody plays the same strategies. You will see blobs in every game. Its only about blobs, takes all the fun out for me. People mass riflemen, volks etc until they have a massive blob, then late game they spam shermans, t34/85 etc. 90% of americans play the same commander to spam E8. With commanders it's the same as with units, everybody plays the same few commanders all the time, most are never used, because they are unbalanced. I can't blame the players, the game forces you to spam and rewards spamming. If you don't adapt and abuse the same ♥♥♥♥ you will have a hard time, makes the game very repetetive. I enjoyed their previous games especially because you had to mix many different unit types to be succesful and it enabled many different strategies, but in CoH 2 there are only very few possible army compositions if you want to play effective. I had a lot of patience (as you can see I played over 1000h), because I understand that balancing is a difficult issue, but balance will never get fixed, it rather gets worse. They keep adding more factions and commanders and apparently that makes it too difficult to balance the game. On top of that the new warspoil system is totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and SEGA is milking customers with DLC in a very obscene manner. The community is also very immature and consists mainly of people who blame their allies, bugs and luck if they loose - crying, raging and dropping - but offend you in ridiculous ways if they manage to win. All that totally destroys this game, which could have been a great experience.","March 21, 2015","false","150.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Each faction is very unique and requiters getting familiar with and a specific approach. You could be good with Germans but suck with the Russians.

COH simply had 2 expansions, Opposing Fronts and Tales of Valor which your could have bought with the base game for $100 MSRP, at release.\n\nCOH2 has no less than 6, as well as dozens of DLC commanders and skins. The base game with minor expansions cost around $140, and the commanders would cost you nearly as much if you wanted them all. The skins I can forgive as they are cosmetic, but the commanders introduce new units and capabilities that ABSOLUTELY RUIN THE MULTIPLAYER.\n\nTake the Soviet Industry Tactics commander for instance, that gives you the capability to slam out T-70s and T-34s out so quick, the enemy barely has time to deploy AT guns. Or the Elite Troops Doctrine, that allows you to pay for veterancy in troops, as well as a Tiger Ace. Do you want the have the ability to use this against your opponents? You've got to pay extra, of course!\n\nThis simply is unnacceptable, and I can't recommend anyone pay for such a shameful pay-2-win scheme.\n\nNow, with my gripe out of the way;\n\nCOH2 has a great Soviet single player campaign, and the Ardennes Assault campaign is fun, although it has less personality being somewhat more freeform. I enjoyed all the missions from Case Blue, but haven't tried Victory at Stalingrad or Southern Fronts.\n\nI really, really, really wish they'd had a German compaign like in COH's Opposing Fronts. It was a favorite of mine, as well as the British Campaign. The fact that COH2 doesn't have anything more than a Soviet Campaign and American campaign in the style of Warhammer DOW Black Crusade is dissapointing. The Brits, Ostheer and Oberkommado West are completely left behind.\n\nAs for the multiplayer, it's solid and fun. It allows for only 2 game modes, Victory Points and Annihilation, but games are typically fierce and fair. As long as you can ignore the unfair DLC commanders, you'll enjoy it.\n\nOverall, COH2 is a great game, but flawed by SEGA, an evil DLC loving publisher. It makes me sad that Relic fell under their corrupting and vile influence, but at least their games are still mostly intact. Without the disgusting DLC commanders, I'd give the game a 8.5-9.0 out of 10. However, with the current dispicable DLC situation, it's only a 7.5. Still a recommended game, and one of the best of the modern RTS games, but dissapointing for afformentioned reasons.","January 23","true","252.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

For me, as an Example, I got more than 20 Commanders in 200~ hours, many other Items & Skins.\n\nCoH2 will be my next Turn after Years of CoH1 just because there is a Workshop for new Maps.

Google Starcraft 1 or 2, both of them are the only real balanced RTS after Years of E-Sport-Merch and a bunch of Workers. Even Age 2 isnt balanced. Gamebalancing needs two Things: Money and Workers. CoH 2 isnt that balanced & in my opinion it will never be.

The cover mechanic and how you need to use AT weapons against armored targets to be able to take them down is awesome! Play the pretty OKAY campaign with terrible voiceacting and do some skirmishes against the AI and your friends.\nWith five diffrent armies with diffrent playstyles, you will surely find one that suits you and your style.\n\nNot a campaign or skirmish fan? Well then you're in luck my friend. There is a type of challenge mode in this game called the "Theatre of War" which is basicly recycled maps from the skirmish with diffrent objectives to fullfill apart from destroying your enemies base or capturing points.\n\nWhy you should NOT get this game\nLike multiplayer? Like to play ranked? Want to take your army and battle it out all over the world against players thirsting for a fight? Yeah? Well you'll not find what you're looking for in this game.\n\nWhy? Because the "Elo+" ranking system is ♥♥♥♥ed beyond repair in this one, oh boy let me tell you. Either you'll get a game, and get so stomped in to the ground that you'll have to buy a new keyboard each damn match. Or you'll stomp them so much that THEY'LL have to get a new keyboard efter that match.\n\nThe matchmaking is totally ♥♥♥♥ed ladies and gentlemen, there is no middle ground here, especially if you're new to the game.\n\nYou can argue that "Well, if you continue you'll get good at it". And yes, that is true as skills comes with practice, but when every match is almost 30-60 minutes long and you already from the start can't get a foothold on any important points, it's not fun to learn.\n\nAlso, practicing in skirmish with AI is a good way to learn the game aswell but the AI's tactics are so far from tactics of real people that you can't take what you've learned with you apart from what every unit do and maybe what type of commander you like.\n\nTL'DR\nRelic needs to fix the matchmaking for the multiplayer to be enjoyable as a solo player. Other than that, it's a solid game.","February 4","true","55.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Let be straight on this! This game is not better then Company of heroes 1. Company of heroes 2 is a good game but dont live to the legacy from the first game. Company of heroes 2 when it came out felt like the game is unfinish, with only 2 armys, some maps and some tweeks in the gameplay. They realase the game unfinish for you next buy loads of DLCs to complete the game. Its kinda like the sims 3 with the sims 4, you have sims 3 completed with all can you imagina and next they launch sims 4 unfinish for next lanch a bunch of DLCs to complete game. Company of heroes 2 is the same thing. This game still Company of heroes but misses lot of stuff from the first game. The gameplay is identical with some tweeks, 2 armays and new maps. What i hated about this game is the m,ain game only have 2 annoying armys for you listen all the time! Its germans and russians, always speak russian and german all the time... You cant understand nothing. This game is also hard and the friendly IA somethings is really dumb can make you really angry lol. But overall the game is good but not as good as the first one. If you like the first one you will like this one. But be aware this game needs a lots of DLCs for you enjoy it a lot! Because you get stuck only with main game you will get bored like hell... And listen that russian?

COH simply had 2 expansions, Opposing Fronts and Tales of Valor which your could have bought with the base game for $100 MSRP, at release.\n\nCOH2 has no less than 6, as well as dozens of DLC commanders and skins. The base game with minor expansions cost around $140, and the commanders would cost you nearly as much if you wanted them all. The skins I can forgive as they are cosmetic, but the commanders introduce new units and capabilities that ABSOLUTELY RUIN THE MULTIPLAYER.\n\nTake the Soviet Industry Tactics commander for instance, that gives you the capability to slam out T-70s and T-34s out so quick, the enemy barely has time to deploy AT guns. Or the Elite Troops Doctrine, that allows you to pay for veterancy in troops, as well as a Tiger Ace. Do you want the have the ability to use this against your opponents? You've got to pay extra, of course!\n\nThis simply is unnacceptable, and I can't recommend anyone pay for such a shameful pay-2-win scheme.\n\nNow, with my gripe out of the way;\n\nCOH2 has a great Soviet single player campaign, and the Ardennes Assault campaign is fun, although it has less personality being somewhat more freeform. I enjoyed all the missions from Case Blue, but haven't tried Victory at Stalingrad or Southern Fronts.\n\nI really, really, really wish they'd had a German compaign like in COH's Opposing Fronts. It was a favorite of mine, as well as the British Campaign. The fact that COH2 doesn't have anything more than a Soviet Campaign and American campaign in the style of Warhammer DOW Black Crusade is dissapointing. The Brits, Ostheer and Oberkommado West are completely left behind.\n\nAs for the multiplayer, it's solid and fun. It allows for only 2 game modes, Victory Points and Annihilation, but games are typically fierce and fair. As long as you can ignore the unfair DLC commanders, you'll enjoy it.\n\nOverall, COH2 is a great game, but flawed by SEGA, an evil DLC loving publisher. It makes me sad that Relic fell under their corrupting and vile influence, but at least their games are still mostly intact. Without the disgusting DLC commanders, I'd give the game a 8.5-9.0 out of 10. However, with the current dispicable DLC situation, it's only a 7.5. Still a recommended game, and one of the best of the modern RTS games, but dissapointing for afformentioned reasons.","January 23","true","252.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

For me, as an Example, I got more than 20 Commanders in 200~ hours, many other Items & Skins.\n\nCoH2 will be my next Turn after Years of CoH1 just because there is a Workshop for new Maps.

Google Starcraft 1 or 2, both of them are the only real balanced RTS after Years of E-Sport-Merch and a bunch of Workers. Even Age 2 isnt balanced. Gamebalancing needs two Things: Money and Workers. CoH 2 isnt that balanced & in my opinion it will never be.

The cover mechanic and how you need to use AT weapons against armored targets to be able to take them down is awesome! Play the pretty OKAY campaign with terrible voiceacting and do some skirmishes against the AI and your friends.\nWith five diffrent armies with diffrent playstyles, you will surely find one that suits you and your style.\n\nNot a campaign or skirmish fan? Well then you're in luck my friend. There is a type of challenge mode in this game called the "Theatre of War" which is basicly recycled maps from the skirmish with diffrent objectives to fullfill apart from destroying your enemies base or capturing points.\n\nWhy you should NOT get this game\nLike multiplayer? Like to play ranked? Want to take your army and battle it out all over the world against players thirsting for a fight? Yeah? Well you'll not find what you're looking for in this game.\n\nWhy? Because the "Elo+" ranking system is ♥♥♥♥ed beyond repair in this one, oh boy let me tell you. Either you'll get a game, and get so stomped in to the ground that you'll have to buy a new keyboard each damn match. Or you'll stomp them so much that THEY'LL have to get a new keyboard efter that match.\n\nThe matchmaking is totally ♥♥♥♥ed ladies and gentlemen, there is no middle ground here, especially if you're new to the game.\n\nYou can argue that "Well, if you continue you'll get good at it". And yes, that is true as skills comes with practice, but when every match is almost 30-60 minutes long and you already from the start can't get a foothold on any important points, it's not fun to learn.\n\nAlso, practicing in skirmish with AI is a good way to learn the game aswell but the AI's tactics are so far from tactics of real people that you can't take what you've learned with you apart from what every unit do and maybe what type of commander you like.\n\nTL'DR\nRelic needs to fix the matchmaking for the multiplayer to be enjoyable as a solo player. Other than that, it's a solid game.","February 4","true","55.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Again, don't mind reviews from sour losers.\nThe campaign here sucks! it really does! Full of clichés and not educational by no means. The multiplayer is awesome though. Also, the Theater of war installments are great as well.","February 23","true","429.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It always has a fun challenge even against the bots. Sure there are DLC's for different armies but they are worth the money! This game is worth the money because you will always be facing a new challenge in a beutiful map with cool vehicles and amazing game mechanics! I myself love to use the artillery to set the mood then I charge in with my troops and tanks to begin the epic fight.\n\nAlso with the steam workshop you can download or create awesome skins to use or spread out. Compared to the first CoH games this game is about the same in graphics. (improved in CoH2) The only downside I'd say is that you need a good computer to let the game show it's full graphical potential but luckily there are some good settings yo save your ♥♥♥ on the FPS. Company of Heroes has been my faviorite game since the first one and god am I not dissapointed in this game.

account","EXPLAINING MYSELF\nBefore I start my review,I will say that I played the first Company of Heroes with all its expansion packs(Opposing Fronts and Tales of Valor) and that I had a rather enjoyable experience.The factions were diverse and unique and the campaign had some challenge in it.The multiplayer was the epitome of multiplayer strategy.\n\nONE OF THESE THINGS IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER\nSo,what does Company of Heroes 2 offer that its predecessor doesn't?Well,the setting is different.Eastern front in the center of the game,therefore Ostheer(East German army) and the Soviet Red Army are the available factions to play as.The Germans have smaller squads but are generally superior in equipment and training(e.g.the Panzergrenadiers can be upgraded with Panzershreck to eliminate armor,none of the Soviet infantry has any upgrade to do so).The Soviets have larger squads,which gives them better chances to survive and reinforce(except the Engineers who have 4 and Sniper team who has 2,the rest of the Soviet squads have 6 men).\n\nNICE,BUT HOW DO YOU PLAY IT?\nThe gameplay is the same as in the last game;capture point to get resorces and don't let the territories get cut off from your main base.However,instead of some points offering munitions,fuel or manpower, most points offer both munitions and fuel(in a smaller amount) with some offering just fuel or munitions but in a higher amount.Those that offer both may be secured to either increase their munitions or fuel output(but not both).Tactics such as taking cover,flanking,suppressing and vehicle positioning are important to win battles,since a heavy tank can be defeated if engaged with a AT gun while the bazooka team flanks and attacks his weak back armor.Overall,it's the same game,but...\n\nLET IT SNOW\nThe snow ain't just for aesthetic purposes.Heavy snow can slow down both infantry and vehicles,and in some situations your men will freeze to death if they are not in a building,vehicle or near a fireplace.Blizzarrds may occur at random(you will get a warning and a timer telling you how much is left before it hits).It lowers the sight range of all your units,while freezing the men,forcing you to take care of them.Vehicles and men leave marks on the snow so you know if someone passed there and where he went.\n\nYURI,WHAT DO YOUR BLUE EYES SEE?\nTue line of sight is implemented in this game.In simple terms,your units cannot see behind walls or through trees,making ambushes a potent tactical solution(the first game didn't have true line of sight).It is a very fun mechanic that I haven't seen since the games of Stormregion(Codename:Panzers and Rush for Berlin).It makes scouting a neccessary maneuver to your strategy and smoke screens a life saver from artillery and machineguns(my Soviet Shock troops saved a lot of my men with their smoke grenades).An excellent addition to the game.LOVE IT!\n\nWANT TO GO TO A THEATER?\nTheater of War is and addition to the singleplayer portion of the game.You have solo challenges and coop scenarios.These can vary from officer assasination,holding a position,eliminating a armoured column during the blizzard and so on.It extends the life of the game and if you have a friend,some of the scenarios you can play with him.\n\nCOMPANY OF FUN\nThe multiplayer is so fun I don't know what words to use.It's immersive and action packed,but smart action.You need to make decisions fast and smart to win.The user interface really helps here;on the bottor right you can select the production buildings,set a rally point and order a unit to arrive.this is important in the early stages of the game,when deployment to the frontline is crucial.The various maps also help in this,considering that they are different in sizer and terrain.\n\nSINGLE IS COLD\nI played the first three missions of the campaign and didn't continue because I ran out of time(I played this during the free weekend action).The campaign is inferior to that from CoH1.Whil CoH1 displayed the Americans,British and Germans as normal people doing their duty,the Soviet army men are portrayed as cowards who shoot their own men in the back.True,attrocities were made by the Red Army and the methods they used were brutal,but htere must have been some heroic moments.Sadly,the campaign doesn't show that,and the way the story is presented doesn't help.It is told via a flashback,which makes it feel detached from reality.Add in that the focus is on the bad side of the Red Army(and that the Germans are nothing more than obstacle,rather that a force),while showing nothing bad about the German army(they did attrocities,no army is safe from that) adn you get and rather empty and almost surreal story that is hard to believe or take serious.\n\nCOMRADE,WHAT IS THE CONCLUSION?\nCompany of Heroes 2 is an excellent strategy with excellent multiplayed balancing,a sizeable singleplayer content and a dull campaign story.If you're buying it for the multiplayer,you won't be dissapointed.If you're buying it for the challenges,missions and scenarios in th Theater of War you will get a kick from it.If you're buying it for and interesting story then you will get dissapointed with it.\n\n","October 20, 2014","true","538.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The grapics are great and with new maps coming out of the workshop daily there is endless fun. However I do not think much time was put into unit development or the addition of new units with DLC's. All factions could use additional units to add variety to gameplay. And I based on significant gameplay time, the map you play on in single player, placement of teams can greatly decide which team wins.

Sigue una linea propia que no se ve en otros juegos. El nivel gráfico somo siempre es superior a muchos otros ademas de su jugabilidad, tambien creo que han avanzado mucho en lo que es la inmersión en el combate, es mucho mas realista, mas brutal. Aunque por supuesto tiene sus cosas malas, al menos para mi. EN primer lugar decepcionado con el sistema de DLCs, me parece una salvajada que pagando 50 euros por el juego, venga ala mitad, ya que si quieres camuflajes o comandantes los tienes que comprar, para tener el juego completo a parte de los 50 euritos que ya has pagado deberias abonar otros 54 euros en dlcs, en definitiva una sajada. Tambien como siempre, pàra mi gusto hay poca variedad de unidades, en la segunda guerra mundial habia muchisima variedad de vehiculos y de unidades, no digo de poner 200 unidades diferentes por bando, pero se echa en falta por ejemplo algo de artilleria autopropulsada, algunos tanques, y por supuesto la pieza antitanque de 88 mm tan famosa. Tambien echo en falta algo mas de personalización, creo que se podria avanzar mas en ese aspecto aunqeu bueno poco a poco. Un modo solo infanteria tampoco estaria mal.\nEn definitiva a pesar de los defectos, si es un juego que recomiendo, aunque le qeuda un largo recorrido de trabajo.\n\nUn saludo a todos.","July 18, 2013","true","531.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Though it is similar by virture of genre and setting; It's not merely a sequel! It's a whole new interactive gameplay--from units to maps to missions. The basic game commanders as totally adequate for adding a lot of variety (which vCOH had only 3 choices) via the commanders. Buying the DLC just enhances the options though in few cases adds newer units or abilities. Personally, I like this--buy it if you want it approach.\n\nCOH2 deliveres a lot a fun, tense gameplay. Truesight, weather tech, and new infantry pathing abilities, along with a dynamically changing battlefield, really creates some great gaming. (Oh, vehicle pathing is still somewhat spastic.)\n\nThe asymetrical balance is somewhat daunting to learn (much like the Brits once nerfed), with the Wehrmacht being most similar to vCOH. Here the game made some subtle differences that makes the Wehrmacht somewhat easier to manage (without micro-managing). The Soviets, however, are fun but exasperating to play (to some degree like the Americans in vCOH). Soviet teching is not at all linear or even possible in many matches, given the massive bleeding inflicted by losses. Yet, once you've learned what combination of Soviet arms to cobble together, the Soviets really give the Wehrmacht a run for their money. Ultimately, a Soviet player has to be far more descriminating and anticipatory in what units to produce than the Wehrmact, since an early Panzer or Ostwind can ruin an otherwise good game.  Likewise, the stronger Wehrmacht tanks can't afford to get ahead of infantry support. Hence, Soviets arms typically dominate the Wehrmacht infantry, whereas the Wehrmacht tanks can outlast most Soviet armor. It's a truly asymetrical theater.\n\nCOH2 is a great game. Sequel-like but not a sequel. It's got numerous improvements (and differences....even when vCOH had some better aspects) that make COH, well, a bit old.\n\nCost of the buy-in is definitely higher; but the fun factor (for me) is worth it! Bigger than that, is the hardware requirements to run this graphic hog. But if you've got the gaming system that can run it, I'd recommend that you try it. It's not a FPS, but it's an awesome RTS.","January 7, 2014","true","473.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Relic has managed to completely ignore the aspects that made CoH 1 a really great RTS game, like command trees, good micro/macro balance etc. Instead they made a DLC heavy "pay to win" with shiny graphics. Recognize the concept from Dawn of War series? Booyeah!\n\nIs CoH 2 better than it's predecessor in gameplay? No. It only looks prettier (if you have a top of the line PC that is...) and is more expensive. Even though it's super cool when I can zoom in to see the wrinkles on my Conscripts uniforms it does not in any way compensate for bad gameplay, only micro and no macro, lousy pathfinding and a frame rate of 20 fps. The only real improvement from the first game is the option to choose grid layout for key shortcuts. To get good stats for your units you also need to grind grind grind xp to level up certain abilities. Yuck. I tried to give the game an honest chance after the initial disappointment, but I could not take more than 4 hours of this crap.\n\nSo a recommendation to you all: get the good old CoH 1 with expansions and download some of the excellent mods out there, like Blitzkrieg, Eastern Front etc and get down to some serious WW2 strategy! :)","February 15, 2014","false","4.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Other DLC for extra scenarios seems a bit overpriced as well. As far as I'm concerned I will not be buying any DLC until it goes on sale, even then I'll think twice about it. As for the main game it never seems like you have enough manpower either stockpiled or flowing in. AI battles on harder settings feel as though they have an infinite amount of resources while you are struggling just to send throw away units to keep them at bay long enough to call in bigger units. This game definitely needs some balancing tweeks. With the overpriced DLC I would suggest only getting this game if you plan on playing by yourself most of the time.

This has become the biggest hinderance for me to love this game further.  Microtransactions should be fine, but when it messes into the tip of balanced play, gonna need to say good bye to competitive multiplayer.  A game like this will never match its predecessor which was epic.  Keeping balance in-check is tremendously difficult if they keep adding new units like four or five times a year.  This game is far as into only a shadow to the original, or compared to Starcraft in term of multiplayer play.\n\nI did only spent by 200+ hours enjoyable when there wasn't P2W (Pay to win) commander in play.  When there was very few commanders available. Please note that metacritic score of 80 were granted at the time of the game released, but as the time comes, users score has only booked an abysmal 1.6 (overwhelming dislike) due to its DLCs.\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/company-of-heroes-2\n\nWhy are they bother much on Microtransactions?  Greed? the original price point of this game is already that high.  Worshiper fans would even buy the collector edition, which only gets them what?  think of it.  Even those collector edition players are still faced with the microtransactions.  The player level and bulletin? Its lookslike to be too unfair and further mess with balance twists, as well as too marginal benefit at the same time.

However, the first one is still much better. Below are the reasons why:\n\n1. In-game microtransactions (HATE THESE)\n2. Unlocks for your army. This means that more experienced players have an even greater advantage. Absolutely no reason why these are necessary - make every fight fair, regardless of player "level"\n3. Weather system is really the only change, and is more annoying than anything. Having your troops freeze to death because they chase an enemy 5 feet from the fire and can't find their way back sucks.\n4. Only 2 armies, compared to the 4 in the original game.\n5. Duplicates many of the maps from the original.\n\nHonestly, save yourself the money and just go play the first one again. Nothing (and I mean virtually nothing) has changed for this version. It feels more like an expansion than a sequel.

Until CoH 2 came along and they tried to make it look better in terms of graphics and gameplay but it wasnt enough. Graphics wise, its good. But the logic is terrable. For example: Lets say 1 enemy squad is firing at your squad, and they are like 10 feet away. They will miss almost every shot and it takes LONGER to kill that squad in long range than close combats. It was a very old issue but noooo, lets make battles longer to extend the time for each match. Instead of having smaller army cap, why not increase it and make battles more realistic. The campaign was nice, wish you can kill enemy squads in multiplayer like the campaign mode. Not much content. You only have like 3 modes, Single player, Multiplayer and Challenges. You have to buy new maps, which is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because THQ never makes you pay for maps on their games and COH1 was all free, most likely its SEGA making money. If you never played RTS games or COH, dont buy this game. Not saying its ♥♥♥♥, its actually alright but not worth the money now (59$, 49$, 39$).\n\nAlso one more big point, the maps are garbage, its like a 10 year old kid made it for fun. No wonder this game doesnt have eSport. Base building is ♥♥♥♥, I want this to stop, its like Dawn Of war 2 where u only put like 4 buildings and all you do is upgrade them.\n\nEdit: Even the new challanges you have to buy, but atleast they put Steam Workshop which makes the game much better. The new Western DLC is totally worth it, unique teams and I love playing them.","February 13, 2014","false","124.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Weather, Cover, Ressources Management, Strategy and: Lots of Tactics.\n\nTheres a lot of Commanders to Start with, you can choose three of them to take them into Battle, then you choose from one of those three on the Field.\n\nEach Army has a lot of Units to use, so without even choosing a Doctrine (Commander) you have a lot of diversity to play against your oppononent. With your choosen Commander, you even get more specialised Units, to make your Army better for your Strategy. But none of this really matters, if you dont use your tactical advantages. In the end, its all about micromanaging your troops, to lure your opponent in traps, flanking him, whatever you can use, to win the game. Even if it means, to steal enemy Vehicles or Teamweapons, its all tactical decisions you got to make during the match you play.\n\nTheres a lot of complaints about the Commanders you can buy, but in the end, this Commanders are very specialised in one or another way, which means, they got a lot of disatvantages, just because theyre so specialised. So what i try to say is: Theyre useless, if you dont know how to use them right, or if your opponent knows about your disatvantages and counters you the right way.\n\nI played the first one surely for more than thousand hours, and im already played lots of hours in the second one, which in my opinion is better, because of hopping over obstacles with your troops, and the fact, that theres the truesight, which you can perfectly use to lure your enemy into traps, because the cant see whats behind the House or behind the Forest. Or even behind the Hill.\n\nBut because of all this, its a very hard Game, its still unpredictable, and no single game is like the other, its always different.\n\nOnly thing i would complain about this game is:\nThe war spoils system is very strange. You get a lot of the same Commanders and stuff all the time, but you cant give it to someone, nor can you sell them. You just own them a couple of times.\n\nSorry for my bad english :)","November 17, 2015","true","783.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I first played the beta (A LOT) then bought it, played it from time to time. I own both multiplayer expansions, and I recommend those two too, really worth the money. The sad part is that Relic is just like EA and Ubisoft, milking the cash cow. They even separated the skins and commander DLC from Steam so that you can only buy them in-game, which means they are never on Steam Sales...\n\nSo I recommend, buy the base game, if you want more, buy the MP expansions on a steam sale. BUT! Don't be surprised if Relic just randomly drops a huge patch changing the whole game and making this and that OP and something else useless. It has been like that ever since the first open beta, it has changed sooooo many times now. But I guess I have still enjoyed it enough to recommend it ^^\n\nHere are some quickbits for all you lazy asses:\n+ Graphics\n+ Gameplay, lots of variety, many maps and many units\n+ Modding, map-making etc\n\n- SEGA can go eat my s**t\n- DLC\n- More DLC\n- Even more DLC\n- Some more DLC just in case SEGA runs out of coffe-money","January 4","true","596.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

With DLC, it starts to change things up a bit. I honestly really like playing this game and right off the bat, recommend you give it a shot, now let me tell you a little bit about why.\n\n+The Graphics are astounding. The visuals during snowstorms, of any and every terrain, splendidly done.\n+The sounds are near-perfect. Just about everything sounds right. From the gunfire, to the explosions, to your poor infantry unit screaming in agony as he crawls away from his dead squadron, both of his legs blown off. Someone, PLEASE SOMEONE! Just the poor guy out of his misery already!\n+A truly immersive experience in terms of animations and "impact". Every unit you kill or injure. Every base or building you destroy, everything just feels right. It's satisfying, terrifying, and depressing, all at the same time. The game pulls off playing with your emotions without even trying.\n+The controls are done just right for every faction to play smoothly, gameplay is quality.\n-Optimized JUST poorly enough to notice unless you're packing a $2000 dollar computer.\n-No multi-GPU support. So you can't even make up for that lack of optimization.\n-A typical boring and aggravating campaign. It starts out fantastically, don't get me wrong, but as you get further in it feels like less effort was put into it. Towards the end you'll be begging for it to be over.\n-The most annoying marketing strategy I have ever seen. $40 for the game, $20 for the US and OKW (or $13 each separately). $13 for the British. And $40 for a US campaign! Not to mention $5-$10 for misc DLC. The entire game will cost you a whopping $143 full price. Stop charging us so much for extra content when you won't even optimize the content you already have.\n\nThe game's real hit game modes are its 4v4 PvP or PvE matches. Most of my 48 hours I've played upon writing this review were spent there, and I know yours will be too if you pick this game up. I give this game an 8/10. It's fantastic, but the lack of optimization and multiGPU support, plus the lackluster campaign and ABYSMAL marketing strategy knocked it down from being the best RTS I have played in a long time. I'd still recommend it however, but do yourself a favor. Unless you have money to spare, buy this on a holiday sale. Don't fall for Relic's greedy marketing strategy if you can help it.","September 4, 2015","true","71.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Weather, Cover, Ressources Management, Strategy and: Lots of Tactics.\n\nTheres a lot of Commanders to Start with, you can choose three of them to take them into Battle, then you choose from one of those three on the Field.\n\nEach Army has a lot of Units to use, so without even choosing a Doctrine (Commander) you have a lot of diversity to play against your oppononent. With your choosen Commander, you even get more specialised Units, to make your Army better for your Strategy. But none of this really matters, if you dont use your tactical advantages. In the end, its all about micromanaging your troops, to lure your opponent in traps, flanking him, whatever you can use, to win the game. Even if it means, to steal enemy Vehicles or Teamweapons, its all tactical decisions you got to make during the match you play.\n\nTheres a lot of complaints about the Commanders you can buy, but in the end, this Commanders are very specialised in one or another way, which means, they got a lot of disatvantages, just because theyre so specialised. So what i try to say is: Theyre useless, if you dont know how to use them right, or if your opponent knows about your disatvantages and counters you the right way.\n\nI played the first one surely for more than thousand hours, and im already played lots of hours in the second one, which in my opinion is better, because of hopping over obstacles with your troops, and the fact, that theres the truesight, which you can perfectly use to lure your enemy into traps, because the cant see whats behind the House or behind the Forest. Or even behind the Hill.\n\nBut because of all this, its a very hard Game, its still unpredictable, and no single game is like the other, its always different.\n\nOnly thing i would complain about this game is:\nThe war spoils system is very strange. You get a lot of the same Commanders and stuff all the time, but you cant give it to someone, nor can you sell them. You just own them a couple of times.\n\nSorry for my bad english :)","November 17, 2015","true","783.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Other DLC for extra scenarios seems a bit overpriced as well. As far as I'm concerned I will not be buying any DLC until it goes on sale, even then I'll think twice about it. As for the main game it never seems like you have enough manpower either stockpiled or flowing in. AI battles on harder settings feel as though they have an infinite amount of resources while you are struggling just to send throw away units to keep them at bay long enough to call in bigger units. This game definitely needs some balancing tweeks. With the overpriced DLC I would suggest only getting this game if you plan on playing by yourself most of the time.

This has become the biggest hinderance for me to love this game further.  Microtransactions should be fine, but when it messes into the tip of balanced play, gonna need to say good bye to competitive multiplayer.  A game like this will never match its predecessor which was epic.  Keeping balance in-check is tremendously difficult if they keep adding new units like four or five times a year.  This game is far as into only a shadow to the original, or compared to Starcraft in term of multiplayer play.\n\nI did only spent by 200+ hours enjoyable when there wasn't P2W (Pay to win) commander in play.  When there was very few commanders available. Please note that metacritic score of 80 were granted at the time of the game released, but as the time comes, users score has only booked an abysmal 1.6 (overwhelming dislike) due to its DLCs.\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/company-of-heroes-2\n\nWhy are they bother much on Microtransactions?  Greed? the original price point of this game is already that high.  Worshiper fans would even buy the collector edition, which only gets them what?  think of it.  Even those collector edition players are still faced with the microtransactions.  The player level and bulletin? Its lookslike to be too unfair and further mess with balance twists, as well as too marginal benefit at the same time.

Relic has managed to completely ignore the aspects that made CoH 1 a really great RTS game, like command trees, good micro/macro balance etc. Instead they made a DLC heavy "pay to win" with shiny graphics. Recognize the concept from Dawn of War series? Booyeah!\n\nIs CoH 2 better than it's predecessor in gameplay? No. It only looks prettier (if you have a top of the line PC that is...) and is more expensive. Even though it's super cool when I can zoom in to see the wrinkles on my Conscripts uniforms it does not in any way compensate for bad gameplay, only micro and no macro, lousy pathfinding and a frame rate of 20 fps. The only real improvement from the first game is the option to choose grid layout for key shortcuts.

I tried to give the game an honest chance after the initial disappointment, but I could not take more than 4 hours of this crap.\n\nSo a recommendation to you all: get the good old CoH 1 with expansions and download some of the excellent mods out there, like Blitzkrieg, Eastern Front etc and get down to some serious WW2 strategy! :)","February 15, 2014","false","4.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Yes.\n\nUnfortunately that 'yes' has a big asterix beside it.\n\nI would never recommend this game at full price.\n\nThe game itself is great. As far as my opinion goes its not as balenced as it could be, but is currently the best its ever been. the Factions offer a lot of different strategy and tricks to learn. Wehrmacht are powerful and more inclined to defensive strategies until the heavy tanks can come and attack. Soviets are cheap on manpower for infantry and suit early pushing to deny resources.\n\nBUT.\n\nThe game is very incomplete. there is more DLC than devs working on this game. On the store you can find new camo skins and alternative commanders to provide different abilities and strategic options. I do not think this game is 'Pay 2 Win', but definately 'Pay 2 Have More Options'.\n\nWith the annual Xmas and Summer sales (and any other event), id highly recommend this game at 75% off and also purchase 'Western Front Armies' Expansion bundle for 2 whole new factions (Oberkommando West + US Forces) for greater variety and in general keep things less stale for you to play. If i were you personally, I'd also do a bit of research into some commanders to find one who'se abilities would suit you best whether for a defensive turtling strategy or an aggressive build from the start.\n\nCommanders to look into:\nMechanised Assault (Wehr), Lightning War Doctrine (Wehr), Osttruppen Doctrine (Wehr), Advanced Warfare (Soviet), Counterattack Tactics (Soviet) and Tank Hunter Tactics (Soviet).\n\nI think that with my suggestion to get a good handful of sale content, you will have a fantastic experience on my favourite WW2 RTS. except for maybe CoH1 which is still worth a play  :)","August 27, 2015","true","875.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Though it is similar by virture of genre and setting; It's not merely a sequel! It's a whole new interactive gameplay--from units to maps to missions. The basic game commanders as totally adequate for adding a lot of variety (which vCOH had only 3 choices) via the commanders. Buying the DLC just enhances the options though in few cases adds newer units or abilities. Personally, I like this--buy it if you want it approach.\n\nCOH2 deliveres a lot a fun, tense gameplay. Truesight, weather tech, and new infantry pathing abilities, along with a dynamically changing battlefield, really creates some great gaming. (Oh, vehicle pathing is still somewhat spastic.)\n\nThe asymetrical balance is somewhat daunting to learn (much like the Brits once nerfed), with the Wehrmacht being most similar to vCOH. Here the game made some subtle differences that makes the Wehrmacht somewhat easier to manage (without micro-managing). The Soviets, however, are fun but exasperating to play (to some degree like the Americans in vCOH). Soviet teching is not at all linear or even possible in many matches, given the massive bleeding inflicted by losses. Yet, once you've learned what combination of Soviet arms to cobble together, the Soviets really give the Wehrmacht a run for their money. Ultimately, a Soviet player has to be far more descriminating and anticipatory in what units to produce than the Wehrmact, since an early Panzer or Ostwind can ruin an otherwise good game.  Likewise, the stronger Wehrmacht tanks can't afford to get ahead of infantry support. Hence, Soviets arms typically dominate the Wehrmacht infantry, whereas the Wehrmacht tanks can outlast most Soviet armor. It's a truly asymetrical theater.\n\nCOH2 is a great game. Sequel-like but not a sequel. It's got numerous improvements (and differences....even when vCOH had some better aspects) that make COH, well, a bit old.\n\nCost of the buy-in is definitely higher; but the fun factor (for me) is worth it! Bigger than that, is the hardware requirements to run this graphic hog. But if you've got the gaming system that can run it, I'd recommend that you try it. It's not a FPS, but it's an awesome RTS.","January 7, 2014","true","473.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There is little new under the bonnet, more just a respray which as the original was excellent is not all bad.\n\nSingle player is not really where it is at but at least there you face AI as dumb as the AI of your own units which dioesn't really ruin the experience but when you get into multiplayer, especially 3v3 or 4v4 it is a real issue.\n\nThe biggest strength of the game is also its biggest weakeness you see - the constant micromanagement.\nWhile that adds skill and depth to unit on unit firefights and tactics and perhaps to the strategy overall for hardcore players it is a bit of an issue for most players because the AI is beyond bad on units you do not micro.\nIn many years of gaming AI seems to have gone backward in games and COH2 is the dumbest of the dumb.\n\nThis leads to enormous furstration as units will simply stand and die while you are away. MG's won't fire or resposition or even run if a unit is stood 1 inch aay outside their arc of fire. Apparently they don't realise they are being shot by somebody stood next to them.\nIt is the same with other units that need a facing order too and althought the fanboys will tell you it is part of the micromanagement it is clearly bad programming. You don't need the aI to be smarter than the player but asking them to face an enemy that is shooting them can't be too much can it? Or at least understand you are being shot and react in some way.\n\nIt is even worse with tanks, especially SU85's and slow turning tanks, I find them almost unusable on busy maps unles i use them more as artillery toward the rear and fairly static. Even micro managing a single tank is not possible half the time as the AI countermands your orders constantly to do something dumb when more than one enemy unit is around.\nGive an attack order on an enemy tank 5 degrees to your left - expect it to turn 355 degrees right instead (Except it dies from a shot to the rear before that happens). If there are troops around the AI will not only ignore the enemy tank  you desperately order it to attack, it will constantly turn its weakest part of armour to it order to take a pot shot at non threatening low value target and yes die. Sometimes you will battle with the AI repeatedly reordering it to attack a target while the aI repeatedly has worse suicidal ideas and does the opposite. It ends with your tank traversing left and right on the spot and yes dying.\n\nSame with the pathfinding. Give your troops orders without micromanaging their route and expect them to go the worse possible way. Want them to go 30 yards left, nah they would rather go the opposite way and into enemy territory and die to get there the long waya round. Some maps are not too bad but others it is a nightmare.\n\nMy advice don't bother unless the game is real cheap on sale. The developers could have fixed many of these issues over the 1 year+ the game has been out but they have been too busy making paid DLC apparently.\nCertainly I won't be buying anymore of their games based on previous history of a franchise.\n\n","July 28, 2015","false","562.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of DLC can be a big turn off for some. I feel that some of the commanders are Pay2Win (Elite Tiger anyone). Paint skins look nice but the price you pay is silly. I also feel the base game should have came with some of the extra factions, but of course we'd only have that In a perfect world.\n\nThough, I still enjoy the game. I have played a bunch of games as each faction and I enjoy all of them. Each has a different flavor. I also think there's a fair amount of units for each side. Playing against the AI can be fun for a while, but they get really predictable. Online play is hit or miss, sometimes you'll have a good round, sometimes you'll have a round with rushers (this can make the game unfun).\n\nIn closing, I would recommend this game to people who enjoy action RTS games, WWII games (and cold war-esque games), and Michael Bay (just the effects).\n\nBut as a tip, i'd get it, and any DLC on sale. 7.5/10\n","February 18","true","110.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game is still, as always, fast-operating, accurate, and ruthless, very fast, very accurate, and very ruthless! COH2 is a awesome game, those who love playing Warhammer should not miss it. Although THQ closed down, but our uncontrollable love toward RTS will never crush out. I recommend every single Sega game, it has a huge number of DLCs, but all of them are worth buying. SEGA is a good developer, it always offers a discount to those who preorder. It is much better than Square Enix, Capcom the bitxx, etc. Later I will continue playing SEGA's masterpieces. I am not an advertiser, an advertiser will never have such a good patient to type out nonsense like this and translate it, after all I have a public ID.

What I want to say is that this game isn't like other RTS game I've been playing so far. But after couple of hours, I'm starting to slowly understand the gameplay. And after another couple of hours, I'm starting to become addicted! This game is REALLY GOOD!!! Not only the gameplay is cool, but the graphic and the sound are also super super cool. i've never seen and heard a war scene like this game has in another game, I can only feel the same experience when I watch a film of Saving Private Ryan XD The UI is somehow retro-looks like, and that is another plus for me. The main menu music is soothing and making you feel that the world is indeed in a war. The screaming of frightened soldiers from dying, the bombard from mortar squad, the shoot fire from sniper, and the boom from the tank are unforgettable. Seriously, this isn't only a game. Its a pack of game, opera, drama and film in a bundle. totally worth to buy (i bought it half price thx from the discount lol)\n\nFinal result: Recommended. 9/10 (9 because its ranked matchmaking mechanism isnt that great)\n","September 18, 2015","true","36.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Well whether or not a game is good is subjective to the individual and what exactly your looking to get out of a game.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Modding Support through the Steam-Workshop offers all manner of mods, unit skins, decals, Player made maps, and more all for free and easily aquired with the click of a button.\n\n- Unit Diversity.  A counter for every move and with over 31+ Commanders to choose from per faction as opposed to the original COH with just 3 Doctrines to choose from per faction,  Each army has a distinct theme from focus ranging from Heavy Tanks, Specialized Infantry, Artillery, Aircraft and more!\n\n- Enviroment Matters.   COH2 offers unit bonuses for taking cover behind pretty much anything,  Destructible enviroments mean that a wall or house can be blown away to create new avenues to flank your opponent!   Weather can freeze your troops to death in the cold blizzards or slow them down as easy targets when they get stuck in deep-mud.\n\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- DLC,  Sega is rather heavy about DLC.  For example that fancy Skin you want for your tanks?  Or want a Tiger Tank but don't own the commander that offers one?   Gotta buy them.   DLC ranges from 3 to 5$ (prices vary on your region) but this can be mitigated both by the fact that COH2 is frequently on the Steam Sales where you can get the DLC for as cheap as 1$  or just download a Mod from the workshop that offers them.\n\n- The Single Player Campaign.   I have mixed feelings about the campaign.   The Soviet Campaign (which is free) was dark (which is IMO good) but the characters were boring,  I felt no passion to empathize with characters and the mission objectives were generic and rather basic,  What you would expect from a RTS.....   SEGA fortunatly learns there lesson when they introduce the American Campaign "Ardennes Assault" Giving us more interesting characters and unique mechanics for a Story,  making the campaign into a RISK or Total War style where you only have limited resources to conduct the entire campaign.   Unfortunatly this absolutely amazing Ardennes Assault campaign is DLC:  10$ on its own,  5 or 3$ during a Steam Sale.\n\n- Vanilla Gameplay is Boring,  Game ballance is about as fair as Starcraft,  but just like Starcraft that same  rock/paper/scissors can get boring.  IMO Get a realism mod from the Steam Workshop such as Spearhead or Wikinger just off the top of my head.   The All Units mod can also appeal if you don't want realism & don't want to buy the DLC.\n\n- Axis vs Allies.    This should be a common theme,   however where  the Allies are diverse between the Soviets, Americans, and the British.... the Axis are just Germans with a east & west theme.  SEGA has rich options to choose from between nations like Vichy-France, Italy, or Japan and yet they have been reluctant to pool from it despite showing they can with units such as the Ostruppen pooled from the various nations that were absorbed into the German Army.   COH2 has great potential if only they would do more then just present Nazi-Germany as the only overarching villain.\n\n\nIn conclusion,  COH2 is not a game for everyone,  I'd reccomend it only to WW2 Enthusiasts who want a plethora of options to choose from, and I would highly reccomend players wait for the Steam Sales (COH2 g oes on sale extremly frequently),  The game's not worth full retail price.  Bu with that said I find boundless enjoyment out of this game and still play it even today as my fallback enjoyment.","November 23, 2015","true","972.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Relic has stated numerous times over the years that they would look into it, but no progress.\n\nThat being said, having a slightly better doctrine (there aren't any premium doctrines that are stupidly overpriced) does not make you better at the game. I bought a "good" commander for 5$ but I actually started playing worse. Why? Because I was relying too much on the doctrine's super cool tanks and crap. Good doctrines compliment a good player but can't turn you into one.\n\nThat being said, the game IS extremely expensive for what you get. You'll probably want to pick up all the factions, so the final total is rather high. However, the game and dlcs go on sale for 75% with the winter and summer sales, so I suggest you pick them up then.\n\nAll in all it's a good game, just buy what you want at the price you think Relic deserves.","August 30, 2015","true","234.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Pre-arranged and random teams can play against each other, so if you don't have a partner for team games you're going to have a bad time. There are still a good number of players in ranked automatch while custom games are pretty dead.

It's obvious relic didn't have a clear vision for each faction, and the result is a wacky mish-mash of units which synergise poorly and make teching feel awkward. There are a number of highly situational or simply useless units, with the game balanced around a few OP units and abilities. The only logically designed faction is the Ostheer, which by no small coincidence are strongly influenced by Wehrmact from CoH1. Many games involve one or both players stalling with low-tier units in an attempt to skip the mid game and go straight to heavy call-in tanks.

Not only that, Soviet generals out-thought and out-planned the German high command by strategically pulling the military factories back, and denying Germans control of the Russia’s richest oil region.\n\nThe Red Army beat their enemy fair and square on the battlefield.

It doesn't matter how many buttons you press per minute, what matters is your brain and experince as a commander.\n\nVictories are earned and defeats are crushing, the graphics are highly detailed down to the paint scratches on tanks and the spent brass from a rifle.

As you can see i loved this game and played it more than any game in my life (been playing games since i was twelve and am 27).\n\nProbably the best and prettiest RTS i have ever played, crazy amounts of fun in multiplayer. Those 4v4 matches that turn to a stalemate and drag on for hours and culminate in a beautiful firestorm of blood and steel make me feel like i could be there on the eastern front. Excellent mechanics and gameplay with many interesting and accurate units fromt the time period.\n\nBut it was all flushed down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by SEGA, this game has made me boycott all SEGA products i will never ever gain purchase one of their games. Which breaks my heart because not only are they butchering Company of heroes but now they are destroying warhammer and warhammer 40k, Turning them into shallow ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC machines.\n\nTL:DR if you want to play single player, campaign is alright when you realise that it is based on a parallel universe where the movie enemy at the gates is the most historically accurate depiction of the eastern front and fury is the most accurate depiction of the Western front.

I definitely do not recommend this flop of a game. The only reason why I managed to log 33 hours on COH2 was because I wanted to like. I tried to like and played it thinking that I will get into it. Clearly it did not happen. The leveling system is very strange and not competitive in the slightest. If you lose, you still rank up. I personally do not find any fun in that. Game play is pretty dry and units can take quite a long time to kill now. For some reason there seems to be a lack of variety in regards to the amount of units that you are able to build which I find a bit odd. You would expect there to be more in a new game but this is not the case. Furthermore, the teams are uneven and everyone chooses the Germans because of their tank superiority which crushes the Russians so easily. Even the factions/commanders that you get to chose are terrible and do not add much to the game itself. In regards to the single player, I would not even bother. enough said. Company of heroes 1 and all of the expansions such as tales of valor and opposing fronts are amazing games and I still play them. So much better then COH2. Therefore, if you are looking to play a company of heroes game do not spend a single dime on COH2. Spend your money on COH1 instead.","January 31, 2014","false","38.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Now i've had this since it's staggering start. (AKA Company of Bugs). It has since came out with interesting stuff, just not enough to keep me invested. I'll give a quick rundown of what i mean below.\n\n\nGameplayGameplay is spotty at best, when i first got this game it was a mess, a trainwreck, i wanted to rid myself of it ASAP, but since January of 2015 i loved it (until now.) Everything was much more better then it was when i first played, no more freezing, crashing, or endless loading screens. Anyway...\nGameplay is like i said. Spotty at best, you'll get a few hours entertainment with the Story (Will give my opinion on that a little later.) And theater of war, i don't really understand that well.\nGetting DLC's is pretty much a must because this game has so little (Without mods of course. Will give my opinion on that as well later.) in terms of units, abilities, buildings etc. In the default game you have the Russians and the normal Germany army. Russia at best is more of a 'hoard' nation, building up massive amounts of infantry and tanks to flood your enemy.\nGermany is more or less of a 'defensive' role. Locking down supplies and basically camping, until later game when they get their most powerful units.\n\nDLC This is where Relic has always had a problem for me. Every since COH 1 i have HATED DLC. I dispise it and wish that idea NEVER seen the light of day. In this game your abilities are replaced by 'commanders'.. Most of these commanders can be unlocked by grinding insanely to get 'war spoils' or you can pay x amount of $$ to get a 'DLC' commander. Most of these are most likely crap and really not worth it. (IMHO anyway.)\nOther DLC's include camos, and the bane of existance and why i hate Relic. Nations.\nIn 3 seperate DLC's (unless you buy the Western Front(Armies?) pack) you get the battle hardened German OKW or Ober Kommando West if i recall. The US Army and British Forces.\nThe OKW are more or less of a late game destroyer, getting the most ungodly powerful units and killing you. (This is how i see every OKW player i face.)\nThe US Army (or US Forces) are completely defence and hit and run IMO. Their units are more or less paper, tanks seems underpowered. It's just a trainwreck to me.\nAaaand finally we have British Forces, oh god what a disaster. Let's see, you thought UK armor was bad in COH1? Haha, they made it worse in this one. The british tanks are so easy to kill it's sad, they have almost no stopping power. The only thing i can say they're good for is more of a 'tank' role because the churchill is a bullet sponge. Infantry are not really that good, i don't see anything 'special' about them. They just seem, bland and even more underpowered then US are.\n\nMods/CommunityThis is about the only thing i was eager to delve into, the community for COH is amazing, i absolutely love it. The modding community for Workshop make some of the best mods/maps i've seen. This i will say right now, is what helped me hit 100 hours, if the mod community didn't exist. I would probably have around 20 hours or even less.\nOutside the modding community the general chat and forums seem friendly, i've only run into a few people that seem just.. Uugh. I haven't played much PvP in COH2 or 1 so i can't really say how the 'competitive' side of the community is. But overall it's friendly and helpful.\n\nStoryOooh boy, how i hate the story. It depresses me because COH had a better story then this. Moving on with my small rant.\nThe story places you as a Russian commander (I may be wrong, i played the story like a year ago.) following the beginning of the fight for Stalingrad, Leningrad, etc. Where as all WW2 games have shown, at the beginning Russia gets their ♥♥♥ handed to them and then, after a while, start kicking Germany out.\nThe story is like any sob story (i swear to god the story REMINDS me of Call of Duty: Finest Hour) filled with loss, victory, defeat, death etc. etc. Like i said above you won't get much time in the story, it's just. Bland and boring, i don't feel anything tugging at me, leaving me at the edge of my seat or anything. It just feels like a normal RTS where you move from point A to point B and sometimes have the optional point C and D for bonus objectives.\n\n\n\nI guess that covers pretty much everything i have to say about this game. Do i recommend you get it? On a 70% off sale. At it's current price, no.\n\nIn total this game earns around a 7/10","January 14","false","152.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
