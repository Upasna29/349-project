I've been following this game for a couple years, and the devs  constantly update the public on the state of the game with monthly newsletters. Additionally, the game has been funded by two successful kickstarters, and was originally going to be funded out-of-wallet by the devs before it became a crowdfunding success. This is a project of love for them and I don't see them failing to follow through on the title due to financial or personal reasons.\n\nIn its current alpha state you should be aware that the game is not finished, but it is feature-complete enough to play and that access to an alpha makes you a tester as much as a player. You cannot expect a bug or crash free experience, and you will be asked for your input throughout the game on how well features or quests are implemented. However, what you are paying for is more than just early access to the game for testing purposes. The Repopulation will be releasing as a free to play game. By purchasing the game on early access, you are recieving the benefits of a Gold Member package once the game releases.\n\nI want to reiterate that The Repopulation has been planned and designed as a free to play game from its inception. This means eventually there will be a cash shop, but the devs have said over and over that it will be for cosmetic and Quality of Life items, and nothing so broken that it will make the game feel Pay2Win. Member packages, which I mentioned before, will be one-time payments that give you perks like extra bank space and cosmetic "pre-order" items.\n\nNow that I've got all of that out of the way, I'll move on to the game itself.\n\nHow It Plays\nI've decided to add a section to the review here that gives an idea of the basics of how the game plays, since I realize my pros and cons list (below) isn't super in depth on the different aspects of gameplay.\n\nWhen you start the game you will be in a tutorial full of rooms for different kinds of training (a med bay, a shooting range, etc.). The first NPC you interact with will tell you that you have your choice of what you feel like learning. I won't go extremely in depth into what every area of the tutorial teaches you, but I will urge that you visit every area and at least read about every skill you can. There is no cap on how many skills you can learn, and Alpha is a good time to get a taste for what you like and what you don't. Speaking of skills, each one individually caps at 6000 points. So while it is theoretically possible to become a grandmaster at everything, you're looking at a huge, huge dedication of time and resources. For this reason it is recommended that you specialize and outsource for the best use of your time.\n\n"Questing" in Repopulation comes mainly in the form of missions, which are mailed to you. Missions can be seen as requests by NPCs, and are randomly generated based on your skillset. For example, someone who focuses on combat might recieve a mission to clear out hostile creatures in an area, or a crafter might be asked to create an item and deliver it to someone. There is no overarching "main quest line" in Repop, so expect to have to come up with your own goals and motivations.\n\nCrafting is a very deep system divided across many skills, including Armor/Weapon Crafting, Cooking, Genetic Engineering, Robotics, the list goes on. Materials have Grades, so not all refined metal will be of the same quality, and this will reflect itself in the quality of the items you produce. If you want to go into one of the advanced crafting disciplines you will need the help of the player economy as no one person can easily collect and refine all the materials needed. I would go more in depth on this but I wouldn't be able to fit everything in this review's character limit; that is how complex you can expect the crafting to be.\n\nCombat can be done in the usual RPG 1-9 hotbar mode, or in "Action" mode using LMB+RMB and aiming with the mouse. There is a % based cover system, stances, dodge rolls, and resource management in the form of Momentum and Weapon/Shield Energy. There is melee, short range, and long range weaponry available, as well as a stealth mechanic. Every weapon and combat skill has it's own ability set based on how practiced you are with them.\n\nThis is just a very barebones look at how the game plays to help you make a decision, and the world itself has much more depth than I have room to write. So, with that in mind, let's move on to Pros and Cons.\n\nPros\n-A true sandbox experience. This game feels like a living world, with tons of options. You are not the themepark "savior of the world" (along with every other player that you have to pretend to ignore during the story), but rather a person living within the universe.\n-"Living within the universe" meaning that your choice of skills, jobs, and things to do is huge. Crafting isn't secondary to combat, it can be its own focus. There are no set classes, you "level" by practicing skills (i.e. using a rifle makes you better with rifles, etc.) You create who you want to be.\n-Player cities, factions, housing, shops... an economy and world based on players.\n-NPCs have their own likes, dislikes, lives and schedules. They will talk amongst themselves and how you handle quests will have an effect on how people treat you.\n-Combat, while not extremely ground breaking, is fun. Crouching, going prone, and the cover system add an interesting layer to engagements.\n\nCons\n-Because the game is a true sandbox, it can feel very overwhelming. This is especially true if you're not used to this type of MMO. The feature-complexity of the game also translates to complexity overall, and people who aren't intuitive or experimental may have trouble with learning to navigate the menus, crafting, etc.\n-The UI in its current state is cumbersome, however that is something that has been receiving tweaks and will hopefully improve.\n-I'll reiterate that the game is alpha and you will encounter bugs and crashes. This is a testing environment, and this con won't apply as much later.\n-Some people fear that the reliance on player-made content (as a player economy, player factions, and the social experience are a majority of the content as opposed to quest lines, etc.) will be a downfall. I think it's too early to do anything but speculate on that, but it is something to keep in mind.\n-Combat, while it has its positive attributes, can also be frustrating. It can be maddening to lose fights and not really know why. For example, since you don't have an overall character level it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that because you've been playing your character for a substantial amount of time that trying a new weapon out will just take your power down a little. Because every weapon has it's own skill level, weapon swapping, for all intents and purposes, means starting over at killing level 1 creatures. (There is a little leeway here as you will retain your defensive and generic combat skills, but it really brings home that you should specialize and commit if you're not testing new things for testing's sake.)\n-Combat can also feel like a means to an end sometimes. As crafting has such a deep and diverse attention paid to it, you wonder if you're just fighting for the sake of collecting materials, which can be disheartening for combat-centric characters. However I have not experienced PvP or non-starter-zone PvE content, so take that how you will.\n\nFinal Point\nAs the game stands I would definitely recommend you follow it for its release, even if you aren't interested in participating in the alpha.","December 28, 2014","true","20.2"," 220 of 231 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","220","231","0","16"

The learning curve is so steep it might as well be a brick wall. Three days in the game and I'm barely comfortable leaving the main city to poke trash mobs, and Ive barely started nibbling on crafting.\n\nThis game is also incredibly complex, beautiful, and clearly much loved by its developers.\n\nDont look here for WoW. Dont look here for SWTOR. This is truly an "Old School" game from the days of Star Wars Galaxies or the very first Everquest. This is a game for the MUD nerds and the Tabletop masters with skads of reference material on-hand from the days of grid maps and notebooks.\n\nThere is very little hand holding, there are no classes. Dont complain about haivng to craft a hundred different sub-components to get your speeder bike. Because that's what this game is about! It's about complexity and spending hours to master some tiny aspect of the game that makes you an invaluable cog in the greater machine. I love this game. I love it /because/ it is overwhelming. It gives me so much content dropped into my lap like a knotted fishing reel that I'll spend forever pulling apart the strands until I understand the mechanism.\n\nThat's what this game is about, and it does it very well for being so very early access.\n\nNow, dont get me wrong. It /is/ still early access. There are glitches, texture collisions, quest-killing bugs, and the framerates grind a bit. But for all its warts, I can see the diamond underneath, and I cant wait to see where they take it.\n\nIn conclusion : Buy the game with the understanding that this is a HARD game, and it is an EARLY game. But it smacks of nostalgia, and it's a wonderfully refreshing challenge in a world where MMOs are designed to cater to the whiny masses and dragons practically slay themselves.","May 28, 2015","true","62.9"," 101 of 109 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","101","109","6","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/riolis/recommended/322300/","riolis","Riolis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/riolis/","961 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n*edit : They have updated quite alot so this review might not be relavent anymore. Will update once this game get more polished*\n\nI've never played SWG or UO before, so I was kindda curious what the game like, as I was looking for games that put more emphasis on crafting system and economy like Wurm Online and Haven and Hearth does, and I've been dissapointed time and time again with the current ecosystem of MMORPG. All the other MMO that I've played put crafting and economy as a side mini game of grinding that the only main objective is to drain your gold coffers (so you would microtranscation more gold from them). I wanted to find a game that making something is meaningful, not grinding harvesting and crafting by making worthless items just so you can make the end-game items, and any items you made before that is pointless and garbage after you level up a few times. And this game is EFFING it!!\n\nThis game will be a complicated game to review, since it does have a huge pros, and also a few deblilating cons.\n\nPros :- Crafting is meaningful. Each of the item you crafted is useful. Each items made is used in alot other recipes. You can make almost every single item in the game. And you can actually do, without too much of a grinding like in other MMO, you can make alot of things using the lowest quality items and its not a hassle to do it at all. But to make a really high quality items, you need to depend on other and this is where the grind is. How cool is it to be a master crafter of making single core processor motherboard :3\nAnd I must say, when you make something, the satisfaction is astounding. <3\n\n- Fitting system. Fitting system is great since you're not tied to a armor or weapon, and you don't need to change your armor/weapon/accessory every 5 levels. If you found a set that you love you can just stick with it and customize your armor to be what you want. Slashing defense maxed out armor? Full armor penetration defense armor? Hell yeah.\n\n- I haven't experience the player housing, town and shops, but any game with that is a huge plus.\n\n- Living world. Day and Night cycle. NPC have their own schedule like what Ultima 7 had. Alot of MMO keep yapping on and on about how their game is alive and how the city is bustling, yet when you're the only one in the area, its feels like you are in a town fulls of puppet, every NPC just stand there doing nothing. This game means it and NPC will close shop at night, Guard stop patrolling the town outskirts at night, Guard will change their guard post every day. Shopkeeper will go to the disco at night.\n\n- Quest is randomly generated based on a template. Each area have their own quest type and story. Not one player will have the same quest like the other one (kindda). While the quest is not that great and buggy, but its a huge step on the right direction. Each quest is different (somewhat) unlike the old system where the same NPC keep forcing everyone to collect the same bloody 10 animal hide over and over again. This game is on the right path, imperfect but on the right path. While you have to send the cupcake to the guard, your friend might be sending some rose to a girl. <3 and another guy is sending a cupcake to the guy in the pub.\n\n- Away from the stupid classic leveling system. Mega plus. The more you do on certain area the more it will progress, and you will get skill point bonuses also. This is what all MMO should aspire to be.\n\n- Huge world and multiple passanger vehicle and mech!!!\n\n- Dance routine (that give buff to everyone depending on the type of dance and the dance step) and story telling (that also give buff to everyone depending on the type of story, plot-twist and ending, oh and anyone can jump in can contiue to story tell the story started by another.). Make a camp in the wild, and start playing the guitar, dance and storytell, and then go lay teh smackdown on the bandit camp nearby.\n\nCons :- Early Access : God the game is buggy as hell. I know its early access, and people need to be reminded that the game is buggy and it does takes off the enjoyment sometimes (ok maybe more then sometimes). Wait till the game enter a more stable stage if this is your main concerns.\n\n- Combat is very unpolish, laggy and not particularly fun. Well I've seen worst (aka Fallen Earth) but I hope they can polish it more down the road.\n\n- UI is nasty. just plain nasty and unfriendly. The ingame Map is probably the worst I've seen in any game, hard to read just filled with freaking orange colored dot that can mean anything, even worst when compared to Fallen Earth in-game map (and Fallen Earth UI is first on my Top 10 list of most nasty UI in an MMO). UI is unresponsive, the map (M and Shift-M) is impossible to use. Mini-map should just be deleted for how useless it is.\nCrafting UI is bearable, Quest UI is pretty bad. And omg, the talking to NPC UI and speech bubble is horrible nasty piece of buggy crap.\nPlease dev, fix this at the utmost priority. UI is the most important gateway for user experience in MMO. User spend more time using the UI then combat, then gameplay and all the other thing combined.\n\n- Character Creation is pretty bad too and buggy on top of that :( which is really making me sad.\n\n- Player economy is yet to sprout because of the lack of player. Hopefully this will change once the game goes Free2Play.\n\nNeutral points:- Graphics is way behind, but if you want to play an MMO with beautiful gals with perfect bewbies and booties physics, then the Korean Dev is working hard to make those. I prefer the dev to spend their time making the game mechanics more unique and fun rather then asking them to spend most of thier time making the bewbies bounce prefectly and copy-paste the old, tired and grindy MMO recipe to offset the time wasted. Rather you should just google "Porn" watch it then come play this game.\nBack to the point I wanted to make, the graphics is not great, but it is playable. While I would love this game to have the graphic of TERA and gameplay of Repop (wet dreams) I know thats not possible, and I would choose gameplay with a playable graphics any time of the day.\n\n- Very steep learning curve (like 90 degrees steep, also known as a brick wall), but once you get the hang of it, its like magic, everything will seems to make sense and you will love the complication of the system. Will probably turn alot of poeple off tho.\n\n- The community is filled with smarta$$. Not quite sure to either to put it as pro or cons. The community is matured, no tarding chat because most of those type probably quit in the tutorial. Unfortunately this make the community very stiff, and  asking a noobie question in chat will usually get you ignored or answered in a non-helpful way since everyone thinks everyone should already knew the obvious things already, and shouldn't be asking about it, and any points/suggestion made in chat that the game should be more easier to understand will be shot down pretty fast. So beware.\nI find this refreshing though, no more global chat spam about virtual sex and all that crap, god, Tera chat is nasty.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DRI recommend this game wholeheartedly if you :\n- Can handle a buggy early access.\n- Can handle a huge learning curve.\n- Likes making shiny things.\n- Dont mind the laser from your gun shooting from your bottom at times.\n- Likes to support a dev who is making what a MMO should've been all this time, not like all the garbage that is out there.\n\n5 cats out of 5.","December 29, 2014","true","24.7"," 112 of 130 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","112","130","5","2"

Well that's what I am going to explain to you today. The repopulation is currently in alpha stage, soon to be entering closed beta I believe. By buying this game either on steam or from their website you are paying for a game which will, at launch, be F2P, however you aren't just paying for early access you are also paying for a number of benefits outlined here (Repopulation website[www.therepopulation.com]) which includes things such as head start, name reservation the gold and silver memberships (which give you increased bank,character, auction, shared bank and mission slots) and repop tokens. The repopulation steam purchase is the equivalent of buying their $39.99 pledge and works out cheaper than the steam version, on a side note if you buy it from their site then you get receive a steam key as well. Now onto the pros and cons\n\nPros\n-Diverse and free skill tree system (there are no classes so you can specialise how you want to e.g. a flame-thrower wielding diplomat, ironic I know)\n-In-depth character customization system (plenty of sliders and the like or a basic system as well)\n-Brilliant Crafting System (the system works out so that your character(s) should only specialise in a couple of crafting skils, however if you wanted to be a crafting master and max every gathering and crafting skill you can, this would take a VERY long time)\n-Unique quest system (there are different types of quests such as quests tailored to your character, generic quests, quests which can only be completed for a short time, open-world quests involving lots of players, a la defiance)\n-Lots more interesting content to come\n\nCons\n-The graphics (when set to maximum are not groundbreaking however they certainly aren't bad or substandard)\n-Glitches/Bugs (Although I have experienced next to none many people say they experience lags or crashes)\n-Combat (much like the graphics the combat is neither ground breaking nor bad and with some improval, including better attack animations, they will be good)\n-Lack of in-depth tutorial (although there is a starting area which does its' best to teach you the basics of the game such as the skill system, combat, crafting etc. it still leaves plenty up to the player to learn. However the community, at least on the EU server, is very friendly and more than willing to help you out)\n-Lack of direction (This is, in my opinion, one of the hardest things to get to grip with as after completing the tutorial you have a massive open world ahead of you and very little guidance as to what to do, but in some ways that is the appeal of it as you can, from the outset, go out buy some recipes and/or equipment to start your crafting career,go  kill some mobs, complete some quests, just explore the land, try your hand at some PvP (although that'd be ill-advised), join a guild etc. As part of this is the difficulty of finding NPCs; you have to inquire with other NPCs, use your tracking skill and sometimes just bide your time).\n\nConclusion\nOverall the repopulation is a very immersive and enjoyable game, with a great deal of potential, but whether you buy it now or wait till beta or even launch is really based upon a number of factors; can you deal with a character wipe before launch, do you want these extras such as a headstart, more slots etc, can you deal with an unfinished and sometimes glitchy game and finally can you cope with a game that does not give as much of a helping hand as other MMORPGs. I hope my review helps you to make your mind up and most importantly have fun!","January 6, 2015","true","23.4"," 68 of 77 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","68","77","0","0"

After I read one of the guides...well...It honestly changed the whole game for me and am now making some really decent headway in charicter developement. It is a little rough on load times and still crashes once or twice every couple of hours, but hey...Its Alpha. It was advertised as such so it has to be expected. Honestly though it preforms better than many games I've tried that were full releases. There is ALOT to do, learn and try in this game. It can be a casual game but it's hard to put it down sometimes even when i'm getting stomped. The crafting system is pretty advanced and it has a new skill system similar to that of EVE online. (Skill books.) plus if you buy the weapon skills you get a free gun, grenade or Sword, ax etc. apropriate to the skill learned. (I.e. you leard automatic weapons you get an assault rifle.) One of my two favorite weapons in game so far are the sniper rifle and flame thrower. (You can also add fittings to the weapons and armor to boost certin atributes.) ....and they have pets! Who doesn't want virtual pets...and no virtual Poo to clean up. They have a limited amount of vehicles that I suggest buying for other players rather than NPCs as the quality, availability, and prices are much better...I bought a light mech...It has a gun...I shoot stuff.\nIt's a keeper.","January 13, 2015","true","158.9"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","59","64","8","3"

But I was fortunate enough to play SWG (both pre and post Combat Update and NGE).  Much of The Repopulation is very reminicant of my days as a TKM (Teras Kasi Master) trying to get to blue glowy (Jedi), with some notable exceptions.  Therefore, the comparrison that the company makes is a very fair one as far as SWG is concerned.\n\nThe game is highly skill based.  There are your main skills (of which there's around 75) and then there are skills within the skills.  I will use the character I have played with the most (I've tinkered with three) to try to illustrate the point.\n\nMy main character is primarily a hunter type with some gathering side abilities.  There are several but the ones he specializes in are, mining (minerals and ore extraction from nodes), wood cutting (cutting down trees), and survival (skinning animals and scavenging for water).  There's others but those are the ones I use.  For every mob type there is a set skill pertaining to them.  A common early mob is a Setlang, they are reptilian dog-like creatures.  As you hunt/skin more and more of these creatures you begin to become more and more familiar with them.  So there's your overall skill (say survival) and specific species skill (in this case setlang) the higher they both are the better you do, obviously.  This holds true across the board.   Are you a miner?  What kind of miner are you?  There's a skill for each ore too.  Woods man?  What trees/plants are you good with?\n\nOn the flipside.  Lets say you go into crafting.  The same thing applies you have your base crafting schools, lets say chemistry, and then you have all of your chemistry recipes.  They have separate skills associated with each one of them (i'm quite the badass water distiller but i can't do acid extraction for crap).\n\nHarvesting is interesting in that you have several options.  There's auto harvesting (you can put down extractors over some nodes) and there's manual extraction.  Many nodes under manual extraction come with 2 other options enhancement of the node you're on, and enrichment of the area.  As an area is harvested it looses quality and it shows in the nodes.  The immediate and personal fix is by enhancing the node you're working on but it only works for you.  Enriching the area restores the area's quality not just for you but everyone.\n\nThe game is in alpha so please expect crashes, bugs and issues. They aren't abundant but they exist, most can be fixed with a soft log.\n\nPros\nMassive skill system\nGreat in game community\nVery ambitious\nRewarding if you're willing to work for it (those who seek immediate gratification go elsewhere)\nDecent early teaching methods (nooby training instance)\n\nCons\nSteep price tag for alpha *redacted con, see edit*\nAlpha lots of bugs, they're being worked on but it's alpha\nFuture possibility of microtransactions\nSteep learning curve, with many skills "hidden" for you to discover on your own, and little direction given beyond the original training instance\n\nAll in all, if they add a twitch based flight aspect I will be at their door screaming "Shut up and take my money".  As it sits, for me, it is worth the early investment.  These guys are clearly serious and want the game to work.  That being said I enjoy alphas and betas, and realize many don't.  So if you're one who wants a clean and polished game don't buy in yet.  The game is clean and has some polish, but isn't finished yet.  They are making progress (think an update comes out today or tomorrow actually) but they've still got work to do.  The price tag of 40 bucks for an alpha is a bit steep in my opinion but being that it harkens back to my days in SWG as much as it did I took the plunge, and am glad I did.\n\nThere's many things that you can do in game that I've not mentioned this is strictly the path of one of my characters, the character is truly yours when you get in.\n\nEnjoy\n\n-Rk\n\nEdit: Thanks to WubZero for bringing this to my attention.  There's been a price reduction removing that con.  Game is now 20 bucks as opposed to 40 now makes it a very viable competetor in the current market.\n\nThey do plan on having twitch based flight once they've smoothed out the majority of the ground game.  So we are at "Shut up and take my money" status.","February 2, 2015","true","77.1"," 60 of 66 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","60","66","3","11"

Do you like complex crafting systems (the good kind)? Do you like the freedom to level 1 or 2 things or Everything if you want on one character?\n\nThe Repopulation might be for you, then.\n\nUse any weapon, or heal.\nTame wild animals, or make your own to fight with and / or for you.\nCompletely customize the way your character looks on creation, and afterward in-game if you didn't pick the right things. Think about the Saints Row Series - make a normal-looking or goofy character if you want.\nEntertain and buff yourself and other characters in rest zones like pubs in and outside. Not near a town? You can pop open a tent and do the same with your group.\n\nNot interested in being a good guy? Stealth your way around and pick pocket / steal from people and shops. Become an assassin with rogue-like abilities - backstab with one or two knives for massive damage. (From my experience, starting out along this path is a little tricky in the current state 7/29/15). There are several skill lines that are beneficial - Stealth, Assassination, Bladed Weapons, Thievery, etc.\n\nWant to build your own robots, vehicles, and other advanced items? You may want to consider joining a nation (guild). Crafting is complex for most advanced items and you may want friendly teams of people gathering to accelerate the process.\n\n\nThe game is early access, which means many things haven't been refined to perfection, and there are still some features on the "To Do / To Add" list. In its current state, I can still recommend this game to all those interested in it. Be warned; there is a guaranteed wipe slated for the launch of the game. There are only rumours of other wipes between now and then, but no official word on any.\n\nThere are GMs that occasionally do testing with players ingame to hunt down bugs and troubleshoot various things. Watch General chat for opportunities like these.\n\nOn live streams (Twitch) you'll be able to get info on new features, ask about development, etc. As of the one that was done a few days ago, I had the opportunity to ask about Space Exploration ("Will we be Repopulating other planets at some point?").

I have not seen a lot of the game yet, and I have spent most of the time I currently have logged trying to fully understand all of the basic mechanics the final product will revolve around. So this is mainly a performance and theory review. Since most of this game is subject to change over time.\n\n------------------\nSystem Information\n------------------\nTime of this report: 12/25/2014, 14:59:00\nMachine name: SODOGAMING\nOperating System: Windows 8.1 64-bit (6.3, Build 9600) (9600.winblue_r3.140827-1500)\nLanguage: English (Regional Setting: English)\nSystem Manufacturer: Dell Inc.\nSystem Model: XPS 8500\nBIOS: BIOS Date: 08/28/13 10:44:30 Ver: 04.06.05\nProcessor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3450 CPU @ 3.10GHz (4 CPUs), ~3.1GHz\nMemory: 8192MB RAM\nAvailable OS Memory: 8152MB RAM\nPage File: 3318MB used, 6114MB available\nWindows Dir: C:\Windows\nDirectX Version: DirectX 11\nDX Setup Parameters: Not found\nUser DPI Setting: Using System DPI\nSystem DPI Setting: 96 DPI (100 percent)\nDWM DPI Scaling: Disabled\nDxDiag Version: 6.03.9600.16384 64bit Unicode\n---------------\nDisplay Devices\n---------------\nCard name: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti\nManufacturer: NVIDIA\nChip type: GeForce GTX 560 Ti\nDAC type: Integrated RAMDAC\nDevice Type: Full Device\nDevice Key: Enum\PCI\VEN_10DE&DEV_1200&SUBSYS_089810DE&REV_A1\nDisplay Memory: 4043 MB\nDedicated Memory: 971 MB\nShared Memory: 3071 MB\n\nThere is currently a lot of performance issues for people near or meeting recommended system reqs. The game is playable with my system specs, and in most places I can get 40-60 fps with everything set to low. Granted the options aren't fully developed yet so there is only so much tweaking you can do to enhance game performance. The Hero Engine works in cells. So when you enter a new cell in the world map it can cause a huge drop in frame rates. Another major issue to be noted when considering purchasing this early access is the large memory leak the game has. Generally memory leaks lead to constant game crashes, but this personally isn't the case. The main problems from my experience with the memory leaks is that The Repopulation has a rapid declination of performance over an extended period of play time. Now I am not saying that this won't cause constant crashes for others, and I have ran into a few crashes myself.(The crashes I've had were mainly from tabbing to my second monitor while at the loading screen.)\n\nNow, for the people who want to focus on testing out the crafting system. There is a bug that will frequently cause your recipes to disappear requiring you to reboot the game application in order to continue crafting. Another bug that is somewhat annoying is your inventory and items disappearing.(which will effect people who want to craft, or people looking to test combat). The last two major bugs people should be aware of before purchasing is a game crash on respawn, and your hotbar being bugged on respawn and not showing ability cooldowns.\n\nPerformance summary = EA is not for everyone, and if you at least meet recommended system reqs the game will be "playable". Keep in mind this is an early access alpha so expect everything to constantly be breaking, or not be working as intended.\n\nThe theory of the game is very community oriented. I like this concept however in the current state I feel that the direction the game is going in the developement team is relying too much on an over complicated crafting system to supplement the lack of content. The crafting system is extremely amazing and intricate, but the foundation of the crafting system requires a large and active community to keep supply up with the demand.\n\nStarting out I felt as if I was missing the direction I should be going or as if i was not "playing" the game correctly. I feel like this thought process came from my experience of all the other mmo's inbetween the time of Star Wars Galaxies and The Repopulation. There isn't a story line that you're tied down to. You choose how you want to play, and the mission system is the perfect flavor for me. You can find missions that are static pick ups off of npcs, but most of the quests will be delivered right to your mailbox. Play the game how you want to play there is nothing linear about it. Do what you want to when you want to.\n\nTheory and mechanics review = Intricate crafting that is heavily interdepenent on other people. The load of work required to be the master of a craft is too much for one person. I currently think the crafting should be slightly simplified but with time those sort of things will be ironed out. Being able to pick up and turn in missions on the fly without having to go back into town is just awesome, and you have the freedom to master all of the combat and crafting professions as you desire.(It would take an extremely large amount of time to do so.)\n\n*Overall review*\nPerformance= Early access plenty of broken things\nCombat = unpolished but the concept is definitely there\nCrafting = Amazing in depth system that lets you tailor items to the stats you want and need! (currently over complicated and doesn't have the population to support it)\nCommunity = If there is a game to bring back the concept of an actual community The Repopulation is the one.\nContent = currently not there but this is to be expected being Early access. (Only future patches will be able to tell us what is to come. However, it currently feels like crafting is taking place of content.)\n\n\nShould you buy The Repopulation alpha early access? I'm definitely not going to say no, but you should consider some of these things. The Repopulation will most likely not run well, and you will have to deal with unexpected downtimes. However, most of the concepts are very ambitious and interesting. The game has plenty of potential we just have to see in which direction the dev team takes it. Like most other reviews I will also say if you loved SWG pre-nge (That includes pre-combat upgrade AND combat upgrade) you will most like feel comfortable in The Repopulation. For people who have not played SWG if you do buy The Repopulation EA don't get confused. The game feels like too much to take in at first, but it's set up to give you the freedom to be whoever the hell you want to while in game.\n\nThumbs up to The Repopulation it currently has a lot of problems and questionable content. But this is a game that I know has potential to be the next amazing thing, and I wish The Repopulation the best of luck. I will be extensively testing this title!","December 25, 2014","true","61.3"," 63 of 73 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","63","73","0","6"

It will be free to play when it releases in mid-late 2015\n2.The graphics are still very WIP\n3. Most of the systems will be very intimidating when you first boot up the game, as they are extremely complex\n\nDespite these reasons, The Repopulation is the best MMO i've ever played. I paid $20 for early access, and can say that the game is fully worth that price, let alone the low price of free later in the year. All of the features that you see are here: Once you get out of the tutorial, the game literally says "Im not giving you any more direction, go and do whatever you want." You can switch to action mode with Shift+A, and the game will play like Mass Effect rather than World of Warcraft. You can also switch into first person mode with shift + F, but it's a little buggy. When people say this is like SWG, they mean it. You can dedicate your time in this game to learning how to dance, and only how to dance. There's a skill tree for dancing, and throwing in different moves will add different buffs. You can also be a storyteller, a weaponsmith, a herbalist, a hunter, a pyro, the list goes on. When you start off in your beginning town, you will recieve emails which detail missions tailored to you based on the decisions you make. If you want, you can ignore them. You can select which missions you enjoy more. There are vehicles to ride, weapon classes to learn, ores to refine, all of this in an early access game. The servers are not empty; the chat is booming on the server im on, and there are more than 5 other servers to play on as well. Seriously, spend $20 on this game. Sure, it'll be free in about 5 months, but you really should not wait for this experience.  Just know that the UI and models are rough around the edges, and you should find hours of entertainment in this.","February 15, 2015","true","9.8"," 58 of 68 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","58","68","0","0"

This is the greatest compliment I can possibly give a MMO and I don't feel I need to go into that even more. If you haven't played something like Ultima Online or Star Wars Galaxies, imagine EVE on the ground.\n\nSWG vets, this is for you.\n\nCurrent state of the game: It is unfinished, it is unpolished, but the mechanics are there and it has a TON of potential. If they can get this right, I think this will be the most solid sandbox experiences on the market for a very long time. This isn't ArcheAge and this isn't Black Desert Online. This is as much of a sandbox as Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies and EVE are. There is the "themepark" elements, but it's all merely icing on the cake since the players are the primary source of content and there are systems in place to keep us playing and have us make our own experiences.\n\n(I've been in the alpha since early 2013 and have played the game for hundreds of hours before it was available through Steam)","December 22, 2014","true","18.8"," 89 of 118 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","89","118","0","7"

If you don't know what that means, probably best to avoid the game until it progresses into a beta stage.  The developers always seem active and open to feedback.  GM staff is usually always available in game if you hit a snag with most issues.  /newbie chat is most times filled with helpful people (so long as you actually paid attention during the tutorial :P).\n\nI would caution you to bring your engineering degree along if you plan on delving too deeply into crafting because it is quite literally rocket science.  Most crafts also have strong interdependencies relying on the other crafting fields, so it's not a recommended solo experience.  And why have we gotten the notion that MMOs should be solo experiences in all things?  You can eventually grand master every skill line on one character, but don't put the cart before the horse.  Soft cap is currently 6k per skill line (when you stop gaining abilities) with hard cap being 60k per skill line (with small gain improvement depending on the skill line after 6k).\n\nThis game is trying to recapture many of the sandbox aspects that have been ignored lately in MMOs.  One of the more important being the social aspects that I feel should exist in all MMOs.  You'll need people for far more in this game then hitting the queue button and waiting for a pve dungeon or pvp map with perfect strangers and then never see them again.  Personally I was excited to see sort of a re-imaging of the Entertainer from SWG providing buffs to people who stop into the pub/cantina (the /tip function is also in this game!).\n\nI've also missed my Creature Handler and there's a few different pet style branches here as well.  Animal Handling - tame baby animals in the wild to fight for you/become mounts for you and maintain them with Vet Medicine (or let another vet maintain them for you), Robotics - build your own robot and outfit them with fittings to suit your needs, and Genetic Engineering - take tissue samples and dna samples from various creatures and make your own mad scientst one-shot consumable-on-use clone pets.\n\nThere are 75 total skill lines at the moment to discuss (as well as hidden skill lines), so I won't talk in depth about all those, but I encourage to check out the official site and wiki to learn more.\n\nAll in all, this game has a solid foundation to be a decent sandbox which the industry is severly lacking at the moment.  If that is a niche you miss or want to delve deeper into; consider backing.  If you'd like to play a more optimized game... continue to wait until this game moves into beta phase (still a few months out from time of posting).","February 25, 2015","true","236.0"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","48","54","0","0"

He wished and he wished for a Computer and the money to fund his dream. Time past and he grew older his dream still alight within him he learnt of Computers and their ways, ventured into the PC Gaming community and saught out adventure yet still he did not have the funds to complete his dream and it was put on hold yet again. Time past by till eventually Sony decided to close their Star Wars Galaxies servers forever, the boy was heart broken his dream crushed all hope destroyed, he would never venture to Tatooine and shoot Tusken Raiders, never explore caves on the icy planet of Hoth or slap Gungans because they are so damn annoying on Naboo...\n\nHis dream faded into the past only occasionaly reminded of it by Youtube Videos and the odd discussion among fellow gamers. He moved on taking up arms against others in different realms and worlds fighting for different causes a lone wanderer without a home. But then one day he stumbled upon The Repopulation. "What is this?" he said aloud in surprise, it was a game that was incredibly similar to Star Wars Galaxies and it was in a Kickstarter, his heart soared he may not be able to live in the Star Wars universe but he could damn well come close with this game. He bided his time yet again and waited... and waited... and waited.\n\nIt was Christmas 2014 the young boy...long since ageing into a man stumbled upon The Repopulation again on Steam he began to debate it's purchase "Is it worth it... can I afford it?". The man was conflicted so he took to the Steam reviews. Review after review spoke of how it was similar to SWG. He put his foot down and decided to gamble for it.\n\nUpon entering the world of Rhyldan he knew he has found what he wanted for so long he had character customisation, free form skill tree progression with the ability to change to a different variety of weapons without being stuck with one class, men who played as women and jumped around alot and most importantly he had no idea what he was doing. Despite all this he was happy... and well how do I know he was happy you may be asking?\n\nI am that guy. (Of course you've already likely figuired that out so no suprise there)\n\nSerious Review\n\nFor a game in early access I find it pretty fun it has main functionality and the devs are looking to add much more content before release so that's looking dandy.The combat is like most MMO setups but does offer a Third-Person Shooter mode it isn't grand but it makes a nice change. The ability to be able to rank up and use all weapon types greatly pleases me too many times I have felt restricted by other games due to their enforcement of a specific class, although it was fun to start with the novelty and the wanting to use other weapons grew.\n\nWith Character customisation you are able to modify your face and build etc, there are a limited amount of hair styles at present but enough to keep most satisfied such as myself. A nice feature I have found was upon visiting a store I was able to purchase a cheap cosmetic item to change my facial structure this greatly pleases me as I always screw up something in my characters in all games.\n\nBeing a Social / Sandbox MMO you are able to do a variety of things I have seen dancers, crafters, people on floaty bike things reminicent of the Scout Trooper bikes from Star Wars. You can also cook, build robots etc.\n\nThere are some issues with Repop such as weird little feet indicators that clip through your clothing however these are barely noticible unless you are wearing specific clothing, I also imagine this will be dealt with at some point in the near future. Other issues would be new comers at least in my experiance might not be sure what to do, it took me a while to figuire out the NPCs could help me locate mission based NPCs when they weren't on my map for a quest. All in all though for an alpha it is pretty good and it looks promising. I have seen data that suggests it will be coming out as Free 2 Play so you may wish to just wait till its fully released and not drop a penny but if you are like myself and don't mind some bugs, helping out devs and getting early access then it might be up your street.","January 3, 2015","true","9.6"," 80 of 106 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","80","106","3","10"

You can tell where the team's inspiration came from. It reminds me of the early days of SWG and seems to have the best parts of that game, Anarchy Online, UO, Vanguard, and others.\n\nEven in alpha the game is playable and easily worth the $20. I've been waiting for a game like this since they butchered SWG. I even went so far as to try SWG emulators and others. I played Vanguard until it went offline as well.\n\nThe good: Solid base so far. Combat is pretty fun and you get a choice between RPG (tab target) and FPS style. The mission system is convienient and being refined. The skill trees are diverse and varied. The crafting system is complex (see below). There are numerous ways to progress your character (combat, crafting, harvesting, diplomacy, entertainer etc). These  are completley viable playstyles in and of themselves. And you can technically do them all on the same character (classless, lskill point based progression with no limit on skill points accrued). Pets, tamed, bought, built. Yes, you can go tame baby creatures and raise them, build bots, genetically engineer pets, etc.\n\nThe bad: I love crafting. I spent at least a solid year on SWG doing that almost exclusively (by hand, no macros). I love the fact they are trying hard to make the crafting (and other professions) viable. That being said, at first glance I think it's a bit too complicated and interdependent at the moment. There are very few (if any) low level recipes that are useful in an of themselves. Interdependence among crafters is forced. Even most low level recipes require components from multiple disciplines. You might as well include harvesting in this as well, as your skill at harvesting affects the quality of raw and refined mats. Unfortunatley it relies on the premise there will be crafters fulfilling all the parts required. A crafter just starting out, who has no money, cannot collect higher grade mats, and/or make high grade end products, will basically be forced to run missions and grind out sub-par items for xp.\n\nKeep in mind this is a first impression and solely an opinion. I may very well change my mind after a bit more time.\n\n\n\nThat being said, I see HUGE potential. I think they can streamline it a bit, ease up a little on the interdependence, and tone down the recipe complexity a little. Honestly, even if it doesn't change much, I'd still play and most likely craft. I don't see it attracting many crafters in it's current iteration though.\n\nI'll update as the game progresses. This is my first review after years of playing games on Steam. I'm not the guy that generally takes time to write reviews, but I really want this game to succeed. I'm tired of the trash that's being churned out.","June 10, 2015","true","31.1"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","36","37","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/veo808/recommended/322300/","veo808","Veo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/veo808/","47 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOne of the few games out there with such depth.  I've just completed my second week on this game and have been amazed by the vastness of the world and item (read: crafting) system.  I've never played Ultima Online or Star Wars Galaxies, but other players ingame say that those are the closest comparisons.  I like to think of The Repopulation as a Runescape on steroids with a touch of EVE Online. While I could talk about various aspects of the game, I'm going to focus on crafting which seems to be the strongest point in the game currently.\n\nPros - Crafting\nThere's a highly complex crafting tree for making things like weapons and armor, vehicles, consumables etc.  I specialize in Armor Fittings, which enhance the stats of your armor.  Unlike most MMOs out there, the armor and weapons themselves don't matter as much as the fittings which you insert into them.  In order to craft Armor Fittings I rely on other players to harvest ore, wood and plants which I then turn in to refined metal bars, firewood and chemicals to craft the components that I will eventually need to make a single fitting.  If no one is gathering Calibrite Ore, and the auction house is empty, then I must go out and gather some myself.  Armor Fittings are one recipe of the larger Armor Crafting discipline, which is itself one of several hundred skill paths players can choose from.  The interesting thing is knowing that you rely on other players on your server to gather materials that you can't gather, and to craft items you can't craft yourself.  While you can theoretically DIY, it takes significantly longer than bartering and buying/selling to and from other players.  Plus, advanced items require dozens of ingredients to come together.\n\nCons - Crafting\nThe system can be daunting to players who are used to very simple crafting systems like World of Warcraft and other theme park MMOs.  In a theme park MMO you would mine ore, refine it into bars, then use that to create items.  On The Repopulation each ore gives different properties to a finished product (armor penetration, damage, resistance, movement speed, critical hit).  Ores also come in varying grades with a letter prefix A-F and an integer suffix 0-9 which can only be harvested by those with high skill in the corresponding ability.  So to make a very good quality Armor Fitting I would need to hire a Master Miner, and a Master Ore Refiner just to ensure that the metal bars I have are the best possible.  I would also need a Master Forager to gather plants, and a Master Chemist to synthesize the compounds I need.  I could do it all myself, but training 4 skills to such a high level would take months to attain.  Recipes are highly complex, and you will find yourself opening your web browser to check on agents, and sub-ingredients to make those agents quite often during crafting.  Once you do get the hang of it, though, it gets much easier and manageable.\n\nCons- Other\nThe graphics leave something to be desired.  The engine seems old, so the models ingame from players to NPCs to the environment are lower quality than most people are used to in 2015.  As an alpha game there are some bugs and glitches that still need to be ironed out.  You can phase through objects when zoning between areas, and the combat seems clunky rather than fluid.  With a still new player base, everyone's still in that learning process so it gets frustrating at times when trying to find others to help you build cities or craft items that you need.  The game is not easy to play and requires some thinking.  After playing the game for two weeks it feels like I took college courses in Chemistry, Geology, Mechanical Engineering.  If you're looking to just zone out, then the crafting system isn't for you.  But the combat and doing missions is still very viable for someone not looking to get too involved.\n\nFor a quick overview here are the numbers:\nThere are about 15 different weapon types you can choose from.\nThere are currently 100 or so skills you can choose to specialize in.\nThere are around 1,000 recipes to choose from when crafting.\nThere are 60,000 levels for each skill.\nLevel 500 Mining took me about 1 week of gametime to reach, but each higher level takes more and more time.\nSimple crafting recipes require about 4 different ingredients to create.\nAdvanced crafting recipes require about 20 different ingredients.\nThere are 52 types of harvestable nodes in the game (ores, wood, plants...)\nEach harvestable resource can be further broken down or combined with other resources to create even more complex components.\n\nQuick Tips:\nThere are no levels in this game besides your levels in each skill.  Someone can have 6000 points in Fishing, but have 0 in Combat.\nMonsters become easier/harder to kill depending on your weapon type and your armor type.\nTo get "better" weapons and armor, you must add Fittings to them to add stats.\nWeapons and Armor have almost no stats besides Physical Resistance without Fittings.\nThe world is mostly player-owned apart from the starting cities.\nThe economy is 80% player-run and 20% vendors and NPCs.\nThe world is large.  It takes a very long time to traverse the landscape on foot, which is made easier with vehicles.","March 9, 2015","true","254.0"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","32","34","0","0"

This is a game that won't have you getting bored at end game and making an alt because you can do whatever you want for as long as you want and you'll be playing for ages doing so.  Or if you're like me, you'll be skipping all over the place and end up a confused mess.  This game isn't the prettiest game (yet?) but if you're into crafting, this game has that in spades. If you're into easy questing, once again, it's there.  If you're into exploring, there's a huge map to explore with massive environments everywhere.  If you're into a great community, I haven't met a single unfriendly person yet and I've put a good 40 hours into the game (I was playing before it was on steam)\n\nThis game sends you into a world like a baby, confused, barely knowing how to breath, giving you the basics that you need to get by.  You'll learn how complicated the crafting system is, and the basics of crafting but there's so much more to absorb it's quite overwhelming at first. If you ask people though, they'll always help you out.  There's so much to find, so much to do, and so much to craft it's insane. After 40 hours gameplay time I'm just starting to get my bearings on how the crafting system works, I haven't even looked into the housing system or anything else.  I've just been gathering and crafting for that much time.\n\nAll in all while you'll start out a bit confused, you'll learn, you'll laugh, you'll love, you'll get frustrated but you'll keep coming back for more.  I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a deep, complex, smart game to play instead of "Collect/kill this many whatever and come back to me" kinda game.","April 28, 2015","true","47.8"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","30","31","0","0"

It has the potential to be the game I will call home for the foreseeable future.  Skill based system, player crafting economy, player housing/cities/nations and many other great features.  It all reminds me of UO and SWG (both early era) which are two of my favorite games.  If you have never played a skill based game before try it with an open mind.  No more leveling, what you actually do is what you become good at.\n\nFirst off, the game is very rough around the edges.  It’s Alpha so expect Alpha.  For Alpha however it is very impressive compared to others I’ve backed.  Everything in general works.  It might not be pretty but it works.  My review will just be an example of a single play session as a complete noob:\n\nLog in, check my in game e-mail for any quests I’m interested in.  If one looks good I take it, if not I simply ignore them.  I hit the local bar/pub (allows you to enter a resting state that makes entertainment abilities usable) to do some Entertainment activities such as dancing and storytelling (this is the game’s buff system, the more people around using entertainment skills the faster you seem to stack buffs and of different types).\n\nOnce I get 6 stacks of all the buffs I can that last more than an hour, I head out of town, with my Adult Setlang pet and start murdering stuff with my rifle (gaining rifle skill and animal handing doing so).  I harvest any lumber or metal I can find as well as the corpses of the fallen (gaining survival skill and knowledge of what I kill).  Using my survival skills I upgrade the resources harvested as far I can (quality in materials matters to crafters).\n\nI’m working on my personal short term goal of building a speeder bike so I focus on the mats needed to create this (found by access an outside website for crafting, expect plenty of this).  If enough time goes by I also use my survival skill to create a camp in the wild to enter a resting state (same as the bar) and refresh my buffs.  If you have 6 stacks with a minute left, it only takes 1 more stack to refresh all stacks to max duration.\n\nI find any baby animals I can tame and do so to raise animal handling.  I also have to craft food for my pets and feed them every hour so they can continue to grow to adulthood.  Eventually I’ll be able to turn them into mounts if I choose depending on the animal.\n\nEvery fight I gain skill in Stealth, light armor and whatever other skills I use.  If I have to run and heal I gain in healing skill.  What you do is what you become good at, you get the idea.\n\nThat’s a very basic example of what’s going on and it all works.  The animations are rough, the sounds are not great and not directional, the graphics glitch and the engine lags at times especially around what appear to be server lines but it’s still Alpha.  If the game can get polished up it will be a real gem.\n","May 28, 2015","true","23.0"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","1"

Never buy an early access game unless that is what you are intending. Early access is not typicly for people who want to simply play a game, or people who want to test to see if they will enjoy it later. People who do this usually get a poor first impression and do not enjoy the full game, when they would have loved it at release had they not been turned off by their early access experience.\n\nNow for my actual review:\nThis game is making huge strides at recreating the Star Wars Galaxies Pre-NGE gameplay. So much to the point that I ditched the emulator for it to participate in this games alpha/beta proccess. I can not give any comparisons to ultima online however, as I never touched that game due to personal circumstances.\n\nWhat this game does well is truly allow you to be what ever you want, with out a scripted story or class system get in the way. I my self love linear stories for single player expiereinces, but I never could get behind it in an MMO setting.\n\nOther things are:\n-Completly open world\n-Die hard sandbox\n-Caters to both PVE and PVP players without comprimisng either types play quality\n(VERY important to me, as I prefer PVE)\n-Ability to play your entire time without being a combatant, yet still fill a very important role.\n(Weapon Smith, Docter, Entertainer [Yes those are actually a BIG role], Resource gatherer, Cook, etc)\n-Ability to build your own cities (As in custom build the structures and interiors) so long as you have the people. If you get enough folk to join you, they will start to fill the NPC pop and provide quests for you\n-Better quest system. You get quests in the mail based on reputation. You can filter them to recieve only the quest types you want (I.E. Combat only, Resource gather only, Delivery run only)\n- Good Charecter customization\n-Excellent skill system\nAnd many more features I can not rememeber at 1:35 AM\n\nThis game does have issues, but none of them are really GAME issues so much as BUG issues.\n\nOver all, I highly recomend when it comes out. Right now though, only buy if you intend on bug testing and giving feedback for the devs. I enjoy simply playing it in the proccess, but I also have an abnormaly high tolerance for masive bugs and unfinished features. If you want to enjoy minimal bugs and fully fleshed out gameplay, early access is not for you.\n\n","January 7, 2015","true","23.6"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","36","41","0","2"

There is a grading system in place. 50 grade levels with F0 - A9 that applies to components, ingredients and the actual items crafted. There is a big learning curve with the crafting system and it is designed so you are dependent on other crafting professions for certain high level components.\n\nThere is the normal AH, accessible from anywhere that also allows you to place work order for others to fill (think EVE).\nThe levelling system isn't straight forward, it is similar to SWG (from what I can remember) but not exactly the same. You pick up a weapon and the beginner skills, and you level it by using the weapon. When you reach a certain level you unlock an ability, but you do not get the ability yet. There are two ways to attain the ability, one is to spend training points which are given to you for completing missions. Mission completion can also give reward you directly with a choice of ability. It's a little hard to explain.\n\nAnother element of the skill/levelling system is Skill Imprinting points. All sorts of in game actions can reward you with SI points, which you can then invest in the relevant skills to give your level a boost.\nThere are two main factions warring with each other, and you can create your own third faction and align them with either main faction. I've not had a chance to play with this feature yet but as far as I know you can change your alignment at any time.\n\nCombat seems pretty good to me but needs a little work. You can roll like in GW2 and there are a lot of combat classes such as Rifles, Automatic weapons, grenades, aerosol, bladed weapons, unarmed, blunt weapons, martial arts, axe, handguns, probably a few more and you can dual wield some of them. And shields.\n\nThere are healing abilities that require a healing scanner in the main hand, so any class can heal but it requires swapping out your weapon.\nAnyone can play the entertainer class that dances and tells stories to give buffs. You can only do this in a "rest" zone, which comes in the shape of inner city bars or player placed tents when out in the wild. You can tame animals with animal handling or buy them from a genetic engineer, use robots made by robotics, go fishing, logging, foraging or mining. Place harvesters, get into hacking or diplomacy. Culinary arts can make food buffs, stims made by pharmacists. There are stylists, interior decorators, disguises, stealth, traps and quite a number more that I've not mentioned such as armour/weapons crafting etc.\n\nI know that every time a new game comes out, someone makes a huge post listing all the great features it has and tries to get people hyped. We're all a bit above that kind of hype train nonsense now but I hope that the info I've given is of some help.","July 5, 2015","true","107.5"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","0"

The game needs a lot of polish, and can, at times, rattle a nerve or two.  However, the game is fully playable, has a great community, great staff, and great development team.  You will almost certainly never see anything about thievery in the game.  Arguments are generally quick, and allowed to vent themselves out.  The whole atmosphere of the game is very helpful.\n\nDevelopers are constant presence on the forums for, both, Steam and the main site.  In-game GM's are a constant, and interactive presence.  9.5 of 10 times you need a GM for something, there is one there for you.  You whispers GM's directly for any questions, or help with bugs.  For the most part, the community will help with trying to resolve your problems before you need to speak with a GM though.  We answer the same tired questions from new people like they did for us when we were new, and nobody complains about it.\n\nNever be afraid to ask any questions in the game.  You'll always find someone to answer your question, and without belittlement.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay itself:\n\nPros -\n\n1. There's an immensely huge crafting system that will wreck your frail little minds.\n2. There's vehicles, and mounts.\n3.  There's an entire line of skills and crafting focused around taming, training, and healing pets; which can be used as mounts as they evolve.\n4. There's PvP.  However, atm the PvP system is a bit goofy, and arena based.  There are PvP contested areas in the world, but not currently activated for PvP combatants.  Like, you can go there, kill mobs and stuff, but can't be Pk'ed.  That will change with upcoming patches.  Also, there will be a hardcore, full Open PvP with loop drops.  This hardcore PvP server will be every definition of Hardcore.\n5.  You can mine, fish, gather plants, log, and set harvester machines down to do the looting for you.\n6.  The economy is player driven, so there is a lot of trade going on constantly.  I'm not going to lie to you though, at the game's current state, the market hotly debated upon.  There's this whole grade quality vs demand thing vs skill thing going on...  It would read to be more complicated and broken than it really is, so you'd have to experience it for yourself to understand it.\n7.  There are many, many different wpn choices you can choose to specialize in.\n8.  The world is huge, and it can take a long time to travel to some places.\n9.  There's player housing, both, instanced and open world.\n10.  There's player built and run cities.\n11.  There will be flight.  There was talks that once drakes are tamable, you can fly them as mounts.\n12.  There will be space flight, and other planets in future expansions of content.\n\nI'm sure there's a lot I'm leaving out, but I've listed a good bit.\n\nCons -\n\n1.  Endless bugs and glitches.  (it's alpha, stuff happens)\n2.  The whole economy, and crafting system can be very overwhelming to new players.  At times it can still be confusing for old people.\n3.  Crafting needs a lot of love.  There are aspects of the crafting system that are hotly debated, and need some serious tweaking.\n4.  Not everything is in the game yet.  (like I said, it's alpha.)  Some things you're just going have to cope with.\n5.  You will get stuck a lot.  Happens to everyone, and is usually fixable with a number of in-game commands, or other tricks.\n6.  Things will go invisible, and you will have to exit to desktop a lot.\n7.   The map systems are glitchy, and at times will white-out, blackout, or brown-out; causing you to exit to desktop.\n8.  You're going to experience periodic server crashes.  They are not frequent, so you don't have to worry about crashing every ten minutes.\n9.  Questing system is glitched, and needs a lot of love.  Some quest you cannot complete, the tracking system is far from helpfu, and the rewards need a tweaking.\n10.  There is night and day system in the game in which NPC's are highly reliable on.  Most NPC's are out only during the day, but some are out only during the night.  This can make questing difficult, and confusing.\n\nThere's a lot more I could put here, but I'm not here to scare anyone off.  The overall game-play is still very fun, very doable, and highly worth it in my opinion.  As I've repeated several times in this review, it's an Alpha game, we as a player in an Alpha Phase game, you are /will be a tester.  Testers report the bugs encountered to help improve the game.\n\nIf you feel you can be patient, helpful, and want to make a difference in something, I encourage you to purchase this game and join us.  We're all friends here; even the people we dislike we get along with.  That's the type of community we have.  A good one.","March 17, 2015","true","558.0"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","0"

Repop is uniquely deep player-driven organic sandbox ♥♥♥♥♥♥me. It is not a themepark, nor is it a harsh and hectic open pvp FPS.  One has control over every skill element through the tutorial, then upon use, and continuous refinement and focus on a skill, you can progress in them.  After the initial tutorial you pretty much have your choice of how you want to pursue your career, build your character, from that point onward.\n\nIf you prefer running missions, they have an advanced mission generation system that ensures you'll always have missions to do. It creates these based on your characters skill set and reputation. These aren't all simple missions either, the generation system allows for some very advanced missions, there are some that have 15+ steps but generated elements, NPCs, items, etc.\n\nIf you aren't a combat person, you can make your living in trade skills; player-driven auctions and house. Advancing in trade skills is independent of combat and does not force you into a combat role. As with combat, they have a complex trade skill system which allows for a high degree of customization by mixing and matching components. It also has a high degree of inter-dependency on others, which is going to drive the economy.\n\nThere aren't have caps to the number or mastery of skills so you can invest in each skill line how you see fit. It does take awhile to master each, so it does make sense to focus in fewer areas or work with others who can help to fill in the holes.\n\nFor example, trade-skill progression is both vertical (gaining more skill unlocks more abilities, better results from recipes, etc) and horizontal (I am skilled in both rifles and first aid so I can switch those roles if needed). Their vertical progression isn't as polarizing like in WoW (you might not be able to take a more skilled player in a 1vs1, but a 2vs1 it is very possible).   In SWG terms, you could have a 14 point tailor who is ALSO a master bounty hunter!  The same is true for The Repopulation.\n\nGuilds, I think, will enjoy their nation system which allows them to construct cities in the open world, and to besiege the cities of their enemies.\n\nFans of public quests like Rift, Warhammer or Guild Wars 2 style events will enjoy the engagement system. It is similar to what you saw in previous games, but can also mutate and spread based on how players interact. Many of the engagements have long-term effects allowing content to cater itself to the way players are performing.\n\nSuffice to say players have a high degree of freedom and choice, as opposed to being leashed to a path in a closed instanced world. Be it through entertainment, diplomacy, raiding, upgrading, vehicles, pet types (robotic, engineered or tamed), and three faction PvP.","January 18, 2015","true","17.5"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","0"

Overall I really like the game. Crafting is in depth, possibly too in depth in some cases. But overall I like the sandbox feel, I like how you get quests and the fact you can filter them so only the types of quests you like are offered.\n\nThe Devs are great about listening to feedback AND communicating what's coming on the patches. Is it buggy? Yes it is an alpha in the true sense of the word. Yes there will be at least one wipe before launch. But even with that I don't mind the play testing and losing progress because well it's fun and it isn't like I won't be able to skill up after release and will by then know the way everything works.\n\nIf you like not having your hand held, can stand a slightly steep learning curve, and don't mind truly play testing not just "playing early" then I'd say give it a shot!","March 2, 2015","true","56.1"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","1"

It is still very "alpha" so if you're looking for a very finished game this is not it. How-ever it's currently only 20$ right now, (Sadly it was 15 on sale for awhile) for that price i would say it's worth buying right away. There is plently too do and if you enjoy a game that doesn't hold your hand like the days of old it does it well. There is so many ways to play the game how you want, from crafting to PvP - PvE, farming, quests, favours, exploring etc etc. The sky is the limit.\n\nSide Notes:\n\n1. It will be free to play on release, (how-ever i'll tell you why i think you should buy it read on)\n2. It's currently running in 32bit and not 64bit, 64bit is coming soon though, which will improve visuals and lag massivly.\n3. You might lose your sense of time.\n\nCrafting:\n\nThe best thing about the game in my opinion is you're able to play the game as fully a crafter if you wanted.\nWant to be a server known bartender, with your own place selling the high quality drinks and food? Well you can.\nIt has a very intense crafting system, with many diffrent aspects from Genetic Engineering too building structures, and a lot more. You can also play the game without ever doing any of it that is so your desire.\n\nSkill System:\n\nAnother system very inspired from SWG, and also very like old Runescape.\n\nAt the very beggining you're able to learn any skill you want, the more you use said skill the more you can do it with it better it will be and more you can unlock. From diplomacy to unarmed fighting there is plently too choose from. ( I recomend looking at their website for a complete list too many to talk about here.)\n\nHardcore Server:\n\nThe standard ruleset should be suitable for most types of players. You have a full compliment of resources and PvE tiers available in protected areas. If you wish to partake in PvP activities you can venture into contested territories. Players can also create Rogue Nations which work as their own faction, allowing them to ally or war with nations from each of the other factions. The nation vs. nation warfare system creates player driven gameplay without harshly punishing players for participating.\n\nThis style of gameplay is a little too softcore though for many players who are coming from some other sandbox titles though. And that’s where the “Hardcore” ruleset comes in.\n\nIf you are familiar with the security setup of EvE it works in a similar fashion, but with a few wrinkles.\nPlayers can optionally enable Free For All Mode and openly target their own faction if needed, but doing it in a security zone will quickly lead to a faction hit. Players will have a reasonable amount of safety in High Security areas (mostly major cities and encampments) and a varying level of reduced safety from there, with less and less punisment.\n\nPlayers can use crafted biolocks to make it more difficult for other players to loot their items upon death. The hacking skill can be used to attempt to remove these. Lower tier biolocks will simply destroy the item on failed attempts, but higher tiers will prevent the item from being looted. Top quality biolocks offer improved protection against destruction and degraded on death. Crafted Salvage bots will be available to retrieve corpses after a short period of time, but players can deploy jammers to confuse the bots or simply destroy them.\n\nThe hardcore server will feature global auctions, but with local delivery. It will also feature local banking, as opposed to the global banking of the standard ruleset. Transportations of goods is important and if the buyer/seller are not in the same location the goods will need to be transported.\n\nQuick travel options are not fully finalized, but will either be disabled or restricted.\n\nFaction System:\n\nThere is a 3 faction set in place, OWON FPR, and ROGUE.\n\nThe first two, OWON, and FPR will be very familiar to anyone who knows about 2 faction system. Think of it like Empire vs Rebellion or Horde vs Alliance.  How-ever you're not stuck with them you can leave them or even get kicked from them. Then there is the 3rd faction known as a Rogue nation. These are player made factions that are able to ally with OWON or FPR, or can be at war with everyone or even neutral with everyone.\n\nThere is player run cities as-well that can faction align or choose not too.\n\n\nSo, as i said earlyer it will be free-to-play on release. How-ever i highly recommend buying the 20$ early access.\nThe game is very complicated and there is plently to learn and now is the perfect time to do it before the game is out.\nTest all the diffrent combat skills from Aerosol to Axe's, test all the crafting , fishing , robotics , and animal taming. See what you want to do in this game, you can do anything you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n","March 13, 2015","true","20.8"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

I loved it and after a while I moved on to Guild Wars and then Star Wars Galaxies. If any of you remember SWG you know that the game had a tremendous cult following in the world of mmos. WoW came out and SOE decided that their games should be pulling as much revenue as Blizzard was doing. They ended up murdering alot of what I loved about SWG though I continued to play it for a while afterwards. In the end though I just ended up going to WoW because it was a more polished game that was sticking with the vision the devs had set out for. SWG died and I played WoW for years... buying expansions as they came out. If anyone keeps up with WoW you know that it has lost half of its player base with the recent expansion not delivering on the hype of the previous xpacs. I again stuck around and gave the game a chance hoping it would pick back the pace but it just did not happen for me. So I went on a binge of trying different mmos until my buddy told me about this gem. I have to say that the game has alot of potential. Giving that we are still in alpha and how fun the game is I am very excited to see what the game will play like when it goes live.\n\nPros:\nSandbox Gameplay... This is where the game shines. Many mmos that claim to be sandbox are usually all hype and not enough substance. This game delivers at being very open ended. Even the quests are randomised and tailored to your character and the skills and approach you take.\n\nSo many skills... Again I love this. There are no combat levels. Just your many skills you start off with and the choice is yours on what you want to level. If you want to be a melee then choose your weapon. The more you use it the more skill you will aquire with that weapon type. This is reflected in the crafting and non-combat skills too.\n\nThe Crafting... OMG! If you like crafting in mmos and love complex and in depth systems such as SWG or the higher end minecraft mods... you will love the crafting in this game. There is so much to it you have to check it out to believe it.\n\nOther non-combat skills... Dancing, story telling, diplomacy... There are many things to do outside of combat. They claim that you can play the whole game without fighting. While I guess that is possible... I don't know if it is as feasable as they say but even still there are a slew of things to do outside of combat and crafting.\n\nNation Building... While many games have guilds or clans that you can join this game takes a different approach and lets you create your own faction outside the two set ones called Nations. Nations are similiar to guilds except in a nation everyone outside your nation can attack you. You can form alliance with other nations to counter this but this takes building relations with other people which I find to be intriguing. The town building is very nice too and throwback again to SWG and older mmos where you can have your own housing and utility buildings for various things like shops and guildhalls.\n\nPvp... While I haven't been able to explore alot into this yet I will say the vision of what is possible seems pretty cool. Being able to seige other player cities is the biggest addition and the devs are still implementing new systems to this. Again unlike WoW where you have just horde and alliance... this game allows you to build your own faction and thus making you a primary target for everyone. While there are ways around this it still brings alot of potential to pvp players who love open world type pvp.\n\nAnimal Taming and Robots... The pet system on this game is good. The more your robotics or animal handling skill is... the more pets you can control at the price of a debuff. There are many features as well not seen in many mmos such as having to care and feed for your pets among other things.\n\nGraphical style... While alot of people shy away from the stylized graphics of this game I personally find them very suitable to the immersion. It does feel like mass effect and SWG met up and had a baby but that is perfectly fine with me since I loved both games.\n\nFree to play: and the devs swear that it won't be pay to win. We appreciate this.\n\nCons:\n\nStability: This is the main issue with the game right now. There is lag and crashes and just overall weird glitches rampant as of 10/10/2015. The next patch is suppose to clean alot of this out so I won't be too harsh on this. That being said this is the worst experience of the game at this stage.\n\nNo instances: while this is a good thing too... I tend to find the lack of dungeon-crawling aside from the occasional cave or what-not. Just yea the pve could use a bit of a boost and not saying that instance dungeons are the way to go but in my experience this is where pve shines in mmos so the devs will just have to get creative on this aspect if they want the end game to keep those raiders hooked to this title.\n\nCrafting and other systems can be a bit overwhelming at times: Again this is both a positive and negative. I personally love the deep systems but alot of players will look at it and be like yea !@$! this. If you are familiar with crafting systems in WoW and other mmos this is by far much more sophisticated. If the devs give this kind of love to the other systems... i.e. pvp and pve that will be needed to keep a strong and dedicated player base going then yes this will be a fabulous mold of a different approach to all things mmo.\n\nSo again this game is still in alpha so I am curious as to see what the devs have in store for future patches. If you are looking for a great mmo to get in on the early stages then look no further.\n","October 10, 2015","true","42.6"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","33","40","0","1"

One of the few MMORPGs to be kickstarted and community funded.  This is a special Indie project that has brought together a number of different individuals all united with a passion to develop The Repopulation and make it the best MMORPG it can be.  This is a game where the community is respected and respectful, where the Devs answer multiple posts on a daily basis. Where one person's idea or suggestion can find it's way into the next patch.\n\nThis is a game where volunteers are welcome to bring their enthusiasm and skills to making this game be the home so many people want to see.

There is indepth and complicated crafting that deeply appeals to those who want to sate their intellectual curiosity on working out what part of the web of interdependent crafters they want to craft in.\n\nThere are missions that cater to everything from a basic courier mission, to a heart melting story about love and loss in the Protests that helped shape the current political climate and war.\n\nThere is a contested area in the middle of the two main factions where anyone can be attacked. It is here that rogue nations can set their own diplomatic relations with all factions and nations and build cities to house their citizens and then defend those citizens against incursions from enemies.\n\nThis is a game about offering choices and letting people make and be known by those choices.\n\nI backed this game in January 2014 and I do not regret a single penny.

Holy ♥♥♥♥, this might be exactly the game I always wanted\n.) Holy ♥♥♥♥, this done so unprofessionally and going to fail so hard\nbut I wanted to learn more.\n\nTheir website mostly was more bullet-point lists, just like the Kickstarter page and video, very fine-grained details, but I was utterly unable to get the big picture. Still, some of those bullet points were very intruiging - and I felt I'd rather have that game try and fail, than to never have it get a chance in the first place. So I backed.\n\nBacking the game so early reserved me an early alpha spot, and so I was able to start playing (... well, "testing" rather...) the game in June 2014 - long before it ever was released to Steam Early Access. I've spent several hundred hours with the standalone client since, and only installed the Steam client recently - for the more comfortable update process, but am still mostly running it with Steam off.\n\nSo, can this game be recommended? What game? This is an alpha which potentially might become a really good game later on. But right now, it is an uncomplete, buggy, work-in-progress development version full of placeholder stuff and still lacking some core features. There is absolutely no meaning in reviewing that - so let me give you some insights into this "Early Access" instead.\n\nI've been in several early alphas before (the real, broken ones - not those marketing-stunt demos) - most notably the one for Hellgate: London, which I got into extremely early - and after that experience, a few bugs - no matter how serious - are not going to get me baffled.\nAnd The Repopulation alpha has always had quite a few, and quite some serious bugs throughout - all the one-and-a-half years I've been into it (with some breaks). This is the sort of alpha you should join, if you want to see how a game is made, and get some insights into the development process - but definitely not the sort of alpha you should join, if you want a polished experience close to the final product.\n\nThat being said, the team behind this low-budget indie game appears to be tiny. Less than 10 people in the core team I would guess + volunteers. And I am convinced that they are not touching the engine code at all. It's the Hero Engine - the one SWTOR used for networking and server-client stuff with another graphics engine on top - and there's an unrelated team and company working on that one. That also means, that if there is bugs and problems with the engine, the Repop devs can't do anything about it, other then report it to that other company. They do seem to be in close contact and permanent exchange however - it seems the engine team/company is invested to support this game, to get a nice showcase for their engine.\n\nWith that in mind, a few things do become clear: This game is NEVER going to be able to compete with the big MMOs out there in terms of graphics, polish, usability, content, etc. If you want something grand and accessible and modern - you are not going to get it here.\nThis is a niche game - definitely not for everyone. This is not going to be your next mainstream blockbuster or the next big thing.\n\nBut there is a small niche which this game does seem to serve very well: the people who are bored to death with the linear on-rails experience of those currently pre-dominant themepark MMOs, with their broken economies, soulbound items, instance-running, capture-the-flag pvp and what not. The people who want a true sandbox game where they can be everything - and anything, and are not being led around the world by a carrot on a stick. People who want that freedom of choice, who want a player-driven economy where everything in the game is made by players, where you can have your own house, where your nation (=guild) can have and upgrade it's own city, where you can choose to be a dancer in a bar and become really good at that - if you so desire. And that's a rare thing.\n\nSo, can this alpha/Early Access be recommended?\nThat depends on what you expect from it.\n\nThe game is being updated regularly (almost bi-weekly). Updates are small but regular - often you might not notice any change, but they almost always bring in new missions, new crafting recipes, new items, new NPCs, new enemies to fight, new resources to harvest, and step by step slowly improve existing stuff. If I think back those one-and-a-half years ago, the game has changed, grown and matured A LOT. But it still has a long way to go, and I'm currently not convinced that it will be quite ready at the currently aimed for Q1 2016. That's not a fixed release date though, and will be delayed if neccessary (say the devs).\n\nThe devs are approachable and very active on the official forums. They read all posts, answer questions and consider suggestions made by members of the community. They also often explain some of their thoughts, and sometimes discuss some of their or some players ideas openly. If you want to contribute - you will be heard.\n\nThe community was very helpful and friendly in the early days, and remained so during the first half year I played. Then the servers were wiped for the Steam release, many of the veterans left after the wipe to wait for release, the game was opened to all backers and large numbers of new players rushed in... I took a break then too, and when coming back a few months later, community friendliness had degraded quite a bit. Still, most the more harsh and insulting discussions seem to revolve around the hardcore PvP mechanics, so I do have a sliver of hope that once there are separate hardcore PvP servers available, the friendliness on the regular servers might recover a little bit.\n\nSo, do I recommend The Repopulation?\n\nYES I do. I already spent hundreds of hours with the game, playing on and off over 1.5 years - and have no intention to stop. So, for me personally, backing the game on Kickstarter was totally worth it.\nMy taste in games might not be mainstream, and not be shared by the average player out there - but if your taste is anything like mine, you might like this game too.\n\nBut honestly... don't take my word for it. Nor the words of any other "reviewers" here. Go watch some player-made videos on youtube. Go check out the games' website (it's better now than it was 2012). Make your own decision. If you are unsure and the pricetag is not an amount you spend easily - wait for the final wipe and subsequent release, when you will be able to play for free - and then you will be able to decide whether you want to buy a membership package or not.\n\nBut if you are intrigued, want to see the development version of the game, the price tag does not hurt you, and you are not afraid of the risk of paying now and not knowing how the game will turn out when it's done - and you like the idea of financially supporting the development of this game - well... what exactly are you waiting for?","September 17, 2015","true","19.5"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","32","39","0","5"

Servers are not dead, but the world is so big its hard to find people in the open world.","May 7, 2015","true","71.1"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","0"

Definitely reminds me of star wars galaxies, minus the star wars characters.\n\nI started off with the freedom faction to get started.\n\nCurrently working on genetic engineering. I have stacks and stacks of vultures ready to attack at will! Pretty awesome.\n\nPros:\n-TONS OF SKILLS and no path you must follow! Skill up whatever you like!\n-very pretty game\n-lots to do and no right or wrong way to do it!\n-super sandboxy; create cities with your "nation" which is basically a guild.\n-Multiple ways of playing the game, and no need for actual combat if you dont want to.\n-play in MMO mode or RPG style like Mass Effect. Switch between the two seamlessly!\n-Awesome tutorial (didnt get to try it before they updated it)\n-Amazing crafting! Can make just about anything you can think of\n\nCons:\n-still in early access so it does have bugs\n-crashes frequently  but quick to load back up\n-Very steep learning curve; new tutorial does great though!\n-Very Grindy(while not a con for me, it could be to others who like faster gameplay)\n-Could have a better friends list option; kind of a pain to navigate to\n-POssibly a more descriptive and easy to use map\n\nOverall an excellent game. Im sure it will be amazing when its completely finished. As of now though, it seems like there is endless content as is! I've put 12 hours on it in 3 days of playing. And have no even touched another game. I'm prone to gamers ADD most of the time, but this game hsa kept my full attention!

Please take a note that I didn't play any social-oriented MMOs before apart from Lord of the Rings: Online (2008-2015), which has a lot of it.\n\nFirst impression - it's hell of a buggy and the graphics are outdated. Missing textures, low-poly models and such can be a pain, yes. And animations? While some are great (like moving with the weapon unholstered) some, well, are not. Clipping body parts, etc.\n\nThen you notice there is no such thing as exp and levels. Yes, it's a MMORPG without levels and experience grind - it's about roleplaying. It's what RPGs once were.\n\n*Some seasoned gamer sensitive emotions skipped*\n\nThen you see social content - dancing, storytelling, pickpocketing, crafting... Crafting. It is even more complicated than the EVE Online crafting, which is sort of an achievement. But it's also entertaining as hell to the ones like me.\n\nThen you see combat and cry over the outdated effects. Those need some hard work, but will certainly make a do for now. Bugged corpses can freak out some sensitive people though.\n\nThen you see towards the end of the Tutorial... And OH IT'S ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MORNING ALREADY!\n\nWould rate 8/10 for everyone enjoyed KotOR.\n","August 30, 2015","true","11.2"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","23","26","3","0"

PvP is entirely optional with much of the world being completely protected from it and players being able to progress entirely without ever getting involved in PvP." = PvP is not shoved down your throat by force and the game has enough actual continent, mechanics, co-op, thing to do other then, community, and etc., so that a COD PvP doesn't need to be there for the game not to suck @$$!  This sold me on the SPOT!!!\n\nHuge fan of SWG Pre-CU not just Pre-NGE both updates killed SWG for me and my guild of over 50 people! Have been playing this with a friend and love it so far!  Yes it's Alpha so there's going to be major performance issues and bugs. Lots of content will be add probably after a while as the game engine and current systems are ironed out and optimized.  Have to tell you the feel of this game is simply amazing! The crafting system is perfect - I hope they make it more complex as this isn't a game for 4 year-olds!  The combat is sweet and the ability to switch on the fly (middle mouse button) between FPS and RPG mode is really sweet!

It has so much, and what is best is that you don't feel limited. You aren't a "class". I can spend time fishing with buddies, each of us working on our skill, then I can go off hunting.\n\nThe game has no skill cap, but rather has diminishing returns on the odds of getting a skill up. So the long term players will be better, but that gap means less as you get higher up.\n\nThe crafting is insane, basically you can't make things from start to finish, well you can, but it won't turn out well. Each item made is often used in another process to make something else. Each step of the process takes into account the crafters skill with that specific receipe. This means you can be awesome at making batteries, but horrible at refining ore.\n\nThis means you can work a niche. I have met people who are basically only doing a few items, and they made good money.\n\nThe bard buffs (dancing) seem nice.\n\nI recommend this game to people who don't like class systesm, want a very niche type crafting system, and more or less just someone who doesn't want to feel like they wasted time by helping a friend.","February 22, 2015","true","37.1"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"

I played SWG for several years and have been looking for another game with a meaningful crafting system ..well here it is. The game is still in Alpha and things are being tested and improved each day, but as it is the game is very playable.\n\nThe Devs listen and are willing to pull ideas from the player community, which is a refreshing change from oher games. They often can be seen on the servers working with the testers or trying out a new idea.\n\nSome will say that crafting is complicated, well good, I was getting tired of item one, item two, and we all have the same old Uber Sword of Death as everyone else. With Repop the magic is in the fittings that are added to your weapons and armor, and even your abilities.\n\nWith high skill caps(6K to Master) and diminishing returns, you are not gonna get to "end game" any time soon. Also you can "Master" any or all of the skills as you choose ..be it Rifles, Melee or Hand to hand ....T.K.M anyone?\n\nPvE so far has been good either solo or in a group, the mobs range from Fodder to Boss levels, you can avoid the really nasty ones if your smart and gain survival skills or bring in a group and do some damage. The Den system will over time spawn other dens in an area and makes for a really challenging time to clear them out.\n\nMany missions are generated by the area you are in and influenced by your skills, so you may be out in "the boonies" and find a mission tailored just to you.\n\nPvP, well I have not tested it much, I hear a lot of chatter about it, but I see very few in the Contested Lands ...I suppose they are all scared of my uberness with stealth and a rifle.

The tutorial gives you the very basics of gameplay and then you're left to explore and learn the depth of this beautiful game.\n\nThe developers really spent time developing the complex systems instead of story. They are working to provide a complete sandbox that will allow you to adventure the way you want to; logger, miner, fisherman, flower picker, looter, weaponsmith, droidsmith, vehicle engineer, armorsmith, creature tamer, rifleman, hangun enthusiast, unarmed combatant, blunt weapons expert, dance, storyteller, and many many more.\n\nIf you get lost, just ask someone around you (or in General chat) a few questions. This is a social game. Don't be afraid to be social. Some believe that games should be centered around the social and community aspects; these guys nailed. I can forsee a day when the cantina of a player city is filled up with individuals wanting to get buffed before a large PVP battle.\n\nIf you're looking for a complete and finished product, you may want to let this cook some more; but if you'd like to jump ahead of the rest and understand the complexity of the game before everyone else, BUY IT NOW!!!","December 25, 2014","true","50.4"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","26","32","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mezameta/recommended/322300/","Mezameta","MezametaFox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mezameta/","589 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you like Star Wars :Galaxies you would love this, its basicly the same thing just...well just more amazing! Great game so far, ran into very few bugs as an alpha game.\n\nNow im updating this since i have the time,\n\nThere are lots of neat features that alot of players from SW:G would see.\n\nSkills: This is the primary element of the game, Skills progress as you play. The more you shoot Automatic weaponry, The more it goes up. The more you harvest Plants the more your Flora skill goes up, The more you craft weaponry, ect. This makes the game more time consuming yes, but at the same time you do not have to put a full 12 hours of gameplay to progress, For instance if you only have 2 hours a day to game you can still get to do things others do, Granted it will take you longer than someone who spends 12-18 hours a-day but still you can do it too with no restrictions other than your time.\n\nGameplay: This element of the game can be played majority in two ways, RPG mode; Simple understanding, Movement keys work and you use your mouse and keyboard to play like you would in World of Warcraft.[ Not comparing just saying that you use number keys to use skills and what not]\nSo basicly your standard MMO controls almost with key differnces that are easily seen when you play.\nAction Mode: This mode is my personal fav when it comes to combat. This mode turns the game into a Fake shooter, You aim with the mouse you get a crosshair and you attack with your left and right mouse buttons. There are ALOT of bonuses to this, If using guns you can AIM and hit Certain areas dealing more or less damage. making combat more fast pace you can still use # keys for skills, The only thing that changes ins the control scheme.\n\nSo i use RPG mode for everything else but combat mostly. If i feel lazy i will use RPG to attack. In RPG mode damage is mostly chest as spread is wider in RPG mode with guns. (This as if firing a gun from the hip its more inaccurate yeah?)\n\nSandbox Features: These features plays a major role later on, I have yet to buy one i am working on my offical character now but with these features you can do several things, so far what i can tell there are going to be Three memberships which are all going to be a ONETIME PAYMENT, Silver, Gold, Plat. Gold and Plat can both make towns/cities while plat will get access to Nation. Not sure as this is Early Access so i do not know the Release prices. Nations are part of the Sandbox features as this makes you a Rouge faction, This is a playermade faction. (Sorta like guilds) Now i know what everyone is thinking. "OH GREAT I HAVE TO PAY REAL CASH TO HAVE A GUILD" You may have to MAKE ONE, but joining a nation that exist is going to be the better option early on, as a Nation your going to have alot more problems. Such as the old faction likly to start hating you more. (You deserted what'cha expect Cake and cookies? This aint no girl scout army) You will be able to make houses with out needing to pay at all. housing will let you do several things, Craft, Party, Live. housing lets you place Crafting devices, Decorate, Invite your friends over and entertain them and ect. so this is one of the fun features. No info on towns/cities yet.\n\nNo combat needed: This is added to the game where you do not ever need to swing a sword, Fist,shoot a gun ever. You can do all the crafting and everything not involing combat if thats what you want with out ever equiping weapons.\n\nNow onto the Cons i see of this game.\n\nGrindy!: This game is grindy beyond grindy. Skills require you to use that skill stuff to advance it.\n\nLengthy: This game needs people who are Dedicated to playing when they can, Otherwise you wasted your time even looking at the game, But if you think you would like it give it a try but make sure your willing to try to put time and effort into the game.\n\nSlow: This game is not going to let you max your skills in a week, a month, or likely in a year, If you were to focus on one skill it would likely take you six months to max it out and from what ive heard, the skills max out at 60,000 points, and you gain your skill one point at a time.\n\nAlpha: This game being in alpha is a Con unto its self, its a great game so, if your not willing to support and report bugs and such, Dont even bother with the game IT IS NOT COMPLETE!\n\nHuge amount of skills: Over 75 different skills to use, and you can use em all. But to master EVERY skill would take even the most constant gamer  years to do so. Its like Eve online They do not go easy on you.\n\nThe pros of the game are a smaller list but more impactful.\n\nNice Community: The community is nice and helpful, there is always someone there to help you.\n\nGreat gameplay: the gameplay is amazing and the Random gen quests dont stop, Always something to do.\n\nAmazing stability: There are so few game breaking bugs as far as i can tell, Ive ran into the minor/annoying bugs and a few Quest stoppers. But for this game being in alpha its great. Never crashed once.","February 9, 2015","true","71.2"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

I've never felt more free in an MMORPG than I have with The Repopulation, you can do weapon crafting, armor crafting, fishing, mining, log gathering, plenty of combat skills, plenty of generated quests (and I didn't even scratch the surface with this).  Don't expect some half-♥♥♥♥♥ cookie cutter "A to B" quest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nYou don't even have to do quests as a matter of fact. You could just gain experience doing other things. You will get sent quests via ingame mail and you can choose whether or not to do them. They also give you quests based on what you like to do, so let's say you only choose quests that have to do with crafting: The game will realize this and send you similar types of quests. There are also "Engagements" which are basically public missions.\nOkay, now that I got that out of the way here are some of the pros and cons in my opinion:\n\nPROS\n\n+An ACTUAL sandbox mmorpg\n+Tons of things to do\n+ An in-depth crafting system\n+ Feels like SWG\n+ Nice soundtrack\n+ Faction PVP system, where you have the option to go rogue and make your own nation\n+ Caters to both PVE & PVP play styles.\n+ Over 75 different skills to master\n\nCONS\n- (CURRENTLY) In late Alpha, so there are quite a few bugs (Disregard this con once the game comes out)\n- Crafting may be too complicated for some\n- If you're used to having an arrow guiding you all the time, you may have trouble navigating.\n-  There will be a character wipe before launch (It's more of a warning to those who want to buy into early access but don't want to do their character over again)\n\n\nIf you want true freedom in a Sandbox MMORPG with tons of quests, lots of skills to master, alliances to forge, nations to create, cities to build, then I would highly recommend this game to you.","April 9, 2015","true","31.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

Want to switch later on? Sure, just start doing it, thers no limit as to how many skills of professions you can learn. Personally a perfer mining along with some simple hunting.\n\nYou remember Project Entropia (later on Entropia Universe)? This game is much similar to it, crafting is way more advanced and challenging, but mining isn't and thats maybe something which has to change, there was many miners in PE and the way you mined there is something that beats WOW-mining style any day of the week. Who wants braindead mouse clicking on a pixelrock? Not me. Im crossing my fingers for devs to look at different opportunities.\n\nI'll clearly recommend this game to anyone interested in getting involved in the development of a game and leaning the game early on. It's far from launchable and new content along with fixes are added all the time. The potential of this game is pretty much limitless and if done correctly this game has the potential to be a very good game for many years to come.\n\nKeep in mind tho, game will be F2P, what this means for server cost vs income per player is to early to tell, but thers no doubt that as I predicted some years back, F2P game are here to stay. But they also bring with them new challenges and in my eyes there havent been that many "successfull" F2P games, atleast which did apply to me.\n\nLooking at the current state, my best guess is that the game is about a year away from releasing.","February 12, 2015","true","221.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","2"

Leaving a review of an alpha game is kind of tough so this will be more of a first impression than anything else.   I’m a crafter, so this review will come from that standpoint.\nThere is definitely a resemblance to SWG and Ultima online when you play this.  It’s a game where the crafting actually matters.  If you want to run dungeons to get uber gear this isn’t the game for you.  If you want to be known on the server for being able to craft some of the most sought after items then you will have a home here.\n\nThe crafting is immense and can take some time to get into.   Most items need many components to craft.  The components come from several branches of crafting.  You can learn them all but it takes time to raise your skill.  Some of the items you can craft are:\n\nRobots (pets)\nGenetically Engineered Animals (pets)\nImplants\nHarvesters (mineral, wood, water and so on)\nHousing Items\nWeapon and Armor Fittings\nVehicles\nAnd many, many more items.\n\nThe crafting can be difficult to understand at times but the community is great help.  After about a week I was able to make my first robots.  There is a work order system so if you need mats you can request them there.  There is also the ability to have your own shop merchant at your house or in the city if you belong to a player nation that has built a city.\n\nThere will be nation vs. nation pvp and city sieges (Mechs).  There will be hardcore and standard servers.\nAbilities include pet taming and vet skills (You can raise a mount).  You can be an entertainer or diplomat.   There is no class system, you only limited by the skills you pick up (and you can get them all).\n\nThere is definitely a lot more to cover but I haven’t gotten into much more yet.  I’ve got about 90 hours in and feel that I have barely scratched the surface.\n\nIf you enjoyed SWG and games like Dark Age of Camelot this game is probably for you...","April 10, 2015","true","151.8"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

It has it's fun elements, but the devs don't appear to understand what a sandbox game actually represents. While the game nominally supports multiple play styles, in practice the devs design the systems to force players into a very limited set of choices. It's not really a sandbox, it's an open world game with a permanently broken crafting system and a lot of missions.\n\nThe more systems you have in a game, the more choices you should feel like you have. Instead, in Repop, so many of the systems they added are gated behind strict controls that it limits choice. The dev team has a few inflexible ideas on how the game "should" be played and they don't seem trust their future player base, so players end up with only a few inflexible options.\n\nOne of the biggest draws of the old-school sandbox games Repop is supposed to be emulating is that the players were allowed a lot of latitude in what they did. That latitude is not here.\n\nA lot of fuss is made over the crafting system. Crafting has a lot of pieces and an obtuse interface, so it's easy to mistake it for a deep and interesting system. It's _confusing_, but it's not at all deep. After figuring it out, it becomes clear that it's messy and shallow and requires very little thought. Given the same pile of ingredients, a "smart" player and a "stupid" player will make exactly the same items. I would much prefer a system that allowed for intelligent decision-making on the part of the players.\n\nThe materials chain has been designed so that all but one-fifth to two-fifths of the in-game production is useless. Most resources are useless. Most items you can create are useless. Despite designing the harvesting and crafting this way there's no system to constructively absorb all the useless cruft.\n\nThe economy is only partially player-driven. Having figured out fairly early in the process that they were too ambitious with the crafting system, the devs integrated inexpensive vendors and common loot drops of key items that are too complex or too boring to be supplied entirely by players. Have fun slaving away clicking thousands of times to skill up making circuit boards or copper wires that can be looted off any NPC human opponent, just so you can be a provider of the high-quality versions.\n\nLore and back story is frankly...stupid. Even the most loyal players make fun of the lore on the forums. Not surprisingly, the lore is never discussed in interviews other than to say it's an original universe.\n\nAt the time I'm writing this combat is very uneven, but it has gone through a few balance passes and there's always hope they'll get something better. Right now it's almost as bad a joke as the lore.\n\nThe systems have been pulled from older popular MMO's with very little thought of how they fit together. Like Star Wars Galaxies? You'll find creature handlers, imagine designers, and entertainers. The skill system has been lifted from Ultima Online. The siege system was borrowed from somewhere else. Endless re-cloning and some of the market mechanics come from Eve Online. Because the dev team is trying to recreate so many different games at once but have skipped the planning stage where they consider how the different systems inform the world, nothing fits together. It's just like the crafting..a lot of overly complicated or broken systems shimmed together with vendors and patches.\n\nIf you're wiling to ride their rails, the game can be fun. If you want an old-school sandbox experience, I would look elsewhere.","June 9, 2015","false","171.0"," 78 of 124 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","78","124","4","18"

The extra 5 points is for the fact that with all it's greatness it's still in early access beta which is impressive.  Most alpha's I enter always end up with the game being unplayable whereas Repop is not.  Keep in mind there is bugs, and stuff going haywire from time to time but the bug reporting system in game and on the forums are constantly watched, there's even GM's in game pretty much 24hours a day for in game help and most of the time the GM's have your problem fixed without you even needing to leave the game.\n\nI definately suggest you drop all the games your playing and get this game but before you do I have a few tips for starting out.\n\nREPOP is not your traditional "handholding" rpg, you are not guided to your next step.  it's more of a here's what you need to survive , and ya get kicked out the door.   Some people find this frustrating others love it the best way to look at it I think is to think of it this way, say you get your memory wiped and get dropped off in a different country where nobody knows you what do you do? Well ya don't just sit there and whine about it you get off your but and do what you can to survive, make money, and work your way up the ladder, well that's Repop.\n\nWhen you first get into the game after you created your character and everything you will be put into the tutorial area.  This area is where you will learn the basics of playing this game.  In most MMO's gamers generally just click through the chatting and use the mission tracker and map to do the quests this technique might work well in other games but DO NOT click through,  read everything you can , absorb all the information given to you in the tutorial zone because if you don't you'll spend hours out in the real world going "How the hell" and spend more time figuring it out that it would've taken you to listen to the trainer.\n\nAlong with the fact that this game is decades ahead of any other game I've played (which is a lot) in terms of systems, features and game mechanics it's definately a must buy and the community of players repop has drawn in are an amazing bunch, they are helpful, active, dedicated , and understand the importance of community and ultimately it's that aspect that makes or breaks a game.\n\nRepopulation is amazing definately worth every penny the Devs, Community , support and GM's are the best their is and really dedicated to bringing the best experience to all of us","April 3, 2015","true","170.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

TRP is sandbox, not a themepark.\n\n***THE REPOPULATION IS A SANDBOX, NOT A THEMEPARK***\n\nYou set your goals and you achieve them. Simply leveling up skills for the sake of leveling is meaningless in this game.  It's what you can contribute that matters.\n\nA lot of player's first mistake is assuming that the game revolves around your character; it doesn't. There's no hero's journey here. TRP revolves around real, tangible accomplishments.\n\nLast night my nation, the 47th Legion, found a city plot and began construction of our base. That base means 1,000x more than my personal character achieving grand master in rifle skill. In a sandbox like TRP the character progression is completely ancillary to server accomplishments. This is a game about learning where materials are, how to refine or manufacture awesome stuff, finding a patch of dirt to call yours, taking said patch of dirt away from people you don't like, exploring, building your brand and/or businesses, building a community, et cetera.\n\nIn TRP you actually have to accomplish something that matters.  There's no race to max level, there's no instanced raid progression, there's no gear treadmill; you just go out into the world and make your way however you can.\n\nIf you want some real freedom in an MMO for once try out TRP.

Having said that i have had a few hours on to try it out so here goes. Alot of people are comparing it to SWG i played SWG from beginning to end and in my honest opinion...not even close yes entertainer and popping down harvies is abit like it, but this game blows SWG away the combat and game mechanics are much more like entropia universe tbh except you dont have to pay real cash for items like ammo etc . Dont get me wrong i played entrpoia universe for a long time as well and spent alot of money also and is a very good game :/ This has clean well worked graphics (carnt understand the reviews i read about combat either i found it to be really good). You will find that there is so much to do and learn you wont be just in it for an hour but weeks of making the perfect character, Im a scout at heart and so ive been checking out the pet system which is really good, stealth again nice :) harvesting i could go on with that one for hours lol really good, ive only been crafting things that i need for healing my pets etc but the list for making things is near endless. the cities are not quite complete but are really well done. Entertainer just makes me pee myself yes that bit is abit like SWG only funnier and more entertaining. Ive not gone out laying harvies yet becoause of the issues ive had (getting logged out) so i havent had chance to do that side of things, hopefully these will be sorted soon (crosses fingers) but if like entropia this progresses to more planets space travel etc etc it will be the game to beat because evean at this stage it has me hooked and belive me im hard to please nowadays. The other question i see peaple ask is that is it worth paying for? Answer: in all honesty i dont think it should be free to play i think its worth paying for so in my opinion when completed it should be a buy to play people pay out all the time for shoddy hyped up games with no content and i think this game will hit the top of any game chart when finished. so if you can deal with a few bugs and getting cut off from time to time go get it. as i said the Devs are working hard and do talk to you and help you out its already a 10/10 for me and its got massive potential to get bigger and better. P.S i still play the SWGemu and Entropia Universe,,,,well until i get the full chat at this baby then the missis will probebly kick me out with my computer ;)","February 6, 2015","true","36.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

If you like old school MMOs and have gotten tired or burned out on more recent MMOs where your existance in the game is largely running errands for NPCs, this one could interest you.\n\nFair warning, there be a learning curve ahead.\n\nI've put 60 hours into the game at the time of writing and have so barely scratched the surface, it's laughable.  As I slowly learn more and more about the game, I start to like it more and more.  The crafting system is very complex and the different discilplines are tied together so one person cannot easily do everything, which forces cooperation within a group or buying materials from other players on the auction house.  It's not as simple as collect the resources, click a button, and poof I have my brown leggings of might!  The quality of the resource matters, how familiar your character is with the recipe matters, your character's skill in that profession matters.\n\nThere are no limits on what your character can do.  Mastering a "profession" requires an enormous amount of time so it really just comes down to what do you want to spend your time doing.  Want to learn how to tame and control animals?  Do it.  Want to craft weapons or armors?  Do it.  The more you do it, the better you get.  Tons of areas to level your character, you'll never reach the end.\n\nI could go on but I'll put it bluntly: This is a complex game that requires some time but if you invest. it becomes extremely rewarding.  It may be comforting to know the community is very friendly and helpful and GMs are active in General and Newbie chat to help you figure out the game.","March 31, 2015","true","136.8"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","16","16","2","1"

That said, it is still currently a very fun and amazing game already. There are constant updates and new content, and enough can't be said about the developers. They take the time to talk to the players on the forums, and you can tell how much this game means to them. You know that they will do the best job they are capable of.\n\nAs for the content, if you were a fan of UO or SWG you will absolutely love this. It is a skill-based open world. Even more than those games were. You don't have the hard skill caps they did, and so you have even more freedom. You can have as many different skills as you want to, so long as you put the work into them. Just pick up a weapon or tool and start using it. As you raise your skills you gain new abilities you can use, and you also are able to add more and better fittings to your weapons and armor. There is no ultra loot in this game. No magic sword of whoop-♥♥♥♥. Armor comes in three classes: light, medium, and heavy. Each has it's own advantages and disadvantages. But within each class the only difference between the types of armor are only cosmetic. They are all the same, just look different. To improve it you need to use the fittings. Weapons work the same. You can keep the same armor and weapons you get from character creation and be just as effective with your skills maxed. If you play with the mindset of the level-based WoW clone games of questing for the best loot gear and always chasing the level cap to have a chance to compete or have the advantage, you'll be lost. This game definitely has a huge learning curve, but once you get it you will have a blast.\n\nThere is also plenty to do in game, regardless of what your interests are. If you like to PvP there is that, with the game based around essentially a futuristic civil war, with an additional Rogue faction that is independent of the other two main factions. If you like to PvE there is plenty of things to hunt, and dungeons to go to. If you like to craft, the economy is very heavily player based with very few things able to be bought from NPCs. If you like to RP they are adding in plenty of features for that. They have entertainers that can provide buffs like in SWG. Diplomacy/intimidation skills that allow you to interact with NPCs. The player nations can build player cities. There are different types of player housing you can own. Or you can simply wander and explore the huge world. Basically any playstyle is represented. You can solo, join with a small group of friends, or be in a huge guild with lots of people. The community is great, very helpful and friendly. You aren't forced into anything. Some things may take longer, but just about anything is possible if you are willing to put in the effort.\n\nAgain, the game is not finished yet. There are still some problems and bugs, and a lot of content still to be added. I played Vanguard beta and launch, and this game feels much further along to me already. That doesn't mean it's done, though. I've been playing since December 2014, and just in that time it's amazing how much has been added and fixed. I can't wait to see the finished product. You can go on the forums and see everything that gets added for each update. Be prepared for a lot of reading, as it's a lot! And there are constant, regular updates.\n\nIf you are expecting to play a finished game, just hold on and wait. You will want to try this when it is released. If you are willing to play now and use the opportunity to play a fun game while helping the developers by finding bugs and learning how things will work so that you know what to do at release, then it is well worth the cost and I highly recommend this game.\n\nI played UO for nearly five years, and SWG for three. This is the game I've been looking for since.","July 9, 2015","true","112.1"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

If you can't handle that, wait until beta. Animations and a lot of visual things are, quite frankly, -terrible-. However, the gameplay is solid. There is so much to do, the map is already huge, and it looks like it can expand easily when the developers decide to. There's a potential to really find yourself a niche in the game's community where you can excel, which I think it my favourite part. Nobody can do -everything-, so whatever you choose to do, someone's going to need what you make. Some people are saying that there's too much for skills and crafting, but I say there can't be too much. The more there is, the more you can specialize, and the more you can come together as a community [or a nation!] to get things done and done well. I think nation building is going to be huge, with that kind of a mechanic, with leaders bringing people together and organizing their members to do what needs to be done for the betterment of their group, unlike other games where you don't -really- need anyone else to get by.\n\nJust got it a few days ago and I keep playing, but I'm still just poking around the main town and the couple maps out from it, just like someone else said. If you play, expect to start slow. I advise you ignore everything but the basics to start, get comfortable with the game mechanics, then slowly ease yourself into crafting something. I'm definitely going with Animal Handling for my main mastery!

Literally one of the only things I see holding this game back is the lack of a community. There are maybe 50 people on the US server that are online at a time, so it's hard for new players to get the proper support from others that they need. Not only that, but a lot of the game depends on player to player interactions, especially when it comes to crafting and the auction house, so it can be difficult for players who may want to play a non-combat role in the game to get the materials that they need. That's why I want to encourage everyone who enjoys this genre of mmo to support the development and buy into the alpha now.  Anyway, here's why the game is awesome:\n\n-Huge maps to explore, barely any instances at all! Nearly Seamless!!!\n-amazingly indepth crafting system.\n-leveling the right way! instead of your character having a base level, every single type of gear, weapon, armor, skill, you name it... has its own level that has to be leveled the good old fashioned way, by practicing it. Using a particular skill or item will level that specific thing, so if you shoot a lot of pistols you gain experience in pistol tactics, you use light armor you get light armor tactics, etc.\n- (this one is a pro and a con) Community dependant. It thrives when there is a huge player base, which it does not have at the moment. There are building plots, which allow for entire player built cities to be placed. There is so many different crafting skills to choose from and sooooo many different components needed to craft these different things that it makes it difficult when there aren't many crafting components for sale on the auction house.

As of now I am a noob with very little play time, however, as of right now, the review is a great "first glimpse" of what it's like, and a non biased look at the game.\n\nNote 2: Also remember.. This is Alpha, things are subject to change.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nWhen I first stepped into the The Repopulation, I won't lie. It didn't excite me. I was thinking "Oh great, another 40$ wasted on a well made video on steam that has nothing to do with how the game actually is"... I was wrong.. This game, honestly is a true RPG.\n\nThe graphics themselves are nothing amazing by any means, for those of you need decent and or awesome graphics.. this game isn't for you most likely. However, if you're a player who can look past that, and see the depth of game mechanics and the treasure trove under the surface. This is definetly a game to really look into it more closely if what you saw on the Steam page peaked your interest.\n\nThe Character Creator\n\nThe Character Creator or TCC for short isn't anything special. You get the usual choices, height, weight, customizing the face, etc. Atm It's pretty bulky as moving 1 slider will move another, and you end up having to move 4-5 sliders in little notches to really fine tune your characters look.\n\nHowever, as a plus you get to choose and customize its starting armor, which actually is alot more important than a  beginner may think ( They don't actually explain this too well in the tool tip when choosing, except vague things). As a tip.. When choosing your starting armor look and color, think of how you're going to play.\n\nIf you're gonna be a sniper, choose lighter equipment, if you're going to go head deep, choose heavier stuff. If you're ont going to fight, or be as passive as possible, choose nothing, or as light as possible. (A cook doesn't need heavy armor after all).\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nSince my over all game time atm is very little, what I will say right now before I start breaking up my Review in a day or so, is simply this. So far the game already has proven to be quite deep in mechanics.\n\nFor Instance.\n\nAs Stealth, leveling it up will unlock your ability to use Camoflauge, Disguises, disarm traps, and multitude of other things you'd think would be helpful for playing that style of character, (whether you want to be a sniper, spec ops, thief, assassin, or a window peeker). Yes, you can get disguises to change your look. Be that Spy... <3\n\nThere are even deep mechanics for socializing, such as dancing. Already in my short time of playing I met a player who, all they do.. is dance..\n\nBy dancing and raising a specific skill you unlock other dances, which both buff nearby players and NPCs, and can be linked and interlinked with other dances by other player, buffing the buffs even more. This can only be done in social area's; however, this player dances in their player made town, at the pub they created. Where other players can come in, socialize, and watch the dancers.. (who are real people). It's more of a fun social have fun, as the dancing is nothing more than clicking a few buttons, but.. MMO's are about socializing anyway right? It's a great way to kick back after roghing it out in the woods and fighting off other players from the other faction.\n\nYou can also setup camp, which opens a small temporary socializing area, allowing players to dance and have a good time out in the wilderness.\n\n\nThe NPCs themselves are very in depth. Most NPC's have an "Inquiry" button, when you click this you can type in another NPC's name you may be looking for, and if they are in a good mood, and they like you, they will tell you roughly where they are, or even mark them on your map, -IF- that NPC knows. Some may, some may not. Inquiring one NPC 30 ft away may result in a much better result in what you're looking for.\n\nIt doesn't stop there by any means however, you can also Inquire NPCs about new events in the area, or possible situations going on that you may be interested in.\n\nAs you complete MIssions, engangements, talk to NPCs in general, and raise your diplomacy skill(If you're going that way), read books, or inquire about various topics you will gain new bits of knowledge. These will open up additional questions with NPCs that you can ask about, which may result in learning backstory, or even opening a Mission or Assignment, or Oppertunities you'd otherwise not have gotten.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nTime Frame Matters\n\nUnlike most games out there, NPCs in this game have a schedule. They will close up shop at night, go home, sleep, and do things normal humans would. This even includes Quests. If you recieve a Quest from an NPC at their shop, and you return late at night, they'll probably be gone, and you'll need to wait until morning to hand it in.\n\nSome shady thief NPCs, or underworld characters only come out at night as well, so if you're one of those players who really wants to go in and be that dark alleyway skulking thief or killer, you'll definetly find some fun in this game, as the Underworld only comes out at night (Since you know, that makes sense, don't you just hate other games that put them out on the street in broad daylight??)\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Quests\n\nFrom what I've seen in the tutorial, and the time I've played, the quests really are tailored to how you play. Though there are NPCs who may give you their usual quest to anyone regardles of who they are, you will recieve quests via your PDF. These you can tailor to how you want to play. Whether that be Combat, Military, Crafting, Politics, Underworld, etc. You can choose which type Quests are randomly generated for you.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nI will be updating this Review as I play, so if you're still wondering how things are, want me to add anything to the Review, Please feel free to contact me, or write below. <3\n\n~Playing on Hudson Server~","December 30, 2014","true","8.5"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","33","47","0","0"

I'm still an extremely casual player, but can appreciate the complexity of an in-depth RPG as much as a hard-core RPG-er does.\n\nThat being said, you must buy this game NOW!\n\nFinding WoW way to played out?  FFXIV not complex enough for you?  Miss SWG?  Tired of waiting on "The New Graphic's Engine" for Anarchy Online?\n\nRepop is going to be the game for you.  The depth of the crafting is insane.  Literally... someone must have gone to Arkham, force fed speed to the inmates, and let them go all "Jackson Pollack" designing the relationship database for the crafting.\n\nLike to hunt?  Cool.  Just watch your six, because the little baby setlang in front of you is probably not that far away from a herd that will come and trample you into mush... all because you thought you'd be making some broth out of that little fella.  Silly you.\n\nPvE?  Got it.  PvP?  Got it.  Housing?  Got it.  Player Cities?  Got it.\n\nOh, should probably mention... it's a Sci-Fi environment.  So if you *are* a die hard WoW or FFXIV kind of player, and prefer fantasy over sci-fi, then you might not dig this game.  But really, the other pluses are so many, that if you can get past that one hurdle, you'll almost certainly love this game!\n\nRemember: still in ALPHA!

I've little interest in playing an Alpha and I am waiting for the game to progress a bit more before I really try to get into it.  I do not have much playtime on this game nor do I feel I will have a lot of playtime for months to come.\n\nThat said, I will get to it...\n\nThis game, has potential.  Some of the systems I seen in-game were pretty nice, such as the "find" system.  It takes some of the point + click out of the game and makes you use your noggin a bit.  The style, in-game, at this point is very rough, graphically, and the performance is the exact same way.  I have very low frame rates and there seems to be a constant lag.  Such is to be expected in Alpha while the game is being designed.\n\nThings which I hope will change...  The Dev's stated they are using SWG and Ultima Online as two of their sources for inspiration.  I was kind of disappointed looking at the maps.  SWG, IMO, was a very bright and vibrant game.  The graphics in this game gives a feeling of depression... everything is washed out... I think even Fallout 3 had a brighter and more vibrant world.  Also, the size of the maps were kind of disappointing.  I remember in SWG while looking for spots to set up harvesters, remember how the resources always changed locations, well, I recall in SWG running across the map for an hour sometimes, and still didn't reach the edge.  These maps, you can go side to side in 10 minutes (or less?)... a big let-down there.\n\nWhat I hope improves.  The latency issues and framerate, some better maps in both size and color (I doubt, but who knows), and an auto-attack for basic attacks, so you do not need to keep button mashing.  Also, the game lacks key bindings at this point for movement, so if you're like me and do not like to play with WASD, well, you're stuck with that, so enjoy!\n\nAgain, this is only my thoughts on the Alpha and I knew this was an unfinished product going in.  I will be checking back periodically to hopefully see vast improvements.  In the current state of the game, it's pretty buggy/laggy.  The nice thing is, the Dev's are on, you can usually see them chatting in-game while they are fixing stuff, so you know that there is active development.  I hope this game, 6-12 months from now, is something great!  If you have the cash to help fund it, go for it!  If you want something which is completed and you can fully enjoy, I'd say wait on this...","January 17, 2015","true","12.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","1"

Yea, you!  Get this game."  I will start out by saying that if you've ever played and liked Star Wars Galaxies, this game will fill the gaping wound that Sony Online left in your life.  'nuff said, there.  If you liked SWG then get this game.\n\nFor everyone that has not played SWG, a bit of a gameplay walkthrough.  The game starts out very well for an alpha MMO, with a fully featured newbie area and tutorials enough to give you a really good foundation of all the skills a new player may want to play with.  You get basic training in several weapon types for free and the ability to spend training credits on up to three others, with the ability to choose from any weapon type the game has to offer. You also get basic crafting tutorials that give you enough of an idea how the surprisingly complex crafting system works to get you on your feet, and gives you a preview of how the really complex things will work once you get that far.  You are also introduced to Entertaining, for providing temporary buffs to allies; Stealth and Rouge-like options, like trap detection and disarming; Animal Taming and Robotic pets; and Medical skills.  And as you play through the tutorial area you get a feel for just how much more there is to play with as you progress with the game.  With dozens of different skills across 6 different catagories.  Even with the comprehensive tutorials, the game is overwhelming at first.  This game has a LOT of mechanics, although they are not so bad that they get in your way.\n\nI definitely recommend it for anyone that's tired of the cookie cutter WoW clones that have been coming out for the last few years.

Especially one as large a scale as TR is trying to be.  It's basically trying to be the next Star Wars Galaxies pre-NGE.\n\nIt's combat is clunky.  It's graphics are primitive.  The only thing it has going for it right now is the crafting system, which is very expansive.  I suppose the skill system is pretty nice as well, with skills going up to 6000.  It'll take you a LONG time to get every skill to that.  So the reward for grinding is there.\n\nRight now the dev is unable to update the game due to the host of the Hero Cloud service going bankrupt.  I dont know the whole story.  But they need a new donor or sponsor before they can re-open the service.  Why the dev's picked the Hero Engine is beyond me.  I think it's terrible for optimization.  I realize it is expensive to make an MMO.  And for a company making their first game, I do no think an MMO is the first project they should undertake.  So for that reason, I guess the Hero Cloud is cheaper to host then their own servers.  But since that happened, the devs cannont update TR.  You'll notice not a single update since September.\n\nAt least the dev lead JC  removed the game for sale until they resolve this issue.  Just don't expect an update until early next year.  Hopefully the devs are still working on this in the mean time and will release 3-4 huge updates all at once.\n\nI would say pass for now but you can't even buy the game so...sure, it's a thumbs up for now.","December 5, 2015","true","26.4"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","8"

The combat feels solid. Movement feel solid. Mounts feel solid. Massive open world. Very minimal instancing. 3 Faction PVP. Deep crafting system. Lots of juicy skills to master. Dynamic / public quests. Rich loot system. Player housing and world building. Melee and ranged classes. Vehicle crafting and much more you'd expect from a modern sci-fi sandbox. The world actually feels alive and the lore is intriguing. Many Sandbox devs completely skimp on this area of development. In my opinion, a world without solid lore isn't a world i want to be in.\n\nThe game feels challenging with lots of paths worth investing in, as opposed to the multitude of games out there masquerading as MMORPG's when in reality they are nothing but a closed series of hoops to jump through while having your hand lead by the developers. Obviously it is in Early Access, it has some clunkiness to the interface and crafting in particular needs some refining, especially since it will play such an integral part to the game. You will need to work with other players in order to achieve big things as many of the craftable items require multiple components from multiple disciplines which would simply take too long to master alone. Good thing you can open up shop and sell your wares then huh?\n\nIt's been described as SWG meets UO (but i never played UO), to me its SWG meets Earthrise and i can't wait to get into the main release.","August 11, 2015","true","23.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

I keep seeing notes that this is the same engine as SWTOR, but movement and player view in SWTOR felt a lot more smooth as I recall; hopefully this too will improve with that final coat of polish.\n\nThe entire game seems overly complicated and confusing.  Unable to speak with NPCs, a considerable amount of time was spent looking over the controls and keybinds; a Twitch viewer noted that it looked to be "rocket science."  Obviously as the development team advances with the project things like control systems and the tutorials that introduce you to them will also improve, at least I hope so.  Next go at this title I will have to take a great deal of time to customize all of my keybinds and ensure there are not conflicts with hotkeys for Steam, TeamSpeak and Broadcasting softwares; being able to easily toggle this action mode and speak with NPCs instead of no-clip punching them would be a drastic improvement.  Even when I've gotten the hang of it, I imagine I will still hate these systems.  If it is not on the long term to-do list, user needs options in menu for setting this, audio and video before joining game servers; I only seemed to be able to access this once I was already in the game world.\n\nI will come back to this title for the same reason I bought in, the old school sandbox MMO namedrops.  However, in its current state, I cannot stress enough that you should probably not buy into this game.  Unless you're already one of the fanboys down voting this review, you'll probably feel the tinge of buyer's remorse unless you wait and watch.  If I could have read a single negative review instead of all positve, "If you loved SWG, buy this now," I would have excitedly followed the title awhile longer and spent my holiday funds on something else.","December 23, 2014","false","4.0"," 148 of 254 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","148","254","3","18"

According to their website they have run into an issue with their hosting company with regards to new account creation. They have completely suspended development and shut down the servers with no ETA as to when business would resume. They promise that they're going to continue to develop the game and bob loblaw. My review which i wrote a long time ago stated that I felt that the development team was inept. From the graphics, to the implementation, the audio, and everything else it was just a really bad game. While they do say that they aren't abandoning the game, I do believe this is another sign of their ineptitude. Don't buy this game if it goes on sale again. It's really bad.\n\nI have popped in now and again over the past year or so and I obviously stay current with the news of the game. I can once again state with confidence that this game is NOT going anywhere. Another poorly fleshed out MMO that will see it's demise likely before it even begins. Stay away.\n\n\nThis game is ugly, clunky, confusing, repetitive, bug riddled, and boring. I'm generally willing to overlook issues that others are not. But man, this game gives me a headache. Not because it's hard, because it isn't - but the graphics, UI, map, and minimap are just all so poorly implemented that it literally makes my head throb in pain.\n\nThe Audio is awful. I work in the audio industry and i'd be embarrassed if this were my sound design work. The quality of the sound effects are bad. The music flutters in the game and needs to be muted.\n\nThe graphics in this game are mixed. The 3D player art is really nice. Beyond that it's between bad and laughable. People argue that it's early access or alpha so graphics shouldn't be considered. I think those people are wrong as i've been a part of a ton of alpha's and early access games where the grahpics showed promise. What i'm looking at is certainly not representative of the final product but it is representative of the art teams talent. In this case i'd say the art team is not talented.\n\nThe UI consists of a ton of menu diving. Little boxes with tabs that extend out of site. I'm forced to open little windows and click a little arrow key to get to the tab I need which consumes quite a bit of\ntime. These information menu's are things that you need to access constantly. It becomes annoying and adds to the tediousness of this game. Keep in mind that i'm a 10 year Eve vet. People jokingly refer to Eve as "world of spreadsheets"... so I can deal with data. I imagine that these things will be refined over time.\n\nThe minimap is a tiny little circle that shows little detail in the terrain. NPC's, monsters, players, quest items are little tiny dots. They are everywhere and it needs a lot of improving. In all honesty it should be scrapped. Around the minimap you have little yellow arrows that tell you which directions to go for quests you have. Only problem is that they blend in with the terrain or with some of the icons around\nthe minimap so you can't even see them. Literally they disappear. I expect this is something that will be changed shortly cause right now it's just a clusterf**k of dots.\n\nThe map itself is a little more useful. By pressing M you get a little map window, that's notexpandable, that shows you your immediate surroundings. I had complained that the map was terrible because it\ndidn't scroll. Someone from the development team commented on my review that by pressing "Shift-M" you get a scrolling map. He was correct but the map is still bad. It's a tinly little box, that doesn't appear to expand, that's about 1/8th the size of your screen. Even if it did expand it shows very little detail, is ugly, and causes my framerate to drop very low.\n\nThe combat is clunky and the way it's implemented I basically can't use any of my skills. You have to right click your target to shoot and left click items on your bar to activate them. Maybe i'm missing something but that's not my fault. This games just so clunky and confusing, including the tutorial, that it's not obvious in any way. I have found that by assigning some of my abilites to extra mouse buttons is really the only way to go. For people who don't have a fancy mouse with extra buttons then i'd say that you'll be at a distinct disadvantage compared to those that do. Also the combat is not fun or challenging. Combat consists of right clicking on your target.\n\nThe gameplay is very repetitive. Questing is like WoW. Though you receive quests through an email system the meat of the quests are the same. Go to location X, gather resource Y, deliver to NPC Z. Or Kill 8 of these and return to NPC X. Or pick up package at NPC X and deliver to NPC Z. That's fine because that's not really what this game is about. However, it adds to the repetitive feeling of this game.\n\nResource gathering thus far has consisted of running out of the town, finding nodes which are clustered by the dozens in specific areas, and harvesting one after another after another after another. There is no real danger, there is no real challenge, and it's very repetitive. From what i've experienced thus far it's completely a solo activity.\n\nCrafting has been much of the same experience. You can only craft at a "crafting station". These are situated inside cities and you generally find a number of people all huddled around it. You find the item you want to craft in your recipe book, place items in window, and you get your crafted item. There is a fairly deep crafting system that is somewhat rewarding. I think this is where a lot of the potential in this game lies. I've been following the advice of the tutorial and sticking with one profession. Generally that's the right thing to do in all MMO's but I find the process of gathering resources in the game extremely boring. I find that crafting in this game is extremely boring. This does not appeal to me though in other games I enjoy carebear acitivities.\n\nHopefully more people read the negative reviews and think twice. I bought this game because of the positive reviews and the pretty pictures. BIG MISTAKE. I understand that hardcore SWG fans have been waiting for this game for a while. I'm glad that they have a new home. I am not one of the SWG refugees.\n\nYes, it's alpha and yes the developers have intentions of improving this game. Well they better because as it sits now it's a bad game. So many good games out there and in my library. This game isn't one of them.\n\nIf you're on the fence about this game my advice would be to just wait and see. Watch the lets play videos as they surface and follow the development and updates as they occur.\n\nI for one am very excited about the "potential" of this game. I don't feel like I was ripped off or that I wasted my money. This is an ambitious project. Considering that this game was made thus far by a small development team and very limted funds (like less than 100k i'm being told) it is quite impressive. That being said, when you fork over your 35 bucks you're doing it in good faith that the developer is going to do something positive with it. As it sits right now it's not fun and many others will share my feelings.\n\nSorry if the sensitive gamers were offended by my review. I'm just offering my experience and opinion. My opinion is not wrong and neither is yours!

It's a skill based advancement system, where you obtain skill points through missions or by using the skills. New skills are available by buying the books from NPCs. The crafting system looks "deep," which means complicated; but, much like in SWG(you're going to see that a lot), this is not needlessly so. Most gear will be crafted by other players, and the key elements for modifying stats are fittings, which are modular modifications that you put into your armor or weapons. The tutorial is raw, and consists of popping up a database page describing what to do. Read these. Once you finisht the tutorial you will have several skills and pieces of equipment for your future endeavors.\n\nI have not gotten into too much of the main story missions, and I think you may need to build up some reputation before you get access to the lore. You do get missions in your mailbox regularly, and it is made clear in the tutorial that you don't have to do them all. Once I entered Freedomtown I received 4 messages with missions very quickly.\n\nGraphics are alright for this level of development, of course they will be expected to improve after what is an Alpha.5 build. My biggest problem is that the client keeps crashing to desktop, and apparently this is an issue for many other players. It is not totally unexpected, but I WANT TO PLAY. WAH.\n\nAll that aside, I am looking forward to getting into the gathering and crafting. Finding some materials was not as difficult as in SWG, and once you find a node you have the option to enhance the node or the area to improve the quality of the materials you take. Also, various quality materials stack, so you can have F0 all the way up to A10 quality of a commodity all in one stack. Oh yes, you can break them up later. So yes, I think this will be a good one, all the proper elements are in place. Sometimes you just have to sack up, roll a hard 6, show up and see what happens. This should be pretty good.","January 8, 2015","true","9.5"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

Well I use the word perfected very loosely of course but what it comes down to is that everything the dev's have done so far on this game have been great, there hasn't been a lot of updates to it as of late but in my honest opinion this game is still well worth funding the project with its small price tag.\n\nIf you like open world games that don't tell you "You have to do these missions as your "storyline" then this game is perfect. On the other hand, most games that try to give you freedom end up with to much hassel trying to figure out what you are supposed to do, with this game you get most missions via mail that you can accept on the fly, out killing bandits? Oh look someone who wants them dead just noticed you are and mailed you a job to kill more of them for them, love it.\n\nOver all its a well rounded game already though progression is extreemely slow at the moment for some skills like stealth, it is made up for by what the game does well, and that is letting you do your thing, no levels, no restrictions, no "you cant have this skill with that skill" Want to do it all? well good luck with that but you tottaly can!","March 13, 2015","true","14.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I would not say this game is for everyone, but if it is for you, you'll love it.\n\nThe way they go about skills is unique to modern MMO's. You can be a melee'r with a sheild who stealths gets some distance pull a gun out and blast on your enemys from afar if you so wish. Or maybe you want to be a healer who buffs has a sheild with 3 pets defending you and heck, why not throw in the stealth skill while you're at it. (I like stealth) Maybe you just want to dance and talk in chat, the choice is yours. Mix and match as you please. The map is big and they keep adding more areas and points of interest. There are 3 ways to sell or buy items involving other players. 1.) Player venders 2.) Work orders 3.) Auction House. These 3 ways leave an opening to become a master of the economy if you want to. Crafting is deep to say the least but I'm not much of a crafter so I won't get into that but every item you can use is made by other players, if it's high quality. The community is helpful most of the time, people want the community to learn the game and keep playing it.  The armors are shells meaning you can wear what you want and put fitting in them to increase your stats, same with the guns. If you find a look you like keep it as long as you like just change the fittings in and out. There's player citys and in later updates seige warfare (seigeing has been disabled for now) and remeber player citys have peices made by other players as well as the seige weapons. Mastering skills can take some time so don't expect to jump in and be the master of stealth, healing, entertaining, construction, harvesting, buffing, animal handling, robotics, combat and more. It's best to pick a few that complement each other and level them. Heck even vehicle handling is a skill.  There are 73 skills (give or take) listed on their website[therepopulation.com] and one that isn't (that I know of) spirital arts. All 73 skills are broken up into 6 categories. Like I said mix and match.\n\nI play this game on a 4 year old laptop with an onboard graphics chipset. My CPU runs at 1.3ghz duel core. So when this game goes F2P expect alot of people to at the very least try it.  Although Be Warned! This game plans to do a server wipe once it is released. If you don't like the sound of that, just wait for it's release.","March 13, 2015","true","127.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

To be honest this is pretty mich just like SWG with the ability Queue etc. The skill based combat etc. You have an action mode (more like NGE) or you can do the standard mode like original SWG with queues.\n\nYou can tame pets and the community is well knit and able to help with no issues, entertainers are buffers also! This can be done by any character because you learn the skills when you start playing along with medicine etc. The developers are constantly updating the game bi-weekly and they are great at it for being a Indi developer. I was originally iffy on purchasing this when I first saw it, I didn't like the way it looked, then watching the stream helped me make a better decision. The game was for me. I have been playing GW2, SWGEmu and Repopulation to get the comparisons out when it came to SWG and The Repopulation and they are quite close.\n\nSo if you were looking for an MMO that was similar to SWG Pre-Cu with a mix of NGE (based on preference) welcome home people!","January 11, 2015","true","21.8"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","22","30","0","2"

I have completed the initial tutorial for the game and am starting to progress through my chosen craft. Generally I prefer crafting, but do enjoy combat from time to time, so I went with Genetic Engineer. I supply my own Tissue and DNA samples which you get from harvesting animals, which need to be dead. I have dabbled into some of the other crafts and have quickly realized how intense the crafting in this game really is. It is very difficult to become your own supplier.\n\nFor instance, I can buy sterilizing agents(agent A), but I decide to craft them, so I determine which profession makes them. Turns out several, so I pick Chemistry, to make agent A, I need another item made with chemistry(agent B), as well as a raw resource, and an Acid(Agent C). So I go to make Agent B and find it requires another Raw resources and another agent from another skill(Agent D). For Agent C I need another craft skill, foraging, so I pick that up to find that I need a raw resource and more of Agent B. To make agent D I need A Raw resource, and who knows what else, so I just buy it. So to make a simple item, needed to make anything else in Genetic Engineering, I need 4 different raw materials, and 5 different crafting sessions, and that is with buying one refined item, which I need twice. I may still be missing a step, but to get those 4 different Raw materials, I need Foraging, Survival, Mining. I would also need a combat skill to be able to kill the creatures for some of those items. I guess if I wanted to keep it brief, I should not have mentioned the crafting system.\n\nThat said, it is a very well done system and it is exciting to see your work progress. I am ten hours in and have forgotten that there was no class selection, and the world feels very free and open, a much better feel for an mmo in my opinion. However, its not all sunshine and rainbows either. There are glitches, random crashes, graphical anomolies and everything else you would expect to find in a game. I have not knowingly joined a group(more on that later) or participated in PVP so I cannot speak on game balance. That said, it is definately worth the money, just remember you are basically buying a product that is still in Alpha. You are helping a startup to fund a brilliant idea and they almost always have a GM on to answer questions or help with bugs, which shows their commitment to making this game a success.\n\nI am still listing it as a con because it is hard to find but here is some good information for new players. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=362788661\n\n- Pros -\nAmazing crafting system\nEnjoyable combat\nGood Tutorial\nGreat Trade System\nComplex Skill Tree\nGM Support\n\n- Cons -\nLearning Curve (A manual would be nice, especially for the UI)\nAuto Group (realized I was in a group for the first time yesterday)\nGlitches (expected but a con none the less)","March 6, 2015","true","23.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","1"

I've tried a few now, but have always been disappointed.\n\nWhere do I start with TR? Well, I am optimistic that this game could develop into something special. That said, I've been burned enough by games to avoid being just a blind fanboi, so here's a few good and bad aspects as of right now:\n\nThe Bad\n\n1. Laggy and buggy, but not game breakingly so. It is an alpha, so that kind of comes with the territory.\n2. Steep learning curve. And I mean steep. Did I say steep?\n3. Tutorial was halfway helpful - probably just let chars learn all skills (particularly combat) without cost and then decide where they want to specialise. Aside from that, it was okay.\n4. Landscapes are kind of same-ey. Perhaps it's the colour palate?That said, I've not yet had the time to explore all that much of the map, so I could just be talking out of my ar$e.\n5. UI and pop ups all kind of blend into the same sapphiric miasma of eye-rapery. But since I still enjoy playing EVE Spreadsheets, this ain't too bad, I guess.\n6. The AH is a little confusing. I'm the first to acknowledge that I may have some sort of mild mental retardation when it comes to numbers, but I also shouldn't need an economics degree just to sell a vial of D3 alien goo. I think my anu$ leaked the first time I tried to use the AH. Ana.l leakage is a thing. If you don't believe me, look it up...at work. Or just try to use the AH. Ladies' choice.\n\nThe Good\n\n1. Steep learning curve. Yup, this is also a good thing, because learning and building a char through trial and error is what invests us in the game. Goals, people, goals. Just go watch some how-to-play vids, and stop whining about difficulty...it's noooot a tumor!\n2. Skills. There's a lot of 'em. (In case you didn't pick up on it, I was understating. See what I did there?).\n3. Teaming up is a good thing. From doing public missions to sharing mats and products, being social will be essential here; while there'll be plenty of loner content to keep us Unabomber types clicking away until the early hours. Brrrr, my shed feels drafty.\n4. Devs have explicitly said this baby will never be P2W. Of course, that's what those f*cktards at Sony said about H1Z1 and see what happened there.....Smedleeeeeeeeeeey!!! Yet, I'm still hopeful with TR, because...\n5. Devs are helpful and responsive and obviously care about their baby.\n6. So much to do. If you're a blood thirsty, psychopathic monster, there's murderin' to do. If you're a carebare, hippy softc*ck, then maybe you can sit in the corner and be all crafty and sh*t.  I might even stroke your hair and coo gently.\n\nThe Ugly\n\n1. Character creation, although in depth, more often than not results in an unflattering outcome. So I'm one of those creepy dudes who likes to make female characters. Something to look at, right? And I try pretty hard to make them at least look partway bone-able, yeah? You feelin' me, Dog? But here....dayum! The current TR character graphics really, completely take away all of my horny. Fix that sh*t.\n\nSeriously, though, this one looks like it could be a good, even great, game. And if you're thinking about it, the advantage of getting in now is two-fold: you'll be an early part of, and co-conspirator to, a potentially great game (which you can then brag about in dulcet nerd-superior tones a few years from now), and you'll also to learn how it all works so you can dominate on release.\n\nHappy gaming, sentient space beings.","June 23, 2015","true","14.0"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","18","23","6","0"

They are going to use it as a bed to build the UE Repopulation off of, and are going to use the funds generated by Fragmented to keep development going. This does mean that it's going to be a while longer before the game finaly finished though. In the mean time we have another game which is FREE to those who have already purchased The Repopulation.\n\nAll in all the devs have been very open with the comunity about whats going on, and i feel that they are making the right decision going foward.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/recommended/322300/","Asvarduil","Asvarduil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/","46 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOnce upon a time, there was an authoritarian government called "One World, One Nation" that was totally not ripped off from a Sci-Fi movie/novel/whatever.  This government got totally spooked when an activist protested, and killed him.  This led to a rebellion, which led to an ongoing war, which forms the framing device for this MMORPG.  It sounds completely original, and I don't think anyone else has ever written any other MMO framing device that sounds like this.\n\n...\n\nSarcasm aside, "The Repopulation" is an old-school MMORPG.  You start off the game in a training facility, with the capacity to learn to use a bunch of skills.  After some (completely optional) primers, you're dumped in a huge, open world to do what you want, with other players - both of the opposing faction and your own - to account for in your plans at any time.\n\nSome Thoughts, Going In\nAs one of the generation whose first MMORPG was EverQuest, then later World of Warcraft, this sort of MMO is fascinating to me.  I don't venerate it, because it has problems I'll get into later (some of which are due to the fact the game is in Alpha and is receiving tweaks as I'm writing this.)  I do respect that the game maintains a mixture of standard MMORPG elements, like harvesting nodes, mobs, aggro-radii, world events, raid bosses, PvP, vehicles, housing, nigh-endless customization options, but without the themepark guidance so common in modern MMOs.\n\nSpeaking of, let's address the elephant in the room - as of this writing, this game is in Alpha.  You're paying $39.99 USD to get into a highly unfinished product, that may or may not go Free-to-Play on launch.  My curiosity trumped my sense of wallet-preservation, and so far I've been rewarded well for my curiosity.  That said, caveat emptor applies here.  When the game achieves a higher release phase, I'll just write a different review.\n\nWhat Works\nThe old-school MMORPG system is really awesome; I see why people like Star Wars: Galaxies and similar ilk.  You aren't stuck with purely being a member of [insert nation here]'s military; don't want to fight?  You can be a delivery person.  Or an exotic dancer.  Or a mad scientist whose pets protect them.  Or a diplomat.  Or a roboticist.  The sheer number of skills, and ways you could choose to play this game is staggering.\n\nSome would not like how 'cyclical' the crafting system is, but I think it's genius.  Anyone can craft anything.  The problem is, it's often a better idea to buy certain materials before going on a crafting spree.  This is genius, because it drains money from the player-to-player economy, which is essential in this sort of game, where the market is supreme.\n\nThe armors all look awesome, and really lend themselves to the game's Sci-Fi feel.  Even the armors made from hunting specific animals look good; this isn't World of Warcraft where if you bring someone a bunch of leathers, you're going to look like a caveman doing a bad job of masquerading as a sabertooth tiger.\n\nWhat Doesn't Work\nFirst things first, the sound: it's awful.  What's worse, there's no "BGM Volume" slider in the audio options.  If you don't want to hear the awful garbage music, you'll have to turn off your sound.  This isn't as bad as you'd think, though, because the sound design in general is pretty awful.  I would request the developers consider hiring sound personnel when they are able to (alpha is usually not the time when audio is added to games...so this may be the case for a while.)\n\nThe mob and resource placement breaks my immersion to little pieces.  Animals are haphazardly placed to menace you whenever.  Resource nodes spawn randomly in what appears to be a sphere.  Sometimes you'll see a resource on your minimap, but be able to get to it because it spawned inside something else.  I feel this is one area where referring to the themepark MMO literature would be a good idea; putting ores near mountains, plants in fertile regions, in short just putting things where they make sense would make the game more immersive.\n\nNext the plot is as cliche, trite, and been-done as you can possibly get.  In addition to hiring audio personnel, I also suggest hiring a writer.  As an additional qualification, don't hire a writer who likes to be verbose.  One of the problems with this game's quests, is that there is too much text.  A little brevity goes a long way!\n\nDue to the alpha state, there's various glitches in the game.  My favorites involve dying; if you die near resource nodes, you can harvest them while dead.  Additionallly, you can use /stuck while dead to teleport to the nearest cloning facility, while dead.  As a dead person in this game, it's amazing what you can do without being a zombie!  Further, don't dismiss the 'choose clone location' window; if you do you have to enter a special chat command in order to get it to come back, which can be frustrating.  Also, sometimes if you die and choose a clone location, the game will crash; when you log back in, you'll be alive, where you died.  Free field revive courtesy of the game!  I know that's not what was intended (the crash gave it away)...but, well, it's the thought that counts.  Thank you, game!\n\nThere's also the fact that when transitioning from walking to swimming it's easy to clip through the world geometry (and wind up swimming under the world), and when you use your Stealth ability, your eyeballs and teeth don't go all translucent which leads to some awkwardness.  At least my character brushes her teeth, though.  All damage from enemies currently counts as blunt weapon damage, even when said impacts come from lasers from ranged weapons.  Finally, some skills simply don't work.\n\nFinally, the graphics.  I know the game is alpha, but baking some shadows would really help the environment to A) look better, B) assist players with gathering.  There's also various optimization issues with framerates and crashing that the developers need to pay a bit more attention to.\n\nShould you buy it?\nA) Yes, B) ...But not right now.\n\nThe game's mechanics are certainly strong enough to overcome the legion of flaws currently in this title.  It's a joy to play, even if it's the most unfinished thing I've yet seen on Steam.  Due to the lack of polish, I question whether it should be here or not, to be fully honest, but I'm not sad that it is.

I enjoy very much the none combat professions .  I really  love alot of the feature they have used from older games.     I allways liked those better.   Being able to play  purely as a trader is the best part for me, i love trading so much.  Back when Swg (star wars galaxies) still ran i only played as trader and entertainer.      I allways disliked newer mmo not putting enough effort into trading and  focus way to much on pvp imo.  And also making games way to "easy" and user friendly.  (I dont mean dont be user friendly) but i really dislike not having to work to get what i want. Newer mmo you just have everything you want within first week  except maybe the best raid armor (atleast the amoutn of hours i play).  Here there is no best since it depence on how well its crafted and what you need and the resoruces used in crafting process  :)\n\nSo how can i judge this game when i only have 0.2 hours played on stream you might wonder hehe.  That is because alpha stage 1 , 2 and 3  which i have played didtn exist on stream.  alpha 4 is what is being sold access atm i beleave unless we sneaked futher and i missed it :)\n\nAnd yes the game has bugs , but have in mind you bought a early access,  not a complete game.  Also  the team making this game are very good at listening to suggestion players have.  SO dont be afraid of usings forum and suggest new things you might have in mind.  Also remember to report those bugs so they can fix em :)\n\nI for one suggested that you should be able to preorder a name as a backer, and look.  They liked the idea and added that.  So just try :)\n\nSo give the game a spin, and if you dont like it right now, try come back later when the game is more complete ,  read abotu the game on tehre site and forum they got some great ideas for the game :)","March 7, 2015","true","35.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

(never played SWG)\nI wasn't really expecting this game anymore.\n\nI've skilled equally, Rifle (beam sniper), Melee (Knife, Double handed kinfe, knife+shield), Stealth (useless), crafting\nMy feelings:\n\nBad ones:\n- - - Fights are so laggy desynced (even at low pop 6 am, ping is totally stable btw 70ms/120fps ). You don't even even understand why you got hit or miss. So "netcode" is wip\n\n- Tiny aimbot when using rifles. Plus timetravel is very slow. Pew pew... I play Arma and this mass effect shooter at the time... I've felt so bad that now I'm melee only!\n\n- Those are my main concerns because I'm considering pvp. There gonna be Hardcore server which is a good thing, I'm just hopping it won't be empty. And I'm afraid it would split playerbase.\n\n- World is not finished, designed into visible squares. Owon side is better. It sometimes freeze when you go between the frontier of 2 blocs, plus mobs get confused. FPS is very good and stable, 50% fps in Freedowtown. This game would run on bad computers which is a very good point for a MMO. Mobs usually use terrain and collision exploit. This reminds me Fallen Earth for now.\n\nGood ones:\n+Attacks seems to have angle of damage, that would mean you could dodge attack by avoiding that cone\n\n+You can roll, and I guess would be able to do some kind of combos. Like rolling stabbing in the back.\n\n+++ Progression system is kind of "Elder Scroll" one ie, you progress by practise. Ther is no bound, some skills go up to 5k points! which should represent at least few months.\n\n+++ AH with "buy orders" like on Eve Online, this will definitely help crafters.\n\n+++ The "momentum" or combo idea, I think it would reduce ganking as you won't be able to gank on first strike.\n\nConclusions:\n\nMobs should be serverside, I doubt it would be possible to dodge them (like on L4D series) due to lags/desync/heavystress. Shooting is totally crapy. I mean it's okay if you're a masse effect fanboy(girl) on PS3, but mouse aim is a bit laggy (0.3/0.1sec). From my experience PVP themed game has so much advantage to a game, whereas PVE themed is always laggy experience and repetitive, because you're more interested into the loot than the actual fight. Look on Eve, it is one of best balanced pvp game. Ok they got engineers to works on game concepts.\n\nSo I've bought a F2P game for supporting, there gonna be server wipe at launch, this is alpha round 4th and last alpha before Beta. I've just bought the right to be experienced at the launch. I'm not familiar with Alphas, except with mods of games, so my review may be a bit crude. So we can't say buy it or don't buy it as would go F2P. This is definetely a good idea of game. Dev team is 4 skilled guys, so it may take so time for update but it will come. Financial plan should be very positive so.\nSo it should get way better. I have to be patient (:\n\nI think that I won't play it because of lack of time :/ I'm sticking with DayZ Origins.\nNow it's a cool PVE game, not my taste, too repetitive. This is really like Fallen Earth technically for now, with a bad map; good, long crafting and skill system.

Even now in late Alpha it's amazing, but it has some issues. First, it needs some stability fixes, still a lot of crashes while zoning. But don't get me wrong, there are NO loading screens in the open world, the "zoning" is almost totally seamless and will be more so once the new Hero Engine update is added. The graphics are sufficient now but will include HD textures with the new engine and should look fabulous\n\nThe crafting system is at the heart of the game and it is breathtaking in its depth and functionality. This is a game that keeps me up all night for just "one more turn" just like the old days, it's utterly compelling if you like to craft. Combat works well but will be more fun when more encounters are added. Right now, there are just lots of roaming mobs who will threaten your gathering.\n\nSpeeder bikes, woot!  Harvesters, complex crafting, local player merchants, faction fighting, this is so reminiscent of the original SWG that the inspiration is inescapable. Usage based skillups, endless choice of skillls and abilities, every character is guaranteed to be utterly unique. The interdependence of the crafting system along with the incredible depth and complexity assures that the best path to success will be focused specialization in a relatively small area of expertise that will give you the ability to feed the demand for sub components that no one will be able to master on their own. Everyone will be dependent on specialists. Great system that favors crafters and supplies combatants.\n\nSiege warfare, non-instanced player housing on plots with the most unbelievable assortment of customizable furnishings ever seen in any game. The interior decorating some players have created is just phenomenal, from stylized research facilities to armed encampments.\n\nThis is a wonderful game that is young and promising, but fun to play right now. And the dev team is a dream, the owner answers questions on the forum, listens to his playerbase and is a hardcore kickass player himself. If you liked SWG, you may love this game. Gets my highest recommendation for new MMO's to watch and play.\n\nFind me on the West coast server under the name Wanderlust, with my wife Whimsy.","March 22, 2015","true","214.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

There's a huge list of things you can level up, from swimming to thievery to stealth to more tanky focussed stuff to abilities which require concentration (it's literally too much to name, I have never seen such a vast list of usefull skills)\n\nMy first 3 hours in the game:\nThe first hour I spent just wandering around the tutorial area, trying to get the hangs of the controls and menu's, exploring the place.\nSecond hour was spent doing jobs and leveling up skills like hand gun handling and trap removing.\n\nThen I went outside and killed a few robots but one almost killed me so I want back inside and coincidentially into a bar which replenishes your health. Appparently if you set up camp and there's 'entertainment' you heal faster (absolutely love this mechanic, no health potion or whatever but just rest and entertain oneself which actually makes sense too).\nBut so in this bar there was a dancer and I could talk to her, so of course that's what I did.\n\nShe asked me to dance but my guy said he couldn't, but don't worry folks, even this is handled in the greatest detail, because the dancer replied with 'don't worry! I've got a training card which will teach you some moves.' and before I knew it my guy was dancing his socks off!\n\nLove this kind of detail in games. So far I've spent all my time in the tutorial area of the game. Honestly I've never spent so much time in the tutorial, but in this case I really needed it and I absolutely recommend you to stay there for a while too. At least until you've talked to every NPC or did every job/quest.\n\nLoving the art style. It reminds me somewhat of the Deus Ex HD version. Controls could use a bit more smoothness or responsiveness imo, and the 1st person part could also use some work. In 1st person the camera just floats above your character's head and it's just not 'true' 1st person yet imo but it's more than good enough for an Alpha.\n\nTL:DR: very detailed game, A LOT of DEPTH to nearly everything you can do in it, it's rough around the edges but hey what do you expect, it has it's own style and runs good enough imo (i5 4670 stock with gtx 670 2gb & 8 gb ram at around 40-50 fps). If the devs can keep the updates coming and put in the stuff on the roadmap, this game is gonna be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ legendary,\n\n\n","June 14, 2015","true","4.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

As of now the game is coming along nicely, the crafting is complicated and fullfilling and while in need of some UI streaming it hits the nail on the head for those who enjoy carving their mark on a player driven econony. Combat is fluid (as long as there is no lag) and feels smooth with practice, there will still be moments when you are killed outright by a mob and dont quite understand why your new weapon is not working as you expected untill you realise you didnt upgrade it or that mob type has resistances to your damage type.\n\nWhile this game is easy to pickup, it is also quite complicated and has a medium/high learning curve. It can be daunting starting out with no real clear goal until you find your stride and decide what you want to be and achieve. As of now the population is low due to alpha character wipes that will occur in the not too distant future so it is a great time to jump in and learn how things work.\n\nThere are bugs and moments of lag that will be ironed out in the coming months no doubt by the dedicated developers, so just realise this when you jump in and something strange happens out of the ordinary. Players looking for an MMO that combines dedication to a server run economy who are looking for a deeper experience may enjoy this game very much but be aware, lots of reading on how things work is definately recommended before hand, check out some wikis and player made videos to brush up on the game.","August 11, 2015","true","7.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Even doh the game needs some huge grafical improvements i can see where the nature in this game is going looking great but hell need more life.\n7. funny old aspects back ingame type in name of whom your looking for if this will include players with bounties later on it will be a winner.\n8. No class or level system just epic grind of who is the best well anything, meaning you can learn and master all i guess (Or is this false? time will tell)\n9. Mounts and taming yea baby!\n10. Cycles yepp npc's work sleep and leave the shops closed, guess this will be excellent for a thief.\n\nBAD:\n1. Voices missing. sorry npc need voice i suggest looking for voice makers stat since if these npc dont get voices they will always feel dead, this is mainly the quest givers im talking about. I meet a talking droid doh good! thats what we want.\n2. Jellyfish jump, make a male character and watch that jumping animation and laugh your ♥♥♥ off (Again early access lol)\n3. UI it has been some times since ive seen something so basic in a game, sorry you need to fix this menu's and all look like its the last survivor of the cold war.\n4. Engine im worried that game is intended to look this way when its done, the visiuals needs a big update, lightning ect hell game look like its a shell at times.\n5. combat.. ok love the fact with change weapons and go pew pew again animations from hell and lol when i fire a gun i expect it to do a little more then just spew balls of lights but hell again visuals.\n\nIm ghonna add more points the longer i test this game and try to update as it it all comes together.\nI strongly suggest you look at the streams,Screenshots and so found by players because some of the visuals in the trailer is not how it looks ingame.\n\nOver all this is a great early access, alot to do ingame and its a good time to get in and answer a poll every quest or so to help the development, if its worth the current price tag even on sale, tbh im not certain should be lower its a hefty sum for a unfinished game.\n\n6/10 Pro score.\nWith better visuals,voice overs,new ui and improvements (jesus kill the jellyfish please) the game will prolly be a 9/10\nwith hopes of continuesly updated content and not a Faceplant death SWG did damn you sony. it will be a 10/10\n\nHope this was helpful\nEnjoy.\n","December 22, 2014","true","1.4"," 42 of 68 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","42","68","0","2"

From what I've seen so far, it has all the hallmarks of SWG with an incredibly robust crafting system that's ginormous with skills like genetic engineering, tailoring, fishing, culinary, robotics, cybernetics, animal handling, vehicles, etc  just to name a few. Supposedly you'll be able to play a fully enjoyable, noncombat character or you will also be able to experience the delights of a hardcore server gankathon that's never been seen before (the hardcore servers are not yet implemented but it's on the horizon, so I've heard).\n\nSince I haven't ventured very far out of the training facility I can't really comment on player cities but such a thing is possible in contested and non-contested areas from what I've heard.   And for anyone who isn't as gungho about PVP for their gaming experience like me, the non-contested areas per your faction are supposedly very expansive so there will be no real need to venture out into contested areas unless you wish to.\n\nAll I know is that no other MMO has even come close to giving me the feeling that I once had when playing SWG  and even though I know I'll never be able to bring back my beloved Zabrak creature handler from SWG, it feels so damn good to play a game that gives me the same possibilities I once had back in the day.","September 7, 2015","true","8.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","3"

If you want your hand held and guided through your game, don't bother.\n\nIf you’re looking for a in depth game that rewards those willing to put in effort and work at something, be it combat, crafting, exploring, dancing in a bar whatever floats your boat. This is it.\n\nWhile the game is Alpha at this stage with plenty of bugs and unfinished features it’s still more fun than any MMO I've played in years.  The Development team is the best I've seen in forever, the type I never thought I'd see again in this age of Early Access and Pay to Test.  Devs are on the forums actively responding to feedback, asking for information and actually listening to the community.  There are GMs online in shifts to trouble shoot issues and help gather documentation for the development team.  Really it’s something else.\n\nThe game itself is complex. So complex one could get a panic attack just looking at the crafting of something as simple as a combat knife.  It takes some effort but all the tools are there and the community is excellent even for an Alpha group.  So it’s hard to go too in depth in a review about any feature without writing up a huge section so I’ll leave it with general statements.  There is ton of information on the site and forums if you’re interested in more details.\n\nEverything they advertise about the game is there and then some. It may not be fully fleshed out but the bare bones are there and one can get a clear idea of what the finished product will be.  It’s not like so many early access games, I’ve tried my fair share, that boost all these things they want then when you get in they have two or three things kinda working sorta and tons of features nowhere even on the horizon.   Repopulation at this stage has at least a skeleton of every major feature in place that I have looked into.  It needs a lot of fleshing out but it gives you a good idea of what they plan and that they are actually working to produce what they promise.\n\nUpdates are common, It seems they have slowed down to about one a month.  Slowed down to what most people consider the “normal” rate and many times faster than what I have come to expect from Early Access games.  But don’t let that make you think it’s just some tiny little fix a few bugs patch.  The notes are huge. Tons of changes, bug fixes, balancing and fleshing out content in amounts that are staggering.  Again, this isn’t something we should be so shocked or awed about as it “should” be the norm.  But again we live in the early access era.  Final note on the patches, I don’t remember the last game I was as excited about patches as I am with this one.  They put up patch notes as soon as they release the current patch and add finished features ready for the next patch as it goes along.  Really nice to have a Dev team that isn’t “Vague” on what they are working on.\n\nIf you do buy in know it’s not all peaches and cream.  There are bugs a plenty, crashes happen but the game is more stable than many “released” ones I’ve played recently.  It’s not optimized so at times it can be laggy, I have a pretty good rig so don’t notice it much.  Mostly when opening certain menus or entering a new zone.\n\nCombat is better than I thought but still needs tons of balancing and is fairly simple.  There is a system in place for stuff like this attack causes this debuff so you use this one to trigger this debuff ect that’s pretty decent but the fights are either really easy or really hard.  There are some open world “dungeons” in place to give you a feel for what they plan and it works rather well.  But it still has a long way to go.  It is kind of complex in the mixing of different armor’s and weapons combined with the flexibility of the fitting system to the point there is no “best” build as all will work well used right.\n\nCrafting is amazing. It’s why I first came here and I am not disappointed. It still needs some tweaks but it’s the first game in a long while where crafting wasn’t just important but the back bone of the game.\n\nIf you’re like me you’ve been burned by the “Early Access” so many times you’d rather walk into traffic than try it again.\nThis is the first one I’ve ever been truly happy with making my purchase and I wish I had started up sooner than later.\n\nThe last thing I can say is out of all the games I’ve played on Steam over the years, this is the only one I was willing to take my precious game time to sit down and write a review for.\n","March 17, 2015","true","409.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

This is an sandbox MMORPG, which means that you are in control of what you do, you choose what you want to do and when to do it, this type of game won’t hold your hand and guide you through each area it has so you experience everything it has to offer.\n\nThe Repopulation teaches you the basics and then drops you into a world of countless possibilities, free to do as you wish. Quests, NPC’s, PVP, PVE, etc. it’s all there but you choose to follow them if you so desire.\n\nWhat struck me as the most unique however were the skill system and the crafting system. Skills increase as you use them, and the crafting is incredibly complex but never frustrating.\n\nThe game will be F2P on release, the early access only gives you immediate access to the game, but progress will be erased before release in order to prevent early access players from dominating the game, and a lot of perks that will carry over.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: It’s a good game with no specifically defined goals, you can do whatever you want.

PvP is completely facultative.\nthe gampelay is focused on crafting, and everyone has a place in the community. i am, for example, a dyemaker. i get chemicals for refining form chemists and sell my items to poeple who want dyes and structure builders.\nrating:\ngraphics: 7/10\ngameplay: 8/10\nvariety of content: 9/10\nlongevity: 9/10\ntotal: 8.25","October 13, 2015","true","28.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

I've never played SWG, or many of the other old school "hardcore" MMOs that everyone compares this game to, so unfortunately I can't really touch on that. But I have played Darkfall Unholy Wars, and this game reminds me of that, a little bit.\n\nCurrently the game's buggy, I managed to stumble upon some bugs myself, reported them, and received developer feedback and confirmation the very next day, where they reassured me that they made the necessary changes and that they appreciated the feedback.\n\nVery neat to have such a communicative developer team, something you rarely see now a days, especially from an indie game.\n\nIt has all of the concepts that I look for in a MMO (mobile and enjoyable economy, "hardcore" elements, open world pvp, player created and driven markets, etc.). Very few MMOs have these aspects now a days due to companies wanting to pursue a more dumbed down simplistic "care-bear" themepark experience that may potentially acquire more customers. I am very pleased with purchasing this, and look forward to possessing the benefits upon its release.\n\nRight now the game has lower graphics settings in some areas, and runs poorly on most systems due to it being unoptimized (it only uses one core on my i7-4790k). This has been addressed on their forums MANY times and they've stated that they plan on further upgrading the engine to provide better optimizations and general fluidity in gameplay.\n\nCan't wait until the game's complete.\n\n\n\n\n","January 2, 2015","true","14.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

I won't go into incredible detail because if you've made it this far you know how to read and if you've found this game interesting enough to look at the reviews you probably already have an idea what this game was like. The developers tried really hard to revive an old dead game that already had a few years behind it but they made the fatal flaw of using a bad engine to build their game on and it caused some things to fall apart. Sadly that is a sad occurrence that happens to a lot of indie developers. Luckily the devs realized what the problem was and have since decided to drop the whole "make sandbox MMO's great again" campaign and have gone for something more attainable. They are now switching to the Unreal Engine and from there, who knows? Maybe we will get a great game out of it. If you read the other reviews on here you will see that this game had a dedicated player base and the devs really tried hard to make the community happy. I want to see this game succeed because we just don't have very many good sandbox games out there anymore. You may want to wait for the devs to release some version of their new game before buying this game but I definitely recommend getting it at some point.

But since I'm reinstalling the client, and waiting for resolution of a technical support ticket which has rendered my 33hr.-old character a scripting casualty, it seems I have time to write a review.\nHaving said that, in spite of all the alpha glitches, I like this game and think it has a lot of potential.  I like things that challenge my mind.  I become easily bored with the run-of-the-mill mindless stim and click garden variety mmorpgs that your average sheeple might be satisfied with.  I'll tolerate this being rough around the edges, because I can get a real sense of accomplishment from not getting a trip back to the cloning vat after vanquishing a relatively low level hostile.   In other words, the game is difficult; and therein lies the reward.  In the same 33hrs, I had a GW2 character 2/3 of the way to max level.  Here, I'm just happy to be getting better purified water at the crafting table.\nOne big thing that this game needs and will need if it is to survive in its current vision, is plenty of players and participation.  So, to that end, I'm encouraging folks to give it a try.

If you've never played Star Wars Galaxies then be ready for a grindfest. If you find that you'd like an MMO that's (a lot more) in depth then this game will eat your time like when you take your cell phone into the bathroom when you take a dump.\nSo far I've found the community, in game, to be more than helpful to where you ask a question and you won't get ♥♥♥♥-ish answers. Very few people spamming their wares in general chat (will change over time) makes it nice to see when I skill-up in a trade.\nThe mission system can be a little annoying at times. You get missions randomly over time or when you're out killing mobs and one will appear giving you the option to be rewarded off further kills of said mob.\nThe only real annoyances I have with the game right now interface screens. If you have your mouse buttons held down (while you're moving) and go into an interface screen, when you exit out of it your camera and/or movement will suddenly change.\nAlso a small tidbit: The game has map rotation with no North indicator. Though you may find this to be silly at first but when you're trying to find your way in a city and bring up your map then close it unless you use a building as a temp heading you will find yourself getting lost very easily.\n\nOverall I find this game to be real enjoyable even in its early dev stages!\n\n6/10 - Unfinished games never get a rating over 6 due to the fact that it's still unfinished, but from what's playable right now I'd give that a 9/10.","February 4, 2015","true","7.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Some of these changes are frustrating as the current population is not very high. You must look long term. Think about how the game will change when there are enough people to fill the auction house, place good solid work orders, and fight over resources. So before you slam a change made because it complicates things, think about how this will feel with 4-5X as many players per server.  Aslo keep in mind that a server whipe, merger, or refit could come without notice, so dont get attached to your toon.\n\nIf you are thinking about playing this game at launch, you will want to jump in now and take a look around. The crafting system is super detailed and intense. The combat system is unique, and play style is completely different for each weapon and armor mix. Healers are still being give some polish, so if that is your thing come in now and help give some feedback.","June 12, 2015","true","172.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

But it is an early access game, so it's to be expected. The fps mode could do with some tweaking too, but is fun to use, if like me, you don't like toolbar button spamming mmorpg's.\n\nA very fun and unrestricted mmorpg, with 1 hell of a crazy indepth crafting system. You're not limited by a leveling system where you have to place points in certain stats. You level what you want to level up, by doing what you want to do. The crafting sytems is by far the most indepth and complex of any game I have played, so crafters should be in their element with this 1. The comunity is very helpful too, so it's easy to get assistance.\n\nOverall a good game.\n\nEDIT : This game is no longer being made.....for now.","January 20, 2015","true","39.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Having said that, this is Alpha and as expected it is rough, clunky and buggy. However the foundation is set and the game mechanics have huge potential for solid old school sandbox goodness.\nI played SWG -Pre-CU through the NGE and have to say this game is giving me that old school sandbox feeling. I feel like there is so much to learn and skills to improve upon. I have that feeling of a lost person waking up in a new world just like when I first logged into SWG, not a hero, not the center of the universe, it's just a day in the life of...whatever and whoever I decide to be.\nPlease remember the game is in Alpha and it can be a rough experience. If you can except that and want to contribute to the game’s direction, it’s a fun game and has great potential. It may always be a niche game just as SWG was always somewhat a niche game…\nThe graphics are not spectacular, the UI is buggy, and it is easy to get lost and not know what to do which is a good thing. Pro Tip: patience pays off in sandbox MMOs. The overall game play is headed in the right direction; it just is lacking the polish that comes later on in development. I am hoping this game succeeds in what so many post SWG MMOs failed to do….provide a new long term home.","December 31, 2014","true","21.9"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

A game that screams throwback to a day when SWG was still around.  A game that has a mix of Pre-CU and NGE SWG combat styles as well as a FPS feel as well.  All switchable.  A crafting system that rivals SWG and slaughters just about every other MMORPG.

I bought in to it about a year and a half ago now, and played it a few times in earlier alpha weekends. It has come a LONG way since then. That said, it has a long way to go still, but so far I must say I am absolutely loving the amount of freedom this game gives me. I do not intend to go on raids, I do not intend to become an elite combat this or that. I'm going to do some kind of specialized crafting, don't know what yet, but time will show.

Seeing as how it's inspired by and borrows features from SWG, I would say that's true. The tutorial throws a ton of information at you at once, so if you think you can just fly through it your first time, you're going to be clueless once you're in the actual game world. I actually scraped my first character (which I completely rushed) and took my time with creation and the tutorial the second time around. The result was a much more stable and enjoyable experience, even though the game is in Early Access. I'm definitely going to be sticking around on this game.\n\nGameplay: 8 ~ The Repopulation is an incredibly vast and detailed game, but with detail comes complexity. If you have enough self-control to take the time necessary to learn all of the game's mechanics in the tutorial, you'll have an enjoyable experience. It does feel a little stale in terms of combat, but that's an easy thing to overlook if you're having fun.\n\nGraphics: 8 ~ Lighting effects is where this game really shines (literally.) Though everything does have a sort of stylized-realism, (that is to say, mildly cartoony instead of Battlefield/CoD lifelike) it fits the overall feel of the game well, and I have no personal complaints.\n\nSound: 8 ~ Continuing with my theme of "It's quite good, but..." Almost all of the sound effects in the game are incredibly well done. The only things that I have trouble with so far are player voice overs that spout cheesy one-liners whenever you increase your skill level, (Hint: You can disable voices) as well as the horrendously cheesy sound effect that's used for the starter pistol. It sounds like something straight out of an 80's sci-fi movie and I can't wait to get a better sounding pistol.\n\nLasting Appeal: 10 ~ I remember reading in a feature on The Repop's website that basically offered a massive challenge. I'm paraphrasing, but it was something along the lines of, "You could max out every single skill in the game, there's nothing restricting you to any set amount of skills. However, you never will." If you spent your entire game experience on The Repopulation trying to max out all the skills, you would be set for a very very long time as far as content. There's so much to do, so many skills to try out, let alone progress to high levels. And with no class restrictions, you can do what you want, when you want, how you want, and as much as you want. That alone, to me, defines "Lasting appeal."\n\nOverall Rating: 9 ~ This game is in early access, meaning that polish is inevitable, which is coincidentally all that this game needs to be a top contender in the MMO market. I love it already, and can't wait to see where it goes from here.","January 9, 2015","true","21.4"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

If you’re familiar with the games I am referring to you will know that this game isn’t easy to get into but once you do it is a very rewarding game.\nTo the people who aren’t familiar with Ultima Online or Starwars Galaxies the best way to sum this game up is a ‘Sandbox Social MMO’. There are social skills such as dancing and storytelling which aren’t just useless emotes as these offer buffs to people around them as if you’ve raised their moral. There is a huge amount of crafting skills which you learn from NPCs or other players via these cards which can be obtained. There is a huge amount of weapons and armours which you can swap out, mix and match depending on your play style and how you want to be known. Those are just a few elements of the game to scrape the surface and a lot more that I can’t list because I would be here forever e.g. taming/pets, genetic engineering, vehicle customisation etc. Highly recommended if you want a classic MMO that isn’t just a generic WoW rip like 90% of the current MMO market.\n\nAlso no subscription so once you pay for the game you're good to go.  If I am to critique aspects of it then they would have to be the graphics as it’s not the best game to look at and the fact it’s very grindy if you’re wanting to raise one specific skill but I’ve never been too bothered by graphics and the grind is to be expected with this genre of game. It's also extremly glitchy but that's to be expected with Alpha. Honestly if you're looking into getting this game i highly suggest waiting for Beta release.","December 31, 2014","true","35.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","3"

Even with my small play time I feel I already got my moneys worth.\n\nThis doesn't seem to be a case of take the money and run either.  The devlopers listened to the community and kept us updated throughout early access and listened to what is wanted.  I'm not too sure on the exact problem, but there is still a possibilty the game will return, maybe on a new engine even.\n\nThe game itself reminds me of Star Wars Galaxies, not typical arche types that MMOs give for character creation and even though they added a tutorial, there is a lot of freedom of what to do, not the hand holding you find in most MMOs.  The crafting looked similar to SWG too, although some people disagree , it seems most people agree it is.  I didn't do any crafting so I couldn't personally say.\n\nIf it ever comes back buy it or just wait for the release because it should be free to play on release.","January 20","true","30.3"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","6"

I would say it was more like going to sleep in a cool room with a heavy blanket on, only the room tempature increased during the night making me wake up in hot sweats, although I am too half asleep to have the cognition to take the damn blanket off.\n\nIt has some great features, and I see a lot of potential in the game seeing as there aren't a lot of sci fi MMO's aside from SWTOR, and let's just be honest, that was just a bag of angry bagders.\n\nI felt uncomfortable whilst playing this title, because I enjoying the theme, but the gameplay was a little generic. I suppose even if it comes to fruition that this game releases, that won't change. Although it is refreshing to not have a leveling or class system.\n\nThe crafting system is by far the most intriguing thing about this game, so if you are expecting this game to bring you flashy pew pew lasers to the face until you are in your computer chair blind and having seizues, you are not going to like this title in my opinion. I have played games of its ilk, and the battle just doesn't cut it, but the rest of the game is quite in depth. The skill system is innovative, and the design and theme are pretty solid. I can't say that the graphics impressed me, and it surprised me that I had a low FPS. The graphics aren't bad, but I think because of the early access, a lot of the textures aren't quite rendered correctly.\n\nThere were bugs, and the game crashed on me, but it is still early access, so I am not surprised at that, however with the amount of flaws that I did see in the design, I have a premonition that the errors won't be so easily fixed, and they will continue to be a nuisance far beyond the launch date, and with a small team of entrepeneurs at the helm, I am not so sure that the repairs will be quick.\n\nAs a gamer I say to this company... GREAT JOB guys trying to innovate!!! Great idea, but lacking in application. Don't be too discouraged, because that is just the norm for developers who create MMO's in today's market. Usually the budget is too low in most cases, and the teams are quite small. I am quite sure that this game is on kickstarter, and I am all about supporting the independent gaming community.

Since then I have been playing every MMO I can get my hands on from City of Heroes and World of Warcraft to EvE Online you name it I have probably played it. The best one I ever played was a little game called Star Wars: Galaxies. It was a massive open world game that allowed you to play how you wanted, as a Dancer who heals and buffs people before battle to a lonely crafter who makes the galaxies best weapons all in the iconic setting of Star Wars. It was not to long however that Sony Online Entertainment and Lucas Arts ruined the game. After its down fall I jumped from game to game looking for the what was lost.\n\nI have found that lost greatness in a little company called Above and Beyond Technology the creators of The Repopulation, a Sci-Fi sandbox MMO taking place on a distant planet called Rhyldan that Humans landed on to rebuild their civilization.\n\nIn The Repopulation you can play as anyone or anything you can think of. Do you want to be the biggest meanest sword fighter on Rhyldan, or maybe you want to be a performer and help buff others before they leave for battle. You can open your own shop and craft items that are needed by others. How about a medic so you can join your friends in battle to keep them alive and well and maybe you can tame a few animals to accompany you in battle. This and so much more are possible in The Repopulation.\n\nI would encourage everyone to try the game and give it a chance even when there is a lot to learn at first, once you do it will be well worth it.","June 2, 2015","true","88.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

If you've got a few spare bucks, totally worth sinking some time into.\n\nI'll be checking back if the game ever makes to to final release. At the moment the video/camera can bestuttery even on lower settings with a high end machine. You'll need to be able to support max settings for monster draw distance or else you'll often load in the middle of a camp only to be chain stunned to death.\n\nCrafting currently, feels like it took the best of Vanguard's & SWG's perfectly complex crafting and enhanced it by adding even more item grades and levels within grades to the point it's just too much. It's like they were close to a great system but overdid it. There is a great in game database that links where every item is and where to get it, but unless you are the most hardcore crafter type, I feel this will be too much for you. You may also run into issues with space due to so many items and so many parts for crafting. This might work itself out as there are more players / crafters to take some of the burden off of making every part for yourself at this point.\n\nGraphics and combat make the game almost feel like Anarchy Online 2 but 5 years too late. You'll find that you get hung up on the smallest blade of grass and get annoyed at landing your speeder (fast ground transport) in trees 1 in 5 trips.\n\nOverall game play makes you come back for more but leaves you wondering why you are logged back in after an hour.","June 5, 2015","true","100.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Immediately as I logged in I could feel that once again, I was in a living universe where I could become anything, and do anything I wanted to do.  It felt great and it's something I hadn't seen in a game in many years.\n\nCourse the game is currently in early access alpha, it has some issues with the UI and the sale tab of the AH is useable but it is kinda clunky at the moment, don't fear though this will all be fixed in due time.  Other than that, I am surprised to find that I have not seen many real bugs.  The UI of the sale tab is not even bugged it's just clunky lol it's surprisingly well polished for an early access game, even so even if it were really buggy, Star Wars Galaxies had some issues with bugs as all we SWG fans know but it didn't matter because the game was amazing.\n\nAll in all, if you're one of those people looking for that old sandbox freedom feeling of being able to do and become anything that you want..

I hopped on the hype train and had a blast, i still today play WoW and enjoy some aspects of it, but i never got to play games like Everquest, SWG, DAOC or Ultima Online during their prime years. But if they were anything like The Repopulation is, or at least hopefully will become when it's officialy realesed, then i can see why people miss those days.\n\nGone are the in depth tutorials telling you everything you need to know to speed rush through the game.\nGone are the classes that defines what you do.\nInstead i have for the first time since i started playing WoW all those years ago felt lost in a new world, with new things to explore around every corner.\n\nSure, the game is very badly optimized right now and there are quiet a few things that needs to be fixed, so if you never ever would play an unfinished game, don't freaking buy this. But if you want to have a new adventure you only heard about from your older brother growing up, or if you wanna go back to those adventures you told your little brother about and don't care about a few bugs or lagspikes here and there.

Where to start?\n\nThis game I heared about before it went into a playable Alpha state. And, it intrigued me. It's an MMOSBRPG, or Massively Multiplayer Online Sandbox Role Playing Game (Long Abbreviations FTW!). And, here's my review of this.\n\nGraphics: Current: 7.5/10 Future: ?/10: So, since this game is an alpha, I have to review what is given to me. And, it's pretty good, but I can't push the high quality, due to my machine not quite being able to play at max with a good framerate, though with the upgrades that I want to purchase, maybe then i'll be able to play at 144 FPS on Ultra for this game. The game looks nice, but the character animations are a bit lazy, but they will change with time. Oh, and Dual Wielding Pistols is really funky... You hold both pistols in the same physical location, leading to some funny clipping stuff.\n\nOverall Gameplay: 9/10\n\nCombat: 10/10: This game has such a unique combat system. It has one main governing system, the Openings System. If you shoot someone in the Leg, they are the suceptible to other things like maybe Bleeding, or if someone is Startled because of how close you got to them from a shot or slash, then maybe you can Dishearten them and make them deal less damage. Any way you slice it, this game does not have "Basic" attacks, each and every attack has some flavor of modifier. And that is really cool!\n\nCrafting: 7.5/10: Ok, this is the meat and potatoes of this game. I can't go over each aspect of crafting in this review, because it would be a 20 page college level paper... If you want the details, The Repopulation Forums are a great place to go to learn about crafting! Basically, you gather materieals, such as Contaminated Water, Hides, Wood, Berries, Metal Ores, etc. and process them into components to make other things, such as Fittings which will have their own spotlight in the next section. The main problem with the crafting is, there is soo much crafting that you will probably make your head explode trying to do it all, but fear not, you can still make money as a gatherer through the Work Orders system which will be talked about in it's own section.\n\nGear System: 10/10: This game has a fantastic gear system that revolves around 100% Customization. Every Gear Item is a shell, you put Fittings into the shells to give them buffs such as Physical Resistance or Penetration, or Burning status effects, or more Health, or more Endurance, or more Momentum Retention, just about every stat in the game is given through Fittings you put in your Armor or Weapons.\n\nAuction House: 10/10: This is one of the best parts about the game, the "Auction House" It has several functionalities such as Work Orders and a plain auction house ripped straight from WoW. Work Orders allow gatherers and crafters to work together to get items in exchange for Credits (this game's currency) a Crafter can put out a Work Order from anywhere in the world (you can also buy and put things on the Auction House anywhere in the world) and a Gatherer or other Crafter can put in the items to fufill the Work Order and get a posted amount of Credits for their assistance.\n\nFinal Verdict: 8.5/10: The game needs some polish definately, but this F2P MMOSBRPG I believe will become a titan in the industry that dominates over WoW and ESO, and SW:ToR. You can buy into the Alpha with the Silver and Gold Packages right here on Steam and get some extra benefits when the game goes live some time in Q4 of this year! But the game will be 100% Free To Play, with the cash shop being 100% Cosmetic Items Only.","June 22, 2015","true","37.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It is very rare for an MMO to do that to me, but this has accomplished it.  I do not feel the need to try and gain levels to get to the end so I can either start working on the endgame or starting a new character to experience a different class.  This game hooked me by simply letting me out of the city gates and doing what I wanted.  I absorbed the scenery and killed some animals.  That is all I did, yet I want to go back for more.  Excuse me when I say, but I have not had that feeling since Star Wars Galaxies back in June 2003.\n\nEverything about this game conures up those memories so far (thinking of first impressions for both games).  The color scheme to the animations all bring back that nostalgiac feeling.  The crafting and crafting stations remind me of city in a city and making my next project.  Using my fist weapons definitely makes me miss my Teras Kasi master as the weapon and animations seem like something ripped from the past.  The wealth of "jobs" in the game is something we are not used to seeing anymore and I welcome it.\n\nSince this was a first impressions piece, I will leave it there.  If you are veteran of SWG and miss it, you may want to give this game a chance.  At the very least, keep it on your radar.  If you are burnt out on the current regime of MMOs, then definitely keep your eyes on this game.  If my opinion changes or I feel like adding items to the review, I will update it.\n\nNote:  After playing some more of the game, I thought I would advise any potential players of the game.  My above points still stand and I still highly enjoy it, but be warned the game chugs and some of the textures are ugly.  Some points, I will get great framerates and other times it will slow down and you will see massive amounts of textures popping in.  Not a deal breaker for me, especially considering it is alpha, but I know some people would like this information.","January 2, 2015","true","3.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

As an elder's day SWG fundamentalist I'm pretty surprised about how much inspiration was taken from that original title and I'm pleased every time I see it reflected in the new shiny graphics. It's too early to predict the final outcome or give a verdict, yet, but as far as I can tell it promises and delivers the true sandbox game-style many gamers like me have waited for since SWG (and even earlier, UO).\n\nTo the AD kids accustomed with FPS and action-RPG: stay away, this is probably not your cup of tea.\nTo those enjoying deep deep deep crafting in EverQuest: fasten your seatbelts, crafting is gonna be a bumpy road even for you! And I say so with satisfaction.\n\nSkills require time, patience and practice to be learnt. Exactly as I like it! And there's no one-man army (single player games and modern pseudo-MMOs) nor full loot free for all PVP. It is very much possible to be the famous fisher all over again, fishing and selling his catch without fighting. And still be on the top of the foodchain in this virtual society.\n\nChase those hunters, set up a camp for them to rest and entertain them while a medic heals their wounds and get tons of credits for doing so. Without a weapon be their champion and lifesaver.

I would not recomend this game to 90% of people. Right  now its ugly, janky, buggy, crashes a lot , and  a bit  like  trying to learn quantum physics  in kindergarten.  but those 10% of  people who enjoy that kind  of stuff, this is the game  for you.\n\nPros\nCrafting- Oh my god crafting feels  good (although probably a bit to over complicated) You can craft pretty much everything you will ever need.\n\nThe world- Its massive with lots of  places to explore.\n\nThe community- So long as you are  asking  simple questions you will get fairly reasonable answers.\n\nPets! - Want to create a better  Monster? try genetic engeneering. More  of a nature  loving sort? Tame a wild beast. Killer robots  more your  speed? yup got those too! ( though for  robots I hope you are  ready to dive  into a crafting system that will make your  brain bleed  just looking at the  stuff required to build the basic  parts for the  durn thing.) Plus side is you can probably buy them from someone who has already figured it  out.\n\nCons\nCombat- is abysmal and  boring. Its tab combat. boring. Even the "action" mode  is just tab combat with clicking instead  of button presses ( IE you click your mouse to use your  auto attack on whatever  monster you have tab targeted.)\n\nOverly Complicated- So depth is a great thing, complexity can be  a great thing, But having a graduation from simple to learn grating up to hard to master  would be  a better  way to do some  of the stuff in this game. As it is, not very new player friendly.\n\nThe community- While most of  my (somewhat) limited interaction with the community in game  has been pleasent, asking questions about  crafting, or  making a comment about  maybe things are a bit to complicated, will be  met with a level of arrogance normally reserved for  the likes  of Kanye West.\n\nKeep in mind this is just my limited experience with the game, my opinion may change but as  of now if you are  looking for a game  that reminds you of SWG, you might be better served to keep looking. Some of the  things are  the same but the game still has a long long way to go. That said the dev team seems to be active and responsive and  hopefully they can bring their  dream to life.\n\nright  now 5/10\n","August 7, 2015","true","17.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

If the developers play their cards right, The Repopulation will cause an earthquake in the MMO market of epic proportions. A word of warning -- this game, and many others like it, will not appeal to a certain faction of ♥♥♥♥♥♥mers. I would argue that this is largely due to many MMO players wanting to have everything spoon fed to them, whereas in TR you'll have to do a lot of brainstorming and theory crafting if you want to succeed. However, once you "GET IT", it'll be one of the most realistic and enjoyable gaming experiences that you'll ever partake in.  The Repopulation is in every sense of the phrase -- the ultimate successor to Star Wars Galaxies, and perhaps even has the potential to be greater. The game is overall very steady, the bugs aren't bad at all for alpha (at least on my end), the community is a breath of fresh air, the nation/city system is incredible, and the crafting is highly in-depth and fun (no, I'm seriuos, you really get the feeling that you're a genetic engineer in real life without the complex mathematics). The PvP is somewhat minimalistic at this time, but the developers have big plans including but not limited to guilds being able to siege other guilds cities (and you can fight them off with laser towers and the like). In conclusion, if anyone is even remotely interested in being apart of the next big thing, then I highly recommend that you get involved in the mix NOW and purchase early access -- you WILL NOT regret it!","March 21, 2015","true","45.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It is an extremely good game even at its current stage. I hear people try to compare it to SWG, but nothing can compare to that...

So far i am enjoying it. My videocard 290X runs the game good, but not as smooth as SW-TOR. It has more detail then SW-TOR, but it comes (logically) at a price. Different settings make huge differences in speed vs quality (as i would expect).\nOn higher settings the game looks very nice and plays not too bad but not good enough. I guess that certain optimisations will make things go smoother/better. Personally i think that for an alpha release it looks and plays ok.  Just take it down a notch and it still looks good and plays very well.\n\nAlpha? glitches?\ni have not had any lag or big glitches, the only thing i kill instantly is the music. (its not my kind of sound and after a while it  is ... well lets say i killed it. probably great music for hardrock screaming fans)\n\nQuests and gaining experience\nThe quests are easy to pick up (open email and accept missions) but difficult to find once picked up. You gain experience  by doing things. In the early stages it feels overwhelming and there are quite some areas to improve. just watch and learn in the tutorial part. You end up with a robot pet and a lizard kind of pet. very nice.\n\nOverall\nI think the game is good with a lot of possibilities. It takes time to get things right but i think that it only will get better. When my experiences change i'll update. Now i would say... if you like firefall in a bigger scale and more detail, you should certainly give it a try. (be sure to check out some gameplay vids on youtube.\nIf it is worth the money... well thats difficult. i think it is. but if you are more into SW-TOR style or Firefall fast style this one is maybe going too slow. (but i have not yet had the opportunity to race around in one of the vehicles.","February 1, 2015","true","24.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The mission system tailors itself to your playstyle, so you can do things that are purely crafting, purely combat, delivery missions, etc, or a blend of them. You can further tailor missions for specific factions. The game does not really lead you from one place to another. You move from one place to another and the missions presented to you will reflect that change.\n\nYou raise your skills by doing, not by level, as there aren't any levels. You want to raise your pistol skills, then equip a pistol and use it. A specific armor? Equip it and use it. It goes on and on. It also has viable entertainment and cooking skills, so it is conceivable to just be an entertainer.\n\nThe crafting system is fairly complex. If you want to craft, prepare to have a second job. It's an exaggeration, of course, but not by much.\n\nPlayer cities. Rogue nations. PvP, either on the hardcore server, or if you go beyond the starting areas. You can concievably play the game without PvP, such as a crafter character, or by staying around the core areas.\n\nIt's an entertaining game with a lot of depth and complexity and will hopefully do well.

The content offers exactly what a sandbox MMO/RPG should have and there is still more to come!

But OMG is it complex and did I say complex? The combat aspect leaves alot to be desired though... The crafting is like SWG pre-cu and the combat feels like SWG cu when it was first inplemented, with bad balancing, huge cool downs on attacks and if you ran into something close to your level you better run or die horribly... I am hoping that it is because it is still a early release that all that will be mopped up and squeeky clean when it is finished. I love the game thus far and how it is not a noob give me everything made to where a less than two year old can just mash buttons to wipe the world and get epic godly loot to just log in and everything dies kinda game. I love this its like read, learn everything, craft mountains, then you might rank once to learn mountains more and do it all again and take lots of notes so you dont forget what you did to get there just incase you need to make that stuff again, so you can maybe make it better than before.

I have very high hopes for this.  Being a veteran of SWG this game appeals to my nostalgia feels.\n\nPro's\n\nScope,  style and sandbox classless system are major selling points. 3 way pvp.  player run and owned cities.  immense crafting.  playing the entire game as a non combat character.\n\nCon's\n\nAnd these should be taken as it being early days and by no means final judgement on the games finished product.\n\nAnimations do seem slightly clunky.\n\nAesthetics.

Some of the early release armors are ugly.\n\nthe Faux action shooter option while a nice touch needs some work on it.\n\n\nConclusion:  Support this game.  with your help these guys can make a game worthy of us veteran SWG players.\n\nDespite the negatives I have found so far it by far has alot more promise going for it to just forget it.\n\nKeep an eye on this","January 1, 2015","true","2.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The game systems are really solid and the potential is enormous.\n\nWhat you do have to realise when thinking about trying the game is that it is an Alpha. I repeat: Alpha. Not a lot of people have ever been in an Alpha and are comparing it to Beta testing which is a whole different ball game. Public betas are usually very polished and not so much about actually testing as it is about showing up a near finished product and more about PR than anything else.\n\nSo I repeat, again: Alpha\n\n\n\nAlso, almost every question and issue with the game I have seen are things that have been answered on the forums, by Devs or even on the website. So if you are the type of person that has a hard time finding and understanding written information you will probably be quite frustrated at times. It might not  be the game for you and personally, I'm fine with that.\n\nI come from a background of playing EVE, starting in last phase of BETA and then playing extensively for 8 years and on and off after that. EVE is similar in the way that it has a quite steep learning curve, a very dedicated community and a mentality of "If this is not the game for you, we have no problem with that". I think this game might develop into a similar kind of community, and again: I'm fine with that :)","December 28, 2014","true","52.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

It was an incredible experience, had an amazing community, and left you with the feeling that you were really in a living and breathing player driven world. Combat professions were dependant on non-combat professions and vice versa, the economy was completely player driven, and you had the freedom to do and be what you wanted to be. The how and why were completely up to you. With the changes that SOE made to SWG, the player base began to dwindle, and heartbreakingly, the game was eventually shut down.\n\nEnter The Repopulation.\n\nI've only had a chance to play for a short while, however, it can be safely said that this game is a true successor to the mechanics and concepts that made SWG such an amazing and immersize experience. The Repopulation is currently in Alpha, and with that said, there will be bugs, and the development team is still in the process of creating and refining the game systems that will make to to the final release. With that said, what I have seen so far is nothing short of amazing.\n\nTo the development team, thank you SO MUCH for not only creating a game that is incredibly nostalgic for me and other players, but also for creating a game that does not follow the typical WoW/themepark/level based progression trend that is so commonplace in MMORPGs. That alone will make The Repopulation worth checking out for many gamers who want something different, and will set it apart from the current trends and gain a foothold in the niche of players who want a true sandbox experience.\n\nFor everyone who considers themselves a "SWG refugee" like myself, do yourselves a favour and make a pledge to help the development of this game. Support it and the development team, spread the word, and welcome home.","August 22, 2015","true","10.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

But the visuals are ugly.\n\n\nWhile it does have minor crashes and bugs, its alpha so the performance hiccups are also to be suspected. But no serious/game-breaking bugs so far.\nNo monthly fee, it will be F2P but not pay2win from what I read.\n\nThe animations, graphics and music are extremely boring and outdated while still requiring an endgame computer. The absense of colors.. It's usually much grayer than in the storepage screenshots. When I played this game I thought I got colorblind. Don't get me wrong I dislike cartoony games. But this game is too far to the other extreme.\n\nCombat feels a bit static as well, boring SFX, boring visuals, same story.\n\nI only played for a few hours so I should update this review later.\n\nIf they would improve the visuals, add some more colors and make the world more lively and less 'static' then this game will be the first worthy alternative/sequel to SWG (before NGE).","September 13, 2015","true","3.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

I'm a huge fan of games like Eve Online and SWG where things are player run and people are completely free to do as they choose and this game is right up that alley. Keep in mind that it is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥me in Alpha! It's got its problems right now and i've had a few crashes here and there but its definetly not game breaking. Also I don't really understand why people have been saying that there's no tutorial or it's too hard to understand. All you have to do is read the dialogue at the beginning in the tutorial zone when you talk to npcs. And if that doesn't cover it for you, the community is always happy to help.

There are bugs, graphic glitches and annying little quirks. However, they are working on them all. Since my start in this game December of 2014 I have seen lots of changes and improvements.

The exploration, crafting, community, sensible PVP-PVE balance, Player Cities and housing all makes this a home from home... thank you A&BT. I do not use Steam that much to be honest but have some games off Steam - I am however a long term backer of this game and have been testing it since the begining of Alpha 3 which is about 6 months or more now. It is an old fashioned game only in the sense that it is PURE SANDBOX. It leaves you to explore and decide what you want to do in the game-world, everything is optional. I think this game is for more mature players and commited gamers as it takes work.\n\n\nNo 'themepark' leveling or story-lines or easy to do without thinking missions [ ie go here do that and there is the npc you talk to]. You have to find these things for yourself a lot. So this is a game that makes you think and work to achive results. I like that there are no toon levels but rather skills to increase proficiency in. There are over 1000 repeatable missions accross the world if missions is your thing. The Crafting is complex, it will appeal to those who drool over real crafting requiring thought and graft. The world is beautiful and well thought out... with so much to do and so many options and paths...\n\n\nOh boy so much to try remember to say - hey "I'm in love with this game" just about sums it up and this is said by a guy in a grey beard lol so a mature well thought out comment.\n\nImportant to remember it is still a game in development and you are not buying a finished product, rather buying into the opportunity to test and help this indie project become the game we have been wating for since SWG and UO days.","December 28, 2014","true","0.1"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","0"

What few hours I did put into this game were quite impressive though.\n\nThis game has been DELAYED, but it is NOT DEAD. Do not dismiss this game! It is overflowing with potential! If this game gets a decent community it will be superb.\n\nThe issue this game is currently dealing with (and overcoming) is their game engine "Hero Engine" is owned by a seperate company. That company is going through issues and it is affecting The Repopulation. The devs have decided to switch to Unreal Engine (a good choice in my opinion) and are working on porting everything over.\n\nDue to all of this. They have shutdown the servers and disabled the ability to purchase the game until it is all resolved.\n\nThats enough about the out-of-game information. In the game we have...\n\nA very sophisticated, interdependant, beautiful, crafting system.  Crafters will love this...\n\nA wide variety of skills. So many skills that I had a hard time choosing what to start with. All skills are leveled individually (you can work on multiple at once though)\n\nA decent character customization. In truth, I thought the models looked a little odd. But theres a good amount of options and im guessing they will add more.\n\nNO LEVELS! I personally love this. You grind fanatics can still grind your skills. you gunblazing action seekers hardly have to wait for some action.\n\nAs I've said, I have few hours in this game, but from what I've seen its impressive. After the issues are resolved I'll sink more hours into this game and give a more reliable review. Until then I will not lose hope and I'll keep watching this game.\n\nSIDENOTE! As other reviews have stated, Yes the game was clunky and glitchy and crashy. However I decided it is irrelevant due to the fact that they are switching to Unreal Engine which is a much more stable Engine.

Until then, there is no price tag that would really justify buying this game as a finished product.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stockloc/recommended/322300/","stockloc","Anti-Cheat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stockloc/","285 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDid you enjoy Star Wars Galaxies, Shadowbane, Anarchy Online, Everquest or Dark Age of Camelot back in the day? Did you enjoy the era where MMO's had more complexity to them? Well, chances are you will enjoy this title. It has everything that made old school MMO's great but with a modern touch.\n\nThe problem with MMO's nowadays is that they all follow the same formula: quest, level up, get gear and loot. While this is an OK formula, I missed the more open-ended MMO's where you could go out and do what you wanted without having to follow a linear progressional path. The Repopulation does this right. Similar to SWG (Star Wars Galaxies), the developers made the game so that you could start off and get right into crafting without having to force yourself to do combat. You could do quests if you want, but you can also head right out and follow your destiny.\n\nWant to be a tradesman who earns an honest living building vehicles and houses? You can do that. Want to be one of hundreds of soldiers fighting a war on the battlefield? You can do that. Thing is with this game; there are so many features to it that it really feels like a living, breathing world. Although still in 'Early Access' it feels like a polished Alpha. Granted, there are still MANY bugs and quirks that need fixing. The game would not be acceptable to the average gamer. However, if you have that itch for an old-school MMO like I did, then pick this up. It'll scratch that itch.\n\nI can't speak for the future of this game, but there is a LOT of potential here. The world is quite large as-is and I have a feeling they're planning to expand it. What makes this game feel like an actual world is the complexity of it. It could well be a life simulator once it's released. Only time will tell.\n\nBased on what I've experienced so far and the promise this game shows, I have no choice but to rate it a solid 8/10. However, if they fix the bugs, clunky UI & map glitches and add a little more pizazz to the game, I'd give it a 10/10.

If you love open-world sandbox games, this is the game for you.\n\nIts Alpha.  Things are amiss.  Because its Alpha.  But there is still an incredibly rich experience to be had even at this early phase.  The Alpha community is generous, helpful and knowledgable.    Are there glitches, bugs, random CTDs and errors than require you to wait for a midnight server reset to unstick your character?  Yep.  It's Alpha.  These things happen.\n\nThere isn't a lot of hand-holding.  In fact, a lot of critical documentation has yet to be implemented, but give the game a day or so to grow on you.  I'm a SWG day one vet and have quite a bit of exposure to sandbox games.  I was still mystified by many of the game's aspects.  Three days in, I had figured most of it out.\n\nFair warning: the crafting system is incredibly deep and complex.  This isn't going to be like Galaxies where you can be self-sufficient after leveling a couple of Alts to Master.\n\nI have a couple of beginners 'tips:  There's an NPC doctor in the hospital who wants parasites that can be looted while mining or logging.  Grab the 10cr used logging saw and used mining drill and have at it.  Rise and repeat all the way to your fist vehicle.  Price are about 2K for a decent cycle.  Or buy a Light Assault Mech and get killed by a vulture.  I take that back, don't by the Light Mech.  Just buy a cycle.\n\nAnytime you get an Engagement Mission....head out and do it.  The rewards will be worthwhile.\n\nDon't start fights you can't finish....specifically with any NPC mob that has "Medic" in their name.  Serioulsy OP atm.\n\n8/10 currently.

I got this game because people get referring to it as a spiritual successor to SWG and I haven't played a really GREAT MMO since SWG (I don't think there are any MMO's out there that can match SWG for being a true MMORPG Sandbox game)\n\nHowever I found myself comparing every tiny detail to how SWG did things, and The Repopulation came up short on absolutely everything. Ofcourse this game is still being made, and you can really see what they are trying to achieve with it. I'm probably jumping the gun with my judgements and I should come back in 6months to a year to see the progress.\n\nHaving said that I don't think it can compare to SWG, i'd still recommend picking up this game, or atleast watching it's progress. It has the potential to be the only true Sandbox MMO out there that doesn't send you on linear quests from level 1-90 killing boars and running from point a-b until you max your characters level out. You can see that they want this game to be for the players and run by the players, in game economy driven by player crafting, player cities, completely explorable landscapes etc...\n\nJust be warned if you're missing SWG then this isn't the game for you (currently)","December 29, 2014","true","2.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Very much feels like the spiritual successor to SWG but with a lot more depth.\n\nThe diplomacy and entertainment systems are pretty amazing.  Combat is exciting, and not overly easy.  If you don't pay attention you could die pretty quick.  Much better than the grind I'm used to in other MMOs.\n\nWith the upgrade of the engine the graphics should really shine too, I'm looking forward to it.","February 8","true","12.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Its different, fun to play at this alpha stage and the potential is huge in this game. It is alpha so its by no way perfectly running, but not a problem in my opinion. I've been hooked like I haven't been hooked on a game in years ...\n\nCrafting is vast, looks huge to begin with but is not as bad as it looks when you get into it. There are vast number of components to make. Fighting is good but plenty of improvements to come I think. Player cities are good fun when you get into making your own home. Lots to make and Im sure lots more to come.

Yes, without question..\nIt's got bugs and weird things going on.. and that's just in harvesting.  I'm sure there are bugs and glitches with the game, I noticed a couple minor things, and the game crashed twice on death in the 6 hours playin.\nLots of reminders of back when... games were games and sheep were scared... wait no thats  not right. But you get my point, maybe.  If not suck it up and buy the bloody game.. you have paid more for worse.\n\nOk I am very comfortable in adding this to my review at this point.\n\nI can not think of a single reason NOT to buy/own/play this game as it stands right this moment.   Unless you do not like to play challenging games, within an oddly fantastic community, being developed by Devs who honestly hear all sides..listen..AND make choices they feel most comfortable with.\n\nI don't write reviews.. why??  Dad always said.. "unless you have something positive to say, keep it to yourself until you are asked."\n\nNo game since UO and SWG has even began to offer this variety of freedom without a single bloody "RAIL"..you must quest this.. talk to them.. join this.. be called that.. waste hours getting into that boring daily for yet another chance for something useless. Ya all that theme park garbage just isnt here.\n\n\nThis is a game for gamers who love the journey of building their Characters.. Exploring.. Crafting.. Killing.. Dying.. and goin again.  You are the end game.. What is our goal??  What do you do??\n\nSand is pouring into the box here, the game is being constantly worked on and developed, This is Alpha.. (frankly better than over half launched games as is)  and there are bugs, tweaks, twerks, quirks, and mobs that are jerks.   Trust an Old Dog.. this one is worth your money.\n\nNOTE... FOTM gamers who need to rush to the end of their MMO like it is single player.. This is not your game..  Time wasted rushing to sit and wait and cry about no content section is >>>> that way..\njust sayin..

I am aware that the game is in Alpha phase and that it's far from reflecting the actual finished product but right now paying 40 $ for a game like this seems kind of a ripoff to me. (It's really not fun at all.)\n\n-It's crippled with numerous bugs of all sorts and very poorly optimized (to the point that it sometimes becomes unplayable (my framerate as dropped several times below 10 fps and all the graphics settings we're tuned down, plus I'm running this game on a pretty beefy computer.)\n\n-The screenshots in the preview area of the game store page does not reflect in any way what you get when you play the game (as in the actual game looks much uglier)\n\n-I literally spent around an hour in the main town just to find a NPC to complete the most basic quest. (Couldn't get the proper indication from the other NPCS or other players for that matter.)\n\n-The game has an extremely steep learning curve that may not appeal to all players (I was prepared for that.)\n\n-The training area where you begin could use a lot of work to help new players.\n\n-Almost every annimations in the game looks sluggish and unpleasant to the eye (Even basic attack annimations from mobs, To the point that you sometimes ask yourself if the monster is attacking you or not.)\n\n-Servers get super lag spikes from times to times.\n\n-Audio tracks sometimes cut right in the middle of the song or start at improper moments.\n\nIn short, if you buy this game just understand that the money you are investing is really to support the developers more than for the actual game itself.\n\nUpdate since last release: (14.12.1)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n-> The overall look and feel of the game has improved.\n-> The is still a lot of work to be done on the texture side but considering the state of the game this is not a major issue.\n\n-> Character and Monsters annimations have been improved. (Thanks god.)\n\n-> The game is now much more playable than it used to be. (At least for the time I've spent trying the new version around 2-3 hours)\n\n-> The sound track still cuts out of the blue like it used to. There has been no improvement about this issue. It's rather sad because it seems like some of the songs in the game are really worth listening to. (Adding a fade-in/fade-out effect would really help to keep the player immersion into the game)\n\n-> Switching my review from "not recommended" to "recommended"  you can walk around and have fun exploring the map fighting a couple monsters along the way. This game is still very far from perfect but at least now it's playable.\n\nSide note: Those who think about playing this game like an "action game" (Because of the 3rd/1rst person view mode) don't make the same mistake that I made. This game is really meant to be played like your standard ♥♥♥♥♥♥me. Switching into 3rd/1rst person doesn't really bring anything new to the table nor does it make the combat more "dynamic" in any way.","January 3, 2015","true","12.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","19"

Despite the bugs that are present, this game is really fun, addicting and has great potential for an early access game.  The game *IS* challenging, but you will feel great satisfaction when you build up your character the way you want to.  Not for the faint of heart, as you'll need a lot of patience to learn the basics (Mainly crafting), and to learn how to get through the game. Food for thought.\n\nThis game offers great freedom on how you want to build up your character. You can become a crafter in many different types of trade skills available in the game, a melee/rifle/flamthrower weapon wielding soldier (just as an example), or both if you want to pursue that path.\n\nI'm glad to be able to support this game.\n\nOn the other hand, being early access, it is present with some horrifying bugs that render this game almost unplayable at times (Random CTD's, Lag spikes at random intervals of time, combat hiccups and farts), causing you to rage quit in the end.","November 21, 2015","true","227.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Combat, crafting, skills, abilities, gear, the mission system... all at various stages of "conceptual" implementation without being complete or interwoven with the other systems in the game - combat being the most lacking.  Most systems are designed to be overly complicated for no reason, tooltips are vague and inconsistent leaving the player to question pretty much everything they look at in-game.  Poor english and grammar skills from the development teams leaves many tooltips incomprehensible.  GM staff is malevolent and vindictive often speaking up in general chat about their pleasure in disciplining alpha testers for testing things innapropriately without an obvious communication to testers of what is and is not appropriate.  If this game ever does go live it will be a major bot-fest as pretty much everything is levelled up runescape style.  For example: you can level vehicle manuevering by auto running into a wall afk which you guessed it, will get you banned.  Hope you don't walk away from the keyboard momentarily while driving to that grind spot and forget to come back!  In its current implementation the game seems to simply be a crafting simulator where combat is just a "pick your weapon skin" gathering profession.  Like most games out there nowadays the community is fairly toxic though even more-so than normal.  What do you expect from a game advertised to have hard-core gank (and grief) and loot your corpse pvp.","July 18, 2015","false","25.4"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","22","41","0","4"

Both are inevitable just not at the same time...\n\n01/06/2015 I am on a quest to craft one element of the robotics tree... 38 hours in, the quest continues.\n\n20/5/2015 Improvements to ui and map have been made. Still needs more work. Surprised to see an announcement this is releasing q4 2015. I feel very dubious but quietly hopeful(active friendly devs) about the launch quality at this point.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWith regret, at this point in development 04/05/2015 I would have to give this a thumbs down with an advisory of "Check back regularly". I will periodically update the review as progress is made.\n\nIt has sparks of brilliance and oodles of potential unfortunately interspersed with some truly regressive UI/Gameplay systems coupled with extremely poor performance/graphics.(currently) Playing it I could not help the nagging feeling that a lot of the decisions relating to the gameplay experience are not taken primarily by a game designer as much as by a technical programmer (at this point). Just my opinion. Complexity is never a problem, Impediments to gameplay are.\n\nA few points:\n\nIt was £14.99, could have been worse.(regularly on sale for about £11)\n\nThe animations/lag, performance and graphics/textures need a lot of work which is understandable, (Update 20/5/2015 - But disappointing after seeing the impending launch announcement. How much do games really change graphically from beta to launch, I can vaguely recall only 1 or 2 ever that drastically improved from beta despite all the rhetoric and promises. I have to say this team of devs are very communicative and the community (what there is atm) has been great and I applaud that and certainly hope they achieve what they want. Altho experience has taught me to be very cautious in my expectations with games in this position.)\n\nThe combat system has great potential.\n(Update 20/5/2015 - Grown on me even more, very enjoyable and full of depth, multiple weapons, skills, stances, great stuff)\n\nThe gathering/ harvesting seemed slow initially and I was beginning to tire of the slooow progress bar but I believe it sped up after my skills improved, thankfully.\n(Update 20/5/2015 - Gathering/harvesting is similar to fallen earth/darkfall. like it there? You will like it here.(Take note I am not talking about crafting))\n\nThe non combat skills/ non combat ways of playing show what can be done when the will is there. (Heavily influenced by what has come before) I did not think I would have any interest in the entertainer skill lines. Who knew...\n(Update 20/5/2015 - Again, grown on me, love it. Multiple buffs, camps, no complaints).\n\nThe mission system - A nice idea but needs some serious work especially as it will primarily be what a lot of people will be doing at least initially. You basically receive emails from questgivers randomly from a pool offering you jobs based either on your skills or a filtered list you choose. Great idea. In practise however....\n\n(Update 20/5/2015 - - The following has been improved, still very indie like, but better than before, still needs overhauling not tweaks)\nThe unhelpful dot system...(map/ui) is like going thro a timewarp. No names of npcs, (trying to hover over the tiny dots to get a name to show is not fun especially with moving colour coded, no explanation, npcs). No icons, no guide, no direction for quests (rarely or sometimes just counterintuitive with colour clashes and light dark issues) Instead taking the novel approach of having npcs that like to move about and also disappear at night. (inconvenient to you as a player, sounds good and immersive on paper.... its not) The only time I could tell night from day was the pseudo day/night cycle of entering buildings. Bright outside and eerily dark inside regardless of gamma.\n\nMusic and sound effects are buggy, raising in volume despite the ingame settings. Footstep sounds are located incorrectly on headphones.\n(Update 20/5/2015 - no change).\n\nCrafting/Looting Materials graded A9 -F0 ??? Looting an npc for C9 skins is very immersive..... which leads to...\n\nThe crafting system. Let me put it in perspective. 12 hours in (now 17...)(now... 27....38), having devoured every resource/guide for crafting on steam, the internet and ingame I could find I have still not crafted the first or any aspect of the robotics tree and accept that I probably will not in the forseeable future. (01/06/2015 I refuse to quit until i craft something in that skill-line) A first for me. Calling it overly complex does not do it justice. Insider knowledge is needed.(38 hours in I would adjust this statement to say it is just extremely convoluted)\n\n(Update 20/5/2015 - Using a 3rd party craftmap utility combined with 3 (currently) google spreadsheets and going thro the  npc inventory and crafting database ingame I am breaking it down step by step what is needed, but is this a good design? Should I have to do this? How many will do this or even want too? Time will tell. It still seems too unwieldy to work. Applaud the concept but I still believe it will change. I have reached skill level 37 in robotics (01/06/2015 now 50s....) tho by applying skill points from a secondary xp system. (100 I believe to reach craftable bots, not the components)\n\nThread about how complex the system is showing components needed for 1 item only. This guy nails it: https://www.therepopulation.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=9414\n\nI get it. This drive to get away from casual gaming. I am with you. BUT complexity for complexities sake is just wrong. The idea that you are going to get hundreds of players all specialising in individual aspects (not styles or branches of) each crafting profession so they can support each other on a server is beyond wishful thinking. I have no doubt this system will change, or adjustments will be made, before or after launch once its experienced by the masses.\n\nIts a sandbox. (good)\n\nSkill based systems rock. (and always have)\n\nPerformance is hit and miss and obviously needs work.\n(Update 20/5/2015 - A lot of work considering the announced release date. 30 second lag upon loading in. Lag crossing server boundaries, random lag. Performance drops the longer your in game.(memory leak?) 10 sec lag when opening the new ui map. It goes on).\n\nAspects of it remind me of a cross between Fallen Earth/Star Wars Galaxies and Darkfall Online. (The original)\n\nIt truly feels like an alpha from many years ago with a lot of work/feedback needed. But an alpha with a hell of a lot of potential. I have only briefly touched on a lot of it. I could write a lot more.\n\nUpdate 20/5/2015 - I think the only question is if you should spend money on it in its present state, not what it will be as your not purchasing that, as its going to release f2p eventually. You are buying this product as is right now. I think unfortunately 27 hours in I would just wait for the f2p release if I could go back. It needs a hell of a lot of work and seeing and playing it in its present state it feels a bit of a gamble how it will turn out. I would love for it to work out but experience teaches caution.\n\nEdit - Added a url for crafting thread.\nEdit - wont to will not\nEdit Update 20/5/2015 and altered summary at end.","May 4, 2015","false","39.3"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","21","40","2","12"

It's steeped in the best parts of SWG, while shaking loose a lot of what I dislike about the MMO formula. One example is how missions are emailed to you, and delivered upon completion. I am not a mission oriented player, so I can now pick and choose what is convenient so as not to disrupt my current agenda.\n\nCombat is very tight, and feels like it should. The crafting is extreme enough that it will easily be a full time job, which it should be given the economy will be player driven.  The map design is shrugged off as a necessary evil, filled with pockets of the same enemies and resource spawn areas. I am somewhat confused by this, since these resources that need to be harvested appear in the same areas, grinding these with many players will be a mess. Unfortunately not the kind you'd see in a survival game, where brutality breeds success. I picture more of a drawn out wack-a-mole. This could be wrong, we won't know until closer to release.\n\nThere's exactly and only one problem I have with this game. Not enough of you are buying it. It will need master shotgun medics, and racist vehicle merchants. It needs entertainers and people who need entertaining.\n\nJust purchase and forget. One day you'll log on steam to see it has released, and just like that you have a new experience to embark on.","November 15, 2015","true","16.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It would of been a deep sci-fi sandbox MMO. Then it died. Now in light oif that and that they are using IMO a much better engine I think that whatever they do come up with in the future will have the benefit of further planning, thought and previous development. The new lite FFA version they are going to use as a mid-term project looks really interesting.

Motivator needs: 300 random copper resource   Motor: 200 random iron resource. " But in Repopulation you require to construct small annoying indevidual parts.  to make an armor you need textile and polymer, but to make the textile you need to go through the phase of making the textile from even smaller bits and bobs from impossible to find pieces.\n\ni am kinda crying about this, as it's an annoying chore and a bit too complex, But again. 1 part requires 2 - 4 parts. and those 2-4 parts need another 8 parts to make the 2-4 parts, and it splinters down to more and more fustrating time and hours trying to figure out the crafting.\n\nin SWG you could still just slap in low quality materials into an battledroid and finish it, but of course, result in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bot, the game taught you to advance more, look for more spesific resource over time and then use factory parts for easy mass manufacture.\n\nJust saying, to build a in Repopulation.... Tons of annoying parts... SWG Swoop bike = 1600 Units of non-ferrous metal and 6400 units of ferrous metal. Now that was fun, you got quick result, Cheap yes, but you made something.\n\nI haven't come around to figure out the housing of the game yet, i do have high expectation for housing like SWG did, i do miss my droid workshop...\n\nI can't recommend the game in it's current state to be played as it's rather complicated, unfinshed in details and lacks proper tutorial for the rest of the game, it pretty much tells to you shoot stuff and keep doing it til you get better and the player base just tells you to gather stuff and sell it for money, So again... not recommended for players with short attention span or patience.\n\nI can recommend this if you wish to help the game to improve, figuring out the quests and the inhumanly difficult crafting system and prehaps point the devs the right way, as just understanding the game at the moment is a challange, good for fokes with a good memory and alot of patience.\n\n[Edit] If you are going to try it out and support them, i recommend checking out the "Getting Started In The Repopulation" Guide for this game on steam, it can save you some time.\n\nAnd i'm done crying.

Look into its keymappings. Usually games which have very complicated keymappings, and will take you about 5 to 10 minutes for just learning and remembering keybindings are good games.\n(And I mean those games that recognize mouse thumb buttons. It is ridiculous for games nowadays not recognizing thumb buttons.)\n\nAnd this game had very complicated keybindings which scared me away. I now regret for dodging this game, because after asked my friends about this game, I knew I could have an enormous world to explore. But I gave it up too early.\n\nAnd now, the server has been taken down, and I don't know when will it be openned again.\n\nMy experience has taught me that, if a game had very hard learning curve, just stick to it and get used to it. It always needs some hardwork before you can succeed and achieve something.

Crafting & City Housing could've been, but they're just as broken as every other aspect of this game. The backers are hostile towards anyone who mentions this. The devs respond with, "Dx 11 & hero engine update will fix everything". No, it will not. Two patches focused on suckering new players in and keeping backers on top of the economy. Zero attention paid to broken mechanics. Next patch won't focus on any of them either.\n\nMap - Completely fubared. Pass 4-5 zones and you're crashing. Teleport = 50% chance of crash. Got a buddy with you? Not anymore, he's invisible to you. Ridiculous amount of holes in the map. Some areas are so bad you get stuck in them. Teleporting out just moves you to another area and brings the bugs with you, if you dodged the teleport crash. This is by far the most broken and frustrating part of the game.\n\nCrafting - This is probably the strongest aspect of the repopulation. Still has it's bugs, and it's meaningless if you can't get around to collect resources without back to back crashes, loading freezes, etc.\n\nCombat - Clunky, unresponsive, half the time your fittings aren't working and there's no point fighting anything. Buffs are equally screwed up. Most of your time will be spent running away from a fight because of some bs mechanic not working or the NPC bugging out. We see these problems a lot in alphas, we just usually see some sort of progress on fixing them.\n\nPVP - Nobody PVPs because combat is garbage. There isn't even an incentive to pvp. A lot of people come in wanting to test pvp and end up jumping threw a lot of hoops just to be able to pvp. Three second fight and... we're done.\n\nCity Sieges - Doesn't exist. This is how I got sucked in. Fake video with fake city fight. I figured if they were at this point in the alpha it had to be pretty solid, right? Nope. Cities are so broken they should be overhauled before even thinking about sieges.\n\nSandbox - You can't have a sandbox if everyone is shoehorned into what works vs what they want to play.\n\nIn short, EVERYTHING feels half-♥♥♥♥♥ with a "it'll get fixed later" attitude. This is a small team, big game, and it's alpha, I get it. But how many times are you going to use that excuse? How long has it been in alpha? Who's going to fix it later? Why would you continue building a house on an unstable/broken foundation? Fix something, anything.\n\nThe backers own the game. They own the cities. They own the economy. They demand new content and get it. And if you try to question the devs about critical bugs not being addressed you will get mobbed by them. The game is perfectly stable and ready for release in their opinion. (your 20 bucks will feel wasted, and 60 bucks for a game this broken is just beyond nuts.)\n\nI think people want a good scifi mmorpg, this just isn't it. This one calls itself an alpha, says they're ready for beta, patches like it's open, but feels like a first year alpha. This team's "direction" coupled with hostile backers conning people into buying the game has turned this into a "Stay the F away" for me. I've seen nothing to indicate things will get better.","July 24, 2015","false","448.5"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","11","25","3","2"

Yes the crafting is complicated and has huge depth and the game doesnt hold your hand.\n\nBut deep down, in an attempt to add deep crafting, they have forgot to add any ease of use. For example, to craft a gun, you need to craft X amount of components, and those components need Y amount of items. And to figure out where to get these items from, you have to navigate an over complicated badly written in-game database, which tells you what node is needed to harvest. Once you know the node, you then have to scan while in the respective zone in order to find their location.\n\nThe animation of characters and monsters is something from early 2005, the movements are sharp and at times 'spikey'. Ability visuals are uninspiring currently and its impossible to tell any visual difference. The graphics as a whole are nothing special either and yet they use a lot of system power. This all may change as there was talk of them using a newer more up to date engine in a future patch.\n\nThe audio is almost pointless, and the sound effects are uninspiring and just a general laser pewpew for almost every gun..\n\nThere is little community (at least on EU servers) and the ones i have come across have been verbally hostile/rude, which impacts a sandbox game much more than a theme park, as you require other players assistance to progress (crafting, farming, forming pvp groups etc).\n\nThe blog states the release is Q4 2015 which concerns me as i see this game still as a very early alpha test.\n\nDeep down, the ambition is amazing, SWG + UO is the inspiration behind the game, but they have bitten off way more they can chew.","July 1, 2015","false","13.9"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

You don't "level," your skills increase as you use them (which is cool), except it isn't really followed up by anything.  You don't level up your gun skill, then go to the gun shop and get a badass gun.  You level up your gun skill, then look on the auction house for a gun mod that adds "+1 armor penetration."  Meh.\n\nFurthermore, I played 11 hours early on, then didn't play for 8 months b/c killing mutated wolves got old.  When I logged back on months later, the only thing they had changed was the UI look.

I don't think they should be charging money for this. Most of my time was spent trying to figure out where to go. Allot of the quests were bugged. The "vultures" that you fight early on have this screech that's ear piercing and you just can't get away from it and I was hearing the ambient noise from the tavern long after I left it and I was out in the forests. When I was working on some quests, even though the quest said it was going to be easy for me, I was randomly one shotted by some bigger mob. Just weird random stuff would kill me after it took almost 15 to 20 minutes to get back to where I was.\nThere were also times I would play for hours and never see another player. If I did see another one they never responded or were on completely different quests. It was very lonely for a mmorpg.\n\nThe crafting system looks very involving and fun but rest assured you will be crawling around online looking up how to make really simple stuff or even where to get materials. I like complicated and it has a ton of possibilities but the crafting menu needs to be looked at more.\n\nYeah, I know it's early access. Yes I know it's not finished, blah blah. I still feel like I got ripped off a bit.\n\nSo... my recommendation: Don't get it until they at least figure out the early levels. I have to admit, that tutorial was painful to navigate.\n\nI might check it out much later. Maybe in a year or more when all the bugs get stomped.","November 4, 2015","false","11.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I subscribed to the newsletter and have been following the development for the past few years.  "Early Access," is not something I normally like to participate in due to several games having been pulled before release, the cancelation of the Star Gate MMO before beta, and decline of the subscription based MMO genra as a whole.\n\nA few months ago I decided that it was worth the risk, the game looked more finished than most MMO's Ive participated in Beta with.  I played several hours of the game enjoying it for the most part.  I never liked the walled in feeling of the land, the lack of information around the crafting system, and the dialogue system with the NPCs but none of that is enough to warrent a bad review.\n\nContractual issues aside with Hero Engine and the game developer I understand the hold in the development cycle while they plan an alternative route.  I support a switch to another engine like UE, i think it will be a great step for this game as long as they are happy with the contractual and royalty terms of that engine as well.\n\nWhat I am unhappy about is the development of the Single Player / LAN game based on this concept which has caused them to shelve the MMO for a year and possibly longer before working on the game that they have been advertising and collecting capital for.  There is a word for the wrongful  deception intended to result in financial gain, its call FRAUD.  Now whether this is intentional, accidental, or coencidental is not clear, regardless the possibility exists.\n\nThe only advantages I can see with Fragmented is the release of game sooner so they can continue bankrolling Repopulation.  The disadvantage is in the simultanius development, while there is some advantage to this on a whole it will mean more delays as support will have to be given over two products at the same time unless they hire even more staff than they had previously id expect slow downs in the development process.\n\nI'd give the game an 8/10, the company id give a C rating.  I cannot recommend this game until it is out of "Early Access."  The game that I previously recommended before december 2015 no longer "exisits" and I feel that the future of the game is in jeopordy, I hope im wrong.\n\n[I'll consider revising this review later this year or beyond depending the release of any additional information on Repop, or an explination on the necessity of Fragmented beyond, give the fans something now]","March 25","false","12.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

This game seemed to have potential, especially with very active developers. Engine problems and server shutdown notwithstanding, I still can not endorse this game. I put in 200+ hours, but to be honest, I simply never enjoyed it.  The game is very deep crafting wise and there are a lot of interdependencies which made crafters happy I think, but I am more combat-oriented and the combat just had no impact. There was not "heroic", "badass" or whatever else feeling you want when you are in combat. Combat was simply boring. The open-world aspect felt very, very restrictive. Climbing hills was out of the question and even bushes and fences were challenging to jump. I felt restrained at every turn in this game. The music and sounds felt wrong as well which further killed the mood for me. So if someone does not like crafting, I can't recommend this game.\n\nOn another note, Fragmented, the survival game that The Repopulation morphed into is not bad. Same style, look so if you want to get a bit of a feeling for the game, wait till they let you play free for a weekend.\n\n","May 22","false","163.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

As the game improves and the devs put things right, the game will be a good game, that WILL worth the money. Many of us has a craving for something like this since SWG. The nostalgia is strong. This game has the promise to bring those days back. The crafting is already massive, complex system. Castless character development, open PVP, lots of customization options. What not to like?

It already has things I find as glaring deficits in most modern RPGs/MMORPGs: the basis for a robust economy,  a complex crafting system that requires specialization, cooperation, and market use (and abuse!). It has player housing, both instanced and open world. I thinik it will be interesting to see how these pan out in the long term.\nAll this game needs now is a driver for demand:  A population that has a reason to need or want the large myriad of items that can be crafted.  How to draw a population? This is a no brainer.  Incorporate some features that other games have already done well: A good combat system, good end-game content, and good aesthetics options, both in character and the characters' possesions.  Character development is key in keeping players. The Repopulation still seems to be (understandably, given its developmental stage) lacking in these areas.  However, it is definitely one to keep an eye on in the coming months!\n\nFor now, I don't recommend picking up this game.  While it is promising so far, it does have a long way to go in order to become viable.

Besides that the quest system is broken and some missions require too much time running around to cover long distances to collect very little and have even less in return. The game is not rewarding.\n\nThis said it will certainly please its own crowd but feels very frustrating and disappointing from my point of view. I will probably not pursue it past the alpha/beta phase unless a lot of things get square out and fixed to make it more attractive.\n\nAnd yes one last but very important thing: grinding has stopped being fun a hell of a time ago. If I wanted to aim for a grindfest kind of game I'd know exactly where to go and that also precisely places where I'm keeping away from. There is a huge difference between making things difficult or challenging and just making them horribly frustrating just because they have to be repeated a thousand times for very little progress or reward (again). Please check TESO for that matter. Greatest PvE system seen in a while.

At this point the core systems of combat and crafting need complete overhauls.\n\nCombat is wonky, especially with melee combat.  They attempted a hybrid tab target with crosshairs and they didn't succeed at either one.  For an old school mmo they really need to stick with an old school tab-targeting system.  They tried to add a self aiming mechanism and it simply doesn't work well.\n\nThey attempted to do a 'deep' crafting system, but they ended up with a convoluted mess of a system with tons of materials with various qualities that simply don't make sense.  I appreciate them trying to do an intricate system but they completely forgot to include intuitive, logical systems.

This game has a lot of good ideas, however regardless of how many good ideas it has it's all for naught if the game isn't fun to play.\n\nIn this case, the thing that lets it down are janky controls. They feel unresponsive at sporadic intervals; with my character lurching around rather than gracefully sidestepping like I want it to. This problem is enough to mire whatever else could be great about the Repopulation. Regardless of whatever inspired ideas and glorious gameplay are contained within, the controls being so un-fun mean I cannot in good concience give this a favorable review until the controls are sorted.\n\nAs far as I'm aware the game has been alpha and beta tests for a long time already, and if the controls haven't been fixed at this stage, then I don't see any reason why the developer ever will. And that concerns me. The controls are pretty much the most important thing in a game. Whatever a person does in the game, whatever their interests, whatever they are or aren't interested in, they will still be involved in the fundamental control of their character. The controls are such a basic and rudamentary thing, that I cannot believe that a developer would not get basic movement fixed before moving on to other features.\n\nAll the other features are all good and well, but if I don't want to play the game becasue the controls are a slog, then I won't be here to enjoy any of the other features anyway.","August 28, 2015","false","21.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Between getting stuck on the edge of a handrail while jumping(go into stealth or change stance to crouch), to getting the first person scope overlay stuck on your screen all the way out to distant third person(go back to character select), to hostile raiders running into the giant tree for cover and firing out of it at you(retreat out of range so they charge out of their perma shield). Add in words that are plain out wrong (ofs where ifs should be ect.) this game just isn't at a point functionally where I'd really feel good paying more then $10 for it.\n\nThat being said, I love the massive skill/crafting/gathering system. It took me a couple hours to get my head around it, but as your knowledge of specific plants/recipes and you applicable skill increase you get better quality materials and make better items and equipment out of it. This is not as simple as it sounds, gather water and log trees then purify the water using the logs as a heat source, then breakdown logs with distilled water and some logs for the heat source to just to make glue. Combat is broken down into 4 melee, 6 ranged, 3 armor classes, plus tactical knowledges, multiple healing types, plenty of different pet-like things, driving and vehicle repair, stealth and awareness.\n\nIt's massive and I love it and it has so much promise, they need to pay a horde of english students to edit all the flavor and information text, preferably drop the entry price or make it a full demo until it's solidly in beta (I know devs, it hurts not getting the money but you'll get more good interest out of free then why did I pay $20)","August 6, 2015","false","24.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

The grind. Yes, RePop is a grindfest of epic proportions. A second job if you want to call it that.\n\nThe claim of the developers is that the game doesn't have XP at all. Rather that by using skills you randomly gain skill points for that skill. The end result is the same, you progress by repeating the same activity over and over. Some missions do reward skill points but these are far from the primary soruce of progression. In some ways this is actually worse than SWG when you think about it. You level defensive skills by taking damage, so to progress you have to allow yourself to get hit -- how is that meant to be fun? Want to level resource gathering? You need to spend time cracking rocks open one by one and chopping trees down by hand. At least in SWG you didn't need to sit there repeatedly clicking the screen to level gathering skills. You would actually get more fun out of MS Word.\n\nFor some bizzare reason they claim their crafting system is inspired by SWG. Don't be fooled! They have completely missed the spirit of what SWG had for crafting. Resources do not shift or change in the world. They are static resource nodes. The quality of the resource is defined by your skill in extracting it. They took the idea of item and resource quality from SWG but removed the best parts which made the SWG economy feel alive. A unique item is certainly produced, but only due to random bonus events which sometimes become available for the crafter to use. Player A and Player B can easily make exactly the same item due to the mechanics so there is no way for someone to gain a reputation for being an especially skilled crafter.\n\nSpeaking of skills. RePops developers claim that apparently characters have no levels and yet they do have levels for mobs. So that basically means that players DO have levels, but they aren't displayed. Someone needs to explain to them that no levels means that you stand an equal chance of defeating all enemies in the game equally unless they are intended to require multiple players. Again, the developers seem to be intentionally misleading players who haven't played the game yet.\n\nNext, you have the 'sandbox' element. True enough, you can go anywhere and do anything. Except that there isn't really anything to do. Your motivation? Gain levels. Collect stuff. Kleptomaniacs would love this but in this day and age MMOs have learned put enjoyable narratives alongside sandboxes and RePop doesn't do this. All missions are generic and there is no 'plot' which pulls you into this fictional world they claim to have crafted. It feels as if what made SWG enjoyable was its franchise and universe. RePop unfortunately lacks character and has a look and feel that is rather generic which contributes to its faults.\n\nIt actually kind of reminds me of Tabula Rasa in many ways... and that game didn't last long either.\n\nEarly development means there is room for change, but you would need to gut the game entirely and start over to get away from these failings and that isn't going to happen. I actually regret donating now, so save your cash until post-launch and see how popular the Repopulation is after a couple months.","April 24, 2015","false","7.9"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","3"

For now, I can sum my opinion up as "disappointed".\n\nIt's not an outright failure, but it's not a raving success either.\n\nMy problem with it is that I'm an adult, with adult responsibilities and duties in real life. There's something to be said for the "tried and true" algorithm  when it comes to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ming - everyone is at least partially familiar with it, it doesn't take a novel-length read to comprehend the basic essentials of game play and people can mostly jump right in and start playing... even if they don't have all the finer details down.\n\nThe Repopulation defies this, but in doing so, I feel will end up alienating a lot of potential players.\n\nThe phrase "easy to learn, difficult to master" doesn't apply here. The game is difficult to learn and somewhat impossible to master.\n\nThe tutorials are about as clear as mud, not because they're poorly written but because they have to explain every detail to you before you can even start to understand what the basic functions of the game are. The skills are some type of hybrid between the old UO system and their own specialized system of learning. You'll spend your first few hours totally lost, wondering why you can't do 90% of the things you thought you'd be able to, only to find there's some convoluted method to learning a simple skill.\n\nThings are just complicated for the sake of being complicated it seems. Item quality is another one here, as are skill levels. Different levels with other numbers, with an alphabetical listing or something or other... Christ! Just trying to figure out what almost every other MMO has made an essential part of their game brings on a rage-induce migraine in this game!\n\nCombine this with working a job, having a family and bills to pay.... you see where that disappointment comes from now?\n\nThis isn't just a game I can sit down and enjoy, and feel like I accomplished something... anything... in a couple of hours worth of play.\n\nThere are other issues that I could almost overlook if the core of the game was at lest enjoyable, which it is currently not:\n\nClones - Your character is a clone, so they got this right. Everyone looks like a clone of one another though. Armor is determined at the start and very little about it actually changes throughout the game. After 4 hours, I find myself getting tired and bored of looking exactly the same as I did when I first spawned into he game. other players also look the same... everyone looks the same.\n\nYou can customize your features, but that does little when you immediately cover them up with a full suite of armor.\n\nArmor - Whatever the hell determines heavy from medium, from light, is a total mystery. There are no indicators when you choose your armor and since you choose it before you see any skills, you really have nothing to go on when you initially start the game.\n\nIt also never changes. You get upgrades for it, but the actual armor never changes for anything different.\n\nCall me shallow, but the best idea of a graphical MMO (I played MUDs before this) is that you can see a graphical image of your character. You can mix and match things to look unique or have special functions that others can see... show off almost.\n\nSo when you see the "let's play" videos and screenshots of everyone playing the same characters,... yeah, that's really how it looks.\n\nMoon-gravity - Maybe because it's an alien planet? The gravity feels like a fraction of what it should be. You can jump off a ledge, straight, push a direction mid-air and change directions. Jumping feels slow and awkward. Animations in general seem slower than the actions should take.\n\nAll of those things might be "Alpha" issues but they add up.\n\nDay-night cycle - The concept isn't bad, but the only ting I've seen so far is its influence on NPC activity. Some go to bed for night, others come out to work, and so on.\n\nThis cycle only exaggerates another issue that relates to it and that is the questing. You don't have to complete quests, but it sure helps if you do. Unfortunately when you take a quest and find the guy you need to talk to went to sleep for the night, it puts a damper on your plans to actually finish the quest in any reasonable time frame.\n\nQuesting is already bad enough. Add to it, the headache of trying to time it with the day-night cycle and it's a completely unneeded, overly exaggerated pain in the ♥♥♥.","June 27, 2015","false","11.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","1"

It very complicated to build the most basic items.  I should not need to consult websites and excel spreadsheets just to craft.  That being said, if you love to craft you'll love this game.  It's difficult to get help in game.  99% of the time if I asked a question over crafting it was met with,"Go read the database".

There are only a few thousand items you can craft but each of those items requires atleast 10 parts each that you will have to craft from atleast another 3 components each. so consider chasing your tail for atleast 50 to 60 hours for each set of components to craft something. now if you thinking thats ok im not interested in crafting anyway ill just go and hunt well good luck with that too as the second you step foot outside the cities you die and that just keeps happening then you are stuck with death sickness which means you can never gain any skills and dont think you can just log off and back on again the sickness will still be there. then there is the remote possibility that you manage to survive long enough to kill something and gain a few level in the skills you use thats all well and good until you realise you need atleast 200 for the next weapon and more money then you can imagine so at the end of the day if you do get this game start with medium or heavy armor and get a medium range gun and be prepared to die alot like more then every 3 minutes.

So lets start, I'm a old school gamer as you can notice so I could write a very detailed review here to point out everything that can be good and bad but instead I will make a simpler review.\n\nI'm an old Ultima Online player and I was hoping this to be the next of the amazing gameplay that Ultima Online offered, but no I was wrong and I know that for sure because I have installed and played Ultima Online just to make sure and the game still is good and how it was before so I was very disappointed to say that I believe this game to be bad.\n\nFirst it was a kickstarter, then somehow their engine GOT ROBBED??? like WTF they lost their engine, how someone can be so irresponsible about their contracts and people they work with??? like I'm from Brazil and here we have much more professionalism than what was shown by the developers of this game.\n\nNow they will make a game that is like completely unrelated, It will be a FPS. Like wheres the RPG, wheres the building and fun stuff. In the Repopulation Game they made like tons of crafting ranks like who the **** would even bother to search for something so difficult to access. As the people of this planet evolve the gameplay must evolve as well.\n\nWe do not want a hard system, in fact we want easy systems that can cooperate with full gameplay time and half or quarter or weekly gameplay, like we want an afk gathering resource system (like "EVE"/"RF ONLINE" has). Also in Ultima Online we could always relay to UO Assist, Razor, Easy UO and Injection.\n\nSo yeah, the pvp was not even half the adrenaline you had in Ultima Online. Like, the first person mode was okay but the rest was very very bad. Like skills system to evolve was bad itself. It needed an afk lvling system to work with the world of 2016. (like "EVE" has).\n\nStill I'm not fan of EVE, I'm old school rpg gamer like I've played all the Fallouts and ... not going into details as I said in the title... hope this help you.","February 7","false","8.6"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","1"

I may change my mind once it releases but currently, no, it's not a worthwhile purchase unless you specifically want to support the project. I wish Steam gave the option of a caveat and not just a yes/no choice in this matter as while i cannot recommend the game in it's current state, it is still something quite unique in the current mmo genre and is to be commended for trying to do something old school and not follow the usual mmo cookie-cutter path.\n\nThe main problem is this game relies on an active community of players to drive the economy and the social aspects of the game, currently the population on EU is around 20-30 players at peak times which renders the ecnonomy sterile and the world more so.\n\nTheir biggest problem and the main reason for this is there will be a server wipe pre-launch, so anyone who owns the game is staying away as there is no point in playing or progressing as it'll be wiped. This is cyclical as you can imagine. No players, no economy, no social aspects to a player economy driven social centric mmo.\n\nAdditionally the likenesses made to SWG should be taken with a pinch of salt. SWG without the Star Wars aspect loses a massive amount of it's draw. The crafting in TR is touted as deep, but it's not really the case, it's just unnecessarily complicated.\n\nPlayers complain of lag and latency issues, which i also experienced although not as bad as some have claimed. My computer is high spec as well, It seems the issues are client side. Most likely poor optimisation but this is to be expected from an alpha really.\n\nThe combat is one of it's biggest flaws, i have hopes they will improve it pre-launch but right now it's pretty basic, glitchy and feels extremely dated and clunky. For a game that claims to emulate SWG it's mildly annoying that it's combat is inferior to a game that predates it by about 12 years.\n\nWith beta approaching i still have hopes the devs will step-up and fix the multitude of problems, but the real issue for me is its impossible to know how this game will be come release. If nothing changes, it might be a serious flop and thats a concern for anyone invested in games of this type.","August 8, 2015","false","1.6"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

It was as if development had no focus towards optimization at all, and the animations were choppy, insanely simplistic, the control layout sucked, the emotes were dry or stupid, the walking to foot movement speed ratio was off significantly, and the questing and interface interactions were sour. It was a great attempt at a game, but it's just not cutting it. We'll see later, considering I payed for this, maybe it'll end up being worth my time.

For example for $5,000 you get a TOTAL of 50 slots, for $15,000 you get a TOTAL of 75 slots.  If you buy the 50 slot upgrade, the 75 slot STILL costs $15,000.\n\nThe amount of storage available to you is ridiculously small when you take into account the sheer number of things REQUIRED to make a single item.

I'm not asking for a theme-park;  but something needs to be in place to help guide players on what they should be doing after the tutorial, during the tutorial.\n\nThe mail system for missions seems place-holder, and the animations are clunky.  Yes, yes -- I know it's Early Access.  But it's been known that most people who opt. in to EA generally will never see it finished, or still feel incomplete when it has its initial release.\n\nSo then why am I stating it's not a bad game?..  Well because it has potential.  There's a lot of growing room here, and I hope that players of both SWG's and not can balance out what they both want for the Repopulation.\n\nI'll update this review once the game releases a few more builds and see where it's going.","January 18, 2015","false","3.1"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","0"

I dont think theres even any PvP.\n\nSure its alpha but with the amount of features they already have in place you'd expect at least a handful of players to be willing to group at peak time but such is not the case; this just spells out a fundamental flaw in the game to me and heralds a poor launch.\n\nTotally regret dumping my money on this :/","January 3, 2015","false","160.7"," 17 of 44 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","17","44","0","10"

In reality a lots of basic interface functions doesn't work. If you jump on the wall you stuck..if you jump on the tree you stuck...you can stuck everywhere... The trees mesh cooliders are simple boxes instead of complicated meshes what means that you can't walk next to tree... This indicates how simplistic this project is...\nObjects disappear randomly...example...I attached harvester to mining node I walk few steppes away then I came back and... node wasn't even visible...(btw it didnt despawned) the object coolider was still there, my harvester still worked but becasue I couldn't click on the object I couldn't take my ore.... node object itself was not visible...only reloging fixed it...but its quite annoying have to relog every time when you coming to mining node(big one for harvesters) and want to use it....\nOnce for a few minutes character can't stop harvesting/interacting with objects.... the only way to unfreeze him is use /stuck or relog... you can go into stealth and this will free your character but still you can only move in one direction -.- so anyway you have to relog or do teleport to the city....\nBesides... anyone who played ANY other professional MMOPRG will noticed very fast that game really looks not very good... it looks cheap....and rough.... like kind of game anyone can make in Unity engine with few cheap/free props...\nFirst time when I launched this game my character was next to me,.. I could move it but...my camera was in different spot...I could see my character on map moving into the wall as I pushed "W" but my screen was still static and could do nothing except starring into frozen camera......or next time when I logged I got instant message that due to being AFK I was logged out.... -.-\nAfter conversation with NPC your camera movement using right mouse button stops working.... Normally in any mmorpg people use "W" to move forward and they just choose direction by using right mouse button and changing camera direction... here after conversation with NPC it stops working and you have to click ESC or use left mouse button for a while....\nI had a lots of "fun" when trying to turn in a quest to moving NPC.... I was getting all the time message that target is out of range...that was interesting......and when finally I succeeded... I noticed terrified that this NPC is going to give me some long conversation....so, I was running after him , trying to click "right" answers when the window with answers was moving around screen together with NPC.......\nGame it self looks like very cheap amateur production done by few enthusiasts friends in spare time.... cheaply done props... and not optimized engine and despite this facts still very bad performance, constant freezes when moving even around low populated areas....(servers had green status when I tested it)\nCharacter customization basically doesn't exists....\nVery not comfortable map to use... bugged skills, like example this tracking... it supposed to show NPC around....but it will NOT show your quest target NPC's ...\nMobs instead of moving they teleporting towards you... blinking around......\nWhen you unlock and move your character icon with HP bar in different spot than default , after clicking ESC it will come back to default position....\n\n\nWell, it's still ALPHA stage but I don't understand this huge optimistic enthusiasm and this all talking about game is "almost finished"..... game is far from being near to finish....\n\nThere is a few good ideas in this game...nice , complicated crafting system.... which I guess is going to be main focal point for most of players who want to try something different than EVE.... maybe skilling process is also interesting.... but that's it....\nFighting , shooting, moving really discourage from playing, I really can't see it working during any mass battles or even small pvp...\n\nThis game require a lot of work to become something interesting and playable enough for players to enjoy it...\n\nFor now do I recommend this game ?

All crafting is based on Ultama online; if you ever played that crap, and Partly on Starwars; so I hear.\n\nWhat ever the crafting system is based on it is 110% confusing. To make obect A1 you have to buy 1 thing plus make 4 other items, of the 4 items you have to gather more stuff to make those plus buy sgents and wire, then you learn there is more to make out of the 4 items, 2 require other skills in other crafting lists that require you to make and gother other crap to make those, for which by the time you have figured out what you are gather inther for the 5th item you needed to make for A1 you have long forgotten what the Fk you was making to begin with\n\nFollow me?

I understand this is early access and the final Alpha testing phase but that does not account for how bad the core game looks and feels. There are bugs, which is understandable, these can be ironed out and fixed through the Alpha and beta. The mob AI and pathing is very weak but I believe I did see a post from the dev's saying this is one thing to be updated later. The graphics and game play however, I think the game needs to go back to square one with a new engine and artists (Trying not to be rude to the artists, but they really should look into something called colour! Large portions of  grass, mountains, buildings are black, which is also the primary colour for players and most mobs. Seriously it hurts my eyes at times.) The performance seems rather poor, given there are very few NPC's and players. I expect spikes, crashes and disconnects but being stood still with players/mobs jerking past in the open is not what I would expect, nothing seems to flow smoothly.\n\nCrafting: Very complicated, too complicated for an average gamer I imagine. Personally I don't mind this, I think it can help the community stronger, force players and nations to work more closely.  It is very confusing and I would hope to see more detailed tutorials played out in the beta's. Where crafting falls down is that you obviously need to gather materials before you can craft; Gathering is boring, looting the same flower three or four times, killing mobs in mind numbing combat, running around an ugly world. I struggle to find a reason to explore when everything looks so bad right now.\n\nSandbox: My “sandbox” experience was rather disappointing. The first training zone seemed a small instanced area and then loaded into a new city area. A quest in this city sends you to visit an apartment/tower block, which was also instanced! A building in the main city is instanced, even though it seemed to lead to one room with one NPC? Then there were quests to go to another zone and housing area which are also seemed to be separate instances/areas.\n\nConclusion:\nFor modern day gamers and MMO fans, I would advise avoid this game, certainly for this phase. I think the game requires a large investment of resources to make the graphics and game play enjoyable.  I believe The Re-population, as things stand, will have a small niche market of retro ex Star Wars galaxies fans who really don't mind playing something without the graphics and game play we have come to expect from games in the last 10 to 15 years.\n\nPersonally I will check back in a few months to see how the artists have changed the textures, colours, animations and how smooth the game runs; hopefully I will come back and find the game has ported over to the CryEngine – then I’m sure I will be happy.","December 28, 2014","false","21.2"," 17 of 46 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","17","46","0","1"

To make many of the items you will need to get components from literally every discipline.  It's not clear how well this will function once the game goes live but right now you end up grinding a lot of skills so you can make components you didn't want to make so you can make the components that you did want to make.\n\nThe developers overall do a good job of communicating with the players.  I can't say they use the best "tweaking" methods.  For example:  You aren't supposed to be able to automatically get the highest quality resources, you are supposed to search for them then use your acquired skills to improve them.  Well, in one patch they significantly reduced the quality of resources to be found while simultaneiously making resource improvement more difficult AND making improving your skill with resource improvement more difficult.","August 11, 2015","false","603.1"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","0"

Well a lot of things don't work and it makes it very difficult to enjoy the alpha build.\n\nThe main draw of this game is going to be the extensive crafting system which will requires lots of time and resources to get to. Not going in to that in 10 hours of exploration/experimentation.\n\nGAMEPLAY ISSUES\n- Graphics: It's like we went back in time to 2004. The graphics are dated, the textures are muddy, it looks quite horrible. I don't think I can stand much more than 1-2 hour sessions at a time. Frame rates dip drastically between zones when i assume loads new assets into the game, but then the client stutters and freezes and continues to do so until you quit the application and restart.\n- Crafting requires lots of experimentation, which also means that you have to spend hours gathering material or killing things. Not seeing much fun in either ventures in the current build. Some people love this sort of thing but I don't see the point in spending so much time to build a basic weapon early on. Sucks all the fun out of the game for casual crafters.\n- Background Music: I turned it off. It was quite annoying.\n- Controls / UI: Clunky. Half of the time all the buttons stop animating so you have to reset the game to resolve UI glitches. WASD makes the character move, but the camera leaves little to be desired. When walking into rooms with low ceilings i tend to clip the floors or have to zoom into first person to see anything. I play the game at isometric aerial view because it gives me better spatial awareness. Playing over the shoulder or in first person gives me headaches.\n- Poor navigation / pathfinding: The game needs better cartographic elements. Symbology is also rubbish. The mini map also do not reflect the landmarks on the ground so it's a constant struggle to find important NPCs and places of interest. Developer needs to take cartographic lessons and map making classes. You're expected to use your tracking skill to locate certain NPCs, man i could not be bothered after an hour or so running around the city spamming that tracking button.\n- Frustrating learning curve because of cryptic tutorials / quest information. Job offered to player: Go to A and pick up package to delivery to B. No information as to where A or B is. Up to you to track down A and figure out where B is. Reward is not worth the effort.\n- No audio feedback: Fire a weapon, no audio. Monster attacks you, no audio.\n- Questing system is a chore, and you struggle to do basic fetch, delivery and kill quests because of insufficient information. These are staple game mechanics in sandbox MMOGs and it struggles to even deliver basic missions.\n- Looting needs to be quicker. Right now it takes up to 5 seconds to begin the looting process, then a window takes over the screen. If you cross into the path of another beast, you begin your attack rotation but then the loot screen from your previous action blocks your view. You die.\n- Extracting process needs to be quicker/efficient. Took me a long time to figure out what "enhance corpse" and "enrich nodes" meant. It is more of a hassle in hostile zones too because you're taking around 30 seconds between corpses trying to improve the grade of the corpse, and then you cross the path of a hostile  roaming player / monster, and you die.\n- On the advice of many people playing the alpha, I skipped the crafting and focused only on combat jobs and killing things. There are other job offers that are sent to your mailbox but I lost all motivation to do them because of the struggles with finding NPCs and places of interest.\n\nCOMBAT\n- Roleplayed a sniper. Take a rifle out in to the woods. Interesting that the damage varies depending on distance between you and the target. Problem arise when monster agro circle is larger than the optimal range of my weapon. So you run into the monster's range, it starts attacking you before you can pull off your first shot. The monster is in your face and you're doing minimal damage. You die.\n- Automatic weapons is ok, but the optimal range is basically in your face. If you're not heavily armored, you die.\n- Didn't try other weapons.\n- Found a level 26 goat in a level 10 zone. Didn't realise it was that much more difficult until I agro'd it. What's up with that? I don't mind that a higher level monster is in the zone, but nothing indicates that it was more difficult until I started attacking it (the "level" of the monster didn't show till it was attacking me) and obviously i died.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION\nAt this stage i do not recommend it. The alpha build is not fun and there are many gameplay elements that do not do the current build any favours.\n\nIt is currently not worth my time to continue testing as it was quite disappointing.\n\nPicked up the game during Steam 2014 Christmas sales at $33. I regret this purchase when there are alternative sandbox MMOGs available.","December 26, 2014","false","9.3"," 14 of 40 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","14","40","0","1"

When I saw early access on steam I opened my wallet and decided to give it a go... it took me a single session of frustration to realize what a mistake I had made and what a lie the advertising has been.\n\nWhere to start... well first thing you will notice is character creation.  Simply put, it is awful.  It is one of those systems that is intended to make the player feel like you have unlimited customization but in the end still cannot produce the result you want.  The player is given lots of meaningless options but even then it is frustrating to control (more on this later) as it is one of "those" character creators where adjusting one slider pushes three others.  Character design is ultimately unappealing so you better like wearing your helmet.  The entire character creator (and the character models for that matter) needs to be rebuilt from the ground up IMO.\n\nMy next and probably largest complaint is with the controls and interface.  Much like character creation, we are given the illusion of lots of choice, but none of the choices we want or need.  I found myself wrestling with the controls constantly... not a good sign and it really takes away from getting into the game.  Remember the smooth, user friendly controls and interface from SWG that felt good to the touch and allowed you to become easily immersed in the world?  Apparently this design team does not.  Being able to ALT between mouse mode and third person would be a huge step in the right direction, but merely scratching the surface of what requires a complete overhaul.\n\nGraphics:  Well, in fairness one should not expect too sophisticated of graphics from any MMORPG if you want complexity in the world while maintaining playability.  But some of the design choices here are just.... baffling.  The aspect ratios and fonts are such that I was suffering eyestrain and a headache after a mere 2 hours of play.  On top of that, the world is drab and lifeless aesthetically.  All browns and greys.  Lots of darkness.  It simply does not LOOK interesting.  Already mentioned that the characters look like garbage.  I do not kid that in addition to the physical discomfort I felt a bit depressed after playing for a couple hours from looking at such an uninspired landscape and world.\n\nThe game world is horribly scaled, a trend I see shared with more and more MMOs of recent times.  By this I mean, every structure you enter is enormous and out of proportion... large vacant spaces with colossal head space and lots of meaningless filler.  Remember in SWG, you would enter a structure and the proportions made sense?  The rooms were filled with items in what appeared a logical and meaningful way?  When you walked the streets of say, Coronet, nearly all of the buildings had some function and the scale of it all made sense?  This new style of MMO world gives us big, vacuous structures meant to provide the illusion of vastness.  It asks you to walk 3 minutes from one drab structure which is identical to the next in order, save for some stupid billboard outside.\n\nTo further compound the frustration of the experience, I could still feel the "rails" beneath it all.  This game is by no means a true sandbox in any sense.  It may have some sandbox-like qualities, but to compare it to SWG is an insult.  I was getting more of a "Star Trek Online" and "Old Republic Online" vibe from this game.  If you are a fan of those games but prefer a drab, lifeless, brandless sci-fi setting, then this may be the game for you.\n\nIf you came looking for the next SWG...... "move along".","February 27, 2015","false","15.0"," 6 of 23 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","6","23","0","2"

First it is a hero engine game which they don't tell you until you buy it so the gameplay is miserable and graphics are bad.  I run an extremely top end rig 3x GTX 980s Haswell 8 core, 64 gigs of ram and the graphic lag makes it nearly impossible to even tell where I am running.  The combat and interface just feel soft and make very little sense I.E. sometime you need to right click something, sometimes it is a double left click something you need to double click an item, click a question mark, double click another item to install it and half the time the window gets stuck on the screen requiring you to log in and out.  I understand this is an alpha but this game is in the closed alpha stage where no one except developers should be playing it.  The fact that it has been in development for several years and is going to be released on the hero engine platform make this game a complete waste of time.

The skill system is straight out of every Elder Scrolls game, resource mining is straight out of every WoW clone and it honestly doesn't have anything in common with SWG other than being a science fiction game.\n\nEven for an alpha this feels unpolished.  Worse, it feels empty.  Under the graphics (which are nice) there is just a repetition of the same standardized MMO systems that we've already seen a hundred times before.  Much has been lauded about the complex crafting system, but that can't make up for the fact that this is not a sandbox game by any sense of the genre.  It is, rather, a traditional theme-park game that just hasn't had the rides installed yet.\n\nAlso, lead developer J.C.Smith is rather touchy about making sure that everyone thinks this game is the "spiritual heir" to SWG, because he's banking heavily on old SWG players buying his product.  To that end he will happily delete & ban people simply for mentioning that http://www.swgemu.com even exists, lest his desired customers find out about and go play the real thing instead.  That attitude of placing greed above all else is about as unprofessional as it gets, and is a terrible way to dump on people who've already paid for the product.  Likewise I am sure that, after reading this, he will go petition Steam themselves to delete this very review for those same reasons.\n\nThe bugs I can forgive, for such is expected in alpha releases, but the flagrant marketing deception, the lack of true innovation and the terrible attitute by the staff are enough to earn it a well-deserved thumbs down even if the game was already fully finished.\n\nDon't make the same mistake I did - give this one a pass and keep looking elsewhere.

We are told to expect bugs and an overall unfinished product. This game will be a free to play business model whenever it finally 'releases'. As such, I don't know what possessed me to plop $40 of my hard earned money on this game, and I sincerely wish I could get a refund.\n\nFirst, before the Fanboys start the flaming, let me say I am a hardcore SWG fan and played the game from initial release until the end, and let me say this game does a good job at recreating the general feel of SWG right down to the UI. But something is lacking.\n\nI find it ireprehensible that this game is in such a horrid state of development after the amount of money people have pourd into it and the amount of time the game has been in development. The development of this game began in 2008...yes, almost seven years ago. It's 2015 now and we are no closer to release then we were in 2010 when they switched engines for this game.\n\nThe problems of this game start in character creation. with the general premise of the game, I understand there is only one race, humans. Thats fine. The issue is in the general lack of options. The control scheme in creation isnt very intuitive, and your face always looks the same. The only real way to change the general look is to make your character fat or skinny and slap facial hair on them. Even after that they still look like shiny claymation characters.\n\nThen you get in the gameworld and get to stumble through the shoddy tutorial. SWG honestly had better graphics and ran jus as choppy. and how old is SWG. Also, when you get in game you realize the terrain is horrendous, the rocks and stones look like cardboard and the grass looks like pipecleaners. The town's feel vacant. Most NPC's don't serve a purpose or show any signs of AI. When you get into combat, the laser effects are downright cheap and goofy.\n\nThe premise for this game is great, the vision is epic and the spirit of SWG is there, but after close to seven years of development and a lot of consumer investment, I expect better than this rough shod heap. If you are thinking about paying $40 for an Alpha, remember it's an alpha...seriously. And there are no signs after playing it there will be a release any time soon.","January 20, 2015","false","4.1"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","7","26","0","1"

You close them all and 10 seconds you're flooded again. The "tutorial" area is a show off features and teach you nothing. Multiple styles of graphics thrown together that dont fit. A lot of cool ideas but it needs a ton of polishing before its playable, enemies skip around the screen-- I could see if being a free alpha test but right now it doesn't have a lot going for it.\n\nAs an update after additional playing I find the game has several interesting features but very little meat to the features they've set in place. You're heavily bombarded with tons and tons of various things but after digging into them more it feels hollow.

Other than that you play the same missions over and over again until you progress enough to move on to the next area.\n\nSandbox, ha thats funny.

I've been missing SWG for some time.  At first I thought it was great, it feels a lot like SWG, interface looks very much like it and the combat feels like it too.  But the more I played the more frustrated I became.  To me the game feels like it has not depth just circular complexity.   The crafting system is in depth in a way but where  SWG's made sense this one seems to invent complexity and compounds it with no real beneficial outcome.  There is no real logical reason for the way they've developed the crafting and it got on my nerves.  No one can be a crafter unto themselves but it just felt like every profession needed 10 different other professions to make the simplist of components so you could make an item finally.

If you don't like unnecessarily complicated crafting, don't play it. If you don't like spending the majority of your in-game time harvesting resources of unnecessarily largley varying "quality", don't play it.\nLet's also dispel the myth that this is SWG reborn. Nonsense. I played SWG for years and this game does not even come close. In some ways it is similar, but so are other games. Yet still it seems that nobody has learned the positive lessons SWG put out there about sandbox games.\nCrafting is an absolute joke. To make one simple T1 component (one of several needed to make a basic item) is a real exercise in patience and/or frustration. The game relies on you being able to by certain parts or resources from other players, and you can't. Not with the current player base at least. All crafting is also carried out at a generic crafting station that seems capable of such diverse tasks from bio engineering to simple woodwork. Ridiculous.\nCombat is dull and uninteresting. It has 2 modes, classic rpg and "action" (direct aim etc). Neither of them work particularly well. And watching the trajectory of your high powered sniper rifle bullet as it bends and twists it's flight path (slow one at that) to follow your target like some sort of mini homing missile, gets rather annoying after a while.\nLots of missions to do, all the same thing though. They repeat over and over and over.\nThe world is large, looks ok, and is well populated by some imaginative denizens. Most of which will tear you to pieces early on when you get sick and tired of running around the same city for ages and attempt to go somewhere else.\nThe stats system? Stupid. Its all down to whatever "fittings" you slot in your armor and weapons. I think this is a pre-cursor to a free2play model in the future where fittings will be available in some kind of ingame store etc. I don't know.\nAll in all, a bad game with great potential. It is boring and repetitive when starting out, you cant craft anything worth while and will spend most of your time chopping logs just to make some money to repair gear or buy fittings. It will not hold the interest of anyone of average intelligence for long. Watch this space though, it could get better. For now though, save your money. This game is not worth anywhere near the asking price. Its still in early access of course, but nevertheless, not worth the same cost as a full release game","February 8, 2015","false","40.2"," 6 of 25 people (24%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","24","6","25","2","2"

The UI/UX is a disaster. It's hideous, difficult to read, and it's shocking how many actions are just called the wrong thing in the keybinds. What is a "Face" action and why does Alt+X or whatever the default is not do it? All I wanted to do was find a keybind for switching between the RPG "mode" and Action "mode," and I couldn't decypher the made up phrases.\n2. I'm the kind of MMO player that might read 2 words of quest/mission text, per MMO. I just want you to tell me what to do and I'll go do it. Although it seems like it's plausible you could do that with this game, the first quest I did there was a survey pop up reminiscent of, "HEY BRO, WHAT'D YOU THINK OF THAT QUEST?" You mean the quest where I literally clicked the same button 3 times in a row? It was fantastic, for a click-this-button-3-times quest.\n3. This switchable RPG to Action mode? I only got to the shooting training thing, and maybe I didn't get far enough to understand it, but it's still RPG style. It's basically "do you want to tab target people or do you want to miss a whole lot because we have a broken aiming reticule?" That's the only reason I bought the early access, to see how this worked, and I was immediately disappointed.\n\nMy biggest problem:\n3. The game, as a whole, is ugly. This isn't a slight on the graphics in terms of the quality, but art style choice. The models move horrendeously. During the character customization most of the outfits made my character look like he added about 50 pounds on the outfit selection screen. There's just walls of text all over my screen as part of the UI, and the font choice makes it so I literally had to stop moving, take my hands off the keyboard mouse, and concentrate on what I'm reading. The whole thing is just terrible looking. It looks like the entire art department for the dev studio just got hired out of a community college video game development program's freshmen class.

Potential for intrigue and politics; an actual death mechanic! Loss of items! WOW. Finally! A game to replace my glory days in Ultima Online battling reds in the Britain graveyard.\n\nHowever, the execution of the game leaves much to be desired, and it's quite clear to me now that the developers are making a game without designing it from the ground up to be what they are advertising it as, in order to draw that same tired demographic out.\n\nConcerns:\n\n- The animations for movement feel unnatural; there is no transition from moving to not moving, so your character almost seems sp.astic (sp.astic is filtered? Weird) in the way they move.\n\n- First person is not actually first person. You're off to the side of your head, and if you look down, you see your entire character. It's very, very weird. Not sure if this was intended or not? Maybe it's just me.\n\n- The UI needs a redesign, or some significant tweaks. Nothing is intuitive. Everything is dull, drab, and feels very much like older versions of an operating system; functional, but by comparison to modern aesthetics, not very pleasing.\n\n- The entire reason I bought the game was based on the fact that it was being advertised as a replacement for old hardcore MMOs like UO/SWG; however, the hardcore ruleset doesn't even appear to exist yet. The game's community from my brief foray into it feels like it is being dragged in the complete opposite than the advertised direction, with constant concern about PvE and player safety, and "consensual pvp," etc. This feeling is validated by the fact that the game doesn't even appear to have a hardcore ruleset yet, and that "hardcore" appears to be altered version of the "normal" ruleset that the game is TRULY designed for (why else would you design a game from the ground up without one of it's core features?). I am really incredulous that the developers are choosing to advertise a game as being inspired by one of the most brutal experiences in MMO history (Ultima Online) and yet it appears to be designed from the ground up for PvE players, with PvP AGAIN as an after thought.\n\nNot only is it an afterthought, the hardcore ruleset is not even a core feature:\n\n"Most of the major features are already in game, though they are still being refined and streamlined.\n\nThings that aren't yet integrated include things like Underground levels to cities, underwater/flying AI improvements, city points system, the Horticulture line,raid groups, and things of that nature. All the core features though (combat, skills, missions, engagements, vehicles, pets, nations (guilds), crafting, harvesting, etc) are already in game and functional." - J.C. Smith (http://steamcommunity.com/app/322300/discussions/0/620700960324929878/)\n\nThere you have it. The hardcore ruleset is not a core feature. They're all in game.\n\nThat said, I cannot currently recommend The Repopulation. I've been watching it for some time and been quite excited to finally get my hands on it, but when I got too close and started actually learning about the game, it became clear that this was yet another game that would shoot itself in the foot trying to appeal to the same group of players that have plagued MMO's since World of Warcraft released; a dense swarm of flesh eating locusts, that will devour every last piece of "content" off the bones that they can, and demand more, ensuring that players interact with one another in the most shallow and facile way they possibly can, completely negating the entire purpose of an online world where players should be interacting.\n\nEven when the game is polished further and a number of the above concerns are dealt with, you still have a dev team that is compromising their vision for the same petulant children that have haunted and perpetually annihilated this genre over the last decade and a half.\n\nSee you guys in Star Citizen.","December 23, 2014","false","0.6"," 41 of 105 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","41","105","0","14"

Well, I can already see that it goes nowhere. Developers won't be able to balance such a complex game where most things are unnecessary and exist just for appearance. Another still born MMORPG. RIP.\n\nOverly complicated game with lots of systems involved. Pets, robots, vehicles, weapons, implants, housing and you can continue forever. It only sounds interesting. Developers doesn't even know why do you need all those in the game. They've put it all in the game just as a customer bait. They don't have any idea how all these system interact. And they are already confused themselves. Good luck with balance.\n\nBest example is melee weapons. It's totally useless. No one knows why it is in-game. It means developers first decided that melee should be in the game, but still haven't decided why. Rock-paper-scissors? No, they never heard about it. They will invent something new and horrible.\n\nLevelling and progression is awful. There are so many skills and items that affect char's combat effectiveness that you can't even tell whether someone is stronger or weaker than you. You can get a taste of it in starter town where some mobs are too easy, some are too tough, and you can't even tell the difference until you die.\n\nYou get nice popups with skill increase every couple of minutes. They mean nothing. They just create a fake visibility of character development. But actually you need to get 100 of those to notice some slight changes. Means grind. Lots of grind. Forever. Ever. And more than that. There is a skill for every recipe, every resource, every ingridient, every ... thing. You have to level them up all. And good luck finding out how they affect anything and each other.\n\nAnd even if you increased your skill up to 100 you won't get new abilities. You can see them in skill description. But you can't have them. You have to do quests which will randomly give you some random abilities for random skills. And you won't even be able to tell which ability goes for which skill. Or you can BUY them for some "stars" which are probably will be available for real money, I'm sure.\n\nUnreasonably complex crafting. Most recipes don't make any sense. You can't craft anything on your own. Too many skills and components needed to craft simplest usable thing. All you can do is craft more components. And you don't even know why do you need them. Harvesting resources. Well, you can harvest nodes, mob remains. But be prepared to waste an hour trying to find any use for an items you got from them.\n\nCombat is meh. FPS mode is useless. Typical MMORPG. Target and cast.\n\nArmor and weapon progression is based on boosters. Means you can't craft a super awesome pair of boots. You craft simple boots and put several boosters on them. Totally not visual. You won't get any idea who's against you from his looks.\n\nQuest system reminds a spam bot. From time to time you suddenly get a message that you fail something. Just ignore it. Oh, but you won't get new abilities then.\n\nWell, all those things I listed is basics. And basics are already flawed.

You need to review what is present, and not what it may, or in fact may not become. This is a sandbox game that isn't quite delivering on the promise of open world freedom. The reality is that beneath the veneer of choice. Is a virtual lack thereof. In a lot of ways it is the worst of two worlds. Either the game demands an obscene amount of interdependency to get anything done, or its so simplistic a cave man can do it. If you will pardon the pun.\n\nI am torn as to whether the combat is laughable or awful. The game supports two combat styles first person mode, or the standard hot button mode. The problem with the first is that while it makes it easier to navigate it makes combat pretty easy as it make decissions for you. The problem with the second is while it is somewhat more challenging it is also more of a pain to use to navigate. Not that it matters either way virtually no strategy or movement is required. Either you are going to dominate or you are going to die.\n\nThe loot system is perhaps the worst I have ever seen, and it has nothing to do with the odds involved with random rolls. This game makes use of a slot machine that can take between thirty or forty seconds to finish its roll. Just to give you a random loot that probably wont apply. In other words you will not only have to wait for loot, but it wont even be close to being something you might be able to use.  What you end up doing is spinning for quality of you know not what, at least if you knew. Then you could decide in advance to abandon the roll, and abandon the corpse.\n\nThe reason for this awful loot system is the horribly convoluted crafting system. That is predicated on a slavish devotion to a perverse notion of interdependency. Crafters are relegated to nothing more then cogs in a machine. Everyone can craft, but nobody can make something on their own. There are at least half a dozen harvesting lines in the game, and it is a foregone conlusion that if a schematic requires three ingredients that all three ingredients will require different kinds of harvesting, and at least one, and possibly two will require an intermediate refining before they can be used, and all of that is the case if you are lucky. You might be unlucky, and one of the ingredients might be a crafted component that has to be purchased from another player, and well if one isn't up for sale wow it really sucks to be you.\n\nWorse still for the crafter, and the resultant buyer the quality of ingredients matters, and they are the product of random rolls. So as it stands the real question should be why have the crafting system at all. Is the crafter supposed to wait for an accomplished harvester to get a few good rolls, and what of the other crafter, and what if their rolls don't pan out. It is a recipe for conniption fits if I saw one.\n\nBeyond all of that however. The user interfase is pretty abysmal. I mean basic functionality isn't even there.  I hope that is temp music we are hearing, and that they intend for it to be instance appropriate, and the graphics are pretty bad in a lot of ways. It is one thing for the world to be muddy, but the animals are too, and seeing as how everything is hostile it is a pretty big problem.\n\nPotential or not there are some pretty bad design philosophies present in this build, and while I would love to play a real successor to star wars galaxies. Which is what this developer is going after. What made that game fun wasn't so much its complexities as much as it was the sense of freedom, and this game doesn't seem to be promoting freedom of choice. It is forcing crafters to network, boring combat players with idiotic looting systems, and the combat isn't very involved. It could get better, but then again it could get worse, and I am concerned it will be the latter.\n\nIt is a sad fact of life that a number of sandbox players just don't have any life to speak of, and they often operate under the delusion that theirs is a common playstyle. A lot of the testers don't appear to be making allowances for this, and are likely to encourage the developer to keep the system as is, because it favors their style of play while punishing the player that has a life outside of the game.\n\nI can't really recommend this game at this time. There is a lot of mindless grinding, but not much else to recommend it. It  is so hard in some regards, and so terribly easy in others. That it is a hard place to have much fun. You shouldn't pay much attention to the positive reviews. Most of them are coming from ex star wars galaxies players who are going on a decade thirsty for a proper title in the genre. It is to be expected that they would be far more forgiving, and frankly far easier to give themselves over to self delusion.\n\nThat all said there is hope in the developer. As they seem to be very responsive, and they seem to be very attentive. It is usually a good sign when the developers are listening closely.  Which is why I intend to revisit the game periodically to see if it is improving. If it manages to do that I will probably amend this review.","January 8, 2015","false","15.0"," 6 of 28 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","6","28","0","2"

This game sounded interesting, then I bought it. Most of the quests don't give clear directions as to where you need to go, and the ones that seem simple enough end up not working right. I had two quests to kill vultures but the descriptions didn't give clear directions as to where these vultures were at. I found plenty of vultures around the starting area, killed about 50, and none of them counted for either quest. Got a quest to escort a lady to a camp down the road and she just stood there. There was no indication in the quest log saying there was a command that need to be given to get her to move either. Picked up the animal taming skill and tamed a wierd mutant dog. It kept getting injured and I was seeing a notification that it need to be healed but I wasn't told how or where. Then there's the crafting. I love crafting in any game but it seems like the developers just tried purposely to make the crafting in this game so hard that you'd give up on it. It takes forever to get the materials for crafting, the skills go up slowly, and half of the things you need for crafting you can't find the recipes for and the npc's in the game are no help. It's just confusing. You need 10 different components just to make a crappy low level piece of armor. After just a few hours of playing this game I gave up and had to write this stupid review, and I hate writing reviews.

Star Trek Online takes a while to load... but this game I recommend loading it up, logging in and then going and reading war and peace.\n\nTrying again... first time loading I guess it got sleepy and shut its self down, or in other words "The game I couldn't play... is still unplayable."\n\nSo far my experience with this game has been Purchased, downloaded, attempt to connect : game crashes out, connect again : same results, ect ect.\n\nConnection finally established, and I'm able to get in game, Music was a bit loud for me at first but thats personal preference, I like it, it's good music all the same. It provides a nice background to the character creation screen.\n\nSpeaking of character creation, and speaking in general I'm guessing the character voices aren't all implimented just yet as I only had a few options on the male side of characters only, also I found the camera to rotate your character while building them was a little sensitive to movement, makes it a bit tough to line up the angle you may want at first but it's easy enough to pick up after a bit of practice.\n\nThe overall options for character creation seem so far to be rather indepth although with the body shape options I have a small gripe about the connected sliders, where moving one causes another to shift in relation to how you move the one, while not a big issue I've just never liked that sort of feature.\n\nGAHH FLOATING EYES AND TEETH!\n\nSome of the hair looks a bit unnatural, but none of it is terrible.\n\nSome options for armor are missing but I'm chalking all missing content up as "Going to be put in later."\n\nI've noticed that mixing and matching certain sets of starting armor leaves invisibility gaps in the model that lets the background shine through.\n\nAfter completing my character I have to say though limited in number of options the options they do give you are expansive, allowing you to tailor make yourself a character for the most part.\n\nFinally I can get into game and what happens, the camera glues its self to my characters ♥♥♥ and now I can't get it to zoom in or out anymore...

Compared to other Beta games that I've played... there is no comparison. IMO The Repopulation's Early Access Beta is still in Alpha testing.\n\n2) You have tones of gaming time to waist on developing a robust character that has no place in the simplistic and redundant world the game takes place in. They went way too heavy on developing an extremely complicated, confusing and complex character build, recipe and crafting system that takes HOURS to understand and absolutely no effort, imagination or originality on developing the game world, enemies or NCPs that the characters are suppose to interact with. This is an extremely unbalanced game.\n\n3) You like frustration and enjoying long and arduous "wild goose" missions that have very little reward. In the 17+ hours I spent Beta testing I was only able to complete 4 missions. My first mission "pick 5 lilacs" took over 2 hours to complete because there is absolutely no hints or help on where the missions objectives or resources were. The map is so scares in resources that it was pure luck that I stumbled upon the lilacs only after searching the entire map and dying 2 dozen times only to have to start over at "point A" each time. After searching 3 map zones and spending over 5 hours I still have yet to find the "Rhydanian trees" for my 4th mission.\n\n#gameFAIL","January 15, 2015","false","17.5"," 3 of 23 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","3","23","0","4"

There is zero reason why i should spend the same amount of hours crafting the shitiest item in this game compared to other games where the best items take less time to craft.\n\nIn the future this games economy will be ruined by botters due to its lack of a skill cap as well as the impossible amount of manhours need to craft.\n\nOther than that the game would be great, but as it stands without any incentive for players to actually progress in content, such as equipment upgrades or weapon upgrades, none of which that are better than what you start with can be purchased. The games grind wall for crafting shouldnt hit you at the door it should build up at the least to hook players into the game.","March 10, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 21 people (5%) found this review helpful","5","1","21","0","1"

No game offered as much freedom, depth and complexity as that game in its heyday. This game is the true spiritual successor to that game but adds plenty of modern mechanics like the action mode. The game is still in alpha, but is much more playable than Day-Z and H1Z1. If you want a complex RPG with no hand-holding and an open sandbox, the Repopulation is for you.\n\n\n2/20/2016 update.\n\n\nAll of that was true until the devs suspended development becuase of financial issues with the Hero Engine. The game will now have to be rebuilt from the ground up with Unreal Engine 4. I won't ask you to save your money since you can't even buy the game right now.

I understand there were a lot of issues with Hero Engine but, really no one should have been left in the dark for so long.  I poured my heart and soul into this game and sometimes put up with more than I should have just because of blind faith.  There were nights where it took me 5 or 6 attempts to log in without crashing, then to travel and crash and restart that cycle of log in, crash, log in, crash, log in, crash, log in, load world, crash. Disapearing items, broken combat, broken crafting, and tormentingly complex systems for crafting all kinda wore me out and made me quit.  I only stayed around for my nation.\n\nAfter a while though as population on the servers died and became barren there was no more reason to stay around.  Everyone left due to engine issues, again I don't blame Repop for this.\n\nNow with the game practically dead they have announced that they're releasing a new game on the unreal engine... which seems pretty sweet!  It seems like it may actually be a winner... but, will it be free to those who bought Repopulation?  Or are we getting more hands in our wallets?  I feel bad for the people who put money into buying the higher level packages... I only bought three copies of this game.\n\nOnly time will tell but, currently Repop is dead to me.","April 24, 2015","false","947.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do not waste your money unless you know something about Fragmented no one else on earth knows (assuming that's even really coming out and it's not just an excuse to have Steam allow them to keep this up.
