"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolffstamps/recommended/390930/","Wolffstamps","Wilk [Curator]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolffstamps/","233 products in account","Disclaimer - I have been gifted a free key for this game for review purposes, however, my review will be kept as truthful as possible since I am meant to help developers and buyers/gamers.\n\nAIPD  review:\n\nOverview\nAIPD is a rogue-like shoot-em-up game in which you have to survive waves of ever more intimidating enemies to make the game a whole lot more difficult on yourself and select a challenge. These include things such as: enemy powers upgraded, forever decreasing multiplier, you lose the ability to fire your weapons under certain circumstances, etc. It’s a simple idea but executed very well. You feel in control of your ship, it makes you really feel you are to blame whenever you die, unlike in many other games. Graphically it’s quite impressive, basically, everything has its own effect or whatnot with a bloom effect.\n\nGameplay\nBasically, it’s what you’d expect from a rogue-like game. You play in a tight arena with ever increasing amounts and difficulties of enemies. Over time, you will get some crazy multipliers and unique weapons/ships, each one either adding or nerfing to the gameplay. Personally, I found some combos of weapon-ships to just be flat out over powered. Such as a quick nimble ship using a highly damaging weapon. I can quickly get out of trouble wether it’s by shooting my way out of there or flying away.\n\nPros and cons\n\nPros:\nBeautiful soundtrack\nAmazing on-screen effects\nProgressively challenging\nLots of ship-weapon combos\nCan help reflex/action times\nFun\n\nCons:\nNot really that many ships or weapons\nYou get to design your own scenario, but you will still need to pick all the challenges in the end.\nOne, simple, stock map\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

It's a game to shoot a bunch of bug-looking things with so much neon lighting. Note: I love neon light xD","January 29","true","0.4"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

After each stage you can choose one of two randomly chosen modifiers (there are a lot in total!) making it more challenging and you can even build your own difficulty with them in a free mode.\n\nIn contrast to other games like this, it never feels unfair. It is always just you not being fast or smart enough and every time you get hit or lose the game, you're very motivated to try again. No ragequit potential, absolutely recommended!","January 29","true","3.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Its a kind of "Rogue Like Space Shooter". You fight, you gain Points, Points unlock new awesome weapons and Upgrades. The core gameplay is very addictive and challenging. There are a lot of additional game modes (millions of them???), which makes the game very replayable. AIPD is very well done and polished. The graphics are just awesome. I like the stylish blue and red ‘Tron-like’ graphics and its fast paced, reaction based gamestyle. Also...I LOVE the music!\nBottomline: AIPD is realistic twin stick successor to the long serving Geometry Wars.","January 29","true","1.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/recommended/390930/","pxabstraction","Parallax Abstraction","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/","985 products in account","I also covered this game on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlg6Q5EvjOU\n\nAIPD is an arena based shmup that's tailored to provide a specific kind of score attack experience. There are only 15 waves, a few types of enemies, one boss, one life and a big health bar. Your goal is to get to the end with as high a score as possible, that's it. In terms of raw content, some might find this lacking and I can't blame you if that's so. However, if you are a fan of score attack and particularly, one you can customise the challenge of, there's a lot to like here.\n\nYou have a variety of weapons and secondary abilities at your disposal. Most are locked off initially but you can unlock them all in less than an hour of play. You can use combinations of these, along with various powerups and superweapons you will acquire in the stages themselves, to take out enemies as fast as possible. Defeated foes will drop tiny shards that will increase your multiplier and you want to get as many of these as possible. Taking damage will lower your multiplier but not reset it entirely. After each stage, you're presented with two challenges that you must pick one of before proceeding and which stack as you get further in the game. These challenges will either give you a handicap or your enemies an advantage but they also come with an instant multiplier boost that is higher for more difficult challenges, encouraging greediness. You only have one life and can't regain health but your starting health is very generous. Once you either die or defeat the boss, your score is added to the leaderboards.\n\nUp to 4 players can play together locally and in addition to that, there are other modes available with different sets of challenges activated from the get go, plus three custom profiles where you can pick your own sets of challenges and thus, starting multiplier bonus. There's a lot of ways to customise your experience and challenge which is really refreshing to see and I wish more games like this did.\n\nThe one major bummer about AIPD is the leaderboard implementation. There is only one leaderboard for each game mode (including the custom design mode) and every difficulty level adds to the same leaderboard, meaning that if you're playing on a lower difficulty or playing the custom mode with less challenges enabled, you have an unlevel playing field with higher level players. There are two schools of thought on this. Some like it because it encourages people to get better and play higher levels but personally, I like each difficulty to have its own leaderboard so those that don't have as much time or just aren't as skilled can still feel like they're competing for a top slot. Personally, I'd like to see each difficulty get its own leaderboard, as well as each combination for the custom modes. A minor gripe at worst though.\n\nAIPD looks great (even on low-end hardware), plays great and really gets what makes a good score attack experience. This isn't going to be for everyone but if it's the kind of shmup you dig, the price is well worth it.","January 30","true","2.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Visually it looks great, the controls and tight, and the weapon options on the ships come in a pretty good variety. That said there's not much passed the basic gameplay cycle, so what you see after the first few levels is what you get for the game. Luckily there's a few modes of play to spice things up.","January 29","true","1.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The gameplay is straight forward enough for players to into the game quick while having a fair amount of customizing options to make each game session different.  The weapons and mods you unlock have different strengths/weaknesses, allow players to try out different methods on how to play throught the various levels.  Each time you beat a level, you must choose a challenge which will carry over to the other rounds, which makes for some chaotic fun for you and your friends.  However, if you play the game by yourself, the game will get boring pretty quick, especially since you can unlock everything within 2-3 hours.  But if you got friends that want simple fun with easy to learn gameplay, AIPD is worth giving a shot.\n\nRating: B","January 29","true","2.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

There are actually a lot of things to discover: What does each power-up do? What weapons and ship mods work well together? How do you adapt to the various challenges you have to choose between the waves?\n\nI also bought it on PS4 where it also runs amazingly smooth.","January 29","true","0.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Unlocks took a bit too long to unlock.  I was already bored of my existing weapons by the time I got the new ones.  The game lacks any real ability to bring yourself back from poor performance so it misses out on the rush of a comeback that games like Crawl do so well.  Surviving a level was always overshadowed by "well now my health is low for the next level."  The sheer amount of enemies can be a little overwhelming so I always ended up missing the enemies that really mattered until it was too late, which would be forgiveable if all punishments didn't hurt your entire run.  I also may have been missing enemies because the camera is not centered on the player,  but enemies can still come from the short side of the screen which gives them an arbitrary advantage.  Ultimately it just ended up feeling like a slow crawl towards inevitable death and that crawl didn't feel particularly engaging.","January 30","false","0.7"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","5","15","0","0"
