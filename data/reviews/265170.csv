A patch has come out that has fixed some of the issues, I can safely recommend the game now. Some issues still exist, but the game is actually functional. There has also been no official word on what the patch has contained showing rather poor communication skills.\n\nAcceleration of SUGURI mixes a 1v1 fighting genre with a SHMUP/Bullet-Hell type of gameplay, leaning more towards the latter than the former with an emphasis on being aggressive against your opponent and really good music.\nIf to put it even shorter : It's a good game.\n\nWhat isn't good is the quality of Steam integration and the lack of communication done by the publishers.\nThere are too many issues (some fixed, some still existing) with this release some of which will likely persist outside the Steam release : Multiple ways of causing this game to crash, unexplainable performance issues, missing sprites, rare cases of it being unable to load sprites altogether, unobtainable achievements, unclear achievement descriptions.\n\nBeyond that, the developers seemingly have disappeared and the only time someone has popped up, is to announce Steam Trading Cards being available for this game, on which the Emoticons are completely horrible and had all 10 seconds of effort put into them. Just look at the :devious: :its_on: (SUGURI) :cheer: :challenge: (AoSX) emoticons on the market.\n\nBut forget the Steam Trading Cards, these are a minor issue :\nOne of the finest examples of missing sprites is 2nd Player Suguri's weapon shooting sprite.\nThe game's performance drops when you enter the leaderboards (which are in-game rather than via the website for some reason)\nBroken unlockable conditions\nPlaying the game for long enough causes various interface objects not to load. (Including healthbars and even main menu)\nThere is no steam overlay support.\nSomeone I know has the game crash upon startup. The game also crashes if you alt-tab prior to Rockin Android screen.\nThe steam release while at launch was a tragedy, with many issues still persisting, is now actually playable both in netplay and singleplayer without painful workarounds.\n\n\nAddendum, August 8th, 2015 : If any of you suffer from any issues preventing you from playing the game, do not wait or try to get it fixed and just ask for a refund via steam support.","August 18, 2014","true","27.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinobooty/recommended/265170/","shinobooty","King of Heroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinobooty/","385 products in account","I haven't really played, well, any other bullet hell games besides Drunken Robot Pornography, so I can't exactly compare this to anything, but that is a good thing in my opinion, because it allows me to judge the game solely on its own merits, and not give it pre-set standards to live up to.\n\nNow, where do I even start. Think of this as a fighting game, except bullet hell. It's like Dragonball Z up in this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. There's a good selection of characters, each with their own unique move set (well, mostly), and they're all pretty much on equal footing. This is one of those games where it's best to pick one character and master them though, because if you can combo their moves together efficiently you will become an unstoppable force. Basically, if you think the idea of epic super powered fights between anime girls sounds cool, I'd recommend this game to you, especially because of the low price for this gem as well. My one complaint would be the fact that it pretty much assumes direct control of your desktop. You can't alt+tab unless you press esc first, and the steam overlay doesn't work. Basically it's a bit more complicated to manage other programs while you're playing this one. Also, I guess it can get pretty repetitive after a while if you don't have friends to play with, but it's managed to entertain me for 50+ hours, so it's not a huge problem.\n\nNow, I do want to point out his review is based on my experience. Apparently some people are having problems running the game, it's unresponsive to their controls, or they can't get achievements. Now, I honestly haven't encountered any of these problems personally. I play with a keyboard as well, and use Windows 8, yet it runs perfectly. Even multiplayer works fine for me and my friend. So, maybe it's a problem on their end? The point is, there is a chance the game may not work for you I guess, so buy with caution.","November 13, 2014","true","56.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimordialFruitJuice/recommended/265170/","PrimordialFruitJuice","üçäPureJuicefulüçä","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimordialFruitJuice/","63 products in account","Carrying some of the principles and mechanics of the game Suguri (i.e dashing priniciples and heat gauge), Acceleration of Suguri X-Edition HD takes into to a world of arcade fighting style where you can not only just play your favorite silver head female Suguri but you can now play an extra cast of eleven more characters each with their own attacks, method of attacks, hypers, and devastating combos. Not only are you are presented with new characters, you are presented with now reworked background stages, outstanding bgm, and vigorous fighting styles which now you can take to friends since you can versus each other online.\n\nAlright, so more on to the aspects of the game itself: The game, unlike Suguri, doesn't have that vast arsenal of weapons. Those weapons are now replaced by combos and abilities so don't expect to be unlocking weapons.... Not gonna happen. Another thing to mention is that the game only presents you with two storylines of which you have to play a certain character and battle you way to the end. In addition, this game may get repetitive since it only offers you only arcade style of playing these storylines against the same characters.\n\nWhat are the in-game differences?\n\n-There is actually only character that can actually recieve the title as a boss.\n\n-Sicne there are no bosses, the difficulty settings are now reduced to just easy, normal, and hard. There is no special. T^T\n\n-You actually have this option of where you can activate a shield when not using a hyper. This shield requires to 1 hyper gauge. (Pretty nice when it comes to outrageous situations)\n\n-Each character has more than 1 hyper that can be accomplished by combos associated with the hyper button. You can even execute the character's ultimate hyper by having 3 hyper guages and slamming the hyper button+dash button+attack button.\n\n-Like I mentioned before, it can get repetitive, howeverm if you like arcade style gaming and like the amazing combos you can do with these characters then it probably won't get that repetitive.\n\n-Some of these characters contain abilites of which you can spam.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Of course, I do. Now this is just coming from a huge Suguri fan. :v I recommend playing it to see if you like it, or just watch gameplays of it to see if meets your standards.\n\nP.S.\nStill has that achievement glitch....\n\nIf you have any questions about this game that I haven't discussed or left out, please tell me in the comments of this review and maybe I can asnwer them for you.","June 11, 2015","true","129.8"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","17","21","4","3"

AoS2 plays better, but that one doesn't have an English release. Honestly AoS is a pretty fun game marred mainly by the rocky initial steam release and terrible response from the company. RA at least got the horrible initial bugs fixed quickly, but I'm wondering why it's so problematic when the desura release was so smooth. 1 thing they did do however, is fix up the netcode. It runs alot smoother now and has less visible lag. Also you don't have to go through the godawful direct connect system anymore and can just run off steam lobbies. Which have issues granted, but it's still less trouble than the old method. Multiplayer is still fun as hell though.","July 3, 2014","true","19.1"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","1"

The game takes place during the time of Christmas where Miracles can occur.  During a party to celebrate the occasion a miracle occurs and a man appears who dreams of owning a harem and resting his head on the knees of other girls.  These acts of war will not go untreated as the man who is actually a robot clone can control some of the other girls who are robots as well and not actually battle gods.  Its time to alpha up, all will die who wish to rest their heads on the knees of girls!  No quarter shall be spared in this one on one fighting game street fighter style!  The controls are broken for most where you cant go diagonal, which is fine in single player but going online in multiplayer is a death sentence.  Its got fun fighting mechanics where you fight in the air, using attacks like from a side scroller shooter just like the first Suguri game.  Building up heats increases damage you do, so get alot of that heat! The more heat the better lest some man try to rest his head on your knees!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grimthunder62/recommended/265170/","grimthunder62","GrimThunder62","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grimthunder62/","151 products in account","Quick SummaryA localized fighting game based around characters from the original bullet hell game, Suguri. As well as a few crossover characters from OJ's other games, such as QP (from QP Shooting) and Sora (from Sora).\n\nPurchase Verdict: Yes\n\nPoints of Interest-Even though I love this game, it is necessary for me to give you the following warning. This is very buggy for many people, some people can't start it, some people have thirty minute load times, some people have random crashes. On top of these issues, there is no steam overlay and the multiplayer gamemode runs using an old method of allowing players to connect to eachother, often causing desyncs and crashes. Two of the achievements are also broken.\n\n-Charming, short story arc surrounding the story modes.\n\n-Mechanics are extremely similar to Suguri and Sora's gameplay, with many new additions to enhance the fighting experience.\n\n-Online community is practically non-existant, so find some friends or strangers and plan times to play.\n\n-Leaderboards are a huge part of this game, meaning a lot of people practice to become great players.\n\n-HD interface included, meaning you get new HD-styled sprites, backgrounds, and UI. However, those of you who are more nostalgic can still play with the non-HD interface without issue.","January 9, 2015","true","17.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Very fast paced and movement based, with a variety of characters that encourage different playstyles. The game mechanics are somewhat simple but the gameplay can become very deep, in both tactics and execution.\n\nThe main downside is that this is a fighting game with a very small community, so after playing trough the arcade mode and beating the AIs, you may have a hard time finding a human opponent to fight.\n\nStill, a unique and very fun experience, worth giving a try!","November 22, 2014","true","27.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FZeroRacer/recommended/265170/","FZeroRacer","Takeru Shirogane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FZeroRacer/","489 products in account","Edit: I can't really recommend this game anymore. Even though I'm a huge fan of AoS and how it plays, I'm heavily disappointed with Rockin' Android as a developer putting out such a buggy title and then vanishing off the face of the earth, like they seem to do with all of their titles. If you buy this know that you'll likely have a ton of issues and no fix posted any time soon. See below for my old review of the game itself.\n\nAcceleration of SUGURI is a fun and surprisingly competitive bullet hell/fighting game hybrid. Battles are extremely fast, with both players throwing multiple projectiles and bullets while weaving through them in attempt to catch them off-guard. Not just that though, you have to manage your HEAT bar which dicates your ability to dodge/dash and your hyper meter stock, which is used to perform hyper moves and furthers the fighting game similarities.\n\nThere's a good amount of variety in playstyle between the cast members, where you have your more zoning-oriented types like Kyoko or rushdown types like Kae each with a large amount of moves which can vary based on proximity or charge time.\n\nThe only problem with the game is that there isn't that much singleplayer content. There are a few arcade-esque story modes with entertaining characters if you've played Orange Juice's other games, but this game is purely versus-oriented and it excels at that. So if you're looking for something that's unique and are a fan of fighting games, SHMUPs or both then I definitely recommend this title.","July 1, 2014","false","0.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

There isn't too many characters, but the characters' movesets are greatly varied, complex, and exciting.\n\nThe system puts you in a circular arena and you fly around and shoot/smack/bomb/entrap your opponent in a way similar to Seventh Sky, an old Flash mech game that floated around the net for a bit and never saw an update.\n\nWhat absolutely kills this is the emotes you get are terribad, and the Steam Overlay is nonfunctioning a la Dungeons of Dredmor (Dredmor can be fixed by adding -opengl to the launch options, by the way. No responses so far here.) The official addressing of a few problems seems to be rather absent.

It does that quite well, with a little eye candy to boot (though it lacks for a tutorial, and you'll have to look up an explanation of the somewhat complicated gameplay online).  I'm told there's a small but dedicated fanbase, so hopefully you'll find competition, and even if you don't, the game features AI with varying difficulty levels.  If, however, you're looking for something with more substance (as  I generally am), I'd pass on it.  There is a story mode (more than one, actually), but this is easily the worst writing I can recall seeing in a videogame.  I think it's supposed to be funny, but... this isn't even one of those cases where it's so bad it's funny.  It's just bloody awful.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/265170/","taylort210","Wagglesworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/","3054 products in account","In a somewhat odd move, developer Orange Juice's sequel to its bullet hell shooter Suguri all but ignores standard sequel protocol in Acceleration of Suguri, a bullet hell shooter/fighter hybrid. Adapting the end level boss mechanic from Suguri, wherein the player faces off against one of a number of flying, hyper-weapon toting anime girls, AoS offers a ridiculously fast paced aerial combat title for two players filled with more multi-color pellets, techno music and short skirts than an otaku convention!\n\nEach fighter comes equipped with two unique weapons, each usually containing two abilities of their own, along with a super attack, shield and the ability to dash around the sky-high arena at a breakneck pace whilst dodging all manner of weaponry. Weaponry is very distinguishable, there are majorly no similarities between loadouts and abilities, and successful play styles vary between each character. Stow any fears that lack of buttons and combos make for a dull combative affair, AoS requires just as much forethought and cunning as it does quick reflexes if you want to best your opponents. That said, it‚Äôs entirely possible to get by on reflexes and button mashing alone, but better players will have no problem putting you in your place.\n\nThe arenas themselves, aside from differentiating backgrounds, are indistinguishable from one another. Their only purpose is to provide a backdrop to the girl-on-girl action. A similar lack of variety comes in the single player experience. Aside from a standard arcade mode and two separate side stories, each with their own individual tourney, the experience is limited by your want to better your scores and skills by taking on higher difficulties in arcade. Luckily, AoS features local and online multiplayer, from what I‚Äôve sampled, the online works surprisingly well, aside from the occasional disconnect. It‚Äôs even easier to battle friends with an option to only search for friends‚Äô lobbies. Since there‚Äôs no group tourney mode, nor any lobby option larger than two, it‚Äôs a much appreciated feature.\n\nThe HD artwork is crisp and colorful, and the accompanying techno soundtrack is supremely catchy and fits well with the hectic nature of the gunplay. Really, I can‚Äôt stress how fantastic the menu theme is, I‚Äôve found myself leaving the game on the menu screen and enjoying the looping beat while I take care of other business. It‚Äôs very catchy. It‚Äôs a shame that there isn‚Äôt more music to the title. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve heard even a full handful of unique tunes in my several hours play time.\n\nAside from a lack of solid single player options and only slightly fewer fighters than I‚Äôd have liked, AoS offers a unique experience that a very niche audience is going to adore. The sheer pace of it all will undoubtedly alienate some, but for any shmup buffs (I‚Äôm admittedly awful at most), fighting fans (depends on the style), or anyone just looking for something new to smack their friend around in to a techno beat (there we go), then look no further. It may be limited in its single player offering, but as long as you have a willing bud to play with, you‚Äôll be hard pressed to find a similarly unique and hectic experience to waste away an afternoon in.","July 1, 2014","true","5.9"," 16 of 38 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","16","38","0","3"

Game is amazing. Fast, Frantic, Hectic.  I describe it to friends as a "High-Movement, Versus Shoot 'Em Up". and it's pretty accurate.  You control a character and fire weapons and laser swords and giant fists at your opponent to reduce their hp to zero at an alarming rate. The game is simple on the surface and allows very deep and quick-reaction strategy. When you become more skilled you both see and feel its rewards.\n\nThere are tiers of "this character is definitely better than this character", but there are no flowcharts. It's a matchup-intensive game but it is driven by KNOWLEDGE, and by ADAPTATION. Any character can win. You have be very cognizant of situations and understand when to push, when to back off, when to set up. There's a lot that goes on constantly. You have to watch the camera, you have to watch what's /not/ on the camera, everything is nuts because it all happens so fast.\n\nThe first fifty or so rounds that you seriously play in this game will be a blur of "I have no idea what's going on and I have no idea what i'm doing." This is -normal- and you'll acclimate quickly from there. It's just like watching or playing anything for the first time.\n\nThere are cons, but to me they don't mean anything compared to the pros.\n- Some people don't like the camera functionality. (I think it adds a layer of strategy and meta\n- Despite what I said above, some characters really do struggle in every match.\n- Please never pick QP unless you're being a nutbar. She's too good and is banned in competitive circles.\n\nI love Acceleration of Suguri X Edition. I want you to love it, too.

This is a japanese anime-style fighting game, A.K.A. don't expect plot (At least not one that makes sense).  If your looking for something comical or "Kawaii" all the while being action 1 Vs 1 battles, this is probably a good game for you.  A gamepad is recommended, but a keyboard should work just fine (Does for me at least).  For a little over $5.00, I'd say you're getting what you paid for.  As with all things, it really comes down to personal preference.  I, myself, give it a 7/10 for simply giving me what I expected and paid for.  There's no real "gold" here, but if it's on sale, I do recommend going for it.","December 14, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the ones who whished to play against their friends.\nThere are some kind of modes to play against someone and the weapons cannot be chosen, but the character you want to play.\nThe graphics are better (HD). The control setting is almost the same as in "Suguri". Now you have some shield too and a second hyper/special attack. Read for the most of the information my other review of "Suguri".\nIt's a nice feature but nothing more. The game is alone played through (on easy) in, let me see, I needed about 10 minutes, because you are only fighting against the endbosses of the game "Suguri" itself.","December 24, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well you're in luck!\n\nFeatures an arcade mode and two seperate story-modes all with unlockable characters from completeing!\nHas online play to play with anyone or a friend!\n\nThe game has a lot more strategy when you start to understand it more and more, for instance, you can use the dash functions to go through energy projectiles but you can't dash through solid projectiles such as missles or robot fists, but you can kill solid projectiles with your own energy projectiles.\n\nOnce you learn more and more, the better you'll become and the more fun you'll have.
