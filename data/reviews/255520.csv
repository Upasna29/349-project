Ther're not letting me leave. Not until I clean every bit of this temple. I have to finish what I started.\nDAY 32: -- Wow, its been a long time, I'm getting very hungry, my supply is starting to run out. But i found a bullet shell in the corner on the room.

After playing Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior you’ll learn that maybe you should reconsider before you go out of your way to break everything in a room.\n\nStory:\nLo Wang got in a devastating battle at a temple nearby destroying everything in sight. You are hired as a janitor to clean up a terrible mess. Bodies are everywhere, art is destroyed, and you’re the only man for the job.\n\nCampaign:\nThere is one level; it’s the same as the first level in the new Shadow Warrior game. It’s your job to clean it up with a mop and your hands. You must deposit the debris into various incinerators, mop up blood, and grab all the cash you can find. The campaign only has two achievements, clean up everything and grab all the money. If you can do this you’ve proven that “you’re the best around and nothing’s ever gonna to keep you down.”\n\nGameplay:\nThis game plays similar to an FPS. The camera is always in first person and your two weapons are a mop and your hands. You must pick up garbage with your hands and throw it into incinerators while mopping up gallons of blood. You better keep your mop clean, but beware for some odd reason the machines that provide water can shoot out an organ. Similar to a normal janitor after you are done you must clock out.\n\nResults:\nIf you have always wondered what happens after a game, wonder what life as a janitor for crime scenes would be like, or even just want to play a game that doesn’t push your wits then Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is for you. This brilliant game is hilarious to play if you just beat the first level of Shadow Warrior. For some odd reason the character sounds exactly like Lo Wang, which makes me wonder if after he saved the universe he decided to give up fighting and clean up his messes.\n\nPros:\n+You get to experience Shadow Warrior through a whole new light.\n+You get to clean up bodies, mop up blood, and steal money… how many games offer that?\n+Good graphics\n+Easy gameplay, with simple controls.\n+Funny dialogue\n+Two straightforward achievements\n+Its free if you already own Shadow Warrior (2013)\n+YOU GET TO BE A JANITOR\n\nCons:\n-Cleaning up everything achievement can be really annoying as a single bullet shell could be the culprit.\n-There is only one level (why can’t we clean more)","June 30, 2014","true","2.6"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","38","41","0","0"

There is only one level, which is the first level of Shadow Warrior remake, and it only consists of like 2 areas to clean. Mainly – only the floor is messed up in this one, so it really doesn’t offer much. No explosives to play around with. In Santa’s rampage you could find letters directed to Santa which possibly explain his outrage. Again, this demo is missing most of that and for the most part feels hollow. The only real feature is that they copied the character of Wang from the game, but alas, the amount of lines he says is really limited.\n\nUnlike "Santa's Rampage" version, this game is missing that sense of completion feeling. If you were to put the clean and bloody versions of that level, you would see that they barely differ compared to Santa’s Rampage. I suppose it is something to do with the lighting.\n\nIn the end, the game feels very hollow. That said, the game comes free for all Shadow Warrior owners. I suppose the game can be counted as a little bonus.","December 24, 2013","true","4.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Not only bodies but bullet casings, pieces of glass and other trash await to be picked up.\n\nThere is an incinerator where you need to take everything. Buckets are available full of water so that you can clean your mop and you can get cases where you can collect all the stuff so that you can dispose of them at the incinerator at once.\n\nThere is a radio in the 1st hall where the music of SW is being played and the janitor guy tries to act like Lo Wang by saying one-liners regularly. Also, you can collect money rolls and there is a special case where you can collect all these.\n\nThis is a no brainer but a good pastime. The original Viscera Cleanup Detail (available separately via Steam Store) has nothing to do with SW but has its own theme. I might just pick it up after finishing this one!","December 6, 2014","true","4.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

You have your trustworthy mop (press 1) your hands, trained on numerous temples you cleaned before (press 2) and "The Sniffer" (press 3) which can detect blood and clutter around you (left click to turn on/off, right click to change mode)\nThe game mechanically both simple and great. You need to clean the place up - get shurikens, katanas, guns and smashed statues to the incinerator, as well as mop up the blood and clean up the severed torsos, limbs, internal organs (Hey, they had a wild party previously!) The little trick is in the later items - bumping into objects, kicking body parts will splatter blood around, and if you step into a blood puddle, you'll leave nice bloodie footprints for a while.\nYou don't need to take every single item to the incinerator - there are yellow crates in which you can dump items, then bring them in one turn. Basically this is the most intresting part of the game.  It's because the game is kinda more physics-simulator than a real game. You can actually throw/put items into the crates, and you can shake them out of it. Tip it over. Collide with a wall and drop it.\nThe game's physics great, and actually somehow the theme also fares really well.  I was mainly playing this when I was too sleepy to play with anything that requires thinking, and actually this was quite a good game for that purpose - I finished it in about 3 hours.\nSadly I can't tell anything from the multiplayer options, I haven't tried it out yet.\nI don't know if there is any point of writing this review as currently the game isn't sold separately but at this point I think I summed the game up quite nicely, maybe some of you will find it useful eventually :)\nI liked the game, it's really like a good old household chores - while you do the cleaning and menial work, you don't really need to pay attention,  you can think about everything you want. It was a great experience from a free gift game.","December 10, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

A very linear game, until you figure out you're allowed to start playing with EVERYTHING the Yakuza dropped; swords, wads of money, guns, and, most importantly, limbs.

OOOHH YOU WANNA CLEANUP SOME WANG?\n\nThis game does something I thought nothing could ever do... It made cleaning your mess up fun.\nSo as an employee of Zilla Corp. You are assigned to clean up the temple that was trashed in the beginning of Shadow Warrior, all the bodies, blood, and damn broken glass.\nYou use your mop to clean up blood, the incinerator to burn the little bits, and the hazmat bins for the bigger stuff. Find some bloody money? Put it in the suitcase for an extra reward when you clock out... and maybe put a few priceless artifacts in there too. And why not use that dinky little device you received to make sure you didn’t miss anything? And remember, clean with honor.\n\nWow, was it difficult to decide if I recommend this or not. It’s a cleaning game, so there’s defiantly going to be mixed opinions, for example a friend and I LOVE these Cleanup Detail games, while two of my other friends hate them, and I recommend on if I like a game or not, not if it's good or bad. So there were two ways I could review this, as a good game or as a bad game. I decided I’ll do it as a good game, because I sure as hell liked it.\nThis, for being a cleaning game, is amazing. Somehow it makes cleaning addicting, I spent an hour just burning stuff and another cleaning up the blood... and I was okay with that!\nThe visuals, as with Shadow Warrior’s, aren’t too great, but defiantly get the job done. Dialog is amazing with Wang’s witty comments as you burn stuff and find money.\n\nBut this game is riddled with bugs and glitches. Sometimes when picking up an object, it sporadically flies through the air, or when you move the suitcase all the money gets throw across the room, and the worst, disappearing objects. After three hours of cleaning and burning, I had found all the money and was getting ready to clock out, but I bumped the suitcase, causing it to glitch out and send one of the rolls of bills flying. Luckily, I watched where it landed. Unluckily, I also watched it fall out of the map through the floor.\n\nOCD people will love/hate this game, and so will anybody with addictive natures. But I doubt any 'hardcore' Call of Duty players will enjoy this for more than ten minutes.\n\nPros:\nLo Wang's witty comments\nrevolutionizes cleaning\naddictive gameplay\ninteresting and original mechanics (using incinerator, buckets spilling, Etc.)\n\nCons:\nit’s a cleaning game...

Then this might be the janitorial simulator for you.\n\nWhat can I say about this title? For a start it’s free. So yep I have no doubts that it’s a real bargain. Not only is as cheap as it’s possible to be without paying you to play it, it’s also a heck of fun as well. I spent over an hour cleaning up the carnage left by some previous assassin who thought it would be fun to paint the walls, floor and ceiling red. It is a lot better than it sounds.\n\nListening to all the janitors little comments made me chuckle every time. The environment is pretty, but then again it is supposed to be an oriental shrine…. Or temple…. Or castle…. I think it’s just a rich guy’s palace actually.\n\nIf you do get hold of Shadow Warrior and end up with this free dlc you should really play this to completion, those last few blood stains hidden on the carpet may drive you mad but the feeling of accomplishment for finishing is worth it. It also helps that the soundtrack (singular song) I found catchy.\n\nHave fun ^_^","May 13, 2014","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As someone prone to rage-quitting (or really, prone to rage in general), this game forced me to slow down, take deep breaths, and not freak out. Because if you do, the mop bucket flips over and suddenly you have bloody water everywhere. The game is rather immersive, and by that I mean the bright red/gold/yellow color palette will mess with your eyes until you're combing the screen for every speck of blood, gore, and glass. At this point, you might as well start whistling a tune like the in-game janitor occasionally does....because you and he essentially become the same person.\n\nThe store page doesn't quite mention this, but the most difficult bits to find and pick up are definitely the bullet casings and broken glass. Additionally, the physics are sometimes a bit glitchy, which at one point caused my box of collected money stacks to go flying up toward the ceiling until the game was literally "makin' it rain". Of course, the gameplay had by then forcibly calmed my inner rage monkey and so I calmly went about recollecting all of the money. If only I could clean my house in the same o.c.d. manner....but for now, the video game version is enough.

I started with Santa's Rampage, then moved on to this one (will be doing the actual Viscera game soon). I have already reviewed Santa's Rampage, and these two games are very similar. The link to SR has been provided above.\n\nIf you like the Shadow Warrior theme, cleaning, and relaxing, casual gameplay, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nSince I have already provided the link to SR, I will be commenting on the differences between the two games (SR and Shadow Warrior).\n\nThe aesthetics in Shadow Warrior are very, very good. The building you are in is nicely detailed with different museum pieces, and the variety of things to clean up is good. Like SR, there is a radio you can pick up and carry around if you want some music while you play. The music is very good and matches the theme appropriately - the menu screen music is also really nice. I have noticed that your character actually speaks and makes comments during gameplay - usually when you pick up stuff. The level is also fairly larger than SR, but a lot more symmetrical.\n\nThus far, I have found no way to kill yourself, so I do not think this is possible in SW. There are only two achievements - completely cleaning the building and amassing 2 million dollars in your trunk. I was unable to find the last bit of mess to cleanup - I scoured the ENTIRE building with my sniffer and just could not find any blood splatters =(. I also ended with 1,875,000 dollars (so close!). I am unsure whether or not the museum pieces are worth money (I had thrown all of them into the furnace), so that might contribute to the final count when you punch out.\n\nThe game is still fairly buggy at times - in particular with the ridiculous collision mechanics. Sometimes pieces can just randomly go flying, and I've also noticed that some of the doors will swing around violently. As in SR, the collision mechanics between objects are EXTREMELY sensitive, so consider walking (hold CTRL) whenever you are carrying water buckets and the hazardous waste containers.\n\nOverall, this game is very fun, and you should check it out if you are interested in this concept.\n\nDefinitely recommend!\n\nIf you like this review, please consider checking out DJSF's Rogue Reviews Steam Group for more in-depth reviews","August 10, 2014","true","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

In Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior, it is your job to clean up the spilled blood as well as to incinerate the left-over body parts, weapons, and debris, from a previous battle whilst searching for wads of cash amongst the carnage. This game is good for a quick laugh if you can tolerate the game's gore-saturated humor, and the two achievements the game offers are very challenging. As the game exists primarily as a joke, it is quite shallow; there is only one level to play, and there is little replay value.

This isn't for you.\n\nIf you like screwing around in a serious game trying to do stuff you really shouldn't do in the real game... this will probably entertain you for some time.\n\nIf you're OCD, project-oriented, or process-optimization-oriented, then this can turn into crack-cocaine for you.\n\nLike all VCD's, you'll either love it or hate it. It sparks a certain user-base while really annoying another. Really not much middle ground.\n\nLast time I played Shadow Warrior was in the 90's when it came out after Duke Nukem 3D. I haven't played the updated version. I'm just getting old and bored with "serious" games. But, VCD has caught my interest, and the Shadow Warrior VCD was pretty entertaining.\n\nI think my only beef with it is there's no "Office" after-party to show how you did like in the main VCD game. You go to clock out, and it berates you saying there's still cleaning to do. You look all over the place, but it looks clean. You use the sniffer... don't get anything. So, you "clock out in shame" just to get back to the start screen. No telling how well you did.\n\nI don't mind a stand-alone game, but I think this should have been tacked onto VCD as a level instead of as a stand-alone game. Modify "The Office" to include trophy showcases for Shadow Warrior stuff. (But, that's an issue with VCD as a whole... The Office is a pretty lackluster trophy showroom.)\n\nOverall, had fun. Worth it if you love VCD. Lo Wang's comments were funny at times. However, they really didn't do much to flex the potential of VCD. It was just cleaning as usual. There were no puzzles or secret areas or such to find. Just typical VCD things.","October 29, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Not only is this a very fun time waster, but it's also a relaxing experience and an overall good demonstration of the main game.\n\nThis game was included in the Special Edition of Shadow Warrior.  It wasn't a game I bought by itself, but I'm glad I was able to obtain it in some way.  The graphics are beautiful, the ambiance is soothing and it controls like it's supposed to.\n\nThe only problem I had was that it was sometimes a little too hard to see the blood.  I'd imagine that in the main game, you would be working with surfaces that are mostly made up of dark colors (black, grey, etc.), but here, you're working with surfaces that are very abundant in bright reds.\n\nI would go so far as to say that this is a good gateway to buying Viscera Cleanup Detail.  For the price I paid for Shadow Warrior: Special Edition ($3.99), this bonus minigame was definitely worth it.  If you're a stickler for absolute cleanliness or just have a few hours you want to kill, then this is worth a play.","January 7","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You'll see the same "Xtreme" mopping, bucket kicking and carcass throwing as before, but you won't be fixing or reattaching things per say. As a free game though, this is more than what I would have asked for.\n\nThere is only a single stage in this whole thing and it takes about an hour or two to complete, three if you're completely new to the setting. I will recommend people to go through Shadow Warrior first before attempting this, so as to enjoy the map more.","January 28","true","9.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/recommended/255520/","scrubsauce","Scrubsauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/","394 products in account","I booted this one up right after beating the Shadow Warrior campaign for the first time.  I'm familiar with the full Viscera Cleanup Detail and the Santa's Workshop stand-alone, but had yet to play either of those, so I was going into this experience with fresh eyes.  Boy, what an experience it turned out to be.  I had seen the trailers, the screenshots, but actually walking into Zilla's dojo to pick up the mess left by Lo Wang was somehow, as boring as the idea of janitorial labor may sound, so cathartic and entertaining.\n\nI'm not sure if the assets were reused ad-naseum from Shadow Warrior, but this stand alone still looks as gorgeous as the base game.  The new parts added in specifically for VCD have just a vaguely more cartoonish style to them than the rest of the game, but it isn't jarring, and just makes things easier to play as you can easily, visually, distinguish what is part of the map, and what is a tool to help you clean it.\n\nIn my playthrough, I spent HOURS scrubbing the hell out of the floor, the walls, and burning any body part, organ, or piece of shrapnel that didn't belong.  The tasks were reptitive, but not in annoying way, it felt a lot more like playing something that keeps you coming back despite staying the same mechanically, like Tetris, than it did actually doing a chore like mowing the lawn or shoveling the sidewalk.\n\nDespite all of this, the punchout machine still gave me flak for not completing the job properly, for someone with severe OCD this could probably be maddening, as I walked around the map for a good ten minutes looking for anything I had forgotten to clean up.  I guess even in the virtual space, perfection isn't easily obtained.\n\nThis nice little freebie (yes,it comes free with the base Shadow Warrior purchase) has me sold on the main Viscera Cleanup Detail game, and I'm looking forward to seeing how RuneStorm expands upon the concept for a full-blown title of their own design.","January 31","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And somehow, it works wonders. What you see here, Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is the Beta of a game that's out already. I got it when I bought Shadow Warrior as everybody else who has this and told myself at some point: The name sounds stupid enough, let's give it a try. And oh man, I was right.\n\nThe game goes arround on this concept: Have you ever though what happend after your character utterly DESTROYS everything on a level, leaving pools of blood, unloaded weapons and mags, and also piles and piles of limps arround it? This is what happens, a random, nameless dude who works for some weird company is send to clean it up before the next player arrives. Now, have you heard that right? You're here to clean. CLEAN. SOME PEOPLE REFUSE TO DO IT IN REAL LIFE, WHY IN THE MOTHER OF ♥♥♥♥ WOULD THEY DO IT ON A GAME!? Funny enough, I actually did. I cleaned everything. And I also stole all the money. Two hours of my life wasted, and I don't regret anything.\n\nYou see, this game is extremely relaxing. REALLY, REALLY RELAXING. The only thing that doesn't need though, are the dumb comments of your character: Luckily they got taken out on the final release of the game. It also has coop, so you can relax WITH FRIENDS! AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S EVEN BETTER THAN RELAXING WITH FRIENDS?! TALKING USING MICROSOFT SAM, HOLY MOTHER OF ANAL EVACUATIONS, NOW THAT'S CLASSY! So yeah, you can enable the old but classic Microsoft Sam voice to read every priceless piece of art that everyone speaks. Which is funnier than it might look like.\n\nDo I recommend the Shadow Warrior version? Well, you can't even buy it on it's own, really. It's a gift from one of the editions. Do I recommend the full game, though? YES. ♥♥♥♥ YES. But wait for a sale. As fun as it might look like, 10€ is TOO MUCH. If you buy it, make sure you have at least another poor excuse of a friend to play it with.","July 13, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I enjoyed some of the voice acting but it got tiresome fast, it is humorous but needs a lot more or you will get sick of hearing the same lines over and over.\n\nThe main reason I don't recommend this game is because I didn't get what I bought this game for, completing the two achievements.\n\nI clocked out with a trunk full of $2,000,000 (in 22 pieces) and a temple fully cleaned and was commended on the clock out screen for my efforts yet I didn't unlock either of the achievements.\n\nSecondly on the main menu they've got a host/join option presumably for multiplayer/coop janitorial duties that does not work at all. I've followed many guides and read developers comments on this and they say it works but it doesn't. I've tried the hosting a dedicated server method, I've opened all of the necessary ports but my friends are unable to join my server, nor am I able to join a friends server.\n\nIf it was just the latter problem I would still recommend this game as it doesn't say multiplayer/coop on the store page, but it certainly advertises achievements which I still don't have.","July 5, 2015","false","2.7"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","0"

If free.\n\nI love the idea, you are a "cleaner". There was a wild party/blood bath last night, you are in charge of removing the bodies and cleaning up the mess.\n\nThis could be an all-star game, however it takes some serious time to accomplish anything  in the game.\n\nAfter the initial movie, they drop you in a huge ♥♥♥ building with only a mop. I cleaned a few rooms (5%), but without any tasks or completion it quickly turned into a snooze fest.\n\nWorth nothing, came free with shadow warrior, Just a cool idea worth playing once.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

I never bought that game because I found it very stupid and knew I would not enjoy it. This one came for free with Shadow Warrior for some reason.\n\nThe premise of these "Cleanup" games is funny, but NOT fun. It is literally the most repetitive, boring, pointless "gameplay" of all time. Sure, that's the general idea or joke of these "games", is that you are willing to play something so silly and simulate doing a menial job from your computer.\n\nBut that's why I find it entirely stupid - and also don't understand why people are willing to spend their time doing something like this simulation. Go do something more interesting and useful with your time.\n\n(P.S. This "game" is one of very few that I am so easily enraged about.

At the end of the process it shows a message saying "Your installation could not be complete. Same or higher version of.NET framework has already been installed on this computer." and upon closing the message I get another saying :You are about to be logged off. Windows will shut down in 1 miinute." All the programs shut down and windows reboots withen 10 seconds of the message. Upon restart the message pops up again and restarts again, and again and again. The only way I have found to fix this was control+alt+delete, going to Services and ending the Unreal engine one in task manager. VERY irritating as I thought that I had some kind of incurable virus and ran checkdisk twice before figuring out the solution on my own wits. And I STILL cant play the game. whether its Unreal or Framework thats causing the issue this needs to be fixed.","November 19, 2013","true","0.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game has real life applicability, since the tasks are so simple and boring it pretty much prepares you for your upcoming cleaning career.\n+ Free game (included when purchasing Shadow Warrior).\n+ Game lasts 1-2 hours, so thankfully the pain of playing is short-lived.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Horrificly monotonous. This entire game consists of using your mop and bucket to clean blood from the temple floors and then you're expected to dispose of guns, shell casings, katanas, shurikens and severed body parts by placing them in the biohazard bins.\n- Experience the sheer frustration and tedium of a cleaner, as you'll regularly mop up your own bloody footprints and walk back and forth to refill mop buckets with water, or get new biohazard bins.\n\nOverall Score 1/10\n\nFor anyone aspiring to be a janitor, I really do recommend this incredibly repetitive, dull game. As for the rest of us, avoid. I got it for free with Shadow Warrior, so it didn't cost me a cent. But that still doesn't mean it's good, in fact it's downright bad.","December 22, 2014","false","5.0"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","41","9","22","6","2"

I had seen the Cleanup game thingy before so I figured I might as well give this a try.\n\nbut why\n\nWhy is there a game for cleaning?\n\nI play video games to do stuff that I can't do irl. Sure, I can't exactly clean up blood, machine guns, and big wads of cash, but that's because i don't surround myself in that sort of lifestyle, which i'm cool with. Instead of playing this game, why not just do something productive like.. actually cleaning your house?\n\nThe idea of a cleaning game is unique, I guess, and I'm not just bashing it because i think it's stupid. I genuinely don't find it fun. It's very meticulous and I couldn't even bring myself to complete it. When I started the game, I didn't really know what the hell i was doing. Maybe you're supposed to have prior knowledge to how the gadgets and things work (or maybe there's instructions but i couldn't be bothered to rly look for them) but  I didn't really know where I was supposed to put things or what would be considered correct. I managed to bring myself to clean up the first room, and then moved on to the next one. Then I started looking around the temple and realizing how big it was and how long it would take me to finish this. And it dawned on me. Whyyyyyyyy would i want to waste like 2 hours cleaning up a virtual mess????? It doesn't make sense to me.\n\nYou pick up things and place them in other things and then sometimes you tip it over and then you have to stand it up and put everything back in. how is that fun. do you people enjoy this kind of stuff? it's virtual torture.\n\ni would rather spend 2 hours trying to clean up my mess of  a life than this mess of a game.","May 29","false","0.5"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","10","1","10","0","0"

You are a janitor; and in this case you clean for the Zilla Corporation, making the temple that serves as the prologue for Flying Wild Hog's Shadow Warrior squeaky clean. For best results, play this after you finish the prologue; then you will either be in awe or upset at the mess you made.\n\nLike in the main VCD game, you're a janitor armed with only a mop, a 'sniffer', endless supplies of water buckets and biohazard crates, incinerators, and your own two hands to clean up the messes made by gore and gib happy protagonists like Lo Wang. The cleaning action that you find in the main game is found alive and well here. Even though most of the rooms are red, it is remarkably easy to locate blood and mop it up. Smaller items like tiny gibs and shell casings are kept to a minimum, sure to please longtime players of VCD who routinely come across piles of spent shells. Finally, in a move sure to make this an easy cleanup, you're given two incinerators and two mop bucket generators which will make the job go faster, not to mention that the game generously has spawned a number of buckets and biohazard crates waiting for fresh new janitors to utilize.\n\nSo while you are cursing Lo Wang for making your life hard, this level adds a few new things to entertain you while you clean. First off, your janitor has a voice who comments on the messes and whistles to himself. He adds some character to the game ("Dammit, they used an automatic!). He lapses into repeats after some time but they never wear out their welcome. A radio in the first hall blasts the soundtrack to Shadow Warrior. Finally, SPOILER FOR SHADOW WARRIOR: remember how in the prologue Lo Wang walks into the hall with two million dollars? A side goal to cleaning up the temple is to collect all of the cash you find and toss it into the janitor's private trunk. It adds some variety to the clean-all-the-things formula that VCD is known for.  END SPOILER\n\nThe game is still not without its glitches, and the sniffer for finding missed debris or gibs is still hit or miss, but it's nice to see that the improvements developer RuneStorm have made to the VCD experience has created a fun little companion game to Shadow Warrior. For VCD veterans, it's another level to test their ability to clean.","December 2, 2013","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The "game" has only two achievements. one of them is awarded for beating the game ( its impossible to get this one ), and the second is awarded for filling a box with all the in game money items. I like this small game mainly because it comes free, with a copy of shadow warrior.

The gameplay is INCREDIBLY tedious, there is only one place to throw away body parts in each room, which means going back and forth back and forth and back and forth. It gets annoying very fast.\n\nAnd after I was done, I walked into the next room and it was the same thing. Blood, body parts, cleaning tools. There was nothing diffrent, except that there was a staircase and a new small balcony upstairs.\nThere were no new concepts, materials, tools, it was the same tedious gameplay, except there was more.\n\nDo not let these "comedians" who say thing such as "mopping sim 2014 10/10" convince you to buy this game. Yes, it is a mopping sim. That's all it is. And it's not fun.\n\nOverall - 3/10\nDo not buy this game, it is a huge waste of your time and money.\n","May 22, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The idea is funny and this is nice to play if you're multitasking with something else or listening to a podcast.\n\nSomething that would make this game a lot better would be to have a score screen after you finish beyond the money count.  Percentage of blood cleaned up, x/y items incinerated, % money found.   Stuff like that.  As it is now, it is frustrating to clean all you can see and not get an indication of how close you got.\n\nThere is an item that acts like sonar for blood and items so you can listen to if you are close to something that needs cleaning but it's still searching for a needle in a haystack.  A visual guide would really help.  Even if it was just Aliens scanner style.\n\nI recommend cleaning just the first main room.  Cleaning the whole place isn't really satisfying because you'll still come up short.","February 27, 2015","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very simply put: While the idea of some poor bloke that has to clean up the mess Lo Wang made with his katana initially seems funny, this is not the case because the work itself is fun, but because we experience schadenfreude over not being said poor bloke.\n\nIf you decide to start the "game" anyway, you will soon realize that cleaning up a virtual mess is about as funny as cleaning up a real one, so unless you are suffering from a bad case of OCD and take a manical joy from scrubbing things until they are all shiny and clean, the only thing this game will accomplish is boring you to death.","February 7, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good for some but... Probably not for most. There is nothing wrong with it. (For the most part) In fact its actually really well made for Shareware\Shovelware. The graphics are identical to Shadow Warrior. (Which is to say pretty damn good)  It's simple but its not easy. About 5-6 mop strokes soils your mop. After which you must wash\wring out the mop at any water source. You must also pick up bodyparts (I'm assuming weapons as well) which bleed causing you to track bloody footprints and puddles.\n\nBasically washed the first 2\3 rooms. Tried to pick up bodyparts and drop them into waste bins. The camera angle and mechanic are kinda janky (Think of trying to shoot a basketball straight up...with your buttcheeks). Rimshot a head 3 times trying to make it land in the waste basket. Walked over to a bucket I had been using to wash my mop. Moved alittle closer and knocked it over............\n\nIt made me think "I've had a root canal in which the sedative wore off halfway through....... Two nurses had to hold my scrawny like 13 year old self down. Until they could give me some more. Anyway It'd be less painful to go through that again then to finish this game from start to finish."\n\nThat being said a whole lot of time and effort went into this and it shows.  But they went out on a limb and tried something new and for free Hey I cant hate on that!\n\nBottom line if you want a fast paced shooter along the lines of Serious Sam and have chronic OCD. This is your game!\nPersonally I like to make messes not clean them up.","December 28, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This and Santa's rampage that is. It is so strange just how much fun I had with these title (Still digging into the main game itself for now) just from tossing bodies into the furnace, mopping up the blood and then taking one last look at the now squeaky clean area that used to be soaked in blood and corpses.\n\nMy only real criticism is that the buckets and bins really don't like the stairs so if you don't lift them up high enough then prepare to go flinging through the air. That's about it though. Wonky bin physics aside, this was worth every bit of money I paid for it. I actually got this and Santa's rampae when I bought the main Viscera Cleanup Detail game so  money well spent\n\nI'd actually love to see more done with this kind of thing. There are several characters out there that leave quite a mess behind them like Kratos fron God of war, Frank, Chuck and whatshisfacefromthebadone from the Dead rising games, Any of the Spawn games etc. All of these could be turned into this type of game. Oh and one of the main ones that I'd love to see and would actually work quite well.. Ninja gaiden. I could definitely see Viscera Cleanup Detail: Ninja Gaiden being a thing\n\nBetter wrap this up. As for the main game and Santa's rampage, just take what I said here and apply it to those but the main game is way longer with different maps, other objective to complete, lots of achievements and so much more.\n\nGet these games if it sounds even slightly appealing to you. You won't regret it.","July 26, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After about two hours of cleaning out the splattered walls and floors of the ninja dojo I though I had finally won the game........ I was wrong. This games major flaw is that you cant beat it. The game is plagued by what people suspect to be a glitch. After cleaning up all the mess in the dojo it is near impossible to find the last tiny bit of mess in order to win the game. The "game" has only two achievements. one of them is awarded for beating the game ( its impossible to get this one ), and the second is awarded for filling a box with all the in game money items. I like this small game mainly because it comes free, with a copy of shadow warrior. If you are for some odd reason thinking of buying this game I suggest that you instead just pick it up for free by buying a copy of shadow warrior.\n- Mojoman225","January 23, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All of the cash was acquired with 5-10 minutes using screenshots, and then the mess was all cleaned up within 30 seconds using console commands. 10/10 would walk around for 10 minutes, type two lines into the console and scroll up and down on my mouse for a few seconds again.\n\nSeriously though, it's a chill way to pass the time if you just want to relax and do something relatively tedious for an hour. 100% accuracy should really only be the goal for the achievements though. The game doesn't stay fun for long enough in one go to really aim for a complete clean every go-around. All in all, it's an interesting concept, and I can't really give it a thumbs down, because it's free with a game that I also would recommend. Worst case scenario, Shadow Warrior is really fun, so buy that game and give this a once over to boost your overall profile percentage by a point.","October 19, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This can take at least a half hour, even more if the stain is on the roof or somewhere difficult to reach. Don't expect replay value. I have only played it start to finish 2 times.

In that game you play as Janitor who has to clean up mess after alien movies massacres. Casual fun and jokish simulator, but amusing. This one came out before main game was even finished in 2013 as free offer to owners of Shadow Warrior. They say that they will merge this one into main game soon.\nOh, and it kinda has multiplayer too.\n\nSo, to enjoy the game to the fullest, first you should load up Shadow Warrior and start up new game. Maybe even pick the highest difficulty. Then get into the first fight and take your sweet time slashing people with katana and throwing shurikens randomly at things. Enjoy the blood and massacre. Then once you beat the chapter 0, close the game and load this one up.\nBloody hell, Lo Wang! Just look at all the mess that my alter-ego left!\n(No, don't want to say that VCD:SW copies massacre from main game, albeit it would have been awesome)\n\nThen classic gameplay of VCD goes on, cleaning stuff and then running around with beeper to find that last patch of blood that you would in the end fail to see and you will just mop up the spot around.\n\nIt shows that this one is the earliest VCD on Steam. Unlike Santa's Workshop, there is almost nothing that can go wrong, no dynamite, no way to kill yourself. Some surface, mostly ceiling, thankfully are mess-proof, otherwise you would have never reached blood on the roof. So you can just move on and slowly clean it up for giggles after main game. Hm, main hero alo throws one-liners, not something I seen in other VCDs. They sound quite familar, albeit get old.\n\nQuite amusing.

This and Santa's rampage that is. It is so strange just how much fun I had with these title (Still digging into the main game itself for now) just from tossing bodies into the furnace, mopping up the blood and then taking one last look at the now squeaky clean area that used to be soaked in blood and corpses.\n\nMy only real criticism is that the buckets and bins really don't like the stairs so if you don't lift them up high enough then prepare to go flinging through the air. That's about it though. Wonky bin physics aside, this was worth every bit of money I paid for it. I actually got this and Santa's rampae when I bought the main Viscera Cleanup Detail game so  money well spent\n\nI'd actually love to see more done with this kind of thing. There are several characters out there that leave quite a mess behind them like Kratos fron God of war, Frank, Chuck and whatshisfacefromthebadone from the Dead rising games, Any of the Spawn games etc. All of these could be turned into this type of game. Oh and one of the main ones that I'd love to see and would actually work quite well.. Ninja gaiden. I could definitely see Viscera Cleanup Detail: Ninja Gaiden being a thing\n\nBetter wrap this up. As for the main game and Santa's rampage, just take what I said here and apply it to those but the main game is way longer with different maps, other objective to complete, lots of achievements and so much more.\n\nGet these games if it sounds even slightly appealing to you.

In that game you play as Janitor who has to clean up mess after alien movies massacres. Casual fun and jokish simulator, but amusing. This one came out before main game was even finished in 2013 as free offer to owners of Shadow Warrior. They say that they will merge this one into main game soon.\nOh, and it kinda has multiplayer too.\n\nSo, to enjoy the game to the fullest, first you should load up Shadow Warrior and start up new game. Maybe even pick the highest difficulty. Then get into the first fight and take your sweet time slashing people with katana and throwing shurikens randomly at things. Enjoy the blood and massacre. Then once you beat the chapter 0, close the game and load this one up.\nBloody hell, Lo Wang! Just look at all the mess that my alter-ego left!\n(No, don't want to say that VCD:SW copies massacre from main game, albeit it would have been awesome)\n\nThen classic gameplay of VCD goes on, cleaning stuff and then running around with beeper to find that last patch of blood that you would in the end fail to see and you will just mop up the spot around.\n\nIt shows that this one is the earliest VCD on Steam. Unlike Santa's Workshop, there is almost nothing that can go wrong, no dynamite, no way to kill yourself. Some surface, mostly ceiling, thankfully are mess-proof, otherwise you would have never reached blood on the roof. So you can just move on and slowly clean it up for giggles after main game. Hm, main hero alo throws one-liners, not something I seen in other VCDs. They sound quite familar, albeit get old.\n\nQuite amusing. All yay for this free offer.","December 15, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though I never played Shadow Warrior I say others play it and it’s your typical Hack and Slash shoot em' up type of deal with lots of one-liners, loads of guys with swords, guns and excessive amounts of blood. How is this relevant to this game you might be wondering? Well it was produced as a Pre-Order Bonus for buying Shadow Warrior back when it released then given to Viscera Cleanup Detail buyers as well which as a fan of the game I great for us to get a little more content out of the game like they did with Santa's Rampage. Only this time there is only 2 achievements, both of which are very easy to get and leaves you with the rewarding 100% completion if you've completed the level and collected all the cash.\n\nThe level itself is pretty simple, 2 large rooms with small connecting corridors connecting them as well as stairs to the upper part of each room which only have a little to clean up. Majority of the mess is in the large room and they provide you with 2 furnaces, 1 in each room so you don't have to keep running back which is nice!\n\nThe cleaner takes the role as if he is connected to the Shadow Warrior game with one-liners such as "Hey, I know this guy... Who's laughing now!" when you pick up a head or "I hope these gloves are thick enough" when you pick up glass shards etc. This makes the level really stand out from the others and adds a little fun to the mix. He does whistle every now and then which get annoying because of the high pitch but its fine.\n\n8/10Enjoyable 1 hour map, funny dialogue and easy 100% achievements","June 3","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How is this relevant to this game you might be wondering? Well it was produced as a Pre-Order Bonus for buying Shadow Warrior back when it released then given to Viscera Cleanup Detail buyers as well which as a fan of the game I great for us to get a little more content out of the game like they did with Santa's Rampage. Only this time there is only 2 achievements, both of which are very easy to get and leaves you with the rewarding 100% completion if you've completed the level and collected all the cash.\n\nThe level itself is pretty simple, 2 large rooms with small connecting corridors connecting them as well as stairs to the upper part of each room which only have a little to clean up. Majority of the mess is in the large room and they provide you with 2 furnaces, 1 in each room so you don't have to keep running back which is nice!\n\nThe cleaner takes the role as if he is connected to the Shadow Warrior game with one-liners such as "Hey, I know this guy... Who's laughing now!" when you pick up a head or "I hope these gloves are thick enough" when you pick up glass shards etc. This makes the level really stand out from the others and adds a little fun to the mix. He does whistle every now and then which get annoying because of the high pitch but its fine.\n\n8/10Enjoyable 1 hour map, funny dialogue and easy 100% achievements","June 3","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
