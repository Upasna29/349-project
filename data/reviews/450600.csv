It's the funniest game ever! XD. Except when you realise this person put all that work in on... this... :(\n\nGraphics, gameplay, audio, physics, controls and every other aspect is a total fail. So funny and so sad, I didn't even know what to do. This game needs a complete overhaul of everything.","May 26","false","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"
