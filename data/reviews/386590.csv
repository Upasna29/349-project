Animations are smooth, if a bit simple at this stage, and there was minimal glitchy/laggy experience with the graphics.  There are certain places where if you pitch the camera all the way forward, you can see 'beneath' the ground, but overall nothing that really interfered with gameplay.  The UI is smooth, responsive, and crisp looking with good functionality and is pretty intuitive the way it is laid out.  Hotkeys aren't tooltipped anywhere but with a bit of fiddling you work out that C is for character and I is for inventory, etc.  Overall very impressed with the level of polish.\n\nSound\nThe background/music ambience fits very well, and is engaging and immersing.\nThere seem to be some missing sound effects for things like mining, chopping trees, etc. but not really unexpected for an early access / alpha state.\n\nGameplay\n\nWell, as it stands now, its a crafter/hoarder's paradise. While yes your character's inventory is limited, your trusted floating robot ball thing can carry whatever it likes, and it is easy to switch between the two.   You can happily forage/chop/mine and 'get stuff' to your heart's content and make it into other stuff.  The crafting has a good level of depth, involving quality levels and skill levels and particular materials.  At the moment I've only made the most basic of things, but I see the potential here for an exceptional system whereby different materials convey different quality/effects.\n\nFor example, I have the blueprint for a shirt, and I can either:\nleaves -> fibers - > threads - > cloth\ngrass -> fibers - etc\nor some combination of the two.\n\nEverything is made out of its base components, so if you want to make a hammer, you'll need a head, a handle, and something to fasten them, and so forth.  The crafting UI has little mini icons indicating what is needed and they change color based on what you've got available in your inventory.\n\nAnyway, needless to say, this game completely allowed me to stand there and make thread for 30 minutes, rewarded me with my tailoring level going up, and I was able to make something to wear.   Likewise with making tools, etc.\n\nThere is also a whole construction element (ie building a house) that I've not even gotten into yet.\n\nSkills and stats go up slowly as you do things and the UI gives good feedback on success rates & quality level expected of the resulting item.\n\nI only did minimal combat, killing rabbits to get pelts and meat, but it was fluid and responsive, ie press button-> something happens.  One of my biggest pet peeves in games is a clunkly/slow response UI so I'm pleased to report that Novus did not disappoint in this regard.\n\nOverall -\nThe game is certainly playable now, though I'm not sure how many hours of content are available at this point.  It really looks to be something that I will easily get addicted to once I can make a girl character (since piloting boy characters always feels wierd to me), and once there's a bit more direction.  At the moment there is a lot of 'wander around, click stuff, build stuff' and I hope that this doesn't get lost along the way, as it is pretty relaxing to play.   This may just be the PvE sandbox I've been looking for, and fingers crossed it doesn't end up an open pvp mess like so many of the survival type games out there.  And even then, there's an offline mode in the works.\n\nThe devs have posted up their trello planning tool so planned features etc. can be monitored and seem quite keen on getting things done.  I have to say that compared to other early access games I've tried, many of which I last about 10 minutes in, this is a refreshing change!","November 1, 2015","true","2.7"," 69 of 77 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","69","77","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/recommended/386590/","rankmenotplz","ReadingLies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/","2045 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA brilliant entry for the survival-sandbox game genre which showcases a mix of sci-fi, fantasy and an apocalyptic setting in a very unique way.\nGame Overview\nIn a TL;DR fashion of the game's backstory, humans went full ret@rd and blew themselves up with radiation and stuff so their "Creators" had to reset the entire race and got each of them some floating iron balls to make sure they ain't up to dumb things again.\n\nWelcome to Novus Inceptio!\n\nIn this game, you are basically an Adam or Eve of a newly resurrected world. You are accompanied by a personal robot referred to as "A2-A" given by your Creators to assist you as you thread a new life in these lands.\n\nThere isn't a particular set of goals aside from surviving these lands or to build your home however and wherever you are permitted to. The crafting system that the game offers is very detailed and complex at the same time in terms of the materials needed for each end-product, and are separated in sections which are weapons, tools, alchemy, cooking, etc.\n\nYou can also explore of different areas or dimensions of the game which are referred to as "anomalies", which are still subject to change as the updates come but are currently divided into few types.\n\nThe Pros\nInteresting Game Concept - Along with the very interesting back story and setting that the game has also comes in a great game concept. Some of these concepts really add up to the uniqueness of the game like the aging feature where not only your character ages in time, but also even your surroundings. Another one that I am really fond of is having the freedom to build up your character's skill set is also something that most games doesn't offer.\n\nDetailed Crafting System - The crafting system that this game has pretty much works like every other building/survival/simulation games, the difference that it has from the other ones is that they have made a very meticulous approach on it. For example, some games only require wood and rocks to make a basic hammer and chesto-presto it is done after a few moments of waiting. In this game, however, the materials that you need to provide to make the said tool are more specific, like you would need a rope/string to hold together the wood and the rock, instead just of the two main ones.\n\nCaptivating Visuals - It is pretty clear even from the screenshots of the game that it looks very captivating even without me explaining the whole thing, but if I could add something, it is that it has a pretty clean interface that really looks like your what MMOs in the present day has to offer.\n\nGood Audio - The audio made for this game plays out naturally and the ambience effects really make up the feel as a whole. The sound of a process being completed, the rustling of the leaves, the ebb and flow of the water, the whistling of the birds are some of the examples that this game has to offer in terms of audio presence.\nThe Cons\nWeak Hazard Presence - As of the time this review has been written, there isn't a fall damage factor present in the game, which is a standard in these types of games as it gives a more realistic appeal. Climate penalties also are not present in the current version of the game, in which I hope they developers will add at least before the full release.\n\nNo Multiplayer - Usually, these kinds of games are multiplayer-able even in the early stages since these types of games without a narrative or at least a goal doesn't fare for long, except if the game play is fun. However, as promised by the devs, this feature will come in eventually on or before the game exits early access.\n\nBugs and Errors - Considering that this game is still on its early stages, it is expected to have bugs and errors lingering throughout the game and there are quite a lot of them frankly. Sometimes, there are movement/motion bugs where you go super slow when\nThe Verdict\nJudging from the whole package that it offers as of its current form, it does feel that many things are still missing from it, but it does show the potential to become a great game.\nAll in all, I do think that this game is worth at least the try.\n\nIf you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","May 15","true","14.8"," 60 of 71 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","60","71","5","0"

Anyone familiar with Life is Feudal should feel right at home. Swap the medieval theme for a sci-fi overtone and it's a similar experience.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8u0Ow5Sy1s\nFor day 1 alpha, performance isn't wonderful but it's reasonable, hit a few random ctds though overall quite stable. Graphics look the part, could use a few more options for system scaling. Amazing soundtrack, both the music and fx work is topnotch. UI was readable and translated well, intuitive though further tweaks like multiple crafting slots would be great to cutdown on clicks required. Starting with little more then a knife and some blueprints, running into new tasks during gameplay tutorials popped up offering more information and further guidance.\n\nBiggest issue for some will be running out of things to do. Anomalies appear which could be explored, offering rarer ingredients along with chests containing new blueprints. Fort building is implemented, no terraforming was available. Botany, Fishing, Harvesting and in-depth crafting is in. Only aggressive creatures I noticed were wolves, otherwise you'll be killing crabs, rabbits and deers. Something to keep in mind if wanting to play with friends is at the moment you cannot. Game is played in 'ghost' mode, effectively singleplayer that has all the server architecture in place. Also means a requirement to have an active internet connection. One EU server online, didn't notice any latency issues playing from Australia.\n\nLooking for another survival rpg fix? Novus Inceptio is worth checking out or keeping shortlisted. Just understand it's early days and like most worth a damn (including ARK) they can often take a while to mature. Use a low-end system, expect to spend 10+hrs a day playing 'fresh content' or generally detest grinding? Might leave a little disappointed for now. Will tidyup this recommendation after more game time. Early copy was provided, never changes my thoughts.

He is active on the forums, works hard to make the game better, & is responsive to player's needs. Fixes bugs & updates in a timely manner. Offers assistance freely. I think he has a wonderful imagination & with his work ethics, I expect this to continue to be one of my favorite games, getting better all the time.

The game is already fun as-is - with existing content and features. You will love the game if you like sandbox games - no mission, no quests, just opportunities to explore, scavenge, craft, build, survive - and build your own world. Beautiful graphics and catchy music will follow you on your expeditions. And challenging and slow crafting will make you think about every next step. Please be aware that the game is in a very early stage and so far it is singleplayer only - so the game did not demonstrate its full potential yet.\n\nWhat I like about the game\nEnthusiasm of game author\nHis plans of future of the game\nVisual style of the game\nAlmost every item/resource in the game can be collected and used\nComplexity of crafting recipes, long crafting chains to get final product\nBuilding mode - easy to navigate and place building structures\nPOIs - interesting locations with desert plains, deep caves, desolate islands\nWhat should be improved\nUser Interface is still work-in-progress, should be simplified\nPlayer's animations should be smoother\nContent must be extended, more items to craft and use\nMultiplayer should be implemented as soon as possible - the game becomes boring after some time. Multiplayer is a must to keep people interested for a long time. Yes, we wanna build new civilizations.\nSome number of quests should be available, or at least some ultimate objective\nYou definitely should try this game if you like survival sandbox games. You will like how difficult/complex/slow (choose by yourself) is to progress - which grants you many hours of fun in the game. On the other side - do not invest into the game if you expect some quick action, fast leveling or simple questing in style of "go there and bring/kill...". If you look for anything like that, wait until the MMO multiplayer is implemented.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/386590/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNovus Inceptio is a very Early Access survival game with the intention of becoming an MMO upon release.\n\nI'll start by saying Novus Inceptio seems to be a true Early Access game and by this I mean it still has a long way to go and the developers want to get there with community support and feedback. But though it is very early on in development I can honestly say I already love the game and where it's headed, I just pray the devs don't give up as their plans are very ambitious.\n\nIn Novus Inceptio you find yourself in a world with nothing but a few basics and you must survive. You have health, stamina, thirst and hunger you'll need to watch as these are the things that decide whether you live or die, but don't worry too much right now as there is plenty of food and such to be found. You start with a knife and a chest that contains some food and basic items that'll you need to survive and also some blueprints (which I'll explain later). There is a tutorial with the information you'll need to get started but be warned, it is all text based and pretty long to read from start to finish but this is only because of the amount of features currently in and coming to the game (but as I am sure you can see I am not opposed to walls of text). Right after starting you'll find your first 'anomaly' (again, I will explain further on) which you'll probably want to explore. Currently anomalies are my favourite part of Novus and can be found dotted throughout your world. Once you enter them you are transported to a new 'dimension' where you can explore and scavenge until you are ready to leave. Often these anomalies contain items and things you cannot find in the normal world giving you added incentive to explore further and actively seek them out.\n\nWhilst exploring the Novus Inceptio world you'll find plenty of things you can scavenge for food or crafting. Some of these can be taken with your bare hands but others require an active item which you must craft first such as a pickaxe for mining, an axe for chopping trees, a knife for reeds and many more. There are already a large variety of items which you can find and more you can craft yourself so you'll have a nice amount to keep you busy on the crafting/exploring side of things.\nNovus focuses heavily on it's crafting system which is something I love. Instead of a few craftable items that require one or two base ingredients Novus Inceptio has a vast crafting tree where you have to craft everything from the bottom up. For example to craft an axe you'll first need to craft a blade and a handle with some kind of wood, stone or ore. Some items will require you having some tools built first so if you're very into games that have a lot of crafting like myself then you'll enjoy the crafting system a lot. Each item requires you to have a specific level within your stats in a certain area before you'll be able to successfully craft some items. For example you'll need to level up your smithing to craft better weapons and tools or your chance of successfully crafting will be very low. If you fail to create an item you keep the ingredients but you waste time and stamina. You start being able to craft basic items but throughout the world and in anomalies you'll find many blueprints which you can use to learn new items, giving you yet another incentive to spend time exploring.\n\nRather than having to create a base (you can if you want) you have a drone that accompanies you which you can use to store items in whilst you travel. Since he has unlimited carry space you can explore freely without having to constantly return to a single point in the  map to deposit items making the exploration element of the game a lot more fun. I assume that over the duration of Early Access more items will be added giving you a reason to make a base but currently I haven't really found myself needing one. Also there seems to be no way to hasten movement or travelling at the moment so I feel it'd just limit how far I could travel and explore without repeating the same areas over and over. Right now crafting seems to be limited to tools, weapons, armour and basic foundation items for a base/house with only a few utility items.\n\nCurrently you only seem to be able to level a few of your stats but each stat contributes to a specific skill. To find better quality items you'll want to focus on levelling up your foraging which can be done basically by foraging any items. There are many different skills to level from fishing to smithing to terraforming etc but most of these features haven't yet been implemented and the stats are just placeholders but it is a nice preview of what is to come. If you've played Life if Feudal you'll feel right at home with the levelling system when it comes to the stats side of things.\nThe combat system is also very very limited and if I'm honest it's best to avoid it right now. The tutorial does explain this though so you know what to expect but it didn't stop me trying. It's almost impossible to hit anything currently and the animals move very weirdly. Since food can be found in other places there isn't too much to worry about and combat can be avoided easily so until they've implemented it properly it's seriously not worth the hassle.\n\nIn Novus Inceptio there are two modes currently: Single Player and Ghost. The only difference between these that I know of is whether you require an online connection or not. In Ghost mode all data and such is saved on their server so you'll need to create an account and log in to play in this mode. I think this will be the MMO side of things once that is up and running though the Ghost mode is currently an offline mode. Right now the game doesn't have any kind of online so do bear that in mind if purchasing now. The devs have plans to advance into an MMO one day which is a great but very ambitious idea but there will still be a single player for all those who don't want that kind of experience.\n\nNovus Inceptio has it's problems though, which is to be expected from a small dev team but some of these issues seriously affect gameplay. The first is overall performance of the game. To put it nicely the game runs awfully at some points, and this is even with my settings turned onto the lowest on my desktop gaming rig. I don't know why but there is just awful stuttering in the caves and in general the game just doesn't run great especially when generating a new area. You can actually see it in the videos on the Steam homepage if you want to check it out yourself and others have also mentioned it. I feel the main priority should be optimization but from what I've read this isn't actually the plan so this is something you'll need to seriously consider before buying. My system is pretty damn high end too. Secondly I've mentioned the lack of content but I am sure this is down to Early Access and won't be an issue forever but after exploring it can feel a little aimless. Lastly it'd be good to see the crafting system simplified so if you have the ingredients to craft a sub ingredient it will do it for you instead of you having to find each component individually and craft it.\n\nOverall Novus Inceptio is a game with tons of potential and at its core a very nicely executed idea. The price point is rather high for a game that is in this stage of development but for those of you who consider yourself fans of the genre of and want to be a part of active development then this is a solid purchase. If the developers stick with it and keep actively updating things then I can see this being a hell of a lot better than any of the current realistic Early Access survival games out there.","May 12","true","8.7"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","2"

It’s successive so far. There’s many items to create, the building is alright, the difficulty is quite moderate. Overall, it’s barely above average. The thing really weighing the game down is optimization. It’s just not that good at all. I can run basically any Triple-A game on high-max settings. I can’t even get a decent 35fps in this game, and that’s a sign of just plain bad optimization. There’s currently three game-modes, single-player, MMO mode and Ghost mode (basically MMO mode, where you get to keep whatever you build once you transfer into MM mode, also, players can’t hurt you or your buildings) which is more than expected. I have never seen anything like Ghost mode, it’s actually allowing new players to have a decent chance in survival within a large community.\n\nGameplay\nNothing really special. It’s just what you would expect from a survival game. No real gem in building or survival aspects that I was fond of in my gameplay. Not to say that it’s not decent, because it is, it’s just that there’s so many survival game coming out right now, that every one is the same. So for now, only time can tell if the game will be a gem.\nPros and cons\n\nPros:\nGhost mode\nBeautiful graphics\nSingleplayer\nMultiplayer\nTons of potential\nMany items to craft\nBase building\nYou get what you pay for\nTrading cards\n\nCons:\nNot very optimised\nGameplay isn’t that much different from other survival games\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game.

All "Early-Access"-related bugs aside, there's not much in terms of mechanics implemented or goals to aim for. The thing feels like a nice and colorful tech demo (which is nice), but there's really nothing to do:\n\nSurvival element is nonexistant: food is plenty, just spam a button to collect. Food processing is unfeasible: the final products are rarely more effective than raw ones.\nExternal dangers: no falling damage, the only dangerous wildlife is a wolf who does a glitchy slo-mo attack and is really a snail. But you are too, really: you can't swing your sword while moving, you can't target reliably. Environmental hazards (temperature, weather) have no effect on you (yet?).\nNo inventory management. You can easily carry the weight of the world because the Big Brother the drone accompanying you has unlimited storage. While you have. Which kind of contradicts each other. This is supposedly intentional and will change, but it's how it works now and it makes everything trivial.\nExploration is not there. The stated anomalies are basically everywhere, but there are only four kinds of them, and only one is dynamically generated. The latter ("the cave") is actually a tunnel with random repeating segments / rooms which will make your eyes sore rather quick because of all that repetition. The world is supposedly procedurally-generated, but the generator seed is fixed. And it's just all the same plains, forests and mountains with no places of interest, with few unique graphical assets.\nThe only "progression"-related goal is currently getting all blueprints via exploration. You don't really need the blueprints unless you want to try building houses/base (which doesn't really justify itself - there are no bonuses, you don't need the storage space etc). Collecting blueprints is just a repetitive tasks of visiting the same anomalies over and over.\nResource processing often requires external automation. I finally got myself to learn some AHK scripting, and my "time played" is noticeably inflated by the hours I left the character foraging for minerals or constantly telling the drone to make some mineral extracts etc.\nI'm not going to list the issues that fall into "this is early access" category, though I'd strongly encourage the developer to ask somebody to clean up the string tables, as it hasn't been done in around a year or so, and autotranslated texts (from Polish, I presume) spoil the impression of this product the most.","March 3","false","24.8"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","22","31","2","2"

RPG? MMOs?\n\nNovus Inceptio is the answer to your question and preferences.\nAlothough it's still in an early alpha stage, the developers are doing an amazing job, showing how an Early Access Game is meant to be.\n\nThe crafting system is simply splendid and well done. You have to gather a lot of materials, with an initial small weight capability. Every resource can be gathered in different ways, giving you different materials (for example a tree can be chopped if you have an axe, you can gather branches with a knife, or you can pick leaves or resin).\n\nTo craft items you need blueprints that can be found in chests around the vast (really really vast) world or in anomalies (myserious areas accessible via floating cubes). Crafting requires many materials that most of the time are the result of a previous refining.\n\nChopping and gathering around won't work, you need to plan your resource gathering in a very smart way if you want to survive this harsh world.\n\nThe graphic engine is superb, sometimes I stop to admire the landscape and its variety: for example trees aren't always the same, there are so many species. Specs aren't even that demanding considering the quality this game is offering.\n\nAgain, I am pointing out the Early Alpha stage of this game as I am reviewing it, just to let you notice how developed it already is..imagine in few months!\n\nWhat are you waiting for?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/recommended/386590/","Psygineer","Psygineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/","1508 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntroduction\nNovus Inceptio is a single player, 3D open-world survival game that will one day evolve into a MMO as well. Unlike similar games, the crafting system is far more realistic. It’s definitely showing the telltale signs that it is an Early Access title that is barely into its Alpha phase, but assuming those issues don’t make it to the final product it isn’t really anything to be worried about right now.\n\nAbout the game\nAs with most survival games, you start out with little more than the shirt on your back… in fact… in Novus Inceptio you don’t even start with the shirt. Armed with nothing but a small knife you set off into the world.\n\nRight now, I have to say the best part of Novus Inceptio is the crafting system. I feel I should go into more detail on that description than any other part of the game. In most Survival games I have played, the game takes certain liberties for you. Typically just finding some wood and some stone lets you miraculously make a tool such as an axe or hammer. You probably never stopped to think, “How the heck will the head stay on the handle?” as you happily crafted your new tool. Well in Novus Inceptio it stays on the handle because it is tied onto it with rope. Now there are no magic rope trees or plants conveniently around for you to harvest, you must actually make the rope first. Just taking some grass and stacking it into a pile doesn’t a rope make either! You must craft the components that make up the rope before making the rope! As you can see, nothing is ever easy, and that is what makes Novus Inceptio different from other similar survival games. Hold on there! Just because you have a nicely made rope, some rocks and some branches, doesn’t mean you have an axe! You need to refine those branches to make a handle and you need to refine the stone to make it a more axe like head! So, after many countless crafting steps you finally have your axe. Congratulations! Now make other tools! For the most part, you don’t need to have a lot of tools right way. You are able to use your trusty knife to cut small branches off trees, and you are able to forage around and use your botany skill for other supplies. Besides just building tools, clothing, and other necessities of life, you are able to build yourself a home. At the very least, you are able to design your home even if you don’t have all the supplies you need to actually build it. You will be able to get a feel for what it will look like when it is done long before you actually make it a reality. Currently the home is purely for fun because you really have no need for it. You have a drone that can carry all your equipment and supplies for you. Maybe once the drone doesn’t have unlimited weight capacity a base of operations might become useful.\n\nAnother thing about Novus Inceptio that is different is that your character isn’t immune to the ravages of time. Your character actually ages! What does that really mean? Well basically now there is a whole new way to die in game! Eventually, no matter how successful you were with your survival skills, you will die. Death isn’t the end though; your children will take over your work. If you die to say a random pack of wolves ripping you to shreds, the handy dandy clone-o-mat will bring you back to life too.\n\nAs you wander around, you will see glowing boxes floating in the sky as well as treasure boxes. Both of these things are great to find and worth exploring for. The treasure box often contains blueprints that allow you to construct new and better things. The glowing boxes teleport you to a new area that generally contains a few treasure boxes and a bunch of other useful supplies.\n\nThere is currently some wildlife in the game as well. Most of it is friendly, other than the wolves. They are rather mean if you encounter them. Unless you have prepared yourself to battle wolves, you will likely find your disembodied self shamefully walking back to the cloning machine. Luckily, death is kind of meaningless right now. Other than having to put everything back on your toolbars, you don’t currently seem to drop anything you were carrying. You don’t even have to find your way back to your corpse to collect your “backpack”.\n\nUnfortunately, combat in this game is one of those features that are just barely in there. Battling with a wolf is a weird experience. The way it moves and attacks you is kind of in slow motion. You might not even realize it is attacking you or if there is more than one, which animal is attacking until you have already been injured. When you do turn and fight it is rather difficult to actually connect. If you just spam the attack eventually you will either kill the attacker or you will become exhausted and eventually killed by it. This could be just an issue with my computer, or it could be because the combat isn’t refined yet. Either way, I have to say I did not enjoy my fights against the wolves.\n\nVisually, the game looks very good for the current state it is in. The different zones you can encounter all look vibrant and different from each other for the most part. A lot of detail went into designing the environments. The trees especially look stunning with the bark being incredibly textured. It does have graphical glitches and frequent ground clipping issues though if you are in 3rd person view. It is a little disconcerting seeing your legs disappear into the ground as you walk through the cave. Luckily this is purely a visual issue, I have yet to get stuck or fall through the ground to the great void. Another visual issue is with the dialogue in the game. If you are one of those people who are hyper sensitive to grammar and spelling errors, you might want to shy away from Novus Inceptio for the time being. It doesn’t really detract from the gameplay itself; just it might take you a moment to figure out what it actually is trying to say. One last issue with the visuals is the fact that no matter which settings I use, the game runs a little slow for me despite beating the recommended system requirements. I’m going to assume this is just because the game lacks any kind of real optimization yet due to the fact it is way too early in the development cycle to even think of worrying about optimization.\n\nThe interface in the game is a bit of a mixed bag right now as well. It’s Early Access, so it can be forgiven, but currently you occasionally seem to be unable to move some of the overlapping windows. A few times when I played, I was forced to exit the game and restart it because the interface stopped responding properly (such as not being able to move the mouse pointer to select anything or sometimes being unable to open a treasure box because the interaction window wasn’t appearing). What is good about the interface is that it allows you to have two simultaneous hotkeyed toolbars. One is operated straight with the number keys, the other you press CTRL and the number. If you like, skills you want to use easy and quickly can be assigned to the left bar, and things such as tools, can be assigned to the right. This allows you to get away from having to constantly open your inventory in order to access all your frequently used items or having to scroll tool bars to find the one you need.\n\nOverall, I have to say Novus Inceptio has a lot of potential. Right now it is quite rough around the edges, but as mentioned, it is an Early Access game that is currently in the very early Alpha stages (0.08.005). If you want to give feedback to the developer in order to shape the final game, now is a great time to pick it up. It has most of its core basic elements in place already so you will definitely have something to play around with. If you want a game with a lot of polish then you might want to just put it on your wishlist and watch as it develops over time.","May 8","true","15.8"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","3"

I have played it for more than 1 hour so that in itself means it caught my attention and I plan on continuing playing it. There are a few things that seem to be off such as it takes forever to kill anything; even the little rabbits. I just run from the Lions cause I have no chance against them if I can barely kill a rabbit; even with the knife/sword equipped in the character slot for it. The game is in Alpha still, but they are asking 20 bucks, 16 if you catch this sale, which in my opinion is alot for an early access game that could be dropped tomorrow and left to the community to finish. The mouse sensitivity is off and you can only adjust the x-axis which really can throw you off.\n\nIm currently playing on Normal settings since the fps is so slow on Ultra and High and just feels laggy.

This game is no different, it has a lot going for it but has some more work yet to be done. The most basic function of organizing inventory is impossible, Sometimes things go in the slot your aiming for but most of the time the item has a mind of its own, i.e. several rows below any other item or into some random open slot.\nThe building blocks are VERY buggy, blocks cannot be deleted or don't show that they are built without exiting & re-entering the game. Sometimes you place blocks, come out of build mode & a block is not there but clearly showed it was there while in build mode. Needless to say this slows the game way down if you try to build anything of size.\nOnly having a knife or sword for weapons, this wouldn't be so bad except the hit point on the animals are very bad & inconsistent, coupled with this hitch/hang up of your player while fighting. This same hitch/hang up of your player happens every time you come out of player activities.\nThe crafting mechanic, though an interesting concept, it ties up your avatar while crafting, so nothing else can be done at the same time. This SLOWS game play WAY DOWN!. (I dosed off a couple times while doing some heavy crafting.) As to be expected, these survival games take A LOT of crafting but not being able to do anything else during that time is quite boring. Maybe there is but if not, maybe provide a workbench blueprint where crafting can be done?\nBeing 20 months into development, it's surprising some of these fundamental things are still an issue. The big question for me, does the dev. think these things are an issue & will he or can he fix them? If this didn't happen from a recent update, not having the inventory mechanic working after 20 months is quite amazing to me!","June 2","false","24.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Well, Novus Inceptio is a survival game. This review is about very early alpha, but it's kinda playable.\n\nThe pros about this game...\nThe big one is crafting system, although it is not balanced. If you like survival games with very detailed crafting - this is it. But it is not balance, because first few hours you have to gather leaves and some wood if you want to have some kind of house and clothes. And picking those leaves and then doing the fiber, then thread, then rope or cloth and only then clothes or part of house. This system is great - it is just too slow. The picking or crafting is too slow and very tiring at the moment. But I am saying it again - the system itself is great.\nThe world is kinda vast - anomalies are fun feature, world looks great, graphics are beautiful even in this stage of game, but its empty. Yes i know. alpha. Just saying.\nIt is just fun to craft, but it takes a lot of time.\n\nNow the cons.\nThe game is lagging, I really dont know how, but even when im having ~70fps sometimes the game just itself is having a little lags without the frame drop. Needs optimizing. (Yes i know alpha.)\nWorld is empty at the moment.\nFighting system at the moment is not even close to call it a fighting system. Its...something.\nThe crafting system is great, but too slow.\nThe running and walking system is weird. You just run, cant sprint.\nUsing tools and crafting bars and skills... Just please remake it.\n\n\nAll in all, I know the game has probably a lots of cons, but some of them are just because its an alpha. It has a lot of potential, but so does all survival games, right? But I believe that devs will come through and give us some fun story.\nIf you want to play some survival that you think you are gonna get fast and have fun, don't buy it yet. It is empty and although it looks beautiful, there are many, MANY things to be done.\nIf you want to the survival game that will need a good few hours of running and doing the same stuff all over again - buy it. At the moment it is. I bought it and I'm happy, because it is interesting and it will be interesting to watch how and if the devs will pull through.\nI will probably remake my review a few times in the next few months as the game will progress with versions.","May 8","true","3.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I cannot recommend the game in it's current state.  Other than gathering, exploring, and crafting, there just isn't anything to do - and no compelling reason to do said crafting atm for there is no danger to build a base for protection from.  I do recommend keeping an eye on this one - and I don't think I'm going to refund it, as I think there is a good foundation here for them to build a good game out of.

It has the same mechanics as some games but it definitely made them it's own.\nI've been looking for new MMO for awhile now and it looked like it had enough potential to be something fun.\n\nShort Opinion:After about 3 hours spent on it, the game definitely earns "early access" or "alpha" status. In the most positive way possible.\nMy biggest gripes are with performance and the crafting and I can't see myself *playing* the game for fun at this stage of development.\nIt's definitely a game you should look forward to in the future and if you want to help it be as bug free as possible, pick up a copy ASAP.\n\nStory: 7/10 - Transmission corrupt.The story *IS* there... However, it'll definitely need to be re-written in some parts.\nIt has a good mixture of sci-fi and fantasy, but it needs to be a bit more refined. Some parts sound interesting and others are awkward sounding when read.\nIt is written in English and since the company is based in Prague, (Czech Republic), some of it is in broken english. You can read it and still get the general concept for the backstory.\n\n\nGameplay: 7/10 - Solid mechanics, needs refinement.I will say that I loved everything you can do in the game. Most of my gripes for its gameplay are all based around performance issues and its UI.\nI thought the crafting system was a bit overly complicated, not as in hard to understand but hard to navigate and use.\nTo craft an item you have to open your inventory, open your crafting menu, find a recipe, drag or double click each component to craft whatever you want, click on craft, wait 5-10 seconds, repeat.\nI wouldn't have as many issues with the crafting, cause I do actually enjoy the concept, and since it involves higher quality items produced based on quality of components used, I don't really see a way around the way it's implemented now.\nBut it does get tedious when you try constructing buildings or anything that requires alot of parts.\n\nCombat is about as basic as any other game. It uses actual aiming vs the "targeting" that most MMO's use. It's hard for me to personally test it since the only server at this time is based in Europe. From what I've experienced, I'll say it's definitely good enough.\n\nIt has a similar build system to "Life is Feudal: Your Own" and it's definitely improved upon it. You enter build mode and go into a free-cam state and place objects to build via the interface, really simple and efficient.\nAlso, unlike Life is Feudal: Your Own, building is balanced well enough to provide you something to work towards without dedicating the next two weeks of your life towards building a small cabin.\n\nMy only other gameplay gripe would probably be the death system. I haven't had the oppourtunity to actually test it but from what I've read you basically ghost-walk back to a safezone to respawn.\nThough, it does feature something actually interesting. Your character ages and it tracks your generations of "clones" from your unfortunate accidents. You also won't lose your stats or gear you've gained from playing.\n\nGraphics: 7/10 - Bright lights, big trees.I'm going to say that the strong point for this games eye candy is going to be the world itself, aka the environment. It's a good mix between dense forests and open spaces to provide you with spots to build in without looking abnormal.\n\nModels:\n*Relatively* good, some need to be worked on more. It definitely isn't bad but it could clearly be better. I do get the feeling that this game is using too many polygons in its modeling for Unity 5, though.\n\nTextures:\nIt's hard to judge the graphics in general since even people with god-tier computers will get low FPS in this game if they try turning the graphics up. Regardless, from what I've seen playing on "normal" and "very low", some textures DEFINITELY need to be redone. I'm fairly certain some are only 512x512 compared to your typical 1024x1024.\n\nEnvironment:\nThe game shines here... sometimes literally... The world is randomly generated as you explore it, like minecraft, and it's actually pleasant to look at most of the time.\nI haven't seen any terrain abnormalities or anything else you might see in some games as of yet, the only bad thing is that most objects emitting light glow ridiculously bright.\nNothing that can't be fixed by the developer, definitely not high priority.\n\nSound: 3/10 - Forgettable... literally.I think this is actually a positive thing for the game, as weird as that sounds. I honestly don't recall anything bad or good about the audio, which means it does a good job of blending it in with everything else you're doing.\nI did disable the music simply because I normally play all games without it. The little bits I did hear sounded *ok*, though.\n\nAlso, again, it is early access. *ALOT* of things are placeholder/thrown in just to get it started. It's the way game development works, especially on Unity.\n\nReplay Value: 4/10 - For its state...As I said earlier, it's a game definitely deserving of the title "Early Access". Obviously right now there isn't going to be alot that'll make you stay and your main priority should be testing for bugs to help the developers release patches.\n\nI'd love to give replay value a higher score, it's a issue with Early Access titles vs giving proper, professional reviews. I can't give higher ratings/recommendations based on what "might" be done in the future, or, what might just never be finished.\n\nFinal Thoughts:This game is a example of what Early Access titles should be during the "Early Access" stage. It's something too widely abused by no-name indie "companies" that dissolve after hitting the steam store.\nI do sincerely hope that the developers don't become another part of *that* group. This game has significant potential as long as they find a way to put the effort and time it needs into it.\n\nIt definitely isn't getting the attention it deserves from the steam community, which is a serious disappointment. Playing this game partially reminded me of the first MMO I ever played, "Star Wars Galaxies". Twelve years later, I still want to go back and play that game some more...\n\nOverall, it's early access and it's going to be early access for awhile. This is not a game you are going to buy, start up and be addicted to by any means in its current state. The only reason you should buy this game *RIGHT NOW* is to support its development with your money and your time by helping to find and report bugs to the development team.","May 28","true","3.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Not sure what that was about, but I guess I couldn't live without myself and died.\nHad to keep restarting the game to craft items since the screen would flash and such.\nNeeds to be optimized, but is still early access and all so I expect that will be improved as time flows.\nSo, if you do not care about the above, then by all means play.

The crafting system is actually deep (as in you have to craft each part of your tools before you can craft the tool itself), in addition you can even get various resources from the trees. Essentially you can interact with everything, I actually managed to pick up sand which was unexpected honestly.\n\nThe main concerns as of now would be to really fix the battle system up, it is a straight up horrible experience with no real sense of feedback and clunky. The second concern but not as high would be improving the optimization slightly (to be expected from an EA title of course).\n\nAll in all, if you're a pretty avid survival gamer, keep an eye out for this one.","October 5, 2015","true","1.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lando/recommended/386590/","lando","Lando","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lando/","276 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nVery cool looking game BUT READ THIS!!  If you are in to survival game such as Rust or Ark or LiF or ANY \"REALEASED\" survival game, I strongly suggest you hold off unless you want to support the developers.\n\nThere\'s not a lot to it at this point(5/31/16), and it\'s very glitchy and buggy(It\'s in EA so obviously), so if you\'re looking to delve in to this sweet fantasy world, hit the pause button for a while.\n\nHere comes the review of the game in it\'s current state.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful Landscapes\n-Unique Twist on an Apocalypse Survival\n-Little Robot Orb that Follows you around and carries your crap\n-The building system is pretty intuitive and easy to use\n-The survival gauges diminish at acceptable rates(Hunger, Thirst, etc)\n-real time generation\n\nThe *In-between* (Kinda good but kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as well...)\n-Crafting...  Literally everything.  Rough example.\nYou want to craft an ax to chop some wood?  Of course you do.  To make that ax you need, a handle, a blade, a head, and some rope.(Don\'t quote me on the exacts here I\'m just making an example)\nTo make the handle, you need to make a shaft, and for the shaft you need a branch.  Thank god you only need an ingot or some stone to make the blade, to make the head it was similar to the handle and rope was plant material to fiber to something else then finally to rope.  Crafting was such a chore, but the fact that you could crafting things out of different materials to get different strength items was really immersive and cool.\n\n-Anomolies - These supposed rare floating light shows with a box in the middle take you to another \"world\" briefly and you get to explore next to nothing.  Granted they did mention they are quite useless at this point, but to be honest, the only thing I could see them being useful for would be to tell more of the story of what happened and such, but as of now they are just random places either a desert or a cave or something wherey ou run to the other side and get teleported back out.  But the cave one you can at least get iron and they do have little crates \"from the creators\" here and there that have resources and such but nothing really note worth.\n\nCons... The bad... The crap that will be fixed first most likely, but still it sucks...\n-Combat  - even killing a little rabbit, albiet with a wodden sword, takes a long glitchy time.\n-Movement - since everything is generated in real time it sometimes makes movement feel glitchy or laggy\nTie movement and combat together and it\'s pretty hard to play if you want to kill anything that\'s aggressive.\n-Lack of Story\n-Since survival is so easy there\'s no real driving force to the game.\n\n\nTL;DR - Game has great potential.  Buy It or bookmark it and come back in 6-8 months when they are closer to their goal as a MMO.","May 31","true","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Soundtrack is also fine, BUT. There was something wrong with walking during the rain, but this is probably fixed, so Skip this. One thing i didn't like was walking animation, looked kind of ridiculous. Back to the game, this is something like survival/minecraft thingy. You can build things, you need to take care of hunger and water supply's, fight enemies. You need to try this. Well price at the moment is kind of high 22.39 euros, but since this game is in early access it has some potential.\nOverall rating (at the moment) : 7/10 ( but will go up in my opinion )\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVSwcB0zSUE\nP.S.

The crafting is not simple, but not frustrating either.\n\nYou gain items and new blueprints for items by doing mini-instances found as glowing cubes throughout the landscape, each instance has it's own theme, a desert beach with castle ruins, dungeon type caverns, as well as urban landscapes full of ruined buildings and roads from our time period that look like they have been deserted for hundreds of years.\n\nCatch fish, and kill crabs or rabits, even take down a deer for food, but beware the wolves. Mix herbs with your food to improve them, or simply forage for fruits and veggies.\n\nMake your own tools and weapons from the ore you mine, or the wood you cut. It will be intresting to see what twist they put on this popular style survival/crafting game as time goes on.","January 1","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"The Forest" is simalar to this game but this game takes a more in depth in crafting, and to open survial games. Now becuase this game is very new there alot of bugs, but this game has alot of potential. This game has some similarities from (The Forest, Region of Kings, Rust, Ark, and many others) What is different is the craft is very broken down; now in my opinion they might change this crafting and make it easier, it is a hard crafting system. I say this becuase it takes a long time to craft tier one clothing and everything has to be crafted by ones instead of in bulk. In the future they will add multiplayer. So I will review this again when they are done with most of the bugs in singleplayer.\n\nNOTE: If you like games in early access with open survial games this is for you. The combat system is buggy so do not attack hostile mobs. If you have enough time to biuld a house biuld it away from the mobs that are going to attack you so you do not have to deal with dying alot. The reason why the combat is buggy is that it is hard to fight back, but it is not impossable.","February 13","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I "think" the game is using the Age Of Conan Hyperborea Online game engine and possibly the supplied assets so the graphics and effects are very smooth and professional.\n\nBuilding your own house and many of the basic aspects of the game are implemented and function just fine.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and, while the underlying crafting concepts seem to have been inspired by Wurm Online, the game takes an innovative and interesting approach as far as the gameworld and game specific concepts go. In other words, it feels similar to Wurm as far as crafting goes but is quite unique (afaik) for it's other aspects; exploration, building and survival.\n\nThe devs are active and responsive to player comment and have replied within hours to my posts in their feedback thread so I am expecting this game, unlike so many early access games, to be completed and reach release.\n\nAssuming the games keeps its current quality I expect to be rating it a minimum of 7/10 at that point and I actually expect to rate it nearer 9/10.\n\nAfter 14 hours playing offline I am just about to start playing what they call Ghost Mode in the hope that, since their servers will record it, my progress will be retained to some extent when the game hits its first release.\n\nIn other words ;) Novus Inceptio has properly got me interested and it still has many hours of play in there for me right now even at its current stage of development.","May 28","true","27.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
