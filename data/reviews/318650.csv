Ones with UNIQUE factions let alone unique game design? If you liked old school RTS games I'd pick this up...

I will add/change more as I go.\n\nTDLR version: This is a solid 2D rts game with Tiberium sun/starcraft vibe to it. Singleplayer is solid so far from what I have played. This is not a replacement to C&C or starcraft. Its fun and entertaining never the less.\n\nRecommended towards people who want to get into the genre and hardcore fans of the RTS genre for right now.\n\nWall of text version: This game as stated in TDLR version is a solid 2D rts game. The singleplayer is solid and sort of interesting. The gameplay is fun but the control scheme is a bit weird and something to get used to. As for Multiplayer not much of a scene at all as of right now. The selection of units is pretty good. Gameplay wise its a interesting take but nothing really innovating. There is nothing mind blowing from the game. Here are the upsides:\n\n+Solid gameplay\n+Art work and graphics\n+Story looks promising\n+Sound effects are so far good\n+Content for the price\n\nNow on to complients and feedback. I hope if the developers read this:\n\nNegative:\n-Ai pathing (I ran into a mission when trying to avoid posion clouds the AI had some major problems to taking commands to going around and getting around the map in general)\n\nFeedback:\nIt would be awesome if you guys could add modding tools. It would extend life of the game and I can see a amazing star wars mod to this game. It would sell like hot cakes.\n\nAs for now its all I can think of. I will add as I can go along. When I have beaten the game I will finalize the review. This is my first time I have done a review like this and I hope some of you find it helpful.","December 19, 2014","true","6.1"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","0"

Pretty good game, better than I expected it to be after what I heard of the original release. I like the aesthetics and lighting and I like that the weapons sound like weapons :)\n\nControls take a little getting used to. Squading up and selecting different unit types in particular has led to a few mis-clicks but it'll grow on me :P\n\nGameplay feels solid. Mostly everything feels and responds as I expect it to and the fighting is fun to watch and play out.\n\nThere are a couple things I'm not too keen on. Lack of AA capable infantry is a bit odd but I was caught off guard in my skirmish game so I'm not sure if it will prove to be a balance issue. Also, I don't like how the music goes quiet when there's an audio cue (units being attacked, Need more storage etc.)\n\nAll in all, a pretty good game :)","December 15, 2014","true","8.8"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","33","38","2","0"

Refined classic and simple RTS which was already in development in 1997 finally on one of the major platforms.\n\nIn this game you play as one of three races: Sentinels - mechanized robots that will destroy everything in its path Raak-Zun - mutants who live in deserts or radiation contaminated Federation - the last normal people who are trying to survive in bunkers. Each one has different strategies and units. Of course there is multiplayer, albeit still poorly done, but I think that this is not the biggest problem because it is possible to play. One of the best things about this game is sooooo long campaign of all three races and (at least for me) a great post-apocalyptic story. For those who complain about the short and simple game - I recommend a campaign where you will spend some good time :)\n\nI recommend this game very much, the game is great! :)\n(A review created by SzalonyRandom, not me!)","December 15, 2014","true","40.3"," 42 of 54 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","42","54","3","1"

Base building is a charm with the power-node system, and the resource distribution (four types!) forces exploration and additional base-building.  The game borrows some of the best ideas from StarCraft, Generals, Tiberium Sun and Supreme Commander, and balances them out extremely well; it's less macro-y, faster, and less fiddly than Age Of Empires, but less micro-y, speedfreak tournament hotkey nonsense than StarCraft or Dawn Of War.\n\nIt really feels like some of the best bits of the C&C Games, (sneaking transports into the back of enemy bases), but with a little more depth, and it just has a really solid, classic RTS feel that's familiar, yet fresh at the same time.\n\nThis one is a hidden gem, and has sleeper hit written all over it.  Multiplayer is probably going to be a *blast* with this game.\n\n","December 18, 2014","true","9.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

This is a very well made(I've had no crashing issues or anything playing it so far), and well supported(frequent updates addressing issues, including even one just this morning), indie game that I'd argue should be rated with Star Craft 2 as one of the best, TRUE, RTS games to come out in a while. The plot is fairly boilerplate, but is well executed in the cutscenes, and despite its "stereotypical" framing, is well written and an engaging experience. Graphics, are well, they are the graphics of games ten years ago, only with high deff sprites and partical effects for once, which, in its weird 2.5D way, does look gorgoues during the fire fights. Sound quality is amazing for what the game is, actually really impressed by this aspect of the game.\n\nIf you've got nostalgia for the old days of RTS games, or are sick to your stomach as well with EA for shutting down their online servers...then buy SunAge: Battle for Elysium.","January 12, 2015","true","4.2"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

Better than other newer games like Grey Goo (Which is horrible!!). It's in 2d, but has all the elements to make a good RTS. Voice acting is "Meh", but not too bad. I recommend.\n\nNote: After playing more, I still think it's a very good game,\n\nPros.\n1. I love the specials. Infantry can go into sniper mode and shoot further. Heavy Infantry can use mortars. Every unit has a special when upgraded that you can turn on and off and gives each one a unique feel.\n\n2. Graphics are good. Sprites are very detailed.\n\n3. Sound effects are excellent, music is good. Voices I guess aren't bad but the quality seems off.\n\n4. Cutscenes are cool. Although the panning could go father, and the unit movement could be sped up during these scenes.\n\nCons.\n1. pathing is a horrible issue. Especially air. It is very bad, and will get many units killed. VERY bad, I hope they fix it.\n\n2. Also I think the 4 resources is way too much, by the time I get the 4th resource my other resources run low or out. Would've been better with 2, 3 max. 3 would be pushing it.\n\n3. Would also be improved with all units speed bumped up. I feel like they move too slow. I am still playing with the humans, and so far most of the units I love, except the air units really. The bomber is terrrrrrribly slow to the point of uselessness. Most of the time it seems just using infantry you can win any game.\n\n4. I wish the vehicles could be transported across water. building another base and then another is kinda annoying in island maps.\n\n5. The "storage is running" low thing another annoyance. I don't see the need for storage to increase your resource cap. It's just an annoyance in the game, and the voice is constantly reminding me to get more even after I have gotten more. Never seem to have enough. Game would be better without it.\n\n6. Some bugs. I had a hard time getting nukes to work. I would mark a target, have a nuke ready but could never use it, other times I could. I don't think I am doing something wrong, I guess I could be but I think it is glitchy. 90% of the time it won't work. Also Nuke needs more "Umph" or needs to be renamed, this does not look like a Nuke Strike.\n\nStill with these cons, I think the game is good and worth buying.","July 6, 2015","true","12.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/terroriza99/recommended/318650/","terroriza99","Terroriza99","http://steamcommunity.com/id/terroriza99/","45 products in account","The game is ok. Is it worth 15$ I spent? I guess so. Nothing really wows me, but also there is nothing that is like oh man this sucks I want my money back. (I'm only 90 minutes into SP, have not touched MP yet) It's an ok game with some nice features. I'm sure it will get a nice little bit of playing time when I'm bored with other games here and there. You might very well love it, it all really depends on what exactly you want.. I was looking for something more faster paced and perhaps it will get there as I progress further it is like that in multiplayer.\n\nMultiplayer could totally changed my opinion off this game and I will update once I play online skirmish. If you want a story that you can get into then you will probably like this. One of the main things I don't like is that there is a story and it forces you to be part of it. In these types of games I try to always skip thru all the story and just play. I want to play a RTS to play and could really care less what the plot is, but that's just me. There are several scenes thru the SP where a unit might move from one side to another during conversation taking place and you just have to sit there and wait for it to end which I really can't stand. If that's your thing then it has lots of that for you.\n\nI will say they seem to put a good bit into developing the story, so i'm sure if you follow it, it's pretty good. The game has some cool units and some nice options for the units. Your basic infantry can switch into a non movement sniper mode when you hit A, almost every unit has a special ability like this. The gameplay is very smooth and hotkeys are good for the most part. You can Q up buildings and movement paths for several different squads at once which is very helpful.\n\nThere was one thing I did not like as far as gameplay goes. If I move a squad to a point across the map and they engange an enemy halfway to that point they just keep running while firing and eventually they run past the enemy and keep going to their location. When I changed the stance option from defensive to offensive it did not seem to change this. If my units run into someone I want them to stop and fire or go after them. At least an option to say during the path either stop and fire on contact w/ or w/o pursuit involved or fire and move but don't go off course. Even a way to maybe say go off course to get the kill then continue back on path. This wouldn't be a huge issue in MP b/c it would apply to both teams so it would make it interesting, but in SP it's kind of frustrating. I got the game on sale so I would say overall i'm satisfied, definitely has that old school RTS feel to it. I would say 7/10 so far w/o touching the MP.","December 17, 2014","true","1.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

You definitly deserve more positive reviews than you get ! if you are a old school rts fan I highly recommend this game if your new to them i find this to be a great starting place.","January 9","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","5"

Drawing a rectangle across the screen should select all units inside the rectangle, right? No, that is for putting units into squads, but only units of the same type, except for commander units. It doesn't add anything to the gameplay, it just makes things more complicated.\nThen I noticed the units horrible pathfinding. If there is any obstacle between them and their destination, or a tight corridor, they'll go somewhere completely different, or take a step back, or refuse to move at all. This is especially awful if you take into account that in this game, bases are tightly built clusters of buildings, literally touching each other, or they don't have power. My units also ignored attack commands regularly and didn't pursue enemies. Sometimes they stop just ahead of their target and take fire until they are dispatched.\n\nI had reasonably high hopes for this game, but it's a complete disappointment. The most amazing thing is that even though it came out in 2008, there are still patches coming out for it. The devs apparently care about their game, so why haven't they fixed these glaring issues yet, or given up entirely?\n\nTLDR: Don't buy this!","January 16","false","7.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","6","11","2","0"

Sparks flying, handling shot, careening all over the place.\n\nSelecting units makes them move. It's next to impossible to see which units are actually selected. Grouping is ♥♥♥♥. Pathing is ♥♥♥♥. They won't stay put or stay in formation. It's a telltale sign of a badly crafted game when what frustrates you is just trying to make your units stand where you put them and face in a given direction; without shuffling around, facing a different way without orders, charging, retreating, or just not going where the UI alleges that they will.\n\nOh, and heaven help you if you just want to play the game.

The controls were what really broke my back. You know how in most RTSs when you click and drag around a group of units it selects them all? In this game it will reorganize two dozen of your units of the same type into a squad. This is a game where you can easily have several hundred units, and you need to give commands to them in squads of like ten at a time.

I could never find my rhythm, and felt like I was forever battling with the controls, UI and mechanics of the game... rather than just ...playing the game.\n\nAlso ran into a couple of bugs, one which prevented my from completing a story objective... which is ultimately what made me change from an attitude of perseverance... to one of "I could be doing something more fun with my spare time".\n\nA fine effort, I don't regret buying it, but I am sad I didn't get along better with the game.

However this game isn't without its flaws.\n\nPros\n-----\n\n- Beautiful old skool grafics, a throw back to the 90's RTS genre. Most critic reviews I've read all say that the GFX are outdated, even ancient. Anyone that says this is, I'm sorry, but they're idiots. RTS just don't really translate that well in 3D. Believe me, it used to be my favorite genre yet there are only about 3 maybe 4 3D RTS games that I like. I don't need a rotating camera to enjoy a game.\n\n- Sound Design. Sound it something most people think that it isn't really important, yet most of the units in SunAge have diffirent sounds for their weapons and moving.  The ambient sounds are also a nice addition.\n\n- Campaign. Like I said RTS used to be my favorite genre, meaning I've played a whole lot of them. Among them the C&C games. And I think I can count all the campaigns from every game that I finished on one hand. Most of them or either too hard or too boring to actually finish. Yet SunAge, kept me interested enough to see the ending. Didn't encounter any mission that I found tedious or unfair.\n\n\nCons\n-----\n\n- Pathfinding. Units will act weird from time to time, just small things that you jut notice. Like sometimes units won't be able to walk onto a certain surface but they will cross it. Other times they'll fail to go to the EXACT spot you want them to go to. The  there are those moments when one unit of a group just decides that instead of standing in formation he has to go all the way around past and through the enemy base just to stand at the base of a cliff.\n\n- Skirmish. The game has a skirmish mode against an AI opponent. However this doesn't hold up, the AI is easily defeated and doesn't seem to do that much anyway. Instead it'll build units and attack defences, but at the first sign of danger the units will run away. Only to return as soon as they don't see their attackers anymore.\n\n- Some random bugs. Sometimes I'll encounter a game breaking bug, nothing that crashes the game, just one that prevents me from progressing, usually a reload fixes this. But not always.\n\n\nComplaints\n------------\n\nEven though I really like this game it has several issues that most RTS games have, but this the 21st century after all.\n\n- Airplanes cannot be repaired, even though the game says that you can, you can't. A all too common RTS oversight that I just plain hate.\n\n- Not having the ability to choose your Skirmish posistion. Again a common RTS occurence, for some reason most RTS games will not give you the option to choose your starting location. Which is very annoying because when I play skirmish I want my opponent as far away from as possible. Yet sometimes they'll just spawn right next to you\n\n\nMy final verdict is, if you liked 90's RTS games, you love this hands down. It could benefit from a good clean-up, but then again which game wouldn't.","May 10","true","44.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reason I now do not recommend it is because it's lack of staying power. While I am an avid RTS player, both past and present, and I enjoyed certain aspects of SunAge, the game did not captivate me for very long, relative to other strategy games I have played. The game, while interesting, does not carry with it a certain charm needed to entertain for dozens, or even into the triple digits, of hours. The squad system did grow tiresome, and several control options bugged me. The gameplay is fine for a classic style RTS, but it did not fit quite right. I found myself contemplating how the game could be improved, more than simply enjoying the game. Thus, I found the game good for research purposes, but ultimately inferior to other RTS titles.\n\nMy original review for the game is below, with what I describe still as good qualities of a game.\n\nClassic RTS Fun, Exciting Combat, Good Mechanics and Graphics\nNote that this review has only logged 3.4 hours of gameplay, so I have not delved into the depths of every aspect of the game.\n\nPros:\n\nIn the first 3 hours of playing this game, I can definitely say that anybody who enjoys a classic RTS-style game would enjoy SunAge: Battle for Elysium. I've only played a few of the campaign levels, but I already have discovered a fluid squad system, decent tutorials and understandable controls. Every RTS has a learning curve, this game is no exception, but it is intuitive to catch on to. The learning curve, in short, is short. The combat is also very exciting; the varying units make for challenging, but not overly complex gameplay and the multiple resources and base building mechanic make for an interesting management mechanic which is similar to Age of Empires or Starcraft games (with a few differences.)\n\nMajor good thing: I have not run into any strange bugs or game-breaking issues since playing the game. (I have not tested this in an online setting though.)\n\nCons:\n\nThe only thing that saddens me is the lack of playability online. This is not due to any problems with the game, but rather a shortage of people playing. I know that, it being almost a brand-new release, this game will grow in its player base, but for now there are not a lot of players online. This makes it difficult to skirmish because via the internet. However (not a con), if you have a group of friends, you can play via LAN or Steam connection privately, so that is a huge bonus.\nThe campaign levels are a little bit cheesy, with comic book-style cinematics and not-always-compelling dialogue, but that level of cheese is present in a lot of RTS games and not a large problem. (The emphasis is on strategy as it should be.)\n\nThe gameplay itself is exciting and fun to partake in; I also imagine actually skirmishing PvP would be equally exciting if not more so. Overall, I would recommend this to any strategy fan! If you like it, spread the word so more people are playing!","December 17, 2014","false","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
