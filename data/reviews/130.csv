Yeah, Barney is sort of a main character in Half-Life 2, but this game manages to not get mentioned once throughout that one. Kind of weird, huh?\n\nThe thing about Blue Shift is that it isn't a bad game-far from it, actually, but when compared to the other games in the Half-Life 1 "series" it's just sort of there. Opposing Force introduced new weapons, music, characters and a lot to keep it fresh, while Blue Shift doesn't add a single thing and just rides on the coat tails of the fame that came from games before it.\n\nSo how is Blue Shift (which I just realized has the acronym BS, teehee) not terrible, since I'm bashing it so? Well, it sticks to the core Half-Life gameplay as I said, and you really can't go wrong with it. It's fast paced, balanced, well designed, and is very atmospheric if you allow yourself to be immersed into it. But despite all this, if you've played the games before it, than Blue Shift is just... boring. I don't want to be too rude, because I really do think this is a good game, but there just isn't enough new stuff in Blue Shift to keep it interesting,\n\nIt reuses Opposing Force's soundtrack, gives you only three fourths of the first game's weapons, and the story is...oh, right! That's a good part! G-Man (a staple of the series) only appears once, in the beginning of the game. He's even absent from the ending. This may sound lame, but it's sort of assumed by now that G-man would be really prominent, so having him just show up once is a surprising and welcome twist. And when you think about it, it even makes sense! Why WOULD G-Man bother following some random security guard? It's actually kind of genius in a way. Oh yeah also the way they explain teleportation is absolutely brilliant and makes a lot of sense (no I'm not being sarcastic) and this is seriously the best explanation of teleportation I've seen in my life.\n\nSo, in conclusion, Blue Shift is.. okay. It doesn't pack the punch of the other games in the Half-Life Series (let's just pretend Decay doesn't exist,) and really doesn't have a purpose since it has no bearing on the story, but it's okay and can be occasionally genius when it comes to the story. It's too much of a rehash for me to really love it, but it certainly won't upset any Half-Life purists.","May 16, 2014","true","23.1"," 53 of 54 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","53","54","0","6"

If you loved Half-Life: Opposing Force, the first expansion, you'll probably be very dissapointed with this one, because it adds no new weapons or enemies, but this dosen't mean the game is bad. Also, the game is very short aswell (ignore my playtime).

See Conclusion\nNOTE:Also see my:\nHalf-Life (1) Review\nHalf-Life 2 Review\nHalf-Life: Opposing Force Review\nBlack Mesa Review\n\nINTRODUCTION:Half-Life: Blue Shift is a first-person action game by Gearbox Software and Valve and serves as the third official expansion to the Half-Life franchise.  Unlike Half-Life or Half-Life: Opposing Force, Blue Shift does not introduce new game mechanics; rather, it offers a new type of narrative storytelling through constant interactions with an NPC character (i.e., Dr. Rosenberg).\n\nIn this game, you step into the shoes of Black Mesa Security Guard and Clone Template Barney Calhoun, a man whose normal routine of offering beers and guarding doors is shattered with a catastrophic accident that opens the facility to an alien invasion and U.S. Military intervention (a direct result of Dr. Freeman's experiment from the first game).  As Barney Calhoun, you try to survive the alien invasion, protect the survivors, and escape the now doomed Black Mesa Research Facility.\n\nPROS:+ Good story (NO SPOILERS) that serves as the 'final link' that connects every story (Half-Life, Half-Life: Opposing Force and Half-Life: Decay) of the Black Mesa Incident together.\n+ Constant interaction with an NPC that is essential to the plot rather than for opening doors\n+ The first game in the franchise to introduce 'HD' content during its time\n+ Intense action as can be expected from a Half-Life game\n+ Satisfying puzzles\n+ Adaptive enemy AI, especially with the soldiers\n+ Great level design\n+ Barney can kill dangerous aliens and highly trained military soldiers wearing only a flak vest and an almost transparent plastic helmet as protection (He would be perfect in the Warhammer 40,000 universe as an Imperial Guardsman).\n\nCONS:- VERY SHORT and possibly the shortest game I ever played with only 3 hours of playtime on Hard Mode and Training Tutorial\n- Existence of bugs despite being 14 years old (Particularly a bug where you're unable to move)\n- No new weapons, enemy, or gameplay mechanics.\n- Most weapons from the first game were removed\n- Relatively easy (even on hard mode) as compared to the other games.  In my opinion, it is because acquiring 'armor' and health kits are a lot easier.\n\nCONCLUSION:Story and lore wise, Blue Shift is GOOD but other than that, it does not offer any new content aside from the new player perspective of the overall Half-Life Lore.  In my opinion, Blue Shift is not an expansion but more of a DLC (downloadable content) than anything else, which is not a bad thing by the way, especially one with a good story and fun action sequences.\n\nSo do you buy Blue Shift?  YES but DO NOT BUY Blue Shift alone! Instead, purchase Half-Life Anthology if you already have Half-Life 2 or get Half-Life Complete.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

Oh, wait, it is also the expansion pack (the 2nd one) for the critically acclaimed game Half Life! And this one was also developed by Gearbox. Interestingly, it came more than a year after Opposing Force, the 1st expansion pack, and while that one packed a punch, Blue Shift did not really offer anything new.\n\nSo, there is no real new content here: no new weapons, enemies or new music. But! It is Half Life! And also, you control Barney! The security officer who was bashing the door when you were riding the train with Gordon in the base game.\n\nAnd this is why I liked in Opposing Force, as well. How the new protagonist's story was connected to that of Gordon. You could see a familiar locale in the distance (when in the helicopter in the beginning) or the aforementioned example of the security guard.\n\nIn any case, while Blue Shift did not really offer anything new (graphics-wise it came with a neat high-res texture pack, though), it offered the same cool atmosphere we loved Half Life for.\n\nBlue Shift is a short but all the more entertaining ride! Highly recommended to all Half Life fans!","September 30, 2014","true","0.1"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","43","47","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/recommended/130/","daniel_faraday","Daniel Potter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/","845 products in account","Blue Shift is the second expansion to Half Life. Released in 2001, 3 years after the original game. The development was handled by Gearbox - who one day would create games like Brothers in Arms and Borderlands. Blue Shift, was in fact their second game, so you could say that Gearbox was still learning.\n\nThe game consists of 5 Lengthy Chapters and 3 "5 min" Chapters, so the overall experience is very short.\n\nOne thing that i didn't like is that the plot didn't really collide with the plot of Half Life 1, all that much. There were a few cameos, but overall, it felt really separated. Basically, you help a group of scientists fix the teleporter and teleport out of the Black Mesa Facility. The only cameo is at the start of the game when you see Gordon riding the train.\n\nGameplay wise, it's basically the same as the original game, except there are no "Class 4" Type weapons (gravity guns and such).\nThere are also puzzles in most of the levels, though, they do lack in quantity.\n\nIn the end, i like the first expansion (Opposing Force) much more. This expansion is short, pretty much all assets are reused from the original Half Life (barely anything new), and thematically it just doesn't do a good job, unlike its predecessor - Opposing Force.","November 20, 2013","true","5.4"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","39","42","0","0"

This Blue Shift is the second rather dull expansion pack for Half Life 1. To be blunt, the first expansion Opposing Force is better, because it offers more guns, new gameplay mechanics and a lot of new monsters. Blue Shift however offers nothing new except new levels that will take you under 4 hours to complete the first time around.\n\nBlue Shift takes you through Black Mesa and Xen once again when everything goes wrong and aliens invade. You start the expansion riding the tram to work (just like Half Life 1) after taking an optional training course that is literally the same training course from Half Life 1.\n\nThe gameplay is more challenging than the original game in both good and bad ways. The good way is the game shows off its artificial intelligence by pitting you... Barney Calhoun, a blue shift security guard at Black Mesa, against hundreds of marines sent into the Black Mesa facility. Usually you fight 10 marines at a time in wide open areas. The enemies will scatter when you throw grenades, run away from you, try to flank you and fan out so you're not shooting enemies like dominoes.\n\nThe negative ways that the expansion is challenging comes from several dark areas with dozens of head crabs jumping at you around every turn. It feels cheap compared to Half Life 1 and Opposing Force.\n\nThere are a few shining lights for this expansion and that is rescuing scientists, although it's not much of a rescue, because any of them can die and it doesn't matter. The expansion also dabbles in having an important character Dr. Rosenburg that you will rescue and he will guide you to the end of the expansion. Guide you as in briefly tell you what to do through believable voice acting.\n\nIn all this is a lackluster expansion compared to the previous one and feels more like a level pack... without levels, just one continuous game. Chances are you can get this expansion with one of the deluxe Half Life 1 games, so save some money and get Blue Shift there instead.","February 21, 2015","true","3.6"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","25","29","2","9"

Gone are the stupid weapons and enemies and back are the really good ones from the original. The first half of the game the quality of the mapping is about the same as Opposing Force’s, but in the second half it does get a lot better. There is also a considerably better flow and story compared to Opposing Force, here there actually is one compared to the no existent one in Opposing Force.\n\nThere are no reused sections, although some did seem to take a lot of inspiration from Half-Life’s. However there is a heavy use of sections where you need to go a long way around just to open a door, this is done multiple times. Also not all the weapons are used, this is a good thing is some ways since everything in this game was not out of place, but there are still some non-energy\Xen weapons that are not used.\n\nThe main problem with the game is that is it too short, it really does feel like they made half the game, then ran out of time. This would explain the lake of weapons and also the lack of difficulty increase, there is no end boss and the end point does feel like a mid-point.\n\nBut this game is really good, if you had to choose between this and Opposing Force, choose this.

Just because I love when games/sagas or, in this case, the expansions of a game connect with each other in such direct ways.\n\nBlue Shift was pretty good. Incredibly short, it takes the average gamer four hours on Hard (I presume) to beat, but it was good nonetheless. You simply would expect more from a franchise with an assload of long, and sometimes, very challenging chapters. They didn't add anything new in this expansion (as in guns or creatures), but it's not a bad thing from a storyline standpoint, since the game takes place on Black Mesa, near the same sectors you're in when you play as Gordon in Half-Life. The only "complaint", I'd say, is that the game was very short. But I enjoyed it, seeing things through Calhoun's eyes (I love Barney, got a damn crush on him) was interesting, and some parts were very well made and well thought-out. Not going to spoil for those who want to play, but to those who have played it: Chapter 6, "Power Struggle". Dynamite detonator box. Barrel on a corner to your right. You played the game; you might understand.\n\nI recommend it, but only if you have played Half-Life. I doubt you'll enjoy it if you haven't played it. Quite the contrary, I think you'd find it dull. So buy it and play it if you want some more of Half-Life in the Black Mesa Facility.","February 7, 2015","true","4.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","0"

As with Opposing Force and Decay, this game was developed by Gearbox using assets from the original Half-Life. Blue Shift is by far the shortest of the four campaigns, beatable between 2.5-5 hours depending on the difficulty and your experience with first-person shooters.\n\nThis game's initial presentation is very good, but its short traversal and occasionally awkward puzzles put a "damper" on things. There are lots of homages to things that happen in Half-Life, Decay, and Opposing Force. The first chapter is really immersive and is a pretty good setup for the rest of the campaign. Unfortunately, Calhoun is relegated to doing the most mundane stuff in the facility, and it really feels like his story is the least important of the four.\n\n****SPOILERS AHEAD****\n\nBecause of the game's brevity, it has to compress things greatly, which sometimes works to the detriment of the game. The difficulty escalates much more quickly than in any of the other campaigns. The second chapter is probably the best, but figuring out what Gearbox was thinking with two of the puzzles (i.e., the weird machines you manipulate vertically and going down an obscured ladder to a completely different area) are hard for me to understand why they were chosen. The third chapter introduces marines and this is where things really get hairy. Unlike every other HL game in my experience, the marines in Blue Shift seem to spam the MP5's grenades the most. It feels artificially difficult because the grenades are very damaging and hard to see coming to dodge.\n\nAlso in the third chapter, there is a bit of an escort mission, which is exceedingly annoying because the guy decides to stop following you because he says he's tired. Sometimes this happens after he says he'll follow you and not take a single step. Other times he'll just rush ahead of you, which is also annoying when he gets in harm's way. One of the funniest experiences I think most people have had with him is him saying he won't go another step when he's right in front of the security door that he's been ♥♥♥♥♥ing about getting to.\n\nAnyway, after that chapter, you get sent to the alien homeworld and there's a mess of convoluted mazes. This was also the chapter that I discovered Gearbox's proclivity for constantly placing headcrabs right around 90-degree corners in order for them to almost always get a hit on you just because you couldn't see it coming. I thought this was also pretty cheap. There might be multiple ways to get to the destination but I can foresee people getting confused and frustrated with the random organization of everything. Do you take the left path or the right path? It's a lot of trial and error, I think, and I guess I just got lucky. There's also a really annoying platforming section where you have to basically save on every platform. But once you get past that, there's a kind of extended waterfall section that actually feels like it could belong in the original Half-Life. It's certainly better than the factory in Interloper. This is also where you'll encounter almost all of the enemies that Gordon dealt with on Xen, except far, far fewer. After aligning the machinery on Xen, there's again a bit of a head-scratching moment to figure out where to go. You just jump on some crumbled rocks to reach an upper area, d!ck around for a bit (which feels unnecessary), and then find an arbitrary portal back home.\n\nThe fifth chapter is the longest and in my opinion the most annoying. You have to find a power cell (battery) in a lower section of Black Mesa. Unfortunately things aren't as intuitive as they should be. For instance, you have to use a barrel as a conduit for a broken wire connected to some dynamite and an explosive lever. You also have to lower the coolant levels just to move some barrels, then raise the coolant levels to jump on the barrels to cross to the other side. But the worst offense (and this is the worst part of the entire game) is figuring out the one extremely random hidden button that raises a bridge to cross to a section you probably didn't even see. This is where the game's lack of explanation drove me batsh!t insane. Anyway, once you figure that all out, you charge the battery and send it back.\n\nThe last chapter is pretty easy, you just have to open the damping fields to let the scientists through, then open them for yourself and go through. This is supposed to be tough because of the military guys, but if you know where they're coming from, you can plant a mine and take them out easily.\n\nThis game isn't really all that long but it's decent for what it is. There are definitely some moments that are good but probably an equal number of moments that hit with a considerable clunk. It definitely doesn't have the gravitas of the other HL games and some of its puzzles are more annoying than anything. By far the aliens and military spawn point placement in Blue Shift feels the most d!ckish of all the games. But if you can handle those minor annoyances, it's fun to play. But if you're debating between this and Half-Life or Opposing Force, this should be the lowest on your list because it has the least content and feels less substantial (although Calhoun gets the best ending, in my opinion).\n\nP.S. I know it says I have only six minutes in the game. I beat it having "changed game" after having started Opposing Force.","March 10","true","0.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","1"

I REALLY want to go in-depth with this game, people... but it's just too short to say much about it... so... I'll try...\n\nBlue Shift is another expansion pack for Half-Life 1. Much like it's predecassor, you take the view of Barney Calhoun, a security officer working in Black Mesa and a personal friend to Gordon Freeman. Here's the thing that probably many people wondered in their Christmas of 2001. Opening the game up from the box, popping it into their brand-new Windows XP computer, and watching the opening sequence, and noticing something different... the outstanding graphics for the time. Seriously, as far as I know, this game is only famous for two things, Barney appearing as a major character in Half-Life 2, 3 years later, and the graphics in this game for 2001, as Opposed, *ahem*, opposed to Opposing Force and the original Half-Life. If you had essentially the i7 type of computer of back then, and were one of the cool kids already with a GameCube, PS2, and original Xbox in your possesion, you were amazed with the visuals of Blue Shift. But, I'm sorry to say... that's really is almost the only reason this game is... well... was known. The story is about as basic as it can get.\n\nBarney Calhoun is doing duty as a security officer in the Black Mesa Research Facility and going down an elevator when, shock, the facility experiences a Resonance Cascade caused by Gordon Freeman submitting a Xen(ian) crystal in a test chamber for analysis, causing confused alien species to enter Black Mesa and vaporise all the remaining employees at every turn (satisfying) and your goal is to, you guessed it, escape the facility with the few surviving scientists guiding your way to a possible exit, while killing all the aliens that you can kill. Eventually, though, Barney is able to teleport himself at the surface of the facility, along with Dr. Rosenberg,  shortly after witnessing a montage of the events Gordon Freeman faced. He supposedly drives away along with a few scientists in an SUV to safety, away from Black Mesa.\n\nPros: Graphics and animations were innovative for the time. The game also served as the basis for Barney's purpose in the next Half-Life game, Half-Life 2, and did it fairly well.\n\nCons: Game felt EXTREMELY short and, personally, I just didn't find Dr. Rosenberg very interesting. Only took me about 2 hours to beat, and 4 more just to TRY Hard difficulty and to see if it made a difference, but just felt like the first Half-Life game on Normal. Speaking of which... the Easy mode of Half-Life: Blue Shift is just about the most boring excuse of a Half-Life game I've ever seen. I'm sorry, but I don't find the constant, constant, CONSTANT health packs, ammo, suit health, and health machines ALL over the friggin place to be like a Half-Life game. To be honest, HARD mode seems to have this down... it makes the health packs, etc. give you LESS health, suit health, etc. But in Easy mode... I think I had a harder time playing the 2nd stage of Portal 1. Also... no G-Man.\n\nOverall, it's a passable Half-Life game. It still has the dark humor as the other titles, and the story, while short, still felt like a good distraction from time to time. Only play Blue Shift if you're EXTRA curious about the story of Barney Calhoun. Wanna know how short the game is? Writing this review took longer than the game itself, lol.\n\n7.0/10","September 1, 2014","true","6.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

Scientists find a way to another dimension, and where are you when it all happens? In the elevator, like a chum.\n\nAll of the aspects of Half life, thrown into a smaller and shorter story.\n\nI loved it\n\nIt may be short, but there are a few puzzles that make you run around a bit, even though the answer was right in front of your face the entire time. Alteast that was the case for me. As I played, I made my own way of what weapons to use against what enemies. How to take them down and so forth. If you know how to B-Hop, then the movement will go a lot quicker. If you dont? Get a script, it will really help with the movement in this game. It honestly would have taken me an extra half hour not b-hopping to finish it.\n\nBut in all reality, a very good classic. Glad I bought it again on steam.

This time you assume the role of security guard Barney Calhoun, during the events of the original game. Just like the original game and Opposing Force, your main objective is to survive by assisting fellow Black Mesa Employees, using any weapon or tool to your advantage and by using your wits. Blue shift does just that.\n\nGameplay wise, It's still the engaging Half Life everyone knows and loves. Real Time cutscenes? Check. Aggresive and sophisticated enemies? Check. Reliable friendly NPC's? Check. Clever puzzles and well designed levels? Check. And the epic and intense gunplay that the original had? Yep, it's all here. Graphically, it's just like the previous games. The levels look as varied as ever, and the audio still breaths a great atmosphere into the game. So far, everything that is included in this expansion is good.\n\nBut it's the worst installment in the series.\n\nAnd why, do you ask? Because, unlike it's predecessors, it's really short. Really, really short. And unlike Opposing Force, it didn't really add anything new. OK, maybe the HEV battery pickups have now been replaced by Body armour since you are a security guard instead of a heavily armoured scientist/soldier. But... other than that... that's it. No new guns, no new NPC types, friendly or enemy, no new level obstacles and gimmicks, no nothing. Hell, it even lacks some things from the original Half Life, such as certain weapons and an end boss. With an impressive expansion like Opposing force being released before this, I was honestly expecting to see a lot more, but instead, it feels like a watered down Half Life. It's still nice, but it could've been so much more.\n\nOverall, Half Life: Blue Shift is a fairly decent expansion, although a tad bit underwhelming considering the content it's two predecessors delivered before it. If you enjoyed Half Life or Opposing Force, I'd say you check Blue Shift out. If you never played either of those two, this is not the best place to start. It's way too short and light on content and the other Half Life games deliver so much more. Get those instead, then buy this during a sale.","April 26, 2014","true","4.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a good deal shorter than the core game, especially highlighted by a scene at the very end that shows that the story wraps up long before Freeman finishes his side of things. Its weapon selection is much tighter, with nothing really left as a useless gimmick - like the core game's Alien Bee Launcher, which pretty much served solely as a last-ditch weapon when you were out of ammo in everything else - or basically anything that runs on what I've come to call "Science Ammo." And finally, without getting in your way the plot is much more directed, providing you with actual motive to move from Point A to Point B besides "because there's no other direction to move in."","September 25, 2014","true","6.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's events occur alongside the main game, beginning shortly before the Black Mesa catastrophe, and ending about half way through the story of the main campaign. Because of this, I'd personally recommend playing it before Opposing Force, as the events take place before that DLC's occurrences chronologically speaking.\n\nIn Blue Shift you play as one of the security guards at the Black Mesa facility, whose name is Barney Calhoun. You will make your daring trek through the complex in hopes of escaping the ongoing calamity, and there will be lots of shooting, puzzling, and storytelling experiences along the way. Other than the plot  shift  *wink*, nearly everything in my review of the main game applies to Blue Shift aswell.

Blue Shift scraps many superfluous weapons from the first game, settling on a modest but satisfactory arsenal. Its storyline, the events that occur and the spectacular sights, along with some quite satisfying puzzles, will keep you entertained the whole way through; that said, it's not very long, as the duration of the game only spans a somewhat 'measly' 6 chapters, so it barely even has enough time to wear out its welcome. However, several high plot points and subtle (or not) details that serve to further intertwine its story's timeline with that of Gordon Freeman himself make the game wonderfully memorable and worth playing, especially if you've played Half-Life first.  Simplified, short, and pretty dang fun, Half-Life: Blue Shift isn't quite that full of a game in its own right, but it seems "just right", with a reasonable arsenal, and a far more manageable length than the first.  Considering it's more of a sister story to the first game, I might even say it serves this function--and then some.  A short but sweet and enjoyable ride.

You play as Barney the Security Officer.  He makes a few cameos in the first game (and in Half Life 2 is a major role).  Opposing Force has you playing a soldier from the US military doing missions during the play of the Half Life game.  Blue Shift is the same.  In Half Life, Opposing Force, and Blue Shift you are all playing in the same time period, just different roles.\n\nNow for the game itself.  It is short.  It isn't crap, though.  It is quite well done, and shows a bit of the inner workings of the Black Mesa compound.  If you haven't played Half Life 1 then you might be confused on what exactly is going on, but if you're just looking to play a short singleplayer FPS, then this is something to hold you over.\n\nI bought it back when it was around 10-20 bucks.  I don't know the price of it now, but I wouldn't pay more than 5 dollars.  If it's not 5, then wait for a sale.  It really isn't worth more.  The only reason it isn't worth more is that you can complete it in 2-3 hours, maybe even less.  But the gameplay is still fun and interesting and has the original Half Life touch to it.","July 3, 2011","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I see I am left with only one choice, go outside. Ha, not bloody likely. I guess I’ll continue with the retro shooters scene. Blue Shift dynamically changed Half Life by making you play as neither the jocks nor the nerds but the would-be of both groups, the security guards; a prospect that made me shake in my booties. Oh and would you look at that, another double name that refers to both the character and a scientific term. Oh Valve, you unscrupulous little geeks. It’s like next you’ll follow up with a console exclusive called “Half Life: Decay” which had a focus multiplayer. What a sick twisted world that would be, huh. Then again, we don’t speak of the dark times to come. (Cough) AC: Unity (cough).\nOn the surface the game is about an alien invasion, but deep down you see a much more compelling story. The story of Barney the mute security guard who recovers from his lack of speech as is seen in Half Life 2; hint hint upcoming piece (cough) hint. Blue Shift was the shortest by far, but it brought with it updated textures for the graphics junkies for which I have no respect, and yet I have no disrespect. In other words don’t talk to me and we’ll be just fine. This game is marginally more open than the previous titles and I found myself breaking down a wall to a much later part of the game earlier, so there’s that. A concept Eric Hirshberg is still trying to figure out. This piece was made with a tad less effort, yes.

Having been both fans of the original Half-Life back in the days we both enjoyed playing this new episode, impersonating a security guard in the Black Mesa Research Facility.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's the same as in Half-Life but with some changes in what is mechanics and weapons. Just some minor tweaks. Some locations are revisited, some moments of Dr. Freeman's voyage through the installation can be witnessed, and there are many new locations never seen before.\n\nAs an expansion to the original game, this game is a blast and kicks ♥♥♥.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brackbrackbraaack/recommended/130/","brackbrackbraaack","Official","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brackbrackbraaack/","309 products in account","Pros\n-Still looks and feels like a Half-Life game/story.\n-You finally find out which random security guard is Barney Calhoun. And it would seem that it was none of the Half-Life guards!\n-Overloaded with easter eggs, especially near the beginning.\n-HEV chargers are still operational despite the fact that you can't use them. I just found that amusing.\n\nCons\n-Has some really outlandish puzzles, even more-so than certain Valve puzzles could be. How was I supposed to know that pushing a barrel over two broken wires equals MAKING THE DYNAMITE EXPLODE?\n-Easily the shortest entry in the Half-Life series, even shorter than Half-Life 2: Episode 1 (and I play games at a snail's pace).\n-Not much new content in general when compared to Opposing Force. No new weapons, enemies, etc. I mean, there's a new character, so I guess that's something...\n-The closest you get to a final boss is making sure the teleporter doesn't explode or whatever.\n-There's a REALLY annoying bug where, if you die and respawn by clicking one of the mouse buttons, your weapon will constantly fire off until you click the mouse button again. I'm not sure if there's a fix for this or even if it's just me, but just be wary of that.\n\nConclusion\nOut of all of the entries in the Half-Life franchise, this is probably the least impactful. In fact, I'm willing to bet there have been mods for Half-Life that both continue the story in its own way and left more of an impact to the player. That being said though, this expansion isn't bad by any means. Just not quite as good as other games in the series.\n\nIf you want this game, I'd recommend buying one of the Half-Life complete packs if you don't have a large number of the other entries. You'll get the other entries and save money overall in the process.\n\nScore rating: 7/10","May 23, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/130/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Half-Life was one of the first FPS to propose a complex story, with graphics still angular but with the best 3D for 1998. You were Gordon Freeman, a scientist turned hero for the Black Mesa staff, in a place where an alien invasion was happening, where Marines and Black Ops were the "cleaners". G-Man, mysterious man with a case, was monitoring you.\n\nThe game was a real success and an add-on was released in 1999. Opposing Force was shorter than HL (normal for an add-on) but with the return of the G-Man, with new weapons, new enemies. One big difference: you weren't Gordon. No, you were Adrian Shepard, corporal in the HECU, belonging to the famous Marines who were adversaries in HL. You were a Marine now but fortunately, you changed your mind: no more scientists or guards killings, as you can suppose that they'll be an useful help.\n\nHL, HLOF and Blueshift are the three main games of what we can call, now that that Half-Life 2 and Co. are released, the Black Mesa Era. So what is about Blueshift?\n\nThe Black Mesa Era is special because of the multiple points of view you can play. Gordon was the scientist side, Adrian the military one, so, it was missing the guard one.\n\nMany can argue that we could have played a Black Ops, a Xenian (the mod Point of View is taking the matter in its hand), the woman that was pushing the crystal (the exclusive mission on PS2, Decay, is taking the matter in its hand, as the mod Decay, a port for PC of this mission) or anything else (a janitor - well, a mod is existing, an external person - the mod Half-Life Visitors is... oh well, you know what I mean). But Gearbox choose what was called Barney, the guards of Black Mesa, taking that name for making an hero. It could have been Otis, it would have been really funny to be healed by donuts.\n\nSo, you're returning into Black Mesa Hell. You're Barney Calhoun, a guard, beginning your adventure before the incident triggered by Gordon. Then, eventually, you will have to fight your way in a chaotic facily, trying to escape, finding a certain Rosenberg and... well, it's not a spoiler, Barney did escape Black Mesa, like Gordon and Adrian, apart from the fact that he was still free.\n\nI need to say something: it's a stand-alone, where a lot of gamers tended to call it an add-on.\n\nStory is basic, hell, it's just another day in Black Mesa, so don't expect something different. See the community mod for it. But Gearbox did a crime, an offense in the Half-Life Mythology.\n\nG-Man is appearing once. What? Half-Life 2 Episode One did the same? Hey, the story was about saving Gordon from him. But G-Man did come back in the next chapter, still following Gordon.\n\nG-Man was interested in Gordon and Adrian. But not in Barney Calhoun, who is in the Combine Era one of the most famous Resistance leader. G-Man was involved with Eli and Alyx Vance's story. Why not with Barney, who is one of the few that were really struggling. Where is my fun to spot G-Man?\n\nGameplay hadn't change a bit and I don't complain about that: it's Half-Life, I mean, you have to climb ladders, find a way to kill enemies when your weapons aren't sufficient, you have to be careful when nearing toxic areas and when you're jumping on Xen...\n\nThe game had a big bug, meaning that you're obliged to download a patch: Flashlight wasn't working. Other negative point is that you can't use the HEV device for protection... in total contradiction with Adrian Shepard, not belonging to Black Mesa, who can use it! Also, BlueShift didn't solve the problems of these dangerous ladders when it comes to climb down.\n\nGraphics are still the same if you don't install the High Definition Pack. If you do so, the HDP is making the characters less angular, your environment is less sterile and a new skin is given to your weapons. Anyway, Blue Shift's graphics are good if you're not allergic to "old" engines.\n\nWith an established universe like Half-Life, Blue Shift couldn't forget to make some references to the two previous games: you see Gordon in his tramway when you're trying to enter to your department for work (a scene present in the original Half-Life) or just before he's entering in it. You're seeing him in the Sector C, walking to his destiny, you're seeing the famous crystal that will triggered the portals being carried to its final destination and last but not least, the professor you're rescuing is thinking that Gordon will not solve things, that it's a foolish idea to believe in him. Oh, have I mentioned that the last you'll be seeing Gordon is when he's captured by the Marines? Next time, it would be years later, in City 17 train station. Well, Blue Shift is taking place at the same time of the first part of Gordon's story, so, it's normal to have a lot of references to Half-Life. For Opposing Force, the only mention of Adrian Shepard is made by a Marine when throwing Otis, the fat guard, in a pit you're climbing.\n\nBlueshift is really lacking of novelties. It isn't bringing something new besides the story. Barney only uses Half-Life's weapons (no Opposing Force did make it) and worst of it, he has less than Gordon. No more experimental weapon, no more crossbow. Then, the enemies are reduced to what Gordon encountered (less the giant boss like Gargantua), so, no Race X from Opposing Force. And last but not the least (for me), soundtrack is good but isn't renewed like in Opposing Force. No new tunes, no new sounds, well, it's kind of frustrating for me who loves soundtrack, particularly when a game set in an universe has a different music than the others.\n\n\nFinally, Blue Shift, for a stand-alone, is shorter than the add-on Opposing Force... who was shorter than Half-Life. Five hours of playing (and more if your flashing is buggy) isn't enough for Half-Life. Well, the episodic games set in HL2 universe are as short as Blue Shift but the content is more extended than Blue Shift's. Here, we're in 2001, players were waiting for HL2 and well, they're in the right to expect much more for HL. It was like the game was rushed for giving something to impatient fans.","November 19, 2010","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When everything goes to hell...err....Xen, he tries to help the scientists and escape from the facility himself. It's a fun little romp back through Black Mesa, but it is no different mechanically from the original game - it does not add anything, and is missing some of the features of the original game.

I recommend everyone plays this first after Half-Life and before Opposing Force for various reasons I will explain. The ratings and my feelings of this expansion are gauged in relation to the first Half-Life.\n\nSTORY: 9/10\nYou play as Barney Calhoun, security guard. You are actually the security guard you see banging on the door at the very beginning of Half-Life, pretty cool how it's all linked. You experience the events of the resonance cascade but at different parts of the facility. Your main goal is to escape with the scientists. The story actually isn't bad, but it ends kind of abruptly and feels like there should have been a little more.\n\nGRAPHICS: 9/10\nThese are the same graphics as the original Half-Life which is both good and bad. The good part is it all looks the same and this expansion came with an HD pack for all the original Half-Life games. The bad part is that when this game came out in 2001 the graphics were starting to look dated even for the time. This isn't a big deal to me as I enjoy the graphics (with the HD pack).\n\nSOUND: 9/10\nThe sound is the same as Half-Life. Not changing the alien sounds is fine, but I would've liked some new voices for the guards and scientists. Although there is a new voice for a certain scientist, that's it.\n\nWEAPONS: 8/10\nThe weapon system works the same as Half-Life but you get a fewer selection of weapons to play with and no new ones. This is very disappointing.\n\nENEMIES: 9/10\nYou see a return of nearly all of the enemies from Half-Life, but that's it. There is nothing new which is again disappointing.\n\nLEVEL DESIGN: 10/10\nThis is the only part where this game lives up to Half-Life. The level design is very similar and the few puzzles and situations where you must figure out what to do are very fun. And you get to revisit my favorite level!\n\nLENGTH AND REPLAYABILITY\nThis game is extremely short, clocking in at 2 hours, 2 and a half if you play on hard and take your time like I did. Still, it is fun to play as Barney and re-experiencing the levels in a future playthrough is certainly viable.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 9/10\nThe game is good and well made, but rushed and without any real new content. You should play this before Opposing Force because if you play it after you will be disappointed expecting this to at least be on the level of content of Opposing Force. If you liked Half-Life, this is still a must play.","October 25, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This expansion pack brings us to new areas of Black Mesa, unseen in previous games and there are a few Gordon Freeman cameos throughout.\n\nWhat made Opposing Forces’ gameplay so much fun and memorable was the fact that Gearbox introduced new weapons and enemies. Unfortunately, in Blue Shift, all the weapons and enemies were recycled from Half-Life. Dr Rosenberg’s companionship was a new gameplay aspect introduced in Blue shift. Unlike other scientist in Half-Life, who only have 4 character models, Dr Rosenberg has distinctive facial features and is an essential character who makes multiple appearances throughout the game. As well as this new feature, you can look forward to the return of fun but difficult puzzles and awesome shootouts against aliens and soldiers.\n\nLike Opposing Force, the graphics in this game have dated significantly since 2001. It is still enjoyable none the less however for those gamers who play the new shiny 1080p games, then this may be a struggle for you. Like all Half-Life games, a lot of thought has gone into the level design especially in the old areas of Black Mesa, where the equipment, hallways and signs have new textures. Notable were the health and HEV suit chargers, as there was an obvious change in their design to suit the old run down areas of the facility.\n\nThis game was a short but sweet expansion pack, only taking me 4 hours to complete. Like Opposing Force, there were no new “stand-out” soundtracks, those from Half-Life were once again recycled. However, it was fun to see the Lambda incident through the eyes of Barney Calhoun. Venturing into the old areas of Black Mesa was a unique experience, the gameplay was solid and it was interesting working with Dr Rosenberg as this companionship had not been done yet in a Half-Life game.\n\n7/10","November 11, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In Blue Shift, you are playing as Gordon's friend Barney Calhoun, instead of Gordon himself. The game starts off with you on a train in the Black Mesa Transit System just like Gordon. After listening to that annoying, 5 minute automated message, you arrive at your station and set off into the labs. However, just as you were beginning to become relaxed, the Resonance Cascade begins and everything goes down hill from there as you are forced to fight for your life and escape the Black Mesa Facility.","March 21, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/130/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Half Life Blue Shift is an expansion pack that takes place during the events of the first Half Life. This time around we play as a security guard called Barney Calhoun. He is mute and plays exactly the same as our last protagonist Gordon. If it wasn't for people calling you by your name you would have no clue you are supposed to be a completely different character.  The same goes for the levels, enemies and weapons. There is zero new enemies or weapons, in fact there are less weapons in this game. Levels themselves are very much like base Half Life, nothing special but definitely of the quality same quality and takes a bigger focus on action. A slight nick-pick I have is that the melee weapon is still a crowbar like the engineer Gordon  instead of a baton that would be far more suited toward a security officer.\n\nThe first thing you will notice starting up the game is that the user interface is now blue instead of orange like the main game. It is probably done to remind you that you are a security officer but has no other effects. The main change is that you no longer refill your “armor” via the wall mounted H.E.V system since you do not have that suit. Instead you scavenge around for usable security armor sets to refill your armor count. One big difference is that unlike the main game this now has a few unique npcs with their own personalities and motives instead of the original's endless army of generic clone npcs. You will also catch a few glimpses of Gordon Freeman from time to time but will never interact with him.\n\nBlue Shift is an expansion pack that plays it very close to home. It has very few changes from the base game and adds nothing new other than a few characters. This is a pretty safe dlc to skip as nothing very important happens story wise. It is more of a four hour adventure for those seeking more of that Half Life experience. In that regard it is a pretty solid dlc if you do not mind the lack of anything new to see. So if you fit that description you will find your fix here but for everyone else this is a by the books dlc that can easily be passed on if you had your fill of Half Life with the base game.","May 20, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recommend everyone plays this first after Half-Life and before Opposing Force for various reasons I will explain. The ratings and my feelings of this expansion are gauged in relation to the first Half-Life.\n\nSTORY: 9/10\nYou play as Barney Calhoun, security guard. You are actually the security guard you see banging on the door at the very beginning of Half-Life, pretty cool how it's all linked. You experience the events of the resonance cascade but at different parts of the facility. Your main goal is to escape with the scientists. The story actually isn't bad, but it ends kind of abruptly and feels like there should have been a little more.\n\nGRAPHICS: 9/10\nThese are the same graphics as the original Half-Life which is both good and bad. The good part is it all looks the same and this expansion came with an HD pack for all the original Half-Life games. The bad part is that when this game came out in 2001 the graphics were starting to look dated even for the time. This isn't a big deal to me as I enjoy the graphics (with the HD pack).\n\nSOUND: 9/10\nThe sound is the same as Half-Life. Not changing the alien sounds is fine, but I would've liked some new voices for the guards and scientists. Although there is a new voice for a certain scientist, that's it.\n\nWEAPONS: 8/10\nThe weapon system works the same as Half-Life but you get a fewer selection of weapons to play with and no new ones. This is very disappointing.\n\nENEMIES: 9/10\nYou see a return of nearly all of the enemies from Half-Life, but that's it. There is nothing new which is again disappointing.\n\nLEVEL DESIGN: 10/10\nThis is the only part where this game lives up to Half-Life. The level design is very similar and the few puzzles and situations where you must figure out what to do are very fun. And you get to revisit my favorite level!\n\nLENGTH AND REPLAYABILITY\nThis game is extremely short, clocking in at 2 hours, 2 and a half if you play on hard and take your time like I did. Still, it is fun to play as Barney and re-experiencing the levels in a future playthrough is certainly viable.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 9/10\nThe game is good and well made, but rushed and without any real new content. You should play this before Opposing Force because if you play it after you will be disappointed expecting this to at least be on the level of content of Opposing Force. If you liked Half-Life, this is still a must play.","October 25, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This expansion pack brings us to new areas of Black Mesa, unseen in previous games and there are a few Gordon Freeman cameos throughout.\n\nWhat made Opposing Forces’ gameplay so much fun and memorable was the fact that Gearbox introduced new weapons and enemies. Unfortunately, in Blue Shift, all the weapons and enemies were recycled from Half-Life. Dr Rosenberg’s companionship was a new gameplay aspect introduced in Blue shift. Unlike other scientist in Half-Life, who only have 4 character models, Dr Rosenberg has distinctive facial features and is an essential character who makes multiple appearances throughout the game. As well as this new feature, you can look forward to the return of fun but difficult puzzles and awesome shootouts against aliens and soldiers.\n\nLike Opposing Force, the graphics in this game have dated significantly since 2001. It is still enjoyable none the less however for those gamers who play the new shiny 1080p games, then this may be a struggle for you. Like all Half-Life games, a lot of thought has gone into the level design especially in the old areas of Black Mesa, where the equipment, hallways and signs have new textures. Notable were the health and HEV suit chargers, as there was an obvious change in their design to suit the old run down areas of the facility.\n\nThis game was a short but sweet expansion pack, only taking me 4 hours to complete. Like Opposing Force, there were no new “stand-out” soundtracks, those from Half-Life were once again recycled. However, it was fun to see the Lambda incident through the eyes of Barney Calhoun. Venturing into the old areas of Black Mesa was a unique experience, the gameplay was solid and it was interesting working with Dr Rosenberg as this companionship had not been done yet in a Half-Life game.\n\n7/10","November 11, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Good variety of puzzles with clever solutions.\n\nI won't say too much about the quality of the graphics and sound, it's an old game after all.\n\nThis is a pretty short game, but if you liked the original half-life, then you might as well get this to play.

I disagree, this is a great game. It's the original Half-Life from Barney Calouhn's perspective, and Gordon Freeman makes a couple cameos too! The story is just as interesting, the gameplay just as enjoyable, the graphics still hold up fourteen years later, and it's cheap (During the holidays it's 2 dollars, and 5 the rest of the year). One thing that might be a problem is it's length, only six chapters. But if that doesn't bother you then Half-Life: Blue Shift will be a blast. This is obviously the most underrated Half-Life game/ expansion.","December 26, 2014","true","42.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This time you portray Barney Calhoun, the same security guard who aided Gordon Freeman & Colporal Adrien Shepard during their survival of the Black Mesa incident. The game start off the same way as the original Half-Life game did within the monerail tram except Barney takes a different tram that show cases locations not shown in Half Life original or Opposing Force. After playing this game you get the idea of how massive the lab facility is. Anyways Barney is an everyday security guard who is about to part take his duty at Black Mesa, upon entering an elevator with a couple scientists, the power goes out and the elevator decends to the lower basement level at a high speed. Upon awakening, Barney wasn't sure how he survived the impact of the elevator fall, but soon he finds out that the lab facility is infested with hidious aliens that want Barney for dead. Upon scavenging armor and weapons, Barney must use his wit and what his training lessons taught him in order to escape Black Mesa in one piece. The scenario is the same as the original & Opposing Force games, except focused on a different character who embarks in different locations of the Black Mesa facility. The game play is similar along with the same minor flaws featured in the other games. Because Barney wears regular swat armor, he can not use the HEV units to regain armor strength instead he must obtain new armor in order to replace the old worn out armor. The enemies are the same and the weapons are the same as the ones used by Freeman & Shepard, but a much different experience. The length of the game is shorter but if you enjoyed playing the previous games, then this game is worth your time as it expands on what happened during the Black Mesa incident along with brief cameos of Freeman & the mysterious G-Man. Highly recommended for die hard Half-Life fans.","March 1","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Decay doesn't count and Black Mesa is a remake of the original Half-Life) You play as Barney Calhoun, a security guard who is trying to survive the events of Black Mesa (See Half-Life & HL: Opposing Force). Personally, I find this game the weakest of all the Half-Life games.\nPros:\n-Great to introduce Barney Calhoun as you'll meet him later in Half-Life 2\n-Same pros as Half-Life (Great gameplay, great level detail, etc.)\n\nCons:\n-Same weapons used by the great Gordon Freeman (Crowbar and everything) no new weapons like Opposing Force\n-Relatively boring story\n-Rarely any new enemies unlike Opposing Force\n-No Half-Life 3\n\nOverall, this game is OK its not the best Half-Life game. I recommend this game if your a BIG Half-Life fan, or you want to learn more about Barney before the events of Half-Life 2. However, there is really nothing else to it. I felt that Gearbox could've done a better job with this expansion (See my review of Opposing Force to see what Gearbox can really do).","May 9, 2015","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Developed by Gearbox and overseen by Valve. Blue Shift is definitely weaker than Opposing Force in terms of pretty much everything. That does not mean it is bad, the game just refuses to take risks or add anything new. You play as Black Mesa security officer Barney Calhoun, who is in the middle of his shift when the Resonance Cascade happens, he then has to find a way to escape Black Mesa. The gameplay is the same as the original Half-Life, but with no fun new enemies or weapons like in Opposing Force. But I still recommend the game because it reveals more of the story of Half-Life, and it is always fun to see a game's story line from a different perspective.\nTLDR: The weaker of the two expansions for Half-Life becuase it does not take risks or attempt anything new. Still keeps the fun gameplay, and it is cool to see the Black Mesa Incident from a different perspective.","May 24","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Basically, in Blue Shift, your goal is to escape. Barry meets up with various scientists until he finds Dr. Rosenberg who tasks him with setting up a teleportation machine to escape outside of main Black Mesa compound, other scientists are with Rosenberg as well. The story is rather short, about 2 hours to beat if you bum rush it and play on easy, which is what I did. But it was still fun as it expands on the Half Life universe and you get to hear other characters talk about Freeman and even Shepard, the guy from Opposing Force.\n\nGraphically and technically, Blue Shift has not aged well. The textures are pretty terrible and Barry slides like crazy after letting go of "w". It's kind of annoying. I can't blame the devs for the textures though, the game is rather old. But the wasd controls are so clunky. At least the level designs were still great.\n\nPretty good game, super short story though.

You play as Barney Calhoun on a normal day to work at the Black Mesa Reasearch facility, but crap goes wrong and just like Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force, you have to fight aliens from the planet Xen. The game is good so I'll put that there, and you just fight off aliens and squads of stupid NPC Marines trying to kill you of course. The gameplay is not too bad, but the annoying part of the game is that if you use Windows Vista or 7, you may be prone to more game problems and crashes due to the fact the game was not optimized for newer operating systems. You use Windows 8, well you probably don't because the game probably doesn't work for 8. I recommend you use an older machine with Windows 2000 at the highest because this game is pretty old, even for XP. If you do use a older machine, like a Windows 2000 machine to play it you might want to make sure you meet the system requirements so you are not angered by the fact your 2000 OS machine sucks ♥♥♥.

In Half Life: Blue Shift we play as Barney Calhoun who works as a security guard  at Black Mesa. The alien and soldier attack happens and we need to escape. So how is Half Life: Blue Shift ? Well I wish there was a mediocre button cause this game ain't bad, but it isn't good either. Compared to Opposing Force this adds nothing to the original game. No new weapons, horrible level design and incredibly short. This expansion  is really nothing special and it pains me to say that. The gameplay isn't even fun this time as this time it revolves around jumping puzzles and not so much around gun fights. This expansion is also really easy compared to Half Life as there is no threat standing in your way. The game is still fun enough for you to finish it but it is very disappointing. Overall there is not much to say about Half Life: Blue Shift. It's not a bad game but it's not good compared to Opposing Force and Half Life. If you want to finish the entire series than by all means pick it up, but if not than wait for a sale or skip this entirely.  I give Half Life: Blue Shift a 6/10","June 3, 2015","true","3.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I'll vote the game down. Why? Because if one buys the Anthology, he won't care about this at all. But if someone checks the individual games, maybe gets a little look into the game, and I hope that can understand this. To be really short: game is too short, quite shallow, less guns, less varied environments - nowhere as good as HL or Opposing Forces.\n\nHL Blue Shift currently stands at 90% positive reviews, while HL and Opposing Forces if I remember well has 96% and 95%  positives, and I have to agree with the trend - the game was fine, but not even as good as HL (This is my third, final review of the anthology - in my book Opposing Forces > Half-Life > Blue Shift, simply based amount the fun I had while playing)\nThe game features a really awesome physics based puzzle (barrels in coolant), had a fun part shooting gas cannisters' top to make them shoot at a door, and a barrel-detonator puzzle  which is really questionable in my opinion.\nOtherwise this game feels like a well-written, longer trailer for Half-Life. Alien contact's majority are headcrabs, there are maybe two Alien Grunts and Masters - the enemy variety could have been better from the gameplay aspect - the lack of stronger enemies really felt like the protagonist is away from the bigger happenings, making him feel like an underdog.\nThe gametime is about 3-4 hours, and the highs of it are the various little physics puzzles,  but other than that this game is everything but memorable.  We have less weapons than in the base game - Glock, Colt, machine gun, shotgun, rocket launcher, granade and satchel charge. (Plus Snarks, based on wiki) It's about the half of the arsenal we had in the base game or in Opposing Forces - this, with the short campaign makes this game nowhere as fun as the other titles were.","January 5","false","6.1"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","1"

While it is actually smaller, both in scope and features the scope makes sense. You play as Barney Calhoun, a member of the Blue shift ..i.e the security force of Black mesa. Yup That's you.\n\nThe events run parallel to to the story of Half Life and Opposing FOrce though Mr. Calhoun has the distinction of the three which you might already be able to guess at.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* Well Done Areas\n* Short Play Time\n* High CHallenge\n\nYOu'd think SHort Playtime would be a bad thing but honestly it works to the advantage of the game. Much like Portal it's juuus long enough to be fun but not so long that the areas start to drag on or feel padded. The challenge is ramped up due to the simple fact that barney has limited armor... no HEV, PCV charging or energy packs for you... just whatever you can strip off the corpses of your comrades. It adds a layer of tension.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* Fewer Weapons\n\nThis is about the only con and it makes sense.Barney is conf9ned to the more mundane weaponry.... but again this feels right.\n\nAll in all a great addition that does better than opposing force at expanding. opposing Force while good suffered from trying too hard .. Blue Shift is confident enought in what it offers that it doesn't need to throw much in.","October 20, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unbreakablezeta/recommended/130/","unbreakablezeta","Zeta Zaku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unbreakablezeta/","262 products in account","If you liked the original Half Life, you will probably like this too. It's essentially the same, aside from showing the origin of Valve (so many valves you need to turn).\n\nThis time the story is told from a guard's POV. Man, if only the other guards were as useful as Calhoun, the first Half Life would have been so much better!  Just like Freeman, Calhoun started his ordinary day at his job, until the incident happened. Being that Calhoun was a guard and experienced shooter, Blue Shift is more believeable than the original Half Life where a scientist becomes Rambo.\n\nGameplay and visuals are the same since it's using the same engine. Unlike Half Life, it wasn't too heavy on the platforming, but that's probably because the game is really short. While I wasn't trying to break Half LIfe, I never encountered any problems with enemy AI. In Blue Shift, enemy AI was really terrible at times. At one point where you're locked in a truck with the scientist, they kept throwing grenades at the locked door and killed themselves. Another time I flanked them and they just froze and didn't register me at all after shooting them. Guess it isn't as polished as Half Life.\n\nNPCs are once again a chore. When I was escorting the scientist to the lab, he kept stopping and complaining that he's tired. The first time he did that was back in the truck. He didn't even leave the truck and he complained about beeing exhausted.\n\nOverall, the game was too short to stand out too much, and most of the gameplay was too similar to Half Life.

For one reason or another, I never did. I never thought Id ever revisit the original Half-Life series and never get round to playing Blue-Shift.\nA bit of free time and a steam sale later, I found myself buying all 3 for £2,74. A bargain!\nAnyway, I played through Half Life, Opposing Force and then finally Blue Shift, all in the space of about 4/5days.\nBlue shift is a good game, it is Half-life, but after playing Opposing Force, it just seems like they wern't even trying with this one. It was short, too easy, no new enemies, no new gameplay mechaics, nothing of interest really, it didnt even have a boss/final fight. Im glad in only cost me pence, if I had bought it back in the day I think Id have been really disappointed. I played a lot of Mods on myy original, many of which were better than this official expansion.\n\nPlay the game, its worth 99p, but dont expect too much.\n\n(Anybody know what the zombie game was called and the western, both got released on CD i believe with some magazine.)","June 24, 2015","false","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I can't say the same, since every 5 minutes has a new game breaking bug.

Third - at long ranges enemy AI kind of spazzes out and often completely ignores the player, even if the player shoots them, which is very evident at some of the latest stages in the game. Fourth - there is less enemy and weapon variety than even in the original game, and there is nothing added in the previous expansion pack, Opposing Force.\n\nBut ultimately it all doesn't matter, since you've probably already got it for dirt cheap as a part of Half-Life or Valve bundle and never gonna play it anyway :)","February 7","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the previous games security officers were dead all over and seemed weak without the HEV suit or it's military version. Blue Shift is also really small, sadly, with about 4 to 5 hours of gameplay.

There's no new weapons (even less than HL1 for that matter), very few, if any, memorable set pieces, a handful of easy puzzles, lazy enemy encounters, and the whole experience in general just feels like it's going through the motions.\n\nIt feels as if it was incomplete, not just because it's incredibly short either, but also because there's no real climax throughout the entire campaign! While Opposing Force was shorter than Half-Life, the tension was constantly rising until it was noticeably more difficult than HL1 ever became. Furthermore, OF introduced many new weapons and (somewhat finnicky) mechanics! You'd think if Blue Shift had nothing new to offer, they'd at least grab everything that made the original so great and go out with a bang, but sadly instead it goes out with a whimper.\n\nShame really, the High Definition patch (circa 2000 standards) is nifty, but I can't say I would recommend going back and playing this one.","November 29, 2012","false","2.5"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

The game is disappointingly short, lacks any serious challenge, interesting weapons, or new enemies. The story is also pretty lack luster. You play as Barney, the security guard you see pounding on the door in the intro to Half-Life, who is later used as a side character in Half-Life 2. The G-Man plays no serious role in the game, unlike his direct involvement in the endings of Half-Life, or Opposing Force. The ending (spoiler alert) falls completely flat. Get teleported to a parking lot, then drive away. No enemies, no hurry, no stress, no reward. Huzzah, right? I want to like this game, but I don't. Gearbox and Valve got really lazy. Your money is better spent on Opposing Force, about 10 new guns, about 5 new enemeis, new bosses, a pretty decent story, and an interesting new perspective.

Do not do what I am assuming. This game is way less fun and shorter than Half-Life or Opposing Force. That being said, it is not a bad idea to buy the Half-Life 1 Anthology, because that includes Blue Shift and Team Fortress Classic for the combined price of Half-Life and Opposing Force when not in a bundle. If you were looking for a Half-Life experience, but don't want to buy the Half-Life 1 Anthology, then buy Opposing Force because that expansion lasts a lot longer (6 hours to beat Opposing Force, while only 2.5 hours to beat Blue Shift) and has cooler weapons.

It plays much the same as the original, the weapons and enemies remain unchanged and the maps will feel eerily familiar as you battle through the corridors of Black Mesa.\n\nThe game just doesn't do anything new, it's feels almost like a recycled game, like you did all this before only it was fun the first time around. Thankfully the game is extremely short so your pain won't last long and you can safely uninstall this and go back the playing the various superior mods for Half-Life, both single- and multi-player.\n\nPerhaps the only redeeming quality is the high definition models pack that comes bundled with Blue Shift that gives the game a little a extra. However it should be noted that Half-Life can look much prettier than even that, you just have to play maps and mods that weren't made by Valve.","November 13, 2012","false","17.6"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

Widower Barney, who still mourns the death of his wife Chell, is having problems changing the beneficiary on his insurance policy from Chell's name to his children's.  He is worried about his children's future if he were to be killed in the line of duty, and is contemplating quitting his job for something less risky, but he also does not want to forfeit his Black Mesa pension as he also see it as a safety net for his children.  Barney saves Rosenberg's life during the Black Mesa incident.  So when Rosenberg tells Barney that he owes him one, Barney takes him up on his offer.  Barney's favor: despite both being heterosexual, that they enter into a domestic partnership, in name and paper only, to provide that much needed protection for Barney's children.  Chronic womanizer Rosenborg reluctantly but eventually agrees.  The one person who knows for a certainty that they are both straight is their boss, G-Man.  Their plan hits a snag when Barney believes that they are being investigated by the pension department for possible fraud, which means that Rosenberg has to move in with him and his kids.  They consult the advice of a vortigaunt who adds an extra layer of complexity to the situation as Rosenberg in particular is attracted to aliens and believes it could be the one and only for him.  The vortigaunt's advice coupled with it wanting Rosenberg to be it's new best friend makes it even harder on him.\n\nMuch like man with dwarfism, this game is short.  Also remind me of not so good Adam Sandler films.  Very sneeky.","April 2, 2015","false","5.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","3","9","3","0"

This is the other spin-off game that Gearbox made from the original Half-Life. This time, you play as one of the security guards at Black Mesa: specifically Barney Calhoun, whom you meet and shoot people with in Half-Life 2. So here's his story about how he managed to get out of there alive.\n\nThe only real new thing is that since Barney wears "body armor" and not "power armor", you get your armor upgrades via scraps on the ground rather than the energy charger cells or those charger stations on the walls. Beyond that, there's little to nothing new here. The number of weapons is the smallest of any Half-Life game, and there are none that are new. You are pretty much exclusively using "conventional" weapons like pistols, shotguns, and grenades.\n\nThis is also even shorter than Opposing Force. Took me 2.5 hours without ever having played this before. That's... rather sad.\n\nAnyway, this one gets a no vote from me. It has even less stuff than the game it's based off of, and doesn't have any cool new elements like Opposing Force did. I guess play it if you are *really* interested in finding out how Barney got out of Black Mesa, but beyond that... this isn't really worth it.","March 7, 2014","false","2.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","4"

It's a Half-Life game after all."\n\nI was so, so wrong.\n\nI'll start with the length - 2 hours and 40 minutes of gameplay. Ok, not bad for a expansion pack. Shame that Opposing Force is a lot longer and costs the same amount of money.\n\nEnemies jumping out at you are too predictable. They are more of a obstacle than a challenge here.\n\nWhen I enter a new area I think: "Why am I here?" or "What's the point of this?" instead of "Wow, this is really cool."\n\nThen there's the difficulty and health management - or rather the lack of it. Here, I run around with 100 hp and 50 armour on my first playthrough and 50%-100% ammo to all guns instead of the usual, average 70% health and no armour and striving to find more ammo. Here, Ammunition is just there for the sake od it. It's not a life-saver like in the original game. Same applies to health & armour stations/kits.\n\nThe Hazard Course is not new. They literally took the identical thing from Half-Life and replaced the hologram. Where you originally first see a HEV charger, the pedastal with the arrow is still there as if they didn't even bother removing it.\n\nThe only actually interesting thing is the level design of some stages, especially the Xen chapter, which is really cool, and you get to see new stuff.\n\nOh, I almost forgot.

It's really not worth it. The game tries little to nothing new or interesting. The story is about one of the security guards of Black Mesa, Barney Calhoun. If you've played Half Life 2, you probably remember the opening where a combine soldier takes you to an enclosed room and reveals to Gordon Freeman that he is one of your best friends. Ok, but that raises the question. If Barney is friends with Gordon then how come you only see Gordon Freeman in Blue Shift once or twice?\nThe gameplay is exactly the same as the original Half-Life. The only difference is that you have fewer weapons than you did in Half-Life 1 and they're all typical weapons that you would find in virtually any FPS ever made and no interesting and or exotic weapons at all; assault rifle, shot gun, pistol, revolver, grenade, satchel charge, rocket launcher, and the  crowbar that was in the original Half-Life game. Oh, and let's not forget that you can't use HEV chargers to charge your armor and can make you take less damage, even though they're all over the game.\nThe enemies are the exact same ones as in the original Half-Life. There are no new ones at all.\nThere is a glitch in the game that made me pull every strand of hair out of my scalp. Right before the residence cascade from HL1, you have to enter an elevator with 2 scientists. Right before the residence cascade, the 2 scientists explode and you have to start over from the last checkpoint and you will go through that glitch again and again, until you start the entire game over.\nOverrall, this game is not one of the worst game ever, it's just not worth buying. I guess the only redeemable part about this game is the HD pack, which improves the textures, character models, and switches some of the weapon designs to the models from the PS2 port.","December 13, 2013","false","7.8"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

This game really doesn't add anything new other than the story. There's no new enemies, no new weapons, just a new scientist model and that's it. The only security guards that you meet are at the beginning of the game and you won't find any to help you later on.\n\nYou don't get any of the new weapons from the previous expansion Opposing Force, you don't even obtain all the weapons from the original Half-Life. The game is incredibly short and there is no end boss like in the previous two games. This whole game can be finished in less than 3 hours.\n\nOverall, it's not worth getting Blue Shift other than for the story. If you're choosing between getting this and OpFor then get OpFor, it has much more content.","February 24","false","10.0"," 1 of 14 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","1","14","0","0"

Half-life Blue Shift was visually impressive and had some cool scripting when it came out. Besides that though, it's largely a dissapointment. It's not that the game isn't fun, or doesn't have it's moments-it does- but it doesn't fill the standard that Half-life and HL:OpFor set. Besides the overall game time and plot both being lacking, it also shoots itself in the foot by not including as many weapons or enemies. Only about half the arsenal is included (no energy weapons, missing a couple explosives, and no Xen/Race X weapons). While I don't fault this game for leaving out the Race X creatures, I DO MISS the Xen creatures (and human enemies) that fail to show up. You don't get to fight any mutated zombies (OpFor), Icthysaurs (underwater things), boss enemies, black ops or assassins, and you only fight a handful of grunts and the flying mini-Nihilanth things. The game is still enjoyable, but it's not highly recommendable.  If you're a HL fan or just craving a decent shooter however, perhaps this may appease you. 6/10","February 6, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I first played half life 2, I was disapointed because it was so different from the original (though dont get me wrong, still a great game.) That being said, Half Life Blue Shift and Opposing Forces are great games because they take place at the same time as thr original and are that same original style and setting. In Blue Shift you play as the security gaurd Barney Calhoun, working your way through Black Mesa, and fighting against aliens and the marines. You see things that you didn't see as Gordon Freeman, which is exciting. So even though it took place at the same time as Half Life, it is still its own game. It is very short but if you loved half life you have to get this game. I highly recommend it, but I would also point out that Opposing Forces was significantly more fun than Blue Shift.","January 9, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He revealed himself and I thought "... who exactly are you? Are you an enemy or not?" Then I remember this game, Blue Shift. I remembered reading about this game and the character it spawned, so I paused HL2 for the moment and purchased Blue Shift. It was... decent to say the least. I think taking a character who didn't have a lick of screen time/potential story and making him the main character of his own spinoff is pretty hilarious. In a good way I might add. This game, however had a few really annoying glitches that almost ruined some aspects of the game for me. Everytime I would load after a death, the gun/weapon I was holding wouldn't stop shooting/attacking. While playing on hard mode, where I need every tiny bit of ammo I can get, made this much worse. Something I really love about this game was seeing Gordon at those random parts, those made the whole thing worth while. All and all, I really only recommend this game to fans of Half Life, if nothing else but to experience Barney's adventure.","December 31, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Blue Shift follows Barney Calhoun, a mere security guard in the Black Mesa facility; and his only goal is to escape, but between aliens killing everyone and HECU soldiers trying to cover up the incident(also by killing everyone), that's not an easy goal.\n\nEveryone will tell you that Opposing Force is the better Half Life expansion, but it's not in my opinion. Me, I prefer lore based games rather than challenge based games, and that's what Blue Shift is. While everone says Opossing Force is better because it has new enemies and weapons, it follows an HECU soldier, which in Half Life are enemies. It's nice to see a different side of the soldiers, and find that maybe they're not all ruthless killers, but it's harder to care about them after having killed dozens of them in Half Life.\n\nBlue Shift, however, may have the same enemies and weapons from Half Life but it tells a story more people want to hear. In HL2, you see Barney again, but those who haven't played Blue Shift will be asking "Hey, how did Barney escape Black Mesa?". Now, after playing this expansion, you will know a story that actually will matter later on because Barney actually returns in the franchise. You never hear from Adrain Shephard again, and because of this Blue Shift seems like an expansion that actually gives you knowledge that helps you understand how Barney got out that day.\n\nNow, Opposing Force is fun as hell too, and you should really play both, but if you prefer an expansion that deals with more lore/story based issues rather than focuses on challenge, than you'll likely prefer Blue Shift.","August 30, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You see, Blue Shift is actually quite good, remaining synonymous with Half-Life, as far as core gameplay goes. That's just the thing, however -  in essence, this game is virtually part of Half-Life 1 reskinned with less weapons, less story, no significant substance added to the Half-Life universe, and only 6 hours max of gameplay in total. While worth the money, and technically in no way bad per se, compared to the original Half-Life, this game just falls short.\n\nBut I'm not here to compare this game to HL1, am I? Nope, I'm here to tell you whether or not you should buy this game. So, I'll say this: if you felt that you couldn't get enough of the first Half-Life, then you won't regret purchasing this, the equivalent of a level pack, for five dollars, to get six more hours of Half-Life.

But unlike Opposing Force, Valve decided on the story so we won't get any BS Race-X aliens. Anyway, this Side Story lets you play as Barney Calhoun. (The REAL one.)\n\nHowever, Unlike Gordon and Commander Shepard, G-Man doesn't do a damn thing and You're on your own for this one. So yes, this is the ONLY time in the Half Life series (As of this review) where you work for a happy ending and you GET a happy ending. (Until HL2, that is.)\n\nThe weapons that you can use are way and i mean WAY fewer than HL or HL:OF BUT, with the console you can access HL's Weapon list.\n\nIf you wanted to know Blue Shift's Weapons: (Crowbar, 9MM, Revolver, Shotgun, Rawket Lawnchair, Satchel Charge, Hand Grenade and the Snarks.)\n\nNot as much as Opposing Force, but let's be honest: We are only going to use the shotgun, aren't we?\n\nIn all, if you wanted to have a quick stroll and look back through time to Black Mesa without the Slog-Fest of Opposing Force or don't want to go through the un-holy mess that is HL's Xen, I would go for this game.\n\nFor PC and Sega Dreamcast, It's Half Life: Blue Shift released in June 12, 2001!\n\nPS: this game does NOT have the "ACTION PACKED AMURRIKIA SAVES THE DAY BY KILLIN ALURRENS" or the "WHAT HAS SCIENCE DONE?!?!?!?!?" style that the other two games have.

This time it only has single-player campaign, there is no multiplayer component. If you want to play some Deathmatch, you should better head toward HL1. It also came with HD models bundled in Retail, and so in Steam version too.\n\nNow, the single player campaign is quite short and doesn't include any kind of new features, whetever weapons or enemeis. And that may dissapoint you when compared to first expansion pack. The reason for it being this way - it wasn't made to be a full expansion pack. Instead, it's origin was to be a bonus content for Dreamcast version of HL1. Shame that it was cancelled when it was almost done. So, not to lose work that been done, Gearbox released it for PC serapately. Another thing you might notice is that it reuses Opposing Force (the first expansion pack) soundtrack\n\nIn this campaign you are Barney Calhoun, the random security guard, who owes Gordon a beer. And unlike every other security guards, he actually passed advanced movement training and can navigate doorways just fine. And stairs. And vents. And shoots many crabs. And he is no hero and his only wish is not to stop alien invasion, but just to get the hell out of here. Ok, he, like a proper hero, has to get the surviving personel out of facility into outside safety.  So, you are back into usual Half-Life busyness, shooting, solving "puzzles" and exlporing levels, with fair share of plot conversations with scienists. All while getting to use realistical only weapons (no Gauss Gun fun), with ammo somewhat limited for each one.There is no real climax final boss, the ending seem to be a bunch of strange teasers, so to say. Otherwise it should be pleasent and make sense. I could say, it's the least repetive experience compared to HL1 and OpForce, maybe it just ends before it gets stale.\n\nBut yes, it would have made nice bonus content for Dreamcast, but lacking expansion pack. At least it came packing with HD models and Opposing Force on retail in some regions. Some even say that it contains leftover Dreamcast version codes inside cue some dissapearing corpses. Though, HL1 and OpposingForce on Steam had them as well, strange. Another strange thing is that none the soldiers here ever threw normal grenades at me, they would just place down grenade and run when heavily wounded. And most curiously, it uses soundtrack of Opposing Force... Which doesn't feel right. Cheerful military drumbs beat when the security guard falls to his demise due to two zombies? As looking at the footage of Dreamcast version (it leaked to Internet, yes) it's supposed to use Half-Life soundtrack instead.","August 8, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game stars Barney Calhoun, the generic security guard. The content is not so new, though it boasted the HD pack while release. The Steam edition has it for owners of the game. Most content is taken straight from the original Half Life, making the graphics kind of dated. Only a few parts have all new content such as certain signs and objects introduced for the game. A new character is in the game, playing the role of a scientist. Enemies and guns are limited, with no super cool weapons that the first or second games had. The gametime is short, clocking in at 4 hours compared to HL's 11 and Op's 6 hours. The levels are nicely designed though they borrow heavily from the Half Life kind of levels with a systematic apparoach to the chapters. While the game has small bursts of ingenuity and fun ideas, it is not so original. That being said, this game is good for fans of Half Life looking for a quick HL game.","October 1, 2011","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Blue Shift follows Barney Calhoun, a mere security guard in the Black Mesa facility; and his only goal is to escape, but between aliens killing everyone and HECU soldiers trying to cover up the incident(also by killing everyone), that's not an easy goal.\n\nEveryone will tell you that Opposing Force is the better Half Life expansion, but it's not in my opinion. Me, I prefer lore based games rather than challenge based games, and that's what Blue Shift is. While everone says Opossing Force is better because it has new enemies and weapons, it follows an HECU soldier, which in Half Life are enemies. It's nice to see a different side of the soldiers, and find that maybe they're not all ruthless killers, but it's harder to care about them after having killed dozens of them in Half Life.\n\nBlue Shift, however, may have the same enemies and weapons from Half Life but it tells a story more people want to hear. In HL2, you see Barney again, but those who haven't played Blue Shift will be asking "Hey, how did Barney escape Black Mesa?". Now, after playing this expansion, you will know a story that actually will matter later on because Barney actually returns in the franchise. You never hear from Adrain Shephard again, and because of this Blue Shift seems like an expansion that actually gives you knowledge that helps you understand how Barney got out that day.\n\nNow, Opposing Force is fun as hell too, and you should really play both, but if you prefer an expansion that deals with more lore/story based issues rather than focuses on challenge, than you'll likely prefer Blue Shift.","August 30, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/130/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Blue Shift is a second and last expansion pack of Half-Life by Gearbox. This time it only has single-player campaign, there is no multiplayer component. If you want to play some Deathmatch, you should better head toward HL1. It also came with HD models bundled in Retail, and so in Steam version too.\n\nNow, the single player campaign is quite short and doesn't include any kind of new features, whetever weapons or enemeis. And that may dissapoint you when compared to first expansion pack. The reason for it being this way - it wasn't made to be a full expansion pack. Instead, it's origin was to be a bonus content for Dreamcast version of HL1. Shame that it was cancelled when it was almost done. So, not to lose work that been done, Gearbox released it for PC serapately. Another thing you might notice is that it reuses Opposing Force (the first expansion pack) soundtrack\n\nIn this campaign you are Barney Calhoun, the random security guard, who owes Gordon a beer. And unlike every other security guards, he actually passed advanced movement training and can navigate doorways just fine. And stairs. And vents. And shoots many crabs. And he is no hero and his only wish is not to stop alien invasion, but just to get the hell out of here. Ok, he, like a proper hero, has to get the surviving personel out of facility into outside safety.  So, you are back into usual Half-Life busyness, shooting, solving "puzzles" and exlporing levels, with fair share of plot conversations with scienists. All while getting to use realistical only weapons (no Gauss Gun fun), with ammo somewhat limited for each one.There is no real climax final boss, the ending seem to be a bunch of strange teasers, so to say. Otherwise it should be pleasent and make sense. I could say, it's the least repetive experience compared to HL1 and OpForce, maybe it just ends before it gets stale.\n\nBut yes, it would have made nice bonus content for Dreamcast, but lacking expansion pack. At least it came packing with HD models and Opposing Force on retail in some regions. Some even say that it contains leftover Dreamcast version codes inside cue some dissapearing corpses. Though, HL1 and OpposingForce on Steam had them as well, strange. Another strange thing is that none the soldiers here ever threw normal grenades at me, they would just place down grenade and run when heavily wounded. And most curiously, it uses soundtrack of Opposing Force... Which doesn't feel right. Cheerful military drumbs beat when the security guard falls to his demise due to two zombies? As looking at the footage of Dreamcast version (it leaked to Internet, yes) it's supposed to use Half-Life soundtrack instead.","August 8, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good news is ; the storytelling and setting is significantly improved.

After Playing through Blue Shift on Hard difficulty I have to say that I can understand the criticism this game got. But after all it was a really good ... little campaign. I think the points of criticism (no new Weapons, no Endboss, no new Enemies etc.) are valid considering the original Half Life and its quality. But surprisingly enough these points seemed very fiiting to me. I mean after all we arent the Hero of the story. We are nothing special at all. We are just a security officer that tries to get the hell out of the catastrophy he got into. Why should he use some super new Weapons ? He uses what he can find. Why should he beat a giant Alien or Endboss ? He is simply trying to get away, not trying to save the world (like Rosenberg pointed out during the Elevator Scene). Other than that I have to say that I found the atmosphere to be really amazing. I felt so much like a confused lonely surviver trying to stay alive running for his life. All these dark coridors and the environment crumbling away. Electricity shooting out of walls and stuff like that. The biggest personal point of criticism for me is that it only took me 4 hours to complete the campaign on the hardest difficulty. Ultimately, if you enjoy the Half Life Universe I can only recommend you to play it. Its short, its atmospheric, its intense.\n\n- Pudels","November 7, 2013","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game stars Barney Calhoun, the generic security guard. The content is not so new, though it boasted the HD pack while release. The Steam edition has it for owners of the game. Most content is taken straight from the original Half Life, making the graphics kind of dated. Only a few parts have all new content such as certain signs and objects introduced for the game. A new character is in the game, playing the role of a scientist. Enemies and guns are limited, with no super cool weapons that the first or second games had. The gametime is short, clocking in at 4 hours compared to HL's 11 and Op's 6 hours. The levels are nicely designed though they borrow heavily from the Half Life kind of levels with a systematic apparoach to the chapters. While the game has small bursts of ingenuity and fun ideas, it is not so original. That being said, this game is good for fans of Half Life looking for a quick HL game.","October 1, 2011","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

In a sense it's basically just more of the first Half-Life. Which is not a bad thing because that means all things that made half-life what it is, including the crouch jumping, crawling in vents and odd puzzles. Even after all this years it really holds well, and it's still a great entertainment.\n\nAlthough I kinda wish they would intertwine the story with original one to more degree and used opportunity to reveal more details from different perspective. Freeman is shown couple times, but wouldn't it be cool if you could sometimes see him running around, maybe accidentally helping you unlock a door or turn a power on (or off and make matters more difficult, that selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ :).\n\nAlso It's kinda strange that as an ordinary (but brave) guard you're basically doing the same things as Gordon, only you're expected to do it without H.E.V. suit. Another great thing to see would be a little more humane and humorous side to the Calhoun having the worst job day ever.\n\nBut I guess it's easy now to throw all this ideas writing it on 2013, gaming was different back then (but still has it's charm). To sum up great addition to Half Life series, but not required to play as it doesn't add much to the story.\n","January 15, 2013","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

It's really short, and compared to Opposing Force, which is pretty fantastic, Blue Shift really feels like a 3rd party mod (although I guess it was,[www.gearboxsoftware.com]heh). Something about the level design combined with the stock assets just makes a lot of the experience feel kind of meh. That's not to say it's all like that; it has a better ending than Opposing Force, and I would say the last part of the game as a whole is quite engaging. I enjoyed a lot of my time with this game, I think, but I was bored a lot of the time too.

I'm still listing this as a reccomendation, but Blue Shift is obviously the lesser of the three Half Life campaigns. Granted, it's still more Half Life, and it's a new campaign from the perspective of Barney, the security guard from Half Life 2 back when he worked at black mesa, but while it isn't as exciting or adds as many new things as Opposing Force, there is another problem you may not be aware of which is that Blue Shift doesn't seem to have recieved as rigerous patching as Half Life 1 and Opposing Force have, and as a result it's a tad buggier, looks a tad worse and honestly does feel a few versions back.\n\nGranted, it IS still more Half Life and if you beat Half Life 1 and Opposing Force's Campaigns and feel like you need more then this is right up your alley but otherwise it might be best to steer clear unless you're getting this in a pack.","February 13, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, this review will be written with respect to Half-Life and Opposing Force, so there are spoilers ahead for those two.\n\nGameplay: Half-Life 1 had some interesting things, Opposing Force had the same interesting things but with even more interesting things. Blue Shift has less things in it than even Half-Life 1. Calling this an expansion pack is, to be quite frank, something of an insult to Opposing Force. You don't even get all of the human arsenal, let alone ANY the alien arsenal. Enemy design has gone back as well; you fight a total of six different types of enemies throughout this "expansion" pack. There aren't even any bosses!  Level design is... well, it's alright. Nothing too impressive, but nothing really worth slandering. The big kicker is the fact that I beat it in just over two hours, not even dying once on Normal Mode (apart from a not so good platforming section). It feels like something of a fan project as opposed to the quite frankly stellar performance put forward in making Opposing Force. This was two years later, so there really was no excuse. 5/10.\n\nStory: Well, maybe the story makes up for it? Not really. You're a security guard, some things happen and you exit Black Mesa. No intrigue whatsoever; hell, the G-Man makes one appearance. That's it. Definitely another disappointment. 4/10.\n\nGraphics: Yet another step back from Opposing Force. Even after just having beaten it, I'm struggling to remember anything about the Black Mesa complex's area design apart from the final "area" of the game. You go to Xen which is neat and all, but again; it just feels like more of the same. It's just as technically adept as Opposing Force, so I don't really have any complaints there. It's just that the area design feels so damn lackluster. 3/5.\n\nSound: There's a couple of songs for the OST which are relatively intense and used for all of ten seconds, leaving you feel kinda unfulfilled. Voice acting is just alright now that there's no G-Man, and the sound design is pretty much on the same level as Opposing Force. 3/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 5/4/3/3; cumulative score of 5.0/10. Out of the "main" Half-Life 1 series, play Half-Life 1 and Opposing Force. If you really wanna see what this one is about, just watch a speedrun. It'll save you an hour and a half and about $5. Really, really lackluster.","March 18, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I first played half life 2, I was disapointed because it was so different from the original (though dont get me wrong, still a great game.) That being said, Half Life Blue Shift and Opposing Forces are great games because they take place at the same time as thr original and are that same original style and setting. In Blue Shift you play as the security gaurd Barney Calhoun, working your way through Black Mesa, and fighting against aliens and the marines. You see things that you didn't see as Gordon Freeman, which is exciting. So even though it took place at the same time as Half Life, it is still its own game. It is very short but if you loved half life you have to get this game. I highly recommend it, but I would also point out that Opposing Forces was significantly more fun than Blue Shift.","January 9, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysticTeaWolf/recommended/130/","MysticTeaWolf","Maximillian Strauss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysticTeaWolf/","807 products in account","Half-Life: Blue Shift is the second and final expansion for the original Half-Life and was developed by Gearbox Software (the same developers for the first expansion Opposing Force) and published by Valve. A fairly short but decent expansion which gives us yet another perspective to the entire Black Mesa Incident from a different character.\n\nThis time the player takes on the role of Barney Calhoun, a security officer employed at the Black Mesa Research Facility and the man who has helped Gordon Freeman out of so many sticky and difficult situations. The game starts out with Barney Calhoun carrying out his duties and then being caught up in the Black Mesa Incident which, like Opposing Force, cleverly coincides with the original Half-Life’s storyline.\n\nWhat Gearbox Software does well is maintaining the atmosphere and world of the original Half-Life while providing the experience through the eyes of someone else who was involved in the story of the original Half-Life. For me, Blue Shift felt like the final game in the Penumbra series (Penumbra: Requiem) as it ends the first Half-Life game’s storyline in a fairly chilled and relaxing way without forcing the player to battle an end boss whilst providing a few situations where a puzzle needs to be solved.\n\nThe core gameplay is the same as it is for Half-Life and Opposing Force with the weapons and other items not really changing which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The health system is also the same with some slight changes as those that were in Opposing Force. Since security officers do not wear HEV suits, they cannot make use of any HEV suit charger units that are located around the facility. Instead the player must pick up security officer issued body armour vests and helmets to replenish their armour protection. Something that I’ve noticed about Blue Shift is that you will find an enormous amount of first aid packs around each chapter and this makes the game less challenging. The player’s flashlight seems to have been designed differently with the way light is dispersed in dark places which felt a lot more realistic.\n\nStructurally, the game is chaptered like the previous games and provides a fun, linear storyline that will keep you engaged and wanting to find out more. Barney Calhoun does not encounter any of the alien creatures of Race X as Adrian Shepherd did in Opposing Force, but does encounter hostility from the marines and the traditional Xen alien creatures.\n\nOverall, there is not much more that could be said about Half-Life: Blue Shift. It provides a new and interesting perspective to the storyline which leaves a lot of questions and few answers. For those who want to return to the events of the Black Mesa Incident and see the situation unfold from a different viewpoint then I highly recommend Blue Shift.

After finishing it, I didn't find it as fun as I thought it would be but that's mostly because of bugs.  Now the bugs may actually be from the original Blue Shift, it may have came along with the steam port, or I'm simply too used to Valve's more recent games, but either way here are my complaints.\n\n- Pressing the use key "E" stops the player from moving, and pressing it repeatedly makes your character stutter.  If you miss grabbing an object and try to grab it again, you will stutter.\n- Pressing the use key on an object and pressing left or right launches the object at a high speed, sometimes dragging you along with it.\n- Whenever loading a saved game, attack is almost always on auto, so if you have a crowbard you'll keep swinging until you press attack again.  If you saved with your gun as your weapon, you'll autmatically be shooting when loaded.\n- Loading spots can sometimes be near an enemy, so if you're moving back and forth to shoot the enemy, you'll keep on loading and lagging.\n- Not necessarily a bug but there are some things that look like you can crouch jump onto but actually can't.\n\nWhen there are obstacles that involve moving objects around, it becomes kind of frustrating.  I guess the only directions you should use is just forwards and backwards when grabbing things.\n\nIf you can get past over these it's not a bad game, but not that interesting either.  I would recommend if you're interseted in another perspective on the Black Mesa incident.","June 20, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In a sense it's basically just more of the first Half-Life. Which is not a bad thing because that means all things that made half-life what it is, including the crouch jumping, crawling in vents and odd puzzles. Even after all this years it really holds well, and it's still a great entertainment.\n\nAlthough I kinda wish they would intertwine the story with original one to more degree and used opportunity to reveal more details from different perspective. Freeman is shown couple times, but wouldn't it be cool if you could sometimes see him running around, maybe accidentally helping you unlock a door or turn a power on (or off and make matters more difficult, that selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ :).\n\nAlso It's kinda strange that as an ordinary (but brave) guard you're basically doing the same things as Gordon, only you're expected to do it without H.E.V. suit. Another great thing to see would be a little more humane and humorous side to the Calhoun having the worst job day ever.\n\nBut I guess it's easy now to throw all this ideas writing it on 2013, gaming was different back then (but still has it's charm). To sum up great addition to Half Life series, but not required to play as it doesn't add much to the story.\n","January 15, 2013","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Its gameplay is solid; however its weakness lies with the enemy and weapon verity. For the majority of the game, you are fighting Vortigaunts and soldiers. You are primarily armed with a revolver, pistol, shotgun, automatic rifle, a bazooka for tough enemies, some explosives, and the trusty crowbar in hand.  Barney, the protagonist of this game, is not as well equipped as his counterparts, Gordon and Adrian. For that reason, he doesn’t fight that many strong enemies like Alien Grunts or even encounter the Black Ops. This expansion is also short; it only took me about two hours to complete it in a single run.  However, I enjoyed the level design a bit more because it eliminated a lot of awkward platforming which plagued Half-Life. It also doesn’t have an awkward final boss like the Nihilanth to round the game off which actively tried to break the flow of the game.\n\nOverall, after playing Half-Life, I believe this game is a weaker experience, but it has aged better than Half-Life in terms of level design. If you enjoy old school FPS games or want to familiarize yourself with them, you can’t go wrong with Half-Life: Blue Shift.","August 29, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In blue shift, you play as the security guard Barney Calhoun, who was present is the vanilla Half-Life, and the next games in the series. You see the story through his perspective, though the two games are rather similar. You get the same guns, same enemies same enviroments and similar challenges. In essence, this is basically a two-three hour version of Half-Life. It's definitely reccomended for the hardcore fans, but for anyone else it's hard to sell. You're paying for more Half-Life, and that's what you're getting. Blue Shift is kinda fun, but not neccesary to play in order to fully understand the story of the following games.\n\nTl;dr:\n\nIf you loved Half:Life and are craving for more gameplay that is very similar, buy it. If you're playing it for more story, progression of the main characters or variety in the set-in-stone Half-Life gameplay, Blue-Shift will dissapoint.

The structure is also very similar to HL: you come to work, ZOMFG! accident, aliens, then soldiers, then you're on the alien world, you come back, and mess about with teleports while obviously being had by scientists.\n\nI think this add-on completely missed out on developing the alternate view point. It did absolute *nothing* to show you the HL events from a point of view of a security guard. You were just like Freeman, trying to GTFO from Black Mesa!\n\nSurely an armed security guard at a secret advanced research facility has some sort of protocol for such events that happened? Even the titles that flash at the start say equipment is first priority, personell is secondary, and personal life is of low priority, yet the only thing you're meant to care in the game is your own life.\n\nA great way to spin this add-on would've been to follow just that recipe: first you try to save some equipment but then realize it's a hopeless and stupid thing to do; we have to evacuate people! Whoever you're helping however are gunned right and left by soldiers and at the end, you're forced to abandon your job ethics, abandon your morals, and fight for your own life.\n\nAfter the first 5 minutes of the game, the only thing different from this and original HL is that you can't use H.E.V. chargers. Pathetic. I'm only giving a recommendation for the sake of nostalgy.","June 12, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as Black Mesa security guard Barney Calhoun and it’s a parallel story with Half-Life but short. It’s not that good and I’ll explain why. If you remember from my previous review, Half-Life: Opposing Force featured a decent amount of new content for Half-Life. Now this game is like the opposite were there is no new weapons, NPCs, or weapons but instead just a new 90 to 120 minute campaign just slapped onto the original Half-Life game. However this game does feature the new HD pack, where it basically takes existing models, weapons, and weapon sounds and replaces them with newer, better looking ones. This addon also can be used with the original Half-Life and expansion Opposing Force but that’s really not a big deal for this review. I also noticed that the HD models have washed out looking textures on them for some reason compared to when using them in other Half-Life games. As for the gameplay and everything, it’s really the exact same game but with recycled textures and new maps for the single-player campaign (no multiplayer included). For 2001 this game was just bland by this point especially with titles like Halo hitting the XBOX back in the day. However if you can pick-up this game cheap on steam then get it because it’s certainly not a bad game but nice to play through Half-Life again with a new campaign.","June 3, 2015","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
