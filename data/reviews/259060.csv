I learned about Dom3 just a week before Dom4 came out but what I learned about it in that time was enough to buy this game for 30 euros on bloody Desura. And that was 1st time in years when I bought a game outside of Steam.\n\nAre you getting bored by your 10th Crusader Kings' world conquest?\nHave you conquered whole Europe as Palatinate in EU4 ironmode?\nYou wish Rome 2 was less graphic and actually some content?\n\nThen Dominions 4 is clearly a game for you.\n\nYou can tell it's 10 years of constant development. With 70 different factions, thousands creatures and spells ou guys are in for a treat!\n\nSingle player and AI leave much to be desired but they are just a training ground for great multiplayer experience. There are few more gratifying things than fighting seasoned veterans of this title. Especially since community is very helpful and welcoming allowing you to survive learning curve with just a few broken limbs.\n\nDominions 4 multiplayer is like a chess. If chess had 3.000 diferent units instead of 7 and could be played with few dozens people.\nAnd was cool.\nAnd had dragons.\nAnd ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of spells.\n\nIf you are into all that just buy it.

I think, I will stick to "good/bad" parts instead, to show what is there.\n\nSo, my pros:\n\n- Game is complex. Scalable complex. You can blindly research everything, and throw masses of your troops to win; or you can tinker with initial placement and orders; or you can plan anything - from right artifacts equipped to expert armies assembled - everything will work in single player... for some extent, of course. (Multiplayer requires good knowledge of game, so it will be complex by default).\n\n- Game is vast and diverse. I cannot remember another strategy with at least 4 significantly different races to play (and no, 3 units and 2 advancements doesn't count as "significant"). Dominions 4 have dozens of races, and most of them requires different approach. Sometimes vastly different. There are hundreds of researcheable spells - and it's real, significant spells, not another "Fireball III" type of things. There are dozens of craftable artifacts too - from simple helmets and boots to unique Holy Arc or Staff of Mages that can be only one per game. And there are whole lot of magic sites! And random events too! You got the picture.\n\n- It have planned orders, and what more important - turn-based AI-controlled battles with initial order queue! I think, it's most realistic turn-based scenario: in real battles it's local commanders who matters, not warlord - after initial plan developed, of course.\n\nAnd now contras:\n\n- Graphics. Poor pixellated graphics from 90s. I still believe that good pixel artist could vastly improve visuals here - but, well, I am not the author, and forums thinks that graphics not matters. Oh, well.\n\n- Interface. It greatly improved since first installation, but still can be very unintuitive here and there. And many commands accessible only via hotkeys. And no filters and sorting for statistics. And not very elaborating reports for everything that are not battles... Oh, well, it definitely could be much better.\n\n- No diplomacy. No pacts, trades, unions or anything. Last part have "minions" system, but it not matters much for single-player, given you AI-controlled armies - and that's all. I think, MP-games more affected by that, but I am not a big fan of multiplayer.\n\n- Limited exploration. You can see whole map right from the beginning. Of course, you cannot see province details, enemy armies, and all magic sites still must be searched individually - but still, in my dreams it could be better!\n\n- Realms-based gameplay. I like to be free, with vast territories, journeys to foreign places and founding cities where I need them. Well, not that game, obviously.\n\nBut regardless of described flaws, game remains one of most big, and complex, and elaborate 4X-strategy on market. I love it. Strongly recommended.","June 3, 2014","true","202.5"," 189 of 208 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","189","208","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DavidMcMurdo/recommended/259060/","DavidMcMurdo","David McMurdo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DavidMcMurdo/","130 products in account","I love strategy games. LOVE THEM. My favourites from the last twenty years include (in order) Age of Wonders III, Zeus: Master of Olympus, Crusader Kings II, Seven Kingdoms II, and Warlords III. Strategy fans will know that that's a fairly ecclectic mix of strategy sub-genres. Well, three days after purchasing Dominions 4 I can safely say that it has a place somewhere near the top of my list. I can't stop playing this game.\n\nI'd heard whispers about the Dominions series down through the years. Legend had it that it was the most hardcore of the hardcore. In all honesty its reputation was rather intimidating. The ancient sages were right: I was baffled for my first three games. However, don't think that it's a project to merely get into Dominions 4. It really isn't. The appropriate phrase is, "easy to learn, difficult to master." That's Dominions 4.\n\nThe supreme god who brought order to the universe has disappeared, leaving it to a bunch of pretender gods to fight it out for His former position. You are one of those pretenders. Your first decisions will include what faction you want to control, which age of time you wish to play in, what physical form you'll take in the world, and how your influence will impact the lands under your dominion. The depth behind these choices alone is awesome.\n\nOnce you've chosen one of the many pre-made maps (or generated a random one) and have customised the scenario settings to your liking, it's time to conquer the world one province at a time until you've claimed the required number of Thrones of Ascension. Though even the victory condition is customisable.\n\nIn the process of doing this you'll command mighty armies, raise glorious heroes, spread the truth of your holy word, cast powerful spells, quell uprisings, contend with the fickle hand of fate in the form of random events, forge magic items, manage the economics of your realm, and a whole load more. This truly is one of those games that makes it impossible for you to keep track of time while you're playing. You may think that the graphics are simplistic (and they are), but trust me, after five minutes I don't see pixels anymore. All I see are my Atlanteans (or "Atlantians" as these developers have it) emerging from the ocean to crush all before them. I can't remember the last game I played that was so immersive. Your expectations would be better adjusted by considering Dominions 4 a board game with animated battles.\n\nOne thing that made me hesitate to buy the game were the number of reviews (positive ones) that cast a negative light on the single-player. This concerned me since I never have any interest in multiplayer whatsoever and only buy games for solo play. I'm very glad I decided to take a risk because the AI is a worthy opponent even on "Normal" difficulty. Looking through the updates I can see that a lot of work has been done on the AI since the time of release which probably accounts for the earliest reviews complaining about it and my experience towards the end of 2015 being totally different.\n\nBy this point in my review you'll probably already know whether or not this is the game for you, but let me share some of the cool elements in Dominions 4. You can rename not only your pretender god, but also any of your commanders. The factions in the game (there's loads of them) are all totally unique and change depending on the age you choose to play in. Those factions are all based on mythology from around our world, meaning you can live out your Arthurian or Atlantean fantasies (you have them too, right?) Your heroes can get wounded, which may involve losing one or more limbs. Characters will age and can weaken as they get older before finally dying, however some species live longer than others. The combat is detailed to the point that each unit not only has specified methods of attack, but does particular types of damage too. You can fight on the ocean floor, and some factions are aquatic. The music is wonderful.\n\nIn conclusion, Dominions 4 is one of those games that you come away from with a thousand hilarious and tragic tales to tell. It's perfect for emergent storytelling. In terms of being a strategy game, yes it's highly complicated and very deep, but it doesn't put a brick wall in front of you. With each game you play you'll utilise the latest thing you've learned until at last you understand the dynamics in play. This discovery process doesn't make you groan at the prospect of facing it; it excites you and makes you want to learn more. You'll be thinking about potential strategies as you lie in bed at night. The fact that the entire Dominions series is created by just two guys (under the company name "Illwinter Game Design") makes all the great aspects of the game even more amazing.\n\nOn a final note: I've ordered the physical manual available from the game's website. Doing such a thing is unheard of for me, but Dominions 4 is so good it's worth it.","October 14, 2015","true","40.4"," 135 of 141 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","135","141","2","2"

Among the turn-based heroic fantasy strategy games (sorry), Dominions is the ugly guy that no one is talking to. If you dare to speak to him he'll give you access to an amazing world. But not before 3 quests:\n\n- Overcome ugliness: Dominions 4 is ugly, the screenshots dont lie! Units are 2D sprites, poorly animated and there's a good reason for that: content. I dont wanna go into numbers but with so many units, spells, magic items.. you can't expect a shadered 3D model reflecting the sun through tree leafs. Try to imagine the map as a a real map someone just scrolled in front of you asking: how are we going to make those guys believe in you? About the battles: it's somehow poorly animated (but everything is visible i.e units/spells/damage) but i can't find the words to express how i felt in front of my first 300vs300 battle, spells going on from both side, oh man that was awesome.\n\n- Provide a proof of imagination. What is going on in Dominions 4 is the rise&fall of your God in a world where Gods are in competition with each other. This is your story and it's even more funny if you can put yourself into it. There is a large background (descriptions for each races, heroes, units...) to help you with this.\n\n- Get ready for complexity. This game is deep, really deep. The learning curve is slow & long but not frustrating. You'll be amazed how detailed things are. Last game my god got killed cause one of my sorcerer casted an armor spells which explode on death, guess who took the blast? Not mentioning my 1 armed/1eyed Heroic centurion commanding the largest part of the empire's army. The interface is strange, but i can't say it's bad cause i got used to it after a couple of hours, and you can play with the mouse only. There's also a huge 400 page manual (27 pages for tutorial) to explain everything.\n\nHeavily recommended\n\n\n","September 24, 2014","true","170.5"," 145 of 156 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","145","156","2","2"

I purchased the game on sale, but after having played it I would recommend it even for full price to anyone who's looking for a deep, complex strategy game.\n\nDominions 4 plays like a highly advanced fantasy version of Civilization or similar turn-based games. That's not to say that it's super difficult to play - the basic mechanics are pretty simple once you get the hang of the somewhat odd control scheme where LMB is used for most things where you'd normally expect to use RMB (RMB is always used to get more info on something, instead of giving orders). I was able to feel somewhat competent without any tutorials, having only watched some brief gameplay on YouTube. However the game reveals layer after layer of complexity once you really start getting into it, and it definitely follows the "easy to play, hard to master" philosophy. There will be a learning curve once you get beyond the basics - the manual is almost 400 pages long.\n\nSo, what can you do in this game that makes it worth the time instead of just playing a Civilization?\n* Choose a faction and a pretender god as its leader from just about any mythology and creature you can think of. Dragons, wizards, lizard men, frost giants, weird fungus monsters, sea serpents, cthulu, you name it.\n* Recruit a general for every one of your armies, with his own name (given by you), stats, equipment, and experience.\n* Separate your armies into formations and give them orders to follow in battle (you still don't need to micromanage the battles themselves; they play out between turns)\n* Sacrifice virgins to your blood god and use the power to summon demons or forge magical artifacts.\n* Spread your icy dominion to freeze over rivers so your armies can cross it.\n* Call forth an army of undead and march it into the sea to surprise your enemy or control undersea territory.\n* Cast a spell to plunge the entire world into utter darkness.\n* March huge armies over all the land, then suddenly lose the game because no one believes in your god anymore (yeah, that happened to me).\n\nSo if you can get past the graphics (yeah, I know, it takes a lot to get past the graphics), you'll be rewarded with a rich, cerebral, highly replayable game in Dominions 4.","January 8, 2015","true","27.3"," 104 of 106 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","104","106","6","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadjackfr/recommended/259060/","deadjackfr","Deadjack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadjackfr/","898 products in account","Have you ever tried board games such as Warhammer or Confrontation ?\n\nNow forget everything and take characters inspired of mythology/legends and stories from the whole world, a huge variety of units (with 3 new factions, the game has more than 1000 different units!!!!) and a deep turn based strategy... and you have Dominions 4: Thrones of Ascension.\n\nBehind its aspect rought around the edges, Dominion is an extraordinary game capable to be a true competitor against table games such as Warhammer and others.\n\nYou start by choosing a culture and a pretender god. This character will lead your faction through the game and keeping him alive is extremely important even if you can bring him back after a while. You can customize his appearance (around 20 skins per faction) and his skills to suit your gameplay: Will you be a terrible fighter relying on massiv armies, a talented spell caster focused on searching and summoning powerfull spells or maybe the both and wait few turns until he awakes from his dormant state ?\n\nDominion is a turn based strategy game where you, the pretender god, have to exterminate every other factions or sit on  one of the Thrones of Ascension to reach a new plane of existence and became the god above all other pretender gods.\n\nYou start with a main fortress with different bonus and buildings depending on what kind of faction you have choosen.\nAs an example my favourite faction is R'yleh: Fallen star, inspired of Lovecraft's Cthulhu, this faction has a portal named the "Void gate" where you can try to summon new creatures by using a competent summoner.\nEven if you can get some of the most dangerous units of the game, the void gate can bring hostile monsters capable to kill your wizards.\n\nLike for every factions, everything has its price, thinking and planning carefully are keys for victory.\nAll factions are different and quite a lot of them forces you to learn an other way to play the game.\n\nAs an example R'yleh is mainly based on brainwashed magical units and when you need to use humans or humanoid troops, you will be forced to get new commanders and divide your army because magic beeings can only be lead by a magical commander.\nAdd to that the moral and the supplies your army needs wich can affect their health or worst, to be more encline to fail against the enemy dominion and run away.\n\nDominion is an other great aspect of the game. It represents the spread of the culture and the religion of your faction.\nEach pretender god can boost its dominion to give malus to the enemy or bonus to his land.\nAnd it's where the game is clever because quite early you will have to choose if you rush into the battle with spells or try to stay back and research in new magical disciplines to summon many things or affect enemy dominion, ect....\n\nThe game is quite open and give you the ability to enjoy quite a lot of strategies. The A.I is really powerfull and has always, ALWAYS, a way to get the upper hand.\n\nThe screenshots you see on the store page are the recordings of some battles.\nAs a turn-based strategy game, you have to plan everything, from the spell your wizards will cast in the battle, to the actions/ movements your squads will do.\nYou can even choose a formation with bonus and malus. Will you trample the infantry and rush to these coward archers ? Or let you wizards/ range units rain hell upon enemy heroes ?\nThere are plenty ways to manage fights even if you can't act during them.\nBut be ware ! You can enable events wich can affect you on every tiles of the map or everybody and sometimes things turns really bad...\n\nThe most important aspect in Dominion is magic wich is related to an enormous tree of research.\nYou can summon creatures, structures, cast world wide spells, teleport your units, bless and give tons of abilities to your troops such as invisibility, the gift of underwater breathing or flying, ect...\nYou can even forge magical items to give to your commanders !\nEvery spells must but prepared and choosed before each fights or you can let your commander decide but you won't get all the subtleties of magic.\n\nEach school of magic is related to a mana gem that you can gather on the map or with special events. Some kind of currency between your units, you have to manage and give them to you commanders before they go to war. The more you have the better, some schools of magic need slaves for sacrifices and of course give powerfull spells but reduces the stability and the population of your regions. Some factions are even unable to recruit units with gold, so you will have to spare mana gems for the invocation of new troops or commanders !\n\nBut i will stop here for the gameplay because nobody can deal about every aspects in a review.\nThis game is unforgivable and has a slow paced learning curve as many said the game manual has 400 pages...\n\n400 PAGES ! (Thanks to Niky 45 because I was wrong about the  number of pages)\n\nSo you understand why it can be so hard to talk about everything this game has to offer ^^\n\n\n\nAs an  example my last game session: after few hours (22 hours !!) of fail attempts to master Ry'leth and the map i've choosed (the game has quite a ot of maps with different strategies, to master one is allready a prowess...),  I was beaten by and army from a corner of the map (hate thoses war elephants !!!)  capable to  trample my best commanders and units  and with spells I've never seen before !\nI had an army of arround 2000 or 3000 units and Ry'leth has covered about 2 tiers of the world after having slain 6 pretender gods.\nMy pretender god, Kraahaul the Void Lord, died in a miserable fight against this suddent powerfull new enemy...\n\nAnd you know what ? I want more !\n\nEven if you can't build much structures ( only labs, temples and 3 types of castles with their upgrades) and affect your population ( a research tree about the dominion itselft would have been great), or use diplomatic skills between factions (you are at war with everybody) this game is really good.\n\n\nIn fact the perfect strategy game would be a mixt of Dominion, Total War and Warhammer.\nI hope to see the day when this kind of game will come !\n\nIf you are not scared about a very hard/deep strategy game and simple graphics try Dominion 4: Throne of Ascension.\nYou won't be disapointed...\n\nAnd i put you to the test to master R'yleh: Fallen star and spread the void and the tentacles of the Starspawns on all over the world !\n\nMUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !\n\nThis is why i love this game ^^\n\nN.B: i've forgot, this game has a multiplayer. Yeah i know i'm a coward... because i haven't tried it !\nDominions 4: Thrones of Ascension is a game for men, be ware !","November 5, 2014","true","36.1"," 126 of 141 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","126","141","0","8"

He had assembled an army of 80 men clad in the finest black steel, his own black armor was forged by the master smiths of Ulm, the two handed black halberd heavy enough to chop through even a knight and his horse. He strode forward with the weapon in hand, alone except for his thoughts when movement through his narrow eyeholes in his helmet drew his attention. A man clothed all in black stared at him, nodded and ran forward a longsword appearing in his hands.\n\nGawain parried the first blow with a sweep of his halberd and launched a furious blow diagonally downward catching the man across the legs as he attempted to dodge the blow. The man stumbled but still stood, blood poured from the massive gashes across his legs, crippled and limping the man could barely move and Gawain laughed as he stepped in close to deliver the final blow. The man, just barely staying on his feet slashed desperately at the young prince....and blade met flesh and tore through into open air only to bite into flesh and rip through again.\n\nGawain stared at the spurting bloody stumps where his hands and part of his forearms had been. The huge black halberd lay on the ground next to him his hands still clutched tightly around the handle. The young prince screamed as the pain assailed him and he tried to stumble backwards, away from the man with the blade but his eyes locked onto the blade the man was swinging and he could not bring himself to turn his back and die without seeing. No, the young prince would not die at all. Still screaming in pain but feeling anger flair in his chest Gawain hurled himself at the man with the sword and without a fist to swing found himself kicking with all his strength into the mans chin.\n\nWith a loud crack the man fell backwards and lay still. Gawain stared at the motionless body for a few seconds and stumbled away. His blood dripped onto the ground and he found himself feeling rather tired. In the distance he could hear the shouts of his men. Dully he thought they might've been drawn by the sounds of battle or his screams. Either way, they would find him soon. Sighing he sat down against a tree, and waited nothing in the world but exhaustion and pain.\n\nTLDR: New commander had an assassination attempt on him, gave the attacker cripple and limp afflictions with first blow, and then got both his arms cut off, then he kicked the assassin to death.

The problem is that game is horribly NOT for general audience, who "fans of Civilization and HOMM series" and don't intrested in wargames as a genre. It's not a casual game, it's developed by very small team for very specific type of player, to those who value very complex game mechanics more than anything else. Those people don't care about graphics so much. These are the same people who play SS13, Dwarf Fortress, Steel Panthers and the like in 2014 and don't understand why those games appear "outdated" to someone - they still have unrivalled mechanics as of today. And that's the only thing that matters.\n\nCriticism of PBEM MP in this game is baseless. Actually, it is THE MP format best suited for such type of games. After game session progresses beyond initial expanding and settling stage, some turns can take literally HOURS of thinking and trying different solutions. In bigger sessions with bigger maps it's uncommon to have turnlimit time set to several DAYS, so no one would feel pressed by it. Do somebody intend to wait hours while his opponent tries to figure out his best plan for this turn, like, at the keyboard? I don't think so. We actually played it like this in Dom3, and after first 10-20 turns it becomes just too painfull to endure all the waiting. It's much better to play this in PBEM. That is, it's so for any turnbased wargame.\n\nThe criticism of lack of tutorials and not so convinient UI is at least acceptable. The problem with first is that the game is so complex behind the curtains, that to write some good and all-embracing HOWTO is nearly impossible. One can go to fan forums and check for himself that for every of several dozens of ingame races (I'm takin in account three different Ages existing in the game, so one race, if present in all three, can feel substantionally different depending on Age) there are several - sometimes totally different - aproaches, which many times will depend on whom you are facing in this particular game session as an enemy and a friend. The problem with second is that development team is quite restricted in terms of resources and try to focus on more important (for the audience of such games) things, related to game mechanics.\n\nThe combat's design stems out of those peculiarities layed out above. They tried to do it the way somehow predictable and transparent, as you won't be able to correct it in real time. Still I'll give it to haters that it's a little oversimplistic, but hopefully will be expanded in years to come (in Dom4 they added formations, for example).\n\nBasically, those reviewers didn't even have a chance to peek behind the curtains of simplistic looking UI to discover the indisputable variety which comes with magic system and different Pretender's/dominion's types strategies, which really make this game shine.","July 1, 2014","true","71.9"," 120 of 144 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","120","144","0","6"

They've also probably said things like "if you love spreadsheets, you'll love this game." Both of these statements hold truth. Here's what you'll find in the game\n\nPros:\n- The largest variety of choices I've seen in any video game.\n- Over twenty races, each radically different in a way that still tends to balance itself out.\n- Three eras of play, each radically affecting said twenty races. Changes range from shifting their focus to turning them into different nations entirely.\n- Weird and wonderful lore everywhere.\n- A robust and well-crafted magic system.\n-Most of the actual micromanagement is under the hood, and a lot of things can be automated, allowing you to spend your time on the more important stuff.\n- It'll run on a potato.\n\nCons:\n- Said choices are shoved in your face up front, and even with the handy tooltips, it's hard to get what they all mean.\n- Unless you read the doorstopper of a manual, you will be confused. And even then, it takes experimentation to actually know what every number means.\n- The wrong mistake at the wrong time can send your entire civilization kicking and screaming into the abyss.\n- Multiplayer is plagued by a meta nearly as bad as DOTA 2.\n- All that important stuff you micromanage? It's still a lot.\n- It has the kind of graphics you'd expect from a potato.\n\nDon't be scared by its price tag, either. It's 35 dollars, but it's already given me more replay value than nearly any game I've spent 60 bucks on, and it's definitely given me more content. But if you're really adamant about saving money, wait till a sale.

The only other game i've played anywhere near as much is tabletop rpgs.  But i'm biased, old hand, fan, etc.  This guy isn't.  Here's what he had to say on the Steam forum.\n\nOriginally posted by Stephen:Earlier tonight, one of the most epic occurences I have ever seen in a video game occured. Seeing that as a sign of a good game and also worth telling about, I decided to post here for your reading pleasure. Since it is only due to a confusing chain of events that this occured, I'm going to tell the full story from start to finish. Enjoy.\n\nRecently I started a MA game with my friend. It was Agartha and Pangea (me and my friend) up against 6 other pairs ( Ermor and Arcosephale, Ashdod and Nazca, Tien Chi and Caelum, Eriu and Ulm, Asphodel and Vanarus, Sceleria and Man ). Settings were for a long enjoyable coop game against the AI, with story events, conquest all, clustered spawns, and common random events. To start, we are luckily positioned with the one sea as our northern border ( the map had full wraparound), and mountains close by. We expand quickly and have a nice lump of land before we begin having conflicts with our neighbors, Ermor to the west and Ashdod/Nazca to the south. Im forced to support my Pangean friend with large blocks of Agarthan infantry supported with living statues so we can push back the enemies to the south. During the delay, Ermor casts a global enchantment, Burden of Time. Realizing the issues with all of our units dying of old age, we immediatly leave a small border garrison and charge our resources at Ermor. The endless legion combined with the death 3 provinces causes massive attrition, wearing our armies down to nothing and resulting in the deaths of my top commanders, excpet for one, Ernst, the Cave Captain. He has already aged to 45 / 50 from the Global Enchantment, so I prepare a suicide battalion of my remaining elderly units to rush Ermor and slay their god to end the enchantment. In a long battle across Ermor, I manage to corner and kill him in their capital. In the mean time, I've also rushed my way into Blood Magic to unlock Boots of Youth, which Ernst gets at the ripe age of 49, 1 year before old age. The Encantment is dispelled, but most players without undead focus have been crippled from its effects. My researchers are all diseased and my armies crippled. Ernst and only a few other commanders were given boots in time, the rest being too wounded to salvage. I recruit new generals, one of which being Aripert. The game is peacful for a time, but soon Ashopdel begins attacking. Im ready. Aripert and Ernst lead a combined force of over 400 Agarthan infantry, supported by foul spawn and living statues. Ashopdel is crushed, but their ally Vanarus pushes me back, killing most of my army. My commanders retreat, and I get a story event at my capital. A band of adventurers has joined the cause. I put them to good use as supporting commanders and mages for Aripert and Ernst. I launch a new attack at Ashopdel and Vanarus, killing the former and sieging the latter. My ally in the meantime has been fighting the war from the opposite side, and we meet together at Vanarus's capital. I storm first, Ernst, Aripert, and adveturers as commanders, a a vangaurd of Agarthan Living Statues in the front, foul spawn on the flanks, and Agarthan infantry in the core. The battle is brutal, with the archer towers killing 2 of my 6 adventurers, and my force being hit with many spells. Inside the fort is Vanarus' God, the Son of Fenrir. My own commanders have reached hall of fame status with 4 EXP and a heroic ability each. The battle rages, and I notice the adventures have been casting Nature 2 spells Enlarge and Enrage on my commanders. Suddenly, my small Cave Captains Ernst and Aripert have turned into size 4 killing machines, but are unable to get into combat. Eventually, morale breaks in both sides, and the mages run off the fields. My statues and the enemy elementals collapse into dust, leaving our core infantry to fight. The Son of Fenrir enters combat with his wolves, decimating my men while their men are whittled away by my more tanky infantry. The core infantry of their side routes, but mine route aswell after slaying the wolve body guards of their pretender god. All thats left are Ernst and Aripert, leading the charge alone. Against a god. With 200 hp. and Regen. I prepare for the worst, and to my astonishment Ernst strikes their god down with his enchanted Sword of Swiftness, with Aripert supporting. Vanarus was knocked out of the game, and a basic Cave Captain recruiting for a suicide mission many years ago had slain a god.","April 17","true","486.1"," 50 of 53 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","50","53","8","0"

Be warned though, this is a game for folks who really enjoy turn-based strategy games (TBS), especially multi-player TBS (Disclaimer:  I have not tried Dominions 4 MP yet, but Dominions 3 MP was tremendous).  But if you are looking for high-end graphics, a gentle learning curve, hand-holding tutorials or a casual strategy gaming experience, you may want to look elsewhere.\n\nHowever, if you are a fan of TBS games, Dominions 4 has tremendous depth, content and attention to detail.  From the ability to customize your god to each race with unique abilities, there are many variables to make each game unique.  Gameplay can be a bit daunting initially, but rewards players who carefully plan and execute those strategies.\n\nMy only negative at this time regarding Dominions 4 is it appears to be a bit too similar to Dominions 3 which I played heavily in the pre-Steam days.  I’ll update this review after additional playtime with other factions and MP to highlight some of the changes from Dominions 3.\n","March 30, 2014","true","25.4"," 61 of 70 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","61","70","0","0"

After all, in what other game can you have a deathmatch between Gods that lead nations such as Spanish Inquisition, Atlantian Eskimos, Man-eating Giant Jews, The Mongols, Undead Romans and the like? What other game allows you to have reality-altering magic or armed-to-the-teeth titans capable of wiping out armies single-handedly while remaining "balanced"?\n\nNow, it should go without saying that Dominions 4 has low production value and it's not a stellar single player game. Some veteran players have also raised concerns about a couple of changes (like removal of reverse communions) that might end up hurting it in the long run (I don't dare to make a claim for either direction myself). However, as far as I can tell, Dominions 4 is still an upgrade over its predecessor, and even if some of the issues come to haunt it in the long run, there's only one game that even compares, and that's Dominions 3, a proven masterpiece. Dominions 4 is probably even better, and with the bulk of MP-games being made to it right now and improvements to single player being noticeable (even if not huge), it's the obvious choice if you want some Dominions action.","December 5, 2013","true","5.1"," 87 of 110 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","87","110","0","0"

Strategic gameplay is maybe the deepest of any non-abstract computer game ever made, but/and also entirely unbalanced, unforgiving and uncompromisingly hard. This is to say, you need to know exactly what you're doing at every point in the game or you'll just suddenly die (no matter how well you seem to be doing) and have to start over (or find another game if doing multiplayer). There is no save (Although you can backup the game-files manually to effectively make one). While this caters to the target audience perfectly (this game is 10/10 if spending about a year full-time, studying its every little nuance, appeals to you), but makes it a less than good game objectively.\n\nThe fantasy themes are very well presented, and the best part of the game is how it lets you create The Lion or The Witch of Narnia, or Gandalf or Sauron, or a DnD Lich-King, or a Titan of the Greek Mythologies or just about any classic powerful being as a pretender to godhood. No other game on any media have been able to mix a fraction of the themes or come close to portraying them as well as Illwinter.

The game lets you take mythological lore from around the world and pit it in wars for ultimate domination. You will see Titans warring against undead legionares, yomi fighting against valkeries, and lich kings unleashing death on the men of Avalon.\n\nTo me, Dom4 feels like a Ck2/Total War-esque type of strategy game, where you fight to expand your territory, spread your dominion (religion), and develop your nation. Where it really shines is its deep magical paths and unit diversity. I play the game with my second monitor open to the Dom4 mod inspector (http://larzm42.github.io/dom4inspector/) where I can compare and contrast every item, spell, unit, and magic site in the game. With 25 nations in each time period, combined with the numerous magic paths one can decide to branch into, their are many many combinations of strategies and development. In other words, no two players may play the same nation the same way, they may play off different strengths depending on how they designed their pretender (leading god of their nation).\n\nThis game to me is an easy to play, tough to master - which opens up for hours and hours of gameplay. You can play against the AI who offer a fair challenge (albeit becoming predicatble as you play more - such is expected with strategy AI), and when you seek a higher challenge it offers both real time and play by email multiplayer. I didn't think I would enjoy the play by email system but it's really relaxing to have a few games going at once and getting to do a turn or two per day before and after work/school. I always look forward to downloading my turns and seeing how my wars turned out, what kind of events popped out, and coming up with a plan for the next turn. All the while trying to formulate long term magic goals that will keep me relevant into the late game.\n\nIn short, if you enjoy strategy, fantasy, mythology, or games such as Total war, Paradox strategy titles, or even the Civ series, do yourself a favour and give Dominions 4 a try.","February 5, 2015","true","61.9"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","33","35","2","0"

Several new items were added, and some were rebalanced while others were rewritten to reflect actual affects.

But I feel like I should write something for it to let others know about this game.\n\nThis game is big, complex, and it all makes sense. There are massive amounts of strategies and a lot of depth, with a detailed world that all factors into how factions play. There are a large amount of factions, all of which have their own units and their own backstories, and a large amount of mythological beings, potential gods, and random events that can potentially completely change your experience.\n\nThe game is a tale about pretender gods, all together trying to eliminate the others so that they become the one real god. As the player, you control one such pretender god - Fully customised to your own likings and their nation/faction. Expand, research, play to your nation's strength, build up a massive army, and try to conquer the world. The keyword here being TRY, because every other faction has a pretender god trying to do the exact same thing, and things will often not go as planned.\nYou do not personally control the tactical combat, you only control the large picture. The army movement, the research, and important people(Such as scouts, mages, and commanders).\n\nIt may be overwhelming, and with a 300 page manual it's certainly not an easy game, but you don't need to know the top tier strategies to understand what's going on. Even without understanding most of the game you can enjoy it, with the large amount of mythology, customisation, and detail involved, you can easily weave your own tales of what happens in the world.\nAs a side note, the interface needs a little bit of learning too, but things become clear if you take a step back and calmly read the buttons and try them out\nAfter all this time, I still have moments where I meet entirely new things I haven't seen yet, so I can not tell you much about the great strategies that will let you win.

That may be so, though I don't see how we're supposed to know that in advance -- they certainly don't advertise it that way.  But I'll concede that point and note that this review is targeted mainly at folks interested in the single player experience.\n\nAnyway... I *really* wanted to like this game.  I've been a strategy game addict going back to the days of board games with thousands of little cardboard counters.  So I was as excited as a puppy when I read that Dominions 4 has a 400 page manual.  It had to have incredible depth, right?  Wrong.  It has a lot of *content*, but that's not the same thing.\n\nDominions 4 has hundreds of different spells and units -- but who cares when you can't actually use them?  The game ultimately revolves *entirely* around combat, but combat is always resolved automatically.  At best you're a spectator, but after watching a dozen or so battles with a new faction to get a feel for what combination of units works well, you probably won't even bother with that.\n\nAnd without the ability to participate in combat, there just isn't that much to do.  Despite the creative and well-researched styles particular to each of the many playable factions, no matter which faction you choose, gameplay quickly degenerates into a tedious slog of building units, moving them to the front, and throwing them into combat.  Build, move, repeat.\n\nThe game has features like combat scripting and magic items, but unfortunately they don't affect the *experience* provided by the game.  For example, you can craft a magic sword and equip your army commander with it, but the only difference that makes is that when you read the next battle report, your army's losses might be 10% less.  If that's your idea of fun, good for you, but as far as I'm concerned it's about as exciting as playing a spreadsheet.\n\nThe game can be broken into two main parts: the strategic level, where you build and move armies around the map; and the tactical level, where combat is resolved on a smaller-scale map containing all the units in the two conflicting armies.  I'll contrast each of those parts to a game that I think does that part really well.\n\nIf grand strategy is your thing, I would say the state of the art is currently exemplified by the Europa Universalis franchise.  In EU4 different nations really *do* play very differently, and you actually *do* have the option of pursuing many different strategies that make real differences both in how the game plays and in the outcomes you get.  Maybe I'm missing something, but Dominions 4 hardly seems to have a strategic element to it at all.  For all their different "background flavor", the different factions ultimately play virtually the same way.  It really makes no difference whether your armies are composed of human swordsmen or giant hydras, whether your spellcasters specialize in blood magic or fire magic, whether your faction likes heat or cold or even lives underwater -- the only "strategy" you can pursue in this game is universal conquest, and the only strategic-level decisions to make are the order in which you attack enemy provinces.\n\nThere's some slight interest in choosing the best unit combinations for your army, but it's not that hard -- in fact it's mostly a rather tedious chore of comparing unit statistics -- and once you do that you don't ever have to bother looking at them again.  Once you've chosen units A, B and C for your army, regardless of your faction it then boils down to "build 5 of A, 3 of B, and 6 of C" every turn, stacking them up, throwing them at the enemy, and then *reading* the combat results.  Put all that together, and Dominions barely even qualifies as a strategy game.  It certainly doesn't excel at it.\n\nAt the tactical level, Dominions is two or three *decades* behind the times.  Consider the King's Bounty franchise: like Dominions, those games also feature lots of different units, spells and magic items; but unlike Dominions, you can actually *use* them in combat, where they have obvioiusly differing, tangible effects.  What's more, you can *see* these effects via their superb unit and spell animations and sound effects.  In fact, I'd argue that "despite" its vastly superior graphics and sound, King's Bounty is also a vastly superior combat simulation.  Even if you're OK with Dominions simulating combat for you (and I don't see why you should be), there's just no way its AI is going to do a tenth as good a job as you could, regardless of any "scripting" you might do.  Building and customizing your army requires every bit as much planning in King's Bounty as the nearest equivalent in Dominions 4 -- and it's about 1000 times more satisfying in its execution.  In fact, combat resolution in Dominions is the most boring I've seen in a game since Risk.  And that's a problem, because this game is entirely focused on combat.\n\nThe final page of the tutorial highlights just what I dislike about this game.  It gives the example of how, if you want to invade a sea territory, you need to "plan ahead": you must first research construction magic until you know how to forge a ring of water breathing; and you also need a mage with sufficient skill to forge it; and you need enough magic gems to perform the construction; and then when it's all ready you give the ring to your army commander.  This all sounded very exciting when I read it, but then when I did it, it was just colossally dull.  There's no substance to any of these steps, and no payoff when it's been achieved.  They amount to nothing more than selecting items from text menus, and when you do, the game looks and plays looks exactly like it did before, except now you can move that leader into water provinces.  Whoopee.\n\nPlus, the game doesn't have any personality -- there are no quests, no dialogue, no diplomacy.  Again, this might be expected of a game whose focus is multiplayer, but that doesn't do any favors for the single player experience -- which, unfortunately, is as bland and lifeless as any game I've ever played.  Above any other considerations, a game should be fun, and Dominions 4 just isn't.","October 2, 2014","false","64.7"," 375 of 612 people (61%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","61","375","612","12","30"

Quality updates continue to trickle in, and I'm more than glad some of my money went to help the devs, and the future of Dominions.\n\nFor a "real" review, I'll talk about how the game plays. For each turn, you: 1. create new units or commanders and assign troops to those commanders 2. decide if you want to build any structures (temple, science-research, and castle/fortress/fortifications, basically) 3. assign new magic-school research, if needed 4. issue move orders, if any 5.

After playing this game for a while, I must say not telling you all how great the game is would be ridiculous.\n\nIntro:\nDominions 4 is a turn based strategy game created by a 2 man company Illwinter Game Design. The game places you in charge of one of MANY different nations in a struggle for global domination. The nation is lead by a powerful "pretender god" that you create prior to launching the game, who seeks to spread his/her dominion over the land. The developers based these factions around lore and culture of various peoples. A great example would be Mitlcan a tribal based kingdom that takes its roots from Aztec or another ancient Central or South American society. The nation has basic weapons but powerful magic that involves sacrificing blood slaves to use powerful blood magic against its enemies. There are also nations based around popular fiction such as the underwater nation Atlantis or Bandor Log who make you feel like the apes from "Planet of the Apes" etc. The developers release free updates to the game that include additional content! The manual is available to view online for free on their website just google it. For those who are interested you can even make your own maps to play on or write your own mods to use for the game. Free manual is available for modding & map design via developer website as well. The game does have an extremely steep learning curve as I have 253+ hours logged on steam playing mainly AI opponents, started playing with other players recently and I am being slaughtered. So I can honestly say its a deep and rewarding game you should try out. Beware it is one of those "I will just take one more turn...." kind of games and then next thing you know its 2am.\n\nPros:\n*very deep game with unique nation selection across 3 eras\n*unique units based on nations and independent provinces conquered\n*very deep magic system that revolves around different types of mages who perform research to gain powerful spells\n*8 paths of magic with over 800 spells! sorcery contains astral, blood, nature, and death magic. While elemental magic is fire,water,air and earth. Each magic path has a gem that fuels its artifacts and powerful spells except blood which uses blood slaves.\n*Solid single player mode that lets you play a challenging AI but the game really shines in multiplayer that is usually played in a “play by email” format.\n*Active community that create new maps and mods, active developers who patch bugs and release additional content for free\n*the game is very replayable because of all the variety and the multiplayer aspect I could go on for days with the pros but I will call it here\n\nCons, for me these aren’t really a big deal so they don’t take away from my experience but if I had to pick things out that gamers may not enjoy it would be:\n*graphics are a basic don’t expect any crazy animations or any cut scenes. One of the two devs does all the artwork a unit will have a regular animation and then an action animation that occurs when the unit attacks or casts a spell thats it.\n*the map actually makes you feel like you are looking at a real life map for the most part\n*combat is not real time you assign commands to your commanders and squads who will then perform those actions during combat, you will see the result of that after the fight has already been decided in a battle replay\n\nAs I stated I don’t actually mind any of the cons for me the game is great as designed. I hope you are scrolling up to the purchase button. I am interested in sharing more about this game because apparently I wrote up a short story as I ran out of room and had to really butcher the review. I will edit the review if I can host elsewhere.

Pretenders, not gods. Ctenophoros, the prophet of the Archmage, corrected himself. There had been no true gods since The Pantokrator had left this world. In his absence his former servants, wives, and adversaries shook off their shackles and began to reach for his thrones. How strange it had seemed back then, amongst the mystical giants and beasts and frightening monoliths, that the alien races of R'lyeh had chosen to worship a mere mortal. Stranger still that the stars had revealed to Ctenophoros that he was destined for victory.\n\nIn the early days, Ctenophoros had seriously considered if he had misjudged destiny. True, their early campaigns to subjugate the merfolk provinces had been a dramatic success, but no other pretenders cared for the deep ocean. Instead they fought bitter wars for control of the rich provinces and magical sites that lay further inland. The Archmage had thought it wiser to bide his time, research forgotten lore and fortify his treasury, while his rivals clawed at each other's throats.\n\nThen the undead of Ermor struck. R'lyeh had considered itself safe below the waves, but the skeletons and ghouls of Ermor had no need for air. Worse still, R'lyeh's Illithids found themselves unable to strike at these mindless creatures, and were cut down in droves. Only a desperate counter-attack of shark riders from the merfolk provinces was able to turn back the undead forces, but for five years, the Sea of Woe would be contested.\n\nThe bitter stalemate extended to the nearby coast, where R'lyeh had founded mighty a castle. There, they began a recruiting campaign. Compared to Ilithids, human priests were frail, but their banishment spells would stop the undead just the same. The strategy worked, after a fashion. Ermor's undead knights had a nasty habit of cutting priests down like wheat, but soon the Archmage ordered whole contingents of hybrid soldiers (born of the surface mortals and Deep Ones) to accompany them.\n\nThe tide had begun to turn, but when R'lyeh's forces marched into the newly-conquered land of Zenthra, they found a terrible surprise. The land was desolate, ruined, dead. Ctenophoros had remembered staring in awe at shear number of ghouls and skeletons who had attacked the Sea of Woe. How could Ermor have acquired so main bodies? As he looked at this newly-conquered wasteland, utterly devoid of life, he knew the terrible answer.\n\nThey had retreated, of course. R'lyeh's armies would find only starvation there and Ermor still threaten the eastern sea. Ctenophoros thought the situation hopeless, but the Archmage had a plan. In his endless nights of study in his library on the ocean floor, he had learned the secrets of the Naiads. Now he called upon them. Together, they forged enchanted bags of near limitless supplies. And thus magically equipped, their armies began the offensive anew. The Naiads had also lent their expertise in the magical school of evocation, teaching R'lyeh's armies to wield torrents of cleansing waters to purge the undead from the land. They pressed onwards, towards the undead capital.\n\nTo their surprise, Ermor was already under siege. The traitor princes (so called because they had abandoned Atlantis to serve R'lyeh) had summoned a massive army of fishmen and enslaved Atlanteans and had struck from the sea as Ctenophoros and his god had marched up the coast. But the undead don't starve, and R'lyeh could have no peace while Isis, the Neteret of many Names, still walked the earth.\n\nCtenophoros' god, The Archmage had insisted on taking part in the assault. His body has frail, but every spellcaster was needed. He would remain safe at the rear of the army and rain elemental fury down on the fortress's defenders. It should have worked, and maybe nine times out of ten, it would have. But this time he caught an arrow in the chest and was dead before the troops reached the walls. His death sent the army into disarray—the Atlanteans routed. But The Archmage had been right about the need for mages. Cleansing water decimated the undead ranks until only Isis remained. She stood 20 feet high and possessed armaments and magic the likes of which had never been seen in R'lyeh. But in the end, she was just a pretender. And eventually, the hybrid soldier's spears struck true and Emor was conquered.\n\nTwo pretenders had fallen, but they would not stay dead. So long as their faith held sway in this world they would return, soon or later. Ctenophoros hoped it would be later in Isis's case. Still, Ermor was not his largest concern. While R'lyeh was engaged in this bitter struggle for wastelands in the North, the Golem Cult of Agartha had come back from the brink of extinction to dominate the lands to the south. Troglodytes and terracotta warriors circled their southern borders greedily and spies had already been spotted in their lands. The Archmage had foreseen this war. The night before the assault on Ermor, he had given Ctenophoros an ancient scroll. Now, the prophet poured over this gift from his departed god—it was a summoning spell more complicated and terrible than anything had ever known. The Eater of the Dead, an amorphous mass of semi-liquified dead flesh. It was banished to the void by The Pantokrator before he left this world. And now, Ctenophoros had to the power to summon him back.","January 9","true","102.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","14","15","3","0"

That is, I believe, a warning as well as a recommendation. If you're willing to delve into a manual that reads like the core rules for an old and convuluted tabletop wargame, Dominions is probably your bag. Otherwise...it probably isn't.\n\nThe game has three ages, each with its own set of nations to play as, making the total something like 60. Some rise, some fall, and some change over the course of the timeline, so each Age has its own feel and mechanics. Each also has its own set of units. Some are generic, but there are literally thousands of unique units and monsters in the game.\n\nAlso spells; I've seen RPG's with less involved magic systems. There are a hair over 800 castable spells and a fair number (200 or so at a guess) magical items to craft.\n\nThe tactical combat is also quite deep. The player doesn't control it, but the player does organize their armies into formations and give them general orders. Which feels a bit more reasonable given the sheer scope the game can reach on larger maps.\n\nAlso worth noting is that instead of a generic fantasy setting, the factions and races here are based mostly on different historical mythologies, so there's that to keep it interesting as well.\n\nTL;DR:\nAre you going to cry about having to read, a slightly unintuitive GUI, poor graphics, or lack of tactical control?

Then I think Dominions may just be the Grand Strategy game you've been missing your whole life.","February 22, 2014","true","29.2"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

I got started with gaming on Age of Empires 1 and Starcraft. RTS and turn based strategy games have been some of my favorite genre's for about 15 years.\n\nDespite the fact that I've played one or two dozen such games extensively, nothing comes close to dominions 4.\n\nAlthough this game isn't for everyone, as it focuses very clearly on only one aspect of what would make a standard 4X strategy game, it does that one part of gameplay better than anything else by miles.\n\nWhat aspect is that? Combat. Everything revolves around crushing your oppenent in glorious combat, or erroding the his ability to fight with powerful magic. Dominions 4 has 78 unique nations. Although some nations keep their themes and gods through multiple ages slightly reducing diversity from what you might see with 78 totally different nations (the game has 3 "ages" it is played through, and many nations exist in multiple ages, but generally they transition to a different playstyle from age to age, with different mages and troops).\n\nThe sheer number of nations alone makes for an incredible degree of variety and depth, but you can also customize a 'pretender' , the demi-god ruler of your nation. This can make for vast differences in gameplay giving each nations 1-3+ viable strategies, not counting meta-strategies you might employ versus a group of players you know well.\n\nWe haven't even gotten to the good part yet though. The meat of the game is a powerful combat simulation engine that allows detailed troop formations, powerful magical spells, special monster units, and magical artifacts to be employed in battle. This provides enormous opportunities for you to turn the tide of battle with clever strategy and planning.\n\nOn top of that, supplies and research do play a role. You can base strategies around researching powerful magics quickly, securing vast amounts of gold to build a powerful mundane army around, or raiding your opponent until they can no longer support their forces.\n\nTake a look at the hours I've put into this game. I'd say I'm intermediate skill level. I could play most any nation competently, although I haven't nearly played them all. You will always have more to try and learn in this game, and it's more than worth any price it's ever been on steam.","March 14","true","649.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","12","12","2","0"

Also, there are still no elves, and that's awesome.\n\nDominions 4 is a turn-based fantasy strategy game that is about 99.985% substance and .015% style. The graphics endearingly suck, and that will turn more than a few people away, but a thorough check under the hood will reveal one of the most complicated and rewarding strategy experiences out there. Though it doesn't share all the features you may expect in your typical modern turn-based strategy game, the ones that it does have are taken to levels so unbelievably high that other games lose sight of it from their big-budget pedestals.\n\nIf the music upon boot-up sounds familiar, you probably played Dominions 3. I think I've heard a few new tunes, but it seems that all the originals are back. Once again, retuned Dom3.\n\nDiplomacy is nonexistant, so don't expect any non-aggression pacts or trade and research agreements with the AI or with your friends. Although a form of coop has been added, it has a certain wonkiness to it that makes it a little less enjoyable than simply making secret alliances with other human players. Backstab, backstab, bacsktab!\n\nThere are a ton of factions to choose from inside of 3 different ages of existence, all with many, many unit types serving many different purposes. I'm not going to try counting the number of unique units in this game, but it's definitely somewhere between holy crap and even more holy crap.\n\nDid I mention that in spite off all this variety there are no elves? That's a breath of fresh freaking air.\n\nThe magic system is just as varied as the soldiers in your armies, and there are tons of spells ranging from useless to game-ending. Experimenting with magic and finding what works what needs a little adjustment, and what just accidentally killed your entire army is half the fun. Compile that with a single save file and you may develop a light case of paranoia. I did.\n\nIf magic is the potatoes of this game, then combat is the steak, and it probably runs a bit different than what you may be used to. It involves a lot of indirect control and tactical trial and error. I'll admit it took some getting used to, and you will often find yourself wondering how your 400-something close-combat soldiers were scared off by a dozen elephants, but unexpected catastrophic defeats are all part of the fun. Just like when your fate conspires against you and a stray arrow takes your necromancer out of a fight, leaving your horde of undead to mindlessly scratch their butts while they're picked to pieces. There's so much to go into and so many hilarious stories, but you'll have plenty of opportunities to make your own.\n\nMy biggest warning: If you played the ealier Dominions and could not get into the swing of it, don't expect this to change that wind's direction. It's more of the same, but the keyword here is 'more'. If it was more you wanted, it's what you got. And It was definitely what I wanted. Kudos!\n\nLastly, Illwinter does sell a printed manual from their website. It's not necessary for the game, but it's certainly helpful.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jrhiga/recommended/259060/","jrhiga","Rhiga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jrhiga/","172 products in account","Over the first few games I played I had a very difficult time winning even on the normal AI settings, partly because I was playing as Early Age Yomi faction which is highly regarded as one of the weakest nations in the whole game. After playing for about the 6th or 7th time with other factions I came to the realization that while the game is quite fun learning how it works and discovering all the options that are avalailable to you there are 2 key things that make this game falling a few steps short of greatness which I will point out later in this review. Now please note that this is my first Dominions title I've played and I have no prior knowledge or experience playing of any of the titles before it.\n\nFirst off let me say what I like about this game, and there's quite a lot to enjoy in such a involving strategy game such as this, but a few I like to mention are the amount of content and spells that is within the package and how each nation plus god that you play as feel worlds different from each other, with different nations having access to a variety of different units and even their own spells, for instance the Bakemono nation in the middle age has their own racial summons to summon Oni onto the world map. Even after all that variety with approximately a dozen of different nations for each age and leaders you can choose from the game is won only by acquiring a number (chosen at the start of the game) of different thrones of ascension that are scattered throughout the map which can have quite a significant impact on all nations nearby once they are claimed by a player. I won't go into the specifics on how they do so now as it would take a whole summary of the game to explain details in the game that are prominent and quite arduous to understand (such as how dominion works and how your empires influence spreads). Let's just say that when you acquire these thrones, apart from giving you additional resources in the form of mana crystals, they can make the lands that are surrounding them more arid, temperate, hot, cold, or even unlucky just by having someone in control of them which can cause a huge impact on your playstyle or how you strategize about future moves. Another thing I like is that when I lost battles I felt that it was my own fault for not paying attention and not giving orders to a commander or a unit, or to forget putting my units in better defensive positions to deal with the enemies units, and while the combat is automated I still felt I had control on the outcome of each battle, which is not an easy thing to do for a strategy game that encapsulates so many different tactics and decisions to be made. The last thing I would like to mention about the pros of this game is that while this game may ultimately seem complex to many new players, in actuality it is a really simple strategy game to learn as your primary concerns are conquering lands and claiming the thrones of ascension, but the amount of choices that you have to achieve that goal are massive.\n\nNow on to my opinions on the flaws of the game. The 2 greatest flaws this game has is the diplomacy aspect of the game and the balance of each nation. Now normally the balance of each nation wouldn't be an issue for me in a strategy game like this but considering the degree of difficulty that can scale based on the nations you play can be quite offputting ESPECIALLY for new players trying to grasp the concepts of the game. It took myself 3 failed games and numerous attempts at reading strategy guides to try and figure out what I was doing wrong to win as the yomi in the early age and after failing miserably I finally pursued playing another nation that apparently was much more powerful and won with relative ease without that much of any challenge minus a few times where I had left my lands undefended, or stupidly throwing all of my units in a nation's home base. But balance issues aside, the one thing that I absolutely wish that this game did a better job of is diplomacy, and while I haven't played a game with the Disciple mode (where one nation is a pretender god and other nations are that god's disciples) the game is primarily focused on combat and map positioning as opposed to diplomatic relations and tech trading. And while you can research a massive amount of spells it would seem that having the better units in the army trumps out any spell that you can research midway throughout the game . Now I may be wrong on this for later spells that are high-end, but for every instance that I've played the spells that are cast in combat usually are a minor thing to worry about as opposed to whoever has the better quality and quantity of troops in battle. There are no peace treaties that you can formulate with other nations and one is forced to solve every situation in the game militaristically by conquering their neighbors and fighting for the thrones of ascension , which can be fun for while, but it leaves something to be desired. For instance, after around the 100th turn of a game or so I will still have some of the same enemies that I have dealt with handily since the start of the game that are still pestering me, and it gets kinda worn and laborious to cycle between creating troops, sending troops, and defending. Although I have only played on a Normal difficulty setting, the A.I. doesn't actively try to win the game by going straight for thrones of ascension but rather conquer lesser defended provinces of the player which is a decent enough strategy, but I feel is not realistic enough because any human  player would immediately try to go for the victory points with as many units they have from the get go.\n\nAll in all Dominions 4 was worth my hard earned cash, as I have no gripes about the graphics (as I really don't care about how a game looks) or my experiences with the game and I do expect to play more of it in the future but probably on higher difficulty settings. But as I said at the beginning of this review, what stops this game from achieving greatness in my eyes is the fact that there are no diplomatic relations that you can have with the other nations and there are nations that are drastically better suited for winning the game than others.","August 23, 2014","true","107.9"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","2"

It is a strategy game, with armies, regions, castles, and research, although I don't think many players would go so far to call it a full-blown 4X.  Maps are designed, rather than generated procedurally; diplomacy is remarkably limited; economic growth is streamlined to and past the point of CA games.\n\nThe short version of the review is that D4 is clearly a labor of love from an amateur developer with serious problems in presentation and interface.  Even if D4 is your cup of tea-- which it won't be for most-- this is not a game worth the asking price.\n\nSo before we get to what's bad, let's talk about what's good.  If you want variety, D4 has it.  There are a vast number of pretender gods to choose from, and each customizable from there, 3 eras each with 15 or so different factions, and each faction has a good supply of units to build, including heroes.  But the real variety comes from the spell book.  The number of spells may very well approach 1000.  Just a handful of those spells in the construction school allow you to build innumerable magic items.\n\nBut this vast variety is one of the failings of D4.  How many different spells protecting against fire need to exist?  How many different missile spells?  With D4, things are either unbearably streamlined (travel, growth) or else abstraction of mechanics is ignored completely (spells, magic items).  Consider D4's units.  When you open up your recruitment window, you're going to be greeted by as many unit descriptions as you'd ever enjoy reading-- and with each region conquered, you'll discover more.  Yet the actual differences between these units are slight and difficult to puzzle out.  Oftentimes, not even the unit's name is changed between two incarnations.  Some stats are byzantine and presented in great detail while I was never able to find other, more important statistics like size.\n\nSo how do you play D4 well?  Part of it is via an encyclopediac knowledge of the game system.  And a large part of that is through watching presentations of battles.  With each battle, you're supposed to see how the system works.  These battles are repetitive, barely more dynamic than damage numbers floating from people's heads, and painfully slow to watch.  Yet you're not going to get good at D4 without watching a great number of these.  D4's tactical system combines the interactivity of autoresolve with the mind-numbing tedium of watching grass grow.\n\nThe problems in D4's design are compounded by graphics that would be appropriate to the 486 era and interface issues.  There isn't much to say about the graphics beyond the fact that they're bad, but I can talk about the interface issues.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is that D4 decided to go its own way with regards to standards set by other strategy games in regards to rmb/lmb role, and for no apparent reason.  This is frustrating, particularly since the interface will easily cancel your orders anytime you get it wrong, without any warning.  Still, one can adapt.  Heroes frequently decide to stop doing what you told them to, so you're going to have to babysit them, but the only way I found to check on my heroes wasn't with a hotkey nor a button, nor a menu, but a submenu.  If you can't do something right now, the game isn't going to tell you that it can be done, and definitely not why you can't do it right now, although there's little consistency to this-- there are exceptions.  Winning battles is all about understanding unit capabilities (remember how many there are), yet the vision/intelligence system gives you no way to check these units' statistics until you actually fight.  Can your forty troglodytes take on the three winged bathyor?  There is no way to find out beyond trying.  Overall, you have a game that absorbs a lot of attention in small, unimportant details while the really important things are never presented with the weight they deserve.\n\nI haven't fully explored the depths of Dominions 4.  There may very well be parts of an interesting game buried underneath there.  What is clear is that it would take me several hundred hours to be able to find out whether D4 is even worth playing, and that even then, problems with interface, presentation, and balance would remain.  I can't recommend this game, not when so many superior choices, in the same genre, at the same price, exist.","January 10","false","535.5"," 34 of 54 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","34","54","5","10"

In this way Dominions 4 has an awesome RPG system, your commanders got stats and traits that affect a lot of things, not only their attributes. For example, there's an item for Ermor that allows my commander to summon 3 lictors for the price of one if I have it equipped. Some items let your armies and commander travel under water or fly.

Build your own empire bonuses and leader/god (lower case) to meet your style of play.\n3)Huge variety of units, spells, and gear to give your generals!  You can hire, research, or smith to your heart's content, getting immersed in the RPG-style character management, the tactical setup, or the strategic conquest!\n4)4X style game that allows for massive multiplayer engagements without feeling cumbersome.  Team up with your friends to take on as many CPU enemies as you like, or crush them as well.  Setup is very customizeable and there are different game modes and victory conditions to meet.\n5)What other game lets you equip a water-breathing amulet and ambush your foes with a hand-picked team of crack troops lead by a Titan from the sea they thought you couldn't cross?\n\nThis game has serious depth, but can be adequately played and enjoyed whilst learning it.  AI difficulty can be tweaked, numbers can be adjusted, and the sheer number of races split over 3 different ages (each has an iteration in one of 3 time periods, evolving to meet the slow loss of magical presence in the world), make for a game that has endless replayability and is quite accessible.\n\nDo not let the graphics fool you, the gameplay is top-notch 4X gold that has been refined over 3 sequels.  A welcome addition to any gamer's collection.  Recommended if you like 4X games, turn-based strategy, HoMM, King's Bounty, or like games that have depth worthy of investigating, should you pursue them.","August 13, 2014","true","5.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

It allows for incredibly in-depth strategy with a large variety of interesting factions and mechanics. Only in Dominons 4 can you sacrifice a bunch of blood slaves in an attempt to crossbreed the ultimate warrior. 10/10.\n\nUpdate: I recently had an epic experience that I posted on the discussion board, and people said I should at it as a review. So here it is.\n\nHow Heroes are Made\nEarlier tonight, one of the most epic occurences I have ever seen in a video game occured. Seeing that as a sign of a good game and also worth telling about, I decided to post here for your reading pleasure. Since it is only due to a confusing chain of events that this occured, I'm going to tell the full story from start to finish. Enjoy.\n\nRecently I started a MA game with my friend. It was Agartha and Pangea (me and my friend) up against 6 other pairs ( Ermor and Arcosephale, Ashdod and Nazca, Tien Chi and Caelum, Eriu and Ulm, Asphodel and Vanarus, Sceleria and Man ). Settings were for a long enjoyable coop game against the AI, with story events, conquest all, clustered spawns, and common random events. To start, we are luckily positioned with the one sea as our northern border ( the map had full wraparound), and mountains close by. We expand quickly and have a nice lump of land before we begin having conflicts with our neighbors, Ermor to the west and Ashdod/Nazca to the south. Im forced to support my Pangean friend with large blocks of Agarthan infantry supported with living statues so we can push back the enemies to the south. During the delay, Ermor casts a global enchantment, Burden of Time. Realizing the issues with all of our units dying of old age, we immediatly leave a small border garrison and charge our resources at Ermor. The endless legion combined with the death 3 provinces causes massive attrition, wearing our armies down to nothing and resulting in the deaths of my top commanders, excpet for one, Ernst, the Cave Captain. He has already aged to 45 / 50 from the Global Enchantment, so I prepare a suicide battalion of my remaining elderly units to rush Ermor and slay their god to end the enchantment. In a long battle across Ermor, I manage to corner and kill him in their capital. In the mean time, I've also rushed my way into Blood Magic to unlock Boots of Youth, which Ernst gets at the ripe age of 49, 1 year before old age. The Encantment is dispelled, but most players without undead focus have been crippled from its effects. My researchers are all diseased and my armies crippled. Ernst and only a few other commanders were given boots in time, the rest being too wounded to salvage. I recruit new generals, one of which being Aripert. The game is peacful for a time, but soon Ashopdel begins attacking. Im ready. Aripert and Ernst lead a combined force of over 400 Agarthan infantry, supported by foul spawn and living statues. Ashopdel is crushed, but their ally Vanarus pushes me back, killing most of my army. My commanders retreat, and I get a story event at my capital. A band of adventurers has joined the cause. I put them to good use as supporting commanders and mages for Aripert and Ernst. I launch a new attack at Ashopdel and Vanarus, killing the former and sieging the latter. My ally in the meantime has been fighting the war from the opposite side, and we meet together at Vanarus's capital. I storm first, Ernst, Aripert, and adveturers as commanders, a a vangaurd of Agarthan Living Statues in the front, foul spawn on the flanks, and Agarthan infantry in the core. The battle is brutal, with the archer towers killing 2 of my 6 adventurers, and my force being hit with many spells. Inside the fort is Vanarus' God, the Son of Fenrir. My own commanders have reached hall of fame status with 4 EXP and a heroic ability each. The battle rages, and I notice the adventures have been casting Nature 2 spells Enlarge and Enrage on my commanders. Suddenly, my small Cave Captains Ernst and Aripert have turned into size 4 killing machines, but are unable to get into combat. Eventually, morale breaks in both sides, and the mages run off the fields. My statues and the enemy elementals collapse into dust, leaving our core infantry to fight. The Son of Fenrir enters combat with his wolves, decimating my men while their men are whittled away by my more tanky infantry. The core infantry of their side routes, but mine route aswell after slaying the wolve body guards of their pretender god. All thats left are Ernst and Aripert, leading the charge alone. Against a god. With 200 hp. and Regen. I prepare for the worst, and to my astonishment Ernst strikes their god down with his enchanted Sword of Swiftness, with Aripert supporting. Vanarus was knocked out of the game, and a basic Cave Captain recruiting for a suicide mission many years ago had slain a god.","March 6","true","60.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

It's all based around huge-scale single wars with the goal of becoming chief God, in single or multiplayer, that just escalate in scale as they go on. What starts with armies of dozens stabbing with swords and flinging basic magic spells like flickers of fire soon escalates into hundreds and thousands of troops clashing, with mythical beasts of various origins roaring and rampaging as ancient wizards call down great storms that rock nations.\n\nThe gameplay involves managing your nation. After designing your pretender God you choose what to recruit with recruitables divided between normal troops and commanders who can control different amounts of troops. It's a little more complicated with that but the game is easy to pick up. You then direct your commanders across a world map, taking over, reinforcing and just conquering the whole damn world.\n\nThere is a lot of variety in what you can play and how you can play. You choose from playing in the early ages, middle ages or late ages. The later the setting, the less magic there is in the world but the more advanced technology is. Playable nations come from a huge variety of influences. Some are historical, some mythological, some fictional and others more original. Only in this game can you play Three Kingdoms-era China battling a Lovecraftian army of horrors.\n\nOverall, it's a very deep game but easy to pick up, with tons of content that any strategy fan should pick up!","August 27, 2014","true","112.3"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","24","39","0","1"

In short, gameplay is excellent while the graphic/music is really bad in the year 2014. The current US$35 price is a bit too much so I would highly recommend it during a sales.\n\nGameplay:\nFirst of all, there are so many nations to be chosen from. For example, in "Early Age" setting, there are currently ("currently" because the Dev just added one new nation in a Nov 2014 patch) 29 nations each with different troops (some nations share the same troops because of the fantacy setting) and starting magic strength. As for magic, there are 8 types in total (Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Nature, Death, Astral, and Blood) while the research for spells are divided by schools instead of type (except for "Blood", which is both a school and type of magic) so that you can't really too concentrate your research on one school while ignoring the others.\n\nAs for buildings, there are only a few; I guess the Dev want you to spend gold on troops than fancy buildings.\n\nLast but not least, there are hereos for each nation and generic heroes to be summoned by spells. When there are heroes available, you certainly want to equip them with fancy equipments... and yes... there are so many you can build as long as you have researched the magic school level and the magic resources. Although they are called "Heroes", they aren't invincible even if they have reached a high experience level or even if you teach them very high magic level. It is because experience only adds small increment to their combat skills while high magic level requires substantial investment and casting stronger magic creates alot more fatique (high fatique can kill them) to the hero. Further, you can't exactly revive heroes in Dominions 4, you can only bring them back as "mummy" which is a undead hero.\n\nIf you want to check how many nations, spells, or equipments, you can read the manual from its official website.\n\nGraphic/music:\nThe graphic is really 2008 and there are only like 4 or 5 music in the game.

In the game you control a pretender god and its respective nation of worshipers. Various thrones of ascension exist (based on how you configure the scenario) in different locations around the world map. By claiming enough thrones before the other pretender gods you can attain victory. Each nation has its own units, pretender gods, priest units, magical units and traits. Want to be a Cthulu-esque monstrosity which ushers its amphibious armies from the depths? Do it! Want to be a peace loving and fair deity skilled in the magics of nature? You got it! Forge magical items for your generals and prophets? Spread your dominion to all corners of the globe? Do you want to conduct sacrifices for different benefits? All of these things and more are possible. The game is not perfect, however, as the graphics are dated. And that is being very generous with my wording. I, however, with a deep love of grand strategy and fantasy have found the hours I've explored this game to be quite rewarding. If you enjoy grand strategy and are willing to invest time in swinging through a slightly steep learning curve then don't pass up this hidden gem. And, as always, support games that are more than just products. They are art! Cheers and good luck on your path to godhood!\n\nEDIT: I also wanted to highly recommend the map entitled "Valanis."

No two nations play alike and even within the nations there are many ways to play.\n\nMy favorite nation is known as Ermor, it's a romanesque nation which as it progresses through the ages it becomes undead. In the early ages you have great armies marching under royal banners, formation fighting with towershields, being supported in the back by toga-wearing wizards. In the middle ages the empire falls and rises again as undead. The rotting legions rise from the grave and march out of the capitol to ravage the countryside. In Ermor's undead regions, everything slowly dies due to the power of the Ermor god, so most Ermorian regions end up with 0 population.

Each nation has their own interesting history based on the dominions world and aren't just a fantasy ripoff of orcs, elves, etc.  There's an incredibly deep magic system with over 800 spells, 300 forgeable magic items and over 2000 units!  You can play single player, hotseat, play by email or multiplayer with up to 28 players including team games.  The game is also easily moddable and there's a big mod community.    With this many nations, spells, and units, this game is very complex and impossible to fully master.  It's an old school style game where you should actually read the manual (infact dominions 3 came with a 400 page manual).  This game is an acquired taste for the patient who enjoy gameplay over good graphics.  If you're a tabletop wargamer or enjoy the civ series you might like this. The graphics are sprite based but functional and the music is good. If you're on the fence about this game, Dominions 3 (which is similiar) has a free demo available for download.

The civilizations available have been expanded, and an option for team play has been introduced with the Disciple mechanic. A word to the wise, this is a deep game with a steep learning curve and a lot of subtle mechanics which strongly effect gameplay.

It definitely has one of the most steep learning-curves I've seen in the various games I played, and even when the mechanics have been mastered, the possible strategies that can be adopted in the game are almost endless.\n\nThe lore of this game is set in a fantasy world taking inspiration from mithology and legends across the whole world.\n\nConcerning the game, Dominions is a turn based wargame with deep mechanics, allowing the players to play the different factions (there are many and all different) in various ways, even the same faction can be played using different strategies, and often there is no clear superior strategy, so it is up to the player to decide which one to adopt and how to adapt it to the evolving game. Dominions 4 is not only about grand strategy but also about tactical decisions, since the player will have to decide its armies formations and somehow how they are going to approach the eventual upcoming battle(s) the coming turn, along with decinding which spells the mages in the armies are going to cast, allowing in this way to create powerful combos.\n\nTo conclude this short review I would like to point out that Dominions 4 is not "The perfect game". But to do so I need to elaborate a little bit: I personally think that Dominions 4 is "the perfect game" for what it is supposed to be, a very deep slow paced niche strategy game requiring lot of thinking every turn and even before the game to select the strategy to adopt (I'm saying slow paced since during endgames, turns can take two or more hours, especially on big maps). However the game is not for everyone. Given it's depth, the only proper way to play it is multiplayer, even if the game allows the player to play against AIs, as to be expected due to the game complexity, they do not represent a challeng to a player who learnt the mechanics and has some experience with the game.\n\nFinally, if you are interested in a challenging turn based game and you don't mind spending time in learning it and play it against other players (the community has been usually quite friendly and willing to help newcomers), then pick it up and give it a try, I am pretty sure you will be happily surprised by this odd-looking game ;)","December 31, 2015","true","85.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aurumlamina/recommended/259060/","aurumlamina","Aurumlamina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aurumlamina/","1108 products in account","A strategy game with some of the deepest and most interesting lore that I have ever experienced in gaming, Dominions 4 is a game that is both complicated and simple at the same time.  The individual details on the lore of each faction and its units is incredible, while the gameplay itself is significantly less deep.  However, you are a Pretender God, a being of great power with ambitions to ascend to ultimate, monotheistic godhood over his or her rivals.  So there's that for you powermongers out there.\n\nWhen starting your game there are three separate eras that you can play your campaign in.  Each of these eras is packed full of at least a dozen factions that are unique from one another.  Often this means that each era introduces entirely new factions as well as a good number of them that are evolved from the previous ones.  For example, my personal favorite, Ulm, is a faction composed large, human barbarians that worship steel in the Early Ages.  In the Middle Ages, they have evolved into a civilization that has mastered the art of crafting with the legendary resource known as blacksteel.  They now have armies full of black knights clad in this fantastic metal and are the most powerful rank-and-file infantry in the era.  In the Late Ages, however, civil war has destroyed what they once were and the secrets of blacksteel have been lost.  Though their troops are know wearing more standard armor, their aristocracy has become corrupted by vampirism.  This is but one of the many examples of a faction's evolution and some of them even have branching factions such as an empire that becomes three unique kingdoms.\n\nThe strategy mechanics of Dominions 4 are not particularly remarkable, however, supplemented with the vast lore, they do make for a very enjoyable game.  Each faction has a fairly large number of units to build their armies with that have varying strength, weaknesses, special abilities, and a handful of stats.  As you conquer territories, you will also be able to recruit units not originally from your faction's unit pool.  This can result in some wonderfully unique armies that you conquer the world with.\n\nThough the lore in the game is fantastic, I do believe players should be aware before playing the game that after starting your campaign there is nothing much that is added to it.  There are exciting random events and, obviously, your conquest of the world will vary every time, but the story from the time you hit the 'play' button is all headcanon.  Granted, that is often the best canon, especially when shared with others.\n\nI recommend this game to strategy gamers, especially, as long as they don't mind the ancient graphics.  If you enjoy well written and unique lore and aren't expecting flashy, cinematic battles to play out before your eyes, Dominions 4 will be an experience that you'll come back to and share with others for a long, long time.","January 20","true","10.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There aren't too many games in which you can raise a Hydra, magically give it the ability to lead troops, and then make him the prophet of your faith; or to take a Hoburg (think Hobbit...), give him a magical item that makes him larger, and then give him boots to (literally) walk all over his enemies.    Or, say, for irony's sake summon an a powerful angel and equip him with weapons and armor gained only with the extensive sacrifice of virgins... if you want to play a drunk, demented (or both) god, this might amuse you.  I find outlandish prophets and strangely geared units funny, and I'd rather drink instead of methodically optimize my research and armies, so this is what I tend to do.\n\nIf you'd rather play it straight and less goofy, and you want competent opponents, then there's the multiplayer mode -- either via PBEM, or with one player hosting a server.\n\nWhile the game doesn't support Workshop mode, it's quite moddable (sprites and text files) when it comes to adding new units or factions or modifying existing ones.  If you and your friends think that some spells are completely unacceptable, you could mod the game to make them inaccessible.   Too cheap units could be made more expensive.  And so forth.  Heck, if you wanted everybody to start with a single-use unit named "Nuclear Missile" that could teleport 10 provinces away and cast a kill-everything-on-battlefield spell but would vaporize after its first battle, you could -- you'd need to define the slay-all spell (presumably called "Explode" or "DEFCON 1"), create a unit with desired stats and a trait that makes it die after a battle, and rig it to autocast the spell when battle starts; and then you'd mod the starting forces for each faction to include the missile unit.

AND being able to outfit your commanders with a bunch of different magic items.\n\nBefore you go and say "wow this sounds great" I'm gonna say this:  This game is for autistic people, you know the kind that unironically play untranslated MMOs or games like EVE. For ♥♥♥♥s sake to do the tutorial you have to download the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ manual jesus christ Its like I'm in the 80s/90s again.\n\nThe graphics and UI are absolute trash, I understand there are only 2 crazy probably eastern european devs working on this game but this is the fourth one in the series, hire a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphic designer.\n\nSo, why do I reccomend this game? It's kinda cool. There's a bunch of different nations spanning three different eras so you're bound to find one that appeals to your favorite mythologies, and then you get to create a pretender god to stomp all over the enemy nations. You can  be a dragon, titan, gorgon, or maybe you're a bit more laid back and want to be a giant stone statue, you can do that too, oh laugh while you still can, because when you're able to bless your army with flaming arrows and regeneration watcha gonna do then.\n\nThe game gets a little crazy, like there's a global enchantment that starts making everyone age at a crazy rate. Well some shmuck just cast that spell and he's sitting behind 5500 power liches so what are you gonna do? You're gonna get a ninja and build your most crazy magic items and twink this 50 gold character like a god, and then you're gonna have him sneak into the undead providence and hope that he finds the right mage to murder♥♥♥♥. Let's say you've got lucky and found the mage, well turns out he was a crafty ♥♥♥♥er and had a teleport spell set to autocast, so now he's 10 providences away in another TOWN, but that's keikaku doori because now he's in range for your astral mages in your town to literally mind ♥♥♥♥ this guy TO DEATH.\n\nAlso you can play as r'yleh and take over the world with an army of insane gibbering madmen led by mind flayers.\n\n\n","July 13, 2014","true","347.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","2"

Lovecraft. You start out the game by choosing a map, age, empire, and then making a god. The game consists of three playable ages that show the development of the playable empires. The early ages have Magical and Nonhuman factions in abundance, while the human factions of the time are just discovering bronze Copper and Bronze. This age also has the greatest amount of Magic, but also the least organised casters. The second age is marked with Human factions beggining to subjigate the assorted nonhumans with weapons of Iron and Steel augmented by enchantment. This age has a moderate balance of Magic and Organised casters. The Third age is a time were Man has all but destroyed the magical wonders of past ages. Magic is nearly drained from the world, but well organised wizards make do with what is left. After you choose your age, you choose your empire, Then make your God. Your God making sets how you will spend the next several hours of your life in this game. You select an available Deity for your faction, then get to choosing how strong it is in magic and what bonuses you get in lands were you are believed in. Say you're faction has very good yet expensive troops, yet poor magical researchers and practitioners so you can't get any late game spells, you would make your god have a dominion that boosts production and can cast what you need to be cast. FINALLY you are in the game after setting a few end game goals and options, and the real complicated hell begins. I think im going to stop soon so I am going to make this as simple as possible to summarise what you do in the actual game. Your first play through will just be throwing bodies at other bodies till you win or lose. Though what makes the game fun is the magic. One magician with some magical items and gems can single handedly destroy a quarter of an army, but what makes it complicated is knowing the exact stats of those items, spells, and how much your caster can take before fainting. I think this is way to long already and if anybody reads this far then I'm sorry if this was a mess. If you want to take the time to learn about this game and such then by all means get it.","February 19","true","91.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Every faction is different - and I mean different not just cosmetically, but to the very essence. To give an example to show the contrast between the factions:\n\nLate Age Agartha is a nation of cave-dwellers. Their version of cavalry rides cave drakes, their mages are skilled in earth and death magic. They also recieve a bonus to alchemy. Their best soldiers require a large amount of resources to produce. Since most of their soldiers have darkvision or are already blind, they don't get harmed from spells like Solar Eclipse and Darkness.\n\nLate Age Lemuria is a land of the Undead (it's basically a fantasy counterpart of Ancient Rome which gets corrupted). The extent of your pretender god's dominion will always kill off the populace in provinces. You then use these dead bodies to bolster your army with spectral centurions, velites, and consuls  - not through training, but through summoning with spells. Thus, you have little use for gold or resources.\n---\nThere are also many Pretender Gods to choose from. From a mere sculpture that has gained power through millenia of worship, to a divine burning glyph, from a titan of the sea, to a dragon. You can further customize your pretender by changing the effects of its dominion (the extent of its power), and its capabilities in magic.\n\nUnits differ wildly. Some are only recruitable in some regions, most are only available to a single nation. They have tons of attributes, a stat sheet, and commander/spellcaster/scout/priest units have an inventory for items.\n\nThe graphics are a bit of a shame, it's true. Most of the time, you won't even watch the battle replays, the random map generator creates ugly looking maps. However, the userbase (and potentially you will too), have created some lovely looking maps, worthy of Tolkien himself.\n\nThe gameplay is very complex. I don't like Let's Play videos, so I had to learn by myself. You'll need a bit of patience, some intuition, and curiosity to understand fully how it works.\n\nBut here's why this game is really worth playing: The storytelling.\nThe richness of the world and its backstory will pull you in. Every single unit type has a story. Every "hero" type character has the potential to be your favourite character in the game.\nYou will spend astral magic gems, month after month, empowering Sybil - your Oracle fountain pretender goddess. And you will craft the most powerful of items, to arm Eteonos - a 54 year old Strategos. Eteonos is 54 years old. His best years should be behind him, but he still fights with the vigour and heart of a young hoplite. A shaman you've recruited helped you put a spell over your dominion - where creatures of all kinds age slowly and every wound heals given time, even a lost eye or limb. Eteonos's stiffening joints move with ease, his reflexes and strength are active as ever. You don him with the arms and armor of the Warrior of Dawn, and you send him to the Arena, to fight other champions on your behalf, to bring honour on to your name, and win the prized Champion's Helmet.\nWill he succeed? Wİll he fail? Who knows. What matters is your brain weaves together a story, and that story enhances the game greatly.","June 10, 2015","true","95.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game has 3 campaigns for 3 different periods of "history". early middle and late. now for every one of those periods 'and here's the onion' you get to choose from tens of different of earth-based mythological factions. but imagine every mythology there is. the work that has been done to faction differences -imagine in the early period viking mythological based factions are 4, you have african based, aztec based, ancient greek, roman, celtic, EVEN 'RLYEH or other underwater nations, japanese bakemonos, hollow earth golems, undead hordes, there is no end to the differet cultural and mythological factions in the game- it is simply amazing. you get to choose your god, and start your empire, research A LOT and powerfull spells, create unique magical items to put on your commanders, customize your armies and their behaviour in combat ect ect. no ORC VS HUMAN VS DWARVES here. whenever you're from there is a faction that has elements from your culture.\nthe music is amazing traditional swedish with bagpipes ect. icould go on and on and on, so i will end with this.\n\nThis is the way total war should have been, this is the strategy that leaves you to guide your nations with absolute freedom. this is the game that some turn-based freaks like me should have been playing 10 years ago when the franchise begun.\nWHY DO YOU NOT OWN THIS??\n\nEdit after latest patches: Game gets updates with bugfixes and new nations as we speak, it never gets old after a year playing it. Still the best strategy game in time and space.","July 17, 2014","true","209.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I played as R'lyeh (named for the city in which Cthulhu lies in deathless dreams) and zerg rushed everything unfortunate enough to be underwater. Then I turned my attention to the land. This is difficult as R'lyeh, as most units available to it can only survive underwater or with costly magic to allow them to breathe air or transport them in a bubble of water, and my enemies had fortified the coast at this point. So instead of raiding their ports the traditional way I summoned a bunch of sea trolls, which can survive both on land and underwater, and had them repeatedly throw themselves into suicide missions along a coastal region until the area was strewn with corpses. Then I marched the Eater of the Dead, a massive undead horror summoned from a nether realm that feeds on corpses to grow in power until it inevitably becomes too powerful for its summoner to control and breaks free, wreaking havoc indiscriminately, over to the battlefield and had it gorge itself. It broke free quickly and began rampaging, but this was all according to plan- I cast a spell to freeze the oceans over, so it could not get back down to my oceanic empire, yet was free to destroy all unfortunate enough to live above sea level. Sadly, I did not comprehend the importance of proselatyzing, so belief in me gradually ran out throughout the empire, until I had no divine dominion left and lost anyway.\n\nSince then I have played as the lavamen of Abysia and created a second sun so there was eternal burning day, crippling the offencive of my cold-loving Niefelheim foes; As the Ashen Empire of Ermor, an undead post-apocalyptic Roman empire that spreads like an infection, turning the world into skeletons, and did the opposite, blotting out the sun and causing the entire world to age at an incredible rate (skeletons have great longevity, humans not so much); As Kailasa, an Indian-themed realm of reincarnating monkey gurus, I used the power of the stars to transform a demigod of mercy into a ruthless and indiscriminate killing machine, flying around the world with a shapeshifting dragon princess she once saved in tow and bringing destruction upon my enemies; As the amphibious subterranean civilisation of Agartha I broke an ancient seal, releasing mad gods upon the world; And so on- These are only the more prominent examples, stories many players are likely to experience because they align with each nation's strengths and lore.\n\nMake no mistake, Dominions is only superficially yet another army-management turn-based wargame. In fact it is more of a game about great magical beings at war with each other, and the havoc they wreak in their strife for supremacy. Like certain other absurdly complex modern CRPGs with minimalistic graphics (the most prominent being Dwarf Fortress), Dominions has decent gameplay, but its real strength is in its equally complex and convoluted lore and the intriguing stories that come from it.\n\nOne of my favourite games, strongly recommend.","July 14, 2015","true","381.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

And not just the western mythology stuff you've seen a million times either. You can summon a winged monkey-demon that wants to "gobble up the sun and plunge the world into an eternal slumber". He plunges the entire battlefield into darkness whenever he shows up. You can rain sacred flying jaguar demons on your enemies, free titans trapped in tartarus and nurse them back to health, and literally cause a zombie apocalypse. I've got a weakness for this kind of stuff, but the game is large enough you're bound to find a nation that appeals to you.\n\nNot to say the game is without problems. The game's breadth makes it almost inaccessible, and as a game goes on, it increases your workload of fiddly micromanagement. Want to find errands for 30 wizards every turn? Dominions is the game for you. The game's mechanics are unnecessarily complex, and incompletely described in the long manual. The AI is almost non-existent, mostly useful for testing out tactics on the most basic level. The game is not especially balanced, and there are some awkward results of the game's committment to mythological versimilitude. (Women, across the board, have 1 less point of strength than men of the same group. Mechanically, this is largely insignificant, but it is still stupid.)\n\nThese problems are significant, and if you aren't entranced by Dominions 4's unique qualities, I don't recommend it.

It might even be the king of fantasy strategy games.\n\nDominions 4 has incredibly deep mechanics that will, truthfuly, be quite frustrating at times but are also incredibly rewarding. This is a game where you invest alot of time into to fully understand. Every time you play you figure out a new strategy or mechanics you didnt know about. At the time of writing this review I have 274 hours into this game and I'm still learning. You can put a hundred hours into one nation and still not unlock its full potential. If you arn't willing to put time into this game you will only leave frustrated. Luckily there is a very active and incredibly helpful community over at Desura.com.\n\nPlaying this game you will raise vast armies filled with simple human warriors, incredibly strong giants, magic demi gods, demons, angels, half fish men, dragons and many more creatures. You'll have armies of hundreds of units battling eachother as mages set the battlefield afire and call upon divine lightning to destroy their foes while corrupt priests cast unholy rituals by spilling virgin blood. You'll have a unstoppable army conquering and pillaging your enemies lands but then your opponent summons a powerful hero, hundreds of years old, from ancients crypts in his home city. This hero will fight your unstoppable army. One man, versus hundreds. And he'll win. You'll have a crippled commander who can barely move. Old in his age and speaking in croaks and whispers. but all your men respect him because he is a master tacticitan, he has never been defeated in battle. Guarded by your most trusted men he commands huge armies and crushes enemy forces with ease.\n\nThe modding is where this game truly shines. Their are hundreds of mods available that change every aspect you could possibly imagine. From mods that balance to mods that are simply for fun, there is dozens of mods for every kind of player. If you're feeling brave you can mod yourself, all you need is a text and image editing program, with a official modding manual available at Illwinter's website. You can create any nation or creature you can think of. Want to play as a nation of cannabilistic, necromatic hobbit warrior society, go ahead, easily done. create as many and whatever spells you want. This game is your playground.\n\nThe setting isnt simply your standard high fantasy theme but taken from legends and myths from around the world and throughout history. You're not playing a premade fantasy world, you're creating the world. You write your heroes stories, your own nations history. You are creating the world as you play.\n\n11/10\n\n","January 27","true","275.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Players also screw up entire game strategies, formation tactics, item combinations, and attacking neutral provinces they can't defeat, making player games radically more random than those against the AI.\n\nIf you have a friend who you can play with, you should absolutely try multiplayer, all the same while, if you're playing by yourself, you can take all the time in the world to do whatever you want with your micromanagement and role-play to your heart's content.","January 1","true","145.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I thoroughly recommend this game for those who enjoy turn based strategy games, and D&D players.\n\nThe game features well researched historical nations fighting alongisde their own mythologies, such as Japanese Ashigaru being supported by Tengu, or Viking raiders paired with dragons. These nations are led by your own custom god who radically changes the territory that he/she/it controls, wether by making it into a fertile and well ordered land or turning it into a disease ridden, unproductive region of unrest. Or your god can simply be a towering behemoth that smashes its opponents to pieces in battle. Both methods are completly viable. The final component is the deep magic system, with apocalyptically powerful spells and summonable creatures divided into different schools. Some nations have excellent soldiers but terrible mages, and vice versa. It is very rewarding to create your own deadly combinations of different nations, gods and magics; the amount of combinations is staggering. The game is still updated fairly often bringing more nations to the increasingly large roster. Furthermore, there are many mods to keep adding content to the game.\n\nHowever, the game can be rather intimidating with a frankly inadequate tutorial, making a read of the manual essential. I had to lose several games before even starting to understand what was going on, and I'm still pretty bad at it. The graphics are certainly functional but they are not exactly good either. In singleplayer there really is no diplomacy to speak of, you are constantly at war with the other players - I think that the lack of diplomacy is the biggest issue the game has.\n\nUltimately, Dominions 4 is a great game that I greatly enjoy playing.","June 12, 2015","true","95.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The content of the game is just huge, there are hundreds of units, spells and ways to play the game and win. The learning curve is therefore a bit slow and you will need a good while until you can play really effectively, but even while you have to learn, the game is much fun. There's also tons of lore behind all the different nations you can play, which people with imagination might enjoy as well. And the best thing is that this game is still regularly being updated, with new units, nations and gods to play as.

These scales also determine bless amounts which are bonuses given to holy units, which each nation has.\n\nThere is also Dominion which given it shares the name with the game is one of the most important aspects. Dominion is the Pretender God's influence, without it your God will die and you will be subjected to other Gods dominion which brings a morale detriment for you and a postive boost for morale for your enemies.\n\nYou can take negative dominions traits like chaos or death or positive ones like magic or growth. Depending on the nation some will be postive for some while harmful to others, for example MA Ulm benefits from drain and Ermor benefits from Death.\n\nWinning conditions can be point based, deathmatch or my favorite Thrones of Ascension which are thrones of varying power that have an effect on provinces, dominion and gems.\n\nMagic is fueld by Gems and much be researched to be usable.\nSome spells require no gems but only effect Fatigue while others do. There are spells which have in battle effect and spells which can be used on the map to summon units, or attack provinces.\n\n----------------Setting----------------------\nThe setting of Dominions 4 is amazing, each Nation changes based on the age its in.\nSome dissapear other change dramatically.\nXibalba goes from a nation of Bat people to a nation of Frog people who enslave the Bat people.\nRlyeh goes from a nation of mindfrying fish called Aboleths into Squid people loosely based on Lovercraft who summon horrors from beyond to use as BLESSED units.\n\nSome nations like R'lyeh that I mentioned are sea based as they start in ocean provinces and all units are able to breathe underwater.\n\nNations have diffrent spells which all come with their own flavor text describing the spell and its origins and value to the people who cast it.\n\n----------------Music & Sound-----------------\nDo not expect an epic soundtrack, one song and one song only, that goes on forever.\nSounds are good not great but indicate what is going on and are quite good when using iron blizzard in masse and hearing enemy splat noises.\n\n-------------------Maps------------------------\nThe game comes packaged with quite a few high quality maps, there is also the ability to make random maps however they don't look the greatest.\n\nHowever the game does have a very simplified map creation tool, and quite a few maps have been made for DOM 4 or converted from Dom 3.\n\nOne of my favorite maps is called Valanis and is quite beautiful visually and mechanically.\n\n----------------------Performance----------------------\nThe performance is sex.\nOn a crappy lenova laptop which I use for work mainly is able to run the game and with most graphical options turned off can simulate very large battles which is impressive seeing as my laptop lacks a seperate video card.\n\nMy rig at home is a monster but even with a toaster with mild specs the game will run wonderfully.\nOne of the best aspects of the game as I enjoy being able to take my work laptop up with me on trips and being able to play the game without lugging my Tower around with me.\n\n\nI highly recommend Dominions 4 for anyone looking for a great Tactics and Strategy game with a fantasy flair.\n\n","March 24","true","338.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

If you can get past a confusing UI and sprite graphics, you'll find a wonderfully complicated and strategic game that is also filled to the brim with competing mythologies in pursuit to rule over a world.\n\nA world that will likely be destroyed by the time you get there because you won by sacrificing thousands of virgins to summon horrors from beyond the veil to consume friend and foe alike!\n\nAnd that's just one of many viable strategies to win! You can also create massive communions of mages that use its weaker members' energy as fuel to power the rest into throwing out massive firestorms upon the enemy's heads. Or you can air-drop hundreds of magical elves riding ponies into every enemy province at the same time. Or even have your pretender god wish himself physical and magical mastery until no being in existance can stand up to the sheer power.\n\nThis is, through and through, a multiplayer game. Although there is single player which can be useful for trying out certain things, the focus is on playing the game with others. Communities for Dominions 4 multiplayer can be found on Desura's Dominions 4 forum, on dom4mods, and on Something Awful. I'm sure there are other communities as well.

It's one of the rare games where fantasy China, fantasy Scandinavia, fantasy Egypt, fantasy Maya, and fantasy Celts can all fight and all feel like their own unique nation, with assorted strengths, weaknesses, and an incredibly detailed lore.\nStepwise from 3, the game is not a huge change, but there's a lot more than modding can do and a great deal of changes that offer new avenues for balance. If you liked 3, you'd like 4 but might want to wait for a sale to make the jump.","December 8, 2013","true","218.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

This will run on almost any machine and the play by email multiplayer works really well for people with spotty internet connections.\n\nYou start every game by picking a nation that decides the type of mages and troops you can recruit, and then you choose and customize a god to lead your nation. I beleve there are over a hundred gods to choose from, including (but not limited to) Greek, Norse, Celtic, German, Sumerian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian and even Cthulhu-esque. There's everything from an erstaz Athena to a disembodied head with crab claws coming out of its forhead.\n\nWhile the myriad of rules can seem intimidating, most people should be able to jump in and play against the computer without too much difficulty. Once you get a feel for the rules there are a few communities that regularly run blitz matches so you aren't stuck committing months of your time to a long PBEM.","December 25, 2014","true","260.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I wasn't expecting much from this game as I've bounced from 4x to wargames, and back again over time never really being that impressed. So let me write a quick love letter to this one, that I've been hopelessly addicted to over the past several days despite its flaws.\n\nThis game does not compromise on what it's supposed to be. It's a lovesong to the heydey of the past, and it's built without regard to any mosquito-like whining of the modern age. It never adapted except maybe to make controls easier, and it's so easy to love for it's somewhat rustic charm. If you played this sort of game in 1998, you will be well at home here.\n\nIt treats graphics as though they were petty things for lesser purveyors of the arts. Instead, each and every facet of the game is just rich with an 11 herbs-and-spices of flavor. Every "pretender" God is interesting to read about, as is each civilization. As far as I can tell, they're all derived from one collection of lore or another, but they're adapted in such a way as to be interesting. Do you want biblical fanfiction? Norse mythology? The Deku tree? There's something for everyone here, and none of it is compromised to plebs that tend to fill modern video game audiences.\n\nLet me also mention the depth here. This game is so incredibly deep that many complain about it. As a caveat, the depth may not be entirely perfectly crafted. I feel there are some imbalances between the value of units, and the sheer amounts of spells makes it unreasonable to have a good grasp on what any given casters capabilities are. However, I kind of enjoy the "fog of war" this creates, and as my group of bros got this on sale, we're all kind of on the same curve.\n\nDO BE AWARE. There are a LOT of things in this game that are never explicitly explained, and I absolutely recommend looking up a guide. I watched the first 5 videos in this guy's guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgp1s16zUFA\n\nThings like garrisons, prophets, many facets of casting, even just creating your nation are not obvious or intuitive. You can totally crap your way through it, but it'd be easy to go a few hours and still be missing things.\n\n(on a side note, there are no dedicated servers, you have to use a VLAN with port access, however it has been the most seamless experience I think I've ever had with this system, even flawlessly connecting overseas)\n\nMultiplayer aside, this game is really great on single player as well. I pretty much immediately put in several hours.\n\nThere's just so much meat here, and the meat is delicious. I havn't had such a boner for a game in quite some time. So please accept my full-bellied sloppy ♥♥♥♥♥-soaked recommendation. Time to play for a few more hours.","May 21","true","42.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Epic (Battles with a thousand units vs a God. One Survivor), deep, intelligent and growing (new races are still being released in every age). If you're browsing then know it is well worth the price even full price. I've played it twice as long as Skyrim... longer than most of my games library added together. And each game I've played has been different:\nI lead a race of aquatic mind-lords, deep in the ocean. My pretender to the throne of godhood a great Polypal Queen, giving birth to a host of magical beings that swarm the enemy with their writhing tentacles. My massive ancient mind-lords enslave the enemy with a look, curse entire armies and form communions to enhance their power to incredible levels - enslaving entire battlefields and shredding the souls of the enemy.\nI've led a race of winged humanoids that live high in the mountains crafting weapons and armour from magical ice. Summoning back splendid beings from the astral spheres, 'adorable ones' beautiful to behold, too awesome for living men to dare strike.\nI've seen the temptation of power topple empires. Mages suffering the ravages of old age turn to healers and eventually to death magic to be reborn as wight mages, drawing on the power of conquered lizard shaman to blot out the sun and cover the battlefield with a never ending horde of undead warriors. Then in a latter age casting spells that change the entire globe, covering the lands in darkness and advancing the slow decay of time till all is withered and dead.\nI've felt the fear of a horror-mark. A towering giant of a God, multi-armed and terrifying touched by the unspeakable powers. The last act of a doomed race to mark it, a slow, pyrrhic victory. My God, with power beyond reckoning destined to be stalked forever by the creatures that lurk beyond the veil. Each touch from the terrifying apparitions further marking the Great God for the attention of the astral beings until at last... a doom horror, Each name more frightening than the last. The Eater of Gods arrives to feast. My God is no more...\n\nA brilliant game. I could say more, it's worthy of praise. More than a little tough to get into (you'll make lots of mistakes and you need to practice in SP before trying your hand at MP), dated graphically (2D spites, only one artist working on the game) and a little micromanagement heavy (Ok very micromanagement heavy. You can script every mage, every squad, equip every commander and forge every magical item... lots to consider, lots to weigh up and lots of stats if you're into that). But, if none of that puts you off and the thought of summoning hordes of undead, demons, shrimp or cross-bred monstrosities appeals:\n\nBuy it.\nOr stick it on your wish-list and get it when you can afford it.\nPlay a few games.\nGet your friends to all play on a big map with diplomacy, backstabbing and roleplaying. Keep an eye on the little guy, he's probably planning a surgical strike with teleporting golems, gathering blood-slaves to taint the magic of the world to cause all magic but blood to bring the attention of the horrors. Or he may just have had lots of misfortune and be fighting against barbarians, vampires, roaming bands of heroes, blights and plagues and extreme weather. (Could be luck... or it could be that somone doesn't like him very much).\n\nI hope you get it, I'm glad I did.","September 5, 2014","true","253.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sifyu/recommended/259060/","Sifyu","Mr.T","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sifyu/","227 products in account","Perhaps the number of hours I’ve been playing deceives you? Hmm? Well, let me put it bluntly. This game is pretty awesome. It is a strategy game at its core. And in the purest sense, a classical war game involving fantastical creatures and beasts. I refer to it as a war game due to the nature of game play. It is hard-core and classical in that, there is no diplomacy. Pure tactics and strategy is needed to succeed. You make your own diplomacy and essentially create your own story.\n\nA word of warning, this game is far better when played online or with other people. Don't get me wrong. There is a single player aspect but in my personal opinion. The single player aspect against the AI is probably best used as a way of testing your builds, possible tactics and army composition. Yes, there is a very in depth combat system in the game, very much akin to Total war. For better or for worse, you have no control over these clashes (represented by crude graphics combating it out, looks pretty appealing in my opinion), and instead you can script what your troops would do. This makes for a more intense session and allows you to experiment possible tactics. By making battles less hands on (like total war), it enables you to feel more like a proper general :) Each unit has a hand drawn sprite and there are over a dozen nations to pick from (from a selection of three ages). Then there is the pretender creation. That is the best part of the game. To create a pretender ‘god’ that represents you. The number of possibilities that come to creating a god is endless.  You can make a combat oriented super god, or perhaps a more spell oriented support god. Maybe even an immobile stone god that confers perks to your troops. The choice is yours!\nI admire the game. Not just because it is a pure grounded classical war game involving fantasy creatures, gods and what not, but more-so due to the amount of detail put into the game. That is a feat that no game can accomplish (well at least with higher graphics anyway).\n\nPerks\n-Really in depth combat system with a multitude of troop types and nations to pick from.\n-Formation system\n-Pretender Creation\n-Randomised map generation\n-Excellent multiplayer game\n-Mod capabilities\n\nCons\n-Graphics can be a major turn off for a lot of players (especially those who look to graphics as the main factor for enjoying a game)\n-Though battles are very detailed (modelling each individual soldiers move and attack), they are very heavily scripted and despite it following orders. There can be tendencies where some of your units won’t follow orders properly (I understand orders cannot be followed to a point but in some cases, it can be pretty extreme).\n\nSo to conclude, my highlight of the game would have to be the combat mechanics and the pretender system. Some people may dislike not having direct control over battles, but I personally think it makes for a far more strategic game. Not to mention, back in the day, generals would not be able to control their infantry or cavalry directly anyway. Even now, there is a margin of error when it comes to following orders from a higher up. I think that is very well simulated in this game. By letting players script orders, you are almost planning your move from a war room. Not knowing exactly what is going to happen. That is how it should be done :D","April 9, 2014","true","9.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But keep in mind on the first attemps the game is hard even against the "easy" AI. If you don't mind to do your "homework" you are rewarded with endless nations, units and tactical possibilities. Every nation has its own units with custom strengh and weaknesses.\n\nThe game is basicly a board game like Risiko Deluxe in a fantasy setting (magic, devils, vampires... you name it).

It is simply the most intricate, intriguing, and deep fantasy strategy game around. You could play this game a lifetime long and probably still not exhaust the combinations of viable and fun strategies for conquering the world.\n\nSo with that totally unqualified and exuberant approval out of the way, it must also be said that this is one of the most maddening games around, in terms of interface, AI and certain functions. Despite substantial interface improvements in Dominions 4 over the previous version, there remains far too much micromanagement. A few additional tools would greatly assist - like automatic pooling of blood slaves (as happens with gems), automated forwarding of recruits from rear areas, multiple turn path-setting for armies, automated setting of research priorities (ie, research Conjuration 3, than Evocation 4, then Thaumaturgy 1 - without me having to manually adjust each turn). And one thing about movement routines frustrates me constantly - once an enemy army is "behind your lines", so to speak, actually pinning it down to a battle is nearly impossible. You move into the province the enemy army is in, but simultaneously the enemy army moves to a different province, and you're caught in a never-ending game of musical chairs. Even if your army is "faster", or should be faster. I'd love it if there were some more sophisticated move mechanics or orders, like "move to block any enemy army that moves to any adjacent province". And I'd also love more stats. And a less silly AI.

It's a bit like Dota or LoL where you have to know pretty much everything about the game to actually win. Although the game might seem difficult at first, all you really need to do is research spells that your nation excells at and then make sure each army has a few mages to turn the tide of every battle. What caught my attention most about this game is how certain civilizations are based on real life civilizations. For example, Machaka represents Great Zimbabwe, Ermor is Rome, Berytos is ancient Carthage, Tien 'Chi is ancient China, and C'tis is based on ancient Egypt, etc. On another note, you get to rule as a god, how awesome is that!?\n\nThe game gets really addicting after a while and it's a bit hard to put down, although the game is supposed to be multiplayer based, the AI is solid and creates an interesting singleplayer game especially with the new Ascensions game mode. Though the AI is not a good practice tool for Multiplayer, it's mostly a tool for testing pretender chasis and certain spells that catch your eye.

This is not another Civ or HoMM clone; here we have a spell list that makes the tech tree of any 4x game you've played look like a post-it note.  Every single troop and item has a back story and a sprite, and every spell has a counter strategy to a counter strategy whch acts as a counter-counter-counter strategy.\n\nUnfortunately, the learning curve is sharp.  The game comes with a read-along tutorial, but nothing can prepare you for the blistering amount of options you have at your fingertips until you play the game.  A lot of the game is figuring out how your different units can behave, because unlike other games where your troops simply "move, attack, or build a structure" commanders in this game can search for blood sacrifices, preach the word of your god, cast a staggering variety of ritual spells, patrol for spies, assassinate commanders with stealthed heroic squads (I made Brock Samson and some OSI agents) and so much more.  Once you amass a healthy army, troop setup and positioning before battle is also vital.\n\nThe game is also not very pretty.  The only nice thing to say about the UI is that it's functional.  No form here; you're presented with a drop-down list that looks like it came from a primitive spreadsheet document.  The backgrounds are pixelated, and the pictures of the troops look like they came from a 16 bit game, though I actually find that charming.\n\nWhat this game lacks in eye candy, it makes up in strategic depth.  Whether you like min-maxing or discovering new strategies on the fly, the absolutely massive toolkit this game gives players means that there is almost always a new way to screw over your opponents and be screwed yourself.  There are so many ways for players to customize their win conditions and other game settings, though this often feels like an old-school war game where the players have to commit to a solid 3-5 hour chunk of play time (though you don't have to do it all in one go because the game saves everyone's progress).  This game also makes you feel like a real deity with spells that let you do anything from creating a global hurricane, ageing the world's population supernaturally fast, or summoning elder gods to rampage indiscriminately across the continent.  There are just SO MANY ways to build your god, nation, and heroes.\n\nAlso, I would like to say that this is the first game I've played in a long time where I've felt like a proper necromancer.  You're not raising a handful of skeletal minions here, oh no.

Then Dominions 4 is the exact opposite. The map might look simple. The graphics might make this game seem outdated but the sprites are just the skin to an enormous gameplay framework.\n\nGod is dead, and the pretender gods of the world are waging war to determine who is going to be the undisputed god of the realm. You, the player, will customize a pretender god to fight for dominance. The key selling point here is that there is so much diversity to the pretender gods. You can make a vampire lord, a dragon, a immovable monolith (like deadspace) and even Zeus himself if you wanted to.\n\nI suggest picking this game up if you are interested in a good MULTIPLAYER wargame experience. The game works wonderfully with "play by email" and even frantic games like myself who always put the gamespeed to max can enjoy the slower pace of PBEM because battles can determine EVERYTHING much like an roguelike.\n\nThe game comes with a huge manual, and a decent tutorial.

It is, hands down, the most comprehensive fantasy war game that is available.  That being said, it is not an easy game to play.  It is a game that you must learn to play.  It is definitely a "no skill cap" game.\n\nIf you want to win, it should be easy enough to find a guide that will explicitly give you a strategy that will steamroll any AI out there, but to me the true fun of Dominions is the freedom you have to play the kind of nation you want.\n\nDo you want to play as a nation of reptilian necromancers who worship a massive crocodillian devourer of souls?  How about a nation of reptilian necromancers who worship a stone monolith that blesses its followers with unearthly quickness and undying vitality?  How about a nation of mermen who worship a massive electrical octopus . . . IA IA SHOKTOPUS !\n\nLet me say a few words about the graphics.  At first glance, to the modern eye, the graphics might suck.  However, once you realize that the creators have lovingly crafted graphics for 1,500+ characters, you will have some appreciation for their lo-fi style.\n\nA steep learning curve, endless replayability, and a cult following: is Dominions 4 the game for you?","March 25, 2014","true","160.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I play the hell out of this game and it's still unbelievably challenging (especially in multiplayer) and interesting.  There are still nations that I haven't even played, much less effectively.\n\nWhat I will say is that it's not as fresh as it was.  I've begun to find it tedious practicing expansion, and I only do it when I feel inspired.  It's definitely worth it but it doesn't look like it to a lot of people, and it's not a perfect game - it's just deep and complex and grand.  I have friends who don't like the lack of control in battle, particularly since the AI can sometimes leave a lot to be desired.But even as a relatively casual player these days I can still recommend this game one hundred percent.\n\nThe various multiplayer and modding communities (Desura, dom3mods, etc.) make this game for me.  New content and support and guides help get both new players and veterans out of the gate to start experiencing the game - which is where you really start to develop an understanding of the nuance.\n\nMy suggestion to you is to buy it when it's on sale, and play it with your friends (who did the same).  Great way to play with and against humans before stumbling into a major community where you will lose often - in a game that usually has 8-20 players, a 15-20% win rate is pretty high.\n\nGo have Dagon lead lovecraftian shamblers out of the ocean to crush the egyptian lizardmen who are flanked by Jotun frost giants and dinosaur-riding amazons.

You can equip your leaders/special units with mystical items and there is lots of overland spells and ordinary ones. Not all countries rely on magic. Very diverse game with good replayability factor.\n\nMusic score is a little unusual medevil reporductions, though not bad at all. Wish there were a little bit more music themes.\n\nDeveloper is quite often patching and rebalancing the game, adding more things. Nations, summonable creatures and such at his own pace, but regularely and probably like with his earlier games on a constant basis for years. Pace is slow, but constant.

A very steep early learning curve that once surmounted gives way to hundreds of hours of gameplay. Most intriguing and complicated magic system that I've ever seen in a strategy game.\n\nAs for cons, there are many. Single player AI is remarkably useless creation that in battle contends itself with throwing completely random selections troop at you, with no ability to plan strategies or conduct diplomacy. Make no mistake, Dominons 4 is a multiplayer game to the bone, and much of it's lasting appeal is directly in proportion to how much you enjoy scheming and devicing strategies for beating human players.\n\nThe multiplayer system itself is frankly archaic, requiring the hosting of an old-fashioned game server for other players to connect to and upload their turns to specific games. Individual matches might run for months at a time.\n\nThe magic system while complex, is daunting to master and requires memorization of the vast spell lists to properly use. There are numerous exploitable mechanics that are slow to get fixed, as well as a plethora of bugs.\n\nDespite all it's flaws, Dominions 4 is still a true gem for turn-based strategy fans. It's quite unpolished and with decidedly indie production values, but with deep and rewarding mechanics.","January 8, 2015","true","527.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you want a great game without caring about graphics, welcome. Dominions 4 is one of the best experiences for those who enjoy strategy games. There are a crapton of nations to choose to conquer the world, each with customizeable features such as the growth of your dominion (basically who follows your god) or the heat or cold of your lands. The way you win is up to you, you choose how to win.  In my experience, it is THE most customizeable turn-based strategy I have ever seen. You position your units in your armies, and decide if they will either be in box formation, a long line, and who and how they will attack. You decide how many units go into this army, and who goes into that one. Maybe you want to go in, hacking and slashing with swords and axes. OR, you can defend your mges with your units, and control the battlefield through magic.

Even if the game wasn't practically limitless as far as strategy goes, the extensive mythological and theological research that composes the game's universe, reflected in the lore, is probably worth the price of admission alone.\n\nSure, you will see bad reviews but the fact is that the vast majority of them are made by people that simply didn't bother or couldn't manage to understand the game. You'll see comments about the lack of a tutorial (which is stupid, as a single cursory glance at the manual or ingame menus would reveal,) or things like the "lack of control" during battles (which again is stupid since the very core of combat is understanding unit strengths, positioning and scripting.) You'll see people whine that units are samey even if a couple games with different nations would prove otherwise. Likewise they have complained that the unit roster of each nation is limited, blissfully unaware that most every one has access to tons of summons, including nation unique ones. The list goes on and on and every single review in that vein is both as much a testament to laziness as it is pathetic.\n\nThe game has some problems, for sure, but they are seldom tied to content aside from a fairly rudimentary AI that doesn't have access to the breadth of tactics that a real opponent would. The interface can be clunky and micromanagent tough IF you don't bother to read the hotkeys reference. Setting up a live multiplayer game can be confusing the first time you do it (although not if you are used to running a server in any other game,) back to the AI issue it has no built-in way to do diplomacy or trading so during single player games you won't have that option. Units are plentiful but without careful reading it can be easy to miss why they should or should not be used at a given moment and chances are that at the beginning and at least at some point you will have to look up information on how to play a particular nation.\n\nIn multiplayer the game's AI problems are alleviated and the game shines to its full potential. There is simply no other game that offers as much variety in troops and strategies thanks to the combination of  pretender god options, the inherent strenghts and weakness of each nation and the plethora of spells plus equipment that you can research on top of whatever the map and the game's random events might bestow upon you. For example; even if you follow the absolute same strategy in two different games, in one game you might find territory that comes with independent mages or summons that can give you access to entirely different magic schools and in the process completely change how you go on about the game. In the same vein; the game has over two thousand random events that can range from national heroes appearing at your door to hellish portals opening somewhere in the world and letting demons pour out unchecked.\n\nSomething else that I haven't seen a single negative review touch upon is the fact that the game has a pretty extensive modding community. Mods can do everything from adding completely new nations to tweaking the so often called too easy AI. There's lots of balance tweaks, tools, nations based on other popular franchises, sprite changes, magic changes, even a mod that grabs bits and pieces of sprites to easily create entirely new nations with randomized units. Of course, there's also hundreds upon hundreds of user created maps both made by hand and created with the game's random map maker so the game is not bereft of content at any point.\n\nOn the matter of patches the game is still supported often and has undeniable gotten better with time. Since release there's been three new nations released for free, with at least one more coming soon. Other nations have been reworked to be made more competitive and flavorful as well; each and every one of these updates coming with a brand new batch of sprites, events and spells. Tons of bugs have been fixed, quality of life UI improvements have been added and even the AI is slowly being reworked to be more competitive as well. Since the development team is quite small, it is hard to tell for how long or not they might support the game but at this point in time we've come close to two years and with not a drop of paid DLC rearing its head. The price tag might seem a bit hefty mostly because of the graphics, but considering this game and its content can stand toe to toe with any AAA strategy game, it is more than reasonable.\n\nIn conclusion I think there's really no reason to skip this game. As long as you are not  in a rush to immediately go into a game and fail to give the manual and ingame menus even the slightlest little check, you will avoid 90% of the problems that the game is supposed to have.","April 11, 2014","true","112.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Tasked with taking the place of the now absent creator of the universe, your character (known as a Pretender God) seeks to become the new, true God. You must build armies, research a huge range of spells, and vanquish rival Pretenders to claim the ultimate prize in creation.\nI really, really like this game. It gives me a warm fuzzy feeling of nostalgia with the graphics, sound effects and just how much depth and substance is here. There's no glitz and dazzle with funky graphics to glamour you. Their are hundreds of spells in several different schools (such as Air, Earth, Fire, Water and darker paths like Death and Blood magic) which can be researched and used to advance your claim to Godhood. Your character can be anything from a wizened old crone, to a titan of the underworld, to a dragon, cyclops, divinely-created bull and many, many more things. This game is worth the price-tag, once you have this you don't need any other strategy games anymore, because this one has enough content to keep you going for a long time. It has a steep learning curve, so be prepared for that, but all the best games are the ones that take a while to get the hang of. Highly recommended to anyone who loves in-depth, fantasy turn-based strategy games.\nI give it 9.6 out of 10.","September 9, 2014","true","200.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The music is captivating and enthralling, with all of its drama. With extra orchestral stabs to accent details such as how you finish an enemy, the experience really feels complete and integrated. The gameplay is familiar for fans of the previous Illwinter games, with new innovations to spice things up.

Even if the game wasn't practically limitless as far as strategy goes, the extensive mythological and theological research that composes the game's universe, reflected in the lore, is probably worth the price of admission alone.\n\nSure, you will see bad reviews but the fact is that the vast majority of them are made by people that simply didn't bother or couldn't manage to understand the game. You'll see comments about the lack of a tutorial (which is stupid, as a single cursory glance at the manual or ingame menus would reveal,) or things like the "lack of control" during battles (which again is stupid since the very core of combat is understanding unit strengths, positioning and scripting.) You'll see people whine that units are samey even if a couple games with different nations would prove otherwise. Likewise they have complained that the unit roster of each nation is limited, blissfully unaware that most every one has access to tons of summons, including nation unique ones.

To quote Maxi’s review “If you really usually jump for TLDRs don't bother getting the game.”\n\nI want to be clear about this, I love this game. I think it's great fun. I've sunk around 100 hours into Dominions 3, with another 70 into Dom 4. I think Dom 4 is a flat out improvement from its predecessor, and given the choice I would chose to play Dom 4 every time. That said this is not really a game that I could recommend to my friends, let alone to some stranger on the Internet. To start off the graphics are old fashioned and I know a LOT of people who will turn up their nose at a game just because it doesn't look pretty. If the idea of some simple sprites moving across a painted background isn't your idea of an acceptable battle animation then turn around and walk the other way.\n\nThe combat may also be something that turns people off. The combat works through a scripting element, something that was designed in part so that players could engage in multiplayer through a play by email style (if that doesn't show you that the game might have some antiquated design ideas hanging around, I don't know what will). This means that you as a player cannot engage in combat in real time, it happens between game turns and you receive a summary and video of what happened in the combat while you were away. You set up your units, tell them where to go and what to do (within certain limitations of course. You cannot, for instance, order your archers to stop firing if friendlies come into danger of being shot, nor can you order your troops to wait more or less than two turns before charging headlong into the enemy), and then they handle everything by themselves without any more input by you. This can sometimes make you feel as though you are being cheated, like if you didn't get a very good scout report and the enemy wound up having cavalry you weren’t prepared for that decimate your troops with their lances. Maybe if you could alter orders on the fly, you would have ordered your mages to cast a spell to stop or slow the cavalry instead of trying to buff your own troops. I find this to just be part of the game, and I enjoy the strategic fetters it places upon my gameplay. Some people, though, may not. This, I think, is the main point of contention one will have with the game. If you can find yourself enjoying the combat, then you'll probably be fine. That said, there are a smattering of more tedious issues that can still turn you away.\n\nOne such issue is micromanagement. On a small map with one to four other nations, you can manage your little empire without too much of a struggle. If you try to play on a large map with 12+ nations, you'll be working through a micromanagement slog the likes of which you may have not even comprehended before. If you are playing as a nation with heavy troops capable of only moving one province per turn, may the Pantokrator help you. Add in the fact that the UI is not great, and you might not even know how to do the thing that you want to do. I love micro (I play vanilla Dwarf Fortress as well), and I don't mind referring to the manual when I forget how to do a little thing like copy orders or make a mage cast the same spell every month, but if you aren't willing to find those little time saving things the micro can weigh you down even more quickly.\n\nThe last detractor is the AI, and this is the only real reason I'll ever take a break from the game. Dominions is the kind of game that was always developed with multiplayer in mind, and I think that the game gives players a lot of tools to build, execute, and adapt to different strategies. While I haven't played any multiplayer in my time with the game, I have seen several games and read a lot of the theorycrafting involved. While that isn't the same as playing a MP game, I think it gives me a measure of insight into how the game can function differently in MP as opposed to SP. Sadly, the AI isn't very good at using a lot of those strategic tools designed for human players. For example, let's say you have two kinds of units that can "hold the line" and buy time for either your ranged units or mages to kill the enemy. The first are heavily armored pikemen capable of repelling, and thus negating, enemy melee attacks. The second are heavy infantry with a shield, these ones better prepared to tank volleys of arrows. While I can build both and adapt which one I need depending on my opponent, I see the AI often just building one or the other and fielding that against all opponents regardless of attrition rate, or building both in equal numbers (which admittedly isn’t a very bad idea if you haven’t seen what your opponent's army looks like, but if I march in with a cadre of longbowmen maybe some more shield guys would be prudent). I have seen the AI do some cool things, I was foiled often in my early days by some spell I didn't even know about, but after a while I find myself wishing that the AI could bring something new and exciting to the table (Master enslave. Just once, I want to have to worry about Master Enslave in single player). Of course, this doesn't keep me away for long. The AI is fun enough to face at high difficulties that I enjoy myself, and after a while I just think of a new exciting thing that I want to try, so I don't care if the AI isn't amazing.\n\nAll in all, none of these things stop me from loving this game. I walk away from time to time, but I always find myself coming back, or even just thinking about the game when I'm taking a break from it. If none of the things I mentioned sound like they would bother you, then I would encourage you to go read some multiplayer threads, watch lets play videos, or in the best case scenario ask a friend of yours who has the game to let you try it. While I jumped into the Dominions series blindly and wound up loving it, I know that I'm exceptional in that regard. I don't think this game appeals to the average gamer, or even to the average strategy gamer. I think this is a game for the kind of person who was never bothered by the Dwarf Fortress UI or “fun,” who always thought the diplomatic options in Civilization were just there for babies that didn't have the guts to earn their victory on the point of their spear, who likes the idea of a world in which no one is ever the "good guy," and who doesn't mind playing a game that might not be balanced if that imbalance allows one to tell a better story. Most importantly though, it is a game for someone who doesn't mind gambling 35$ on a game they may very well not like. If that doesn't sound like you, then that's fine. But if you're the special kind of crazy for whom it does, I'll be waiting here for you. Just you try to take my throne away from me. I dare you.","May 1, 2015","false","73.3"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","19","38","0","2"

It has an detailed and diverse lore based on various real mythologies and cultures. Battles take place in real time, and manage to apply an old school rpg feel (isometric 2d sprites rolling dice at eachother) to a concept of large scale battles. The number of factions, units, magic spells, and the customization of your god means there are almost limitless strategic possibilities.\n\nThis game probably gets lower numeric review scores because dominions 4 isn't much different from dominions 3, which isn't much different than dominions 2. I agree with this criticism, so if you own Dominions 3 the pricetag is not worth the upgrade.

Wanna capture and sacrifice pure blooded virgins to restore your youth?  Yep.  Call back undead and insane gods from the lower planes to destroy your opponents (when they aren't busy staring at the stars?).  Yep.  Your options are bit more limited in multiplayer, as many options are simply too inefficient to lead to victory, but of course the competition and joy of multiplayer games make the greater limitation worth it (and you still have a ton of options to take you to victory, but not as much of a "sandbox" feel as single player).\n\nIf you like turn based strategy, and like fantasy, you really can't go wrong here.

That means you can customize the pretender god you play, the nation worshipping said god, the individual units recruited by that nation, and even the weapons and armor available to individual units. It's quite literally staggering. The price looks somewhat steep, but considering it's an indie game with a very small staff, I can sympathize. Try it out, chances are you'll find more than a few things you like.\n\nOne more thing I can say is that if you're still doubtful because of the price tag, go ahead and try playing the Dominions 3 demo first.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiavals/recommended/259060/","tiavals","tiavals","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiavals/","413 products in account","Dominions 4 can be primarily enjoyed in two separate ways.\n\nThe first is the single-player experience. I say experience, because the gameplay aspect can be lacking compared to other games that are primarily meant to be played single-player(script based combat, turns being resolved all in one go, no interaction with the AI. Stuff that has to be the way it is because it wouldn't work in a 3 month multiplayer game otherwise)\nSo why would you play Dominions 4 in single player? For the incredible amount of background lore, or fluff, the game has to offer. There are three separate Eras, each of which has it's own nations(29 for the Early era, 29 for Middle, 23 for Late Era). Now, the beauty of the nations is that each has a very detailed history, which is usually interlinked to other nations both within the era and outside the era.\n\nFor instance, the nation of Man(boring name, I know) comes to existance in the Middle Era. It's a nation of knights and witches that live deep in the woods. Quite basic stuff, but they are based on several nations from the Early era. In the Early era, there existed the nation of Marverni, a gallic tribal nation that spread out to the faery land of Tir'na'nog. The fae were driven out, and their magic was stolen by those who would become the witches of Man. The magic of these witches is very similar to that of the fae, but also has aspects of a nearby nation of sea giants that has since gone extinct(In gameplay terms, they share national spells and magic paths). With the fae magic, the witches created a holy order of wardens to protect themselves. During the Late Era, many drastic changes have happened. Magic has fled the lands of Man, and the witches have been replaced by a more secular class of mage-judges, who are some of the only ones that can work magic in the mystically drained land. The wardens of old have lost much of the power the witches had imbued them with, and have had to adapt their tactics in the changing world, turning to the use of crossbows from their old melee-only ways. Most of the nations change in a similar way to this, some die out completely with only remnants of their former nation diffused to other nations, and some new nations arise from nothingness, perhaps containing a smattering of elements from the Early Era, despite showing up in the Late Era.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the multiplayer. Where the gameplay was lacking in singleplayer, it's the opposite in multiplayer. It is incredibly deep and satisfying. With so many different nations and hundreds of spells(most of which have a purpose in the game. Though a handful are more or less useless, I think), the different possibilities are quite insane. Perhaps your army is composed of only flying troops, meaning you can fly around the world, striking where the enemy can't defend itself? Perhaps you have spells that can kill enemy commanders, which prevents them from flying around with their armies? Perhaps you have cast a spell of global repercussions which causes the world to be plunged to darkness, where the gold income of every place in the world plummets, unrest increases and battles are fought in pitch black darkness.(quite useful if you use a large amount of undead or you are a cave-dwelling troglodyte). Are your own national troops weak and useless? Well, you can make them more powerful with spells enchanting their strength, or perhaps giving all of them flight during battles, flaming arrows or turning them to mist. Suppose you wanted to summon creatures of legend such as manticores? Perhaps a dead hero you had was dear to you, well you can bring him back as a mummy that causes diseases to anyone nearby! Some may find it useful to craft an artifact sword that causes the temperature on the battlefield to raise, spontaneously combusting troops and causing them to tire out very quickly.  Does your nation lack archers? Why not craft magical bows that shoot a dozen arrows per shot and give a few of them to your commanders, instant ranged ability.\n\nJust keep in mind, Dominions 4 is designed to be played as a slow paced multiplayer game, where you play a turn every few days, so a multiplayer game may last several months. Of course, a singleplayer game is much faster, but since the enemy lacks human ingeniuity, it's far less exciting to play against.","December 26, 2014","true","296.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is good, but it is by no means worth as much as they are charging for it. I decided against that, however, because how much money a player is willing to throw around will vary greatly from one to the next, and I want this review to be based solely on the experience of playing the game, rather than on the experience of buying it.\n\nThe game is very complex, and you will probably have to play several times before you are even aware of all of the options available to you during play. There are many factions to choose from, and some of them play quite differently from others. I have probably spent as many hours reading the 400+ page manual as I have browsing through the character creation screens, designing "pretender gods". If you saw the screenshots, and didnt lose interest immediately, then you very likely are the kind of player who can set aside graphics for depth of content, and this game will reward your attitude.\n\nIf I were to seek to complain, two things would come to mind. ONE: the user interface could really use some work. There are many icons which can be clicked which give absolutely no indication of it, and many things you would think were interactable which serve no function at all. It is very easy to lose track of an army or leader, and then discover him again 40 turns later, only to realize hes gone to waste all that time. And TWO: much of the depth of this game is merely superficial. Many units are near carbon copies of others, only a single stat apart, and once you throw them both into a battle, you wont see any difference. You can research volumes of spells, and build hundreds of items, but most of these things will "come out in wash", as they say, proving to be mere distractions when it comes right down to it... although I certainly enjoyed being distracted, as such.\n\nIf you get a boner looking through pages and pages of stats and lore, while micromanaging every tiny aspect of a massive and complex empire, than you are going to love the hell out of Dominions 4. If you want to learn to play a game you spent 40 bucks on, in less than 10 hours, then you will hate it. Its worth a second look if its on sale, but I have a hard time recommending this at full price... not when Age of Wonders 3 is only 5 bucks more, and is easily just as deep but with far better graphics and combat mechanics, to boot.","March 16, 2015","true","22.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you enjoy building up a civilization and conquering your enimies this game has it all for you.

(there are so many) have i given the correct orders? these are just some of the things you need to consider prior to fighting. As you play more, you realise that a very important part to your victory is the decision around how you create your race, the pretender design and the magic paths are incredibly important.\nThis game has so much depth and challenge that it should keep you playing for years.\nPlaying against other players is hard but challenging and insanely fun, with in and out of game diplomacy allowing you to create alliances or trick others into attacking one another, so much is possible. This is one of those games that doesn't appeal to people after a gorgeous graphical experience but it rewards those who love in depth games that require thought and tactics to get things done.\nAmazing.","June 22, 2014","true","204.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not by the graphics, they are terrible, but there's a certain charm to them, helped by the music...  But no, it was by the simple fact that you are dumped into the game with no tutorial (there IS a tutorial, but it requires you to read a manual which you either need to print off or buy from the dev's for another £7-8).  The details are not within the tutorial as you may expect.\n\nBut, I persevered and watched various videos online to learn more and eventually got myself to finally do the written tutorial which was immensely helpful.\n\nSo whilst I recommend the game, I would also advise it is not for someone who just expects to jump right in and play it.  I had to watch videos just to learn how to use the interface, let alone actually play the game.  So be prepared to have to do a little work to actually begin enjoying it.\n\nOnce you get through this though, there is a fantastic amount of depth to it.

I'll go ahead and get the (tiny) amount of criticism out of the way - the game has an unusual user interface, and targeted selection of units can be especially tedious at times. With that detail out of the way, I only have good things to say about Dominions 3. The writing in the game is top-notch, and very immersive. You often have to play multiple races to get a fuller picture of the history, but it's rich and satisfying once you piece it together. The Tuatha and the Fomorian Giants are a good example. The game plays in a traditional fashion concerning territories and the movement of agents and armies, much like other turn-based games. However, to locate the useful goodies in a territory, you'll have to cultivate a few powerful mages among your commanders, to find hidden sites that can provide mana gems, unique and powerful units for recruitment, or special effects, once unearthed. You'll need them (and magi once again) for the forging of magical items to equip your agents, priests, mages, generals, prophet, and your Pretender God. But the true meat of the game is in spreading your dominion (aka faith) across the map. It is the source of your power, and since it can flow into enemy territoy, it can also hamper their efforts to withstand your (inevitable) attack. Be sure to build lots of temples in your own honor! Put those puny mortal mages to work researching powerful magic that can affect the whole world. Turn day to perpetual night, bring on and endless winter, summon hurricanes, kill someone from anywhere in the world, dispach the flying monkeys to pluck away some unfortunate soul! Last Pretender God standing wins the prize - true Godhood. Sounds simple, right? Think again. It's a deep and complex game, and can be quite the challenge at times. So join in the fun, weave your own epic tale! Smash vampires with giants, ♥♥♥♥♥ queens (yes, its a real Pretender) with a midget masher, or run from Cthulu! It's all in there, and waiting for you! Order now!","May 26, 2014","true","678.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Having a detailled combat report (which spell/units killed which unit, how much gems have been consumed and by who, how much damage have been spared by the units armors...) could also help a lot for beginners like me ! Even being able to rewind the combats to assess by hand the damages and deaths could be of help.\n\nAlso too bad the graphics are so cryptics and ugly, especially the UI and map overlays, it does not help with the difficulty when you cannot assess  at a quick glance the state of your dominion. Having a strategic map that looks more polished would probably make this game more enjoyable and while it would mean some work, it would not necessitate a 3D rework of any kind, just look at Heroes 2/3 for an example of 2D strategic UI that is beautiful, informative and easy to understand. Some ugliness lies also in the anti-aliasing abuse on every element, I understand it is probably to give more homogeneity to the sprites but it seems like a cheap trick.\n\nIt seems like a negative review but I swear it is not: this game is awesome, buy it if you haven't already, I just have to spare the rod and spoil the child ;)","May 7, 2014","true","41.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I played Dom 3 for years and I kept finding new things I had never figured. Who knew there was a secret kingdom of mirror-assassins all along? Well look at that, an oak in my capital now gives me gems. Oh cool, I made a demon castle in three red seconds.\n\nThis game is the most awesome strategy game there is, just like Dominions 3 was. The changes are not many but all of them have made it better. The new province-history screens give yet even more chance for RP, you can count the kills on your commanders, the individual age of each of your troops (hint: play pangea and they all live VEEERY long), and be a smart general by giving orders to your guys before the actual combat. And scout, for the love of god, scout. And assassinate too if you can, and spy.\n\nI am yet to try the team-mode but from the little tinkering I have tried, it looks pretty good. Will put limitations on prophets though.\n\nBut there are a few downsides that have been around bothering me sometimes. I will introduce them, as well.\nDiplomacy is sadly not present. Looking at the lore of the game, it shouldn't be, you are fighting against rival pretender gods after all.\nLuckily multiplayer can fix it... if you trust the players more than the AI. Just remember to bargain monthly tributes of gold and gems, and go raiding their provinces if they wont pay ;)\n\n\nAll in all. Buy this game. If you think you could give it a try, do it.

Its negative aspects are relatively minor, especially to attentive players who prefer gameplay to pretty pictures.\n\nSo let's address those negatives, shall we? I see two complaints more than any other: the interface and the graphics.\n\nIn regard to the former, everything is labelled one way or another and any and every action you take during your turn can be changed or undone until such time as you click the "End Turn" button. For attentive players, the interface should be no problem after a few minutes of browsing and experimentation.\n\nWhile I agree the graphics aren't pretty, I would argue that they don't need to be. As Dominions 4 is a turn-based strategy, there's no pressure to be able to identify everything immediately on sight. The graphics are sufficient in light of the type of game Dominions 4 is. Were it real-time, then I would agree entirely with the argument of sub-par graphics. As a bit of a tangeant, the game is a very small download, thanks in large part to the lesser graphics.\n\nDominions 4 has perhaps more positives than I can list, mostly in the form of its complex mechanics. While I would love to comment on them, I'm just trying to promote interest in the game, not write guides for it. Dominions 4 handles similarly to Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic, in that the map is divided into spaces (called Provinces) and armies are composed of commander units who lead squads of lesser soldiers. Assuming either series is of interest to you, I would suggest looking into this game as well.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Dominions 4 is a turn-based strategy with many complex mechanics that appeal to people looking for thoughtful gameplay and strategy over simplicity and high-end graphics. I give it my highest recommendation.","August 12, 2015","true","235.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is one of my favorites, and I come back to it every few months.  Each version has brought improvements, and 4 is the best so far.  I don't mind spending the money for the new versions, because supporting a durable indy developer is priceless.\n\nThere are numerous races to be played, and they are all very different.  There is a ton of replay value, just trying out new factions and learning their strengths and weaknesses.  It also makes you a better player, since those factions appear in other playthroughs as your rivals, and there is nothing like knowing your enemies intimately.\n\nThis very diversity of strategies leads to the game's major limitation: the AI opponent presents a very weak challenge.  It simply isn't built to compete at your level, so you will get to the point where playing against the computer is like playing against a young child: the only way to create a challenge is to let it cheat gratuitously.  Higher difficulty levels simply give the AI more and more bonuses, rather than kicking in more cleverness or sophistication.  I recognize that game AI is still a fantasy, but this is a fantasy game after all. ;)\n\nI am confident that human players would provide that competition; however, I have never had the flexibility to commit to that kind of long social engagement.

He was slain trying to take the Throne of Stars by a skeletal army commanded by 3 necromancers, but was resurected by his priests and enacted vengeance on the necromancers. His people, the Nazca, conquered the Atlanteans and Ichthyids, and with them wrested control of the last two Thrones of Ascension from the Tritons. His high priest Quizquiz claimed the Throne of Stability in his name, and the Sun God himself walked beneath the water and sat on the Throne of Ice, cementing his rule as the One True God against the frost giants and their pretender of the Hungry Forest.\n\nIf that was at all entertaining to read, you'll like this game.

Magic only adds to the complexity as you research a variety of spells in different "Schools" of magic but even then its unlikely you're faction will even favor all of the spells you research in a single campaign causing numerous spells to go essentially unused unless you can get some foreign troops skilled in that element to aid you.

Dominions 4 is much improved, allows kind of alliances, new game goals and (I repeat myself) no more game breaking bugs. 4 friends and I spent multiple weekends playing together and against each other; I enjoyed every moment.\n\nMy personal favourite game.","May 12, 2015","true","195.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That being said, it can be a really wild ride.  The basic premise is that the Pantokrator (the Overgod, think Aao if you know Forgotten Realms), has vanshied.  This leaves the lesser gods, demi-gods, demon lords, elemental kings, and even powerful "mortal" beings struggling to become the new Overgod.  The game focuses on recruiting armies and researching powerful magic to push back your opponents and become the only remaining God.  The mechanics can take a bit of getting used to (think along the lines of Risk, but with more depth from the various unit types and magic) but there are plenty of guids and manuals available, as well as an active fan base that is very helpful when it comes to questions.\n\nAlso, all mechanics aside, you can play as frost giants led by the very physical embodiment of Winter itself against an undead Roman Empire led by a horror from the Void outside of reality.  Why the f**k wouldn't you want to try that?  Buy this game, be a Pretender God, and claim your rightful destiny.","April 17, 2015","true","78.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Seems as though most AI only attack when prevoked though. Lost of epic battles with hundreds sometimes thousands of units. Lots of variety, magic is pretty cool and there is a rediculous amount of spells which is awesome. Some factions like Ermor are a little overpowered as they can cast an OP spell killing all living things on the map over about 5 years [60 turns] which isnt much to be honest turns go really fast. If you use a human faction beware of units that can trample as 10 of them can destroy a large army if you get unlucky. Hmm awesome massive maps, with dozens of factions. A trade system would be nice also, or trade routes to protect within ur faction. Good game, similar to dominions 3 but significantly better as far as I can tell.

I've seen that in series before, yet somehow I'm still impressed here. Right after I got it, I told a friend of mine who spent about a year of his free time playing two humongous maps of Age of Wonders II--something I never expected [was a typo] when I gave it to him as his first brush with the genre--that my initial estimate puts Dominions 4 at about (AoW2)^2 in content. Personally, I relish a steep learning curve: grand strategy titles and deeply dynamic RPG character building systems have been particular pleasures down this line. Nevertheless, starting Dominions 4 I was surprised such as I haven't been in a long time to see I had underestimated how much I wouldn't know.\n\nAt first I was moderately impressed at the apparent scope of the thing, and I started to get burnt out on my course of study about the time I felt I could look at the nations lists with their dozens of choices and think I could describe the basic flavor for all of them. But then for the first time I looked at my first details about the magical and crafting systems and as ideas and dimensions began to click I was truly impressed like I had finally shifted the top layer of this giant package, and underneath it was still layers more good and integrated stuff!\n\nThe more I've dug up hour after hour of yet more complimentary game dynamics and worldbuilding flavor, the more I've thought I wish I had bought this game full price instead of on sale: all the more power to the developers if they're this kind of craftsmen.","January 19, 2015","true","423.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That game was very hard to understand and play.  Dom3 was much, much better and Dom4 (in my opinion) is a modest improvement.

Not to mention several dozen different nations to play with and each of those in THREE ages (i.e. different ages of the world).  I don't think it's possible to play the same game twice the same way; there's just too much diversity.\n\nIt's easy to take this game as a series of battles: win every battle, beat the other god(s) and you win the game.  Wrong!  It is about magic and if you don't utilize magic, you will lose.  That alone makes it a challenging game to understand and play, and win.  I really like that part of the game.\n\nBut here's the problem for me:  It is a massively detailed micro-manager game.  You have to check every thing in every  province, every turn, and usually every army (or part of an army) every turn, and anything and everything else in every part of the game and almost every part of the map -- every turn!  If you really, really like that in a game, this is one you must buy.  It is fun, and interesting, and deep and complex...but after a while I find it overwhelmingly tedious.","December 22, 2014","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a wargame - a genre well known since the dawn of computer games. The building and research aspects are quite rudimentary (although paying attention to them is still necessary), and the diplomacy is absent. So all you do is trying it reduce your enemies to rubble with various types of troops and magical creatures. And this is where the game shines. At the start you have to choose your tribe and create a pretender god using RPG-like stats and collection of different avatars. The selection of tribes is awesome: game presents all manner of monstrosities and... I doubt all this is properly balanced but it's certainly fun to rummage through it and try different combinations. Main game unfolds on a strategic map where the player have to concentrate on logistics and army management. The battles takes place automatically but you can issue basic orders beforehand and send spies to obtain info about opposing force. Rush into battle blindly and you will be trampled, lose the initiative and enemy will encircle and overwhelm you. It's a challenging game that encourages good memory and tactical thinking.","May 9, 2014","true","22.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I had my doubts about buying it, since the changes seemed few and not game-changing. but... once you try it, there is no going back. the best change is the manual (YES, you can improve a 300 page manual. adding another 100 pages with every unit stats), but the others are those little things that seem unimportant, but you cannot live without them once you get used to them (note: although for me, the thrones of ascension aren't THAT great. I mean, I like them for the effects and the strategy twist, but I don't really needed a new victory condition. Conquering everything seems good enough for me. but you can still do that on dom4.... )\n\nI love this. It's the largest game I have seen in terms of quality content and replayability. and one of my all-time favorites. I totally see myself playing this a few years from now. And that's much to say.\n\na side note: don't start a map with too many opponents (~10), it will last VERY long (my first map on dom4 lasted for about 75 hours..... )\n\noh. and about the AI. it may not be a challenge for experienced players... but you will easily reach a few hundreds of hours before that. I mean, on normal difficulty, I still have to be very careful or I'll easily lose...\n\njust buy it. no need to even wait for a sale, even for full price is completely worth it.\n\nPS: I have something like 30hours more than steam says. but steam crashes every now and then. and my hours vanish. sigh.\n\nPPS: well, if you are not sure... there's a demo on the illwinter page.

While the process of reading this manual was a bit oppressive and a rather large time investment just to start playing, from what I can see is there is a game with an incredible amount of depth and replayability.\n\nJust from the start you get random worlds and the ability to craft your own "pretender" (basically a demigod) and then explore with the aim of conquering. There is espionage, assassinations, and management of your territories. Perhaps the only thing that's missing in my mind is diplomacy (it's a war game) but I for one never have really explored those aspects in games like this so nothing was really missing.\n\nThe difficulty of this title is steep, at least to someone like myself. What's good is that if you read the manual, you should be able to get several hours of playtime and experimentation before you start to get undermined by other nations. This gives you a good shot at your first playthrough to get a grasp on the basics before starting a hopefully more successful campaign.\n\nThe graphics are abhorrent, I won't lie, so if you need at least poor graphics to be satisfied I'd stay away. Graphics however are sacrificed for depth which to me, is far more important. There is so much complexity (but in a good way) to each aspect of the game: your towns (buildings, defense levels, dominion, etc.), the terrain, your soldiers (commanders, unit  types, formations, leadership, items), and a robust magic system as well.\n\nI could go on, but I already fear that this review is a bit incoherent as there really is a lot to say about the game.\n\n[B}TLDR[/B]\n\nPros\n+Great Depth of Gameplay, incredible opportunities for strategy.\n+Great Customization: Province Management, Commanders, Unit Types / Organization, Orders, etc.\n+Very Replayable due to custom game modes.\n+Tons of multiplayer options including classic favorites like Play By E-Mail and Hotseat\n+Rich in Lore and Mythology based upon real life mythology.\n+Tons of Unit Types, Spells, and Items\n\nCons\n-Clunky UI, not reading / following the tutorial will make it very diffiuclt to get used to the controls.\n-Incredibly huge manual (295 pages, of which 120 pages are essential reading) that you really must read if you don't want to spend many frustrating hours of trial and error.\n-Absolutely hideous graphics, they really aren't good at all.\n\n\n\nThe game is purportedly very moddable and that's something I will explore as I get bored of the stock game as well!","January 7, 2014","true","8.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's the fourth one in the series. If you've played the previous games the major new feature you will notice is the new thrones of ascension. These work like vicotry points that give you empire wide bonuses. They come in 3 sizes and you can configure how many are on the map and how many it takes to win the game.

It is feature rich with so many different units, spells, items... the learning curve makes it brutal but rewarding when you start understanding how to affect the world.\n\nI think my favorite aspect is creating leaders with unique equipment and casting abilities. These leaders will be generals for your basic unit and can enchance their combat abilties. As a game progresses, you will move up the different magic aspects which unlock more combat casting and summoning unit. You will also be able to pick up rare units to supplement your faction.\n\nThe game is just huge. If you want a game that will challenge you and offer high replayability check it out.

Unlike in games like Master of Magic where you can easily pick the spells you want to cast with your nation all the time to develop a theme or strategy that enhances the weak points or strengths of your race. Now, you can design your pretender to cast any spells you want. But this is a strategic game and your caster can only be in one place at one time and can usually only cast one of the big spells and then he/she/it is knocked unconscious. Its not very fun and does not make a lot of sense to me.\n\n2- Low Strategic Value/Adaptability offered by units - As with spells, each race has a handful of units that are great at certain things but there was not a lot of strategic decision making offered by the units. After you get used to constructing a line of spearmen who can push back units or are fronted by trampling war elephants/cavalry, there is little to be done adapting to an opponent. I wished spells or different units could respond better to the how the game changes on the combat scene, but it does not offer any adaptibility.\n\n3- The Strategy Game that makes you work - This is a big one for me. I don't mind researching unit stats and comparing them to each other. I really dont mind reading a 400 page manual to find out how each of the different nations function on a strategic level. But trying to figure out what spells you can and can't cast and trying to plan for it...and then just trying to see if it is even worth it because it feels like half of the spells are worthless in most situations ( aka, only affecting the weak ♥♥♥ caster with a melee damage buff...wtf...i guess this would be only for pretenders), is just frustrating.\n\nSo overall, I gave Dominions 4 a pretty fair shake. It has so much that would have been fun with a bit more tweaking and forethought, but the warfare is too one dimensional and cookie cutter.\n\nNot recommended.","January 21, 2015","false","20.4"," 51 of 107 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","51","107","4","0"

It really is! Unfortunately, there are a few problems with it that force me to say that to most of the people on steam, it's not worth it. That is the first and foremost problem with it: It's WAY too expensive. I bought it on sale and it was STILL 18 bucks. To an avid strategy/war/indie game fan(such as myself), that's a decent price, but to most people it's outrageous. The second problem with the game is that it gets a bit boring after a while. Build an army, send it into battle, it gets destroyed(or you take a few provinces), change a few battle tactics, and repeat. That gets boring to most people after a while. The last problem I'd like to cite is the bugs. All of the sudden, an entire armies goes missing, with no trace and no reason.\n\nThat all being said, this game would be great, if it were a bit cheaper. You just don't get as much fun play time for your dollar as you'd get from buying another game.\n\np.s.

I openly admit that. What I want to know is how at no point in four renditions of this game have they introduced a way to manage buildings more effectively than one province at a time. It took me nearly 20 minutes to complete a turn, and then I realised this was on a small map. I can't even concieve of how long it would take to complete a single game, and not because of any kind of "gameplay", simply hours and hours of clicking the same thing in menus.\n\nA building queue. That's all it would take. Let me queue up multiple buildings to be built, like you can with infantry. If I have 20 provinces, I have to go back and build every single building individually 20 times. Every castle, tower, walls, etc. I realized in my short time with this game I had spent about 50~60% of it not actually "playing". I was spending it clicking "build this". I could go into MSPaint, write the word "build this" and click it a few hundred thousand times and get pretty much the same experience.\n\nThe actual game? The infantry battles, the heroes, the actual "PLAYING" part? It's awesome. It was really fun! It's really in depth, a lot of tactics involved, and I loved it! But how does this game not have a better management system!? HOW?! How has not a single fan of this game told the developers "Hey you know what would be a good idea? The ability to queue up buildings." How can I possibly reccomend a game where I would completely cut out 50% of the "gameplay" if I could? It's horrendous. It's inhuman. I genuinely am concerned for anyone who plays this game regularly.

The various factions are diverse and customizable.  The basic premise is amusing and the overall flow of the game seems well designed.\n\nWhere the problem for me lies is the combat.   Battles are automated and the player can view the results as a replay after they occur.  After spending a fair amount of time in several games as differently designed factions setting up squads, I can say that I have no clue what does or doesn't work.  My strong armies were defeated by what seemed to be weaker ones with ease.  Parsing the combat logs didn't help me figure things out.  I read the actual game manual, which is quite interesting in and of itself, but it didn't seem to help with this.\n\nThe in game combat probably would have worked better as a turn based, player-controlled system.  I think perhaps the developers avoided that as they wanted a board game style that didn't get bogged down with combat.  The result is that, without extensive forum-diving, the average player will end up simply building large armies and throwing them around with no preconception of what will be effective.\n\nOn the other hand, the game developer continually updates the game and there are avid players from whom one might receive help.  If the game were about half its current price of 34.99 USD, I would recommend it.","April 6, 2015","false","16.3"," 5 of 21 people (24%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","24","5","21","2","2"

There seemed to be awesome depth, with tons of units, races, leaders, status modifiers, spells, and victory conditions.  My first game I picked a magic heavy leader with a race balanced between magic and combat.  I left faith at the wayside and pursued magic early on.  Magic is very costly to develop, and gives very little back, not to mention the high cost when you do use it.  I switched to being combat heavy and did well, though I was still trying to grasp all the nuances of battle (it has tons of options, but is ultimately autocalced).  the enemy had a delayed start, and when they did come unto the scene I beat them at every turn, though my casualties got higher with each battle.  As I started to clinch my victory I suddenly lost.  I was out faithed, and my leader suddenly died due to such.  so for my second game I sat down and tried to figure out a better approach.  I realized that just by dumping all my points into faith, and picking a race that had good priests I would win without having to win many battles, or develop any magic.  I picked a combat heavy leader, but maxed out faith, and picked the race with the best priests.  Early on I was too aggressive and suffered a lot of losses.  In the end I was a push over in every area, except faith (which i was being very innefficiant at), and I won easily.\n\nThe problem is that faith is cheap and easy, and there is no way to remove it as a victory condition.  Have a low faith side, and end up dead quick.  Have a High faith side and almost auto win.  Don't get me wrong, the faith mechanics other than your leader insta dying are great.  In fact most aspects of this game is great, however all of it means nothing due to the current death by faith mechanic.  balancing all enemies to have the same faith is the only way to actually use the majority of the game's mechanics, which is easiest to do via multiplayer with humans.","February 27, 2015","false","12.2"," 2 of 16 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","16","0","3"

I haven't written a review, but I see it's on sale and I wouldn't want people to waste their money. I would be so happy if I could get a refund, because I was expecting so much more. My fault for trusting the video it starts you off with. The most amazing part is the character/god creation which you see in the trailer, then the actual gameplay is crap. I should've left a review long ago, but I felt scammed and annoyed. Feel free to comment if you disagree.

In the single player version, there is no way to deal with the AI players except unending undeclared war. Add in that the limited development of the provinces (you can only build three buildings - temple, lab, and fort) and lack of depth in the economy and you are left with a really detailed set of units and spells, but for battles you cannot ever control. The lack of real player control over battles and the shallow economy makes this game tedious at best.","December 19, 2013","false","184.3"," 39 of 109 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","39","109","0","0"

You're thrown into an overly complex, bland, poorly designed/constructed UI with some overly complex stuff in the background, all combined with a learning curve that makes Crusader Kings 2 or Europa Universalis 4 look like learning how lego works. No tutorials or explanations for anything, no tooltips to explain how stuff works bar the bare minimum.\n\nI was recommended this game by someone who I won't be listening to in the future.

And as well making maps and getting the out of memory crash cause its just to big to handle. And also the crashes in general because maybe your nations are outdated and you have to uncheck them from the mods selection page, and wait till that mod is updated. But you can no longer play your saved games.\n\nAnother point loss because of how long it takes for mega playthroughs to be extremely long load times in between turns because the games calculating all the other nations moves, actions, new troops, and so on.\n\nOverall the game is fun and at least worth playing once in your life time to see just how big a game can be and how unique one can be as well.","December 12, 2015","true","40.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That out of the way, your mileage with the art style may vary.  If you don't like looking at the battles, you can simply look at the summaries to see how your army fared.\n\nApart from that, you have the deepest turn-based strategy game available, fourth generation and better than ever for what it offers.  Easily modifiable.  There are plenty of mods available if you know where to look (start at the Desura forums for this game).  If you don't have an imagination, this game probably isn't going to come through for your inner strategy geek.  Many of the pre-made maps are beautifully realized in a variety of art styles.\n\nThe game is easy to learn, but complex.  Certain civilizations will outperform and outclass others.  The worst civilizations are there to handicap better players so that they may play with their lesser skilled friends, or simply for the challenge.\n\nThere's multiplayer mode, which is the preferred way to play the game for many.  The AI isn't perfect for those who prefer single-player, but there are ways of meta-gaming if you want to challenge yourself solo.\n\nI'd recommend this game for anyone who can see past the game's flaws.  Perhaps wait for a sale and put this on your wishlist, but know that this game doesn't go on sale often.  If you do go full price, know that you're supporting a good indie developer that provides support for their games years after they're released.","November 25, 2015","true","52.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You begin as a patron god of one about 50 nations, each with a rich history, backstory, and set of quirks, and through your loyal believers, you take out the other gods by converting his believers, running them down with their military might, or by claiming enough thrones of ascension on the map.

In fairness some of these were do to leaving the game running overnight because I blearily walked away from a game to pass out without thinking of turning it off.\n\nI mean what is there to say.  It's possibly the greatest 4x game ever made.   Single player is immensely challenging on its own, but the multiplayer games are a whole different breed, something I've never seen really.  If you're like me, and a bit on the old side to enjoy twitch based RTS's or overly simplified 4x games, then this may be the product for you.  I have to say, the game is daunting.  Getting into it takes a LONG time.

You just aren't  But the process of getting better at dominons is fantastic.  Illwinter has been working and reworking this game for probably 10 years, and it shows.  Gameplay mechanics that are first mystifying are, once you really examine them, absolutely brilliant.\n\nI can't tell you why this game is so awesome in a review, because the depth is almost mind boggling.  All i can say is, if you like in depth TBS and you haven't played this, i wholeheartedly endorse it.  I simply can no longer play other TBS games, because i'd rather be using my limited gaming time on Dominions.\n\nOne caveat:  while SP is very good, this game truly shines in MP.  That's not to say you can't enjoy SP games, lots of folks do.  But i encourage you, once you get your feet wet, to play MP.  There is simply nothing like it.  There are times when there is so much riding on it, you'll be afraid to open your turn file.  And that, my friends, is the greatest experience in MP gaming!\n\nI hope to see you in game(don't worry, i'm still a pretty lousy player, you'll probably splatter me all over the map-but i'll still be enjoying the game!)","April 12","true","330.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Choose the Path tool and choose the option "Stroke path" to draw the Voronoi path net onto the picture (tada you have your provinces borders ready)\n9.

While there are only about five buildings you will choose from to construct, what makes the game so complex and interesting is the myriad of magic research, races, troop types, and crafting items you can make for your heroes. When these are coupled with a wide variety of customizable deities/wannabe gods vying for ascension, different victory conditions (research, a capture the flag like thrones of ascension, domination, etc.) as well as different Ages with different technology and magic, you get a very complex layered game. The ability to set battlefield formations for your troops and command types whereby you can march them into war and watch the battles play out (adjusting accordingly should your plans backfire) makes it even more interesting.

The best part is the fact that there's tons of them, all with rich lore that you can read up about.\n\nPersonally, I think CoE is a more challenging game, because your god isn't invincible as they are here.. that's the only flaw I see in this game.. once your dominion gets going and you unlock a lot of the mid-tier trinkets, your god basically is unkillable and could probably take armies on his own, then again I guess that's how it's supposed to be. I don't even think this can be considered a flaw.\n\nObviously this is not the game for you if you don't like 2d sprite graphics, you don't participate in the battles much, it's a really refreshing experience from most RTS games I've played, personally.","May 10","true","34.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You just aren't  But the process of getting better at dominons is fantastic.  Illwinter has been working and reworking this game for probably 10 years, and it shows.  Gameplay mechanics that are first mystifying are, once you really examine them, absolutely brilliant.\n\nI can't tell you why this game is so awesome in a review, because the depth is almost mind boggling.  All i can say is, if you like in depth TBS and you haven't played this, i wholeheartedly endorse it.  I simply can no longer play other TBS games, because i'd rather be using my limited gaming time on Dominions.\n\nOne caveat:  while SP is very good, this game truly shines in MP.  That's not to say you can't enjoy SP games, lots of folks do.  But i encourage you, once you get your feet wet, to play MP.  There is simply nothing like it.  There are times when there is so much riding on it, you'll be afraid to open your turn file.  And that, my friends, is the greatest experience in MP gaming!\n\nI hope to see you in game(don't worry, i'm still a pretty lousy player, you'll probably splatter me all over the map-but i'll still be enjoying the game!)","April 12","true","330.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the civilizations for example, are based on historical civilizations but are changed to suit a more mythological theme. Meaning, you wont be fighting elves, orcs and dwarfs, but rather giants and lizard men. And the use of priests and religious figures is also an almost prominent factor of the games main objective.\n\nStory:\nThe god of all has vanished and in the abscence of this supreme being, many 'pretender gods' have risen to take the throne above all. These pretender gods will raise armies, and fight eachother in brutal combat to ensure claiming the throne for themselves. You play as one of these pretender gods. You must claim the thrones of ascension to accomplish the goal of winning the game, however, you can also just dominate the land with your mighty armies.\n\nHow it plays:\nThis game plays very much like a board game. You can see the map on a birds eye scale of the world and you can move different units to different settlements in a turn based manner where they can perform different tasks. Such as, spreading your dominion (being your influential power over different areas), killing off rebel forces in nearby areas or build temples, forts and castles for extra deffensive capabilities. This game can be delightfully tactical.\n\nUnits:\nThere are many different units in the game. Each civilisation often has their own unique ones. But your pretender god is the most powerful a lot of the time. You can take your pretender god into battle, and it can increase the fear of your enemies more than anything which makes them more likely to flee the battle. Which is what happens a lot of the time, usually not all enemies get killed, they eventually run away. But the pretender god can be good for ensuring success in risky battles. There are then more weaker tier units you can simply use as cannon fodder, because of how cheap they are, resource wise. And then there are more powerful infantry and calvalry and as well as more powerful archer units that can be made for more resources. Different settlements may also allow you to recruit different units you can't recruit anywhere else. You can also make scouts and priests. Priests can spread dominion and scouts can swiftly move through enemy territory with ease.\n\nCustomization:\nAs far as customization goes, you get to choose what kind of pretender god you would like. Different civilizations have different kinds of pretender gods available, and a lot look different in their own unique ways. Also all will have different stats and abilities, but those can not be customized. You simply choose a god, give your god a name and then you get to choose the game options which there are many, as well as many different maps to play on, making the game very replayable for most I imagine. Also game options include victory conditions, difficulty and number of AI, etc...\n\nGraphics:\nThis is not a game made for good or even half decent graphic design. The graphics are not that great, but that shouldn't be a problem for any gamer with a reasonably decent imagination. You play the game and as you play you can see everything that's going on inside your head and that's pretty easy to get into, and fun. If you do not have a good enough imagination the game will probably feel empty or hollow.\n\nLearning curve:\nThere is a big enough learning curve at first, but things start to click into place eventually and when they do, you'll be flying through this game. There is a tutorial in this game, but for me it was quite a poor one.\n\nOn a sad note:\nDiplomacy system is almost non-existent. To declare war means to attack someone. And the AI can declare war on you without even havind to attack you straight away. No sort of trade involved either, (But that seems okay.) or any kind of peace treaty can be made from what I have seen so far. Once war is declared, it goes on till one kingdom falls to the hands of the other. I wish diplomacy played a bigger role in this game it would make things a little more interesting, but then again, there can only be one winner.\n\nVerdict:\nTons of fun to play, if you have a good imagination and don't mind bad graphics.\nSteep enough learning curve, with poor tutorial.\nCan be very tactical, with vast amounts of units and civilizations and different abilities for each one.\nIt immerses you in the story and goal to ascend to the throne above all gods.\nNo good diplomacy system.\nMore could have been added on to the soundtrack I guess, but that's my opinion. Many might disagree there.\nLoads of stats and information is given throughout the game on all main units and battles are done accuratly.\nGood AI from what I have seen.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game.\nIt's worth your time,\nand can have some very epic and memorable moments.\n\n8/10\nI throughly enjoy this game. But I wish there was more to diplomacy.\nMy imagination has done fair work on this game, but extra graphic\ndesign in certain parts wouldn't hurt at all.\nAnd having a bad tutorial mode can be a real pain. But,\na lot of the positives really make up for it.\n\nHope this review helped!","May 8","true","17.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I really hate the turn times in it, over all I give this game a 9/10. Lots of units, fractions, and I love these kind of games that you take over like a map. So addictive to me, this game would be perfect even with the slow turn times if it had some diplomacy in it and allies and stuff. The only way to have a ally in it, is set up the game that way with teams in the start. The game is more for online, but I never play online and I love it without it.  One of the best games I have ever played.\n\nYOU know after awhile you realize I really hate those turn times and I can not play it anymore, so have to turn it to a negative review. The game is great but there is like a 11 min or + turn wait on large mapes with 8 nations every time you hit that end turn. They say play smaller mapes but why??? I have  pretty fast comptuer and this really blows for me and I find myself to stay away unless you like looking at a screen. People say get a book or something or do something else but why???? so it drove me to not play the game anymore.\n\nSo think about it it says I play about 200 hrs + what have I really played? if 1/2 of the 1hr you sit and stare???Hell might only be 50 hrs...can not play anymore. Great game though..","January 19","false","283.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
