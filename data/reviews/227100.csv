No other zombie game has managed to replicate the dread and imminent doom of the Romero-style zombie"\n\nI've never been good at stealth games. I've also never been good at driving games - blame it on my Asian heritage.\n\nWhen I played the original Sniper Elite V2, I loved the World War 2 setting, as well as the simulated realism of Sniper Physics -- distance to target, bullet drop, wind, holding your breath to steady your shots. I detested the stealthing segments, throwing rocks and scurrying about. I would try the stealth approach 3-4 times, give up in frustration, and go very loud and turn the game into a shooting gallery as enemies attempt to find me, with my back against a wall and all approaches covered. Ultimately,  the original Sniper Elite V2 wasn't for me -- that's not a knock on my game, simply just a mismatch between my playstyle and game preferences.\n\nSniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army was everything I loved about Sniper Elite V2, with an amazingly well-crafted zombie atmosphere. No other zombie game has managed to replicate the dread and imminent doom of the Romero-style zombie -- Left for Dead's rage zombies scamper towards you in waves but drop like paper mâché; Dead Island's zombies are sparse and require a lot of physical damage; Dead Rising zombies ignore you most of the time.  SE:NZA sticks you with the great conundrum of taking the time to properly aim for a headshot, at the risk of the other 10+ zombies getting closer. No other game has induced the same sense of panic when you realize just how badly surround you are -- they're just shambling slowly, how could I possible be surrounded?\n\nThe stages themselves are very linear, albeit with extremely large areas for each major wave of attacks. There is room to kite, until the special zombies begin to appear. The suicide explosive zombies felt very unfair -- they're very difficult to deal with if playing single player, given the damage they deliver.  The resurrected skeletons are also a nuisance, but I suppose they force you to reprioritize your plan and backpeddle while shooting.\n\nThe fifth area "fetch quest" in the subways was a chore, needlessly extending the game. I did enjoy the fact that these stages are all created from the base Sniper Elite V2 stages, but with much more fog and blood splatter.\n\nPicking up this game at $15 for a 4-pack was a steal, and kept my group of co-op friends occupied for a good two weeks, running one or two stages a night.  There is a lack of replayability -- in fact, I've yet to finish the game, due to the difficulty spike of dealing with the last boss -- which tends to play much better with three players than two.\n\nI can recommend this game for people who are not looking for a hardcore challenge, but rather, a "beatable challenge" with their friends. ~$4 is the right price for this game, but definitely do it with similar-minded friends.","November 25, 2013","true","25.5"," 93 of 106 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","93","106","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleamagician/recommended/227100/","fleamagician","Flea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleamagician/","184 products in account","If you haven’t played anything in the Sniper Elite series, what sets them apart from other run-and-gun shooters is the emphasis on over-the-top sniper shots with x-ray cams. The kills feel incredibly satisfying and the reliance on accuracy pushes one to enhance their skill and experiment with the weaponry to find the best player method. What is NOT here is the stealth element of the previous games, nor is it missed.\n\nIf you’ve played other zombie games, like Killing Floor or Left 4 Dead, this series emphasizes limited weapon selection, each with different strengths and weaknesses. It also emphasizes slow shambling zombies over fast-moving ones. The mood is set very well in this game, as it does a good job of providing a feel of a destroyed hellish zombie-infested landscape. It is sufficiently creepy, particularly because you know that survival depends on seeing them first and getting a good distance between you and them. As they shamble closer, accuracy matters more making it harder to pull off shots when it matters most, complimenting the major strengths of this game.\n\nNo doubt, you’ve read some criticism of this game. Some of the most prominent criticisms are condensed as follows:\n\nCheap and unambitious.\nMonotonous and repetitive gameplay.\nCashgrab.\nUnoriginal.\nNo plot.\n\nWhile some of these are accurate to a degree, the reality is that even if they *are* true, it shouldn’t scare you away from this title. It is very fun with four people. I could go by each and refute them point by point, but most of these concerns can be alleviated by two counterpoints.\n\nFirst, this game *is* cheap. The game is $15.00. The average movie ticket is between $7.84 and $8.38 (as of November 2013). At 1 Hour and 30 minutes as the average length of a film, if you get even three hours of enjoyment out of the game, you’ve already gotten more out of it than your average movie (and you can bring your own snacks and be as loud as you like.) It’s not meant to be some gaming magnum opus, and many Triple A releases try too hard to do this, and fail miserably. This is what you might call a “niche market” game… its aimed at a small segment of the gaming community for a modest profit. This is not a bad thing nor is it any more a cashgrab than any other game produced. While it is not for everyone (nor is it meant to be), it is worth the price of admission.\n\nSecond, as far as repetitive gameplay, yes it does have this. Every game is repetitive within certain respects, and the lack of a compelling plot or original gameplay elements makes this title’s repetitive nature relatively obvious. You *can* turn off the x-ray mode if it becomes overwhelming (or reduce its frequency) and the repetitive aspects are alleviated if you play with friends. The solo game mode is best enjoyed in small chunks. The shotguns function as shotguns, the sniper rifles function as sniper rifles, and pistols function as pistols. If you get tired of mowing down zombies with these methods, there are relatively few shooter games that will overcome this limitation. However, one should not expect too much innovation from a shooter game. There are precious few shooters that are innovative with regard to combat mechanics, or they’re successful at dressing up this shortcoming by using non-shooter elements. Much like the title implies, what you see is what you get… and what you get is pretty reasonable and fun in the right mindset.","November 26, 2013","true","21.2"," 51 of 55 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","51","55","0","0"

I will admit I was initially a bit off-put by the nazi zombie theme (how often have we seen that in the last few years?), and the appearance that it was a cheap cash-in on Sniper Elite V2's engine (and in some ways, it is), but it actually is a fun little romp with some nice varied stages (five in total), good variety of weapons, and some fun enemies thrown into the mix. Strategizing with friends, just having a good time finding that perfect sniping spot to pick off zombies, aiming for high-point shots (judged by distance, where you shot them, with what weapon, etc.), and then it all crumbling down sometimes as you all get swarmed and have to struggle to survive... It's not super-lengthy, and the ending did disappoint me, but I had a good time with it, and can be a blast with friends.","November 26, 2013","true","15.0"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","39","46","0","0"

However, we are not just talking about any old Zombie here (particularly those wussy Zombies who keep getting their backsides handed to them by plants) but none other than Nazi Zombies (as if Nazi's weren't nasty enough whilst alive they now torment us as the risen dead). Set in Berlin - the game ditches the serious demeanor of the original campaign in favor of the occult where Hitler has just unleashed legions of the undead in his last bid attempt to salvage the dying embers of his war machine.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=349663511\nThere are four characters to choose from allowing the player to jump into any number of co-op situations for up to and including four people. Nazi Zombie Army is a game designed solely around having stupid fun with friends and you will need to work together if you plan on making it through these blood drenched streets, sewers and subways. The single player campaign plays out exactly the same as the co-op campaign and is really not where you want to be spending too much of your time. The levels are long and hard and dying in single player and then exiting (even though you have already hit various checkpoints throughout a level) will put you right back at square one killing off any accumulated joy in quite a short frustrating space of time. However, with four players thrown into the mix the game becomes one big chaotic scramble as you try your best to stay alive or keep your other team mates alive all whilst trying to get in that perfect head or torso shot that takes the enemy down immediately.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=349665129\nThe more players thrown into the mix the more legions of the undead you will face so acting fast and acting quick will save lives here. The game never seems to take itself too seriously, well how serious can you get you when pairing Nazi and Zombie together - but that does not mean the game plays things for camp laughs. If anything the player should feel just that little unsettled not knowing what hoard lies in wait around the corner. Most of the levels are incredibly atmospheric and well designed with ammo stations placed just about right near the time you begin to run out.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=349664299\nI was not expecting Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army to be such a looker. From lighting effects to explosion damage the game looks consistently good with high definition textures everywhere. It does come at a price though as Nazi Zombie Army does require quite a recent desktop or laptop with decent GPU and memory to run optimally. The game should last most players roughly between 7- 10 hours depending on how you play (which is expected given the pricing) but there is always the next level of difficulty to tackle once done so there is quite a bit here to keep most gamers entertained for a while.\n\nI really enjoyed this title and I can heartily recommend it to groups of 4 people looking for some cool Zombie sniping action at a reasonable price that manages to also look quite phenomenal and really is a blast to play.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 12, 2014","true","17.6"," 41 of 53 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","41","53","0","2"

Well this one is different. As I said earlier, the zombies are slow but also deadly just like in one of George Romero's movies. You can play on solo or with three friends, both are not bad but experiencing with friends are awesome.

Good range of guns and sidearms. Fun gameplay though can repeat in each level, Kill a big horde of zombies do it again, safe room, kill another horde, get to the objective, hold out against a seige then finish. Levels aren't incredibly long but not too short so I love them fro that. Not a massive range of zombies but it tries to keep its scfi roots in the ground with a selection of, regular zombies, regular zombies with explosive strapped to them, heavy zombie with LMG, skelitons, sniper zombie and occasional occult leader or boss type zombie near the end of the campaign so not over the top but not stupid either.

It takes the unique sniper gameplay established by the game Sniper Elite V2 and implements zombies into it. Quite simple really but at the same time glorious. Theres really no counterpart for landing the perfet headshot on a zombie and then watching the bullet slowly turn the zombies bowls inside out. It never gets old. In addition to shooting zombies with your sniper rifle you can use both an SMG of your choise and a trusty old pistol , and trust me you ll be using those a lot more than you 'd think, which is something I really enjoyed seeing as how both the SMG and the pistol where left practily completely unused when I played the Sniper EIlite V2 game. The zombies are also masterfully done with each enemy type having plenty of unique animations that make them seem remarkably realistic and terrifying. These are the strong points of the game, as unfortuneatly it does come with some weak points.\n\nFirst of all the entirety of the maps available to play on are recycled material from the game Sniper Elite V2 that just have had a paint job of blood and satanic symbols done to them and then mixed to make new maps. For someone thats played the game Sniper Elite V2 this is quite disapointing as you are not greeted with anything fresh as far as sceenery is conserned. The game itself is also quite small containing only 5 levels, each lasting about 30 mins on the highest difficulty. However it should be noted the gameplay does give the game some replayability. The story is also quite monotonus and dull and moreover most chapters goals are "Survive the siege of zombies" or "Clear out the Zombies" something that adds to the general apathy you ll develop for the games story. By far the weakest point of this game and one that really saddens me is the fact its almost completely dead. Out of 2 days of playing during christmas and while the game was on sale I barely got into 10 lobbys ,and in most the same people kept coming up. For a game thats based around team work this is a big minus. Most of the achievements available while quite simple required a 4-player team, and so it was a real struggle getting them all. And it is realy a shame that this game has been abandoned to such a degree because its a really solid, good game.\n\nTo conclude , Sniper Elite Zombie Army 1 is a unique, fun and an overal great game. It does have its drawbacks and it is for the most part dead, but if you manage to gather some friends, or build a group using the steam forums its a must buy for any zombie fun out there.","January 2, 2015","true","18.4"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","18","25","3","0"

First, the good; there's a lot of action, so that's pretty fun. There's some bullet drop for the sniper rifles, right on. The game rewards loot hunters, you'll find guns/ammo all over. The selection of firearms is quite good, something like 20 if I recall correctly. It's interesting being able to set up traps. The slow-mo hits are cool, it's a creepy and stressful game, as well as EXTREMILY difficult sometimes. I won't spoil anything but... that... friggin... church.\n\nI think that covers the good, now for the not so good; the MP40 fires too fast, SVT40 fires too slow, STG44 is too weak, M91/30's (Mosin Nagant) front sight is actually a Kar98k front sight, and the M1903's stock looks like a hybrid between a No.4 Lee Enfield and an M1917. From what I can tell, none of the scopes are accurate to real life. I find the special infected can be quite annoying, there is a serious lack of stealth for a sniper game, there is a serious lack of sniping for a sniper game (rarely go beyond 100m. Rarely go beyond 50m for that matter), one of my biggest gripes is there's no FPS option thus no aim down the sights option, and my last issue so far is I've been playing for roughly 2 hours now and it seems to be the same thing over and over:\n\n*SPOILERS* Fight a wave that instantly knows where you are. Fight another wave that instantly knows where you are. Fight another wave or two in the same manner. Find a safe house, restock on supplies, maybe change firearms. Fight a wave that instantly knows where you are. Fight a wave of jogging skeletons that instantly know where you are, fight a sniper who can jump better than spider man, fight another wave that instantly knows where you are. Safe house. Somewhere along the line is the friggin church. Maybe I'm just bad at 3rd person shooters, but I tried about a half dozen times to beat that friggin checkpoint with the MGing tank nazi, and I'm only on marksman (Normal).\n\nDraw your own conclusions.

It’s scary, reasonably good graphics, and everything is as it should be.  However,  the shortage of ammo for close range guns, the slow rate of fire and reload,  means that this is about sitting as far away from the action as you can get and slowly picking the zombies off one by one. If they had changed the balance of the game a little, by including more ammo for the shotgun, and making reloads faster, and they would have brought players in closer to the action and dramatically improved the game.  As it stands, the pace is just too slow. The frequent slow-motion sequences really are unnecessary and really just make the game even slower. Recommended? If you plan on single player then I would say no, but the game does have some merit in four player coop, especially if you club together and buy the four game pack.","April 1, 2013","true","1.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You might have played the previous Sniper Elite games. They're both awesome sniper games. And that's the area where this Sniper Elite doesn't work all that well. It works reasonably well in the larger (outside) areas, but when you're fighting in narrow hallways and tunnels it kinda falls flat on its face. Yes, I know, if the whole team is sniping, there's no way you can die, right ? True. But at least make the weapons for these sections enjoyable to use. Most of them are spray and pray and it takes a crazy amount of bullets to put down just one enemy, let alone massive groups during the more intense firefights. The sniping part is enjoyable as always, and the x-ray cam is just awesome, but is shown too frequently at times.\n\nThe game has a  total of 5 levels. They're all quite big and it's hard to complete any of them on your own. So it's best played with a group of 4 people. It's also the most fun this way.\n\nHowever, the party mechanic could use some work. There are massive amounts of idle hosts, and searching for an existing game practically always leads to you re-entering this very same idle party, which is frustrating and annoying. That, and there are some rage quiters so halfway or near the end of a level someone might leave and if it's the host you'll return back to the main menu, which, well... which sucks !\n\nIn the end I did have fun with it, but it happened too often that the host left in my last couple of games. It's the reason I stopped playing. Pity.\n\n[Rating: 68/100]","March 2, 2013","true","15.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I finally took the plunge after the price went down to 3.49$ and I really regret getting this so late and all my friends are done playing this and now I have no one to play with.\n\nThe game is similar to left 4 dead series where you move from one point of map to another shooting your way through hordes of zombies. It is basically a big snipping target practice and it can get really tense at time. The use of items like mine and tripwires add a bit more strategy elements compares to L4D.\n\nGraphic wise the game is quite nice to look at. The kill can is fun as usual although this time around you only get to see the head shots as body shots don't kill zombies. Maps are atmospheric and sound is excellent and really creepy, although the art assets get recycled a lot and can get repetitive. There are not a big variety of enemies and I would love to see more types of zombies like the special infected in L4D. Music is bad in this game, the techno genre really is out of place in the ww2 setting.\n\nOverall I'm pleasantly surprised by this game, it is short and a bit bare in contents, but for 3.49$it's a steal.","February 27, 2014","true","8.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

One on hand the X-Ray cameras of a bullet tearing up potential rotten lungs and exploding a Zombie's testes is indeed hilarious, but some of the most dull level design (as they're all ripped from Sniper Elite V2) and ♥♥♥♥ poor gameplay really make me just love to pick problems with the game.\n\nYou do get access to all the DLC weapons from Sniper Elite V2, which is lovely, but you'll soon realise that 90% of the guns are bloody useless as bolt action rifles aren't particularly effecient when 40 zombies are marching up the staircase to see what the taste of human brain is actually like. And the boss fights, good god they are terrible. If you're not endlessly spamming bullets in to an 8 foot zombie with a Machine Gun that can down all 4 of you in a minute you're fighting a 30 foot ghost who you damage by shooting incredibly fast moving skulls. Sound fun? No it bloody isn't.\n\nI haven't even mentioned the screaming suicide Zombies who run straight up to you in an attempt to blow themselves up. Hilarious as it might be, the typical AI quirks the zombies show like being unable to walk in a straight line because of pathing issues make this INCREDIBLY frustrating when something moving at 50 miles an hour that can instantly kill you can't be easily dispatched because he doesn't know which side of the pavement looks prettier.\n\nUnless you are the BIGGEST Sniper Elite fan or you're just hopelessly drunk and want to see rotting lungs be punctured for hours on end, I really can't recommend this wholeheartedly.","November 9, 2014","false","14.4"," 28 of 52 people (54%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","54","28","52","9","0"

It all started with the franchise called "Resident Evil". From there it reached new heights, and one of  those things is this game. This game will keep you on the edge with an insane amount of Nazi zombies surrounding you as you try to shoot one!\n\nThe game introduces a x-ray feature, showing the bullet traveling out of the rifle in a slow motion animation piercing the body of the zombie exhibiting the skeleton of the body and its internal organs and passing through to leave you wanting more(sadly only happens when playing single mode) Depending on the difficulty: "Cadet", "Marksman" and "Sniper Elite"; you can probably tell which one is which; you will see a significant difference in how these zombies take blow for blow as you try to mow them down with your weapon and explosive arsenal. The difficulty effects two situations when playing the game. When upping the difficulty the foes you face are much tougher to kill, typically that is the case in the game. Additionally when increasing the difficulty the game also introduces I would suppose a real time bullet drop when shooting longer distances. You will have to eventually face a certain enemy from long ways away and you will have to compensate the distance on how far that "thing" is and where the bullet will hit.\n\nWhile using any rifle with a scope, you will find measurements on the reticle of your scope. These wil aide you on the bullet drop situations. You'll have to experiment with it for yourself. Also while using your scope you will once again find something. At the bottom left you can see a heart rate meter. Upon opening your scope your heart rate/beat will be relatively high. The more you keep the scope open or toggled, your heart rate will slowly decrease; allowing you to mantain a steady shot. Lowering your heart rate will enable you to hold your breath for a short period of time to prepare for a more precise shot. While holding your breath you will activate a red diamond on the reticle of the scope, the diamond will get smaller allowing you to accurately make a direct hit. What I've noticed is that your heart rate will rise to normal exiting out of the scope. Toggling your scope again you will see that the heart rate meter has gone up to what it was before.  So there are these little things that make this game what it is.[As you play the game more, you will see what kind of weapons that work well againist each type of enemy you encounter. Like any foe, there is always a weak spot just waiting to be exploited]\n\n"Sniper Elite:Nazi Zombie Army" isn't just about chopping up or blowing the head off of zombies you actually have to think where the target will be at a given point and above all else if you're playing co-opertively, communication is key into fighting off the nazi zombie hoard. Don't take communication lightly you really do need to communicate with each other. Everyone must know what to do and how to do it, to achieve victory or the expected result. Especially dealing with a certain foe you absolutely must use teamwork. Unless if you're anything like me where I kill everything myself, because I'm a pro. No, I only kid, but I do recommend it if you can tell by my novel you just read. If you've gotten this far without boring yourself with the utter lack of excitement of my description leading to this recommendation. Check this game out.\n\nIf I've atleast given a some what decent recommendation give it a "shot". I love it, it's a great game!","September 15, 2013","true","95.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now there are zombies all over Berlin. That's all the plot you need to know.\n\nNazi Zombie Army is a nice blend between the classic Sniper Elite and the zombie horde shooter Left 4 Dead. There's nothing to expect here except lots, lots of zombies. Zombies don't run, but are stronger than L4D. If you're new to Sniper Elite, coming from non-stealth games, this could be a good introduction to the combat and weapon mechanics as you fight at a slightly slower pace than, say, games like L4D, while not putting stealth or cover over everything like the original Sniper Elite.\n\nThis is what happens in the game: When the hordes attack, your senses will be strained as you try to headshot as many zombies as possible (as it is a guaranteed one hit kill) using your rifle, while occasionally switching to your SMG to wipe enemies that come up close, and kick down those that come way too close before executing them using a pistol, all while your well-placed traps of landmines and tripmines blast off other zombies that try to flank you.\n\nWhen the hordes do not attack, you have all the time in the world (compared to when they do) to align the perfect shot using focus time, a time-slowing aim assist that compensates your bullet drop. When things get hectic and frantic, your character (and probably you too) will breath more heavily, heart beat faster, resulting in worse aim that should be compensated by going crouch or prone.\n\nNotable, technical shots will reward you with the pleasure of Bullet Cam, a "killcam" bullet that shows how your bullet hits and kills your enemy. Was it a two-for-one piercing shot, a shot that goes directly through the pancreas or lungs (or right between the eyes like an overly manly predator?), or just a good old headshot from 200 meters? Bullet Cam will show you exactly what happened.\n\nAlso available in 4-player mode. Not that I have played it, unfortunately, as I cannot commit enough time to finish a session.\n\nThe graphics are quite good, but I have only a laptop so I sacrifice textures for framerate. Nevertheless, in NZA gameplay (and kill cams) shine much, much brighter than graphics quality, so you should focus on getting a satisfactory framerate and mouse calibration, as you will aim down the scope a lot.\n\nOh, one final tip before you begin: zombies shamble, and their heads shake like teenagers in discos. If you're careless or unlucky you may even miss with the entire mag of ammo. Consider yourself warned.","January 27, 2015","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Rebellion Developments took their time painstakingly recreating real-life locales and events in which the Bone Battles of Berlin took place. Skeleton warriors rattle and shake as they attempt to prevent the Allies from stealing all of their gold and dairy products, the sources of their skeleton powers. This hyper-realistic simulation game isn't without its flaws and inaccuracies, however. For instance, alongside the teeming skeleton hordes that haunt and spook the German villas and countrysides, you'll often encounter groups of undead Wehrmacht soldiers lumbering around. While there were indeed Nazis occupying the area at the time, any historian worth his salt will tell you that zombies weren't deployed in battle until the Korean War. They were more than likely added for gameplay reasons, as battling only skeletons would be far too difficult or frightening for any reasonable player. Overall the game is a fun, realistic, and enlightening depiction of some of the lesser-known events of World War II, and well worth the $15 price tag.\n\n2spoopy/10","June 4, 2015","true","6.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","3","4","6","0"

What this game does right is the graphics - they are absolutely superb, despite the fog being a bit too much in most places. The reflections, textures, etc are really really good, and runs incredibly well too! The CO-OP is pretty good, the only thing I noticed is bullet delay in online mode. In my opinion, it is a very very fun game and definitely worth its asking price. There is fun to be had, and lots of it. The shooting is stunning, especially the slow-motion kills with the sniper - gruesomely fantastic!\nOf course I just have to say the bad things now, and the game is very repetitive. On anything other than Cadet (easy difficulty) the enemies are bullet spondges so higher difficulty doesn't really make it any more fun.

This WAS NOT IT! We love shooter games, but this game requires too much dedication and it has impossible odds for casual gamers. If you have all day to dedicate playing the same level over and over again, this is your game. But if you only have a few hours a day to enjoy some gaming, the fact that you have to start over from the beginning every time you die is too frustrating to even attempt playing this game. After getting by four hordes of zombies and getting slaughtered by the fifth, the thought starting over at the beginning AGAIN made this game a whole lot of NOT FUN, and we removed it.

If you are looking for a challenge, this may be the game for you.","August 23, 2014","false","5.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The zombies have very authentic Romero feel because they are slow and they die by headshot only. If you drop 'em down by a body shot they will stand up again and again until you score a hit to the head. Its very satisfying to mow down the dead with the bolt action rifles, they are very well done in all aspects. There are a few types of special enemies too but they are not immersion breaking and they fit into the lore perfectly. The game have some awesome Survival scenarios where you have to defend a house or some spot until you clear all incoming zombies. Its great fun in coop with 4x enemy multipiler. I totally recommend this game if you have 1 or more friends to play with in coop.

I've read quite a few negative reviews which I think comes from the frustration of trying to snipe your way out of every situation which just won't work. The levels are like meat grinder puzzles: you'll get spammed with seemingly insurmountable waves of zombies which can be beaten by using the right combinations of weapons, explosives and cover.\n\nSimple rule: USE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB AT HAND. Sniper rifles for long distance, and use your secondary weapon once the zombies shamble closer. Your last lines of defence are your pistol (if you get caught in the middle of a sniper rifle reload) and your trusty Duke Nukem 3D like "Mighty Boot"TM if you are totally out of options.\n\nHolding down L-Ctrl allows you to "snap-shot" fire your sniper rifle without using the scope. This reminds me of the shift key aiming mode in Hotline Miami that once mastered, greatly increases your chances of success.\n\nThe bombed out apocalyptic Berlin is belivable & the zombie models and animations are some of the most beliveable I've seen.  The 80s B-movie synth soundtrack is great and the blood-curdling zombie shouts echoing through the ruins really adds to the tension.\n\nIt reminds me of Clive Barker's Undying, Painkiller and has some elements of Hotline Miami. I was surprised at how much fun it was on an action and strategy level despite some of the negative reviews I had read before buying.","June 30, 2014","true","30.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've read quite a few negative reviews which I think comes from the frustration of trying to snipe your way out of every situation which just won't work. The levels are like meat grinder puzzles: you'll get spammed with seemingly insurmountable waves of zombies which can be beaten by using the right combinations of weapons, explosives and cover.\n\nSimple rule: USE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB AT HAND. Sniper rifles for long distance, and use your secondary weapon once the zombies shamble closer. Your last lines of defence are your pistol (if you get caught in the middle of a sniper rifle reload) and your trusty Duke Nukem 3D like "Mighty Boot"TM if you are totally out of options.\n\nHolding down L-Ctrl allows you to "snap-shot" fire your sniper rifle without using the scope. This reminds me of the shift key aiming mode in Hotline Miami that once mastered, greatly increases your chances of success.\n\nThe bombed out apocalyptic Berlin is belivable & the zombie models and animations are some of the most beliveable I've seen.  The 80s B-movie synth soundtrack is great and the blood-curdling zombie shouts echoing through the ruins really adds to the tension.\n\nIt reminds me of Clive Barker's Undying, Painkiller and has some elements of Hotline Miami. I was surprised at how much fun it was on an action and strategy level despite some of the negative reviews I had read before buying.","June 30, 2014","true","30.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In short - great coop, tons of fun. If you like  killing hordes of zombies in the entourage of WWII - buy it.\n\nAnd now in more detail. I bought NZA when it was on sale, just didn't hear about it before, but have played Sniper Elite 2 though and liked it. Now I want you to get one important thing: I didn't read any reviews whatsoever, because if I did, I probably wouldn't have bought it. In my opinion, the scores I've seen for this game on the web - from 40s to 60s, are extremely low and I just don't know why. The game IS fun to play, both single or with friends. While it doesn't offer almost any story, the atmosphere in the game is just how it should be. It's heavy and you feel it. Sometimes it gets scary and very oppressing in SP and that is just what I was looking for, because it didn't feel this way in L4D. And in the multiplayer it gets really intense, because the number of zombies is multiplied to the number of players.\n\nIf you can't decide whether you need to buy it or not - just watch some gameplay videos. Good luck and have fun!","March 5, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tobyblood/recommended/227100/","tobyblood","Tears of Blood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tobyblood/","188 products in account","You'll notice a bad Metascore for this game. Don't always trust the Metascore. You know exactly what you are getting when you read the title of this game. You're going to be using a sniper rifle (primarily) to murder the living daylights out of nazi zombies. Now, I can understand if you just read that sentence and you said to yourself "That sounds idiotic." This game isn't for you, then. If you read that sentence, though, and you say to yourself "That sounds fun as hell!", then I can almost guarantee this game is worth your money, especially for how cheap it is.\n\nLet me get into the nitty-gritty here. The visuals for this game are superb. Some of the graphical options even kill my framerate, like supersampling. Not only are the textures fairly impressive, whether it be the evironment or the character models (i.e. the zombies), but the effects are pretty superb as well. In addition to that, the color scheme all-together visual style of the game is just amazing. You can look through my screenshots to see what I mean.\n\nThe gamplay is exactly what you would expect, with an interesting flourish that relates back to the visuals. When you shoot a zombie with your sniper rifle, you have a certain likelihood that it will do an x-ray style kill-cam. Let me just say, that while it might get old after a while, it is very impressive to see. There are so many little details that you may not even notice at first. The bones will shatter in certain patters, lungs will deflate, eyes will pop out of sockets, blood will splatter and trail in the path the bullet takes after exiting, which will also twirl around, mangled and dented from impact. Did I mention the exploding heart, kidneys, and testicals? Now, I realize that's pretty violent, and obviously if this kind of thing makes you squeamish, but you still want to play, then you have the option to disable the kill-cam altogether. There are also some boss fights that are really fun as well. I'd say if this game had a weakness in the gameplay department, it would probably be that sometimes there are just -too many- zombies. They definitely go a little overboard, and some stages can drag, when you wish they would just end. I imagine most people will take breaks playing the game between stages because it really does fatigue you a bit.\n\nThe music is pretty good, but not particularly memorable. Not much to say there. The zombies actually sound pretty scary when they are chanting or screaming or what have you. Probably the most appealing part of the sound design are the guns. They sound good, they sound powerful, just as they should.\n\nNow, where this game falls short...? The story. Were you expecting a story? You shouldn't be. I realize that we can get snobbish and start demanding good stories from everything under the sun these days, but really, I don't think it's necessary for every game that comes out. It has a plot, it's pretty weak, but it's not abhorrent considering the kind of game it is.\n\nAltogether, I really enjoy this game. It's great. I'll give it a solid 7/10. For me, that's a recommendation with an asterisk. Like I said, if you read the sentece from the beginning of this review, then you know exactly what you're getting, and if that's what you're looking for, then you're going to be pleased. If not, well then better to skip this and move on to something else.","March 3, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Les mêmes maps sont légèrement modifiées, mais s'y ajoutent une tripotée de zombie plutôt sympa. Du squelettes assez casse pied avec ses mouvements inattendus, en passant par un sniper jumper plutôt sympa, un nazi heavy, et des bombers complètement tarés.\nLe jeu se compose de seulement 5 missions d'une durée raisonnable, il vous faudra 4 heures environ pour les faire à fond en coopération bien sur, parce que n'essayez pas en solo... en plus d'être difficile ce n'est pas très amusant.\nIl vous faudra entre 10 et 15 heures de jeu pour le mettre à 100%, ce qui prend le plus de temps est le kill des 5000 zombies. Mise à part ça aucune difficulté sur les succès.\nLe niveau de rejouabilité après avoir fait tous les succès est assez faible, les maps sont assez répétitives, et à part pour aider un ami à avoir tous les succès je ne pense pas le relancer. Cela dit ça reste un bon petit jeu coop, assez simple et défoulant. A se procurer.","July 21, 2013","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

In short - great coop, tons of fun. If you like  killing hordes of zombies in the entourage of WWII - buy it.\n\nAnd now in more detail. I bought NZA when it was on sale, just didn't hear about it before, but have played Sniper Elite 2 though and liked it. Now I want you to get one important thing: I didn't read any reviews whatsoever, because if I did, I probably wouldn't have bought it. In my opinion, the scores I've seen for this game on the web - from 40s to 60s, are extremely low and I just don't know why. The game IS fun to play, both single or with friends. While it doesn't offer almost any story, the atmosphere in the game is just how it should be. It's heavy and you feel it. Sometimes it gets scary and very oppressing in SP and that is just what I was looking for, because it didn't feel this way in L4D. And in the multiplayer it gets really intense, because the number of zombies is multiplied to the number of players.\n\nIf you can't decide whether you need to buy it or not - just watch some gameplay videos.

It may seem that this is only a cheap cash-in on the whole 'Nazi zombie' craze, but NZA is actually the best one out there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/josephhicks/recommended/227100/","josephhicks","Joseph Hicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/josephhicks/","448 products in account","IMHO, THIS is a zombie game.\n\nI felt pity towards the zombies. The mood really drives the point home that zombies are horrible, abominations of hell, and becoming one is a fate worse than death itself. I've actually felt sad for the folks that ended up as zombies, and the fact that I was one of the few, last living souls in the entirety of WW2 Germany.\n\nSure, the first chapter feels dull and generic, with the lack of a proper introduction or backstory and a visibly linear design, but the game picks up on the second chapter and gets better on all aspects all the way to the end. The x-ray camera for headshots and vitals make it extremely satisfying to shoot through a horde of zombies. Causing exposed fractures and spraying brain matter all over the place has never been this satisfying.\n\nThe end was a bit disappointing, feels like a sequel hook, but not nearly enough to offset all the fun I had during the game. I can see this being awesome in multiplayer.\n\nAs Eurogamer Spain puts it: "This spin-off removes all the filling to keep only what's important: the sniper rifle, the x-ray camera and lots of stupid enemies."\n\nRecommend.","July 20, 2013","true","9.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/227100/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is a third-person shooter which focuses on cooperative up to four players, albeit it can be beaten in singleplayer too. It was developed by Rebellion and released in 2013. It's a spin-off title of Sniper Elite V2 and one would say that it feels like mod or DLC to it.\n\nA thing to note is that when they released Nazi Zombie Army 2 they backported changes from it to the first game. That means that now you have all the grain effects, zombies have yellow shiny eyes and the Preacher weapon got changed. The Preacher always looked like a good old double shotgun, but in original version it actually was some kind of double-rifle, shooting very strong single bullet. Ever since the update it now behaves the way it looks - boomstick.\nKinda shame, as I would have prefered if the first game was kept unique compared to sequel.\n\nMultiplayer community appears to be quite alive. From what little time I tried it, it would always find one lobby. And after a while it would get filled with few more players. Yes, they can join even when the game is in the process. But I guess that there may be times when there isn't anybody playing.\n\nAnd yes, in this game you go through the linear levels and sometimes get locked into area during siege event. And yep, no plot, pretty much. Aside from Hitler released evil somehow and now you have to escape Berlin over 5 levels. Maybe Fegelein will know how to stop him in a sequel, hmm. And yes, you shoot many zombies. And skeletons.\n\nOne thing for sure, it has an awesome setting, even if it may get old. It's like a zombie-demons B-Movie old cheesy experience, you can tell that developers weren't taking themselves seriously. Tons of slow slumbering zombies to headshot. Lots of occult and demonic things spread over the levels, with corpses and blood everywhere, giving no care that there is way too much for it to makes sense. Dense colorful fog is covering the ground, it all looks moody and lighting is spread around to give off menacing shadows.\nAnd most wonderful of it all is a soundtrack. It's a freaking spooky raving synth combined with piano. Awesome!\n\nAnd yea, gameplay is great for coop. Though you can see that it was based on Sniper Elite v2 engine without much changes. You can still snipe, but instead of having to snipe due to distance, you will do it to accurately hit zombies into head. And due to close quarters, you will use the unscoped aiming of sniper rifle, by holding Left Ctrl button. And yea, headshotting zombies is important, otherwise they take few shots to die and can even revive again if their brains aren't blown. Sometimes it throws special zombies at you, which helps to vary it up. Even though it has a bit too much pure normal zombies encounters.\nSadly, there is no randomization, but it's still fun.\n\nAnd yea, due to it being on Sniper Elite V2 it kept some strange things. For example, you can still stick to the cover, which is completely useless in this title. Well, almost, aside from rare case where I got pinned down by zombie snipers. As well as having to scavenge zombies body for ammo which takes few seconds gets really annoying, seeing how many zombies you kill. You just get really bored of it after a while, but then you may run out of ammo. On other hand, explosive traps fit to this game very very much. They are awesome and a well placed and well timed combination of explosive and dynamite can end lifes of dozens dozens zombies.\nIt does however not include any kind of stealth elements. It makes sense, but still will make you wonder about "Sniper Elite" part.\n\nSadly, singleplayer feels more of throw so people will not moan about lack of it. They don't even have achievements for beating any chapter in single anyway. There are no bots in this game and being solo isn't exciting. All the filler encounter with only normal zombies get very monotonous, since there is only you on battlefield. Heck, I even felt that difficulty and pacing was uneven. The first level's siege were actually the hardest and most fun ones in the game. Or it's the way it felt from beating campaign once. And heck, killcams that were praised in Sniper Elite V2 get annoying here in no end.\n\nSo yes, fun little spin-off but only in cooperative mode and it gets monotonous after a while. However, you should get Zombie Army Trilogy which includes campaign of this game.\nP.S. It has different balance from ZAT. In ZAT kicks are much stronger, non-rifles are weaker, skeletons die from one kick.","March 21","true","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

More numerous than it's sequel but with a little less threat due to the map design I feel, it can still be quite overwhelming at times. Sadly as purely a campaign it can get repetitive and lacks that long term replayability (as do most similar games).\n\nWhat it really excels at is co-op play, and was clearly designed to be played on max difficulty with max players. Potentially a bit easier due to the ability to revive each other, don't let your guard down as you can quickly get overwhelmed by seemingly endless hordes. Sniper rifles versus slow moving targets may sound easy but they do a very good job of shuffling and swaying out of the way, providing some frustration at times.\n\nIn single player the music combined with the blood-soaked, corpse ridden environment can get a bit creepy at times, but co-op turns it from more horror to action.","March 5, 2015","true","14.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A lot.\nDefinitely would recommend you to buy it although it would be nice to get the game with at least 10~25% off.\n\nIt's a pretty simple and straight foward game, you just need to go from point A to point B and kill the zombies along the way.\nThere are some little twists here and there, like when you'll need to hold your position and kill hordes of zombies trying to siege your position or some boss battles.\n\nEven though all the levels are pretty much linear I really enjoyed how they were crafted specially for the use of sniper rifles. There are lots of open spaces, long corridors and high places where you'll find yourself being able to effectively shoot zombies in the head all the time.\n\nBy the way killing zombies, the central point of the game, feels nice. You may get sick of it if you play the game for more than 3~4 hours straight, though. But overall killing zombies in this game is really satisfying.\n\nIt took me about 10 hours to finish the game on normal difficulty on single player mode. The game has a lot of replayability and also a focus on co-op with 3 other players but unfortunately I don't have any friends so I can't say much about the co-op.\nI'll definitely play through it again in the future.\n\nSumming up: In spite of the game feeling incomplete, it is a great game with a lot of replayability. It may get monotonous after a while but I definitely recommend it, mainly if you enjoy sniper rifles or games like Left 4 Dead and killing floor.\nIf possible, buy it when it's in sale.","March 6, 2014","true","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The price was right as well at only 14.99 though I bought it half price during a steam sale, I could have paid 30 for it and it still would have been worth it, its loaded with tons of ghoulish zombies and you have a well stocked arsenal of weapons to choose from while dealing death back to the undead. But what seperates this zombie shooter from all the rest is the trademark bullet cam feature you get from the developers of Sniper Elite, you literally watch your bullet find its way to the chosen target and watch as it explodes through the zombies skulls and other vital bodily parts, wicked fun!

Do not make the mistake of playing it because you like the sniper elite series, this is a completely different series which shares little more than the name)\n\nThe goodDecent weapon mechanics\nGood amount of different weapons\nWell-playable in both multiplayer and alone\nNice visuals, though with an abundance of green and redThe not so goodWeapon variety boils down to very small differences, to the extent that you can pick them just based on which sound you like more\nNot at all playable on lower-end machines\nBasic difficulty settings don't amount to much, supposed sniper elite difficulty can be played without much of a hassle*\nBorderline insulting voice acting\nNo tips during gameplay (far as I could tell) Which can result in somewhat frustrating, repetitive play\nEven though you have no allies in single-player mode, the cutscenes will still show you with all 3 of them. Not a real issue, but it seems worth noting.\nOnly a campaign mode, which limits it's replayability\nMap triggers sometimes fail to go off at the right time (leaving you waiting for the next wave of enemies / to be allowed into the next area)\n*you can change the enemy settings to multiplayer amounts in singleplayer, which I'm assuming just adds more of them\n\nOverall I'd still say it's worth playing, but at this point I would of course recommend you'd just buy the trilogy version.","August 22, 2015","true","35.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A lot.\nDefinitely would recommend you to buy it although it would be nice to get the game with at least 10~25% off.\n\nIt's a pretty simple and straight foward game, you just need to go from point A to point B and kill the zombies along the way.\nThere are some little twists here and there, like when you'll need to hold your position and kill hordes of zombies trying to siege your position or some boss battles.\n\nEven though all the levels are pretty much linear I really enjoyed how they were crafted specially for the use of sniper rifles. There are lots of open spaces, long corridors and high places where you'll find yourself being able to effectively shoot zombies in the head all the time.\n\nBy the way killing zombies, the central point of the game, feels nice. You may get sick of it if you play the game for more than 3~4 hours straight, though. But overall killing zombies in this game is really satisfying.\n\nIt took me about 10 hours to finish the game on normal difficulty on single player mode. The game has a lot of replayability and also a focus on co-op with 3 other players but unfortunately I don't have any friends so I can't say much about the co-op.\nI'll definitely play through it again in the future.\n\nSumming up: In spite of the game feeling incomplete, it is a great game with a lot of replayability. It may get monotonous after a while but I definitely recommend it, mainly if you enjoy sniper rifles or games like Left 4 Dead and killing floor.\nIf possible, buy it when it's in sale.","March 6, 2014","true","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But I can't.\n\nSniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army sounds great when you say it out loud. It looks great written or typed.\nWhile Nazi Zombie Army sounds like a great idea to improve an already great game, it completely fails here. SE:NZA should be a great game, but sadly, it isn't.\n\nEverything that made Sniper Elite fun - is missing. There's no setup, no planning, no eliminating the odd patrolling enemy to get closer to your target, no setting up traps. Its just a 3rd person corridor shooter with a Sniper rifle, 10 mags of ammo, a SMG and 2 spare magazines, and your handgun and a dozen spare mags.\n\nI didn't get to do any real sniping apart from blowing away the odd half dozen Nazi Zombies while moving from horde fight to horde fight. And in those horder fights, I just used partial zoom to blow them away, used the SMG or Shotgun when they got too close, or rounded them into a circle and lobbed a grenade at them.\n\nFor a series that revolves around sniping and stealth for its main selling points, NZA doesn't even bother trying to include them into its gameplay. Whats even worse is that I had more fun playing the various Call of Duty zombie survial modes.\n\nGoing to leave this brain dead game to rot in a dark corner of my library, and go back to the true Sniper Elite roots.","March 29, 2015","false","2.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

This would be perfect if the zombies were slower, there were at least 10X less of them, and some of them didn't have SNIPER RIFLES and MACHINE GUNS. As you try to snipe a few zombies to clear a path to the next saferoom, (which you will spend most of your time looking for), suicide bomber zombies run at close to the speed of light towards you, and the next half-hour you spend will be staring at your friend's back in greyscale while he/she does the same. As stated before, attempting to fend them off with shotguns and other scopeless weapons is friutless effort, they refuse to die, the cover is useless, explosive tripmines take far too long to set up, and the aiming is shoddy and based on faith.\n\nIn conclusion, a game for people who enjoy suffering, and anger.","February 27, 2014","false","1.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/227100/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Nazi Zombie Army is a fun game. You team up with 3 people and you start shooting Nazi zombie soldiers throughout the 5 chapters the game offers. As opposed to "regular" zombie games this one explains zombies by the good-old occultism background that gives the game a more creepy atmosphere: zombies have glowing eyes and the demonic laughter they occasionally produce can give everybody the creeps.\n\nEliminating these otherworldly creatures with precision aiming is very exciting - wind is not taken into account as was in the original Sniper Elite games; this is as casual as it can get. Also, I liked how the developers tried to make this game authentic - objects and places feel realistic and you can really feel being part of an apocalyptic WW II era.\n\nAnd here comes the bad part: Finding players online is extremely difficult. I read many forums and I know there is a relatively big community and really wants to keep playing this game. I also had the chance of playing with 3 people several times only to find myself disconnected once a chapter ended. Some of these were friends on Steam and while chatting with them they confirmed having being disconnected. Playing the game alone is simply too difficult and boring - also, some achievements can only be attained in cooperative gameplay.\n\nIf you want to play this game badly I suggest not only to wait for a big discount but also to gather at least 3 friends who want to desperately play it. With the 4 of you playing it together you can manage to have fun throughout but even with friends you'll experience disconnection several times.\n\nIn addition to this the game also has a handful of bugs and glitches. I find it difficult to recommend a game that is marred by so many issues.","March 7, 2014","false","8.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

So Ill vote YES for the most part. The other parts are just nuances Ill get into in a moment.\n\nSo you are back in Berlin and it's a Zombie Army you are fighting. There are 5 maps to go through and I can say, this is a pretty EVIL game. Single player is pretty good and you can have up to 4 players in Multiplayer. Unfortunately when you play single player, you are alone. Unlike Left 4 Dead where you have 3 other AI's with you. This would have proved interesting for harder levels. But that's not the case. So that is one of my quirks. Once you get use to the gameplay, it's pretty straight forward. Zombies come at you and no use using stealth for the most parts. It's not going to work. They just come right for you. So keep your hearbeat down for any quick sprints you may need.\n\nThe graphics are amazing! You are welcomed into the game with one of the most beautiful creeps scenes ever put on a game. Foggy everywhere and it's NIGHT time for this whole game. So I as usual, bought this on a discount and worth the $5. But one can easily be bored with single player, so let's head to multiplayer.\n\nMultiplayer is GREAT! Harder levels are easier with other live players. I breezed though the elite levels pretty fast. You have the options if you start a server on how many enemies you want 1-4x per person. That means 4 enemies per person if you choose 4x. But this can prove fatal becasue it seems servers are not really reliable and people lose the connection. They do eventually come back in, but sometimes the damage is done. AND I do see issues with delay. I find myself losing bullets fast when I shoot a good shot, but it doesn't register. Again, a few small issues.\n\nThe music in the game is incredible. Sort of a 80's sound to it a little bit, but it is suiting to the game. Have a listen if you can.\n\nHope you enjoy the game\n\n\nUPDATE on multiplayer and lag.\nWell I believe it depends where you are player and where the server is. I have noticed that if I create the server, my lag is gone basically, and even other players don't have a problem.","February 15","true","33.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

It also has the added fear factor of using a sniper rifle, in close quarters, against hordes of the undead. Others may say the special infected such as snipers or gunners are the game's downfall, but I think it makes it more challenging, thus better. If you try to run inscreaming yolo, you will be torn to shreds. If you stand back and pick off the zombies one by one, you will burn through more ammo, yes, but you will be able to waltz right through the next checkpoint after. Ressurecting zombies are annoying, but they can be prevented from a headshot (even before they ressurect). Although the maps were taken right from the campaign, Rebellion reimagined them with the look of an apocalypse. The weapons provided are very balanced, so no player will have a huge advantage over another. X-ray kill cams even got a zombification, so if you wanna see zombie testicles explode, this is the game for you. 9/10","August 23, 2014","true","47.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game really is something. But before I start I know I haven't put alot of time into this so this is a first impressions and they are not very good. First it is the most repetitive games I have ever played. Let me explain the concept of this game. You run to area then "Survive the Seige" or "Clear the area" then run to a safe house get ammo, then you just rinse and repeat. Second the game has some extremaly weird framerate issues. I randomly loose 30 frames for no reason and I get around 15 frames when I aim at the ground. Yet I get solid 60 frames when looking at an extremaly large hoard of zombies. Third the graphics, more importantly the fog. Some areas you can't even see anything because of how much fog there is. Also to me, it seems to have some weird film grain affect making it look like crap. Fourth even though this doesn't ruin the game, I feel like in a game called Sniper Elite you would think a sniper would be useful and affective but it's not, at least for me. I find it so much easier to use the automatic weapons instead. Now I do give them some props for trying to put in things to mix it up a bit like zombies with guns and skeletons that have to be shot in the heart to kill them but it doesn't do much. I actually find fighting the regular zombies more enjoyable because the others are extremaly annoying to fight in my opinion. Something I did enjoy was just lobbing grenades and blowing up a crowd of zombies, but the character seems to like to chuck them as hard as he can and the grenades end up behind the zombies... Any way these are my first impressions of the game. Thanks for reading!

It lacked a decent story and had limited gameplay. Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is what Sniper Elite V2 should have been. It’s just so much better killing hordes of zombies instead of a few sparse groups of Nazis. The same weapons are present (+ a few new ones I think), and the same equipment is available. Gameplay is identical to Sniper Elite V2 which fits in nicely to the survival genre. The enemies are more varied, some are suicidal, some are over-sized, some are extremely fast. There’s a good diversity to fight, and plenty of weapons to use (mostly rifles of course). The rifles don’t differ that much, some hit harder, some fire faster, but all of them kill zombies effectively. The bullet cam returns with it’s amazing x-ray kill shot  mode, this time with a decaying zombie corpse!\n\nThere’s a single player campaign which is fun to play, but the co-op campaign is where you get your real money’s worth. Enemy density is determined by how many players are in the match, so 2 players means a challenge, and 4 players means prepare for a massacre :P It really is fun to battle the zombie apocalypse alongside friends. The levels are linear, but quite large to allow different options and vantage points for all players. With only 5 missions, the campaign won’t last long, but Sniper Elite difficulty will have you coming back if you’re thirsty for a challenge.\n\nA great standalone game that was worth the pre-order, and something that I‘ll be playing with friends until that ♥♥♥♥♥y elite difficulty has been beaten.\n","March 2, 2013","true","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Duh, gue orang Indonesia.\n\nSKOR: 6 dari 10\nDetailnya...\n\nKesan pertama: LAG! yup, entah kenapa game ini lag banget di laptop gue. Settingnya pada saat itu reso 1366 dan HIGH. FPS nya bisa mencapai 5-10. Bener bener unplayable. Gue search di forum dan google, ternyata benar... seri ini bisa dibilang 'tidak terlalu' support dengan laptop. So gue musti nurunin reso sampai 800 dan LOW. Akhirnya bisa stabil di 30-40fps. Tapi setelah beberapa misi, akhirnya perlahan gue naikin reso-nya sampai 1200 dan bisa stabil di 30-40fps. Bug? entah lah...\n\nGrafik: pada dasarnya suasananya bener bener terasa banget perang dunia ke dua. Bangunan hancur, gelap, dan mistis mistis begitu. Banyak juga korban perang dan berbagai macam api dari bangunan yang hancur. Detail nya juga cukup kuat, banyak banget darah dan berbagai macam ornamen seperti ketika zaman tahun 1940an, mulai dari buku-buku tua, perabotan, bentuk gedung, dan berbagai macam alat perang lainnya. Point yang paling menakjubkan adalah KILL CAM. Sensasi ketika lo menembak headshot zombie secara slow motion itu bener-bener-BENER memuaskan banget.\n\nGameplay: BORING! Dari awal sampai akhir tugas lo adalah mengambil senjata, mengisi peluru, dan menembak zombie. Misinya pun cuman 'disuruh kesana, ambil item, dan survive'. Dari awal game sampai akhir game begitu. Bahkan senjatanya pun tidak begitu berpengaruh. So far gue berani bilang senjatanya mirip semua. Rifle, secondary rifle, dan hand gun. Walau pun ada granade, mine, dsb buat gue gak begitu berpengaruh. Gameplay juga kurang begitu memicu adrenalin karena kebanyakan waktu adalah lo mencari tempat yang aman untuk bertahan, lalu menembaki zombie yang BERJALAN menunu diri lo. Memang sih ada beberapa zombie yang mempunyai kemampuan spesial tapi buat gue... piece of cake. OMG CONTROL-NYA SUSAH BANGET. Entah kenapa aim nya begitu susah. Heloooooo ini game sniping lho... kalau aim nya susah, gimana mau headshot? bukan karena kurang/terlalu sensitif, tapi bener bener... GAK BANGET.\n\nStory: LAME! Cerita dari game ini bener bener sama sekali gak kuat. Gak ada background nya dan narasinya kurang. Seakan akan game ini itu membeli 'lisensi' untuk menggunakan nama NAZI lalu... selesai. Serius. Gitu doang.\n\nSkor yang gue berikan adalah 6.\nKenapa? Karena masih cukup menghibur dengan grafik dan KILL CAM nya. Yup, pada dasarnya cuman dua itu doang yang ditawarkan oleh game ini.\n\nApakah pantas dibeli dengan harga $14?\nBIG NO! Dengan uang segitu lo bisa membeli game yang JAUUUUUH lebih keren daripada game ini. Saran gue, lo sebaiknya membeli game ini ketika harganya didiskon hingga menjadi kurang dari $5.","March 5, 2014","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

I will get NZA 2 when on sale.\n\nVery good graphics and level design, good sound and camera. Excellent for Eyefinity but some poor stereoscopic compatibility.","March 10, 2015","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is quite repetitive, and the cillcam for great shots happens way too often and turns annoying after a while. Unlike the title suggests real sniping happens rarely. Most of the time the player runs around shooting at really close Zombies; The wind-gravity-thing that sniper elite usually offers is never notable here.\nAlso the game requires a good PC to run, even if the graphics are crap. Especially if there are those damn skeletons near, the frame rate drops from 30 to 18, what makes those Bas*ards hard to kill.\n\nCoop is really hard (and might lag) and with the few siege moments and freaking boss fights a reason for me to still give the game a 6.5/10 rating.\nI will play it again with a better PC in future.","June 26, 2013","true","13.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

Where 95% of the time you kill a zombie with a rifle you will have to watch a five-eight second long bullet cam. It's cool the first few times but having to choose from never seeing it at all or seeing it with every single kill aren't exactly ideal options.\n\nRegarding the controls, I can't really complain. Pretty decent.\nThe game has an alright variety of different weapons to use (your main weapon will be a rifle) and traps.\nVery few types of enemies.\nCreepy and spooky atmosphere and sounds (one of the better things about this game in my opinion).\nNazi Zombie Armys story seems like it could have potentional but falls flat on almost every step of the way. Obviously you're not playing a zombie game for the long, deep and emotional story though (not that this game has one).\n\nOf course, the zombie killing! The reason why you want to play a zombie game. If you're fond of incredibly repetive, long and boring horde modes where literally all you have to do is stand still and shoot at zombies for about 15 minutes, then run for five minutes then stand still and kill zombies for 15 more minutes then this is a game for you.\n\nIn all fairness, it is "kinda" fun to play with friends but that's it. It's generally just not a good game. Defiently not worth the full price and should only be bought if you plan to play with friends (the main focus of the game).\n\n+\nControls\nVisuals\nAudio\n\n-\nGameplay\nStory\nNeed to play co-op to have any fun\nAmount of different enemies\nUnsatisfying, boring and completely repetive combat purely to lengthen the hours of gameplay.\n\nDefiently not recommend this game.","December 8, 2013","false","5.3"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","5"

This is an utterly sickening title and don't ever let the "Co-op campaign" convince you to get this horrific title (no pun intended). It is a stain on the good name of the Sniper Elite series that never should have been made. The story is just plain horrible and generic, the graphics are subpar, and the gameplay is bland. So just no, no matter what its priced, never ever buy this game.

The game basically throws enemies at you in large waves, who will home in on your exact location, and you often have to resort to your sub-weapons to fight. This eventually includes sprinting enemies and suicide bombers.\n\nI spent more time doing everything EXCEPT sniping. I tried really hard to enjoy this game, but once I got to a part that threw an extremely difficult enemy that required multiple headshots to kill, I knew it was time to call this game quits. It's extremely frustrating because Sniper Elite V2 is an extremely excellent game otherwise. This game is fine example of how NOT to do DLC.\n\nhot garbage/10.

All I got was waiting for the fun part and the game ended.\nFirstly it's short - it has 5 chapters that you will finish in 4-5 hours. All the missions are: "go there", "pick that and defend", "defend", "go there and clear the area". Literally... The story was cut in half to sell the sequel, there's even a "buy NZ:A2" button in the main menu and a popup that tells you to do so... About the zombies: there are a few types that you will encounter million times in every mission: normal walkers, snipers, suicide bombers, minigunners and skeletons. You will be sick of them after a map. There's a boss, too. He spawns even more zombies and does nothing, but stay in one place and wait till you shoot him. Ofcourse he appeared twice - why make 2 bosses when you can reuse the first one? Guns - every weapon feels the same, there's no point in choosing any other weapon (except shotguns). Grenades and traps are cool though. So yeah, that's the entire game. Super repetetive, no replay value.

Will you want to play this game or will you want to stick to the originals ?\n\nStory wise there's not much story at all. You can play up to 4 different characters who have to escape Berlin which is filled with Zombies Hitler woke up from the dead, it's just absurd as it sounds.\n\nGameplay wise it's an identical re skin of Sniper Elite V2. Nothing is changed. The game now focuses on close quarters combat. Trust me when I say this. It's not fun when a horde of zombies gang up and try to kill you and the only thing you have to defend yourself with is a sniper rifle. The are two types of boss battles. One is a big guy zombie who was  a machine gun and it's best to snipe him from afar and there is a poltergeist type boss which can spawn enemies in the area you are fighting in.\n\nMusic is alright for the most part. It feels like a great reference to 80's horror movies and a throwback to classic zombie flicks.\n\nGraphics wise, it's an identical clone to Sniper Elite V2. Even some of the levels are ripped straight from V2. All that is changed is that all levels take place during the night and it has this weird greenish filter on top of it.\n\nThe game took me 6 hours to finish the entire campaign in Co Op mode.  There is some replay value if you want to find hidden collectibles. Otherwise there is zero replay value.\n\nThe game is pretty difficult due to the unfair nature of the enemy placement. I will refer to one of the experiences I had while playing the game. During the 4th mission of the game right before the end of the mission I had to go through a closed door. As soon as I opened it I got downed instantly by 7 zombies before I could even react. Not to mention if you play Co Op you have less checkpoints and if you ♥♥♥♥ up you might have to redo entire sections of a level to get back to the part where you failed.\n\nLevel Design is alright for the most part. Some levels have massive open area's in which it's hard to get swarmed which is nice.\n\nThe game is incredibly buggy. I had ton's of bugs during the time I played the game. Like enemies glitching through walls. The game not letting me pick up items and more stuff like that.\n\nOverall I wish there was a middle option for this game, cause while I don't find it completely horrible, I don't find it good either. It get's boring really soon and there's a lot wrong with the game. In the end this game is made only for the massive fans of Sniper Elite games. If you are a fan of the Sniper Elite games you will love this game. But I still suggest waiting for a discount before buying this game. I give Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army a 5/10","October 1, 2015","false","7.2"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","7","17","0","0"

However, you need to be careful if you're considering buying this game, as it is horribly optimized. Even with everything turned down as low as it can go, my rig simply cannot keep up. I'm positive I meet the minimum requirements, but minimum is NOT enough for a good time.

I love the beautiful graphics.  But best of all, the gameplay is excellent.  This game offers a challenging, and intense adventure while trying to survive the never ending horde of Nazi zombies everywhere.  This game is best played with friends in coop mode, although playing in single player mode is much more fun.\n\nEDIT:  March 19, 2014\n\nAfter trying out this game with a few of my friends I can honestly say, STAY AWAY FROM IT!  Everything is great until you start to play Cooperative Mode.  Laggy as hell, you get dropped by the game so many times, it just becomes outright frustrating.  The other Major problem is communication between players.  There is no OPTION in the game to make it OPEN MIC and so the Push To Talk becomes tedious and very upsetting.  We have never been able to finish the game because of one glitchy problem after the next.  You shoot a zombie, and u feel like your shooting blanks.  the shots won't register for about 2 full seconds.  A delay that none of us care for.  And people have left the game because it's just too much trouble.  There's no real checkpoint where u can start over again without ending up in the beginning of the level again.  and there are no options for this either.  What is sad is that this game could've been perfect if there were updates to fix these so called glitches.  Yet, they still exist.  If there is no support for this game, i think STEAM should STOP selling it.  Nobody wants to pay for an UNSUPPORTED GLITCHY game that later u will just want to bury it deep in it's own grave along with the glitchy zombies.  What a disappointment.

There is none of that apart from shooting the occasional bottle for and achievment.\nVariety - A large choice of rifles, sub-machine guns and pistols, although it gives minimal information or stats about each gun so you don't know which to choose for the way you'd like to play (fast but not much damage, do lots of damage but slower paced etc.) In terms of killing things, there isn't alot of variety in that either. You get the zombies with the special abilities (e.g. suicide bombers, ones with more health and such), but apart from that you're basically doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Also very short game.\nThere's sweet kill cams like in every sniper elite game, but If you want kill cams, go for Sniper Elite 3 or Sniper Elite V2 as these ones aren't really that good. Plus it's not as satisfying when you get a bullet cam from 2 feet away. But when playing Sniper Elite V2, shooting at an enemy sniper a mile away and then instantly getting the bullet cam is so much better, since\nyou kind of actually earned the bullet cam instead of getting it every other kill.\nStory - There is no dialogue in cutscenes. It's literally just 4 blokes standing around with the same facial expression for each character. Also there is no story\nConclusion - Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army isn't a very good game, since they basically put no effort into making it a different game to the others. It's basically an expansion pack displayed as a whole new different game (when it isn't).\nIf you like to mindlessly kill zombies over and over again and like to watch bullets penetrate various internal organs and testicles, then this game is for you. But if you want a better Sniper experience, then I would go for the actually sniper games (Sniper Elite V2 or 3)\nThank you for reading and I hope this helps towards your decision of buying this game.

The music in this game is the best Zombie music in a game I have ever heard outside a movie.\nLike most sniper games these enemies exhibit unrealistic erratic movements, their heads move about so rapidly its difficult to get a well placed shot, ever wonder how to screw up a zombie game?  This is how.  Skeletons run at you with one spot to shoot and it MOVES all over the place!\n\nAmmo:  There just isnt enough in this game, when you shoot an enemy they droop ammo but all the enemies are grouped together, so that means running into groups of hungry zombies to get ammo only to have it disappear in front of you.  Worse than the disappearing ammo is that if another teammate grabs what little ammo is in the open, its gone.  The best way to get ammo is going all the way back to the safehouse, but who would think you can do that with all the invisible walls everywhere else, plus at times it can be pretty far back.\n\nRating:  2/10  Value:  $2.99","April 25, 2013","false","7.1"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

Although the game is very fun while playing solo, I can see the game being much more fun playing with friends for strategies can be employed and of course you can alter the game to spawn many more zombies than normal.\n\nThere are multiple difficulties to choose from as well as zombie counts to be changed, the more players you play with, the more zombies you can add.  Of course you can play solo on the hardest difficulty with the most amount of zombies but I do not recommend it.  Each zombie count available to choose is titled for how many players you're playing with, so for an example the 3-Player zombie count is recommended for 3 player.\n\nOverall this game is a very fun zombie game recommended to be played with friends but can also be played solo if you're a zombie fanatic.","August 16, 2014","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ikrani/recommended/227100/","ikrani","Ikrani","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ikrani/","37 products in account","Kiss realism goodbye, because this game does not give two sheits about plausibility.\n\nWhile the campaign may only have a few levels, each one of those levels is a good length with a variety of ways to maim, maul and murderize the opposing undead, ranging from blowing them up with dynamite to making their heads explode with your side arm. Ammo is harder to find for some weapons, so constantly relying on your submachine gun and sidearm can sometimes get you into a tight spot.\n\nHeadshots are really the only way to ensure the undead stay dead, lest they comeback to life. There are certain areas where what appear to be already-dead bodies turn out to be not-quite-dead-yet bodies, adding to the level of tension as you have to go around seeking sleeping corpses to put down while conserving your precious ammo. Those zombies you do kill disintegrate after a while, meaning you have to divide your time between fighting and looting ammo before it vanishes.\n\nThe enemies in this game aren't particularly varied, what with two basic grunts, one fast-moving suicide bomber, one heavy weapons zombie (which can be real pain in the ♥♥♥ to kill by yourself), one undead sniper variant who can leap tall buildings in a single bound, and one boss. However, the game makes up for this by keeping the spaces tight and only allowing you breathing room when there's about fifty or so enemies trying to kill you.\n\nThe Slow-Mo camera is there, and while it does keep the game interesting it can get a little annoying after a while when every kill you make is gratuitously showcased for your carnal boredom.\n\nThe only complaints I have are the lack of scenery variety, the lack of enemy variety, and the fact that the characters don't really have much character to grow attached to like their Call of Duty counterparts. These are issues I hope were addressed in this game's sequel. Despite this, Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is still really enjoyable, easily replayable escapist fun.","January 11, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nor did I get them to be honest. Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army is a standalone version of a Sniper Elite v2, and as most of the games futuring zombies, this game is meant to be coop. It's way more interesting playing in 4 characters, rather than playing alone as game tends to get frustrating if you are playing it solo. The difficulties are hard, but what this game wants from you is to make tactic for each level that will determin on if you are gonna succeed or not. Of course, upon playing with your friends, the enemies are stronger, and you have to apply different attitude towards threats.\n\nAnyway, I would recommend this game if you have even one friend to play it with, but if you have more, it's always better. Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army is what I think Call of Duty Zombies mode should've been, with this fluid campaign.\n\n7/10","August 6, 2013","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played for five minutes and I immediately bought it for my friend, who's house I was at at the time. We started playing at about 10 o'clock in the evening. We kept playing for a very long time, and we knew it was very late. I looked out the window after we finished the fourth mission, and I said, "Kyler (my friend).... Dude, Kyler..." He's like, what? I'm like, "Kyler.... it's getting light outside." We look out the window, then I check my watch. It was 7:45 the next morning. We both had around seven hours logged on it. We just started laughing, and then suddenly his dad comes down to leave for work, and asks, "Did you guys get some good sleep?" We started howling, and, realizing we hadn't slept at all yet, he just shook his head and walked away. We went to sleep for two hours and got back up and finished the game around 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon.\n\nIn short, the best zombie game I have ever played, and one of the best games I have played in general. Even when my computer started crashing every 20 minutes or so, I just had him host the game and whenever I crashed he would just pause and wait for me to get back in. Seven hours of a crashing computer, sleeplessness, butt-sore-ness, cramping, aching wrists, and frustration at hard parts, and I would still go back and do it all again. 10/10, for sure. It's extremely strategic at points, where we literally had to make abbreviations just to communicate fast enough to stay alive. "Kami behind." "Skel on right" "Biggy up ahead" "SPAWNING ON US GOSH DANG IT RUN" were all part of our vocabulary all night.\n\nYou know the best part?\n\nI'm still not tired of it and am going to be playing with other friends\n\n\nYou know the second best part?\n\nThere's still the second one to play\n\nSeriously though, 9.5/10. There's a few things that make it that .5 from perfection, but it's aaalmost perfect. One problem is that is kind of the same thing over and over, but each time there's a different strategy, and I don't know why, but I guess if it's your playing style, it just doesn't get old. Insanely fun. People keep saying it's not optimized, and that the mouse will go slow one second, and swing around the next, but I never had that problem, so I can't say much on that account. Seriously, my computer doesn't even run this game properly, and it keeps crashing, but I still try playing it. Such a sweet game","April 13, 2014","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the game is very fun while playing solo, I can see the game being much more fun playing with friends for strategies can be employed and of course you can alter the game to spawn many more zombies than normal.\n\nThere are multiple difficulties to choose from as well as zombie counts to be changed, the more players you play with, the more zombies you can add.  Of course you can play solo on the hardest difficulty with the most amount of zombies but I do not recommend it.  Each zombie count available to choose is titled for how many players you're playing with, so for an example the 3-Player zombie count is recommended for 3 player.\n\nOverall this game is a very fun zombie game recommended to be played with friends but can also be played solo if you're a zombie fanatic.","August 16, 2014","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ammo is harder to find for some weapons, so constantly relying on your submachine gun and sidearm can sometimes get you into a tight spot.\n\nHeadshots are really the only way to ensure the undead stay dead, lest they comeback to life. There are certain areas where what appear to be already-dead bodies turn out to be not-quite-dead-yet bodies, adding to the level of tension as you have to go around seeking sleeping corpses to put down while conserving your precious ammo. Those zombies you do kill disintegrate after a while, meaning you have to divide your time between fighting and looting ammo before it vanishes.\n\nThe enemies in this game aren't particularly varied, what with two basic grunts, one fast-moving suicide bomber, one heavy weapons zombie (which can be real pain in the ♥♥♥ to kill by yourself), one undead sniper variant who can leap tall buildings in a single bound, and one boss. However, the game makes up for this by keeping the spaces tight and only allowing you breathing room when there's about fifty or so enemies trying to kill you.\n\nThe Slow-Mo camera is there, and while it does keep the game interesting it can get a little annoying after a while when every kill you make is gratuitously showcased for your carnal boredom.\n\nThe only complaints I have are the lack of scenery variety, the lack of enemy variety, and the fact that the characters don't really have much character to grow attached to like their Call of Duty counterparts. These are issues I hope were addressed in this game's sequel. Despite this, Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is still really enjoyable, easily replayable escapist fun.","January 11, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

NZA Brings the fun marksmanship-oriented gameplay of Sniper Elite 2 into the grim theater of the zombie apocalypse. Third person shooting action and tense long-range sniper battles with zombie snipers. There are horde-attacks that anyone familiar with zombie games will find familiar and challenging. In addition to the regular zombie engagements and horde defense encounters there are boss fights at the end of the level which are challenging and stress marksmanship, time management and mobility.\n\nMisc:\n\nThe Menu system is a bit clunky and probably could be more intuitive, but it works.\n\nPlaying the game solo is still fun, but the horde engagements and boss fights are really difficult without someone watching your back. I definitely reccomend grabbing a buddy or three and slogging through this one.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nIf you liked sniper elite 2 and left 4 dead, this game is for you. It goes on sale frequently for sub $10 and I think that If you can pick it up for that price-point it's a no brainer, fans of the genre won't be dissapointed purchasing at full market price.","September 9, 2013","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it comes with a long list of pretences. First of all, you NEED to have friends who are willing to play this with you. Preferably friends who are fans of Army of Darkness and similar campy zombie movies. Second, you need to know what you're getting into. NZA isn't a smart game, nor is it an original game. It isn't all that much of a good game either. It's just a little something you and your friends can jump into together for a few hours on a boring, rainy Sunday afternoon. For the cheap price you pay, Nazi Zombie Army is not at all a bad purchase in its own right. It is its own, stand-alone game for the price of a Call of Duty map pack. It looks good, has about the same length as Medal of Honor, and it has four-player Co-Op. The problem is just that, in this day and age, when you can get a retail game for the same price during a Steam daily deal, NZA simply does not hold a candle to the competitors. The game isn't great, some will argue that it isn't even good. I had fun with it, but I purchased it knowing what I was getting into. If you're desperate for more Co-operative zombie action, then you might want to try it out. But if you're new to the genre, you might as well pick up Left 4 Dead 2 instead.\n\n3/5\n\nRead more:\nhttp://pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/sniper-elite-nazi-zombie-army/","November 21, 2013","false","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

La historia es lo más malo que puede existir, de verdad, es la idea más cliché para una trama de zombies, tanto que te deja hasta con mal sabor, sin embargo, sin contar este gran defecto junto con la falta de Cutscenes o dialogos, este juego logra ser bueno debido a su cooperativo de 4 jugadores, lo que se disfruta un montón ya que los zombies nos superan en número y las misiones son extremadamente largas, posibilitando una movilidad y unión entre los jugadores.\n\nSigue todo sus rasgos característicos de la saga, ocupando la X-Ray Cam, increíbles efectos, gráficos alucinantes y una banda sonora (incluyo los efectos de sonido en esto) extraordinaria.\n\nPara la jugabilidad se nos presenta lo mismo de V2, matar y matar, solo que ahora no seguimos la historia inmersiva, el sigilo no sirve de nada, las coberturas casi ni se ocupan (si no me equivoco solo las ocupo cuando hay francotiradores o machinegunners, incluso ahí prefiero solo tirarme al piso o agacharme en algún lado) debido a que ni un enemigo es un real peligro desde larga distancia. Todo es repetitivo, horrible, zombies y mas hordas de ellos, a veces hay momentos en donde aparecen zombies kamikazes o esqueletos, machinegunners, o un jefe que se repite como 3 veces y es basura, pero nada mas interesante. Aún así yo lo disfruto, así que es cosa de gustos creo.\n\nEn conclusión, es un juego normal, aceptable, y su secuela es casi igual, nada muy entretenido aunque la verdad no la he jugado mucho así que aún no puedo opinar totalmente.\n\n6/10","December 26, 2013","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/recommended/227100/","ryanyth","Encephalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/","441 products in account","Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is a standalone game/expansion to Sniper Elite: V2. (You don't need to own V2 to be able to play this one.) It is built from the same engine as V2, featuring the exact same mechanics and gameplay yet features completely separate game modes. Unlike V2 which had 10 missions, this game features a series of 5 campaign missions that can be played in single player or up to four players in online co-op.\n\nThe story involves a "what if" scenario presented during the final days of World War 2, if Adolf Hitler were to deploy a secret last desperate plan to raise the dead as zombies through occult rituals and turn them against the allied forces.\n\nWhile it is not a bad game in itself, fans of the original Sniper Elite V2 will be disappointed that the attention to detail that was given to V2 is not shown here. For instance right in the opening scene, we see Hitler giving orders to his generals in spoken English. That right there sets up the tone of the game. A goofy game set in an alternate universe that is not to be taken too seriously.\n\nThis time, instead of the 3 main tactics of Conceal, Plan and Execute, all you have to do is just aim your gun and shoot anything that moves. No subtlety is required. Enemies will not hide and take up defensive positions. The only thing they do is to stagger slowly at you in massive numbers. Mixed in with the standard zombies are a couple of special mobs such as zombie snipers with super jumps, tank-like machine gunner zombie bosses etc. Throughout the whole game, you just need to shoot at them and move away to avoid getting slashed.\n\nThis just makes every stealth and cover mechanics that was in V2 completely redundant. And because its made from the same engine, the mechanics are still there, but completely worthless as you will never need to utilize them at all.\n\nGraphics wise, the game makes use of existing art resources used in V2, but this time overlaid with a bluish nightmarish tone, which admittedly doesn't look too shabby. Some of the graphics can be abit gory at times and you might want to make a note of that if you want to let younger children play.\n\nSound and music are appropriately creepy sounding. Well, as creepy sounding as you can get when you pump a growling nazi zombie full of lead. No complaints at all about this.\n\nOverall Rating: 6.0 / 10\nI can't help but feel that this game is a cheap cash in using the exact same engine as V2. I'm more then a little disappointed that the game mechanics which had been refined so well in V2 were basically abandoned in this game. Feel free to give this game a couple of points more if this doesn't bother you.\n\nIf you are looking to find a good zombie shooting game, i'd recommend either the L4D series or Killing Floor if you haven't already played them. If however you are looking for something new and don't mind a goofy fictional WW2 arcade shooting game with Nazi Zombies that doesn't take itself seriously, this title might be worth a look.","October 27, 2013","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it may be not the perfect game (it has some glitches and bugs) and definitely the story isn't the best there is around, it's still a very entertaining game, with a lot of hours of fun in it. I mean, after all, it's SHOOTING NAZI ZOMBIES WITH YOUR SNIPER, what else do you need?\n\nGraphics are more than okay, the shadowing is PERFECT (these are the best shadows I've seen so far and I'm not making this up, they look REALLY realistic). When you shoot a zombie it plays a slow-mo animation following the bullet and showing you how the bones and organs of the zombie you shot get pierced by it as the bullet goes through its body, so that adds a nice touch (Sniper Elite v2 has the same animation but with live soldiers- well, not live anymore since you killed them, but well, you still get what I tried to say).\n\nAnd finally the controls are excellent and easy to use.\n\nOverall, it's an excellent game to play with friends, and if you're speaking with them through Skype, TeamSpeak or RaidCall then it's waaaaaaay better!","March 19, 2013","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its awesome not only Zombies but different ones with some firing at you from afar keeping it from just walking targets and then there s that running happy one with the 4th of July salute. Its a classic and fits well with the Sniper Elite setting and concept branching off to Sci Fi without going too far with any future gadget guns. A must and the Co Op is just the way it should play  but you can go Solo but Co Op is more teamwork and strategy from another helps at times////","March 14, 2015","true","89.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, they don't get much in the way here, since cover is rarely a thing you have to worry about (though there are some zombie snipers and gunner zombies; not many).\n\n-The game berating me for inevitably failing to put each of my bullets in the head of a zombie is amusing. "Like a drunk who lost a bet!" It's also nice to shoot a zombie's potato grenade and kill him and his nine best friends, even if that is almost always an accidental hit.\n\n-Don't play single player. It's completely boring and as soon as you start fighting skeletons (very early on) it is basically impossible. Four-player coop is more fun, and does require a little bit of teamwork. For the most part the game is a shooting gallery, but it does scratch an itch.\n\n-I see what people mean by the killcam being the highlight of this series. Unfortunately, it multiplayer it is sped up.\n\nOverall, worth the sale price of $5. It does get a little old after extended play time, but not too bad.","July 13, 2013","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There really isn't too much in the game itself, but it's still a lot of fun to play with friends.\n\nYour character in the game has a sniper (obviously), a gun, and some traps you can set up. You go through each map defeating hordes of zombies and then eventually facing up against a boss. Very simple. The most variety you'll get from this is the different snipers and guns you can use. Some snipers need to reload after each shot, others do not, and they each feel a bit different to use.\n\nAlso, for the individual who likes to 100% complete each map, you can find the gold bars and bottles hidden in the maps (the bottles being in RIDICULOUS locations such as on the top of a building that you'll need your sniper to zoom in on it to even see it, and then possibly having difficulty even sniping the bottle since it's so far).","November 2, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is fun, but isn't a game that you can't put down. Many have said this and it is true that it is very repetitive. I haven't tried it on the hardest difficulty, but on marksman (the normal difficulty) it isn't very challenging. The boss levels are all the same, and there are not many variants of zombie. Finally there isn't much to the story, you appear to be with 3 others, but in single player you are on your own and they come back for the cut scenes. I won't go any further if you are the kind to want to discover the story yourself... I got it on sale for about £3, which is worth it, but I wouldn't pay £10 for it. This all seems very negative, it is fun and pretty mindless, which I kind of like once in a while.

If you really like the Sniper Elite series, it is a decent addition, but there are some significant issues.\n\nI have played with both a mouse and KB, as well as an Xbox controller, and I find the controlls when aiming to be top notch, but while moving....\n\nOk, so the guy runs, but if I am not facing an item directly, he will not pick it up. If I am not facing it correctly, it won't bring up the interaction button for opening doors or searching enemies.  Again, if you are not DIRECTLY facing the specific part of a wall that allows a vault, he will not vault.  THIS IS CRUCIAL!!!\n\nWhy is this so annoying do you ask?  Let me digress a bit...\n\nIn past Sniper games, there is much SNEAKING and PLANNING.\nIn THIS Sniper game, there is much running, and alot less planning.  The zombies come at you in hoards, often with the section you are in being blockaded so you are limited on where you can front an attack.  This does not work well with zombies that do not try to hide, they just keep following you.\n\nSo while you are busy trying to find a good spot to shoot from, you are constantly having to pop a couple and GO!  You cannot stand still for long.\n\nI was expecting more room for strategy, and so far the game is kind of boring me.  Not too much story yet, and like I said, strategy is not really given time to happen.\n\nIf you enjoy the bullet time of Sniper Elite, it is fun to watch zombies get ripped apart.\nBut if you like the sneaking and SNIPER feel to the gameplay, do not expect it so much here.\n\nPick it up on sale, but remember that it is gonna feel like an arcade game, rather than a good Sniper experience.","October 1, 2013","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I love the graphics.\n\nBUT this game lacks the story and tempo or the original game. You are very rushed -- which isn't good for sniping. If you like to spray and pray then wave after wave of zombies is cool. But the problem is that there isn't enough ammo for your secondary weapon in the whole world. The zombies move so erratically that their heads are too hard to hit. A head shot is needed to stop a zombie from regenerating.\n\n\nI have tried again and again and again to beat this game. It is so frusterating. I can't. But I had no problem with the original Sniper Elite. I am at the part where you are trying to get to the church and there are about 50 zombies and one of those big killer machine gun guys. I shoot him time and time again and he never goes down.\n\nWell, I quit. It is just too much especially considering you have to kill so many people each time you die due to the checkpoint placement.","March 12, 2014","false","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very little content, few features. Predictable. Monotonous. Either you get into it, or you find this incredibly boring. A lot of problems from the first two remain. Other than a meh-but-useful kick, no melee.\n\nMy recommendation: Go play L4D2 again. Or if you don't mind its flaws, play Contagion.

I enjoyed it alot and hear the sequel is just as good.\n\nUpdate: It has been a few months since I did the first few parts in co-op and now I have picked it back up solo. I have to say I like the game even more now, alone the tension is stronger and I feel like the only living thing in the game. The game still looks damn good and I turned the kill cams up and enjoy it every time I get an x-ray shot!

Departing from even the regular series stream (which I actually prefer, and which I have enjoyed, as the 'sniper' designation fits those games very well), this is an almost entirely 'shoot em up' based game, which appears to ditch the sniper aspect of the series, referring you instead to level after level of 'survive this horde by blasting them away'.  There's such a serious lack of strategy here, that - after logging in about 5 hours total - I don't think I've been able to play through an entire round (of killing endless mobs of nearly identical enemies), without becoming strikingly bored and disinterested.  Much like the Dead Island series fell flat, and brought its share of disrepute to the zombie/undead game genre, this is a similarly forgettable addition to the zombie gaming series.  For future developers - the golden rule of content in gaming is; if you have nothing unique to add to a genre beyond a mildly entertaining shoot-em-up action game, then you'd best leave it to the developers who have real experience and expertise in the genre, instead of wading into an unfamiliar genre with mixed results at best.  Final verdict - this game is at the level of a free DLC, and little more.","November 17, 2015","false","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to admit that I like this game a lot. The gameplay is player friendly and I just kept on playing and playing. For a tenner it is well worth the purchase. Remember it is only 3 to 5 hours long.  However when a game is cut this smoothly with a nice games engine you simply can't complain for the single player campaigns.  I have played co op a couple of times and you don't seem to have the time to communicate by keyboard. So its mics only,  I'm afraid !!    Also co op seems to suffer some bugs and glitchs but that could be the servers themselves? !   Anyway give it a go and I recommend you should try it on easy then work to normal if you are not to sure.

Instead of shooting wildly, you MUST be accurate with your head shots. Weapons are realistic and ammo hard to find: you must search dead bodies for clips (before they disappear, of course).\n\nStill not hard enough? How about running suicide bomber zombies?\nNo? How about zombie snipers that can jump between buildings?\n\nIf you want a zombie game that delivers you crazy hordes, and requires shooting skills, this is your game.\nOne downside: not a lot of co-op games running, so you may need to end up convincing friends to buy and play.","December 30, 2013","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What made the Sniper Elite series so great was the ability to kill, sneak to another perch, and kill again before anyone found you.  This game is essentially a hack n' slash with none of that genre's strong points.  You simply move from one place to another, killing zombies that mostly materialize on top of you, only to find yourself in a perch where waves of zombies attack you.  If you survive that, you have the "privilege" of making your way to the next perch.\n\nEssentially, it took everything that made being a sniper fun and tossed it out the window, and you are left dealing with an engine that actually inhibits your ability to survive.","August 20, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's about as basic as a game can get - survive the waves of zombies as you make your way through the levels. However what makes it stand out is the sheer mindless fun of getting headshot after headshot as well as the killcam that shows you gratuitous shots of your bullets smashing through zombie skulls - it never gets old and each one is gorier than the last. The level design and graphics are very pretty and it's set up to make you feel increasingly tense as the armies of zombies slowly close in on you.\n\nAs a budget title this game is worth every cent and it is a hell of a lot more polished and addictive than the COD zombie mode.

Sniper Elite V2 is a great game and a blast to play, but this doesn't use anything that made its base game great.\nWhy they took a game about carefully planning your sniping targets, getting into position, and hiting pinpoint targets and then turned it into a game where you almost never get a chance to snipe anything, I have no idea.\nThey even taunt you with interesting sniping targets (like skeletons with still beating hearts), except they spawn those in groups of 4 or more, 30 feet away, and they immedatly start running at you.\nI paid only $5 for this game and I'm still feeling a bit ripped off.","November 12, 2013","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
