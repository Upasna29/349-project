Thought I'd try it out because was quite bored. And it turned out to be my favourite game of the year as of now.\n\nAS a 2D platformer it is quite demanding on your system - however nothing an average system can't manage (integrated graphics cards tend to have little support and in that regard run the game quite sluggishly. if you've got a separate gpu then it's gonna run smoothly). Nonetheless personally I think it's a beautiful game, even stunning. Mechanics are great - very enjoyable fighting, nice variety of weapons available and they all feel different too (a bit too "soft" and "smooth" for heavy guns like a rocket louncher or so, but it's futuristic plasma rounds that you're firing so I think it reflects on that well). Many different kinds of opponents that you will have to figure out how to kill, so it's not too much of a straight 'shoot em up' platformer.\n\nWhere this game really excels is its soundtrack.\nThe atmosphere it creates is simply... breathtaking. As a part of bundle I received it separately as mp3, and am listening to in on a regular basis - it's that good.\nYou will quickly notice that this game is not lengthy. Still it leaves plenty of room for prolongued gameplay, especially if you like picking up achievements and accomplishing everything to perfection.\n\nTo round up, as mentioned I was so blown away by this game - gameplay, soundtrack and (forgot to mention) story wise. Definetely pick it up if you're a platformer fan (imho it doesn't redefine the genre in any way - however it does show that it's still got that kick), and, well, even if you're not. I guarantee you will not be let down.","November 26, 2013","true","7.6"," 45 of 55 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","45","55","0","1"

From your gravity hook, jetpack, anti grav pick ups, moving around truly feels great. It feels a little like Metroid. Due to the aspect of the isloation of an unitentional and forced exploration of a new planet.\n\nSome creatures being hostile and some not. Of course if you want to be crass you can draw comparisons to Terraria and Starbound without the crafting. But the movement and art style, I really like the art style, are enough to distinguish it apart. The weapons are diverse, effective and fun to use. The campaign is level based. Each with different objectives. Some are simple get to a certain location and others task with destroying certain targets or rescue missions for yor fallen comrades. I found that the physics here are slightly at odds with themself as tethering yourself to a human allows you to pull them up and simultaneously jump off of them pulling you both upward. Perhaps this was a happy conceit for pulling your buds out of harms way.\n\nAbsolutely phenomenal soundtrack, It really makes you want to just explore a ♥♥♥♥in cave. Its exciting in a wonderous way. Definitely one of my favorite and more memorable indie games ever.","November 12, 2014","true","5.7"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","37","46","4","0"

As for indie platformer the gameplay is really solid and fun. Every mission just leave player in a vast level with only a compass to navigate, a sheer number of physics based puzzles to solve and eagerly waiting aliens to kill. Yeah, physics have a major part in gameplay, as space around is a vaccum and every action runs differently from how we used to. At this part, I must mark some problems with Capsized.

In fact, it's pretty fair to expect that it'd be a rather difficult experience, but Capsized makes it fun nonetheless. Putting players in the shoes of a space marine lost on an alien world, Capsized hearkens back to the old days of 2d platforming on PC, setting the player to explore the alien landscape, fight off aliens, and solve objectives ranging from finding the exit of alien warrens to destroying idols or rescuing crewmates.\n\nTaking the visual style of Elemental Gimmick Gear and gameplay mechanics from Bionic Commando Rearmed and Alien Hominid, Capsized pits players against enemies of all varieties. Some seem to exist simply to annoy: small, mosquito-like enemies dart at you, avoiding your reticule with every dash. Heavily armored giants spray bullets at you as their armor makes your guns practically worthless. Pudgy foes with jet packs fill the screen with the Immolator, a sort of flamethrower that devastates even formidable opponents.\n\nAnd of course, there are more. More lurking in dark caves. Some that swarm in dozens. Some double, and even triple, the size of the spaceman. The odds are against him since danger almost always lurks at the edge of the screen. Capsized doesn’t work players through waves foes leading up to intense boss battles. Capsized keeps the players engaged in constant, stressful combat. Murderous foes occupy nearly every inch of the sprawling levels. Moving at anything but a careful, measured pace often means death.\n\nCombat makes up a significant part of the experience, but Capsized is equally about exploration. The planet’s gravity isn’t quite the same as Earth, so the spaceman’s got ups. With a grappling hook, he can reach high ledges, and if the next ledge proves just too far away, occasionally the spaceman will find fuel for his jet pack, letting him soar around through pea green and uranium yellow skies. All of these tools must be utilized as the player scours through each area in search of secret passageways and much needed supplies.\n\nAs fun as it may be dangling hundreds of feet above the ground blasting aliens from a tether, Capsized is by no means a flawless adventure. Considering how much time it takes to travel from one part of the map to another, the checkpoint system could have been a little more generous. There are also a number of deadly traps in the game, many of which can’t be seen until the player unwittingly wanders into a hailstorm of undetectable arrows. This just screams of unfairness, especially since you have a limited number of lives at your disposal.\n\nOne thing that two-dimensional games do best is allowing the developers to create distinct and detailed visuals, and Capsized is no exception. The thirteen levels are all excellently drawn and are packed full of detail resulting in really crisp and vibrant environments. Along with some subtle special effects such as night time, sun rays, smoke, and debris, they really suck you into the alien world, which is a great feat considering that there is no third dimension, and the game goes for an artistic, rather than realistic, approach. While the sound effects are solid by all accounts, it was the music and ambient audio that stood out for me, something which a lot of developers forget can have an even larger impact than flashy visuals.\n\nCapsized also has a variety of competitive arcade modes, as well as cooperative gameplay. However, one of the game's biggest disappointments comes from this, since the cooperative play is only local, which seems like a pretty major oversight for PC gaming. I was geared up to play with a friend on the other side of the country, when I realized that the game didn't support it.\n\nAll in all, Capsized is a solid game. If you're nostalgic for the era of DOS-based 2D shooters like Duke Nukem or Commander Keen, there's a good chance you'll enjoy Capsized. With its classic gameplay and a wide variety of ways to get around, Capsized is a good first effort from Alientrap and a good sign of things to come.","March 22","true","19.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

Traps appear in one level out of nowhere and instantly kill you, resetting your progress.  It's a simple timed lock, but due to the horrific character movement you can't reliably get through.\n\nThe graphics are consistent and pleasant, but at times make the game hard to read; you don't know if you're facing an enemy, a terrain outcrop or a usable tool.  An argument can be made that this is part of the theme of discovery that runs through the game, but the gameplay is completely mismatched with such a theme.\n\nIn the end, a game must be judged on its gameplay.

This has been a staple plot line for Science Fiction for almost as long as science fiction itself has existed, there is nothing new with the idea of this setting, or premise; however Capsized manages to take this setting and apply it to an absolutely gorgeous, intense, atmospheric environment paired with equally spine-tingling soundtrack.\n\nThe game is a 2D platformer that combines both fast paced action combat and exploration elements. You control your marooned space cadet across various extraterrestrial environments battling your way through herds of fairly challenging Alien creatures with your main objectives varying from “Rescue X amount of Crew mates” or “Destroy X amount this alien artifact”. The controls of the game feel very refreshing and intuitive and you are packed to the brim with weapons and gadgets to choose from. Two gadgets in particular are what really make the gameplay feel fresh and interesting, the grappling hook and gravity ram; grappling hooks can be used to pull yourself to far away areas or can double as gravity guns similar to that from Half-Life, and Gravity Rams can expel massive bursts of energy to send objects or enemies flying.\n\nThe entire art style for the game is very beautiful, consisting of complex hand-drawn artwork. The game only offers 12 levels, however the art style for each one feels fitting and sets the mood, whether that be a bright colorful level full of alien life, camps, and monuments or whether they be glum and damp and underground with darkness and danger lurking around any corner. The electronic musical soundtrack perfectly accompanies this atmospheric environment, further helping set the mood for each gorgeously illustrated level. Not only is the level design brilliant, but the enemies are also very well done. You won’t get sick and tired of being forced to fight any one enemy over and over, the game does an excellent job of spacing out various enemies of different species, sizes, and difficulty levels.\n\nCapsized manages to provide a very enjoyable action platforming experience with a stunningly beautiful atmospheric environment. The combat feels good and there a large enough variety of both weapons and enemies to keep the game feeling fun and energetic. The only negatives of the game are that there are times when levels tend to feel a bit tedious and become a burden when slight mistakes cause you to have to retry missions multiple times; however this is merely a minor complaint. I would definitely recommend this game especially for such a low budget price of $9.99.

Yes, it is as cluttered as it sounds. The main menu, which consists of white text on a white background (which thankfully scrolls to other colours so you can actually read the text) gives you a good idea of what the rest of the game is going to be like. Eventually, you get used to it, but the developers do not seem to understand that 'good graphics' doesn't just mean nice looking textures. You have to use contrast as well. Draw the players attention to important things, don't hide it in a field of clutter.\n\nThe vsync option in the game also does nothing (at least on the Linux version, anyways), and has no frame limiting. In other words, no matter how slow or how fast your computer is, you will have loads of screen tearing. I switched to windowed mode since I have my window manager (Compiz) set to vsync windowed programs whether they like it or not. I then discovered that the game doesn't try to keep your mouse in the window, so be prepared to accidentally click outside of the game a lot.\n\nMoving on to actual gameplay, the idea of using a grappling "hook" to swing around a low gravity environment and toss enemies around sounds great, but it behaves very strangely mechanically. Shooting a grappling hook horizontally into a wall somehow manages to let you move upwards? I also found the ability to stick to walls was preventing me from moving where I wanted to go instead of helping me.\n\nThe are some other minor issues that could have easily been fixed had more rigorous testing been done. For example, many of your weapons cause splash damage that does very high damage to you if you're too close to where it hits. There are also rapid fire weapons that fire while you hold down the mouse button. When you expend all the ammuniton in one weapon, it automatically switches you to another weapon, firing it if the mouse is currently down. See the problem?\n\nOh, and the game freezes when you try to exit it, so there's that too.","January 30, 2014","false","1.6"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","1"

Capsized is a 2D shooter where you, an astronaut working on a spaceship gets hit, you manage to escape along with some of your friends and crash land on an alien planet. Seperated from your friends you have to rescue them, then escape the alien planet, a pretty straight forward story\n\nThe graphics are very pretty, although a simplistic game where all you have to do is shoot, the graphics and environments made me feel like I am on an alien planet. The music is top notch, very Sci-Fi type music\n\nThe level of difficulty, it is easy at first, but for the last few levels of the game. Capsized takes a high difficulty spike and the game gets really difficult, very frustrating... Capsized is a very short game, clocking in at only 2-3 hours, this game is extremely short.

The controls were not good, especially on a gamepad (for me at least), which made fighting enemies difficult.

Music was good, artwork and environments interesting, and it was fun trying to find some of the secrets, though, again, frustrating trying to control the gravity hook and swing into their hidden entrances.

The gravity manipulation weapon along with the jetpack are so fun. And I liked all the weapons dual fire modes. I think it gets a worse rap than it deserves, especially for a careful player that doesn't just "run" straight into the open thinking he's not going to get effed up. Along with great puzzles for the gravity gun and the ability to wreck pretty much everything in the game without shooting a gun if your insanely up to the challenge, great music and very cool unique art and enemies, I am completely recommending this game.\n\nNow for the things people complain about. First, enemies can see you before you can see them, and for those little flying ♥♥♥♥s it can get really annoying... unless you THINK first and accept it. Bait them and move slower than a rambo shooter. Or grab a ♥♥♥♥ing rock and hold it in front of you, bait them, and then smash them all with it after you move back into a crevice or tunnel. Not rocket science. Repetition on enemies... I'd have to agree... but not to the extent it comes even close to ruining it. I loved having to find the weaknesses of the hardest monsters. And all monsters are pretty much dangerous. Multiplayer has a few flaws but its still a blast.\n\nIn the end, if you rated this game down for any reason, your either a ♥♥♥♥, or you suck at videogames. I have 11.2 hours on record and 100% completion!!! It's NOT THAT HARD. This game is fantastic for the price. And if you don't like the gamepad, newsflash... its a computer game. KbM is a thousand times more accurate than a pad. Step your game up. 8.5 our of 10 for 2.50 on sale... any real gamer would be insane not to buy it.","June 22, 2015","true","11.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

In addition to clinging to walls the grappling ability allows you to manipulate environmental objects such as boulders. You also have a gravity ram ability, which is essentially a powerful headbutt that knocks back enemies and objects.  Still, guns are your primary defense against the alien life forms and most are fun to play with, each offering two unique attacks.\n\nCapsized clocks in at only a few hours and offers Steam achievements, high resolution and several additional modes of play to mess around with once you finish the story.

The art is very nice, whoever designed the worlds and the characters is very talented. The puzzles (at least in the early stages) are exactly what you would expect, and I think any fans of the genre could play this game in their sleep.\nWhere I just couldn't take it anymore was the control. I’m relatively certain it’s by design, since the atmosphere is alien and aquatic in nature, but I never felt in control of the character. Every time I wanted to make even a moderately precise movement, it felt like instead I just floated off into the sunset as if someone simultaneously enabled noclip and turned off friction.\nIt’s pretty and all, but so are most of the more reputable indie platformers. The lack of control I felt while playing, however, instantly put me off from the game and really left me with nothing but negative feelings towards it.","December 3, 2014","false","0.4"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","17","32","2","0"

The game starts and ends with very few worlds. You are a nameless astronaut-soldier-person, who gets the ship that he's on attack by an unknown energy source. It's up to you to save your surviving comrades and battle through hordes of savage aliens.\n\nYeah, it does feel a little cowboys vs natives, but you won't really be thinking about the story since the game usually involes the following:\nShooting things\nPhysics antics.\nShooting things with, I'll admit, a varied weapon set complete with alt-fire. Assault Rifles become shotguns, Flamethrowers become shields, and even a black hole launcher. 9 weapons plus power ups. The enemies are brutal on hard so you need it.\n\nAs for physics antics... the best way to describe the physics was if Newton thought the world played like Asteroids. You have a variety of movement options like this energy hook to pull yourself or objects around, an awesome push mode where you can rocket jump with them and send little critters and objects hurling at your enemies. This also means you'll get some awkward levers and buttons, with the way you can send objects while hooked, it becomes a tad frustrating. Especially when you deal with things that repel bullets so you'd have to launch an object at it, sometimes you accidentally push your ammo over a cliff. But, I digress. Some levels do it well, especially when it's more open, but when they cram you into trap pits and the like you might want to break your keyboard.\n\nThe main negative is definitely the games best selling feature, oddly. Sometimes you propel yourself too fast into enemy fire, or you gain speed walljumping straight into an almost insta-kill poison trap (which has no indication of being there, besides smoke). Or worse, you have to carry objects to a certain area and the object gets stuck. Frustrating.\n\nSo, really, great in an afternoon but it's not perfect. If this sounds good for you, I'd suggest getting it on sale since the most you'll get after the 13 levels is a pretty barebones arcade mode and some modifiers/achievement hunting for the story. These guys really like their physics, and I can't wait to try their other stuff out.","June 4","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is OK and the weapon variety isn't really something out of the ordinary, you also have a jetpack and a grappling hook. The story isn't really that great, where the voice acting is non existing, basicly you're on a ship and you end up on an alien planet and you need to find your way out of there. Now, the good stuff. The game has a STELLAR soundtrack in my opinion and some really great hand drawn graphics and that for me is what made me play the game. It might be just me but I felt that the game was somewhat hard on later levels, other than that, if you enjoy 2D shooters and you enjoy how Capsized looks, I'd say go for it and play it, otherwise it might be a waste of your time.","August 27, 2013","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For those achivements hunters like me, this will compensate the short lenght of the game).\n- No configurable keys or buttons on the joystick.\n- The only joystick recognized by the game is the one from the Xbox 360.\n- Some glitches that prevent to close the game normally (in the linux version, i played the demo on Windows XP at the time without problems).\n- Some achivements are broken (a logical problem in those achivements that ask a requirement for complete in all the levels of the game).\n- Short (can be compensated if you dedicate yourself time to explore the levels for secrets)\n- The use of physics in certain situations can be a headache if not used wisely.\n- Sometimes a mini-map to avoid getting lost would be useful.\n- The developer abandoned this project long ago (no hope for some fixes).\n\nIf you like fast action 2D games, mixed with elements of exploration that are accompanied by beautiful graphics and a good soundtrack, this game is a safe buy.\n\nMy score: 7.5 / 10\n\nNote: Played it on GNU / Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - 32 bits)","September 15, 2014","true","14.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/95300/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Don't make the mistake I did and think that Capsized is some kind of exploration-heavy metroidvania thing. The mentions of exploring and using tools to navigate might suggest that, but it's a very different beast. What you're getting is a floaty sci-fi platformer with a lot of shooting, a lot of physics puzzles, and a lot of frustration. And it might just be short enough to finish before you get fed up with it.\n\nCapsized sees you stranded on an alien world that wastes no time trying to waste you. The natives are restless and the fauna is deadly, and most levels are going to be spent depopulating the area so you can accomplish your goal. Instead of big, sprawling areas, Capsized takes place in fairly compact levels, each one starting you from scratch and tasking you to search high and low for weapons, jetpack fuel, extra lives, and other power-ups. I must emphasize, nothing is carried over between campaign missions, leaving each of the 12 levels feeling a bit thin.\n\nThere's not a lot to do besides kill things, collect power-ups if you're having trouble killing things, and finish the level. Sometimes you need to reach a certain point, sometimes you need to collect doodads, and sometimes you really do just have to kill a bunch of stuff. Navigating the levels to do that might prove difficult, as your spaceman is very floaty and easy to send flying. He can wall jump almost effortlessly, grapple things with a grappling beam, and jetpack around, all with mounting momentum that can easily get unmanageable.\n\nYou'll be shoving and grappling plenty of blocks, too, because Capsized loves physics puzzles. It feels odd calling them physics puzzles, though, because it's usually just a tunnel blocked with junk or a pressure plate that needs to be held down. Finishing said "puzzles" is another source of frustration, since the stones and boxes use the same physics as you and can easily drift away or rocket off the screen. The worst is when you're expected to use a block as a shield against the game's incredibly lethal traps, watching your spaceman get perforated as the block he's holding wobbles around lazily.\n\nDying is very much the low part of the game, and it comes more and more frequently the further in you get. Enemies and especially traps can do tons of damage, and as they become more dense in the later levels it gets that much harder to avoid big chunks of hurt. When you die you either respawn at the last 1-up you collected OR the start of the level, which is infuriating in the more maze-like levels. Several of your best guns also do splash damage to you, and there are plenty of little critters that love to run up and attach to your face to catch mortars for you.\n\nThe art is fantastically detailed, but becomes a bit too busy for a game like this. Sound design is nice and somber but the effects in battle, both audio and visual, are sorely lacking. There's so little impact to weapons you'll never really know how much damage is being done until your enemy (or you) is dead. A few co-op and arcade modes round out the game but the fact is that you're getting a 12-mission campaign that can be beaten in two hours, provided it doesn't make you rage. And whether it be the giant boulder that just will not get out of your way, or the jetpack sniper that runs you out of lives, something will most likely make you jump ship early.","February 3","false","3.1"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","0"

BLOODY SCREEN appears when your character is about to die, and instead of pairing it with regenerating health, the screen stays there until you find a health kit, making navigation a bit of a ♥♥♥♥ing pain. All that, and at two-three hours, the game still feels like it's trying to pad itself out. So it's got that Quake 1 action feel but it's about as interesting as Quake 2.

Because of that, I wouldn't recomend this game, even if it's on sale.","August 20, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Both are unique on their own, but the combination is outright of cosmic proportions in terms of atmosphere. It's weird, but so... attracting. Both features are simply fantastic and game is worth purchase just for those two.\n\nI rarely focus so much on just staring at graphics, but the world is so strange. I could not stop looking at it. It's all blocky and round and has definitely some alien feel to it.\nMusic... It's another dimension and I would start the game just to listen to it. I often turn music down and sometimes turn off completely, but this time the slider went up to the max. Music used for the game was composed by Solar Fields and the album is called Movements. M A S T E R P I E C E of atmosphere. Definitely another dimension and that's why it fits the graphical style.\nBoth are not from this world.\n\nIn terms of gameplay it's an arcade game which focuses on shooting alien creatures, finding and activating things and sometimes collecting items - it is a platformer but with more freedom than just jumping - you get a backpack to help you travel around. You get to use strange futuristic guns - each has own firemode, sounds and effects. Enemies are in form of flying, running/walking nasty creaures that spit, bite, charge and send beams and balls of energy at you. Game has consistent them and won't surprise you. It's just solid and feels oldschool.\n\nThe game features solo campaing which can also be played with another person. There are other modes: deathmatch against the bots, survival, time trial and two more, but... they are locked at start!!! You have to score at least 20 stars in campaing to unlock the bot deathmatch and even more for other modes. WHY WOULD YOU DO IT TO THE PLAYERS? Why such a restriction? The game doesn't feature Cloud Saving, so you have to copy the saves by yourself. That's a huge fail considering the requirement for additional modes.\n\nOptions for graphics, sound and controls(KB+M and joypad) are fine, but the game has limited resolution support (just a few most common), so there it's a small omission here.\n\nGame is good. Atmosphere is outstanding. Mechanics are fine. I liked it.\n","December 21, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Really awesome job as far as 2D side scrollers go. The game had physics that made gameplay interesting. Fun at times and a pain at time also. But regardless it started strong.\n\nI had a bout 4 levels left when I called it quits. The controls never felt right for me. I hate using a mouse and keyboard for a platformer and the gamepad controls felt awkward no matter how I set them up. The gameplay was just a little off and I'm big on controls.. auto-deal-breaker. The levels never really varied either. They all looked pretty much the same as the last. I never got excited to see the next level. When me and my som tried local co-op it was just a mess. With our grappling beams constantly pulling the same rocks, debri, etc. it felt more like a chore than a fun co-op experience.\n\nSo although this game started out strong, if I had it to do again..

The control of the character is difficult most of the time and it can become frustrating sometimes. Also the aiming has the same issue. I always have the feeling that the character is very....."slippery".

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #31: Capsized\n\nCapsized is an action platformer.  I didn't realize until right before I started that this is from the same developers who made Apotheon, which I was a big fan on.  Certainly though, this is a much different game.\n\nThe campaign begins as your ship has crashed on an alien planet, and is broken up into a series of levels, during which you are trying to save your crewmates and escape.\n\nFirst thing I have to say is the art is gorgeous.  The backgrounds are very detailed, and definitely gives you the feeling of being on an alien planet.  You definitely are not left with the sense that the developers cut any corners here.  Unfortunately it seems the presentation has a price as I found it stuttered at times on my mid-range system.  I'm not used to that with 2D platformers.  It wasn't enough to detract from the experience overall, but it was a mild annoyance at times.\n\nThe soundtrack also does a good job standing out.  The music is moody and does a good job evoking the feeling of exploring an alien world.\n\nOn the down side, I found the controls a bit difficult at times.  You use the right stick to aim and the left stick to move and jump.  It takes some getting used to, but it's manageable.  You can also play with the keyboard and mouse, but I didn't try it myself.\n\nThe game is filled with combat and weapons, but also provides a secondary firing mode with a gravity gun.  This is used to good effect by the game by adding in some physics based puzzles to go along with the exploration and combat.  The early levels are not that difficult, but I could definitely sense an increase in the difficulty with each level.\n\nAs you progress though the campaign, you will earn a number of stars for each level, depending on factors such as how quickly you progress, how many times you die, and how many secrets you find.  As you earn stars, it will unlock other arcade game modes.  I only unlocked one of these modes in the hour I played, which was a basic deathmatch mode against a bot that wasn't terribly smart.\n\nOverall I thought this was a pretty decent game, but I like Apotheon better.  If you are a big fan of platformers though, this is worth checking out.","August 8, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nevermind the fact that you can jetpack around lasso-ing objects and enemies alike to navigate- the world itself is the star. The environment is beautiful, full of detailed organic life and creatures and I don't even know what, and an equally awesome soundtrack echoes throughout giving this game an A+ for atmosphere in my book.\n\nI played the game on Hard and it was a fun difficult challenge, when I encountered a few specific types of enemies.

Capsized has a very robust physics engine and an interesting assortment of weapons to choose from. However, there's not so much enemy variety and the main campaing is relatively easy to complete, e.g. 3-4 hours or 15-20 minutes per level (of which there are 12). Some of the levels require minimal "puzzle" solving, like pushing a lever to open a gate or throwing a rock at something etc; most levels need you to get to other side of the map, kill some meanies or collect some items from around the map. I believe the game could be much bettter if it had a little "extra", like RPG or rogue-like or exploration elements.\n\nI got this one for free when I pre-ordered Apotheon via Humble-Bundle. I guess I wouldn't pay full-price for Capsized, but I can surely recommend it for those who like fast-paced shooter-platformers, without too much of a challenge.","January 19, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

To make things worse, the hit boxes are awful.  So not only can you not aim at the space bug that wants to kill you, even if you do shoot it through the face, it won't register as a hit.\n\nEvery derivative game has to have a mechanic that makes it SPECIAL.  In the case of Capsized, it's the gravity gun.  This of course means physics puzzles.  Joy.  Physics puzzles haven't been completely overdone over the past ten years or anything.  Remember that with the horrible controls, the giant concrete slab that you have to place precisely or else die will simply not go where you want it to.  Puzzles are annoying when you don't have to repeat them a dozen times due to lousy controls.  If you make me repeat a puzzle through no fault of my own, I will hate you.\n\nAt the very least the graphics seem pretty.","December 30, 2013","false","0.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Movement is very free. You have a grapple and can stick to walls, in addition to being able to pick up jetpack fuel. You can also use the grapple to grab and throw items. The graphics are marionette-ish, which I really don't care for, but the gameplay is fun.\n\nWorks with a gamepad, but for some idiot reason you have to go into the options menu and enable gamepad support first. The gamepad play is actually the best I've seen in a free-aiming game. You use the sticks and the trigger/bumper buttons instead of what most games do, where you're trying to figure out how the hell to use the abxy buttons while using the right-stick at the same time. There's several different things you can do, and the gravity is very low, so you're quite 'floaty'. Because of this it takes a few minutes to get used to the controls, but after that it's entirely workable.","February 20, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I love 2-D Metroid, even though I've never actually finished any of the games. I have started them, though. Oh boy, have I started them. I started Super Metroid on the SNES, and got about 40% done. Then the battery in the cart died. R.I.Panasonic CR2032 battery.\n\nLater, I started the game up again with a little assistance from the ZSNES PC emulator. Got around 80%, then reformatted my computer. R.I.Partitions.\n\nMy third soiree with Super Metroid took place on the Wii in the form of a Virtual Console download, which went great until the Wii lived at a house that I did not. R.I.Parent's basement.\n\nI also played though most of Metroid Fusion, but that doesn't have a story behind it. I just lost the cartridge. I managed through the original Metroid on the Gamecube, courtesy of a unlockable Metroid Prime/GBA connection bonus, and lived to tell the tale of using that dammed postage stamp-sized d-pad. I plan on recounting this story to my grandchildren, and hopefully it will serve as explanation why I cannot play catch, write, or handle cutlery properly thanks to my deformed, claw-like left hand, forever frozen in the twisted position that using that minuscule d-pad necessitated.\n\nI pray they'll understand.\n\nI suppose I'm telling you this because I have a bit of a predisposition towards pretty 2-D games that feature people in spacesuits alone on alien worlds, which is what Metroid and Capsized share in common. It can be easy to assume that they'd share more, like a focus on exploration, creepy atmosphere, and progressive unlockables, but that's not the case despite what you might have assumed from the screenshots. And the Steam Store description. Instead, Capsized is, according to the (partially accurate) store page description, 'fast paced' and 'intense,' neither of which really gelled with me since the controls (and the physics) feel pretty loose.\n\nThe graphics are nice, and the physics are fun to wrestle with once you get a feel for them, but at the end of the day, I simply didn't find the game very interesting. Also, this game is somehow rather taxing on my quad-core, 8gb RAM equipped laptop. I had resigned myself to 720p for games like Bioshock Infinite and Borderlands 2, but this game as well? Meh.\n\nIn the end, my review is an opinion. That's what reviews are. And my opinion is that I didn't really like this game. Brought forth a sense of apathy from me. Sorry, I guess. The developers were gracious enough to put up a demo on their store page, so in the end that's going to be the best determinant for you, really.\n\nThere is, however, one thing that really did honestly bother me about Capsized. In the game, you are on an alien planet. There's alien creatures, sure, but also a lot of alien humanoids that look an awful lot like a western stereotype of 'jungle natives.' I mean, they shoot darts. Throw spears. Wear tall wooden masks. Sacrifice your little astronaut friends on stone tables. Tiki torches. Magical shamen. Idols. Speak a gutteral language that could be transcribed as “Ooga-booga.”\n\nYour missions generally revolve around killing all of them. And destroying their idols. Yes, there's an achievement for finishing 5 levels without firing a shot, but it's an achievement. It's supposed to be hard. Normal play looks a lot like you, a pale man in a spacesuit, committing xenocide (another achievement, natch) with your laser pistol, laser RPG, laser shotgun, laser flamethrower and wiping out all traces of these “primitive's” religion. Hell, I honestly wouldn't care if these alien natives looked alien, but with how much of the art draws from imagination, and then you're faced with a pretty familiar depiction of earthly native jungle people just rubs me the wrong way, especially since the game really doesn't seem to be concerned about it at all.\n\nMaybe I'm just on edge a bit after playing through Uncharted 2 again and (SPOILERS DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT OR GO AHEAD I'M NOT YOUR MOM) being reminded that the hero single-handedly wipes out an ancient city populated by magical natives (that you are expected to mow down with a variety of advanced military-grade weaponry) and the story narrative shrugs this off. Literally, the hero shrugs after bringing the whole city down. Happy ending. No one cares.\n\nIt may seem like a little, arbitrary thing and...maybe it is, but the first thing that comes to my mind after Capsized isn't the gameplay, nor the story, nor even the art, it's the dissonance between the foreignness of an alien world that the developers want me to be absorbed in, and the very familiar feeling of the aliens depicted in the game. That's what sticks with me, and helps me decide to not recommend this game, Steam. I appreciate you listening.","March 22","false","1.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I finally made myself finish the game.  Here's the thing with Capsized -\n\nThe aesthetic is AMAZING.  Few 2D games look this freaking amazing.\n\nThe music is spot on, and Solar Fields not only capture the atmosphere, but add to it tremendously with one of the most chillaxed and haunting videogame OST's ever.\n\nThe movement is appropriately floating, given the alien landscape, and this is both a good and a bad thing.  It's bad, because it feels so unnatural and unintuitive, in a way, and this usually is a blemish on any other game, but because of the setting of Capsized, I find it acceptable, and actually necessary to sell the fact that I'm on this strange and scary world.\n\nCombat is okay ... feels very much like a twin-stick-shooter, despite being 2D, side-scrolling, open-level platformer.  I think there were too many weapon options.  Honestly, I think about 4 of the weapons were nessesary, and the rest were filler that the devs probably thought were cool.  Maybe they were, but I stuck with what worked, and didn't spend a lot of time with many of the weapons.\n\nThe story is okay ... a little bland, but I'm not here for the narrative, so I don't really care ... I like bland stories in games.\n\nOverall I recommend Capsized to anyone who likes playing twin-stick shooters with their keyboard and mouse, who are willing to spend some times on an alien planet, fighting lurking wildlife and natives.\n\nOh, and I guess there are "secrets" in this game, but I certainly didn't care one whit about finding any of them.

Unfortunately it has some major control issues that make the game a chore to play. First, there is always some input lag (even on powerful machines) that make the shooting frustrating rather than fun. You also slide around a LOT on the terrain like everything is coated with ice and the lack of precision on the controls means you're never really fully in control of your character. For a platformer, this makes the game frustrating and kills the fun. Thankfully I got this as part of an indie bundle instead of paying full price, as I can't really recommend this game.","December 21, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At its core it has interesting game mechanics with the gravity hook and gravity ram.  With the hook you can swing around across platforms like Tarzan while firing at enemies, solve small puzzles by bringing weights to deactivate traps, and even grab enemies if you dare.  The ram at first appears to be only useful for blasting objects away, but you'll quickly realize that it's actually an effective way of launching yourself into the air as well as skipping rapidly across terrains.  The combination of these two creates an interesting fast paced way to move yourself through the levels.  The gunplay is also fairly satisfying and has the standard automatic weapons and explosive weapons as well as some more interesting ones such as a Quasar Array that creates a miniature blackhole.\n\nThe level design is where it suffers a bit.  The more obvious complaint about the design is that it is possible to get into a situation where completing the level is impossible.  For example, at one point when taking an elevator down to a lower part of the stage, a certain amount of weight needs to be on the elevator before it will move down, much like the force needed to compress a spring.  So weights in the form of huge boulders have to be added onto it and combined with the character's weight, the elevator will move down, but if you're unfortunate enough such that one of the rocks roll off the elevator once it hits the bottom, the elevator will begin to move back up.  Then you're stuck because you have no more weights and can't get back down, or other weights are far enough from your position that going back to retrieve them will most likely get your player killed because you'll have to go through traps.  If you're collecting the secrets this becomes doubly painful.  Although this is the most serious case of the problem, similar issues crop up at different stages of the game that involves weights deactivating traps.\n\nAnother issue that I found annoying was the range of the enemies.  Once the character has been detected by enemies, not only are they able to keep track of you through solid walls and floor, they can shoot at you from off the screen and there isn't a peeking feature that allows you to see farther from your regular view.  It's hard to accurately return fire yet they have a decent chance at hitting you.  These aren't game breaking but can be fairly frustrating at times.\n\nThe last minor one is that powerups are frequenly found to be unuseful because to get to them involves wiping out enemies in the nearby vicinity, and since they're activated once picked up they aren't nearly used to their full effect.  No need for an energy shield if the nearest enemy is far enough that the time it'll take to get there is longer than the duration of the powerup.\n\nEven with these problems, this is a worthwhile game to check out.  There are twelve levels and the difficulty rapidly ramps up after a certain point so it'll probably appeal more to those who enjoy difficult platformer shooters or if interested in a co-op experience.  I feel like if the developers took another look at the game and made some adjustments for a sequel, a very solid game can come out of it.","November 30, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Swing from the ceiling, yank stuff around, repulse matter directly away from you, and even use enemies as projectiles (or meatshields) against their friends.

Not that it takes much to be worthy of that accolade, but hey, it's still something. Let's get started.\n\nI - Story [5/10]\n\nCapsized is a sci-fi, indie platformer from Alientrap Games Inc. that puts the player smack in the middle of a (predominantly) hostile alien planet. Your goal: find your crew mates and get off the planet alive. It's an old theme, but that doesn't mean it can't still give us a few kicks.\n\nII - UI [8/10]\n\nThe user interface was simple and got the job done. I never felt confused as to what needed doing or where I was headed. Weapon and item pick-ups could have used better labeling (in my opinion), but it wasn't anything to cry over. All in all, the UI was well put together and was user-friendly.\n\nIII - Gameplay [7/10]\n\nI am a big fan of platformer games, but the control over character movement in Capsized has a special place in my heart forevermore. The physics were simply marvelous and the player's earned mastery over them (compliments of jet pack and Gravity Hook) make exploring their alien surroundings utterly enjoyable. Not only did this allow for great vantage points from which to dispatch enemies, but it also allowed for new dodging options when faced with enemy attacks.\n\nThe enemies, however, tend to be fairly frustrating at times. I found myself often faced with enemies who were not necessarily "difficult" in any sense of the word, but became increasingly obnoxious over time. That being said, it only detracts a little from the atmosphere of Capsized as a whole.\n\nMy only other real complaint was that my remaining ammunition in various weapons (and fuel for my jet pack) did not carry over with me to the next level.\n\nIV - Content [8/10]\n\nBeing an indie game I didn't go into Capsized expecting it to have a terribly large amount of content and it didn't (per say). The content it does have though is very unique and serves to make the game feel that much bigger. There were plenty of different enemies to slay with a modestly wide variety of weapons. That, in and of itself, is more than most games have going for them in the first place.\n\nV - Visual [10/10]\n\nThe graphics in Capsized are all hand-drawn and they are spectacular. Every visual aspect of the game seems very unique and makes it a pleasure to trek through such a hostile planet. From the exotic landscapes to the ferocious, indigenous population, this is an unforgettable journey in terms of aesthetics.\n\nVI - Audio [8/10]\n\nThe music and sounds of Capsized are great and they add a lot to the game. Even at lower settings though, I sometimes felt that the music drowned out the sound effects of the game and interfered with the ambiance of it all.\n\nVII - Overall [7.7/10]\n\nCapszied is a genuinely fun platformer and, though at times it can be frustrating in terms of combat, it all works out and is a solid piece of work.","January 12, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought if this is something similar then I'm in for a great ride... but not quite I'm afraid.\n\nCapsized is an absolutely gorgeous looking shooter/platformer with deeply flawed gameplay. The character movement is very floaty and not precise at all, I could have accepted that mechanic as in many other games if you didn't constantly get stuck on the environment (Even when walking on THE ****in FLOORS!?!) and had to jump to get around most of the time.\n\nThe hand-drawn environments are painstakingly detailed which makes the game look great in stills but once you actually start controlling the game and shooting, you're very likely to loose your enemies as they blend into the backgrounds more often than not. The music is great sounding but does not fit the atmosphere at all.\n\nThe weapons are standard stuff you'd find in a shooter in this ilk (they also have secondary fire which are also pretty standard) but what mostly killed the game for me was the gravity tether: an energy rope you can use to pick stuff up and throw them which can, and probably should, also be used for environment traversal. This device heavily relies on physics in order to get the result you wish for it but 90% of the time it just doesn't work how you want it to and will probably even result in your untimely death. Sometimes you are required to use the tether to get to lower/higher places and this sometimes had me trying for dozens of minutes just struggling to get a rock out of my way so I could go on with the rest of the mission.\n\nEnemies are fast, ferocious, bullet sponges and highly accurate with their shots. Some can even fly and follow you wherever you go. They'll nail you from across the screen with their shots before you even get to realize where they are. This is of course on the easy and normal difficulty where a LOT of trial and error as well as memorization of enemy placement can help you get through the levels because the hard difficulty will kill you with single hits and smaller enemies can grind you to dust in no time at all.\n\nThis game is NOT about fair challenge. I was constantly fighting the mechanics to get the most trivial things done (even getting from point A to B can become a frustrating challenge). The graphics are amazing to look at and the music is fine but even they lead to frustration and gameplay problems. You can use a gamepad but that will complicate the moving/aiming even more. It's just better to play with keyboard/mouse. I honestly wanted SO MUCH to like this game but it's just a mess to play through.\n\nThere is coop and there are some secret areas in every level which don't mean anything as they are more of the normal power-ups you get. There are some arcade modes like survival and bot matches and 2-player vs. and I can see the appeal in some of the modes but this is pretty normal, run-of-the-mill stuff we've seen before. Another thing, the achievements are some of the most uninspired I've seen in a while. They could have at least made stuff interesting here with the different weapons and mechanics but nope.\n\nUnbalanced and simply a chore to get through. Can't recommend this unless you know what you're getting into and even then, I still wouldn't. Play the demo first.","March 5, 2015","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story was told through pictures in scenes before and after every level meaning that many players will interpret the story differently. The music was great and there where various enemies making it a great experience, barely ever repeting desighn or level. This game was amazing and one of the greatest indie games i have ever played (not realy a large advertised game but a smallish game) sometimes indies can truely be better than big launch titles, this game is a perfect example of one. Just a tip if: if you find any levels realy hard (such as 11) take it slow and dont rush, if you do you will probably get killed in a lange hored of enemies, if any level is extremely hard you should probably change your difficulty down if you are new to the game. Another probably more important thing is to take your time to explore as you will find many useful secrets and amazing hidden things in the beutiful levels. I beleive this game is amazing and worth your money! just one question, is the game hand drawn like rayman origins? becaus the environments and creatures look amazing like they have had a lot of time put into them.","December 23, 2013","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure the jetpack & hook take some practise to fully master for tricks & fast moves, but isnt that the same with any game? I found I could use the jetpack & hook to really spring around quickly & easily after 2 or 3 levels, It became a really good tactic for combat.\nThe games a bit of a thrust/jetman/exile hybrid, the visuals are very good, the sound & music of top quality also.\nThe game is moderately challenging on hard & im glad to say not to the point where I found it frustrating. Theres a nice variation of weapons & they feel powerfull. Theres also a small number of power ups & its worth exploring the maps to find the secrets & said power ups especially on later levels. It plays well & looks top drawer on high settings with no frame rate issues for me at all.\nIf you fancy a game to kill 4 or 5 hours this comes recommended.\n\n\n\n","March 17, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure the jetpack & hook take some practise to fully master for tricks & fast moves, but isnt that the same with any game? I found I could use the jetpack & hook to really spring around quickly & easily after 2 or 3 levels, It became a really good tactic for combat.\nThe games a bit of a thrust/jetman/exile hybrid, the visuals are very good, the sound & music of top quality also.\nThe game is moderately challenging on hard & im glad to say not to the point where I found it frustrating. Theres a nice variation of weapons & they feel powerfull. Theres also a small number of power ups & its worth exploring the maps to find the secrets & said power ups especially on later levels.

Akin to Metroidvania style games, Capsized has you scouring levels for pickups, upgrades, and stuff to fling at enemies. The gravity hook works well most of the time, and gives you more than one way to kill enemies. The AI for the enemies is somewhat mediocre, with enemies getting themselves stuch behind walls, etc. This is probably made up for by how damaging some of the enemies can be, you will find yourself cursing your death more than a few times. All in all, Capsized is probably best to pick up in one of the many bundles going around these days, or at the very least, during a sale.","February 14, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story was told through pictures in scenes before and after every level meaning that many players will interpret the story differently. The music was great and there where various enemies making it a great experience, barely ever repeting desighn or level. This game was amazing and one of the greatest indie games i have ever played (not realy a large advertised game but a smallish game) sometimes indies can truely be better than big launch titles, this game is a perfect example of one. Just a tip if: if you find any levels realy hard (such as 11) take it slow and dont rush, if you do you will probably get killed in a lange hored of enemies, if any level is extremely hard you should probably change your difficulty down if you are new to the game. Another probably more important thing is to take your time to explore as you will find many useful secrets and amazing hidden things in the beutiful levels. I beleive this game is amazing and worth your money! just one question, is the game hand drawn like rayman origins? becaus the environments and creatures look amazing like they have had a lot of time put into them.","December 23, 2013","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not that it takes much to be worthy of that accolade, but hey, it's still something. Let's get started.\n\nI - Story [5/10]\n\nCapsized is a sci-fi, indie platformer from Alientrap Games Inc. that puts the player smack in the middle of a (predominantly) hostile alien planet. Your goal: find your crew mates and get off the planet alive. It's an old theme, but that doesn't mean it can't still give us a few kicks.\n\nII - UI [8/10]\n\nThe user interface was simple and got the job done. I never felt confused as to what needed doing or where I was headed. Weapon and item pick-ups could have used better labeling (in my opinion), but it wasn't anything to cry over. All in all, the UI was well put together and was user-friendly.\n\nIII - Gameplay [7/10]\n\nI am a big fan of platformer games, but the control over character movement in Capsized has a special place in my heart forevermore. The physics were simply marvelous and the player's earned mastery over them (compliments of jet pack and Gravity Hook) make exploring their alien surroundings utterly enjoyable. Not only did this allow for great vantage points from which to dispatch enemies, but it also allowed for new dodging options when faced with enemy attacks.\n\nThe enemies, however, tend to be fairly frustrating at times. I found myself often faced with enemies who were not necessarily "difficult" in any sense of the word, but became increasingly obnoxious over time. That being said, it only detracts a little from the atmosphere of Capsized as a whole.\n\nMy only other real complaint was that my remaining ammunition in various weapons (and fuel for my jet pack) did not carry over with me to the next level.\n\nIV - Content [8/10]\n\nBeing an indie game I didn't go into Capsized expecting it to have a terribly large amount of content and it didn't (per say). The content it does have though is very unique and serves to make the game feel that much bigger. There were plenty of different enemies to slay with a modestly wide variety of weapons. That, in and of itself, is more than most games have going for them in the first place.\n\nV - Visual [10/10]\n\nThe graphics in Capsized are all hand-drawn and they are spectacular. Every visual aspect of the game seems very unique and makes it a pleasure to trek through such a hostile planet. From the exotic landscapes to the ferocious, indigenous population, this is an unforgettable journey in terms of aesthetics.\n\nVI - Audio [8/10]\n\nThe music and sounds of Capsized are great and they add a lot to the game. Even at lower settings though, I sometimes felt that the music drowned out the sound effects of the game and interfered with the ambiance of it all.\n\nVII - Overall [7.7/10]\n\nCapszied is a genuinely fun platformer and, though at times it can be frustrating in terms of combat, it all works out and is a solid piece of work.","January 12, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story, although simple, is enough to keep one playing through the game and more enemies are added to in keep things interesting. My only gripe about the game like many other reviews is the difficulty curve gets incredibly difficult half way through the game. Going from losing no lives in the first couple of maps to losing over half of my lives on a single map can be quite frustrating. What more, I feel that some of the puzzle traps do not translate well to the controls of the game, forcing the player to merely minimize damage as they run through certain areas of the game. Despite all the issues I would definitely recommend picking the game up in a bundle or while on sale. I beat the game in a couple of hours, so keep that in mind when purchasing.\n\n7.5/10.0\n","May 2, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seemed like the game I was looking for to satisfy my need for a retro, side-scroller/platformer with more modern design choices--and in a lot of ways, it is. I like the array of weaponry, and I mostly enjoy the way movement works; when you get a feel for it, it's like bungee jumping across the terrain like a sci-fi Spiderman. Completing objectives in the campaign feels satisfying. But there are elements of this game that fall short in some important ways.\n\nSome of them are incredibly basic; the worst offenders were the incredibly slidey and imprecise movement, which detracted from what made the rest of that system interesting, and the lack of responsive gun-swapping control (via the MMB). Firing your weapon upon clicking to unpause is also incredibly sloppy and occasionally wasteful of uncommon ammo. I would also say that it was an oversight to neglect to put all the information relevant to achievements for each level on the campaign map.\n\nLarger but rarer issues also impacted the experience negatively. Although I appreciate the desire to throw new things at players and let them figure it out, there are some curve balls that would have benefitted from some kind of preparation or clearer cues. There was an enemy type (priests) that really came out of nowhere and seemed to just eat everything I shot at it, to the point where I considered that it was invulnerable except to some specific ammo. Any sort of consistent audio or visual clue that it was taking damage would have been helpful, but it rarely did either.\n\nBasically, this game is frustrating at many times in plenty of little ways, yet fun. I'd recommend it, with some caveats.","June 20, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first glance it looks like a familiar side-scrolling, run-n-gun platformer, but is set apart by its detailed visual-style and variety of gameplay mechanics.\n\n\nThe campaign's story is very bare-bones and basic, as is the comic book style by which it is conveyed. A series of beautifully drawn images, sans any dialogue, are shown panel-by-panel telling how a spaceship of Human astronauts is hit by an unidentified object, so they are forced to suit-up and evacuate via the ships escape pods.\n\nBrief, 1 to 3-panel story strips also serve as introductions to each of the stages and your objective in them. The introductory strip for the first stage shows one of the pods crash-landing (upside down, I suppose where the name “Capsized” came from) onto the jungle-like surface of an unknown alien planet. You play as the spaceman that steps out of it and you proceed to follow your first vague objective: explore the alien planet.\n\n\nCapsized's gameplay is mix of exploration, puzzle-solving and shooting action, using WASD to move and the mouse to aim your targeting reticle. Objectives are usually simple; reach the end of the area, destroy certain targets, collect items etc., though completing them often requires more thought as puzzles are introduced and the enemies get progressively heftier,  more wily and numerous.\n\nThe stranded astronaut can use a nice variety of futuristic weapons to blast away alien scum who are selfishly trying to protect their home world. Though you start each stage with just the puny blast carbine, there are plenty more to choose from should you discover them within the stages. From basic pulsar rifles and flamethrowers to advanced homing nano-bot launchers and the devastating “Quasar Array”, there's a suitable weapon for every situation.\n\n\nAside from the weapons, you can also jump and stomp “plumber style” on weaker enemies with your hefty space-boots, or use the handy grappling beam to grab rocks (or, indeed, small creatures) to launch at your foes. The grappling beam also serves as alternative means of traversing the environments; you can use it to pull yourself towards surfaces or swing throughout the planet like Tarzan in an spacesuit.\n\nYou also have a handy jetpack, activated with the spacebar, useful for boosting around the more open areas, provided you discover fuel for it. Jetpack fuel, as well as ammunition, extra lives and various powerups, are hidden throughout the stages. To reach them you need to find secret passages through the walls, basically by bumping against the edges of the map until you fall through it. It is usually worth scouring the terrain for these goodies to gain the edge, particularly in the latter half of the game where I found the difficulty seemed to spike considerably.\n\nPhysics play a big part in the game's mechanics; using the grapple beam is essential to pull levers, or lift rocks to drop them onto pressure pads and to open doors and access new sections of the maps, or to simply knock away debris that is blocking your path. There are situations where you will need to haul items across the stage to dump it onto a pressure pad on the other side (made somewhat easier by the low gravity), either dodging enemies or clearing them from the path in advance, the latter being my preferred method as some will actively hunt you when the see you.\n\nMoving objects around can be problematic and was a major cause of frustration, particularly in enclosed spaces as they will get stuck in the terrain occasionally. Also in areas where you must carry rocks to pressure pads, I often found myself reaching them only to accidentally launch the rock off a cliff edge and groaning as it tumbled back down to the surface.\n\n\nThe music of Capsized consists of some nice atmospheric synth-tunes, though overall it lacks variety. The tracks are also usually rather slow-paced and, well, relaxing which I thought doesn't really fit an action game. Each stage has a different theme, but you will often hear the same tracks repeated in the background. This doesn't really detract from the experience too much, but I felt a lot more could have been done with the music, even if it is nice to listen to.\n\nAs for sound effects, there are plenty of background noises such as sounds of unseen wildlife tweeting or making insect-like clicking sounds, giving a nice feel of a living world. You've also got the basic laser weapon “zaps”, alien creatures' screeches and grunts and explosions and whatnot, all of which mesh together nicely.\n\n\nOne stand-out aspect of Capsized is the gorgeous, hand-drawn art style through which the vibrant alien world is visualised. While the environments are limited to the similar-looking overworld regions or caves beneath the surface, the amount of detail is impressive. Vines sway, docile indigenous creatures can be seen wandering about in the background, also weather effects such as sunshafts cascade over open areas in daytime stages, while mist and rain add to the visual ambience of night stages.\n\n\nI managed the main campaign in around 6 hours, a decent length for an Indie such as this considering there's a good amount of content included to keep up the longevity.\n\nThere is a local co-op mode; you can team up with someone via two Xbox 360 pads to take on the campaign together, although I lacked the equipment to try it out. In arcade mode, there are other game types to play such as survival which pits you against waves of enemies, time trial where you must traverse stages in search for oxygen capsules to stay alive. You can also duel against another player, though only locally using two game pads as there's no online option sadly.\n\nOverall, Capsized is a good game and although it is frustrating in parts and not particularly deep, it has enough variety and challenge to keep it fun and interesting during the 5-6 hour campaign.","May 30, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought if this is something similar then I'm in for a great ride... but not quite I'm afraid.\n\nCapsized is an absolutely gorgeous looking shooter/platformer with deeply flawed gameplay. The character movement is very floaty and not precise at all, I could have accepted that mechanic as in many other games if you didn't constantly get stuck on the environment (Even when walking on THE ****in FLOORS!?!) and had to jump to get around most of the time.\n\nThe hand-drawn environments are painstakingly detailed which makes the game look great in stills but once you actually start controlling the game and shooting, you're very likely to loose your enemies as they blend into the backgrounds more often than not. The music is great sounding but does not fit the atmosphere at all.\n\nThe weapons are standard stuff you'd find in a shooter in this ilk (they also have secondary fire which are also pretty standard) but what mostly killed the game for me was the gravity tether: an energy rope you can use to pick stuff up and throw them which can, and probably should, also be used for environment traversal. This device heavily relies on physics in order to get the result you wish for it but 90% of the time it just doesn't work how you want it to and will probably even result in your untimely death. Sometimes you are required to use the tether to get to lower/higher places and this sometimes had me trying for dozens of minutes just struggling to get a rock out of my way so I could go on with the rest of the mission.\n\nEnemies are fast, ferocious, bullet sponges and highly accurate with their shots. Some can even fly and follow you wherever you go. They'll nail you from across the screen with their shots before you even get to realize where they are. This is of course on the easy and normal difficulty where a LOT of trial and error as well as memorization of enemy placement can help you get through the levels because the hard difficulty will kill you with single hits and smaller enemies can grind you to dust in no time at all.\n\nThis game is NOT about fair challenge. I was constantly fighting the mechanics to get the most trivial things done (even getting from point A to B can become a frustrating challenge). The graphics are amazing to look at and the music is fine but even they lead to frustration and gameplay problems. You can use a gamepad but that will complicate the moving/aiming even more. It's just better to play with keyboard/mouse. I honestly wanted SO MUCH to like this game but it's just a mess to play through.\n\nThere is coop and there are some secret areas in every level which don't mean anything as they are more of the normal power-ups you get. There are some arcade modes like survival and bot matches and 2-player vs. and I can see the appeal in some of the modes but this is pretty normal, run-of-the-mill stuff we've seen before. Another thing, the achievements are some of the most uninspired I've seen in a while. They could have at least made stuff interesting here with the different weapons and mechanics but nope.\n\nUnbalanced and simply a chore to get through. Can't recommend this unless you know what you're getting into and even then, I still wouldn't. Play the demo first.","March 5, 2015","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a jetpack, but limited fuel, which makes scaling heights a constant pain.\n- Difficulty curve is way off and just plain messy. First five levels are easy, then the sixth is 10x harder. Then easy-ish again. And then the difficulty spikes on the second-last level once again.\n- Level design is problematic. Too large, have too many enemies clumped together and often too many objectives to complete.\n- Enemies almost always see you before you see them, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n- Certain enemies are just too overpowered to be enjoyable to fight, especially when it's hard to manoeuvre. Should've been saved for the end-game boss.\n\nOn paper, the pros of this game look like they'd outweigh the cons, but in reality, the game is just a frustrating experience. I completed the game (though I used the easiest difficulty on a few levels) and it certainly would be possible to 100%, but the level design just makes it laborious and un-fun. Which is a shame, because this game could've been much more.\n\nI really think that just having constant anti-gravity (or jetpack fuel that regenerates without a powerup) would've made the game a lot more enjoyable. The final boss level has anti-gravity the whole time, and although it's a relatively hard level, it was a much less painlful experience than 90% of those that came before it.","August 5, 2015","false","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is simple in principle, but becomes loads of fun when you start getting the hang of it. You actually work your way to survival by utilizing physics and insane space technology, while battling it out against hordes of nasty alien creatures that want you off their planet - you and your fellow marooned space men. The controls are easy and very precise, while the graphics are gorgeous 2d art. The music is some kind of techno trance that works quite well here. There are several game modes besides the campain too, including bot matches, survival and multiplayer for extra value. And it also comes with steam achievements and a low price...Granted the campaign might be somewhat short and the general idea won't allow tons of gameplay depth, but it is a game that succeeds to offer what it is supposed to : a great platformer and a quick time waster fix.\n\nVerdict : Great actually! 8/10","June 25, 2011","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Traps do way too much damage and are sometimes unavoidable for stupid reasons.\n\nLevel design is generic and everything is washed with a shade of green,  Story is barebones and hasn't done anything interesting.

You are forced to shoot through them all to accomplish a variety of objectives, such as saving crew members, getting ship parts, and slaying certain types of alien tribal people.\n-Most of the missions boil down to either search and destroy or dragging something to a desired location. It doesn't get much more complicated than that.\n-Capsized doesn't really do anything differently than any other game. There are a few cool guns, some interesting environments, and various upgrades, but it doesn't really get any deeper.\n-The foreground is distracting. Later on the amount of enemies on screen gets fairly insane, and the backgrounds become an eyesore. Though it seems like a lot of work was put into these environments, they are almost TOO complex. I only played for about an hour and had to quit due to a headache.\n-Even on easy mode this game is fairly hard. You will die a lot, and sometimes you will have to restart due to an error. A couple of times I had a physics based error that made it impossible to progress. I didn't particularly enjoy any level enough to replay it again, so this quickly became a pain.\n-I like the music, but it starts to drone on repetitively after a time.\n-It's a cheap game, might be worth the ten bucks, but I can't see this appealing to everyone.\n-It certainly didn't appeal to me.\n-I may give it a try another day, but Capsized seemed far more frustrating than it was worth. Wonky physics, annoying amounts of enemies, and the lack of anything really that captivating prevented me from enjoying my run.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n-Not really worth the time. This may appeal to people who enjoy sidescrolling shooters, but the controls weren't tight enough for me to enjoy the experience. I like the idea of a minimalistic story told through pictures rather than words, but in the end I never felt like what they were portraying really translated into the gameplay. I can see this being a good distraction for a few hours, but nothing more than that. Despite the almost soothing music and charming art style, Capsized it's a very frantic game that offers a very familiar story that might not be worth the time to relive.","January 20","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The movement mechanics are a bit too complex for their own good at times, but exploring the world and fighting aliens is fun all the way through the campaign. The story is simple but effective, and the alien world you explore is pretty damn creative.","April 8","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Beautiful artwork with loads of detail, and great soundtrack that almost reminds me of Nervous Testpilot( Frozen Synapse). In the end I felt the game could have been a little longer, but I'm not complaining-there's still stuff to do, and a coop whIch I've not yet tried. If anyone else has bought humble bundle 8, download this game and start playing already!","July 27, 2013","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game proves how important sound and music is to games. It's a solid run and gun platformer but the sonic aspects turn that into a truly engaging and immersive experience.\n\n2. The soundtrack is by a one man project called Solar Fields from an album called Movements. Buy it!\n\n3. People are saying this game has puzzle elements. That's dumb. The puzzles are on the level of "There's rocks in front of this pathway. Move the rocks." Seriously, people, if you have trouble figuring that out, just give up. You are going to live w/ your parents forever.\n\n4. I guess some of the boss type battles require you to figure out how to beat the boss. This puts it in line w/... every game ever.\n\n5. Graphically, it is a good match for the music. It is kinda cartoony, kinda flash style. It is nothing special really but the palate choices are nice and it looks excellent overall.\n\n6. The levels on the first half of the game are dirt simple and easy but the seem to start sprawling kinda randomly towards the middle of the game.\n\n7. Number 7 is no big deal.\n\n8. This does not really play like Metroid but when you are low on lives and health and just know you are about to beat a level if you can just hang on, it sure feels a lot like Metroid.\n\n9. There is some local fauna in the backgrounds that is not hostile but sure as hell looks hostile. If I was a less forgiving man, I would find whoever did this and kill them.\n\n10. I generally don't like playing platformers w/ mouse and keyboard but I felt this one justified it pretty well. I just didn't feel chained to it and some of the functions felt natural to have on the left hand rather than on the right where they would be w/ a controller.\n\n11. The final boss on this is super annoying and long. He's hard and hard final bosses are good but they made him hard by just padding his HP and that is a bummer because the game ends on a down note for that reason.\n\n12. Oh well.\n\n13. Seriously. Awesome sountrack. Solar Fields. Movements.","May 6","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
