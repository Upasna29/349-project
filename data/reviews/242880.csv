I scurry into a forest after the sound of a squadron falls upon my ears; I am in no condition to fight. I wander the forest for a little bit, helplessly watching my vitality droop into the low thirties. I need food, drink, anything.\n\nAnd fast.\n\nAfter crawling through the forest for a few minutes, I hear humming. There is a lone robot here. I scope out the immediate area, hoping to set course away from certain doom. Upon laying eyes on the beast, however, I sit in place, carefully calculating where it was traveling.\n\nFor it was passing an unlooted shack.\n\nI watch the shack and robot from above, for I was stationed on a hill just out of sight. My vitality is hitting the low teens. This shack was is last shot at life, for any village would be too far to not starve. This is my last chance, and I need to spend it wisely. I note the robot's steady patrol around the shack, and sprint when he rounds the corner away from the door. I do not care if I am seen; I could run after I retrieved any food in the shack, and any other course of action would leave me dead.\n\nA meter or so away, I note that I can no longer hear the robot humming. This was either my lucky day, or my last. I got within a few decimeters of the door, so close to life once more.\n\nSnap\n\nThat is all I hear, and all I need to hear. I am dead. The abrupt and loud snap and accompanying crunch can only mean one thing.\n\nI quickly look down to inpect my injured shin, shattered by a perfectly placed bear trap. I quickly try to undo the traps mechanisms, to free myself and run. I am interupted by a loud click above my head, to which I stand up to identify. I am greeted by the barrel of a large gun, and then by a bright light and darkness. I can feel the ground as I land, I feel it welcome me to a long, peaceful slumber. As I fall into eternal sleep, I am greeted with a lullaby, a familiar song that I am unable to name. It was unsettling, however in the way it was sung, or rather, hummed.\n\nAnd it sounded oddly robotic.","June 11, 2015","true","13.3"," 908 of 998 people (91%) found this review helpful 349 people found this review funny","91","908","998","349","12"

There's a lot to like on paper with Sir, and even once you are in the game some of that potential shines through gloriously.\n\nHowever, of this never quite comes together in a cohesive whole. The game feels incomplete, and seems to lack some more substance and depth, in terms of gameplay, goals, and story. The AI of the robots ruthlessly hunting you down is actually quite good, but the process of evasion, distriction, fleeing, and/or fighting them quickly becomes tedious and uninteresting; and this interaction is supposed to be the focus of the gameplay! Often times the best strategy is to just sprint around grabbing your objectives and ignoring the thoughful stealthy approach, which should not really be possible, and essentially breaks the way the game is clearly designed to be played. Also, after the initial cutscene, there is next to no story or world development, which is a somewhat bizarre decision, as the setting is one of the most compelling aspects of the game. Where the hell am I, and what is the backstory of these tweed clad robo-gentlemen? Who is my character, and who is this myserious Butler who speaks at the game's beginning? Why are all these houses abandoned? None of your questions will ever even be acknowledged by the game, let aloned answered, which is a major cop-out for an incrediblely unique and interesting set-up. Additionally, the random world generation, while ambitious and great in theory, doesn't always work out well, and leads to really weird and hard to navigate terrain and towns at times, which also helps to undermine alternative playstyles and the believability of these strange islands actually being a real place.\n\nMuch of this seems to stem from the sudden jump in development from late Alpha to full release earlier this year; as someone who was supporting the game from almost day one, it seemed somewhat inconsistent with the planned development of the game, and the final product is proof of that. I feel that development dragged on internally, and once a workable build without significant bugs was finished, with enough development bullet points technically checked off, and a decent existing player base, the developers pushed the game out, without actually confirming if the game actually worked like they had intended it to. I hesitate to say it, but I would argue it does not.\n\nIf there are any more large updates for Sir to bring some fullness to the package (such as the often promised, but as of yet undelivered exciting competitive/cooperative multiplayer mode), this may still become realized as a great game. And I hope it does because many of the pieces are here, and I would be lying if I said I didn't have good fun with it at times. However I cannot recommend the game in its current and sadly, final state (if the developers are to be believed), and have taken Sir as a lesson in the dangers of supporting overly ambitious early access games, even if the developers are genuine in their intentions.","October 19, 2014","false","8.2"," 954 of 1,074 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","954","1","5","18"

You don't know how many are out there, Just that they will not stop until you are dead.\n\n\nSo what should you do? Run, Try to make a last stand? Could you possibly kill them all, Weaken them?\n\n\nYou take a peek out of the bushes and see them looking through the grove to your right. They are sweeping to area in a counter-clockwise fashion and will soon near you. So you grab a rock and lob it in their general direction, in trying to keep their soulless eyes away from your hiding place.\n\n\nSuccess! The rock appears to distract the hunters from your impending ousting. You wait for them to turn their backs to you while they attempt to find the source of the noise.\n\n\nThis is your chance! You decide to take out the first hunter you see and make a break for it. You grip your pistol with both hands and start squeezing on the trigger, raising your weapon up in front of you. The crude sights aiming near the sounds of footsteps and crunching of the grass.\n\n\nNow! You burst out of the brush and hastily fire off two shots into the back of one of the automatons before veering into the opposite direction of the group.\n\n\nYou hope you sent that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to android hell.\n\n\nYou assume you are southbound but you don't have time to check your compass.\n\n\n"I'll try to find a path out of this place later, the only thing that matters now is that this direction is away from those monsters."\n\n\nInhuman screeching followed by gunshots breaks your train of thought as bullets whiz past you. Your speed doubles and your heart pounds faster than it has even pounded before. You were never a working man, your legs and heart used to feel as if you had just ran a marathon after you went up the stairs.\n\n\nThe fact that you are possibly having a heart attack is the least of your worries right now as a second volley of lead is the more immediate danger.\n\n\nYou make it over a hill and believe you have broken the predators line of sight.\n\n\nThey will catch up soon, think fast! You leap over a fence and sprint towards a nearby ditch. You lie down in an attempt to make yourself less visible and make yourself quieter. You start piling mud on top of yourself to make some impromptu camouflage.\n\n\nCatching your breath you greedily inhale air for your deprived lungs. You hear voices approach and you slow your breath, hoping that they will ignore you and move past. You hear the wet thumps of metal hitting mud as the pack nears you. Your body tenses up just like the metal demons that are hunting you. You attempt to stay quiet and motionless as they search through the nearby brush searching for you before you finally hear them move on. You lay for what seems to be the longest few minutes of your life before letting out the longest sigh of your life as you reflect on these last few hours and how you nearly died multiple times. The last words you heard before you were deposited on this accursed archipelago echo through your mind.\n\n"Sir, You are being hunted."","December 16, 2013","true","3.3"," 485 of 543 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","485","543","0","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/242880/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Sir, You Are Being Hunted is definitely unique in the genre of procedurally-generated survival games. Yes, there's a procedurally-generated landscape for you to explore making each game unique but there's a clear goal in the game: you've to retrieve various scattered fragments of a machine spread over five islands and bring them back to a stone circle on the center island. Each island is a randomly-generated landscape but you select a theme for them individually like Mountain, Castle, or Industrial. It helps making each island visually unique as it can become tricky later on in the game remembering which areas you've visited.\nActually finding scattered fragments is tricky; despite a white plume of smoke emanating from them, they'll be spread over a wide area and if the weather is overcast or foggy, then you're going to be searching for a long time.A compass point at the top of the screen will show you where the stone circle is located, along with boats which act as save points as well as transport to the other islands. The fragments themselves aren't marked so you've got to start surveying the landscape as best you can while avoiding detection and keeping yourself well fed.\nWhat's also interesting is the game gives you a range of starting classes. Although there's no mechanical differences between them, each has a unique set of starting items. The Aristocrat (the default option), Officer, and Gamekeeper have a lot of immediately useful items, like bandages, traps and weapons. The Cook, Inventor, the Old Soak, and Artist are more orientated towards either food or esoteric items.\nIn truth, you could pick any class you wanted because you'll have to scavenge and forage as soon as possible. Your vitality is always dropping and in order to keep it up, you'll need to eat or drink what you can find in various buildings across all the islands. Whether it's some dubious eggs, marmalade, or some nourishing stout ale, keeping your vitality will allow your health to regenerate; if it drops too low then you're going to die quickly in a skirmish.\nHowever, Sir, You Are Being Hunted reveals itself to be a mixed bag when it comes to the actual business of being hunted. Often times you'll see a small posse of hunters stroll past not too far from you without worry; others, you'll see a pair simply loitering around some buildings. While initially worrying, you'll soon learn to simply stick to some long grass and avoid them.\nWhat's more inconvenient are times where you find hunters sticking really close to a fragment that you've spotted from a distance. It's possible to distract them with a flying bottle, but it's frustrating when the fragment is located on an open patch of ground which means you'll be spotted anyway.\nEven more annoying is when the landscape works against you and puts a fragment in a really hard-to-reach spot; I found out one of the last fragments I was searching for was on top of a rocky outcrop by the shore. It was inaccessible on all sides, there were two robots patrolling the area, and a big tentacle monster killed me after I spent too much time in the water. Rare as this may be, these situations essentially halt all progress you've made and require a total restart.\nWhen it does all come together, Sir, You Are Being Hunted delivers a tense atmosphere that's unlike anything else. When you get close to any robotic hunter, you'll hear gentle music cues that really make you feel the pressure; even just the quirky robotic warbling you hear emanating from your hunters is nerve-racking.\nAs you collect fragments, you'll start to see enemies like the Landowner on the horizon and feel the urgency rise. Finding those fragments as fast as possible suddenly becomes the most important thing you can do. Unlike many games, even though you can pick up lots of items and weapons, you never feel truly empowered and the enemies are never a push over. A pair of basic hunters can still pick you off without too much trouble and believe me, they will.\nWith too many enemies present, Sir, You Are Being Hunted would simply be an open-world shooter, but with too few, it would be boring. While many might find its empty spaces dull, they always carry with them a hidden threat that a pipe-smoking robot has you in its crosshairs with its steely finger on the trigger.","July 22, 2015","true","9.0"," 248 of 260 people (95%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","95","248","260","17","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/242880/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","A lot of games benefit from having random or procedural elements, but it never occurred to me to apply those principles to a stealth game. I always thought stealth games needed to be tightly tuned, with carefully-designed levels and sharp AIs on patrol routes and such. Sir is very much a stealth game that benefits from randomness, but not without some significant drawbacks.\n\nSir drops you into the middle of five randomly-generated islands, each populated by murderous metallic monsieurs out for your human hide. A mysterious device brought you here, and is now scattered into 16 pieces across the archipelago. Each piece must be returned to the standing stones at the center of the center isle if you are to return home. To aid you in your task, there's a whole host of items to scavenge up, some useful, some not. As you find more pieces, the robots step up their efforts, including robo-dogs, scarecrow sentries, hot air balloons, and more monstrous machines to hunt you down.\n\nThe robots are the heart of this game, and they are at times terrifying. Sure, they make conspicuous beep-boop noises as you draw near, but once they spot you with that heart-stopping bleep, you're in deep trouble. The 'bots are almost as fast as you, but they have guns and are pretty good shots with them. They're also intelligent about chasing you, following as far as they saw you go and then making educated guesses about where to search from there. Most robot patrol the islands in groups, paying close attention to structures that can be scavenged but following and suspicious leads they find. Other robots mill around the artifacts you need to recover, making sure you have to deal with some of them to get home. Getting caught can spell disaster if you can't get away fast enough, or if they plug you with a lucky shot that leaves you bleeding out.\n\nYou have two important numbers to keep track of, Health and Vitality. Either one bottoms out, you're done. Health regens slowly unless you've been shot, in which case you need to bandage yourself up using an item. Vitality drains over time with activity, and must be restored with food. And THAT means risking patrols to sneak into abandoned villages and churches to loot. You can't enter any structure in the game; the doors to buildings serve as loot containers. It's a bit of a blow to immersion and options for hiding, but other than that the loot system is solid. You have limited space to store weapons and traps, food and bandages, and any other interesting odds and ends you find. It's up to you to figure out what use some items have, which adds an element of mystery and experimentation to the game.\n\nYou can only save at the standing stones or the boats to other islands, so you really have to think twice about risky moves. Stealth in this game is tricky... it seems more based on proximity than action, and the robots are good about looking over their shoulders. Proper sneaking takes a long time given the distances, and waiting for patrols to move on is the safest but most time-consuming route. I'm still learning how to deal with them, but honestly I've been able to run by and grab a few artifacts right in front of them without being murdered. Getting caught can be frustrating though, given how hard the robots are to lose. You can fight back if you find weapons, but combat is not a focus and can be pretty fiddly. And in terms of navigation, you have a compass that marks the boats, but if you want to get any additional use out of it you have to find a map and mark it up yourself with points of interest.\n\nIs it a good game? Yes, but one you have to put time into. Finding 16 fragments across 5 islands is going to take time, even moreso if you play the stealth game right, scavenge diligently, and use your map to the fullest. The randomization keeps the game fresh but can lead to situations where you're trapped between patrols for extended periods or find artifacts in nigh-impossible locations. It's not a particularly attractive game either, with some low-poly models and muddy textures. But if you can settle into it and give it some time, it'll keep you busy for a good long while.","September 18, 2015","true","1.3"," 153 of 159 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","153","159","7","2"

The best the game musters is its hunger system, which encourages scavenging the abandoned settlements where robots are more likely to patrol. Alas, early on in my game I shot and cooked two rabbits. This simple task, plus occasional visits to unguarded buildings, led to me finishing the game with enough rabbit in my trousers to feed a poorhouse.\n\nThe wide open terrain also works against interaction by giving the player too much information and too many choices. There is always plenty of warning of approaching bots, and there is always more than enough space to hide in until they pass. When the player is spotted, running and hiding in the open are both farces.\n\nThe game compounds all of this with a thinly-spread checkpoint save system, punishing experimentation and killing curiosity. Developers: please stop doing this.\n\nWith the player relegated to an observer it’s just as well that the bots are fun to watch. Pathfinding AI is robust, with sensible group dynamics, and the designs are imaginative and distinctive riffs on various aristocratic stereotypes.\n\nProcedural island generation is also reliable. Yet despite each biome having one special feature (Castle and Industrial, added later in development, shine in this regard) they otherwise all merge into one brown lump. The slightly different items sprinkled on top aren’t enough to create anything memorable and it doesn’t help that they offer no apparent variation in robot behaviour, type or numbers.\n\nWhich brings me to the subject of pacing. Here it is in one sentence: the more macguffins you collect, the more robots there are. You will otherwise finish the game in the same way you started: avoiding bands of robots until you find a macguffin, then killing or distracting the two (always two!) low-level robots guarding it, then scurrying back to the nearest checkpoint while again avoiding all contact with anything.\n\nThe letters scattered about try to hang a wider narrative on these bones, but they are so rare that multiple play-throughs are required to join any dots together – and that is not a prospect I relish.","May 4, 2014","false","5.1"," 927 of 1,190 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","927","1","0","23"

In the past I made it clear how disappointed I was with how the game was turning out, and now I'd like to step back and review the game, the developers, and the history of both in their entirety.\n\nThe game taken completely by itself, with no consideration of the developers or the Alpha development phase, I feel is a decent but flawed stealth shooter. There's some fun to be had in sneaking around in the tall grass, but nearly every other aspect of the game has something wrong with it.\n\nExploring is flawed in that there are far too many "dead zones" with nothing interactive in them.\n\nLooting is flawed in that nearly all loot is gotten from largely non-interactive buildings, as enemies rarely have valuable things to offer when defeated. This is also a flaw of combat, since the lack of valuable items means there is very little reward for winning a gunfight.\n\nCombat is also not exceptionally fun because it doesn't have much gravity. Bleeding can be cured with a single button, health regenerates, and most enemies are weak and easily evaded or defeated.\n\nMusic doesn't appear to play a large role in the game. I recall hearing an opening theme, which was interesting, but not memorable.\n\nGraphically, the game has a lot of heart, which I appreciate, but at the same time it's got a very dated, rushed look. Most objects have bland, flat textures and barely react graphically to light. Even the guns looks like they're made of matte plastic, not wood and steel.\n\nThe rushed look is present in other elements of the game as well, such as the user interface, which lacks key features like a quick option to discard something (there's no discard button, there's no dragging the item off the inventory screen, there's no icon to drag over, just a context menu opened with M2) or the ability to stack similar items (bullets cannot be stacked once separated, be careful with your rifle ammo).\n\nAnimations look sped up and choppy, though this may be on purpose for the robots. There are no reload animations, instead the character lowers his guns offscreen and reload sounds are played.\n\nAnd finally, the AI is not exceptionally good at tracking you. Even the searchlight, which can see you even when you're perfectly hidden, will forget where you are if you're near a building.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's worth a play if you could pick it up on sale, but it's certainly not worth $20, not for this level of roughness around the edges.\n\nNow, taking into consideration this game had an alpha stage in which quite a bit of money was raised for its complete development, and that there are multiple developers who have had years to fine-tune and polish the game, the overall image becomes considerably less positive. Instead of appearing to be due to time delays or personal problems, the lacking aspects appear to be due to developer inexperience or possibly even laziness.\n\nIt has been made clear to me that the developers are a team of ten or so people with decent but not exceptional talent in making games. It has also been made clear that funding was a large concern for them during development. However, a similarly sized team with inconsistent funding and only two experienced game designers was responsible for the creation of GoldenEye 64, which was lauded as one of the greatest first-person shooter games of all time and maintains that status even now (96 on Metacritic, compared to this game's 63). If a team with similar resources and worse technology can make something so memorable, the only thing keeping the developers of SYABH from doing the same is the developers themselves.\n\nIt's an unpleasant but well-known fact that game developers who are paid for their work ahead of time can be known to cut corners or even abandon projects at a whim. KickStarter and IndieGogo are rife with such half-finished and abandoned projects. This game, while at the very least playable and somewhat enjoyable, is certainly not finished, and definitely should not have been released from alpha in its current state.\n\nAnd this doesn't even take into account the fact that many of the lacking features were requested by the community, but outright ignored by the developers during the alpha phase. One of the most requested features was interactive buildings, even something as simple as a 3d door that opened when interacted with. All of these were labeled "too difficult to implement" by the developers and ignored.\n\nThis reveals much of their mentality during development. Even during the alpha stage, they'd already decided what the scope of game would be like. Implying that the community had any say in the matter was at best misleading and at worst outright lying. Furthermore, since they already had the finshed project in mind, releasing the game from alpha stage is a sign that they consider that pre-defined scope nearly reached. The fact that they're currently working on additions that do not expand gameplay, such as bugfixes for already implemented features and controller support, seems to enforce this conclusion.\n\nI bought this game when it was on sale during its alpha phase and followed the development for quite some time before it became apparent to me that these developers were not going to produce a finished game. It appears instead they've opted to produce the bare minimum according to their own standards and not the community's.

Picked it up during a monster Steam sale -- I think for like 90% off or something -- and it was definitely worth the ~$3CAD but probably not the full price of >$20.\n\nSir (or Madam), You Are Being Hunted is a sandbox first-person stealth game set in a vaguely Edwardian time period where you, the protagonist, get stranded on a series of islands and are hunted by murderous robots. Your goal -- to travel to each island (five in all) and acquire pieces of a machine to transport you to safety. All the while, you have to mind your hunger and scavenge for items like food, bullets, weapons, and alarm clocks. The islands are procedurally generated with each game with a choice of one of five biome types. I really like the procedural islands; each biome is different and they feel natural and well thought out. On the default setting, the game starts with a few robot  hunters and, as you collect more pieces, ramps up the difficulty until finding those last pieces becomes seriously difficult.\n\nThe good and the bad (caveat: I haven't finished the game yet because of the serious difficulty mentioned above):\n\nGood:\nProcedural generation: I'm a sucker for it, my favourite game genre of all time is roguelikes, and this is roguelike-y in random generation of the islands, the buildings and the enemies.\n\nStealth: this game is at heart very stealth oriented, inasmuch as even if you do find weapons going in with guns blazing, even on the lower levels, is not a winning strategy. Bullets are scarce, weapons are scarce, and there are way more of the enemy than there is of you. It's entirely possible to play the game without shooting any weapon at all, which I find refreshing.\n\nGraphics: I game on Linux, which okay, I'm already at a disadvantage, and I game with a low-endish business model Thinkpad, which again, problematic, but the game is smooth as anything on my machine and still is graphically nice to look at. Well, "nice" in that the game is simulating a depressing English countryside, so colours are muted and browns, grays, dull greens abound, but that's ok.\n\nSound: Surprisingly this game is *very* sound oriented. Don't try to play without having your sound on; you'll get clobbered. You'll need to hear the robots approaching -- each type has a distinctive sound -- in order to avoid them. There's an option in the game to turn on an indicator, which puts a little Metal Gear Solid-ish "!", "?" above the robots' heads to gauge how aware they are of you, and this is *invaluable* - at least if you're playing the game without headphones -- but even so you'll have to listen hard to survive.\n\nRepeatability: There are *lots* of options to tune the robots appearances and numbers. I haven't messed with this yet as I want to finish the game on the default, but it's great to have something beyond "Easy, Medium, Hard" for difficulty.\n\nGender: It's a small thing, but the fact that you can pick your gender is a good one. More games should do this.\n\nBad:\nStealth: hey wait, didn't I just put stealth in the "good"? Yeah. But in this game you spend a *lot* of time crouched in reeds or ducking behind buildings while all the while your vitality trickles to zero. This does present a nice amount of tension to the game, but the islands are *big* muthas and finding the pieces without the piece detector is hard enough; trying to find them blind is *really* hard. And when you've spent hours combing an island to find that last piece, while all the while the *hordes* of robots that populate the endgame are shooting you, trapping you in bear traps, running you over with rocket horses, and biting your foot it gets real frustrating real fast.\n\nSound: I have a mild hearing disability and I don't particularly like games that are super dependent on sound, so I sort of resent the fact that I *have* to have sound turned on in this one. Not sure how it would work without it though.\n\nItems: The primary way one gets ahold of things is by searching buildings for them, and there are a *lot* of junk items you can't actually do anything with. I would love an option to turn off junk items because it's annoying to go to a door and just find bones. You can't do anything with junk -- not even throw it as a distraction -- so I'm not sure why the designers included the junk items in the game at all. As far as I can see, they serve no purpose beyond annoying window dressing.\n\nBuildings: The buildings look great, but you can't go inside them. They exist solely as a cache for (mostly) junk items. The game would be improved greatly if you could enter a building and peek out a window, or have, say, fixed items to heal damage, like beds or something. Instead they're basically giant crates.\n\nI'd say, eh, three and half stars out of five to four stars out of five depending on your tolerance for frustration in the difficult endgame.","July 1, 2015","true","14.8"," 127 of 138 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","127","138","2","3"

"Sir (or Madam), You Are Being Hunted" is a 'procedurally-generated' first person shooter, set in a hilariously extreme British world, where robot gentlemen hunt humans for sport.\nThe game does a lot of things right. The setting is unique, as is the plot. Your job, as the human, is to survive against the robotic apocalypse and track down fragments of a teleportation device that will get you safely out of this 'tweedpunk' nightmare. There are 25 fragments, scattered across five islands. If and when you are caught, the robots will not hesitate to shoot. Should you lose all your health and fall to the ground, you'll be sent back to the place where you last saved.\nAn impressive array of weapons awaits you, however, should you pick and choose your battles wisely. There are weapons ranging from the close-encounter woodcutter's axe to the fine hunting rifle, along with a pistol, shotgun, and blunderbuss. Ammo is scarce, and should be conserved.\nAlong with ammo and weaponry, there are foodstuffs and bandages. If you've ever played Minecraft, you understand that eating food doesn't refill your health. It refills your hunger, which when close to 100%, heals your health. Sir, You Are Being Hunted is very similar. As you traverse the British countryside, your vitality will drop. Eating food will raise that, which will in turn raise your health, should you be recovering from an encounter.\ntl;dr, This game is great. You'll laugh, you'll jump, and you'll have a heck of a lot of fun. I totally recommend this game, to anyone who enjoys stealthy shoot and loot type games.","January 26, 2014","true","17.6"," 199 of 248 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","199","248","0","0"

Yet, it was a mixed experience overall. My biggest issues were;\n\n1)The trailer is quite misleading. The game has pretty gloomy and dark atmosphere, not comical as the trailer was. So my initial feeling was disappointment, because game was nothing that the trailer made it look to be. But eventually, the atmosphere of the game stands on its own. Just be prepared that the game is not as funny as the trailer.\n\n2)I didnt feel that the procedural system adds anything to the game. The environments are made randomly for each playthrough, but there is not enough variery in the landscape patterns to make any worthwhile differences via procedural system. Its the same barren lands, and having the same trees in little different places doesnt really enchant the gameplay. The game is not a roguelike either. When you die (and you die very easily), you dont start the game from a 0, but just load a checkpoint. This imho kills the point of randomly generated world, since you dont need to really adapt into new world every time you play it, like you would do in Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, Spelunky, etc. In this game, I kept thinking that it would be much better, if the open world was well planned solid world full of unique situations, instead of a procedural world.\n\n3)Sneaking is too hard, and too punishing. The distances in the game are very very long, and most of the gametime you will be running from point A to B, without really sneaking. But when you reach a point where you "must" sneak, often its better just to shoot the enemy who is in your way, and run away as fast as you can. Doing proper sneaking can take a lot, lot of time, and getting spotted by enemy when too near to them is almost 100% death to you, which will mean a lot and lot of time wasted due to rare checkpoints. If you run and gun instead, you will lose only a 1-2 minutes of your time (most spent on running), instead of 10-20 minutes you would spend trying to sneak properly.\n\nOverall I was somewhat disappointed with the game, but liked the idea and style of it enough, that I wish the developers move into a new interesting and unique projects soon. Apparently this game is getting a multiplayer someday, but IMHO its waste of time of the devs, and they should just make a new game instead. For time being, I can still recommend this game to the people who are fascinated by the idea, even though it has its share of problems.","October 26, 2014","true","12.1"," 130 of 166 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","130","166","0","0"

Maybe im fanboying here, but this game is awesome if you play it the right way.\nI've started without watching any trailer, without knowing anything about the game. Just after a few minutes I got into the system and immediately felt the survival aspect. After gathering some orbs, a new robot comes into play, which is a cool feature itself, but the discovery of it is the main thing. Wandering through the woods and seeing just a glimpse of a robot you have never seen before, wanting to get a closer look but without risking your life.\nI have to mention, I don't use the save-function. I play 'hardcore' which adds some more of the survival instinct and makes me overthink my actions. As the maps are all random generated, it makes sense to start over from a whole new map.\nAs there are 5 different Islands and each one has its own theme, it is again all about the discovery, still in mind that some robot could spot you while you are admiring an interesting building or strucuture. The balance between "I really want to see what that is" and "I hope it doesn't kill me though" is perfect.\nLike I said, it might be the fanboy effect I'm suffering from, but I got this from various chases through the woods, resulting in a firefight in a small village, while trying to get some robots into a trap I originally set up just to gather another one of these crystals.\nThis game is brilliant.

I expected the rush of being the target of a manhunt, but got a scavenger hunt with a heavy emphasis on inventory management. The procedurally generated worlds look nice, but are often repetitive and mostly empty. Optimizing a limited, grid-based inventory can be time consuming enough to break immersion. Having limited inventory for a game like this is great, but having to reorganize a grid-based inventory to pick up an item when enough space is availabe is annoying (has anyone ever felt like they were being hunted when playing with Tangrams?). Buildings break immersion since they function as treasure chests instead of buildings. (I knew that going into the game and thought it wouldn't bother me, but I was incorrect).\n\nUnfortunately, Sir, You Are Being Hunted fails to make me feel like I am being hunted and breaks immersion too often to maintain my interest.","May 4, 2014","false","4.1"," 183 of 280 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","183","280","0","2"

It's a tense game of cat mouse where factions of "tweedpunk" robot hunters scour the dreary British archipelago looking to hunt down, you start with only some basic healing items and bincoulers. You can find weapons by searching houses and sheds and even rubish bins. Although attempting to fight the robots should genreally be left as a final option as the fighting mechanics are purposefully left shanky, floaty and with high recoil as you play a scientest not a soldier and the robot hunters are a much better shot then you will likely find your self, outmanned, out gunned, and low on ammo. The game balances funny with suspense, the randomness of the archpealgo generation makes for reat fun as hiding in a wheat field less then a foot away from a hunting party holding my breath waiting for them t pass away far enough to make my move towards the town they had just departed from is one of the best moments I have felt in game in a long while.

Indeed, with my eldest son having largely commandeered the console, leaving me with the laptop and mobile devices, it seemed I was wandering into the realms of the casual gamer.\n\nAnd then I came across Sir, You Are Being Hunted. The visual style and sense of humour lulled me in in and when I saw, yes, my word, it will run on my laptop, I decided to take the plunge.\n\nBuy, install, test. Yes, it seems to be working fine. I'll give it a proper go tomorrow.\n\nWell, maybe tomorrow.\n\nTomorrow.\n\nAfter a month of tomorrows I finally sat down to play it properly and... yes.\n\nThis game has it all for me, a veteran of stealth since Tenchu and Metal Gear Solid, here was a game that allowed greater flexibility than even they allowed. Sure, it allows you to make more mistakes and it can be very unforgiving when it wants to be, but what we have here is a very solid game.\n\nYou, a gentleman or lady of apparently some standing have been transported to a strange alternate Britain, populated by a variety of robots who seem focussed on making your days end. Gentleman hunters, with synthesized Upper-Class British accents are you initial foils, but soon a whole range of robotic country-pursuits types are also on your trail, from poachers to foxhunters and of course, the robotic force-of-nature which is the Landowner.\n\nTo escape, you need to collect several parts of a machine scattered across the five islands, returning them to a set of standing stones at the heart of the map.\n\nYou have weapons and traps available to find, as well as a number of items to help distract your opponents and, of course, food to keep yourself alive.\n\nVastly outnumbered, stealth is the key to victory here. Sure, you can try to slog your way through the robotic hordes but that is unlikely to end well for anybody. Rather you are encouraged to explore and retrieve what you need by subterfuge, or perhaps through use of a rusty trombone.\n\nSo, the gae itself. Lets look at the negatives first. The world is precedurally generated, which is great for variety but it sometimes seems that this makes the landscape you biggest enemy from time to time. I've never had a problem with beyond some locations being fiendishly difficult to get to, but it seems others have been completely stymied by this.\n\nThe graphics are great for such a small team and have an excellent visual identity of their own, but especially at night there are a couple of glitches that sometimes give you cause to pause, was that the flash of something significant, or just a glitch in the landscape.\n\nAnd of course, thr focus, this isn't a big narrative game, this is a game that gives you a world and a mission and lets you get on with it. Don't expect AAA production values here...\n\n...but...\n\nthat's a good thing. You see, the designers have come up with a good idea. This is a clever open-world stealth game that rewards ingenuity, careful planning and the occasional bout of gung-ho bravado. This is a game that is not afraid of stacking the odds against you and leaving you to your own devices. If there are insurmountable odds between you and your target do you wait it out, try and sneak through anyway, or just back off and live to fight another day? The game is certainly challenging in this way and with this in mind, the ones who will be most disappointed with it are those who like to be led through a game by their noses, or rely on quick reflexes to blast their way through a horde of opponents.\n\nAs a stealth game, its a welcome return to form from a genre that had lost impetus in recent years and as the kind of person who would once upon a time sit patiently watching guards waiting for that perfect moment, this game has rekindled my enthusiasm.\n\nAs mentioned, Graphically you are not looking at detailed character models, but beautifully stylised creations that can bring a smile to yoru faces with their occasional nuances and the scenery fantastically evokes the British countryside. Sound is equally well thought out, with a balance of excellent natural cues and some brilliant audio for the hunters themselves (The gentleman hunters somehow manage to come across as upper-class Cylons). The sound design will be as much of an ally in this game as anything else and playing with headphones is warranted.\n\nThe Keyboard/Mouse controls are responsive and clean and the HUD and inventory interfaces are straightforward and intuitive.\n\nFrankly, Sir or Madam, this game has brought be a lot more joy than the last few TripleA games I bought and that is an achievement in itself. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to set my hat at a jaunty angle and go and explore the North Island again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kean865/recommended/242880/","kean865","Riiakhan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kean865/","252 products in account","This game becomes repetitive really quickly and doesn't have enough content in it to make it worthwhile the amount of time it'd take to finish it. You have to find pieces scattered around generated islands and bring them back to the starting position to do 'something' (What that something is I don't know, I never finished it). As you progress new enemies will appear that will ramp up the difficulty. The way I see it this game has 3 main elements, combat, stealth and exploration.\n\nThe exploration aspect of the game is extremely lacking as there is rarely anything interesting to find. Just more and more houses to scavenge for supplies and the occasional 'something' piece. You can find diaries and stuff that help you understand the setting but they are rare'ish loot and without them there is barely any kind of narrative. It's just not fun to explore because there is nothing worth finding. Just more random houses that does nothing.\n\nThe combat in the game is boring, I understand that it is not meant to be a combat oriented game and that you need to preserve your resources in order to survive long-term, but whenever combat 'does' happen it is extremely clunky. I ended up just sitting behind a wall and then waiting for a robot to pop around the corner so I could blow the head off and that's it. There are traps you can use (which are especially useful for the robot dogs) but the enemies might not walk into a trap and then you might be ♥♥♥♥ out of luck.\n\nAnd finally, the stealth, in order to not attract attention you need to sneak around sometimes but when you progress far enough into the game it becomes a necessity to stealth in order to avoid being cluster♥♥♥♥ed by dogs. The problem? It's a sandbox world where you have to travel large distances. It isn't fun to move the speed of a slug when all you want to is to just get another damn 'something' piece. The stealth works well enough on its own merits but the problem is the amount of distance you need to travel 'and' the necessity to use stealth. It becomes tedious real fast.\n\nThe setting is really interesting, the enemies are well designed, the concept behind stealthing around and using resources is great. But the gameplay is boring, repetitive and tedious.\n\nWhat the game needs is a stronger narrative, it needs to ditch the generated islands in favor for consistent set-pieces, it needs to polish the resources system, the healing system and the combat system. It needs to have something more worthwhile to find while exploring, like unique mini-bosses, NPC's, locations, puzzles and traps. And it needs to ditch the extremely repetitive "Fetch 24 'something' pieces" for a more clear and focused story.\n\nIf a sequel does what I just suggested then I'm definitely getting it. But 'this' game? It ain't worth it. Even on sale.","November 2, 2014","false","1.3"," 116 of 178 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","116","178","0","0"

The mix of FPS ,Stealth and Survival mechanics come together pretty nice in this game.The controls are your standard FPS set up,so its cake if you play any fps games. I think what grabs you the most and draws you in is the look and the atmosphere of this game. This is what a good team does with the Unity Engine (Incomeing Unity Haters in 5...4...3...2...1.. :P ).\n\nThe only draw back i think this game is missing is 2 things Co-Op and Steam Workshop !! I think these two things would have brought me over the top with this title!But all in all a killer single player game!\n\n{Hold on governor...Just got this new news over the call box} Wait what...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morganov/recommended/242880/","morganov","Plissken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morganov/","361 products in account","Having recently finished a ritual slog through the rebooted ‘Thief’ (How I forced myself to play through the entirety of that dross I can only attribute to some kind of rabid frothing loyalty to the genius of the original) anyone could be forgiven that thinking that stealth – and I mean real stealth (Forgetteth not Original Thief, Hitman: Blood Money, System Shock etc.) was surely dead. Perhaps the harsh unforgiving landscape of the original hard-core PC genre is simply too much for the AAA studios of today to stomach - given how most of their output has become about as creatively impotent as Michael Bay directing the latest Transformers snore-fest. Well it turns out not all is lost as once again an indie darling swoops in to save the genre with the excellent (if not perfect) Sir, you are being hunted.\n\n\nBut steady on now dear boy! What’s it all about?\n\nStarting with a wonky hand drawn cutscene (Though narrated by an excellently plummy butler voice-over) the simple premise is presented: Being stranded on a series of very British Isles you are tasked with recovering a series of scattered mystical stone artefacts to activate a kind of magical Stonehenge endgame – a simple but effective plot device not only permitting but encouraging the open ended ramble you embark on. Oh - and all the while avoiding the murderous but delightfully polite gentlemen robots who, if you didn't quite catch it already, are out to hunt you.\n\n\nGo on then, spill the beans! Is it any good?\n\nEndeavouring to avoid the very British habit of meandering around the point I should start by stating the most important thing you need to know: The stealth works. And golly is it a thrilling chase! Sir, makes use of its gloriously procedural open(ish) world and enemy placement to generate a genuinely compelling rhythm of long eerie walks, interrupted by tense moments of avoidance as you slip by patrolling hunters and the occasional run in with live fire in response to which you mostly run for the hills (But often rather the safe bosom of stealth-friendly shrubs and long grass).\n\n\nDetails man, I need the details!\n\nWhile a shocking amount of AAA games still continue to pile on such migraine inducing modern videogame tropes as overzealous tutorials, quick time events and general (Console era) hand holding, Sir, plays like a greatest hits of all the classic stealth and RPG mechanics of 90s with a dash of the modern survival genre throw in there for good measure. You will manage a classic grid style inventory system. Your enemies will not patronise you with obnoxious alert level visual indicators. You will bleed out in seconds unless you brought bandages with you (And can apply them fast enough). You will not be guided by point defeating objective markers. You will shoot, cook and eat pheasant if you want any chance of surviving your time in the country. In short – jolly good times ahead!\n\nWith its short but well-structured runtime Sir, can also evoke some very special moments of player agency. Its clever reinterpretation of the classic scaling challenge/empowerment mechanic, invite new opportunities for emergent character development: Building resources and confidence you can eventually embolden yourself to take on the hunters - the cathartic fantasy of transformation from prey to predator or Garret the Master Thief to Gordon Freeman if you like. However with stealth and avoidance mechanics as enjoyable as they are you’d certainly not be missing out to ghost you way through the entire experience given your ruthlessly oppressive and increasingly thorough adversaries.\n\nOh, and did I mention it’s quite funny? Yes indeed. It seems no one is better at capitalising on the pastoral, fox and hound theme than mocker-in-chief (And game designer) Jim Rossignol – a Brit himself. I’m not sure the quintessentially British sense of humour will tickle everyone’s fancy but if the image of homicidal robots drinking tea is enough to muster a chuckle you’ll probably be ok.\n\n\nSo, you’re saying it’s rather good then?\n\nSir you are being Hunted is an inspired stealth gem not to mention a legitimate vision for the genre’s future. Despite its modest graphics chops, Sir, evokes a mythical version of the British countryside we almost forgot existed. The pervasive sense of danger, juxtaposed against that ancient, almost ethereal beauty conjures a unique sense of place that will linger long in the memory after your short adventure/ordeal ends.\n\n\nWell then - Bloody good show! Carry on.\n\nIf you liked that piece check out my game review site:\nwww.tonnochiroad.com\nThanks for reading.

After playing this game for an extended period and then turning it off, I had a real "coming out of the cave" moment. I felt relieved to be back in reality where I'm not the only living human, robots aren't hunting me, and the weather doesn't constantly suck.\n\nFunny thing is, I'm really looking forward to coming back to that world in my next play session. It seriously feels like a warzone, but not the kind you'd see in Modern Warfare. It's the kind you'd see in Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket".  Buildings are falling apart and the environment is dusky and depressing. Sometimes the silence is punctuated by a fire fight off in the distance as bots start infighting with each other. It's a dangerous environment where you rarely get a chance to relax.\n\nAnd then the game gets unsettling. When you hear an unearthly....."sound" off in the distance and see a giant landowner limping about with its two guard dog bots following. Or when you get impatient and attract the attention of a squad of bots when you're low on ammo. They know you're there, and they relish in the hunt. Which is made apparant by their creepy robotic laughter as they creep ever closer to your hastily chosen and flimsy hiding spot. And after waiting with baited breath with your finger on the trigger as a bot just barely uncovers your hiding place, you hear a siren go off and the area around you bathed in red light. Turns out you weren't paying attention to the balloon sentry floating around the area, and now you have to make a split second decision. Fight for your life, or try to run and hide, hoping that any bullets that penetrate your backside don't do enough damage to end you. Because it's been an hour since you last saved at the waypoint, and it would be terrible to have to find all those hard earned items again.\n\nI'm not kidding when I say that this very scenario happened to me. I have the sweat that was accumulating on my brow to prove it. I just barely managed to escape with just 2 points of health remaining, and my heart didn't stop pounding until well after I managed to get back to the waypoint to save. It's a kind of terror that is rooted in reality. I would've lost a ton of items if I had died. God knows what would've happened if I had decided to stand and fight.\n\nThe "brutally funny" description that the developers decided to go with puzzles me. Because at least for me, this game is one of the most tense and stressful experiences I've had in awhile. In a good way.

I have one negative comment, but it is not necessarily a complaint: this game is butt-ugly. Even if the game had been released a decade ago, it would still be tough to look at. The interface and the menus have some charm, but overall the environments and animations are just crude at best.

The enemy A.I. is stupid and will not actively hunt you like the game seems to suggest, and any sense of terror or tension is almost entirely lost the minute that you realize that.

It's a good game, but it's too compacted down.  The day/night cycles are a little short and the maps are a little claustrophibic.  You have to eat every 20 minutes, which is not what I would want to do if I was stalking for 3 days irl.  I'd probably only want to eat once in a 3 day period irl, but in this game, if you don't eat within 20 minutes, you will die!\n\nAlso, even though this game is about stalking for 3 days, it's also about being stalked for 3 days, which is fine, except the robots are everywhere and pretty tightly packed (because of the claustrophobic maps).  The gameplay is fine though, and it's a good game, but it's not a game about wandering the wilderness for several days, perhaps not seeing another person the entire time.\n\nWhat I really hope for is a survival game where you can't see another person or hostile entity for a long time.  You cover your tracks and travel light, taking only what you need and surviving hardcore mode.  When you see another person, you stalk them for 3 days, because there is great risk involved in getting close!  That is the game I want, but this is not that game.  It gives a small taste of what that game might be though and so I will recommend this game.","December 30, 2014","true","1.2"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","24","36","3","0"

Where can I begin?\n\nFirstly, the entire setting is wonderful. An archipelago of islands filled with deserted towns and houses, being watched over by Tweed-Donning robots with a taste for tea and murder. Exploring the islands is great fun, as you must always be on the lookout for roaming hunters and their dogs, hot air balloons lighting up your position or the Landowner, a fearsome robot with a cane that is well accustomed to crushing various bones and organs. Some variation in setting between islands whilst keeping the same British-Grey colour palette allows each area to be individual but memorable. The Castle biome has many ruined walls and turrets of old fortifications, while the Industrial Biome has larger towns with great chimneys and drilling platforms. Finding landmarks in the terrain that are often guarded by the posh automatons makes exploring no walk in the park, and adds to the tension and sense of adventure this game can create.\n\nThe enemies are very well designed, with types varying from the standard Winchester-wielding Hunters to the turbo-charged  robo-horses that are ridden by jockeys determined to run you over. The big cheese of all the robots is the Landowner who, as mentioned before, is a formidable opponent that must be avoided or outwitted in order to survive his metallic glare. Enemy variation doesn't stop there, and the combinations these types of robots can be found in can make taking certain Pieces a challenge.\n\nThe Main Object of the game is to retrieve each Piece of the "Device" that was destroyed in the "Experiment" (some backstory here wouldn't go amiss) and return them to the standing stones on the centre island. Each piece is guarded by at least two or more robots and can vary in size from tiny pieces that barely take up any room to giant parts of the device that need prior planning and inventory space to take back to the standing stones. Once all of the pieces have been collected the game ends. As time passes and pieces are returned, more robots appear, in greater numbers and variety, making each piece harder and harder to collect.\n\nThe Inventory system is tile based, so that certain items take up more room than others. A Flask of Luke Warm Tea only takes up 2 tiles but the Largest Piece of the Device takes up 16 tiles all together. Looting houses, fallen enemies and occasionally bins and phoneboxes mean that your inventory will stack up with all kinds of good loot, making you consider whether you want those extra shotgun shells or that canned pie that might be needed later.\n\nAll in All, I enjoy this game immensely and hope that Big Robot continue to add fresh content to this already wonderful concoction of a game.\n\nEDIT: Props to the Devs for allowing you to play as a Madam!","August 20, 2014","true","35.3"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","17","24","2","0"

It's worth the time I put into it, just don't expect to get more than 4-5 hours out of it.

It ends up being a needle in a haystack senario and I spent most of my time sprinting around the island in circles just trying to find the tiny little stones.

The art style is dark and gloomy and there's some suspense to be had in hiding, but it also tries to be funny which takes any of the suspense that was there away. Don't get me wrong, I applaud the devlopers for trying to be unique, but it isn't very well executed.\n\nThe game is focused on replayability and when you are generating the world, you can choose the biome types of the five islands. However, there's really no difference in each of these biomes and they're merely for looks(No new threats per island). There's really nothing new or any reason to replay the game.\n\nAlso, for a game that cites itself as survival, I've found it harder to die than to live.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cancelHoo/recommended/242880/","cancelHoo","cancelHoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cancelHoo/","616 products in account","This is a re-review of this game post-release. I don't usually write reviews of games, but I felt compelled to write this in response to some of the fair yet slightly misleading user reviews I see on the front page.\n\n** THE PROBLEM WITH USER REVIEWS **\n\nFirstly, I don't like steam's user review system. I have no idea how to fix it either. The problem is apparent with games like this, which have some legit criticisms from some gamers, but others would find it immensely enjoyable. The button that "upvotes" reviews is labelled "helpful", but I do believe that a bad review can be helpful without my holding the same opinion. On top of that, it seems that people with a lot of review "helpfuls" have a large group of friends or are in guilds, etc. I am not criticizing anyone...just a flawed system that might lead people away from a niche game that many would enjoy.\n\n** GAMEPLAY **\n\nIn fiction, there is a thing called a trope. A trope is a often used device, such as a fallen hero or a damsel in distress. These things can be over used, and genre fiction has a habit of creating whole works based on them. The point of a trope is to use something people are comfortable with so that they can spend their efforts enjoying the important bits...like characterization, or sometimes a fresh look at an old trope. Tropes are a creators shorthand because wholly new things are dense and difficult. The greatest works of literature and film use tropes, some creating new tropes, so that they aren't over long and dull.\n\nThe gameplay in this game is the trope. It is resource management, fetch quests and stealth. While the game is not quite a survival horror game, it uses the same limitations for an effect that I will get into in the next section. There are games which expand what a game can do...some successful, some not. This is not one of those games, nor does it try to be. You will understand what is expected from you early on and you will be doing it a lot. I would like to point out that the combat in this game can be easy for some, but I would contend that this game is not about hammering through with a weapon and those people who do are missing the point.\n\n** MOOD **\n\nThis is where this game shines. Back in the 1960's, some folks at a small British movie company decided to remake an old classic film, Dracula. By that time everyone had seen the original Bela Lugosi film, so really what is the point in remaking a film when everyone already knows the plot? The answer is mood. Hammer films are not gory in the way contemporary films are, they are not jump scary, they ooze creepy. There is something of the molester in Cristopher Lee's performance in Dracula: Prince of Darkness, something that is in the original text, but sadly missing in Bela Lugosi's self-indulgent performance. And yet, Hammer films always have a wit. It is a mood that had never been reproduced in gaming...until now.\n\nI roleplay this game. What I mean is that it might be possible to manhandle the robots, but I refuse to try because I let the mood sink in. I am more quick to run from the dogs than wisely set a trap for them. Not because I am a bad gamer, but because I let myself get into the environment. In sucking at this game I heighten my enjoyment of it. Winning is not the point of a game like this, experiencing it is. Ultimately, Dracula gets a stake in the heart, the end. This could have happened on page one, but it didn't.\n\n** STORY **\n\nThere isn't one, and thank god for that. I am so sick of game makers thinking they are novelists because they largely suck at it. With some exceptions, almost all being in the adventure game category (I hated Bioshock Infinite,) good stories in games are second rate rehashes of better novels or movies. If I want character development or a solid plot I will read a book. If you don't read books and need videogames to get some narrative, well then please don't breed.\n\nThat isn't to say there isn't a narrative. There is, but it is one that I felt I was creating myself. Gone are the overwrought cgi cutscenes. Gone are the "easter egg hunt" notes on why we are here. What you have is a series of islands, some evil robots, and an attempt at surviving impossible odds.\n\n** CONCLUSION **\n\nThis game isn't for everyone. Anyone who reads the negative reviews should take them to heart. But I am aware that people will see the number of "helpfuls" and think that is a vindication of their opinion, rather than what it says...it is helpful. I greatly enjoyed this game for the mood and emotive character of the world and level design. I had no problem jumping through the fake hoops required to spend some time within. But fake hoops they are. If you want an original experience, a successful experiment, check this one out.","September 23, 2013","true","19.6"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","2"

Not much of a complicated game, you don't have about 100 different weapons that all do a slightly higher amount of damage like other games survival games I've played, instead you have at least 4 different guns and a hatchet (it takes place around the 1800s is what I think). You can develope some strategies to win the game faster (I try a different one each time I create a new world) and you can make the AI harder each time you create a new world. There are some other items that lurer away robots from a piece or in a town. Combat isn't much, although you can get into gun fights or attacked by a calvary, but its still fun to ambush a hunting party.\nThe visibillity system needs to be improved (sometimes when it says that you can't be seen at all you can get spotted by the robots) and it is cloudy from what I see. It's not much of a horror game for me (although it is creepy when it changes to night or when a bird flies next to you, and sometimes when you hear robots near you)\nFor multiplayer: It is fun to play with other people. However, there is some flaws. For example: Pvp is unfair when a player has an axe and spawn kills another. You only start out with a Bandage and Tea (or sherry). By the time you get on the server thats been going on for at least five minutes, someone already has most of the pieces and nearly the whole island has been looted. You can at least talk to players and compromise with them, you can also make it co-opertive gameplay wise.\nAlthough some impprovements need to be made to the gameplay, I honestly think its a good game. 9/10","April 25, 2015","true","16.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The entire time you are constantly on edge, trying to survive and make tactical choices throughout the entire game (day and night cycles are equally nerve-inducing). All the enemies, items, weapons and encounters are unique, and the game gets harder as you progress towards successfully escaping the five inter-connected islands. Stealth is key to this game. If you do not like taking your time or being stealthy, then this game WILL punish you; you will find yourself running away from enemies or dying most of the time as a result.\n\nDespite a few personal issues I had with the lighting and game mechanics (mainly item usage like the alarm clock or bottle), I believe this game was a quick, fun, and overall entertaining way to spend an evening. I was able to finish a complete game in a single day that lasted a little over three hours. Just know that those were very worthwhile hours though. To me, there is not too much immediate replay value, but I can see myself coming back to this game some future afternoon. There is also a multiplayer option outside of the single-player gameplay, but I cannot comment on this since I have yet to have friends willing to play it with me.\n\nBasically, I know this game won't be for everyone, but it is a solid stealth-based game. Therefore, pick it up during a steam sale when you get the chance! Also, due to its relatively short single player, if you do not like it within the first hour or so, you can always get your money back from Steam. I hope this review helps you in making your decision to buy this game or not, but if you have any questions about the game before you purchase it, feel free to add me or leave a comment here about it.\n\nOh yeah, my final rating (as people find this to be almost a necessity):\nThis game gets 7 crumpets split between 10 bad sets of teeth.

So he scrounges through peoples' houses to find hisself some tea and crampets, so he can shove them down his crumpethole like a true gentleman would.\nThis determination to remain a gentlemansir even on a godforsaken island filled with angry native robots that say stupid vaguely aristocratic things to each other is an unparalleled look at the human condition at its very finest, the unbudging will to remain true to ourselves.

And let me tell you, I've seen this guy's drunken stumbling many times already. True story, alcohol makes you high, yay for sir.\nThis game, if I were to compare it to other games, is like pokemon.

I think It lacks depth and variety.\n\nYour first and only objective is to find pieces of the mysterious machine that can take you home if fixed. That’s what you’ll be doing for the rest of the game.\n\nStealth\nSo, you approach a piece and see that it’s guarded by a couple of robots with guns. You can throw an empty bottle or a rock to the side, the robots will leave to investigate the noise, you safely grab the piece and leg it. It doesn’t matter if they see you: they can’t run nearly as fast as you or shoot straight. Even if they hit you, it still doesn’t matter—your health regenerates over time and their guns don’t do much damage from a distance. The old bottle trick will help you get the first fragments, but, the thing is, it’ll work just as perfectly for the very last fragment on the last island. There are other tools you can use to distract or fight the enemy, but why bother if bottle throwing works every time? At later stages of the game some tougher enemies will appear. They never seem to approach the fragment sites. You have no reason to disturb or confront them, so I’m not sure how tough most of them really are.\n\nSurvival\nYou need food to regenerate health, but it is abundant. I only ran out once, and that was at the very end of the game when I already had all the fragments. Sure, it’s neat that you can hunt and cook the game you’ve just shot, but you can easily get by with whatever you find laying around.\n\nStory\nThe intro is intriguing. How did you get there? Who built the device and what does it really do? What was the experiment all about? How did it go wrong? Who’s the man helping you? Why do the robots hunt you, and why do they seem to control the area? Where did all the humans go? What’s with the will-o’-the-wisp things and what do they have to do with the device? Sadly, I didn’t get closer to finding answers to any of these questions when I got to the end. Even the ending cutscene just shows the machine starting and then cuts to credits.\n\nAll in all, I guess it was interesting enough for one playthrough (took me roughly 4.5 hours), but I don’t think I’ll be getting back to it unless there’s a patch that makes survival harder or expands the story greatly.\n\nMany thanks to AvantGuard for gifting me this game.","August 11, 2014","false","5.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Not only can you customize the islands but you can customize the difficulty by adjusting how many of each type of robot spawn in at different times in the game, hell you can make it to where there are no robots at all.There are tedious things about this game such as the inventory management, i mean sure i get it, its used to add strategy and planning. but you cant even rotate items and your inventory space is way too small! The game also gets repetative and boring after a while with not alot of replayability. I'd give this game a 6.5/10","August 15, 2014","true","15.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Or it explodes and alerts every robot on the island to turn you into swiss cheese. EIther way, I haven't found out yet.\n\nAnother great part of the game is the survival aspect. You must always have food to survive. I don't mean a Dead Rat or some gross spuds either. I mean you must always have GOOD food, or in the game's case a lot of whiskey, otherwise you're living on a timer until your Vitality and Health runs out, killing you.\n\nOne the the best things is the stealth required in the game. You can't run up to a group of robots later on in the game, otherwise you're asking to get loaded with buckshot. You must sneak up to them, distract them, or my favorite, use a ManTrap on them, which is simply a beartrap reinvented to hunt you. Also, pay attention to your visibility. Robots can spot you from just looking at you so it's best to crouch when they're near and to get a rock or some other cover between you and your hunters.\n\nOverall, this game is great and has a lot of replayabilty considering you can tweak the world generation and the amount of robots. I also think this game would be great if they had more survival features and it was a challenge to survive without the robots.\n\n10/10","June 26, 2014","true","5.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It’s one of two games I wanted to play just on the strength of a preview video, the other was TF2. I guess that means I like solid gameplay dressed with quirky character and environment designs.\n\nIt’s a stealth game where the odds will be increasingly stacked against you as the game progresses, and there is no quick save (though there are save points). In other words it doesn’t spoon feed you or hold your hand.\n\nThe only edge you have is being able to run much faster than most of your potential pursuers and good cammoflage. Any other edges you may feel you require, you will have to chisel out yourself with your fingernails.\n\nThe AI is well coded, plan badly and you will be chased for zig-zagging miles while you try to throw your pursuer and keep your health intact. You can aslo try to induce the AI to fight amongst itself a lot of fun if it works.\n\nSo to summarise I'm not even going to qualify with "for an indie game" when I say this is a great game, but rather it's a great game full stop.","June 30, 2014","true","42.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It serves its quirky premise completely in that it provides a highly replayable, tension-filled, atmospheric game of hide and seek with English robots. It's like being thrown into the story The Most Dangerous Game with a steampunk twist. The idea is so unique and interesting that it, alone, could probably carry a game of mediocre quality, but Sir, You Are Being Hunted is far more than that. With the procedurally generated world, the high difficulty, different player characters, multiplayer option, variability in robot hunters, situational synth music tracks, and wonderful atmosphere, this game is an experience.\n\nThe graphics are excellent, with each island type providing new and immersive topography that will challenge the player to scurry through various landscapes such as swampy underbrush, industrial complexes, broken castle walls, Victorian England towns, barren forests, and seaside cliffs. In addition, the islands are not small, and provide quite an exploratory challenge when scavenging for equipment and device pieces. The player can modify and select which settings each island will be generated with, what type of robots will be in play, and several other factors that all work to set the stage for the player to take the lead role of the hunted. Replayability is maximized, and while each game will see the player doing similar scavenging and hunting for pieces, the world will look completely different each playthrough. It should also be mentioned that the playthrough of this game, especially your first playthrough, depending on how stealthy and skilled you are, will take upwards of six to eight hours.\n\nI also need to address the 'feel' of the game. The attention to detail is wonderful, with the old world coming alive in each of the brick walls, open marshy fields, leafless woods, and small towns and rolling fields. When you find yourself fleeing from several robot hunters, sprinting across an open field which is slowly being blanketed by the rising moon and its hollow light and see the silhouette of hot air balloon casting its search light into the very forest you're fleeing into you will know what it is I'm attempting to describe. The shadow of the sunset on walls, the lively wildlife scurrying in the underbrush and flying in formation in the evening sky, all cooperate to create a lush and living background in which you find yourself navigating in order to survive, and it's not easy.\n\nThe robots have lives of their own, with each different type bringing its own approach to finding and attacking you. The most common of which is the typical rifle toting hunter, and which you will find alone, and in large groups wandering through fields, often accompanied by hunting dogs. There are mounted hunters, large pistol-toting overseers of the towns, hot-air balloons with massive search lights, frightening scarecrow alarms, and a large walker that bleats out the strangest and most terrifying sounds in the game. The variety in hunters, combined with that attention to detail in the setting creates such an interesting and immersive quality that you'll go from feeling confident in your ability to creep around to suddenly finding yourself hiding desperately from large groups that, if they find you, will certainly kill you. For those who are aware of it, another game that provides a similar feel is Monstrum, which is one of my favorites. The feeling of helplessness as you flee from your enemies heightens the tension to palpable levels. In one recent game I found myself setting up a perfect distraction to extract a piece from two guards and a hunting dog, only to grab the piece and flee swiftly into an open field where several mounted robots were doing flybys, looking for me. The intensity just doesn't stop, and actually increases as you find more and more pieces of the device.\n\nThis leads me to my only real critique, and it's not a critique, but a warning to people who may be interested in this game. It is hard. Very hard. Playing recklessly will get you killed again, and again. It's far more Metal Gear than it is Doom, and you'll need to play like it. I'd actually find it an interesting challenge to attempt to complete the game without actually killing any of the robots. The major reason that it's so difficult is that the save points, of which there are five, are the only areas of the game that you can actually save your progress. If you don't save at one of these five points and die then you lose all progress since your last save. This can, and will be, brutal. You are going to be hunted and killed repeatedly until you finall get a feel for how to move around and survive, and even then you will die. Some players may be turned off by the difficult, so be warned, though if you like that sounds fun and challenging, then this is your game.\n\nIf you're a fan of pure first person shooters, huge gunfights, and looking for pure and raw action, you may want to look elsewhere. For those who like games of this nature, where you enjoy atmosphere, tension, and struggling to survive in a world where everything wants you dead, then this is your game. I can't recommend it enough for that particular audience.","April 18","true","32.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But it's slightly below the bar over which I'd recommend it - especially at full price.\n\nThe thing is: for the first few minutes while it's a novelty it's hilarious. But soon enough you'll start to find the problems. For example, there's no story, no background, no nothing. You're just "there" and need to collect a few things that don't make sense.\n\nBut ok, I can live with that. However, for single player the biggest letdown is replayability: There's none. Sure it's a procedural world but it's plain and boring. So once you've seen one you've seen it all.\n\nMultiplayer could really save this game. That's where I've spent most of my playing time. It's fun, until you realize all the shortcuts that have been done and how much more simple the game is compared to single player. The MP is fun but it feels completely unfinished. And from what I remember it really is.\n\nSo what puts the last nail on the coffin is that it isn't in development any more. I was enthusiastic about this game while it was being developed. When MP came out the devs said they'd improve it. This never happened apart from a couple of bug fixes... Until they apparently said "meh, good enough" and left it at that.\n\nIt's a sad state of affairs but unfortunately one in which many good ideas get buried.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you like playing something "different" with a "peculiar sense of humour" then this may be for you. Grab it on a strong sale. If you can get a 4-pack for little money it's also worth gifting to some friends and play some MP for an hour or two worth of laughs. Most of the fun goes away after the novelty wears out though.","May 31","false","6.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The island is rather barren and dull with tonnes of props and houses heavily reused (you can obviously see the pattern). The island is plagued with robots that are constantly on the lookout for you. There seem to be multiple type of bots including a hot air baloon and dogs but really they don't make much difference.\n\nWeapons and ammos are scarce but trust me it really don't make much of a different. You may need to travel to other island via boat to look for more parts but those island just seemed rather similar to me. I joined a multiplayer (you don't actually get to interact with other players) game where all places have been scavanged with only 1 cloth and 1 drink in my inventory with 2 more parts to collect. One of this part is guarded by 2 hunter and a dog. I practically waltz in crouching, pick the part and ran off without taking damage (yes they spotted me but I just ran). That is how bad the A.I. is.\n\nAfter 5 minutes into the game I've already seen everything the game has to offer and got really bored because actions occured too little and the game is just plain dull with the pace set.\n\nIf you are really into games like these, this can be decent for you with no visible bugs or even hiccups and the multiplayer seem to have dedicated server (in EU) but with 200+ ping I can still play smoothly; otherwise steer clear (I had to leave this game overnight to collect the trading cards since I spent 5 hours into the game and not a single drop).","December 18, 2015","false","12.0"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","16","28","2","0"

It turned out to be better than I expected!  The atmosphere is fantastic and it really does feel like Britain especially on a dark drizzly night, crouching in the woods with the moon shining down above you.\n\nWhile it's definitely not Amnesia (and doesn't try to be), the robots can be genuinely scary, especially when you hear the slow thud of the Landowner bearing down on you.  Which brings me to maybe the best bit about this game - the sound.  It really evokes a dark, 'tweedpunk' future filled with menace.  The first you'll know of the robots is when you suddenly hear their whirring and clanking from behind a hill.  They also come out with some humorous phrases ("I blame the foreigners").\n\nThe AI seems pretty good, and the robots will sometimes erupt into firefights amongst themselves, giving you even more ways to outwit them.\n\nThis is a game you need to use your mind for as the sandbox environment (and 'British Countryside Generator') provide a pretty much infinite number of situations you can find yourself in.  If you like sandbox games and sneaking games, this is definitely for you.\n\nWhile this game is very nicely designed from an artistic point of view, the textures can look very plain close up.  I was surprised to learn that the engine used in this game is the same as the one used in The Forest.  However, this really does not detract from gameplay at all, and I especially love the effect of the sun's rays shining through woodland at sunrise and sunset.  It also means that the game is well optimised for slower systems.\n\nDownsides?  If you want a comprehensive survival experience this isn't it.  You can hunt for food and cook it and so forth, but it's not worth it.  You can keep your 'Vitality' topped up by munching on blackberries and drinking tea every now and then and that's really all there is to it.  There's no system of shelter, sleeping or crafting so it's nothing like as deep as other 'survival' games out there such as Rust and The Forest.  It's a 'shallow' survival game, which to be honest is all it professes to be.\n\nApproach this game with an open mind as there is really nothing else like it out there.  It is still being patched currently and I think multiplayer support is still to be added.  It's certainly well worth the asking price and I look forward to seeing what Big Robot can make next.\n\n8/10","July 14, 2014","true","8.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It was updated once a month with lots of bug fixes and content.\nNow its close to release and its better than ever!\n\nThis is a fun, challenging and scary survival game. You have an open world of 5 islands to explore and the objective is to find pices of fragments that will help you get out of there. Around each island there are robots roaming/guarding villages and the fragment locations. You can sneak past them, distract them and/or ambush them with different traps and weapons.\n\nThe stealth system is great and there is a good viarity among the robots, Normal guards with shotguns, dogs, flying patrol units, cavalry, scarecrow, land owner and a few more that i dont want to spoil. (some of them are really creepy)\n\nThe story is pretty cool, its nothing special but its not bad.\n\nIs this worth you money?\nIf you like a challenging game where it will take you some time to learn what to do and how to do it, if you are playing for the survival feeling, not the Call of duty "run and gun" gameplay.. this is a game for you.\n\nIts not officially released yet, but for me its a solid 8/10.\nWhen the Multiplayer arrives i will update the review.\n\nEDIT: Its now released and its awesome! 9/10","April 23, 2014","true","6.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Or when you sneak through the forest and then for the first time you hear the landkeeper's scream and you open up your inventory and rather drink up all the brew pretending it will make it go away...\nAnother funny factor was when robots started to fight each other.

Sir you are being hunted is a british horror survival game. There are many mechanics in the game well, for an alpha. In this game you must search, kill, hide, run, and escape. You must use strategy through out the whole game, which requires alot of skill. There are 4 biomes: Rural, (I may have spelled that wrong) Fens, Mountains, and industrial. If you have no idea what Rural and Fens mean, dont worry i dont either (or im just bad with british words). Rural is a normal type island, Industrail has alot of houses and buildings, (which means alot more hunters) Fens well... i honestly have no idea because i dont go to Fens often, Mountains... you should be able to figure it out (alot of mountains and buildings are scarce). Stealth is a HUGE part in the game, even if you have loads of ammo and guns. You would never be able to just kill your way through everything. The HUD is pretty good, it shows what wepon you have, health, vitality, and even a visibilty meter, no joke, there is actully a visibility meter. Not much enemys at the moment, but there is the Hunter,(normal robot with a duble barreled shotgun) Mayor, (a robot that protects the town and only shoots you if something was recently stolen from any houses nearby, and shoots you with a revolver) Dog, (can see you alot easier and pins you down so the owner can shoot you) Stray dog, (runs around and randomly pins you from time to time) Scarecrow, (as scary as slenderman) poacher, (has a blunderbuss and lays traps in forests and is only found in forests) Sea monster, (bassicly, just dont go in water) and the balloon (flys around in the air with a spotlight, walking in to the spotlight will cause an alarm to go off and spoiling your position. This game is also very creppy. There is only a few wepon, duble barreled shotgun, revolver, hachet, rifle, blunderbuss. each has thier on purpuse.

I'm British and no longer living in the UK so this game does a good job of making me feel at home. It is very quirky, has a tinge of black comedy about it and is very British, however...\n\nThis is one of those games where you have to spend alot of time playing it... dying repeatedly, starting again, rinse and repeat trying to do a little better each time. While alot of players are into this, I am not one of them and instead favor games with progression.\n\nI will say that it's very hard because your character needs to eat every 10 minutes and the amount of food in any given game won't be able to fill a saucer, let alone your belly. Not only do you have hunger to contend with but also robots with insanely good aim which all seem to huddle around the objects that you need to collect to progress. Killing them really isn't an option as there are usually so many around at any given time and distracting them works for only a few seconds and they WILL spot you before you are able to grab the object and hide.\n\nI dunno just feels like it could do with some more work maybe some tweaking. The general gameplay as is right now, is basically: Start game, find one fragment (the objectives) get hungry, spend ages trying to look for food before going for another fragment which is heavily guarded. Try to kill/distract them, fail and end up sprinting away while getting shot at as if you were caught with the farmers daughter. If you survive, hand the fragment in and then eventually end up starving to death or running out of bandages/ammo/distractions very quickly.\n\nI know alot of people are into this masochistic kind of gameplay but I like to relax and enjoy a game. If you are like me then you should avoid this game, if you like the sound of what I described or you like to play RPGs on "hardcore mode" you'll probably love it.\n\nOh and despite the bragging there is neither tea nor biscuits.

Second, and more complicated, is that procedurally-generated games always make me feel like I’ve seen pretty much everything I’m likely to see, far earlier than their promise of endless variations might suggest. While the environments are never identical, variations that feel significantly different are fairly rare, and the nature of procedural generation means you’ll mostly see stuff that falls within a certain band of stuff that looks much the same.

I haven't quite looked into much on the robots themselves, but I find that the immersion comes from wondering just what the robots are and observing their behaviors. Trying to stay hidden can be somewhat of a chore, but I find that it takes some amount of practice to be able to successfully sneak or confront robots and remain alive. Building your inventory is less "what if" and more "this is what I need right now". Some weapons and items are outright useless (I've had no luck using bear traps at all.

I haven't quite looked into much on the robots themselves, but I find that the immersion comes from wondering just what the robots are and observing their behaviors. Trying to stay hidden can be somewhat of a chore, but I find that it takes some amount of practice to be able to successfully sneak or confront robots and remain alive. Building your inventory is less "what if" and more "this is what I need right now". Some weapons and items are outright useless (I've had no luck using bear traps at all.

The stealth is insanely realistic and you are forced to stay hidden in shadows, vegetation and below topographical features. The sound of a robot is distressing and you need to turn on your hyper perception to see and hear them before they see you. Sometimes, a gun fight is unavoidable, the best cover with fast thinking and reactions are needed when a robot lifts his gun in your direction. Stressful decisions must be made all the time; fight or flight, stealth or rush, stop bleeding or keep running, rush or stealth. There are many different types of robots after you and jump scares should be expected frequently. On top of the action and stealth, there is breathe taking scenery, 5 very different biomes and the world is always changing weather and time of day.\n\nI personally find this game hard to play due to all the stress it gives me but it's certainly rewarding. I have yet to play this game properly due to lost progress in previous updates. The developers have not added more content in a long time due to some networking issues of a multiplayer update. They are planning to release the multiplayer update early next year and I'm highly anticipating coop with friends. As a result, the game is still a bit barren like a beta but it should get more content and details in the future. Even though a great deal of improvement of a great game can be expected in the future give some thought about getting this game now to support the great indie developers.\n","November 23, 2014","true","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The atmosphere and tension the game creates makes you think twice before you try and loot a house or steal a fragment and this is what makes it unique. It manages to create an atmosphere which many othe games are unable o achieve. The graphical design is almost perfect even if the graphics them selves are no so good.

White in color, but with tinges of green with mold, and also black from fires. My heart was pounding. My stomach was growling. A thousand thoughts racing through my mind as I saw a fire pit. My stomach told me to cook some food over it, but my mind told me not to draw attention to myself with smoke. I walked around the property, slowly checking around corners to see if a mustachioed robot gentleman would be there waiting for me. But alas, none were spotted. I carefully tiptoed back to the fire pit to cook food to appease my rumbling stomach. I took the matches and lit the fire.\n"*VRRP* WHAT'S THAT? *CLANK*"\nA robot was indeed near me. I quickly threw a rock over his head hoping he would be distracted, but he was not. His sights were aimed at me, and his only concern was that I was still breathing. I drew my revolver and fired off two shots. I still don't know if either hit their target because immediately afterward, I turned around and began running through the gap in the charred walls.\nI spotted a tree and immediately ran behind it. I could hear two robots now. Their clanging joints sounded like the bells ringing to mark the time of my death. I stepped from behind the tree and fired three bullets into the iron torso of one. I then felt a hot, stinging pain in my side. I'd been shot. The other robot was rushing toward me to avenge his fallen comrade. I knew i only had one bullet left. I darted from behind the tree and pulled the trigger.\nThe bullet rang true! The hot lead surged through the metallic skull cavity of the machine that was hunting me. I was safe!\nOr was I?\nI was surrounded by the sounds of beeps and whirs and clanks and I soon saw that four new robotic foes were upon me. I put my revolver in its holster and began running. Hot lead flew past me and all around me as i sprinted away from my pursuers. I came to another set of houses, but this was no time to stop and loot. Those robots meant business. Their bullets still whizzing past me, I ran through the houses into the rocky hills by the ocean.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/5NATCH/recommended/242880/","5NATCH","mmm!5NATCH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/5NATCH/","513 products in account","A thrilling FPS experience which provides plenty of action, challenging gameplay and growing suspense as you progress.\n\nYou Sir (Or Madam), begin your adventure by spawning next to the standing stones. Unsure of what's happened, A voice explains to you that you need to collect some stones and return them back to where you are currently standing.\n\nThe problem facing the player is that these stones have been scattered randomly across the world and they are all well guarded by some deadly robot hunters. There isn't much explanation on why or how the robots got here, but one thing players learn very quickly when playing this game is that these robots only want you dead.\n\nA world is made up of five islands: the centre is where you begin and has islands connected north, south, east and west. While the world is randomly generated at the start of the game, you can choose to have each island stick to a theme or bio dome and there are a few different bio domes to select from.\n\nSome bio domes available are simple rural areas which provide plenty of long grass, bushes and some villages. Old Crumbling castles, Stone work and Tall Churches and my favourite The Industrial Bio Dome. Gloomy skies, Brick Mills and Huge abandoned factories.\n\nThe enviroments are well detailed, you wont see any bright and happy skies as the usual weather forecase is often overcast and cloudly. Accompanied by dark surroundings that constrast with a world of no electricty. However the coloured clouds by the sunset or sunrise in the mornings can often leave some incredible wallpaper worthy like pictures but they also enhance the feeling of being alone in the wilderness.\n\nAnd while you may feel alone, There's always something out there to remind you that you're not.\n\nThe Robots have many different forms. Your average hunter robot smokes a pipe, carrys a rifle and looks left and right, while patroling his area. They will talk to other robots in their strange robotic voice, sometimes you can work out what they're saying too and its funny.\n\nEarly on the robots are found walking through the area, and you can always expect them to be near some fragements of the stones you are trying to collect. If you manage to snatch one  of them and return it back to the standing stones where you spawned, You'll be a step closer to winning the game, but more advanced robots appear...\n\nshould you set one of these bots off They'll aim to chase you and find a good range to shoot you. Be aware, It will not take them long to take you down. The early robots may appear to be dumb for a while but 3 or 4 shots and you're dead.\n\nIt's also worth noting that taking damage you risk a chance to bleed, if you dont treat the wound asap you could possibly bleed out and eventually die very quickly. The sense of panic while trying to apply a bandage as well as having a robot chase you for a better shot is fun in its own way\n\nBleeding? Bandages? You'll need to carry some for a lot of 'just in case' scenarios so players will need to plunder houses, buildings and anything else that may contain loot. Because while you're looking for ammo for guns, tools to distract the robots or first aid. You'll need to look after you're vitality meter too. Fortunately this isn't too hard to look after, Simply keep this meter high up and you'll heal  and have energy to run and jump. you'll start by eating dead rats, old eggs and maybe even cat food but over time you'll find more healthier things to maintain good vitality.\n\nBy the way, Try the mushrooms...\n\nThe best part of this game is the sense of flight or fight.\nSure you might have loads of ammo and you're good shot with your gun, but opening fire may alert robots near by and draw them closer. The other idea is using traps and devices to distract robots so you can walk past, loot a certain building or even take one of those special rocks to win the game. Ammo doesn't show up very often, so you will need to find alternatives to deal with robots if they stand in your way without drawing attention to yourself or resorting to violence.\n\nSir, you are being hunted provides many great moments where you will enjoy outwitting the robots for your own gain and frantic moments running like a fugitive and never looking behind you because it means death. The Vitality system makes the player remember the on going need for surivial but it isn't too difficult or complex and the variety of enemy robots deliver different types of AI and behaviour, they can be hilarious at times but in the right scenarios can be intimidating and sometimes even scary.\n\nI'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys FPS and enjoys the whole stealth approach and having their brains tested, Also use headphones with surround sound for the best experince.","January 21, 2015","true","15.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not because its dark or the enemies have their intestines hanging out, but because of the amazing sense of apprehension and fear it manages to build with minimal sound or graphic complexity. There is something about being hunted by robots with guns, horses and dogs that makes you feel powerless and weak. However, this is probably the game's negative too: it can be quite frustrating when you have 2 shotgun ammo, a rock and alcohol to survive 10 robots (this happens often later on if you're not stealthy). I would like to see mod support added (not sure if it is possible with Unity), some more biome options (there are greyed out "edit" buttons so I assume its coming) and maybe customisable difficulty (like robot spawn rates, robot health, accuracy, and senses). Overall, this Early Access game has to be one of the best on the system. It has tension, 19th century guns and plenty of British accents.

It's quirky name and decidedly tongue-in-cheek "maximum Britishness" approach made me think it was going to be too much gimmick and not enough game.  I am happy to say that was not the case.  SYABH (what an acronym) is a solid game that perfectly captures the appeal of the stealth FPS genre, but with its own unique ambiance and the added boon of high replayability thanks to random map generation.\n\nTo be more specific about the gameplay, SYABH seems to combine a lot of elements from other stealth (or stealth-optional) shooters into one attractive result.  Combat plays out a bit like Deus Ex, of all things: crouching is the key to being unobserved, enemies won't detect you if you're not in line of sight, and sometimes the best choice in combat is to simply leg it.  Inventory management is also a bit like Deus Ex, certainly with the grid-based "you have X slots" system, but the use and variety of items is more reminescent of S.T.A.L.K.E.R., especially with the game's focus on looting and storage.  S.T.A.L.K.E.R. also comes to mind with the game's health and vitality (read: food) system, along with the possibility of bleeding from injuries and the necessity to stop said bleeding with bandages.\n\nAs for the ambiance, it's very tongue-in-cheek humorous while also retaining that real sense of danger and, dare I say it, horror at times.  Some enemies can and do strike fear into your heart if you see them under the wrong circumstances, which in this game is more often than not.  Above all though this game is very, very British.  The robots look British, say British things, and act British.  I once caught a hunting party stopping mid-field to have tea before continuing on.  It's the little touches that make this game charming, some of which I'm sure I'm missing because I'm not British myself.\n\nDifficulty wise, I've found this game pretty decent.  Early on the game is easy for anyone experienced with stealth combat, particularly for Deus Ex players.  The basic robot variant is fairly easy to take on in combat if you're sneaky, and will even reliably miss you at close range so long as you're circle-strafing.  Once more variants start showing up though, or even simply start appearing in more numbers, things definitely get more challenging.  Certain combinations and/or numbers of enemies are definite "run away only" situations no matter how much firepower you've managed to scavenge, and just sprinting across the landscape in the hopes that you won't get shot too much simply won't work anymore.  You have to think, observe, and plan in order to make it to the end of the game, picking your battles where you can.  It's a reasonable difficulty ramp, and one you can tackle more or less at your own pace, since it seems to be tied to how much of the game's central fetch quest you've completed.\n\nOverall, Sir, You Are Being Hunted is an enjoyable game that manages to amuse in one second and induce very real tension and even a touch of fear in the next.  Anyone who likes the sort of stealthy resource-reliant looting-with-optional-combat type gameplay seen in S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Deus Ex, and countless other titles will find that same part of their game brain satified by this, and the randomized and adjustable nature of the game makes it highly replayable.  If that sounds like your kind of game, then it's well worth the modest asking price.","June 30, 2014","true","22.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Everywhere the robotic voices of your pursuers pierce the silence, and hearing the thumping and screams of the Landowner approaching is a truly terrifying thing.\n\nI highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a stealth/horror game which at times leaves you with heart beating, running like mad through the woods with crazy robots in pursuit.","April 13, 2014","true","19.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Definitely for those that enjoy a bit of heavy stealth along with running for your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ life!\n\nDifficulty curve was quite steep at first. You will have to come to your own realization how to best handle every different encounter with your hunting adversaries. Hunters will be the most often encountered, I highly reccommend not engaging any group of three or more unless its late game and you have the very rare rifle with ammunition to spare. Far more often than not, discretion will be the better part of valor, think about the reward versus the risk. You can only save at the center of the beginning island and any boat dock.  They have unlimted units while you have.. well, admittedly unlimiited lives. But hey! You probably want the best ending score right?!\n\nWith the axe, if you're lucky enough to find one, you can circle strafe around one or two hunters until you hear them let off both barrels with their shotgun, then quickly close straight in for the kill! Don't let them backpedal, sprint. Make sure to check your surroundings, might be that a hunting party or two heard the shots and are now zeroing in on your position. If its safe, then loot them ♥♥♥♥♥es for a possibly working shotgun and bonus items. Traps are one of the best items in the game, learn to use them!\n\nHonestly wouldn't bother with poachers at all. I killed a few when they first showed up but their blunderbuss, while insanely powerful at close range, seemed unnecessary seeing as how a single shot required a 2x1 space in your inventory. And basically underperformed with dynamite which seemed far more worth carrying for tough enemies, as in squires or horse riders, or groups of softies guarding fragments.\n\n\n\n","October 18, 2015","true","17.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Definitely for those that enjoy a bit of heavy stealth along with running for your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ life!\n\nDifficulty curve was quite steep at first. You will have to come to your own realization how to best handle every different encounter with your hunting adversaries. Hunters will be the most often encountered, I highly reccommend not engaging any group of three or more unless its late game and you have the very rare rifle with ammunition to spare. Far more often than not, discretion will be the better part of valor, think about the reward versus the risk. You can only save at the center of the beginning island and any boat dock.  They have unlimted units while you have.. well, admittedly unlimiited lives. But hey! You probably want the best ending score right?!\n\nWith the axe, if you're lucky enough to find one, you can circle strafe around one or two hunters until you hear them let off both barrels with their shotgun, then quickly close straight in for the kill! Don't let them backpedal, sprint. Make sure to check your surroundings, might be that a hunting party or two heard the shots and are now zeroing in on your position. If its safe, then loot them ♥♥♥♥♥es for a possibly working shotgun and bonus items. Traps are one of the best items in the game, learn to use them!\n\nHonestly wouldn't bother with poachers at all. I killed a few when they first showed up but their blunderbuss, while insanely powerful at close range, seemed unnecessary seeing as how a single shot required a 2x1 space in your inventory. And basically underperformed with dynamite which seemed far more worth carrying for tough enemies, as in squires or horse riders, or groups of softies guarding fragments.\n\n\n\n","October 18, 2015","true","17.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

As I slowly progressed in salvaging the remaining fragments I noticed that exotic enemies spawned more frequently around the islands. Despite this, I was never caught off-guard and I was never shot at by Robots that I hadn't spotted before. Once I collected my last fragment I made my way into a wheat field to escape the gaze of two patrolling robots. One Landowner and two hounds later, I came across a shadowy figure standing motionless in the middle of the field. There was no marker above it so I assumed that it was either a static prop or a barrel of some kind. As I came closer, I noticed a small drape hanging off the side, moving gently with the wind. Brandishing my Axe, I inched closer with the intention of satisfying my insatiable curiosity. In an instant, the shadowy figure snapped into my direction, staring straight into my very soul. I was then greeted by a loud, deeply-unsettling groan which permeated the landscape, informing the nearby robots of my presence. In my panic, I ran through the field, past the forest, and into a patch of overgrowth just south of my destination. After running in a straight line for close to a minute, I stopped to hear that the grass was being disturbed from behind me.\n\nThen I turned around.\n\n"Behind you"\n\n\n\nI slept with the lights on that night.","May 2, 2014","true","9.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

You can make it difficult too, with the options in the game. I enjoy the fact that there are several types of robots you are up against and have to hide from. It can get very difficult, if you have robots surrounding one single fragment. The point this game strives for being a simulation relating to real-life situations that involve instincts such as finess, subtlety, reflexes, you already know.

Really terrible\n\nThe "tetris like"inventory management is greatly done and innovative... that's what I thought at first... but as you find pieces of the... thing (?) it gets full in no time and you have to go back and forth between islands.\nThe saves, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the saves! Why can't you save whenever you want? Why do you have to be in a boat or go to the Stonehenge construction thingy? Why? It seems like the developers wanted a way to keep you as busy as possible, when instead, they are just annoying you with having to do all those ungrateful tasks.\nThe combat is decent, but really, the same everytime: get in area, kill 2-3 bots, get out. That's it!\nTraps are also friking terrible.\n\nAnother HUGE problem is how big the island are: this isn't a real problem by itself, but considering that most of the times you will have to sneak around enemies... it could litterally take you 15 minutes to get from one side to another of the map.\nThe looting is uninteresting, the game lacks rare and cool guns, bibs and bobs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for a game that's, in great part, composed of looting, the only things you find are rat meat and useless junk 90% of the times?\n\nNo. No. No.\n\nThere is no excuse to this repetitive and badly made gameplay.\n\nThis game has nothing more to offer, than a headache. Not recommended at all.\nI will come back to this when and if there will be a great changelist, that's gonna get me interested again in the game.","January 12, 2015","false","1.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

Well, it IS what I breath.\nSir, You Are Being Hunted is a very unique and fun way to survive and strive to eat and steal from house's and any other natural resource's to live off from.\nIn this game, you are a fellow man, (or woman) who has been put to the test of survival in a very mysterious world that is populated by robots. Now these robot's are not out to shake hands in deal of peace with you, but to shoot you in the face with their weaponry. Sir, You Are Being Hunted offer's a unique gameplay to survival, from running away from a robotic dog that wants to tear off your face, to a monsterous giant that would grind you to the bone.\nThe game offer's many type's of robot's with different and unique "style's" of how they plan to catch you, and how they want to kill you, for example. Some robot's may prefure to spot you out, in a air balloon, then their is the lone robot's that would randomly set up traps and wait for you to carelessly step on it's beartrap and shoot you from their, and their is the natural and  the more common type of robot that would rather hunt in pack's of two, four, or more with the usual rifle.\nI only ever met one freindly robot in a village, rather big, and armed with a pistol. It was curious of what I was and it was rather not interested in "hunting" me down. It would just joyfully give me that freindly wave, I'd wave back. Well that was until it caught me stealing from the village. It got mad and started shooting at me, so I ran. Before that moment, I had honestly thought I had a freind.\nAfter quickly learning later that everything was a danger to me in someway's, and most of the robotic thing's out their wanted to kill me, I decided it was best to try and take a more stealthy approach to etheir get around them or if you are more like me, to simply smash them, shoot them and then rob the robot's for their precious tea and ammo.\n\nAll in short:\nSir, You Are Being Hunted is a game I would definitely recommend to everyone! 10/10 I have not experienced any other stealth, survival games like this before.

To do this you need to find parts scattered all over and dodge some damned clever AI and in some areas some damned scary ones too (the big landowner can ♥♥♥♥ off).\n\nYour entire game, if done with any chance or surviving will be played slowly, stealthily with lots of watching and cunning as you set traps. distractions and occasionally run and gun when it all goes horribly wrong, which in my case at least happens a lot, heh.\n\nIt looks great, has great atmosphere and plenty to see. Gathering the loot is pretty much a survival thing not done for fun and a huge loot chest etc and there is satisfaction at getting one of the robots to step on a trap and beat him senseless whilst he throws threats at you and then loot his stuff.\n\nIf you enjoy patient gaming, slow methodical stealth and those tense moments of hiding behind a bush whilst a 12 foot behemoth walks past you making blood curdling sounds, you may like this. If you enjoy shoot-em-ups, look elsewhere because whilst you can, to a point, play like that it isn't much fun and often ends in tears.\n\nThe game is not shallow, it just is not aimed for everyone.\n\n+The game is positively beautiful at times.\n+This is how you make an atmospheric game.\n+The robots are all in their own way amusing yet terrifying.\n\n-The ground and building textures (in particular doors and windows) aren't quite on par.\n-As you go on, you have to rely on stealth more and more.","May 13, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Definitely worth 20$. 8.1/10","May 30, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Heathen72/recommended/242880/","Heathen72","Heathen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Heathen72/","143 products in account","Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a relatively cheap indy open-world shooter. While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive, it is too short to outstay its welcome too much.\n\nAt its heart SYaBH is a stealth game and you won't survive for long if you use your weapons too much. In this game, as the title suggests, you are the quarry. For those that enjoy permadeath, I think this game is well suited to it. Such an approach would no doubt add grist to the extended-play mill.\n\nWhile I quite enjoyed SYaBH, it could potentially have been a very, very good game, and the developers seem to have settled for a game that is okay to good. Various interesting items and opponents appear in the game that add to the variety, but after the first couple of hours, careful players will learn how to keep out of trouble. From then on it's just a matter of going through the motions. Nothing happens that really shakes things up. There is no second (let alone a third) act to this game.\n\nLike Betrayer (which I also reviewed recently, and to which this game bares some similarity) this game has oodles of flavour and atmosphere, but not a lot of variety. Unlike Betrayer, SYaBH makes your goals clearer and there is a little bit more to be found on the islands. There is also a lot more humour in this game. While Betrayer was a very pretty looking game and SYaBH falls a little short in that regard, the graphics are more than adequate to create the 'baskervillian' moors.\n\nVerdict: If you like sandbox (or stealth) games, you are a bit of an anglophile and the game is on special, give it a go.","May 13, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game gets it right with it's perfect blend of sillyness, stealth, and insecurity. I mean really, Stealth action AND looting!? Oh and one more thing, British. Robots.

Be warned: if you lack patience, you will hate this game. If you play stealth mode in rpgfps games like deus ex, thief, etc you will love this. Really gives that feeling of a struggle to stay alive and accomplish your mission without being seen. Very basic mechanics and goal, but very enjoyable and immersive atmosphere thus far. Love the fact you can fully customize each stage of progress to make it more or less challenging or unique for different style playthroughs. I can see myself playing this repeatedly once I finish the default playthrough. Have not experimented with the custom terrain tool, but it states it is still very buggy, so I guess I'll wait on that for later. Anyhow, great game so far, the different biomes all have a very unique feel so make sure you have one of each in your playthrough! *rural is pretty boring compared to the others and the starting island is always rural.*","July 13, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do you like robots? Do you like -punk universes? If at least 2/3 of your answers are yes, you should get this game! I've been playing it since it was early access and feel like the devs have managed to balance every item and robot type very well, and you can tweak stuff in the options to suit your tastes.\n\nSome initial reviews say that you don't really feel as hunted as the name suggests, and at the time that was true. The robots spent much of their time with the teleporter fragments you're gathering, largely allowing you to set the terms of the confrontation. In the full release, however, the devs have upped the number of robot patrols and depending on how your island generated, you really can't get too far without having to duck in the grass, the bushes, the woods or behind a structure. There's gentleman robots looking for you all around. There's trappers in the woods / bushes. There's bots ready to stalk you on the fields. Every environment (but not every island type) has its own special hunters, and some hunters look for you all around. Lucky for you, some of the bots don't get along and will fight when they encounter each other, allowing you a chance to escape or get some loot when things die down. There will usually be some at the fragments too, since the bots know you will be coming to get them sooner or later.\n\nWith the variety of enemy types and starting equipment, beautiful environments that are randomly regenerated each time you start a new game, different options to customize your game (even removing all the enemies if you just like to walk around) Sir is an excellent choice for the stealth enthusiast. The graphics aren't to everyone's tastes, and the open world environment with its own stealth mechanics might rub some of the fans of the genre the wrong way. Personally, I adore the look and the mechanics, but these are the gripes others have repeatedly expressed and which seem to be dragging the metascore down.\n\nTL;DR: Stealth is cool, robots are cool, tweedpunk is cool - Sir, You Are Being Hunted is cool.

It's challenging and the atmosphere puts you in the position of being a prey. At first it is scary in an environment where humans are replaced by robots. Once you are settled the fright factor is not vanished, but you know it's becoming a survival and a vengence game. Absolutely love it! I have just completed this game. Spent a solid 15 hours. It's like British Ninja vs Vintage Terminators.\n\nI have over 300 friends on my Steam and none of them has got this game and only 3 of them wants this. If any of you read this, buy it!

This game is a fully fledged survival game.\n\nThe gameplay is really fun, ranging from heart pounding duck and cover shooting to hiding in the undergrowth waiting for the enemy to pass.\n\nOverall what makes this game good is the replayability, every game is different, the exploration is particulally fun, altough the shooting aspect leaves a little to be desired, most of the time you will either be hiding or sniping from a distance, so that's not such a large problem. The hunger bar feature, although questionable in Minecraft, works well in this, forcing you to venture into the heart of machine infested villages for food, rather then making an encounter with a machine a very rare occurance.\n\nWith a wide variety of enemys ( some terrifying slender men scarecrows), an open ended constantly generating level system, and with a multitude of different playstlyes, tactics and playthrough options available, you'll need to get this game.","December 10, 2013","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Forget dark halways and eary noises, this throws it all out the door. Instead it puts you in the middle of a field, gives you instructions on what to do and tells you to go out and do it. Your first instinct in a survival game is o loot everything, which you should, but then you realize that everything is guarded by robots brandishing mustaches and shotguns and when they spot you it scares the lemon juice out of you. If you try to run, before you know it there is an army behind you with dogs and balloons (complete with spotlights). You'll soon learn the best tactic is to beat their heads in with an axe before any of their robot friends know.  Then take their shotgun and murder everything...\n\nThis game gave me some of the biggest thrills every. It's still in developement so its not even done adding knew and interesting ways to murder fancy robots.

While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive, it is too short to outstay its welcome too much.\n\nAt its heart SYaBH is a stealth game and you won't survive for long if you use your weapons too much. In this game, as the title suggests, you are the quarry. For those that enjoy permadeath, I think this game is well suited to it. Such an approach would no doubt add grist to the extended-play mill.\n\nWhile I quite enjoyed SYaBH, it could potentially have been a very, very good game, and the developers seem to have settled for a game that is okay to good. Various interesting items and opponents appear in the game that add to the variety, but after the first couple of hours, careful players will learn how to keep out of trouble. From then on it's just a matter of going through the motions. Nothing happens that really shakes things up. There is no second (let alone a third) act to this game.\n\nLike Betrayer (which I also reviewed recently, and to which this game bares some similarity) this game has oodles of flavour and atmosphere, but not a lot of variety. Unlike Betrayer, SYaBH makes your goals clearer and there is a little bit more to be found on the islands. There is also a lot more humour in this game. While Betrayer was a very pretty looking game and SYaBH falls a little short in that regard, the graphics are more than adequate to create the 'baskervillian' moors.\n\nVerdict: If you like sandbox (or stealth) games, you are a bit of an anglophile and the game is on special, give it a go.","May 13, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game also has a multiplayer mode so both you and a friend may be hunted down and murdered by robots.In game you are in a archipelago which consists of five islands four of which you may choose the enviroment, the enviroments are: Mountain, Castle, Industrial, Fens, and Rural of which are procedurally generated.\n\nI personally love this game and it is one of my favorite games of all time, though it may be a tad hard or even strange many games could learn from these fancy robots and their actions to make their games better.\n\nOne more thing: updates come about very slowly but these updates+patches are worth the wait.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S. for the devs: you guys blew me away, keep up the good work","July 19, 2014","true","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game could be compared to DayZ or a game of the sort, but I believe it was done better. The game follows a simple yet complex survival algoritham. All items you obtain can be used in one way or another, and sometimes that use is not stated, and experimentation becomes more and more important as the game throws more and more variables at you. The game starts off simple enough: don't die, do a thing with some rocks. But as you get deeper and deeper in and the longer you take, the more complex the game becomes, forcing you to be creative, skillful, strategic, and quick-minded as you take on the growing complexity of the opponent, be it the environment or the other players in the multi-player. Really that in itself is good enough to make an amazing survival game, but it does not stop there! It gets even more amazing as you realize that the developers put enough time and work into the game to make sure there are no cheap wins or losses. The game is well balanced, and this is done by disabling water escape, punishing you for running from opponents, punishing you for assaulting opponents in the open (as opposed to assassinating them or ambushing them), and forcing you to reset... over... over... and over. The difficulty is sufficient to keep you on your toes but not harsh enough to make you give up completely. And because of the aforementioned lack of cheap deaths, you can learn something from every play through, and get a little better each time. Overall, a terrific game, and I'd even go so far as to say it should be the standard for all survival multi-players. Great game.","January 7","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is a survival stealth title that features British Robots and an overall British theme. Your first playthrough will be full of tense moments and take about 10 hours, though anyone accustomed to stealth games may have much more favorable results. As with most survival games you need to consume food and avoid skirmishes with your robotic rivals. If you're interest is lessened by screenshots featuring guns have no fear, you will never become an overpowered thriving individual able to engage 10 robots at once. Using guns will send robots in your vacinity charging towards you and reload times are long and the clips are very small.  Killing robots is a big component of the game, but you have to use hit and hide tactics. Very often you have to investigate a house's defences before you're able to make a move. You'll need to use distractions, traps and a few choice weapons to outwit the robots. Gameplay is very enjoyable, allbeit very short.\nThere are a few issues that can detract from your experiance however: death, poorly placed device parts and an invincible enemy. The game uses a save point system and there are five spots to save your progress. Upon death you return to your last save with everything you did undone. This causes some serious balance issues: suicide runs to find things can have no risk, and 3 hours of inventory management and storing items in houses become totally irrelivent if you forgot to save. I'd honestly prefer some kind of perma-death system to being flat out ignored by the game. The device parts also tend to get clustered togeth on the coast. You can basically beat the game by walking around each island and you'll find 80-90% of the needed parts in most instances. There are two invincible enemies in the game one is a hot air baloon that shines a light on you and makes a ton of noise, but can be temporarily disarmed by shooting the light or easily avoided. The other can one shot you, track you to the ends of the earth, and is difficult to evade, I don't like that one. Usually if I get caught I just save and quit and then reload. I hope they will make this enemy weaker in some way to fix this balance. There is also an early alpha multiplayer up and running. Over all I recomend this game, but be warned it is short and at the end you will feel the developers current design choices are holding back this game's potential.","August 22, 2015","true","25.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

While these games have complicated survival and crafting mechanics with boring enemies, Sir You Are Being Hunted is not so deep in the survival elements (you only need to take care of your hunger meter and your wounds) but the enemies are really funny to deal with. Robots can be challenging and they increase in number and type as you progress in the game. Combat is based on stealh, but don't expect something like Thief. It's just ok, but it works.\n\nI would call this game "S.T.A.L.K.E.R. meets Slender" It's very atmospheric and tense. Does it worth your 20 euro?

You are a poor sod of a.. Erm.. Scientist ? Who very unfortunately gets telly-ported to an alternate dimension of sorts.. Or something along those lines, you know its really hard to hear what the narrator says in the intro. As i was saying.... The poor sod of a scientist gets telly-ported to an alternate (And very British) dimension. Where Robots of the tweed wearing kind, hunt silly humens for sport. And here is where the game starts.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nThe gameplay element rolls around stealth about 80% of the time, the remaining 20% are centered on collecting food and SOMETIMES, and i really press SOMETIMES. Attacking a hunting robot, or their dogs. (mangy mutts..)\n\nThe main objective is to find and collect the pieces of the experiment that our unfortunate science fellow was working on and transport them to a circle of standing stones... for... I dont know, to finish the game i quess.\n\nBut anyway collecting food and certain items to distract the robots are usually found in houses and shanties in the wilderness.  Rarely you will find a firearm, which makes fighting those tweed wearing, posh, pipe smoking metalheads alot easier. Unfortunately it also causes a lot of noise and usually alerts every single hunting-party on the whole bloody island...\n\nAnyway for those, trigger-happy, no sense of self preservation types. This game is not for you, since you die. Very very VERY fast.\n\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nNot much to say really, i'm not the best person to evaluate the graphical-fidelity of something. But there were a few places where the graphics weren't quite up to snuff... But if you keep in mind that this is still in early access, that is rather easy to forgive. But not forever....\n\n\nSOUND:\n\nAmbient sounds, "Bleep-Bloop" Bots and the standart gunsounds. you really cant hear the robots coming easily, which caused me some cheap deaths...\n\n*Needs some work.\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nWell, i'm not going to say that this is the best stealth-game ever. It has enough small quirks to prevent that.. However it has enough to merit a play, but yet again it beinng a stealth-survival game. It really does not sound that.. "Appetizing" to some.\n\nSo for those who love survival games, i could recommend this rather easily, although with the small issues within it. I could also recommend this for stealth fans, but rather carefully explaining it first...\n\nA solid 7/10.\n\nIts decent in what it does, but as always with everything in an early state, it doesn't do it perfectly.\nBut i still believe this has the material to come a good game, when it is fully ready.","December 7, 2013","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For lovers of Hentai anime. (I personally call them "Hentai tentacles")\n- Desent multiplayer, but most of the serves are pasworded (just so you know)\n- A lot of loot, food, junk, strange items.\n- Ratings and adjustable number of enemies on each island.\n- interesting objective with a spark of a challenge.\n\nTo sum up, Sir you are being hunted is a greatand stable game, that can be both enjoyed alone and with friends. Defenitely advise bying it and telling your friend (Pluss ask the developers to make like a snow island, where snow storms roam around blinding you and enemies, would be awesome!) and if you are reading this, thank you for paying atteniton to my small text, i hope it will help.","February 13","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

There are a variety of robots, such as robots on robot horses, robots with rifles, robots with blunderbusses, scarecrows that warn other robots, robot hunting dogs, and a giant hot air balloon that will attract robots to your location if you are spotted. With only having a rag to stop bleeding and a bottle of alcohol for vitality, stealth becomes a vital role in the game until you find enough guns and ammo and other weapons, traps, and distraction items to combat the robots, and even then is a huge role in staying alive. Even though sneaking through the map from town to town getting loot, avoiding robots, running from robots, and occasionaly attacking a robot for its loot is fun for a while, this game does lose its fun rather quickly. Because you cannot punch or kick in this game, having a weapon is crucial to defending yourself from the ever-present threat of being attacked by a robot. Typically a game goes like this:\n1. Spawn, get to the nearest town, and loot it, possibly finding a weapon or two\n2. Go looking for a piece of the teleporter (you win the game by returning all the pieces of a teleporter to a place called the stones) and possibly grab it if it is unguarded\n3. Return one or two pieces of the teleporter and then get killed by robots\n4. Repeat this process a couple of times. No problem, right? theres always some loot to be found, right? WRONG!\n5. Get to the point where all the loot that will actually help you is gone, except the occasional food or bottle that can be found in some place that you somehow skipped when you looted a town\n6. At this point, there will probably be a lot of robots, as more spawn as you return more pieces of the teleporter.\n7. Get stuck in an endless cycle of trying to find an ungaurded teleporter piece, then try to get it and run to the stones, but get shot 90% of the time\n8. Repeat 7 until you win\nOverall, its pretty fun, but loses its fun after a while of having no weapons and just being forced to run from every robot.\n","February 16","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hidden messages in the randomly generated maps will help you to piece it together if you play enough. But the story isn't the most important part of this game.\n\nThis game, because levels are randomly generated, can be either extremely hard or very easy. But for the most part the game has a fairly good difficulty, with enemies becoming increasingly difficult to handle as you spend more time playing. This game is advertised as being a stealth game, but you can choose yourself wether to go down that route or just jump in guns a blazing. Both tactics work well. Some players argue that this should not be the case, but it didn't bother me while playing.\n\nThis game can be played with a controller, but I would reccomend sticking with a standard keyboard/mouse setup because it makes inventory management much easier.\n\nThe graphics in this game are not to most amazing. They're not bad as such, but they could be made more detailed, especially the "ground" textures. However, the world generator does a good job of capturing what you could call the stereotypical "brittish village" look (amongst other types of land), and when seen from afar, it does look very nice.\n\nThe sound in this game is good, the ambiance and such sounds do a good job of immersing you, and it can be very jarring (in a good way) to suddenly hear a robot coming up behind you.\n\nBecause things are randomly generated, don't worry about just restarting if you happen to come across a world that places you smack in the middle of an impossible area. The chances of that happening are very low. And if you are finding things too hard or too easy, you can use the newly updated "custom world generators" to swizzle the difficulty.\n\nThis is a really fun open-world stealth game, and definitely worth a shot if you like survival horror games.\n","June 11, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Theres nothing like walking through a field in the dead of night and suddenly hearing strange robotic noises. you duck down into the grass only to see several automatons come marching past, you hold your breath praying that they didant see you, adrenaline rushing through your veins. you rumage through your backpack searching for something to defend yourself with. you find an empty bottle and toss it over the hedge line. your hunters turn and hastily march over to the source of the noise. you turn and run as fast as you can.\n\nDispite my description sounding as if you are helpless and defenseless you are really not, there are plenty of things to use to decieve and kill your enemy.\n\nI would reccomend this game to anyone who loves hardcore survival games and people who love stealth games in general. it has amazing combat mechanics and stealth mechanics and is one of the most finished early access games on steam.\n\nSadly is has a few flaws like a complicated directions system and it can be very difficult to find good loot and food to keep your vitality alive, but dispite these flaws the game is still very playable and i have not encountered a single bug.\n\n9/10\n","April 26, 2014","true","6.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The intensity is non-stop. The entire time, you are searching 5 islands for the mysterious stone fragments, which then need to be returned to the center of the center island. However, with each stone found, the robot hunters become stronger. The game becomes even more intense when you hear the beeping of the robots, indicating that you've been found. You can run, or you can try to fight back with the little ammo you have in your shotgun. Be careful, because each shot you fire is very loud, and will attract many other hunters. The game features stealth with terrain, a visibility meter, vitality (which is hunger and thirst), a day/night cycle, building searching, looting robots, and many kinds of enemies. Overall, the game is horror in its rawest form: you, alone, with many wanting to kill you. That being said, the game isn't really scary, but extremely intense. I highly recommend it.\n\n9.5/10","May 2, 2014","true","38.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

North? West? East? South? Stay in Central? In that specific moment of time, I felt the game was drenching me with choices and oppertunities. I like those moments very much and they get rarer each time I play.\n\nRandom generation  - This is a part of the game I also enjoyed. When you start a new game you'll have the option to change what biome the islands will have (Except for the center island. It's always rural.) and the amount of enemies you'll face.\n\nThe thrill of being hunted  - Since this is a game about stealth, it will punish you for not being stealthy enough and it does so by letting the robots run after you and try to kill you if you've been spotted. Robots will also alert other robots nearby of your presence, which makes the game alot tougher. I have gotten myself hunted and killed a number of times and sometimes a special type of robot will hide in thick patches of forest and wait until you get close enough to them.\n\nAnd now the things I didn't like:\n\nGraphics and textures  - After about 27 hours of running around on islands looking for fragments I have noticed certain graphical errors such as bricks you're able to see through and houses that looks like tall buildings that just sank into the ground until they hit something.\nThe textures makes me cringe a little, especially one of the ground textures that reminds me of Call of Duty's digital camouflage but with fitting colours instead of the traditional black, white and grey. Another example of my despise towards some of the textures is in the castle biome. I enjoy walking up in castletowers and looking down on robots with my binoculars but I always notice that the inside of the towers have the exact same texture as the outside which I find to be a little annoying.\n\nThe goal of the game  - Collect 17 pieces from the islands. Bring them back to spawn. Win the game. This entire process is quite boring and it prevents me from continuing to play due to all of the motivation that was drained when acquiring just a few of these fragments.\nAn example of my train-of-thought when returning fragments:\n"Alright! Returned 3 in a go and I have ... 9 fragments left?!? *sigh*"\n"Screw it! I'll deal with this later."\n\nThe gunplay  - I have to admit that the firearms and weapons lacks authenticity in both sound, look and feeling. The guns have a very basic design and the reload animations are basically non-existent. The revolver's cylinder doesn't pop out of its place so new bullets can get in and double-barreled hunting shotguns doesn't break in the middle. It just tilts itself in a way that makes me think that a hole opens and new shells glide in without me seeing it.\nThe game compensates this by making ammunition so rare that it is nearly impossible to really observe and analyze how a certain weapon looks and feels like.\n\nSurvival  - Survival in games is generally a value that the player has. The player needs to find objects that reduces this value from reaching zero. Survival in this game is exactly what I just described. You walk around and look inside buildings in order to find something to "eat". No sound is played to amplify the feeling of eating. You just "use" the item, it disappears and your hunger has a slightly higher value.\n\nBuildings  - Houses and buildings is a common sight in "Sir, you are being hunted". It can get people pretty excited when they can imagine themselfs walking into an uninhabited shelter, desperately looking ammunition, food or tools. Or just seeking refuge. That doesn't apply to this game. Houses in "Sir, you are being hunted" have the same function as a chest or a crate.\nYou open it up, take what you need then leave. This will make houses in this game useless if you ever need to take cover in them. I personally wish I could get inside houses when I'm being chased. Getting cornered when hiding behind a giant rektangle is one of the worst ways to die, I imagine.\nHowever, this doesn't apply to the aforementioned castletowers.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI like this game. You might not like it. Buy it on a sale. Preferably 75% off. That's what I did.","January 5, 2015","true","33.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Procedurally generated landscapes, an awesome retro-future-dystopian aesthetic and great stealth gameplay await you here.\n\nI adored Dear Esther, Eidolon was brilliant and Proteus was fun - this is similar in the exploration of an unknown landscape - but here be dragons (well robots).\n\nI'm not a huge FPS player, I have finished Portal, finished Fallout 3, left HL2 at that boring car level after Ravensholme and that's about it.  I need a good narrative to get me playing.

North? West? East? South? Stay in Central? In that specific moment of time, I felt the game was drenching me with choices and oppertunities. I like those moments very much and they get rarer each time I play.\n\nRandom generation  - This is a part of the game I also enjoyed. When you start a new game you'll have the option to change what biome the islands will have (Except for the center island. It's always rural.) and the amount of enemies you'll face.\n\nThe thrill of being hunted  - Since this is a game about stealth, it will punish you for not being stealthy enough and it does so by letting the robots run after you and try to kill you if you've been spotted. Robots will also alert other robots nearby of your presence, which makes the game alot tougher. I have gotten myself hunted and killed a number of times and sometimes a special type of robot will hide in thick patches of forest and wait until you get close enough to them.\n\nAnd now the things I didn't like:\n\nGraphics and textures  - After about 27 hours of running around on islands looking for fragments I have noticed certain graphical errors such as bricks you're able to see through and houses that looks like tall buildings that just sank into the ground until they hit something.\nThe textures makes me cringe a little, especially one of the ground textures that reminds me of Call of Duty's digital camouflage but with fitting colours instead of the traditional black, white and grey. Another example of my despise towards some of the textures is in the castle biome. I enjoy walking up in castletowers and looking down on robots with my binoculars but I always notice that the inside of the towers have the exact same texture as the outside which I find to be a little annoying.\n\nThe goal of the game  - Collect 17 pieces from the islands. Bring them back to spawn. Win the game. This entire process is quite boring and it prevents me from continuing to play due to all of the motivation that was drained when acquiring just a few of these fragments.\nAn example of my train-of-thought when returning fragments:\n"Alright! Returned 3 in a go and I have ... 9 fragments left?!? *sigh*"\n"Screw it! I'll deal with this later."\n\nThe gunplay  - I have to admit that the firearms and weapons lacks authenticity in both sound, look and feeling. The guns have a very basic design and the reload animations are basically non-existent. The revolver's cylinder doesn't pop out of its place so new bullets can get in and double-barreled hunting shotguns doesn't break in the middle. It just tilts itself in a way that makes me think that a hole opens and new shells glide in without me seeing it.\nThe game compensates this by making ammunition so rare that it is nearly impossible to really observe and analyze how a certain weapon looks and feels like.\n\nSurvival  - Survival in games is generally a value that the player has. The player needs to find objects that reduces this value from reaching zero. Survival in this game is exactly what I just described. You walk around and look inside buildings in order to find something to "eat". No sound is played to amplify the feeling of eating. You just "use" the item, it disappears and your hunger has a slightly higher value.\n\nBuildings  - Houses and buildings is a common sight in "Sir, you are being hunted". It can get people pretty excited when they can imagine themselfs walking into an uninhabited shelter, desperately looking ammunition, food or tools. Or just seeking refuge. That doesn't apply to this game. Houses in "Sir, you are being hunted" have the same function as a chest or a crate.\nYou open it up, take what you need then leave. This will make houses in this game useless if you ever need to take cover in them. I personally wish I could get inside houses when I'm being chased. Getting cornered when hiding behind a giant rektangle is one of the worst ways to die, I imagine.\nHowever, this doesn't apply to the aforementioned castletowers.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI like this game. You might not like it. Buy it on a sale. Preferably 75% off. That's what I did.","January 5, 2015","true","33.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While the inventory at your disposal is somewhat limited, there are many ways to use it. Whether you would rather distract the enemy or simply gun them down, there is a viable method for you!\n\nThe procedurally generated landscape and buildings ensure surprises around every corner, no matter how many times you create a new file.\n\nThe suspense and style of this game will never tire, as the fear of encroaching enemy forces permeates all.\n\nI would strongly recommend this game to stealth lovers, action gamers, and puzzlers alike. The multiplayer mode is excellent- I just wish more people played it!\n\nOne problem I had was that my cursor intermittently disappeared, making inventory navigation quite difficult.\n\nI found great enjoyment in this game, despite its graphical simplicity. Here is a general summary of my experience.\n\nStep 1: Buy "Sir You are Being Hunted"\n\nStep 2: Start new file. How hard can this be?\n\nStep 3: Enter world. See the robots. Laugh.\n\nStep 4: Run at robots. Kill them all.\n\nStep 5: Get shot. Get shot again. Bleed out. Cry.\n\nStep 6: Respawn. Look for food.\n\nStep 7: Suddenly, Airship. Cry myself to sleep.\n\nStep 8: Respawn. See robots. Run in fear. Hide.\n\nStep 9: Find cool sh*t. Lots of guns. Overconfidence levels rise.\n\nStep 10: Shoot everything. Pull dank trickshots.\n\nStep 11: Steal fragments.\n\nStep 12: Start fire. Run away.\n\nStep 13: Walking in field- get mauled by attack dog. Cry self to sleep.\n\nStep 14: Hear abnormal noises. Landowner ensues. Try to kill. Fail. Die.\n\nStep 15: Scarecrow. Run. Get caught. Shot.\n\nStep 16: Love the Game.\n\nOnce again,  I strongly recommend this game to all.

Don't get me wrong it is a decently interesting game but nothing seems to specifically stand out. The story is failry straight forward and allows technically an infinite replayability, though, personally one play through is enough for me. SYABH seems to be more or less an outdated looking stealth FPS that we see a lot these days that doesn't offer much of anything new. Also it does not really include any aspects of humor, which was disapointing. The only thing I really enjoyed playing this was the ability to customize the map to my liking, dictating what scenery is located where (though this was really basic and honestly nothing special). The fact that "looting a house" is like opening a chest in skyrim. You can't even go indoors (it just opens up a menu screen)! No hiding in the houses from baloon riding robotic sirs for me! (which by the way, was one of the few clever ideas to include in the game). Lots of negative reviews say it is fun for the first hour but then gets boring - this is true. Many others say the game is not very rewarding - this is also true.\n\n+Interesting idea\n+Technically infinite replayability with major map differences\n+Map generation and customization\n+Steam Trading Cards\n-Outdated graphics\n-Cannot enter buildings\n-Overpriced\n-Unrewarding gameplay\n\nDo I recommend this game?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeventhSandwich/recommended/242880/","SeventhSandwich","SeventhSandwich","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeventhSandwich/","72 products in account","I bought this game expecting something cool and suspenseful and replayable, but what I got was a half-baked product that was so low-quality that I couldn't believe that the developers would release something so unfinished under the tag of 'Early-development'.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice in this game is the complete lack of challenge. The bots are completely easy to avoid, and hunger isn't really ever a struggle or challenge for the player because you can find food everywhere in the towns. The only part of the game that comes close to difficult is when the air-balloons fly around and spot you with their spotlight.\n\nSecond, there's absolutely nothing to do in this game. Every game has some sort of direction it wants players to go in. Even DayZ has the loosely defined goal of 'getting tons of cool stuff, making a helicopter, and killing other players'. But in Sir, You Are Being Hunted, there is nothing that the player needs to accomplish. The developers /knew/ this would be a problem in an open-world, single-player game like this, but do you know how they tried to fix it? They added a goal where players need to follow these little shiny 'wisp' looking things to crystal shards so that they can go to another island.\n\nAs a player, I'm left thinking, 'why do I want to even do that'? What's my motivation to collect the shards? The next island is gonna look pretty much the same, and it isn't going to be any harder to clear than the last. The game itself is a chore. A chore I paid like $15 for, and not even a fun one like pulling lint out of an AC filter.\n\nDon't buy this game. I bought it a year ago expecting the money to help the developers work even faster on the game and make a great final product, but now the game is pretty much the same as it was when I bought it.\n\nOh, and one final note. The voice-work in this game is pathetic. It's some guy with a painfully-fake British accent talking into a headphone microphone. You can even hear it 'pop' when he says 'p' syllables because they didn't even have a professional microphone with a pop guard. It makes me angry to think where the 'early-development' money PLUS the kickstarter money went.","August 16, 2014","false","1.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Run around island looking for smoke that indicates scavenger hunt pieces. Either chuck a bottle to distract or just kill the couple guards at the piece. Collect it. Repat until island is clear. Run back to start, deposit pieces. Repeat with the other islands. The various enemies really aren't that interesting and are easily avoided. If you do get spotted, you can just outrun things until they fall far enough behind. There's no real sense of fear at any point. The classes are pointless because it's so easy to find plenty of items that what you start with hardly matters. The only items that are really useful to have as early as possible are any kind of gun and the map. I did one playthrough, beat it in ~2h with one death 5 mins in while I didn't have a gun yet.

This game has anything but. Using a controller the controls are at best awkward, and at worst make the game unplayable. The only controller option is "Enable controller", and if you want to tweak the controls they're all listed as keyboard keys. (So if you want to change the controller settings you're in for a lot of headaches and guesswork.)\nNow I know some PC gaming purist is going to say, "Why don't you use a keyboard? It's the superior input method." Keyboard gaming is horribly uncomfortable and I can play for about fifteen minutes before my arm feels like its about to snap off.\nThe game looks like a lot of fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brownjor10/recommended/242880/","Brownjor10","brownjor10","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brownjor10/","211 products in account","This game isn't terrible but it could use a lot more work, like most Early Access games.  Good base plan: survive in open world where your only real goal is to escape.  I've always wanted to resident evil game like that, where you randomly find lickers and tyrants in the city and can run or fight.  Back to topic...  Good plan, lazy execution.\n\nFirst, you can't go inside of buildings.  Just one question... Why?  In an area full of evil robots (or any enemies searching for you) crouching in the 2nd story window of a house and shooting down or throwing a bomb would feel great!  I understand this game is about being sneaky and hiding if you can, but that's even more reason to be able to go in building.  The general world doesn't have too great of hiding spots.  You need buildings to hide in and jump to and from just to get around anywhere that has more than one robot.\n\nSecond, any robot with a gun deals so much you are lucky to survive and patch yourself from the first shot.  Then, even if you do survive, you can't (to my knowledge) put bandages on your hotkey bar.  So, you can't instant patch yourself, meaning you have to pause and do it while they are still chasing you or else you will bleed out in about 10 seconds.  God forbid you get hit in a field or an area with nowhere great to hide, because you will get shot and killed while trying to bandage yourself.\n\nNext, minor complaint: I do wish it was true open world.  I mean that the islands were all loaded with a render distance enabled.  Having to teleport from boat dock to boat dock is a little lame feeling.  I want the moment of running from robots, hopping on a boat and sailing out while ducking in to the boat and barely escaping in to the sea.  Then having the excitement of finding a new island and trying to find a safe place to dock.\n\nI'm pretty good about going on for a really long time when reviewing games, so I'll cut it here, but I just have to say: Good start.  Great idea with the possible escape to try and give the open world genre some feeling of meaning, unlike games like minecraft which, while very fun with friends, can get dull fast when you realize all you are looking forward to is fighting a very laggy dragon that clips through blocks, to get an egg that does nothing.  But if this game wants to be remembered it needs to open it's doors (literally) and brouden it's scopes.  Also, not sure if this is a thing, but it would be cool if you could use hotair balloons you shoot down.  Patch them, etc.  Then be able to fly anywhere with them (again requiring a true open world).\n\n","July 11, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The whole concept is amazing and i'm glad I purchased it in the alpha stage because i'm completely devoted to seeing it through. The only problem is the robots. Not that i'm not thrilled to have tweed-wearing robots as the enemies, but sometimes I play and its too much trouble for me to try to go into a town to try and loot some houses. It seems that the robots in a town are so closely linked so that if you set off one it alerts all of the other robots on the island. Well, im exaggerating a little, but the robots are very alert to the others. When the robots shoot you, the blood loss is incredible. I know thats what rags are for but you can bleed out in a matter of seconds so they're not the bet choice sometimes. Maybe add a syringe for health?

As opposed to DayZ, where survival is a goal in itself, "Sir, you are being hunted" has a general objective. The latter which is single and clear, but while still giving you immense freedom when it comes to choosing your way to success.\n\nAlthough you have multiple personas to choose from (trapper, drunk, artist...), the Aristocrat is still the one that gives you the fullest experience (nothing but bandages at the start). I'd recommend starting with him.\n\nNote for Vista users: It works, BUT will drain more resources than it should because of the lack of support for this OS (and hence optimization).

Is so creepy, you have to hide as best as you can. i prefer to hide at night because I can't see too well then.\n\nNow professionally......\nI quite enjoy the game. When I first tried out the game, it was relatively simple. Squires in towns that you can't let see you looting houses otherwise they get irritable, poachers in the woods that force you to be wary of bear traps, scarcrows that work like living weeping angels that don't kill you but scream like crazy, a blimp, a seamonster, and normal hunting robots with their temporary bear trap dogs. Now, It has branched out a fair bit. Now there are very speedy horsmen who run you over with the force of a steampunkish floating car and knock you flat in doing so, a castle biome, the landowner with his cane & freaky horn noises & knocking you flat on your back where his 2 pet hounds finish you off and or trap you, and much fewer fragments to find beefore you win. As a side note, something weird happened yesterday in the game for me while I was offline but that can wait until later. Anywho, all this christmas pudding and brandy and such, is simply delicious. For me, this is a game of eats, sweets, meats, hunting, running, hiding, ambushing, trapping, eating bad food, hurting, eating all sorts of random mushrooms you find, shooting, hacking, sneaking, stealing, escaping, and definitely more but I don't know what.\nAlso, I propose 2 new things to add to the game. Fishing, and either digging or undrground tunnels with exceptionally well hidden entrances. the tunnels would probably be in the mountain biome. I know that you are working on the multiplayer thing right now probably, but I mean when you are done with that I think it might be a good idea. Maybe adding a mine biome? There is or was such a thing as mines on small islands.","December 17, 2013","true","42.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Is so creepy, you have to hide as best as you can. i prefer to hide at night because I can't see too well then.\n\nNow professionally......\nI quite enjoy the game. When I first tried out the game, it was relatively simple. Squires in towns that you can't let see you looting houses otherwise they get irritable, poachers in the woods that force you to be wary of bear traps, scarcrows that work like living weeping angels that don't kill you but scream like crazy, a blimp, a seamonster, and normal hunting robots with their temporary bear trap dogs. Now, It has branched out a fair bit. Now there are very speedy horsmen who run you over with the force of a steampunkish floating car and knock you flat in doing so, a castle biome, the landowner with his cane & freaky horn noises & knocking you flat on your back where his 2 pet hounds finish you off and or trap you, and much fewer fragments to find beefore you win. As a side note, something weird happened yesterday in the game for me while I was offline but that can wait until later. Anywho, all this christmas pudding and brandy and such, is simply delicious. For me, this is a game of eats, sweets, meats, hunting, running, hiding, ambushing, trapping, eating bad food, hurting, eating all sorts of random mushrooms you find, shooting, hacking, sneaking, stealing, escaping, and definitely more but I don't know what.\nAlso, I propose 2 new things to add to the game. Fishing, and either digging or undrground tunnels with exceptionally well hidden entrances. the tunnels would probably be in the mountain biome. I know that you are working on the multiplayer thing right now probably, but I mean when you are done with that I think it might be a good idea. Maybe adding a mine biome? There is or was such a thing as mines on small islands.","December 17, 2013","true","42.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The whole concept is amazing and i'm glad I purchased it in the alpha stage because i'm completely devoted to seeing it through. The only problem is the robots. Not that i'm not thrilled to have tweed-wearing robots as the enemies, but sometimes I play and its too much trouble for me to try to go into a town to try and loot some houses. It seems that the robots in a town are so closely linked so that if you set off one it alerts all of the other robots on the island. Well, im exaggerating a little, but the robots are very alert to the others. When the robots shoot you, the blood loss is incredible. I know thats what rags are for but you can bleed out in a matter of seconds so they're not the bet choice sometimes. Maybe add a syringe for health?

As opposed to DayZ, where survival is a goal in itself, "Sir, you are being hunted" has a general objective. The latter which is single and clear, but while still giving you immense freedom when it comes to choosing your way to success.\n\nAlthough you have multiple personas to choose from (trapper, drunk, artist...), the Aristocrat is still the one that gives you the fullest experience (nothing but bandages at the start). I'd recommend starting with him.\n\nNote for Vista users: It works, BUT will drain more resources than it should because of the lack of support for this OS (and hence optimization).

Initially the bad graphics and the 'fetch all the peices across the map' game mechanic turned me off. But after playing for a few hours i became incredibly absorbed. At the beginning and most likely for the first few hours you play this game as you learn the mechanics , the dastardly british robots seem pathetic , they move around in small groups of 2-3  and can be dispatched with ease from a few blows with an axe. DO NOT LET THIS FOOL YOU as you collect more of the fragments needed to complete the game the amount of robots hunting you increases exponentially. Near the end of the game by god do you feel hunted as you crouch in a thick field of wheat and pray that you will not be found as the sounds of countless robots walking mere metres from you chills your blood , you know that if they had thought to bring there matallic hunting dogs with them or if they had run into you 5 minutes back when you were traversing an open field then you would not be alive to pray this prayer. As the amount of robots hunting you increases so to do does the variety. Each one is vastly different and you must relearn many of the lessons you have learnt before. Being able to increase the amount of robots and the times when they appear is a very fun feature as you can vastly increase an already difficult game. I bought sir you are being hunted 80 percent off in a sale i have had it for two days and have already put 14 hours into it (the time it says i have played is alot less than the actual time do to most of my playtime being offline) .

This game will take care of all of your needs. Want to hide around the corner from a squad of robot hunters while sipping lukewarm tea? Now you can! Strike fear into the hearts of your enemies by equipping everyone in your game with a trumpet and stroll through the streets, sounding off the war horn, warning all the robots of their incoming demise.\n\nI remember it like it was yesterday, *BUUUUUUUURRRRRRRR* *BURRRRRRRRRRRRRR* *BUUUUURRRRRRR* We took down countless robots trying to gather the pieces of the teleporter all while keeping our spirits up with the lively trumpet of freedom. Living off of the food we scrounged together, mainly wisky and tea, we kept our strenght at maximum. We all had our designated weapons of choice. I was the shotgun specialist with an axe and no regard for the law. Near the end of our struggle to escape, we came across an ammo supply shortage during our biggest battle yet. Thankfully we never lost our morale due to the constant *BUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRR* our trumpeter played, both to keep us from retreating from the robot scum and to strike fear into their hearts. We started to take casualties due to having to make the fight more upclose and personal, but we never stopped the trumpet. The trumpet is a symbol of freedom, of hope. The last one of us starts to make a break for it towards our safe zone, littered with traps and stocked full of supplies. Not once did he let up on that trumpet. At this point it was just so that the robots wouldnt lose track of him into our turf. The trumpeter makes it into the ruins of a large building surrounded by small walls, filled with bear traps. This is the last stand. We need to let the world know. He climbs to the top of the pile of rubble in the center of the ruins and... *BUUUUrrrrrRRRrRRrRRrrRRrRRrrRrrRRrrRR*. Robots stepping on traps left and right. Never once letting go of that trumpet. Never once giving up hope. Not once will we let up on the trumpet. Not once will we stop taunting them with our freedom. The last trap is sprung. A robot dog dashes up the rubble and tackles the trumpeter off of the top.\n\nThe battle is over, but we've left our mark.\n\n10/10 would trumpet again.","October 15, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Gameplay looked smooth in the trailer, but I could not get it to run smoothly even on the lowest graphical settings, which were very poor. The game is very poorly optimized, and is a long way from being playable. The only voice in the game is very badly recorded, and gave me a headache.

The victorian era robots, the abandoned country side, the stealth and survival mechanics, the procedurally generated environments; those all sound wonderful.  Hell, my first couple of hours were very enjoyable.  The environments feel organic, the enemies are scary (at first), and exploring the first couple of islands is an enjoyable experience.  Unfortunately, it is very repetative, and any potential for deep gameplay disperses as soon as one realizes how easy it is to abuse very simple mechanics.  The stealth is uninspired, and the survival mechanics are ruined by an over-abundance of food.

Numerous robots of varying scariness and abilities are on the hunt for you and at times it's like being on Argyle Street on Xmas Eve due to the number of determined bodies in your field of view.\n\nThis is a straightforward game that provides suspense, thrills and chases.

The trickery and  stealth in Sir, You Are Being Hunted is quite unique and runs smoothly, though I was dissapointed by the shooting mechanics.  you always get a sufficient amount when looting, and you can find some uselfull things to use. In conclusion, I felt dissapointed after playing this game, but could potentially be more enjoyable if a few of the points I suggested were improved, though for now I did not enjoy the game.","July 30, 2014","false","12.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZachHoneycomb/recommended/242880/","ZachHoneycomb","Zach Honeycomb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZachHoneycomb/","153 products in account","In this particular gem, you play as an Englishman who's been transported to a quintet of dreary islands by a machine. Robots of every social class roam the isles and are busy hunting you as their own little fox so they can kill you. In order to survive, you have to hunt wild game, rummage through the various (thoroughly de-human-fied and therefore abandoned) buildings, and track down pieces of the machine that sent you to the robot-ruled hell. Lower class, upper class, it doesn't matter which they're from, each and every breed of robot has its own unique method of coursing you. This is not a game where you blast through hordes of enemies and stand tall with a crass cigar between your teeth. You have to take careful stock of each and every potential encounter and perform a cost-benefit analysis, as even two or three robots can annihilate you with a single volley of their shotguns and rifles. Combine this with a limited inventory space, and you have a pleasant challenge. The islands are also randomly generated, which makes each playthrough unique. You can modify the generator to a wonderful degree, producing a ton of island variations. If you want to be both scared and amused, I would suggest getting this game right away.","October 9, 2014","true","15.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Looked like Britain, though, I couldn't be sure. I had only my shotgun, a trombone, and a couple bags of chocolate biscuts. I was running low on tea. I needed to get to that house... but they were right there.... But luckily, I had set a trap earlier. I played my trombone as loud as I could, making insane sounds that blasted through the night. SNAP! It had been caught. With a single shot, I took the hunter down. He had some ammo on him, but nothing more other than his broken gun. I had proceeded to the house... quietly... carefully, like some sort of RPG thief whose stats were high in stealth... but not enough... WHAM! Right then, one of their damned blood hounds had pounced on me, I fought for my life, hoping it wouldn't bite my face off. I had shot down the hound, but then, it was already over; another one had caught me behind my back and blasted me through my chest. As blood leaked out, slowly and painfully, I tried to wrap up the wound with some rags, but from another shot from his gun, I was already dead. Damn robots.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hellonion/recommended/242880/","hellonion","Hellonion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hellonion/","134 products in account","HNNNNNNGGGGG. This game is a survival fps, a mix of STALKER and Don't Starve. The genre it self is already my GOTY. I am recommending this as of Aug 22, 2013. Its currently in alpha so don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nYou are a human. You are stuck in this dark/grim looking world with robots hunting you (you are an alien to them).  Your mission is to collect pieces of these magic rocks to power up this mechine that takes you back home. Along the way, you must stay alive and don't starve. You must search houses or robots you killed for supplies to stay alive till get back to the real world.\n\nGameplay: Its an FPS; find gun, shoot robots, don't starve, SURVIVE. You start out with nothing and you need to search for your 1st weapon. Weapons ranges from currently that I see in game are, axes, bear traps, revolver, 2 barrel shotty and a hunting rifle. Guns seems inaccurate so you do need to conserve ammo ALOT. Robots consists or dogs, normal huntsman in various cloths (seen in title art), fat town mayor guy and a flying ballonist spotter with floodlights that alarm nearby robots. To stay healthy you need to eat things, some things are bad for you like rotten food but you can cook some game. Currently you can't hunt game yourself so you have to find them in houses/robots and cook them at bonfire. Stealth is a BIG part of your survival. You are not a bullet sponge and you will be killed because currently it feels like the robots have aim/wall hacks. But you do regen health as long as you're not starving. Inventory management is also a big part of your survival. Its a tetris based bag and you have limited space where you can store things. You have to choose weather to pick up food vs ammo vs gun vs space to pick up those magic rock fragments to stay alive in the world. Also there is no storage chests so you have to be a hobo and scavage things or store them in nearby houses and hope you know where to refind it.\n\nFor comment on art style of this game just youtube, I can't really describe it to you. Its not realistic, its kind of a grim/dark cartoony thing but its VERY fitting to what they have going on.\n\nOverall, I LOVE THE GAME and this can and will be my GOTY when it release. If you want to try it out BE WARNED: ITS IN ALPHA, updates will change gameplay. What I heard is dev is thinking about adding mulitplayer (so DayZ with robot as zombies with guns...HNNNNNNNNNNGGGG) and new content like trappers with traps that set up and wait for you to get caught and kill you.\n\nTL;DR - FPS survival, great gameplay, my GOTY nomination, still in alpha so be warned. >If I didn't like it so much then why did I just write all this review? ITS A ♥♥♥♥ING GREAT GAME.\n\nGet out of here Stalker, you are being hunted...\n","August 22, 2013","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hellonion/recommended/242880/","hellonion","Hellonion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hellonion/","134 products in account","HNNNNNNGGGGG. This game is a survival fps, a mix of STALKER and Don't Starve. The genre it self is already my GOTY. I am recommending this as of Aug 22, 2013. Its currently in alpha so don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nYou are a human. You are stuck in this dark/grim looking world with robots hunting you (you are an alien to them).  Your mission is to collect pieces of these magic rocks to power up this mechine that takes you back home. Along the way, you must stay alive and don't starve. You must search houses or robots you killed for supplies to stay alive till get back to the real world.\n\nGameplay: Its an FPS; find gun, shoot robots, don't starve, SURVIVE. You start out with nothing and you need to search for your 1st weapon. Weapons ranges from currently that I see in game are, axes, bear traps, revolver, 2 barrel shotty and a hunting rifle. Guns seems inaccurate so you do need to conserve ammo ALOT. Robots consists or dogs, normal huntsman in various cloths (seen in title art), fat town mayor guy and a flying ballonist spotter with floodlights that alarm nearby robots. To stay healthy you need to eat things, some things are bad for you like rotten food but you can cook some game. Currently you can't hunt game yourself so you have to find them in houses/robots and cook them at bonfire. Stealth is a BIG part of your survival. You are not a bullet sponge and you will be killed because currently it feels like the robots have aim/wall hacks. But you do regen health as long as you're not starving. Inventory management is also a big part of your survival. Its a tetris based bag and you have limited space where you can store things. You have to choose weather to pick up food vs ammo vs gun vs space to pick up those magic rock fragments to stay alive in the world. Also there is no storage chests so you have to be a hobo and scavage things or store them in nearby houses and hope you know where to refind it.\n\nFor comment on art style of this game just youtube, I can't really describe it to you. Its not realistic, its kind of a grim/dark cartoony thing but its VERY fitting to what they have going on.\n\nOverall, I LOVE THE GAME and this can and will be my GOTY when it release. If you want to try it out BE WARNED: ITS IN ALPHA, updates will change gameplay. What I heard is dev is thinking about adding mulitplayer (so DayZ with robot as zombies with guns...HNNNNNNNNNNGGGG) and new content like trappers with traps that set up and wait for you to get caught and kill you.\n\nTL;DR - FPS survival, great gameplay, my GOTY nomination, still in alpha so be warned. >If I didn't like it so much then why did I just write all this review? ITS A ♥♥♥♥ING GREAT GAME.\n\nGet out of here Stalker, you are being hunted...\n","August 22, 2013","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You're going to bleed to death, you're going to starve to death, you're going to be shot with shotguns, or blugeoned with giant robo-canes, or gnawed on by vicious robo-hounds, or spmething equally unfair.\n\nThat's sort of the point though. This game isn't at all fair, and it makes that the central theme. You, Sir (or Madam) have been unceremoniously deposited in an alternate dimension. In Britain. Your interdimensional whatever has exploded all over five islands, and in order to get home, you needto find the smoking remains and cram them in to a conveniently sized hole in a magic rock.\n\nAlso, there are a lot of robots, and no people.\n\nRobots have a pretty good idea what you want, and despite some clearly worded letters to the contrary they aren't inclined to give it to you. They'll do a pretty decent job of patrolling, on foot, in baloons, with robo-hounds, and they'll make a habit of frequenting the places where you find things you need to not starve to death or die from being mauled by robots.\n\nAs you retrieve the pieces of your gizmo, the robot hunt will intensify, adding new types of robots to the hunt and increasing their number.\n\nLuckily, you have the opportunity to save your progress at the aformentioned magic stones, or at the boats that carry you between islands. You should do that, because you're probably going to die once or twice.\n\nAside from weaponry (which is pretty scarce) there are plenty of insteresting gizmos to spice up your experience including bear traps, fire, trombones, alarm clocks, toy trains, hallucinogenic mushrooms, and a slow of other useful or just fun to find stuff to help, hinder, or amuse you along the way.\n\nI highly reccommend this game to anyone who enjoys a decent stealth experience, roguelikes, or those who like survival games like DayZ or Nether but don't appreciate the PvP focus found there.","May 4, 2014","true","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hellonion/recommended/242880/","hellonion","Hellonion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hellonion/","134 products in account","HNNNNNNGGGGG. This game is a survival fps, a mix of STALKER and Don't Starve. The genre it self is already my GOTY. I am recommending this as of Aug 22, 2013. Its currently in alpha so don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nYou are a human. You are stuck in this dark/grim looking world with robots hunting you (you are an alien to them).  Your mission is to collect pieces of these magic rocks to power up this mechine that takes you back home. Along the way, you must stay alive and don't starve. You must search houses or robots you killed for supplies to stay alive till get back to the real world.\n\nGameplay: Its an FPS; find gun, shoot robots, don't starve, SURVIVE. You start out with nothing and you need to search for your 1st weapon. Weapons ranges from currently that I see in game are, axes, bear traps, revolver, 2 barrel shotty and a hunting rifle. Guns seems inaccurate so you do need to conserve ammo ALOT. Robots consists or dogs, normal huntsman in various cloths (seen in title art), fat town mayor guy and a flying ballonist spotter with floodlights that alarm nearby robots. To stay healthy you need to eat things, some things are bad for you like rotten food but you can cook some game. Currently you can't hunt game yourself so you have to find them in houses/robots and cook them at bonfire. Stealth is a BIG part of your survival. You are not a bullet sponge and you will be killed because currently it feels like the robots have aim/wall hacks. But you do regen health as long as you're not starving. Inventory management is also a big part of your survival. Its a tetris based bag and you have limited space where you can store things. You have to choose weather to pick up food vs ammo vs gun vs space to pick up those magic rock fragments to stay alive in the world. Also there is no storage chests so you have to be a hobo and scavage things or store them in nearby houses and hope you know where to refind it.\n\nFor comment on art style of this game just youtube, I can't really describe it to you. Its not realistic, its kind of a grim/dark cartoony thing but its VERY fitting to what they have going on.\n\nOverall, I LOVE THE GAME and this can and will be my GOTY when it release. If you want to try it out BE WARNED: ITS IN ALPHA, updates will change gameplay. What I heard is dev is thinking about adding mulitplayer (so DayZ with robot as zombies with guns...HNNNNNNNNNNGGGG) and new content like trappers with traps that set up and wait for you to get caught and kill you.\n\nTL;DR - FPS survival, great gameplay, my GOTY nomination, still in alpha so be warned. >If I didn't like it so much then why did I just write all this review? ITS A ♥♥♥♥ING GREAT GAME.\n\nGet out of here Stalker, you are being hunted...\n","August 22, 2013","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

British country side where robots hunt you down and you must survive? sold to the man for 20 bucks in the black suit. Ultimatly what it comes down to is running, shooting, drinking and dying. Now you maybe asking me, is it fun? Its ok, but its certainly nothing thats hasn't been done before, they promised to add co-op (which is one of the reasons why i bought it) but it never was implemented. Games running on the Unity engine can look really good (Guns of Icarus Online) but this isn't one of those. I have yet to re-install it after all this time and guess what. i am not at a loss at all. My two regrets of this game was buying it and convincing one of my friends to buy it as well. There are PLENTY of survival crafting games out there (the market is practically bursting at the seams) and more so PLENTY better than this one.

Шутер от первого лица и стелс являются основной ставкой геймплея. Большую часть времени вы занимаетесь тем, что ищете осколки артефакта, разбросанные случайным образом по случайно сгенерированому миру. Если доходит до стычек с роботами, то приходится использовать пушки (дробовики, ружья, снайперские винтовки, пистолеты) и вовлекать себя в совершенно неадекватные интеллигентные перестрелки. Дело в том, что враги двигаются по необычной, даже хаотичной, траектории, которую сложно предугадать и описать словами. В любой момент раненый оппонент может устроить тактическое бегство 'задом' или вовсе начать отстреливать своих же сородичей. Мне кажется, что так они изъявляют несогласие с чрезмерной шумностью братьев по металлу, потому что "неподобающее поведение недопустимо, сэр". Хотя, в случаях количественного перевеса следует и самому поберечь силёнки, так как одно меткое попадание может снести вам голову. Правда, тело протагониста невидимое, но это уже другая история...\n\nПолный обзор читаем тут:\n\nhttp://igrotop.com/games/sir_you_are_being_hunted/posts/obzor_sir_you_are_being_hunted","June 25, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was fairly intrigured. But then I got in game.\n\nThere is a clear "goal" for this (collect all these missing parts) but there are what, 20 of them? In 5 HUGE sections? I couldn't even find one in about 30 minutes. If it is going to take me hours to find 1 part I don't want to even bother trying. On top of that, this goal isn't really satisfying and there are no shorter-term quests or anything so you lose track of objectives real quickly.\n\nThere are houses and stuff to loot, sure. I started out looting every single one. Then I realized that they are just randomized "chests" that give you the same garbage items 90% of the time (dead rat, broken plate, moldy bread, a rock). It is super time consuming to just go through one by one and loot every door when the reward is useless. My inventory filled up very quickly.\n\nI got to a new area and finally found a pistol and a hatchet. Great. -Finally- some combat. I found some robots wandering. The combat was awful. Their AI is incredibly bad. You can walk right past them and they will be alerted and see you, but then they will take cover behind a house rendering them useless. They cover from you but end up making themselves do nothing since they are just hiding the whole time. There is no threat there. I ran out of my 6 pistol shots quickly and got bored again.\n\nSUMMARY: this game just seems like a grind for the same objective over, and over, and over again. I don't see the gameplay evolving at all as you progress. Too boring for me. I will say the one thing I liked was the atmosphere. They definitely got the creepiness down.

I couldn't even find one in about 30 minutes. If it is going to take me hours to find 1 part I don't want to even bother trying. On top of that, this goal isn't really satisfying and there are no shorter-term quests or anything so you lose track of objectives real quickly.\n\nThere are houses and stuff to loot, sure. I started out looting every single one. Then I realized that they are just randomized "chests" that give you the same garbage items 90% of the time (dead rat, broken plate, moldy bread, a rock). It is super time consuming to just go through one by one and loot every door when the reward is useless. My inventory filled up very quickly.\n\nI got to a new area and finally found a pistol and a hatchet. Great. -Finally- some combat. I found some robots wandering. The combat was awful. Their AI is incredibly bad. You can walk right past them and they will be alerted and see you, but then they will take cover behind a house rendering them useless. They cover from you but end up making themselves do nothing since they are just hiding the whole time. There is no threat there. I ran out of my 6 pistol shots quickly and got bored again.\n\nSUMMARY: this game just seems like a grind for the same objective over, and over, and over again. I don't see the gameplay evolving at all as you progress. Too boring for me. I will say the one thing I liked was the atmosphere. They definitely got the creepiness down. I enjoyed hiding from the hot-air balloons with spotlights, but that was about it.","October 14, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Шутер от первого лица и стелс являются основной ставкой геймплея. Большую часть времени вы занимаетесь тем, что ищете осколки артефакта, разбросанные случайным образом по случайно сгенерированому миру. Если доходит до стычек с роботами, то приходится использовать пушки (дробовики, ружья, снайперские винтовки, пистолеты) и вовлекать себя в совершенно неадекватные интеллигентные перестрелки. Дело в том, что враги двигаются по необычной, даже хаотичной, траектории, которую сложно предугадать и описать словами. В любой момент раненый оппонент может устроить тактическое бегство 'задом' или вовсе начать отстреливать своих же сородичей. Мне кажется, что так они изъявляют несогласие с чрезмерной шумностью братьев по металлу, потому что "неподобающее поведение недопустимо, сэр". Хотя, в случаях количественного перевеса следует и самому поберечь силёнки, так как одно меткое попадание может снести вам голову. Правда, тело протагониста невидимое, но это уже другая история...\n\nПолный обзор читаем тут:\n\nhttp://igrotop.com/games/sir_you_are_being_hunted/posts/obzor_sir_you_are_being_hunted","June 25, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With a smug sounding narrator telling you some basic information every so often, you quickly pick up the basics of gameplay of movement, looting, and stealth.\nAnd then thats it.\nYou just wander around an island searching for rocks to put in a bigger rock while avoiding robots that are hunting you.\nSure there are letters and little tea sets you can look at but they serve no purpose. After a certain point the narrator even says that he'll be gone and you're on your own for the rest of the game. No crafting, no special items or gamemodes that can only be obtained with certain actions. The only real difficulty in this game is the lack of inventory space. Robots can be easily avoided by walking in a large circle around them with the use of some alarm clocks.\n\nI'd love to see a crafting system or more variety in the game, being able to pick what type of island each one is and what starting items you recieve is hardly variety. Seriously, just look at Don't Starve for ideas to expand gameplay.\n\nI'd rate this a 2/5: this is either an alpha or overpriced","October 17, 2014","false","2.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

You are not very likely to re-play the game unless you are really into rainy british landscapes, and the first playthrough is probably around 5-7 hours depending on your playstyle (and luck).\n\nThese hours do offer you a nice amount of leisurely exploration, thoughtful planning, suspenseful hiding and occasional hasty escapes.

I know that line is clichéd at this point on steam reviews, but I really do, I usually love sneaking and survival games but Sir comes off as really tedious with its gameplay.\n\nI suppose the real thing holding me back on Sir (it's going to make me sound like a casual noob but) is its difficulty. The robots are way too smart and it makes just about every strategy I try guaranteed to fail at least five times. Not the mention the fact that robots have a tendency to always gather around lootable buildings and never leave. I’m always forced to do some sort of trickery that, like I mentioned before, never seems to work on them. Later, I figured that the fastest strategy actually just involved running through and looting as fast as I can since the robots were always too smart for any of my tricks to reliably work efficiently.\n\nEven ignoring all of that, the game’s charm wears off after about an hour of play, and what you’re left with is poorly designed sneaking sections that encourage exploiting to get through them and a combat system obviously designed to make you NOT want to use it.\n\n11/10 –IGN.\n","January 11, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Because I wasn't even able to equip a weapon from the inventory (using both controller or keyboard/mouse). The game doesn't even have a tutorial, and nowhere it is explained, and it is not intuitive. So, after half an hour of frustration (I've played a lot of games, and never it happened to me to not even be able to equip a weapon!!) I quit.\n\nIn that half an hour I've also noticed very poor graphics quality. No, I know that is the art-style (and I kinda like it), I mean other things, like the grass billboards for example. If you look at the grass, you immediately realize it's 2D graphic file that is there to represent grass. I am a novice hobbyst Unity developer and even I know it can be done better. And the opening scene is made of static hand painted images that are so badly painted that I think they were made by a 14 years old art school student.\n\nOverall, this game feels like a nice idea but poorly realized. I wanted to support and indie developer, but the indie developer must also support its customers. 3/10","January 12, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

In a lot of ways the game still feels pretty Early Access in my opinion. One of the best examples is, instead of being able to physically go inside buildings you just open the doors and it brings you to a menu where you can "loot" it. Small things like this, and bland environements, sort of break the immersion of an otherwise fantastic game. The premise and execution are great, but there are a few small details I would like to see fixed overtime.

This really seemed up my alley--turns out that was mostly the (misleading) trailer.  I played through a few hours of mild disappointment, thinking I would just beat it and be done.  I had cleared 3 of 5 islands at this point, and had quickly come to expect nothing but more of the same monotonous slog of gameplay from beginning to end.\n\nSo I go to the West island and... my boat dock procedurally generated right into a sheer cliff's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  No matter, I shrug it off, as I just finished the mountain island and learned you can jump up about any embankment.  At the top of this one was one of the Mysterious Fragments, and some robuts wandering about.  HOWEVER, I must have been wearing a stovepipe tophat I was unaware of, as one of them saw me, behind some thick grass hanging off the edge of a cliff.  After I use my last marshmellow ammo on them, I sigh and reload.  Walking up the dock to bang my head against this, not the first nor last samey, mind-numbing obstacle in this game, a bundle of those robot arms that sprout from water shoot up THROUGH THE DOCK.  I decide not to take any evasive action, and the next keys I press are Alt and F4, followed by Delete Local Content.  I can't think of a single game that's done this to me, or that I did to it in return.  And that was just the straw that broke the camel.\n\nIf you are sick of the Tedious Inventory Management trend lately (of course they don't show that in the trailer), and aren't keen on imprecise stealth gameplay in a large smear of mostly empty wasteland, don't pick this up.  I wish I could get my money back.","November 2, 2014","false","3.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I had such high hopes for this one, but I couldn't even finish it. The graphics were basic, the Sirs... well, the robots left me alone for a few hours while I wandered around the moors enjoying a walking simulator. There wasn't much to explore, you couldn't even enter the buildings. And when the evil robots started appearing... they just shot me from far away and that was it. No witty banter. No feeling of dark menace.\n\nIf someday I get to build my own army of classy, murdering robots, they will be more engaging, I promise.","November 18, 2015","false","9.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"
