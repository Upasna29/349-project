Controls are smooth, gameplay is fast, decent graphics and sounds, the time-control spell makes this game particular. In my opinion, the story is a bit lame, but I do not really care, I forget it when I swing my swords in every directions :P. Collectibles are very easy to find during your walkthrought because maps are not that large, so no time wasted for that, just make sure to use compass.

It's much better than the predecessor 'X-Blades' which isn't even worth your time.  That's not to say it doesn't have flaws, but overall I had fun with it, and it kept my interest long enough to play through it twice.\n\nGameplay is pretty standard hack n slash fare, with two attack buttons and a variety of magical skills you can use fluidly along with your swords.  You also carry a gun you can whip out at any time if you like, and while the third-person shooting may not be as advanced as something like Gears of War, it works and it's easy to use.  There's also an interesting time control mechanic where you can rewind time and fight alongside past versions of yourself.  You'll also use this ability to solve puzzles, although none of them are terribly difficult.\n\nThere isn't a lot of variety in the enemies, but mowing down hordes of them is still good for some mindless action, and when they do change it up you'll have to adapt your approach accordingly.\n\nThe visuals are gorgeous in this game.  The sound design is excellent as well.  The characters however, are kind of shallow (the main character in particular is really annoying), and the story is pretty difficult to follow.  These things aren't the main focus of the game though: the gameplay is.  And the gameplay that is there is solid, and there are many unique game environments to make your way through.  All things considered, this is a pretty decent game.","November 16, 2013","true","39.6"," 45 of 56 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","45","56","0","0"

It's as if someone took a bad game and tried to polish the living daylights out of it: this game is really pretty. The platforming is slippery and tempermental, but the combat is incredibly satisfying and fun, the voice acting is bland and bad (But you can change the language), the story makes absolutely no sense until the end (Although I did actually enjoy not knowing what was going on in this for some reason), the world design is way too over-designed, but I don't know if I can actually complain about that. The characters are terrible (In the best way), the music is good, not outstanding.\n\nBut from a gameplay perspective, it is really fun. Especially when you have all the power-ups and are setting people on fire and freezing them, then rewinding time, letting your past self do all of the hard work while you take pot shots at the rest, then rewinding time AGAIN (I think you can have up to 5 time-clones of yourself) to finish them off with an explosion and stabby stabby times. I'd recommend it, but I'm still scratching my head over the game. It shouldn't be enjoyable, but as a B-movie sort of vibe, I loved it.","January 23, 2014","true","9.1"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","23","27","0","0"

The blade combos are basic XXX or YYY style. This doesn't actually matter though since the real key here is the magic powers you gain throughout the game. It's not really the voice actors fault as most people say, but actually the script they were given to read.\n\nYou play Ayumi a treasure hunter so its natural you would be seeking treasure, but the games dialogue tends to beat you over the head with it so hard that it is really annoying. I mean your gaining magic powers and Ayumi remains conserned over treasure until the very end. With magic powers you don't need treasure would be a logical way of though along with why am I getting these powers?\n\nThe controls are pretty solid for the most part. The only real issue is the instances when you push the counter button and nothing happens. The enemies don't change a ton, but it wasn't bad either. The gunplay is actually very nicely done as well. The later levels add in a new type of gunplay which I've seen before in Darksiders where you get a powerful gun on the floor for certain fights which adds good variety.\n\nThe level design is fantastic. The puzzles aren't that challenging but they help mix up the gameplay. You go from a volcano to a winter scene and your characters clothing changes depending on where you are. The garden level of the skygods is probably the best looking, but the others don't lag to far behind.\n\nThe story itself is better then most people claim. The main issue is your characters lack of interest in it. The notes along the way really help flush it out as well. Everything gets put into place by the end of the game. The ending does solve a lot of problems but it also ampifies your characters lack of believable emotion.\n\nOverall it's a fun game and I would almost say it is criminally under rated by the mainstreem review websites. I'm not saying you'll play it more then once, but it's a great game to pick up for a few bucks.","October 12, 2014","true","11.7"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/recommended/208670/","kalirion","kalirion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/","2884 products in account","This turned out to be a pretty fun action game, though it took a while to get going and I didn't like it as much as, say, Marlow Briggs.\n\nAyumi has, unfortunately, only one basic melee attack that you just keep spamming to work up your "rage meter", which then lets you fire off spells. There's also a Dash move for dodging and closing the distance, and you can switch to a ranged weapon which significantly slows you down and makes you unable to Dash. Once an enemy is at low health, you have the option to perform a finishing move - or just keep wailing on them until they go down. There is also "kick" to break blocks that you rarely need to use. All in all, it's pretty uninspiring until you get enough spells to spice up the combat, and really start using the Rewind Time ability.\n\nRewind Time is actually pretty interesting - it rewinds the world around you, while leaving your character alone. Your character's position and any damage you've taken still stays, so you can't "undo" fatal mistakes like you could in the Prince of Persia games.  Rewinding Time creates a "time clone" of you, that then proceeds to go through all the actions you've taken during those "rewound" seconds. So you could unload half a rifle clip at a charging enemy, rewind time as they get close, and then continue shooting. Their health will be back to where it was at the beginning, but they'll start taking double damage because there will now be two of you shooting! This is actually required for some enemies who are surrounded by magical force fields that can only be broken by extremely concentrated hails of bullets.  Rewind Time is also used for some basic puzzles, such as when multiple pressure plates/switches must be triggered at the same time\n\nMost bosses require some strategy to defeat, but it's usually not hard to figure out, and serves as a nice change of pace.\n\nYou start with the double-jump, which is always appreciated.  As you proceed in the plot, you unlock new spells & abilities, find new equipment (a magical compass pointing the direction of any nearby equipment chest is very useful), and demolish boatloads of enemies.\n\nTL;DR - Fun game once you get enough spells/abilities to make the combat less boring, just don't expect something on the level of Devil May Cry, God of War, or even Marlow Briggs.","February 26, 2015","true","12.7"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","25","31","2","0"

Donut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FallenWyvern/","1018 products in account","Disclaimer: I'm only 2 hours into the game so far (3rd 'world').\n\nBlades of Time was something I picked up on a lark while it was on sale. The fact that it was from the people who made X-Blades (never played, but it looks really fanservicey) and checking a few reviews made it seem mediocre.\n\nI was wrong. This game is wonderful.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it is flawed. Graphics aren't great and the controls aren't as tight as you'd want in a 3rd person platform/hack and slash game but the core mechanics: adding powers to your character, the combat combo system, ranged combat and melee combat all feel great. The real shining point, however, is the time manipulation.\n\nIn games like Prince of Persia, you rewind time to recover from mistakes. Here, you rewind time, which locks you in place and rewinds everything ELSE in the world. Then, there are two copies of you running around. Your former self just continues to do whatever it was that you did at that time, and enemies AI kicks back in.\n\nAn example of this is if you wanted, you could copy yourself a bunch and all have them aim rifles, shooting at a tree. Then make a final copy which kites the bad guy over to where the shots are happening. It's unlikely that you'd need to do this, but it's possible!\n\nAnyway if you see this game on sale, grab it. It's not going to push the boundries of PC gaming, gaming or even your expectations of games, but it will provide you a solid amount of *fun*.","January 28, 2014","true","10.3"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megasan/recommended/208670/","Megasan","Megasan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megasan/","543 products in account","Blades of time, You play the role of Ayumi who is a duel wielding sword user who is out to find treasure in the mysterious world of Dragon land. While looking for treasure you unfold a story of immortal beaning, chaos, humans, and other unknown creatures in this beautifully design world.\n\nWhile this game is your tipcial hack n slash game. You are gifted with the powers of magic and time. You are able to rewind time back and use your "clones" to help kill certain monsters or help figure out puzzles.\n\nBlades of time doesn't try to push the bar to stand out. However this game does have it's pros and cons.\n\nThe combat in blades of time flows very nicely and is quite fun. However the combat does get repetitive quite often. One of the best things about this game are the boss fights. They feel like they are really boss fights and you can't just go in hack n slash like alot of games. You will need to watch the boss and whats around you to over come them.\n\nThe world which you play in is very beautifully and colourfully, every level you go to has it's over feel and look to it.\n\nThe music for this game is pretty good.\n\nThe character design them self is solid nothing great but nothing bad. With Ayumi her voice at the start of the game did get annoying and it felt like she talked to much and that she had something to say about every little thing that happen. i felt like she needed to tone back on some of the things she talked about.\n\nThe weapons are limted in this game. You have your main weapons the sword, and your off weapon a rifle. While your able to find other items like rings and amulets to give you added bonuses. To find most of these items to you, you will need to use the compus ayumi has to find hidden chest in the game. Whenever you are near by a chest the compus will glow on the back side of ayumi. Once you pull it out you will see a red arrow that will guide you to the hidden chest. However the one thing i did not like was. The chest could be above you, or under you and it will point to where it's at but doesn't let you know if it's above or under you. So you end up trying to find it and then get tired of searching to find out it was else where.\n\nThe overall controlls for this game is pretty decent. However using a mouse even when turning down the sentivity doesn't seem to help much. If you are wanting to play this game i recommand using a game pad over the keybored and mouse.\n\nWhen in the options if you want to change anything for textures, or ajuest your mouse. you have to reluanch the game before it will take effect.\n\nThe story.... well it's a story and it's not really amazing but not really horrible either. it's better than some games ive played but overall it's an ok story.\n\nOverall i think this game is really fun, it has it moments that make you wanna rage but it a good way, enough rage to kept you wanting to push thru and keep playing. the over all world is just very nice to look at and has a great feel. this game is pretty lineard.\n\nthe over all score i would give it would be a 7 out of 10.","December 10, 2013","true","49.3"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JOVELZADO/recommended/208670/","JOVELZADO","oka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JOVELZADO/","450 products in account","Alright! Time for another review.\nSo I've been playing Blades of Time, and as an Hack'n'Slash lover, this game surprised me.\n\nThis is a very addictive game, not because of its story, or voice acting, its puzzles, or anything in particular, but when you start playing it just keeps you glued to it, for short to medium periods of time, but you always need to come back for more. This is only until you finish the main storyline.\n\nSo, what does the game do well and not so well? Here's a list for you:\n\nPros:\nFun fighting, quick and rather easy to pulloff combos* (see in Cons);\nWeapons (such as rifles and cannons) for long range engagements;\nVery distinct areas, a wide variety of sights to amuse yourself and fight your way through;\nDecent and somewhat interesting bossfights;\nHidden chests and rewards spread all over the world as you go through the levels, be on the lookout for those as they hold new equipment* (see in Cons)\nRather interesting main character (Ayumi), as time goes on you start to develop more interest in her intentions and motivation to go on.\nCons:\nNot the best special abilities, since they're all the same, but with different side effects (burning, or freezing your enemies, etc.)\nSome frustrating fights (arenas and/or mini boss fights);\nNot the best graphical fidelity, but has its good moments;\nA lot of the enemy characters look the same and dress the same;\nWeak voice acting, at least in English tongue (in Japanese seems to be better)\nThe rewards you get from hidden chests or bossfights, only have a different stat (e.g. you can have a pair of swords that Increases fire damage and another pair that has a different model but instead gives you Freezes enemies for a longer period), the same goes for rings, amulets, but it's slightly more in-depth when it comes to weapons though;\nSome of the puzzles might be frustrating to finish and some you might even have to take a wild guess in order to proceed to the next area, as sometimes you have no clue or explanation on what to do.\n\nExtras:\n\nDespite the longer Cons list, I really enjoyed this game.\nI didn't mention the storyline above, because it's up to you to love it or hate it. I didn't find it amazing, but it's not bad either if you like the gameplay, you'll go along with the story too. Also, the storyline might last you around 8 hours depending on how many secrets you find and the difficulty you play on.\nThe puzzles are decent, and there are a few of them here and there. Not great, not bad, some are quick and some are frustrating.\nThe multiplayer looks interesting, but it's not working (or at least there isn't anyone playing). It's a shame truthfully, looks really fun and somewhat innovative imho.\n\n\nIf you happen to catch this game on sale or in a bundle, grab it if you can!\nAnd that's it, if you like Hack'n'Slash games, you'll like this one, it's no Devil May Cry, but it's decent enough to give it a go. After all, you're playing this to kill everything around you, right?","November 26, 2014","true","10.4"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","0"

Even by 2012 I thought it was impossible to innovate a hack and slash adventure game. I love the genre, but I just like the colors and combo strategy, I thought God of War covered the good stuff. And then I found this. Another lost gem that faded into non-existence because it's not a major AAA developer. Let me explain myself...\n\nThe best part about this is the time warp system. This is TOO FREAKING COOL! I'd suggest buying this game JUST to experience this mechanic. It's difficult to be innovative in modern gaming, so it's possible it had been done before and I just missed it, but either way it is incredibly fun. Basically you can reverse time in fairly short increments, but your "past avatar" will still exist doing what you just did while your "present  avatar" is free to do whatever. You can make several of these avatars at once to fight alongside you or help you solve puzzles. It's a bit confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it you can't wait to use it again.\n\nHow it works is say you have a group of 3 enemies. You can take out your gun and blast away for 5 seconds at one of them while they charge you. Reverse 6 seconds. Your past avatar will now be there shooting at that same enemy. So now you have a few choices. You can use your present avatar to keep shooting at the same enemy, reverse time 6ish seconds again, shoot at that enemy, repeat however many times you want, and then suddenly have 5+ people blasting this enemy away in 2 seconds. Or you can use another avatar to shoot a second enemy, making them stumble or holding them back. Now you have 2+ avatars distracting two enemies, so you can charge in with your main avatar using swords and melee on the third. To top it off, after, say, 3 seconds of meleeing that third mob, you can reverse 4ish seconds, and now you'll have both your past and present avatar wailing away at this mob. Repeat however many times you want. You now effectively have 4+ warriors on the battlefield attacking at the same time, and even though the process took place over 20 seconds, once you reverse to the very start of the battle and continue time, all 3 mobs will drop dead in an instant.\n\nIt's awesome.\n\nThe next best thing are the puzzles. FINALLY I find another game with unique puzzles that actually make you think without being outrageously difficult just for the sake of being difficult. And it's none of the usual "do this kind of puzzle once then use it a bunch more times." Instead, they draw elements from previous puzzles but add a twist or two to keep it fresh. I still haven't beaten it, but as of now I've encountered 3 different "types" of puzzles and each one has been expanded upon later in the "level" to make it feel new. Well done.\n\nThe next best thing is the graphics. Graphics are normally the least of my worries and something I'll glance at, appreciate, and move on. But considering the time period and developer, this game is INCREDIBLE! It absolutely stands up to some of today's games but is beautifully optimized. It baffles me how a game from 2012 can look, and more importantly run, 1000% smoother than a game from 2015.\n\nThird I'll go with the boss fights. Again, FINALLY a game that has unique bosses that, again, require you to think and stay focused. Not every single one, some are the typical slash away without getting hit, but others do require specific strategies. And hey the strategies aren't always necessary either. You CAN slash away at this boss for an incredibly difficult 20 minutes, but if you learn how to exploit weaknesses, you can take them down in a few attack runs.\n\nNext would be the combat. Not the most innovative aspect of the game, but still a tried and true method that is just as fun as it always is. It starts off pretty generic, but once you start unlocking combos it exponentially increases the fun and some are unique enough to make Blades of Time stand out amongst its God of War and Dynasty Warrior peers. And this is where the time warp mechanic comes in. Just like I was saying with the puzzles, it takes an old mechanic and makes it new again. It's also a good balance between simple and difficult. You cannot just stand there and spam left mouse button. You will die. Though you don't necessarily have to be constantly in motion 100% of the time either...in a good way. You CAN be and it makes it that much more fun, but it isn't completely necessary, which I prefer. I like to jump around a bit and get in hits here and there, then wail away at a single enemy, then jump around a bit more.\n\nHowever I'll finish off with the voice acting and story. To be fair I actually do enjoy the storyline. Maybe it's not pulitzer prize winning, but it is somewhat unique compared to most fantasy games. Unfortunately, as others have noted, the voice acting is horrendous. I actually laugh pretty much any time anyone says anything because it feels so...fake and out of place. You can tell this is where they cut the budget from. If you've ever played an Oblivion or Skyrim mod where the creator did their own voice acting...it's kind of like that. Just awkward with mediocre writing where it's almost difficult to actually pay attention to what they're saying and not how they're saying it.\n\nBut overall I recommend this game to anyone who likes action games, and DEFINITELY anyone who loves hack and slash games. I am actually quite stingy with prices, so t's difficult to say if it's worth $25. I almost NEVER spend more than $15 on a game. Though $25 on Steam for a 4 year old game is somewhat of a testament to the game's quality. However if it's on sale under $15 I wouldn't even hesitate to add it to your cart. If that extra $10 isn't a big deal to your wallet, then yeah I'll definitely give the go ahead for $25.\n\nBlades of Steel\n8/10a\n\nAnd if you're wondering, I actually got it in one of those "10 Premium Steam Keys" for $1.12 at a certain third party retailer site. I gotta say I got some pretty good games in those bundles, I'd say it's worth getting 1 or 2 if you're looking for something new to try.","January 31","true","7.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","16","18","2","0"

Now imagine an interesting story line with some voice acting that does its best to make fun of the main characters hair color. The game play definitely nails it on this one.\n\nYou start off as an adventurer going to Dragon Land in search of treasure. Obviously things aren't as they seem and you run into foes of all sorts. One's that stalk in the shadows to big bosses that will have you dashing, sort of flying, and dodging every which way. The game does a good job mixing up enemies and tries not to bombard the player with boring old schemes. The game is sort of like Too Human where you fight multiple enemies and can attack them with varying sequences. X is the button to attack with your swords while pushing in the right thumb stick will equip your gun (which can be modified or changed as the game progresses given you are picking up the treasures along the way).\n\nThis is where it get's interesting though : along the way altars are available that give you certain abilities that you are able to choose from (such as using fire, ice, or a slide attack technique). For instance, if there is a lot of enemies you can press B then X to unleash a fire attack. To do these special attacks however your character needs enough "rage" to be built. This is done by attacking enemies. With rage other special attacks are available or you may choose to heal yourself. The diversity in the attacks hasn't put me to boredom yet. Right button when a player is injured enough will put the player into an animation (some sort of decapitation involving the foe). This is the best part though and why the game is called Blades of Time... within the game by pressing left button the player is able to rewind time and rewind themselves and their foes. Yes, you rewind your player but your player is immobile and doesn't move as time is rewound. This means that even though you attacked one foe already, you can rewind time, then play it forward again and have two of your characters (of one you control) attack the enemy. This process can be repeated sort of by will after it's learned. Heck if you want you can keep rewinding and have one of your characters attack him with blades, one with a gun, one with specials etc... it is possible. The game's difficulty is also at an appropriate level.\n\nThe visuals are appealing (very appealing I'd imagine for single guys) and screen format is available in 1980X1080 settings. Graphics are not the greatest thing in the world but will not get in the way of game play.\n\nSounds are alright. The voice acting makes the main character seem like a ditz though in some of the things that she says. I have no problem with it, I'm not sure if the devs were going for that but that's what it feels like to me. I'd listen to a bit of the dialogue and have to ask myself "did she honestly just say that"?\n\nThe gameplay by far though is the best thing about this game. How they managed to use time as a weapon was cool especially allowing the player to deal extra damage to difficult opponents.\n\nI got this game in a humble bundle and unless it REALLY REALLY appeals to you I suggest buying it at full price, either than that maybe wait for a sale.\n\n\nRATING : 7.15/10\n\n\nGameplay	B-	Story / Campaign	B-	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	C	Overall 	C+","March 13, 2015","true","2.4"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","25","38","0","0"

If you can keep track of which Prince of Persia or Devil May Cry entries may work on your computer then you'll probably want to purchase them instead, but this plays much better than Garshasp.  I'm curious to see how the previous telling, X-Blades, holds up.\n\nWhere Blades of Time seems to shine is in its Outbreak mode.  This is a MOBA variant which can be played either cooperatively or between teams.  There's a catalog of items/effects to earn and I appreciate having an entry in the genre with decent gamepad controls.  Unfortunately, there is little online competition despite some enthusiasm in the Steam forum.  There is, however, a single player mode where most of the same awards can be earned.  If my review sounds too vague, it's because I've been playing short sessions of this for so long I've forgotten the subtleties of the campaign.\n\nDumb story aside, Blades of Time's real cardinal sin is the placement of checkpoints before cutscenes instead of after.  There's a button to skip through them, but it's still annoying after a dozen deaths in a boss fight.\n\nI wouldn't bother getting the Dismal Swamp DLC on its own.  The included mission removes character abilities in favor of allies to protect.  An Outbreak map might also be included, but if that's what you're after then you might as well get the Limited Edition for the Sky Islands one as well.","June 10, 2013","true","20.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","2"

Blades of Time is a completely linear style third person game about a blonde female character, Ayumi, and her journey in an alternate land. The story is a little mroe intriguing than I thought although there were certain parts and characters I was expecting more development on. In Blades of Time, you are able to freeze attack, fire attack, strong attack, and dash as some of the abilities you can use. Your main weapon is a two katanas and you are also presented a gun later which can be used strategically.\n\nHowever, the most appealing part of the game is the time rewind part. Time rewind allows you to create essnetially "clones" of yourself that fight while you can still fight. In one semi-boss, I just kept creating more and more clones onto the semi-boss to the point where I had enoug damage to kill the semi-boss in the eqvuialence of 5 seconds. Obviously I had a lot of clones hitting him, but you get the point. Time rewind is also necessary to complete some puzzles that advance the level and some enemies actually require you to time rewind to kill. It is such a unique and interesting concept that I'm surprised Blades of Time 2 hasn't come out yet.\n\nThe graphics of this game are pretty beautiful although some things get repeated a little too often. But other than some repated things (doors, enemies, and lever like things, etc), the environment is beautiful and the world is very beautiful as well. However, the graphics can be a little intensive to computers that cannot handle high demanding games. I have a gaming laptop and sometimes it still lagged hard.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Blades of Time for anyone who likes to play third person games. Also, just on a side note: you never actually have to pay full price for this game because there is a perpetual bundle on bundlestars featuring this game and some others for only $2.99 which you can find here: https://www.bundlestars.com/en/bundle/rpg-heroes-bundle For a small $2.99 price, whoever doesn't buy this is losing out largely...\n\nRating: 8.8/10","March 18","true","11.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

There is no block button, but thats's fine, because you'r etoo busy flyig and dashing aorund and stabbing everything and blowing it up with magic.\n\nPuzzles are minimal and generally rely on timed button pressing with the use of the time rewind mechanic.

Nothing really gets explained except for one story point you can see coming from the opening scenes of the game.

For hack n' slash this game is, it offers:\n\n- ok-ish story\n- decent, dynamic fighting system. Especially time rewind. I loved it and abused it.\n- amazing graphics. This game is very pretty to look at\n- a lot of action packed moments towards the end\n- some puzzle elements which make this game not braindead\n- multiplayer with your friends\n\n\nI had only 2 major problems with BoT:\n\n- had to figure out keyboard controls for myself, since game prompted partially keyboard hot keys but for skills only pad keys.\n- if story is concerned, it felt really bad to have to go hacking through the human camp on ship, after so many of them were pretty kind fellas.

I thought the story was incredibly stupid and I was kind of surprised a game like this even had a story. It's the kind of game where every female character looks like they just came out of a 14 year old boy's wet dream. Ayumi isn't even the worst offender of this!\n\nShockingly enough, the characters evolved such that I actually *liked* them- each main character received enough characterization to become real, likeable, *people*, rather than the walking videogame cliches they look like (ridiculously musclebound man, ridiculously over sexualized women). This astounded me; I was not expecting to have anything but contempt for the game's seemingly pathetic attempt at story. The main plot, too, evolves into something worthwhile. The biggest problem this game has is probably the fact that the story and characters are overwhelmingly generic for the first half of the game.... but it does metamorphose into something unique towards the end. Well, the characters do; the story is largely generic still but there are several key plot points that separate it from the rest.\n\nUnfortunately what did not evolve over time was the combat. As far as I know there are no combos to learn besides the very limited set you start out with. One of the combos brings you up into the air as you swing your sword about wildly, *but there are never ever any enemies that will be in the air with you*. What ends up happening is a lengthy animation of you swinging your sword in the air for 5 seconds while all the enemies wait for you to return to the ground. This happens automatically when you jump and attack- so if you need to jump over to an enemy *quickly* and attack him, unless you're very careful you might accidentally start that useless combo and it will prevent you from doing time sensitive things (there is no way to stop once started). I feel like I missed out on a mechanic or two though- you can lock onto enemies and dash at them, but 90% of the time the game bugs out and the dash is in slow motion and you never even reach the enemy. Then I read something about hanging from enemies in midair and hitting them with your sword. Huh. The most I was ever able to do was slide off them like they were covered in motor oil. You gain the ability to use fire, ice and generic projectiles very early on and then (with one exception) from there on out, all upgrades are minor and passive (for example, you might gain the ability to do more damage by using fire on someone who is frozen. No expanded gameplay, just ways to optimize damage). I started out really loving the combat, but it gets very old very fast. And it's very buggy. The entire game is buggy actually. Luckily you can usually fix everything by reloading the last checkpoint, but if your checkpoint is before a particularly challenging battle, that can be frustrating.\n\nAnother major problem with this game is there are too many different mechanics. It feels like I'm playing a very long demo of hundreds of different games. Yes, the combat is boring, but constantly changing the rules of the world is not the way to fix that. At one point you gain wings and can fly, and I don't even think it is explained... then you lose your wings shortly after, also unexplained. I found out by jumping off a cliff and falling to my death. At one point you are given a gun which you are required to use; if you kill the enemies without the gun, they keep regenerating indefinitely, and this is *not explained*. It was pretty obvious I had to use the gun to kill them, but I couldn't quite figure out how, and I couldn't proceed by killing them normally. The biggest problem was the stupid jump combo- you had to freeze the enemy with the gun, then drop the gun and hit them before they thawed, except I would always activate that useless combo and never get to them in time.\nThe time rewind itself is also problematic. For example, the ability is not explained at all. You are told that you have it, then you need to figure out how it works, which is a process that will take the rest of the game. But the game arbitrarily changes the way it works and often doesn't even let you use it! How can you learn to use it if it keeps alternating between different rule sets and often isn't even available to use? So far what I *think* happens with the standard set of rules is; any time clones of you will disappear if the main you alters enough variables in the past. So if you go back in time and get an enemy to follow the current you instead of the past you, the past you just disappears. Which is a problem because most of the time the point of time rewind is to distract enemies- but they mostly seem interested in *you*, not your past clones, which makes them all vanish, which makes the game frustrating. OK, so I understand that, I'll try to use it against this boss now that I'm a little better with it. Oh wait, you can't. Why? Because. Time rewind is not available to you for nearly *every single boss*. Then, some of the larger enemies require that you use it, but the way it works is completely different for those enemies. In one case- there's a quick time event which you need to do twice at the same time. Cool right? Not really. You do it once, you rewind time and if you don't press the button *immediately*, you lost your shot at it and you need to spend 5 more minutes weakening the enemy again. To reiterate- you can't just go back in time and wait for the opportunity to use the quick time event going forward in time, you have to hit the quick time event whilst going backwards in time.. because for some reason your clone disappears in this particular context (you can't make time rewind clones). Then, on the giant worm boss, you can make time rewind clones but the moment you do the boss just retreats, changing variables and erasing all your clones immediately. The logistics of this time rewind thing is complicated enough without all the arbitrary exceptions and changes.\n\n\nI can't decide if I like this game or not. On the one hand, there are unique gameplay and story elements that are definitely worth experiencing; there is nothing else like it. On the other hand, the game doesn't respect itself enough to expand upon the more interesting elements and instead chooses to try 100 different things, which all collapse into one incoherent mess of a game. I suppose I recommend this game only because the length is short enough that you can actually complete it before being fed up with its many issues, and I think it is worth at least $10, so pick it up in the next sale.","March 29, 2014","true","10.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Even though I do recommend trying it out I have to say the game comes up short.  What I mean is that it has all the makings of a really amazing game but they just don't quite come through.\n\nIt has an awesome two-bladed brawling system with lots of options to mix up the combat, and a dashing system that allows you to move at incredible speeds, but there is no targeting system so it's easy to end up swinging or moving the wrong directions.\n\nIt has a third person shooter mode that allows you to break up the monotony of combat, but there is no cover system that allows you to take full advantage of this and switching between the combat modes is extremely frustrating.\n\nThe camera can be controlled, but if you are not actively controlling it then it wanders into the worst possible positions, and odds are that you don't have a free thumb to be manipulating it.\n\nThere's a decent story line that seems to be going on but it has no solid presentation to it, so we are stuck watching the conflicts between these various factions from one character's perspective and we hardly know what their motives even are.  All we really know is that Ayumi wants to get out of Dragonland (original) preferably with some treasure.  Everyone else just seems to want to kill you and that's all that seem relevant.\n\nThere is an upgrade system but it's largely unsatisfying.  Your basic skills remain largely the same you mostly just build on your magic.\n\nThe controls were not prioritized well and many functions just won't work at critical moments.  I almost think that the programmers thought that this should be the central idea for the final boss fight.  The game is challenging but some of the challenges feel like they went the whole wrong way.\n\nThere is some intense challenges in this game, but sometimes you'll just get stumped on what do, like when you encounter the Slasher on the Skydock.  You'll end up dead and then looking at the screen wondering where you went wrong.\n\nIn all, Blades of Time feels like a pretty good game with a REALLY AWESOME game trying to get out.  It mixes combat systems in a really cool way, but doesn't polish them to make them shine.  It gives us a story, but can't be bothered for good presentation.  It gives us controls that work except when it decides not to.  It give us puzzles and challenges with very little feedback on how things should be done.  In short, it needs a lot of work.\n7/10.","October 9, 2015","true","14.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Not sure, how long it will take, but I think ~60% of the game is already complete. Actually in this game you don't have to do so much. Spam that left mouse button, and use skills when you can. BUT, that would be realy easy, and kinda boring. So what about giving it a twist? Making enemies almost invicible, so you really have to use that time rewind mechanic, whit which you can make multiple clones of yourself. Sounds great, and not that hard. But what if I say, clones will last only for the moment you used time rewind before, so you have will need perfect timing for it. Now, it starts to become interesting, because I really like challanging, puzzlish games. But thinking stops here. If you realize how you can beat a certain type of enemy, or Boss, it become really boring and repetitive. Doing the same thing 3 or 4 times in a raw is basically just boring. So that's about fight system, which I actually like, but find a little undone (there was much more potential in it). About the other things, just in a few words: cool voice acting (there is japanese voice too, which I found the best :D), there are also boobs, a blonde, good looking protagonist with badass swords, that only make her better, and an interesting story, which I will surely finish, when I will get the hang of some repetitive fights. Buy it at discount, or if you are hyped about then buy it. I would give it 5/7.

My controls would no longer work and I had to completely alt-f4 then reload the game back up.\n\nI breezed through the bosses, I was playing on normal and now that I have hard mode unlocked I assume It will get more challenging.\n\nAll in all I would definitely reccomend this game, but not at full price.

Besides spinning your blades through enemies, you get some magic acting very similar to each other, making them insultingly boring; fire blast is akin to ice blast, fire cube is akin to ice cube, and so on. When hitting enough enemies/air you get a prompt for doing a finish move which also seems half-a$$ed and not at all satisfying to pull off. Game felt very "meh" at this point, but I decided to give it a little more of my time.\n\nPushing on, the game unfortunately disappointed more and more, and turned to complete and utter tedious garbage midway through. After a while, you have to use a "magic sphere" to kill enemies that are only visible and combatable inside this sphere you have to create over and over again every few metres. Enemies jump in and out of this sphere, making the already mediocre combat become super-frustrating and oh-my-god so tedious. There is also a "rewind time"-gimmick which is just as awful as it sounds, making the combat a big mess, and not the funny and enjoyable kind. Accompanied with inane puzzles, it was more than I could stand anymore.\n\nYour game or even bundle buying money is better spent on a pack of Juicy Fruit - its taste and enjoyment will last you a longer time than will Blades of (boring) Time.","December 12, 2015","false","15.4"," 32 of 61 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","32","61","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/208670/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","TL:DR – Third person hack and slash game similar to Darksiders, but very linear. There’s no significant backtracking, and all the puzzles are pretty easy to solve. You can beat the game in less than 10 hours. Technically, it has RPG elements but is extremely simplified.\n\nIn Blades of Time you play the treasure hunter Ayumi, a scantily clad, double sword wielding fighter who can kill a whole room full of armed men but can still occasionally act like Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider reboot (whiny and afraid). It’s hard to blame her though because after trying to crash her way into a mythical treasure trove, she and her sidekick Zero (a big buff dude) get thrown into Dragonland. Now separated from Zero, you (as Ayumi) need to find your way through the monster infested Dragonland back to your own world. No, Dragonland doesn’t have any dragons for you to fight, but there are a variety of creeps itching to take a bite out of all your exposed skin.\n\nGameplay wise, Blades of Time is a third person melee game where you can just mash the attack button and Ayumi will swing her swords like a ninja commando slashing everyone around her. However, unlike games such as Darksiders or Devil May Cry, the enemies aren’t really “stunned” by your hits and can still attack you even as they’re flinching from your strikes. Your attacks don’t interrupt them.  Fortunately you have a short range dash/dodge move that you can use to evade enemy attacks. One thing I noticed is that either the enemies all have a lot of health or your sword strikes are really weak, because killing enemies takes a lot more hits than you would expect.  Seriously, it takes like 20-30 hits to kill anything with your swords. You do have a rifle to shoot baddies with though, and that seems to be pretty strong.\n\nI said before that the game is simplified, and this applies to character development and equipment. You don’t “level up” in the game, and you don’t collect money to buy items with either. As you progress through the story, you “find” new skills or upgrades to your existing ones. They’re unmissable so don’t worry about not finding an awesome spell. All of your equipment upgrades are found using a homing compass that also guides you on which direction you should be traveling. The equipment is missable, but none of it is game changing. They all just boost 1 of your skills, and nothing else (no +armor or +damage). There are only a few magic spells for you to use (fire, ice, and a heavy blast) but they add a little variety to your gameplay. They’re not especially strong either though.\n\nProbably your greatest tool (and the reason for the game’s title) is your ability to reverse time for a short period. During the time reversal, enemies and your past self will re-enact what happened a few seconds ago. During this window you can attack the enemy with your clone for a double or even triple attack (if you reverse time in the middle of another time reversal). This is also used for puzzle solving since there are some areas that you can’t progress without hitting 2 switches at the same time (stand on switch 1 and reverse time, then stand on switch 2 while your clone is still on switch 1).\n\nPros:\n+Simple gameplay and no “research” needed. Don’t worry about character building.\n+The game runs smoothly despite having nice graphics for a fantasy world with magic and monsters. My computer didn’t even heat up very much.\n\nCons:\n-If you’re looking for an in-depth RPG like Dragon age, or a loot game like Diablo, Blades of Time isn’t the game for you. Also, the game’s “dialogue” is kind of weird. I don’t know if it’s translated from another language or just badly written at times.\n-There is this really annoying bug involving getting your spell casting “stuck” that requires a game restart to fix. It happens a lot in boss battles, and at first I didn’t even realize it was a bug. I thought I had a keyboard button jammed or something. It occurs when an enemy interrupts one of your magic spells.\n-The Outbreak multiplayer option plays like a third person MOBA but there’s nobody playing online. Don’t get this game for the multiplayer.\n\nOverall, the game is fun to spend a weekend on, especially if you just want brainless hack and slash without worrying about exploring huge areas or backtracking. You also get to fight large boss monsters and earn some easy Steam achievements. 7/10\n","April 14, 2015","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's how I would explain this game to you. The rewinding mechanics allows you to work with your clone(s) to finish off enemies and bosses or solve puzzles. The puzzle aspect doesn't really fit the game, but hey, it works I guess. Think 'standing on switches' and things like that.\nThen there's the weapon and ability upgrading which is pretty extensive.\nThe graphics are pretty good; I was actually surprised by how good it looked in motion. Your main character looks great (but forgettable), with the ponytails and all (woohoo, <3 ponytails !). The voice acting, however, is a bit cheesy. Mmyeah, that was to be expected I guess.\nBut since I'm not really into the mindless action these games offer (I do enjoy them from time to time) I stopped before finishing it. No, I'm not ashamed of it.

The stories nothign special in my opinion and is extremely linear but it's still very enjoying without paying too much attention to it and there are a few moments where the game doesn't properly exdplain what needs doing to get past or to defeat a certain enemy but a quick look at a walk through can get you straight back into hacking and slashing the crap out of everything again in no time!\n\nI personally wouldn't pay full price for this game myself, but if you see it on sale and enjoy fast paced hack and slash games then you should definitely give it a go!","September 19, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The feel is similar to God of War, but somewhat less epic.  Combat is mostly straightforward - heavy on mashing the LMB, light on complex combo sequences - but the gradual addition of unlockable abilities adds enough tactical options to keep the fights engaging.\n\nThe big selling point to Blades of Time is the "Time Rewind" mechanic that allows you to stay in place while rewinding time by a few seconds, allowing you to team up with your past self to defeat difficult enemies or solve puzzles.  It's a minor innovation that pales after a few uses, and I quickly found myself eschewing the mechanic in favour of good old button-mashing mayhem, except when faced with bosses and puzzles that demanded it.\n\nGameplay is very linear; you're pretty-much marched down one continuous corridor from mob fight, to puzzle area, to boss arena and onwards.  That particular sin is typical of this genre, though, and when such games do give you the freedom to revisit past areas (as in Darksiders) it doesn't really add much to the gameplay, anyway.\n\nOverall, this is a solid, workmanlike offering.  There have definitely been titles I enjoyed more (the God of War series outstanding among them,) but the failure to achieve excellence shouldn't detract from the fact that this is a very playable package with no serious flaws.\n\nAnd yes, the protagonist is a busty young woman who wears very little clothing.

The game, however, puts simple pressure plates all over the place, which gets boring quick.\n\nWith better narrative and more variety in terms of puzzles, Blades of Time could have been a real gem and an instant recommendation to anyone.\n\nIt's definitely no Devil May Cry or God of War, but for fans of the hack 'n slay genre, it's a decent addition to their library.","January 4, 2013","true","8.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Whenever a female character is presented in a certain way, there is always the suspicion that the developers are trying to sell a game based on that presentation. While I dislike that cynical view, it isn't like it came from nothing, sadly.\n\nThat said, this game has some interesting combat mechanics, and overall, I found the combat fairly enjoyable. The most notable element is a sort of time-rewind mechanic, but the way this works is it leaves a clone of you that does whatever it was that you did up to the point you started rewinding time. They use this well in puzzles, and it adds quite a bit to combat, allow for you to unleash intense burst damage. There is also a sort of magic system that works very well for this sort of action game. Basically, attacking enemies builds up a meter that allows you to use magic at certain points. It also gives you an extra-health potion (essentially) when it overflows.\n\nThe story is OK, the dialog is often cringeworthy (though I felt it was more from the writing than the voice acting personally, others may feel differently, though). The locations are varied and interesting enough.\n\nAlso, for some reason, there is basically a MOBA mode, not unlike that random Guilty Gear MOBA. I have no idea why, and I find it most perplexing.\n\nTo recap:\n+ Solid Combat\n+ Interesting Time Mechanic\n+ Nice Locations\n= OK Plot\n= Random MOBA mode?\n- Bad Dialog","December 5, 2015","true","9.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/recommended/208670/","tmcookiez","<™[-=> Cookiez <=-]™>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/","177 products in account","This game is one of those hidden gems. It's not perfect but it's similar to playing a game like Soul Reaver, Darksiders, Castlevania or Devil May Cry. You play as Ayumi, a treasure hunter who is looking for the treasure of Dragonland. The only way to get to Dragonland is by using the Sphere owned by the secret Guild. So, Ayumi and her partner, Zero bash into the guild and use the sphere to force teleport to Dragonland. In Dragonland, you meet the Chaos Keeper Statues and the Dragon Spirit of Time and then the story begins.\n\nI must say that this game is on the way towards improving itself, I think Gaijin Entertainment (Russian developer) & Konami can probably get better. It's a failed remake of X-blades but worth trying it on sale. ($3.99)\n\nThere is a major gamebreaking control bug in the last boss. It caused me to be unable to complete the game. Due to its severity, I had to change my vote to vote this game down.\n\n\nPROS\n1. Gun and Sword style fighting\nIt's exactly like playing the beat-them-up games.\n\n2. Quick To Learn\nIt's super easy to pick up if you've played other beat-them-up games.\n\n3. The Teleporter\nVery nice design. I like the way you made it spin before teleportation.\n\n4. Sunlight is Deadly\nI like the idea. Not being able to fight in intense solar radiation.\n\n5. Skyguards\nNice idea too.\n\n6. Different Guns / Swords\nNice to know the inventory work differently.\n\n7. The Time Warping\nAlso cool. Especially when you have to piece together a puzzle to kill a creature. I would have preferred more time powers instead of just rewind.\n\n8. Rocket Launcher\nA pity that you are forced to drop it whenever you jump. This is most ridiculous.\n\n9. Executions\nLove the way it's quickly executed, even in mid air or mid combat. There is a slight graphics twitch but it's acceptable.\n\n10. Aerial Combat\nI love the way you can dash to an enemy and slash him to bits.\n\n11. Creativity\nFloating corals? Dying Sun planet? Sky Island? Nice.\n\nCONS\n1. Lame Names\nDragonland? Blades of Time?\n\n2. Exact Copy\nIt's just way too similar to the other beat them up games.\na. Speed Dash\nb. Dash Grab\nc. Air Dash\nd. Range / Melee combo\ne. Double Jump\n\nAt least, improve on them.\n\n3. Bad Marketing\nThe team didn't advertise this game well when it was released.\n\n4. Enemies are Carbon Copies\nYou will see the same enemy in the same Verne model over and over again. The only difference is the top hat. E.g. The mercenaries.\n\n5. No Cities\nNo rest stops, no shops, just chop chop chop. No additional nuggets of information and lore.\n\n6. Rocket Launcher\nIt drops when you jump or dash. It's a very silly balance mechanic to prevent you from carrying it over to another location.\n\n7. Graphics\nPretty mediocre. Honestly, there is nothing interesting to look at.\n\n8. Chaos Slasher\nThat's the Dahaka from Prince of Persia.\n\n9. Floating Coral Grabs\nThey are the same as grabbing lights in Devil May Cry or Darksiders.\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n1. Special Attack Styles\nLook at Alice (American McGee) for more details on how to design.\n\n2. More Weapons\nI've played the Darksider series and I think more weapons would increase the variety.\n\n3. Flipover / Slide Under\nThe Prince of Persia series allows you to flip over an opponent. I think this would be a great addition to the movements Ayumi can do. A slide under in between the legs of an enemy would be great too.\n\n4.

The voice acting was mediocre. The action was fast-paced and had an interesting idea behind it, but it ended up getting very boring a couple hours in. A normal fight would just be spamming (on a gamepad) X with the occasional dodge to avoid getting hit and very rarely using one of the abilities that you have to spam X to be able to use. The story seemed to be okay from what I have completed so far.

I say "potentially" because if it weren't for the massive framerate drop during the entire game, the repetiive enemies, the uninteresting characters, predictable gameplay, terrible platforming, and the puzzles, I would say this would be a buy instead of a rent.  Despite being "Limited Edition" version, all that is "limited" is an extra level which you play as a different character...which should've been an option from the start.  (Why is it that "Limited Editions" are the "complete package" again?)  The idea of having your avatar go back in time to use your past selves to fight alongside your present version is a great gameplay mechanic, especially when used in the right way such as fighting enemies.  The main problem is, like any other hack-and-slash game, this mechanic is often pushed to the side or being thought of as a secondary option for combat rather than being the focus.  The enemies are repetitive, making the gameplay predictable as you will be forced into implementing the same strategy to defeat the same enemy over and over again, which doesn't add much to the "time" mechanic when you think about it.  The game tries to give you a break from combat to do some puzzles, but they are not very exciting and are WAY too easy to complete (I hate puzzles anyway).  The only challenging level was the desert level where if you touch the hot sand, you will die, forcing you to use the shade as a literal cover.  No other game I know of has a creative level like that!  Also, the characters are so bland, and the main charcter Ayumi NEVER SHUTS UP!  Always with the complaining!  Other M syndrome, anyone?  Finally, the controls are VERY clunky.  The jumping mechanic is especially annoying and tedious because when you jump, you either automatically "bounce" or slide before you come to a complete halt, and it makes the platforming sections all the more frustrating.  This is something MANY modern platforming games whether 2D or 3D shouldn't be doing.  In the end, Blades of Time has the potential to be something more, but in the meantime, I suggest renting this game instead of buying it.","February 9, 2015","false","20.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Long stretches of just running around the scenery(extremely linear) interrupted by occasional fights and popping the compass to find hidden treasures (which sounds alot more exciting than it actually is)\n\nMultiplayer is dead and playing Outbreak mode by yourself gets old pretty quickly too.\n\nAll in all this game gets barely a 4/10 from me and not recommended unless your main goal is staring at the protagonists ♥♥♥, which is fine as long as you realize the game itself is crap.","January 13","false","5.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

Sounds effects are great too.\n\nThe most exciting part of the game is building up your rage bar (special attack) when fighting menacing looking bosses, or even slashing up hundreds of enemies in the "outbreak" mode.

I know a friend who won't get games that are lower than certain ratings, games that are not really AAA titles, I could understand where he is coming from, I know there are many option out there, why waste time and money on something that has mixed reviews.  But I'm glad I played this and didn't miss out on it even this game has somewhat mixed reviews.\n\nThis seems to be one of those games that have many little flaws.  The story writing seems like a mess, and the ending almost feel like this is one of those movie or tv series that they just run out of budget at the end.  The voice acting(English one at least) is horrible I think, and the soundtrack is uninspiring.\n\nAside with all those little flaws,  I truly think the gameplay is awesome.  I like the control of it very much(but not when the protagonist is using a gun).  I like how the protaganist dash, or slash, it all feel very smooth, and very powerful.  And I got through the game because I have so much fun hacking and slashing away.\n\nThe puzzle in this type of game is easy, and I think this is how it should be for this genre of game,  I know there are some hack and slash game that has difficult and sometimes illogical puzzles....Seriously, if I want to play hack and slash game, I want it to be as brainless as possible, or else I would play some crazy puzzling point and click adventure game or something.\n\nIf this game didn't have the flaws that I mentioned, it wouldn't have been one of the most underated game I think.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed playing it, because it was fun.

The controls are a little weird at first but once you customize and get used to them there's a lot of exploring, fighting and gun play around the corner, the story unfolds pleasantly and the different landscapes are very beautiful to watch. Also, the innovative time travel feature which basically allows you to replay at the same moment that your double(s) are doing the original action(s) to kill difficult hordes of enemies or solve more complex puzzle that require you to be in multiple places at the same time. Sounds confusing? Time travel always is, but despite it's complications it's definetly recommended for casual adventure gaming!\n\nMultiplayer: It's a real shame you can't play with at least 4 players at the same time because the defense/attack principle with a base works really well.\n\nDismal Swamp DLC: Very short and not very challenging but still fun as it shifts the game's focus from puzzles and special abilities to simple hack and slash and shooting survival mode.\n\nPS: The game is easy to find on certain bundles or on sale so don't pay more than 10 bucks!

Not necessarily the bosses, because they all have a certain weakness that you must figure and exploit, usually with your Rewind Spell (just recall the name of the game) - What is annoying is that certain actions can be unresponsive at times; I died a lot while platforming through the gauntlet after you meet Michelle and leave the crashed ship.\n\nThe worst part in this game (besides the ending –“Oh that (horrible thing) happened… END.”) was leaving that ship: the way in which you do it, and characters' responses to it... I've seriously never felt more bad-weird (or bad-wrong (badong)) because of something in a video game than I did in that moment.\n\nThe direction detection when, say, attempting to counter enemy attacks, and especially when having to use the Sphere of Order to move the energy through the conduits to activate a Portal (O.o) - when combined with the (at times) otherwise clunky/stiff controls… Platforming and fighting  can  become painful to go through (I shuddered at the thought of Hard mode, but your Powers carry over and by that time, you’ll have a much better feel for the mechanics).\nUSE.A.CON.TROLL.ER. Be precise in pushing the stick in the correct direction; it’s as simple as that.\nRegarding that Sphere of Order comment: A lot of the puzzles in the game, though (theoretically at least) logical and very demanding mentally – I was reduced to spamming and ignorant trial-and-error until I passed them because I didn’t understand the logic, because the methods for manipulating the puzzles weren’t very, er, intuitive.\n\nMore often than not, the game recognizes its own shortcomings/bvllsh!t and has a generous auto-save function. There aren't even any load times to speak of when doing so; the worst part is when you auto-load into a segment that has characters talking (my buddy had all the voices muted, which is worth considering, though it’s the writing (I would guess the translation, actually) more than anything that is turrible).\n\nSo. For all the game's faults and lack of polish. I still recommend Blades of Time.\n\nThe universe in the game is too amazing to allow something like, er, mediocrity (incredibly good mediocrity) to discourage – comparable to Kingdoms of Amalur in artistic style. What I mean by “mediocrity” is, in terms of, er, game design/execution, it feels like an incredible indie title/a flop from a AAA studio; the combat is pretty good, the concepts and mechanics are interesting, the story is serviceable - the way it all comes together seems *meh*.\nIf someone has done/will do a Youtube series on it, you MIGHT be better off just checking that out...\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nMultiplayer... “Outbreak” is amazing; the main reason for my recommendation.\nThird-person hack 'n' slash moba.\n\n\nThe statements:\nI cannot get into moba's.\nHack 'n' slash's: nothing special.\n\nThe bad:\nThe form of moba present in BoT is incredibly watered down, to the point that any who play such games would probably take offense at Blades' attempt to meld the genre with third-person hack 'n' slash, and to leave it so barebones (relatively).\nThe unintuitive control schemes are glaring when Bosses/Champions spawn (pumping a Skyguard full with your rifle and then being unable to dodge appropriately because your character didn't put their gun away in time sucks)(adapt and figure the nuances - it’s not actually  solely  because of the game’s awkwardness).\nToo few maps (even though one of the DLC’s added another map).\n\nThe good:\nIncredibly fun and addicting - if I was to ever get into a moba, it would be because of the transition that BoT would have served. If you have a friend whom you’re trying to get into a moba, I would recommend both of y’all to play this game; to introduce them to the basic concepts of the genre while keeping the actual gameplay simple as a hack ‘n’ slash. You can even run the multiplayer solo and it's still incredible.\n\nWhat's interesting is that any gear you acquire in the Campaign is carried over into Outbreak and vice versa (thus, there ARE duplicates and clearly superior gear, which could be seen as annoying). The maps look pretty big according to the minimap; at first you might be saddened at how little they are utilized. Treasure randomly spawns in the middle alleys - that is the reason for those alleys, totally neutral zones. Where the turrets spawn is random in the symmetrical maps; as the bigger maps, sometimes the turrets might spawn in the top-left quadrant, the next time in the bottom-right.\n\n\nLinear Maps:\nA desert in which the sun saps your health quickly, so you must fight in the shade.\nA jungle that is very appropriately sized to accommodate the amount of turrets.\n\nSymmetrical Maps:\nA swamp in which the most difficult grunts reside.\nA series of floating islands that allows you to “push” your opponent (in versus) off the map.\nA mountain pass filled with lava that looks like something out of LotR.\n\n\nYou start the matches with your choice of three powers/passives (Fire or Frost, Heavy Strike and Rage Saving are the best). You gain experience (resets every match); whenever you die, you get to put those experience levels towards more powers.\nI don't understand why you can't do so without dying; apparently, it's the game's way of consoling you upon your death.\nJust as Treasure randomly spawns, Bosses do too; spawn rates for these *expletives* increases exponentially with each difficulty, as does their strength (playing as Michelle, I swear that I've been one-shotted several times because an Invisible Assassin touched me... wasn't even facing me, just touched me)(Ayumi is beast, Zero is a little too slow).\n\nHow the progression works:\nYou gain Runes from Treasure and from Match Bonuses. There are Challenges you complete to earn Medals.\nCollections of Runes have passive effects (i.e. if you’re co-opping, whenever your partner opens a Chest, you also get a Rune); you complete Formulas with Medals – Formulas grant new gear (which, also, usually just grant passive effects, though more combat-oriented).\n\n=================================================\nBEAR IN MIND that I got my copy for stupid cheap through Humble Bundle.\nFor the asking price? This game is really not worth it.\n\n*****VERDICT:*****\nA SIDEWAYS THUMB SKEWED UPWARD","January 2, 2015","true","31.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics are pretty good in some areas, but textures are painful in others. The Story is near incomprehensible. The voice acting, rather the script writing, is laughable. The gameplay consists largely of walking towards an enemy and clicking the mouse until its dead. Occassionally you might throw a spell in there or jump or shoot a gun, but pretty much just clicking will take care of 90% of your problems. There were some decent puzzles....about 2 of them. The time rewind feature was woefully underutilized. Inventory doesnt really matter as no matter what you have equipped, just keep clicking the mouse and you will eventually get there. The boss fights did have a bit of strategy to them, I'll give it that, but anytime you can time rewind, simply pull out the machine gun and time rewind 5 clones to all shoot at the same time and anything will die in about 10 seconds. Its not a bad game at all, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed parts of it, but can I reccommend you spend your money on it? No.\n\nThis is an example of a game that got the bigger parts right but is let down by the details.\n\n5/10","February 20, 2015","false","11.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sort of. The game is good over-all the combat is pretty fast-paced, the level design was great. Locations deliver that very "fantastical" sort of idea that, that kind of world would only exist in a dream. I haven't gotten that far into the game yet, considering the amound of time I've played before writing this review (about less than an hour). I feel though that I've gotten enough things to cringe about in Blades of Time.\n\nOne, the animations. Man... I don't exactly understand the whole dynamic as to why this is a problem in the first place but, considering I know just a tad bit about animation, is that every movement takes a TON of time. Walk cycles are the worst when trying to animate by hand, without a mocap device. Anyways, I noticed one big peeve of mine for BoT: Ayumi's running  cycle. If you don't pay much attention to it, it looks decent enough to make a big deal out of it. But, what I notice is that with every step, her head just turns with her body. 95% of the time she's looking left and right and rarely to the front. I see myself already in the future when I play the game and just have those long running sequences I'll just get constantly bothered by the fact that she can't look at one damn direction when she's running. I thought it sort of made sense at first since, she was in a completely new world and she wanted to just take as much of its beauty in as possible. But nope, just a damn animation problem. I don't think it would have taken much to lock her head relatively in the same position as she's moving: forward. It shouldn't take much precision either, as long as it's in approximately the same location the whole time, it should be flawless. Another problem that I have with her running is her arms and legs. She flails her legs outward while keeping her knees in so she sort of pushes her body in a diagonal direction (which may explain why she keeps turning her damn head, although probably not). It's hard to describe for me through text but just look up gameplay and I'm sure you"d understand. Also her arms are kept way too close to her body for her to even look like she's running comfortably. Her arms, instead of moving forward and back while she runs, they more rotate around her body in a sort of elbow-to-chest-then-to-shoulder-blade movement. Ridiculous I know, but I'm not known for being good at describing things.\n\nSecond, the narrative that Ayumi does. THE CONSTANT NARRATIVE. I swear after every minor part, she's going to speak her mind about either the world or what she thinks about the new enemies she'll encounter. It becomes a bit of an annoyance. Again, I'm still not that far into the game, maybe that'll change but, we'll see. Also the way the game gives you hints about how to progress the level is... I don't know. Compared to other games, the way the hint is either presented or shown, it sort-of makes me feel idiotic. Like, I could have figured that out all by myself? Yet, that's all based on opinion and I don't want to force you to believe me on that point. But let's look at the wider aspect, the voice acting itself. It's pretty good, to say the least. The only problem I'd have is with Ayumi's narration, sometimes it's very noticeable that she's reading off of a script rather than being immersive into the BoT world. I'll update my opinion once I've finished the game.\n\nLast, the shooting mechanics. It's too locked for me. Like, I'm moving on an axes instead of fluid mouse motion. Also the way Ayumi moves when in "Gun Mode" is way too smooth. She's basically sliding on the ground rather than walking when she's aiming. I feel like there'd need to be some sort of bobbing motion while you move to at least make the game feel just a tad bit more, normal? I'd say? The movement is too mechanic rather than fluid. But I could also incorporate this with my first point but I'm too lazy to care (heheh..)\n\nOverall I'd say this game is playable if you don't pay attention to much of the details in which I've pointed out thus far. It's got a pretty promising story line, fast-paced combat, awesome level, character, and monster design (no it's not because the main character looks attractive, although in my opinion it's sort of wierd to say she is, since... I don't know I guess you'll have to see it for yourself and establish your own decision), pretty good sountrack too! Well yeah, I'd say a 7 out of 10. I got the game off of a bundlestars bundle so if you want to pick the game up? I'd say you'd get your money's worth if you got it through that, and hey, you'll get 7 extra games that you most likely will not play along with it. But for $4.01? I'd say it's worth a shot.","February 4, 2014","true","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, it comes to rely on this a bit too much. While there are plenty of puzzles to solve, great graphics and entertaining gameplay, the story (complete with full voice acting!) falls short about mid-way through the game.  Several encounters begin to feel forced and the gimmic of the game begins to really show.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really, really liked this game.  Until about 70% complete.  It's definitely worth playing through the first time and the gameplay is fun while the art pulls you in.  It feels like the love child of Kingdom Hearts and Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, but without the tremendous story to fall back on.  This game is a terrific find when on sale, but it just doesn't have enough hutzpah to keep me completely in love and justify a full price purchase.","March 28, 2014","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Instead you will encounter new more powerful enemies!\n\nSo you have this great gameplay and good graphics, what's bad? To be honest nothing unless you are really negative against japanese names on blonde girls running around showing off alot of skin. The protagonist is called ayumi and in the beginning she is running around in almost nothing for clothes! But unlike other games were you progress as a girl you gain more armor by having less armor this game actually gives you new outfits that covers ayumis whole body and to be honest they look REALLY good. So if you can look past her name and her first outfit  this is a great hack and slash game! The environment is rich aswell and really breathtaking aswell.\n\nNow for the last thing. Is it WORTH the money?\nThe answer is both yes and no. It's good so I would recommend you buying it but it's not so good that I'm going to force you to buy it now this instant. Intead I suggest that you wait for it to show up on a steam sale or a partner webpage that have some sweet offers daily.\n\npoints: 8/10 (Could be alot worse but it shows what type of people the developers are and some people just doesn't like it therefore the 8.)","April 8, 2014","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game knows it has a good idea because it abuses the time feature trick a bit too much, and like a kid wanting attention, you’ll just get fed up with it being in your face all the time. I did have fun with the game – there’s something about it that made me enjoy just hacking down some fools with my clones in fancy fashion, even if the rest of the combat is a little flat and basic. In the end though, all the problems pull it down and make Blades of Time a game that can be fun to play at times, but nothing more. If you don’t mind that, you might be one of the people that Ayumi is just looking for, because I can’t see her finding many fans with her latest treasure hunt.","December 26, 2013","true","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I will keep it as short and simple as possible:\n\nPro:\n-Gorgeous Environments, for the most part.\n-An (also for the most part) decent voice acting in all available languages (japanese best tho.)\n-Large Variety of Enemies with some fresh ideas\n-Good Animations\n-Nice Time Rewind Mechanic\n-Actually fun puzzling\n-A decent fighting system with awesome magic skills...\n\n\nCon:\n-...which sadly lacks ANY impact in normal swordfighting (not magic) due to horrible sound effects and just not really good audiovisual feedback. Seriously, for the most part it sounds like you would try to rub cardboard swords against a cardboard enemy. Often you can't tell if your attacks stagger an enemy or if he attacks back.\n-The controls, while fluid for the most part, just infuriate sometimes. WHY does the character stop after a jump, so you have to wait a second to run on? That just doesn't fit the gameplay. Same with dashing.\n-Some annoying glitches (rare though. I clipped through the ground twice, which is not gamebreaking but annoying.)\n-Horrible, horrible...HORRIBLE cutscenes. The characters move and act like paper. The voice acting, like stated in pro, is alright though.\n-While, like stated in pro, the environments and enemies are often enjoyable and lush, there are WAY too many muddy textures that should just not have been there. It really drags down the otherwise beautiful scenery.\n\nIn the end it is still recommendable if you can overlook the lacking impact of fighting and some of the above issues. It is still fun, and while you will often shake your head about issues, the game is still...just, fun. Simple fun that the issues won't take away - luckily.\n\nPersonal Score: 7,5/10","February 14, 2014","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even with everything on high.\nControls: The controls feel sluggish, it sometimes doesn't react when you press the keys on your keyboard.\nCamera: The mouse acceleration is so bad that it's hard to control the camera. (Looking around, shooting things and hitting things in general) (Can't seem to fix)\nEnemies + Boss battles: Enemies can be hard to hit due to the camera and some of them are pretty fast so you will take some hits from those enemies.\nStory: There's not really a story... You want to find a treasure and... that's it.\nVoice acting: FREAKIN' AWFUL!\nCrashes: The game crashes sometimes when pressing the inventory key.\n\nDo not buy this game.

I literally muted the voice just to make it somewhat bareable, but I had the subtitles on and it didn't help.

The plot, writing, and voice acting are absolutely terrible. It's kind of like when you watch a bad movie with your friends just to make fun of it the whole time. Pretty much exactly like House of the Dead 1 and 2 in terms of a good bad game.\n\nThe actual gameplay is pretty good. Kind of reminds me of the spam of Dynasty Warriors in the setting of Devil May Cry little level arenas. It also has some Prince of Persia style time rewind puzzles. It even has a little FPS stance you can switch to and just headshot all the things, and a cute little reload cancel quick switch to go with it. The visuals aren't too shabby either, pretty nice actually. The graphics do seem a bit dated, and it does feel like this game is years older than it actually it, but it was still a pretty nice bad game. There is an Outbreak mode too, which is basically DoTa style hack and slash, but good luck finding a pug game as multiplayer is basically dead.\n\nVery solid buy for the lulz. Kind of reminds me of Prototype 2 in terms of good gameplay, horrible characters/voices/story.

I'd describe it as a cross between Bayonetta and Tomb Raider - it's a hack-n-slash by nature but it also has a third-person shooter element, and you can switch between these modes on the fly, which I find to be a really interesting addition - it allows for a unique take on both genre's formulas, and contrary to what you might think, in the midst of a fight flicking between the modes feels rather natural - it almost feels as if the game encourages you to use both in tandem to achieve your goal.\n\nIn hack and slashes of this game's type, combos tend to be both essential and, for a gamer like me, rather hard to pull off. Blades of Time remedies this a little - whereas in a game like Bayonetta the combos would be a ridiculous string of button presses, Blades of Time has relatively simple button combos, press one button to ready, press another to attack. In that sense I found myself enjoyng the game a lot more, because I didn't really need to worry about all the ridiculous combos I'd have to pull off - While a more hardcore hack-n'-slash fan might not find this appealing, I personally think it's a nice touch, making the game easy to jump in and out of without needing pinpoint-precise button presses.\n\nI have but two criticisms of this game: First, the english voice acting is pretty bad, though this is remedied by simply switching the voice language to Japanese, and second, the story makes absolutely no sense - the game goes straight from the title screen into the opening cutscene without a shred of explanation as to what is going on. However, when you're in the thick of it, hacking and slashing and shooting and magicking enemies like there's no tomorrow, you honestly forget about these errors, because you're just having too much fun to really care.\n\nOverall, despite its shortcomings, Blades of Time is a lot of fun, and an interesting fusion of the hack & slash and third-person shooter genres, and I'd reccommend this game if you were a fan of either genre. An underrated gem, this game has enough action to keep you entertained for a long time.","December 14, 2014","true","2.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Fast fighting fun in a very pure, uncompromised and likeable way. A solid selection and variety of moves, an interesting time-rewind feature to overwhelm enemies with multiple copies of oneself and solve basic button-press puzzles, nicely designed enemies, varied, beautifully designed and memoreable levels, a great soundtrack, a not necessarily revolutionary but nevertheless somewhat interesting story (it needs time to build up, but when it does it takes pretty epic shapes), increasingly likeable characters, a pretty good voice acting and big numbers of lines. It runs fast and smooth, the controls are easy (I played with an XBOX controller) and I picked it up very cheaply in a bundle. For which I feel like a thief now. I think I'm gonna buy one or another copy for the full price just because it seems that this game is a severly underrated gem.\n\nThere is even an online versus mode as well as a mildly strategic single- and multiplayer co-op arena tower defense mode with leveling and item mechanics and stuff. In other games I would usually see such a multiplayer mode sceptical, but as the singleplayer portion of this game is already great enough I think this is pretty awesome to have. I played the co-op mode once with a Japanese and it worked (which is not self-evident in such games). I didn't notice severe lags or synchronisation issues despite the distance to the host. We (well, I at least) had a blast. I didn't understand all he said over his mic because I don't speak Japanese, but we ran over tons of monsters and my screen was all slash and boom and peng and pow.\n\nA few platforming sections I died in more often than I probably had to because the double-jump from the protagonist is not the most precise. There are some platforming and trap-evading parts where someone else might get a little frustrated, but I got through okay and the checkpoints in this game seem pretty fair.\n\nAlso, the story and character relationships can be a little confusing. Some good thoughts went into it, that's for sure, there are lore hinches that I liked. In the end everything gets resolved fairly well, but in the middle the game sometimes lost me a bit. I don't know if that is because I didn't play the prequel "X-Blades" (which I sure will too soon). But, as mentioned, it finds a satisfying and understandable end.","December 20, 2014","true","9.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I was wrong, i can admit that.\n\nFirst of all, the game has decent graphics, not awesome, but allright for a mid budget game. I have seen(heard) better voice acting, not game breaking, but it takes some points from the overall score.\n\nWhat is most important for me is the gameplay, which is what it made me decide to uninstall (not that ill never play it, but i will send it way back on the queue in my library). The mechanics are actually almost rock solid, jumps, attacks, everything reacts fine as it should there is almost as solid as God of war except for 1 little detail.\n\nwhen you use your attacks to test them, or against the air, well, you notice that you are hitting air. The problem is that when you hit an enemy or object, or the wall, you feel exactly the same, squat, nada. You cant feel the power behind your blows. You hit an enemy, you see that you are hitting them, yet you dont feel it on your control (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYEebRNb0ag  Minute 20 as an example, when he breaks a crate, then he hits a large enemy 10-15 seconds later).\n\nIn any hack/slash buttonmash game, when you hit an enemy, there is a proper reaction, either a combo hitcounter, some reaction of pain of the enemy, maybe slower attacks from your part. i dont know, something. In this game you feel like you are slashing leaves every single time,.\n\neven the old snes beat em ups got those things right. I could kept playing, the mechanics are solid enough, i could bear the voice acting, couldnt complain about the graphics neither or the frenetic camera (yeah, you can dash and the camera moves a bit violently) , its just that i felt that my mouseclicks were worthless. there is no epicness in this. It felt empty/weak.\n\nFor better understanding of what i am saying. Imagine you are playing street fighter. You get in CQC, you throw a fierce punch to your enemy in the face, you hitted him, you see his health bar going down, yet there was no proper animation, your fist just went trought his face, yet worse, since you didnt altered his animation he can actually counter, and you will see your character on the ground, less health, but you just never felt a thing.\n\nSo yes, small detail, game breaker for me. I wouldnt get this game unless it comes in a bundle or if its really cheap, less than 5 USD and i still would doubt it.\n\nAnd thats why i cant recommend the game, otherwise, this could be a little jewel.","February 13, 2014","false","0.3"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","10","24","0","0"

Take a huge dose of God of War, mix in a bit of Tomb Raider, add some guns, blend in loads of magic, add slow motion and time rewing etc. The list goes on and on...\n\nThe action is punctuated by some puzzles here and there, but these are all fairly easy to work out and most require you to use the time rewind mechanic.\n\nI think if some of the ideas were shelved and the game was a little more simple, then perhaps I could recommend it. As it is though it quickly becomes frustrating, there's just too much to worry about.","December 7, 2013","false","2.9"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

Like the cinematic looks epic in my opinion, but it makes absolutely no sense. There was an initiation to figure out who goes to Dragonland, then the bad guys the ones who seem bad come in and try to steal the sphere to Dragonland and the good guy just let's them take the sphere and go to Dragonland.\n\nI find this weird as it doesn't explain anything as to why they are going to Dragonland, why you play as the people who seem bad in the opening cinematic, why the good guy jus let the evil people have the sphere. It all makes no sense.\n\nThis may all be explained as I play more, but for now it's all confusing as hell. Which isn't good to make people confused before they even get to the main menu! But now onto my thoughts.\n\nThe Positive:\n♦ The scenery and graphics looked pretty cool and unique\n♦ The Platforming seemed cool\n♦ I like how everything is read to you\n♦ I like how the inventory is in the form of a handbook\n♦ The unqiueness of the enemies are cool and the number of different ones are awesome\n♦ I liked the combat style and the gun.\n♦ I liked the way you get spells\n♦ I like how you can press "E" on a nearly dead enemy to do a special and finish them\n♦ I like the idea of using a compass to find hidden objects and to find the main objective\n\nThe Negative:\n\n♦ The voice of your character was weird and annoying, some of the things she said was obvious beyond belief and unneeded.\n♦ Characters Face is messed up graphics wise\n♦ The story seems to start in the middle... as explained above with the openeing cinematic. It could be a mad story and well written... but it seems to leave major parts out. For example who is Zero, why is he so important, why are we going to Dragonland etc etc. It all just seems to start in the middle. It may explain more as I play... but they needed more backstory (I thought there was a prequel that I missed or something, but nope).\n♦ It seems Repetitive as. Go here, kill these, learn these, repeat.\n♦ I haven't come accross any puzzles yet... if they are supposed to puzzles then well uh, they suck beyond repair.\n♦ Whole game seems too easy\n♦ I dislike the timestop spell, don't get me wrong it's cool as it stops time, but to me it seems like they didn't implement it well to make use of it's coolness. It just seems to be there to make it almost near impossible to kill enemies with it.\n♦ Absolutely no challenges\n♦ I dislike how 90% of the game so far that I've played is go here, kill these enemies, oh look a wall, walk some more, step on a button, kill some more enemies, walk back the way you came and now the wall is open. Repeat.\n♦ Dislike the gun having unlimited ammo, this makes it way too easy and unrealistic.\n♦ Needs to be more weapon types and different guns to make it slightly more interesting\n♦ Spells are just given to you and are given pretty fast. They say you need to collect souls or something from enemies you destroy to unlock them, but the spells seemed to just be handed to you which is lame. It gives you no incentive to actually want to kill everything.\n♦ Spells seem pointless and not needed as you can easily kill enemies without them\n♦ The compass is cool but it's pointless as you can easily find everything without it. It doesn't add to the game anything you couldn't do without. Thus as cool as it is, it is pointless.\n\nGlitches:\n♦ At some points, I lost control to my spells, gun reloading and compass. The only way to fix this was to quit the game and re-open it. Really annoying.\n\nOn a whole the game in my opinion has awesomeness too it, don't get me wrong. Like the way you get and use spells, can dash to enemies, can find things with a compass, can stop time and the way you fight with meelee is awesome!\n\nAlthough that is all good, it is poorly implemented along with the storyline. TimeStop seems cool until you realize all it does is make you fight enemies for years, spells seems unneeded, the compass doesn't really help (You could find everythign without it) and learning to use spells as cool as it is, seems pointless when they are self explanitory things like fire, freeze, critical strike etc.\n\nI'd give it an overall raiting of 2.5/5.","October 11, 2014","false","10.7"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

Fairly good looking visuals with great gameplay, easy to learn and master.\n\nMultiplayer outbreak takes the idea of a MOBO and throws you into the action in third person mode, able to select multiple abilities and be able to upgrade them as you fight on in battle.\n\nGet enough rage, and you can blast away with your abilities. Go in blades-a-blazing or take the action from a distance with various different weapons, each of which has their own buffs to increase the chaos and carnage you deal. Light vs darkness, chaos versus order.\n\nCampaign mode takes you on an amazing adventure crossing paths with mechanical beast to broken ships to demons of darkness. Multiple unlockable skins for character and various different weapons to choose from as you progress. Blades of time is definitely a good game with balance for both guns and blades with awesome moves to go with it.\n\nOverall, Blades of time is a well rounded action game, with easy to learn gameplay mechanics, responsive and easy to learn controls.","February 3, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No, the reasons that I kept coming back was the most important thing in a game thing like this - the combat. It's quick and fluid, with a lot of enemies coming towards the player. That was just the first reason, the second one is the environments. Not a single level (there's ten in total) looks like the last one, so it will never get boring to fight the Chaos and the Skyguards.\n\nIf, by any chance, you're out looking for a good action game, this will do IF (!!!) you buy it when it's part of a sale or a bundle of some sort. When it's full price, I wouldn't go for it - not enough to justify the €22.99 (€27.99 if it's the 'Limited Edition', adding the Dismal Swamp DLC) price tag.","January 14, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does have it's downsides though.\n\nPros:\n-Runs very well(for me at least, not that my system is too old). Rarely had any issues with bugs or graphical issues. Only real bug that comes to mind is for some reson when I start flying (either in skyland or at the end) it would really mess up my keybindings with the only way to fix it is to quit and resume from the main menu. It would cause my LMB to use 2 every time I got a skull for it. It was quite fun to watch myself spamming fire everywhere. But at the last boss when having the right spell was important it became a problem. I had to beat him while avoiding using my wings even once.\n\n- Looks nice. It overall looks like it could be real. But it does have a bit of cartoonish in it. Overall very well done and polished.\n\n- Gameplay is very smooth. Aside from the flight bug I had. Animations for everything feels right.\n\n- Characters are mostly interesting. Ayumi can get annoying. But this is mainly the script and not the character herself. As a few people have stated in relation to the voice acting. The script could use some improvements. I really think it wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have everything explained by her every time something new game along. Although outside of Ayumi there isn't much involvementwith other characters.\n\n\nCons:\n- It feels like everything is handed to you. If there is some secret path to progress in the game it will show you the way. You're even given a compass to show hidden tresure. As long as you peek at it every once in a while you will have no trouble finding everything. Assuming I didn't forget to look at it a few times. Getting real annoying listoning to the main character explain everything to me. I would like to figure it out myself sometimes.\n\n- Combo's are limited. Usually in these types of games you find you buy tons of attack combo's. In this game it's mostly about spells. And they're hardly challanging to use. I don't fully call this a bad thing. Since in most of these types of games with a bunch of attack combo's you find one you like and use it for 95% of the game. I prefer this game's approach. But there's nothing really crafty about using the spells. Enemies are not really weak or strong to the elements you use. You just used them based on the effects/items you want. Closest it gets is a boss that has a shield that can only be broken by the right element.\n\n- Enemy(bosses make this the most annoying) attacks can easily rotate if you dash around them. You can be attacking a boss. Dash behind him as he attacks, and his next swing will instantly turn to you. The boss should have to turn or have an attack in that direction. Closest game I know of to seek improvement examples from would be Vindictus. Easily one of my favorite hack and slash games. Which I would still play if my account didn't get hacked and I lost everything with Nexon unwilling to fix it.\n\n- I never felt I needed/wanted to use my time powers in fights unless it was required. Biggest problem to me is that you can push the enemies around so your close's attacks becomes messed up.\n\n\nOverall 8.5/10\n\nI was never bored playing this game even though it's system is very simple and it felt like my hand was held through most of it. If they can improve the AI of enemies, make combo's more interesting and make exploring rewarding this game would easily be a 9.5 or 10 for me.","December 29, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story and voice acting leave much to be desired and the combat while very fast and fun the normal attacks don't have much weight behind them. The spells though have real impact and are where the real weighty attacks come from. fairly well paced and some really cool character designs. not something to get at full asking price but on a sale or humble bundle it is definitely worth a play.

It does have it's downsides though.\n\nPros:\n-Runs very well(for me at least, not that my system is too old). Rarely had any issues with bugs or graphical issues. Only real bug that comes to mind is for some reson when I start flying (either in skyland or at the end) it would really mess up my keybindings with the only way to fix it is to quit and resume from the main menu. It would cause my LMB to use 2 every time I got a skull for it. It was quite fun to watch myself spamming fire everywhere. But at the last boss when having the right spell was important it became a problem. I had to beat him while avoiding using my wings even once.\n\n- Looks nice. It overall looks like it could be real. But it does have a bit of cartoonish in it. Overall very well done and polished.\n\n- Gameplay is very smooth. Aside from the flight bug I had. Animations for everything feels right.\n\n- Characters are mostly interesting. Ayumi can get annoying. But this is mainly the script and not the character herself. As a few people have stated in relation to the voice acting. The script could use some improvements. I really think it wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have everything explained by her every time something new game along. Although outside of Ayumi there isn't much involvementwith other characters.\n\n\nCons:\n- It feels like everything is handed to you. If there is some secret path to progress in the game it will show you the way. You're even given a compass to show hidden tresure. As long as you peek at it every once in a while you will have no trouble finding everything. Assuming I didn't forget to look at it a few times. Getting real annoying listoning to the main character explain everything to me. I would like to figure it out myself sometimes.\n\n- Combo's are limited. Usually in these types of games you find you buy tons of attack combo's. In this game it's mostly about spells. And they're hardly challanging to use. I don't fully call this a bad thing. Since in most of these types of games with a bunch of attack combo's you find one you like and use it for 95% of the game. I prefer this game's approach. But there's nothing really crafty about using the spells. Enemies are not really weak or strong to the elements you use. You just used them based on the effects/items you want. Closest it gets is a boss that has a shield that can only be broken by the right element.\n\n- Enemy(bosses make this the most annoying) attacks can easily rotate if you dash around them. You can be attacking a boss. Dash behind him as he attacks, and his next swing will instantly turn to you. The boss should have to turn or have an attack in that direction. Closest game I know of to seek improvement examples from would be Vindictus. Easily one of my favorite hack and slash games. Which I would still play if my account didn't get hacked and I lost everything with Nexon unwilling to fix it.\n\n- I never felt I needed/wanted to use my time powers in fights unless it was required. Biggest problem to me is that you can push the enemies around so your close's attacks becomes messed up.\n\n\nOverall 8.5/10\n\nI was never bored playing this game even though it's system is very simple and it felt like my hand was held through most of it. If they can improve the AI of enemies, make combo's more interesting and make exploring rewarding this game would easily be a 9.5 or 10 for me.","December 29, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There was obviously an attempt to make a solid action RPG here, but the game is bogged with problems!\n\n- Enemies attack you through combos with no real recourse except to range them.\n- Combat is "feathery", lacking any weight or strength.\n- You spend a good portion of the game using the same combo attack over and over followed by a few exection skills to   finish off foes.\n-The aming is loose and floaty, never feeling like you are actually aiming anything.\n- Sound production is horrible, giving little feedback to the world and your interactions with it.\n- Interactive Objects are covered in the same grey/brown-mid-2000's color scheme making them easy to miss.\n-The camera has a mind of its own, often swinging around awkwardly and hiding enemies from view.\n- I stopped caring about the story ten minutes in.  It's cliched and typical and the stilted dialogue is entirely exposition.\n- Blades of Time is an attempt to blend God of War with Tomb Raider and fails to capture any of what makes either of those games great.\n- Enemies lack personality and originality\n- The jumping is quick and hard to control\n\nIn closing, I couldn't do it.  Everything wrong with the first few minutes of the game is everything wrong period.  The camera, the controls, the uninspired world, the lazy enemy concepts, the bad combat, the terrible writing, the odd and exaggurated physics and the horrendously-bad Lara Croft impression was enough to make me put this one down for good.","March 12","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The time manipulation mechanic is well implemented, it's not just for solving puzzles but can be useful in combat as it allows you to create multiple clones of yourself. Another good thing about this game is how it handles firearms, most hack n slash games that feature guns rely too heavily on auto-aiming while this game treats guns how any good 3rd person shooter would. Some of the dialogue feels a bit "out of place", but overall this is a great title and you should definetly give this one a try if you enjoy these types of games.","March 17","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And you are sort of in the middle of all this, and hack & slash your way through without true reasons.\n\nExtremely crappy story aside, there's much wrong with this title.\n\nFirst, the visuals. What seems a lush and vibrant world at first glance, is really just a stiff, brightly-colored jungle. Ayumi just clips through the greenery, the leaves and grass are mostly static. Dragonland felt like a colorful dead world. Character animations are stiff, too. What look like detailed models from afar are revealed to be really mediocre ones. But, this is a budget title, so the graphics issues are truly the least concern.\n\nWhat is a huge issue are the gameplay and the controls.\n\nAyumi moves too fast. She jumps too high. Controlling her never feels alright. Precision jumping is almost impossible. Even walking narrow ledges is a challenge due to speedy movement. The enemies have no "meat". Ayumi's swords just sort of pas through them, and then they eventually fall down. The combo system is poor, and the melee deteriorates into mindless button mashing. The shooting part of combat seems tacked-on and minimally refined.\n\nAdd to all this the fact you have to constantly bear with Ayumi's babbling, presented via poor and annoying voice-work...\n\nUgh, There's much to quit "Blades of Time", and very little to stick to it.","November 5, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is decent and the envirioments are pretty for its time and specs. The time mechanic is fun but can be op at times but frustrating at others. Game has some light puzzle elements but is very much a traditional hack n slash. If your a fan of the genre you will find a decent time here just dont expect too much from this game. For non genre players the game may seem a bit flat and too much of a clunky button masher. One important thing though is change the audio language to japanese or one of the others because the english voice acting is god awful and if you do miss the ocasional caption you wont be missing asnything worthwhile as the dialog is abysmal as well.\n\nMain draws: fun time mechanic, bog standard hack n slash fun, decent visuals, decent controls\nMain gripes: God awful english and dialog, incoherent story, terrible shooting mechanic\n\nReminds me of: Tomb raider (style/presentation), Devil may cry (mechanics), Prince of Persia (mechanics)\n\nFor: People looking for a hack n slash game on the cheap to hold them over in between other games.\n\nPrice: Wait till on some super sale below 10 dollars.","September 29, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is much faster and smoother for the most part (ignoring anything using the gun, which is awful), but that only brings it to sort of mediocre up from atrocious in the previous game. The writing/characters/story/etc. are a completely different kind of bad/annoying compared to before.

And you are sort of in the middle of all this, and hack & slash your way through without true reasons.\n\nExtremely crappy story aside, there's much wrong with this title.\n\nFirst, the visuals. What seems a lush and vibrant world at first glance, is really just a stiff, brightly-colored jungle. Ayumi just clips through the greenery, the leaves and grass are mostly static. Dragonland felt like a colorful dead world. Character animations are stiff, too. What look like detailed models from afar are revealed to be really mediocre ones. But, this is a budget title, so the graphics issues are truly the least concern.\n\nWhat is a huge issue are the gameplay and the controls.\n\nAyumi moves too fast. She jumps too high. Controlling her never feels alright. Precision jumping is almost impossible. Even walking narrow ledges is a challenge due to speedy movement. The enemies have no "meat". Ayumi's swords just sort of pas through them, and then they eventually fall down. The combo system is poor, and the melee deteriorates into mindless button mashing. The shooting part of combat seems tacked-on and minimally refined.\n\nAdd to all this the fact you have to constantly bear with Ayumi's babbling, presented via poor and annoying voice-work...\n\nUgh, There's much to quit "Blades of Time", and very little to stick to it.","November 5, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Veprovina/recommended/208670/","Veprovina","Vepar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Veprovina/","106 products in account","Blades of Time is a nice 3rd person action game with some cool mechanics and it looks good to boost. The enviroments are nice and varied, the enemies less so, but fun to fight nonetheless.\n\nFighting is pretty standard, normal attacks, magic attacks, and even 3rd person shooting.\nThe most notable mechanic is time manipulation, and you can have some pretty cool fun with it, distracting enemies with shields with a clone while you sneak behind them where they're vulnerable, piling up on them with 3 of your clones shooting a minigun at one enemy, attacking them with swords on all sides. It's pretty fun. It's also used for solving puzzles. They're not exactly brain teasers, but serve a purpose to mix things up.\n\nThere are secrets to find, some items to collect, and a co-op mode that i haven't tried but that seems to be dead. Try it with a friend if you can.\n\nAlso, to my great surprise seeing as how rarely games support that, even some big name developers don't seem to grasp the concept - this game supports hybrid gamepad and mouse input. Your mouse isn't disabled if you use a gamepad. This is especially good for Steam controller users, and the game is a delight to play as a result of that because you have better precission while shooting and are not limited to analog speeds.\n\nAll in all, this is a great port, no issues whatsoever, and the devs actually understood how to program the game for a PC. It's amazing how big name studios tend to mess up ports, but a smaller studio makes a good job.\n\nThe colors are a bit washed up, i guess that's the aesthetic they were going for, i didn't care much for that, but you can fix it as you like with SweetFX easily though so no big deal.\n\nThe story starts interesting, then looses itself a bit from the middle to the end, but all in all it's ok. If you want a good story play some RPG's or something. The story here is adequate, nothing horrible, nothing impressive.\n\nVery recommended. If you have doubts, get it on sale.","April 19","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/qDan/recommended/208670/","qDan","qDan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/qDan/","755 products in account","Blades of Time is a classic slasher game similar to Prince of Persia series in many ways, utilizing but not coping mostly all of its features - intriguing plotline, acrobatic tricks, dynamic battles with lots of unique enemies, possibility to reverse time to solve puzzles or to defeat mob hoards and tough bosses.\n\nGame has quite predictable but decent storyline, beautiful locations and good overall graphics as well as proper animations for characters and ambient, lots of gameplay features, such as combos, guns and magic, simple RPG elements with possibility to use different gear with unique properties, long enough campaign and interesting ‘Outbreak mode’ featuring dota-like gameplay but in the third person mode.\n\nFighting system much easier to learn and use then in other games, you don’t really need to focus on combos and ‘perfect’ attacks, missing few hits wont make current battle much harder or even impassable, but that doesn’t mean you can simply click whole game away. Each enemy need own strategy to deal with and bosses usually requires active usage of time rewind, temporal clones and lots of shooting, especially on hard difficulty.\n\nOf cause Blades of Time fighting system not that advanced like in Castlevania or DMC but as for me its still much more enjoyable because it wont enrage you or cheaply delay progress every time you meet harder enemies. Moreover, local magic skills may be used nearly every second without boring grind of energy\mana like in other games, thus making whole gameplay colorful and entertaining when you really enjoy slicing’n’dicing enemies differently.\n\nThat’s why its quite weird to read negative reviews on game blaming its softcore battle system or non-AAA storyline. Just compare pricetags for Blades of Time and Castlevania for example (10€ and 30€ respectively) and titles itself then ask yourself what did you expected to get for such small price and from a game company for whom it was basically a debut RPG game.\n\nThe only real cons of this game is a quite dead multiplayer (still its easy to find people to play with or against via Steam community groups) and no possibility to cooperatively play story campaign, only team-up in Outbreak Mode. Quite sad because its clear that campaign levels and story itself ready to be played in coop mode, maybe game budget was too low or developers just preferred to focus on singleplayer.\n\nStill, for a story driven game for just 10€\$ multiplayer looks more like a bonus then a mandatory feature. Thats why Im thumbing up Blade of Times and recommend this game to everybody who like hack’n’slash genre.\n","June 4","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I might pick this up again later on to play more but let me start off saying i was using a 360 controller when i played. Ok so when i first played this with a friend we did multiplayer which of course the lobby was empty. so no people. 2nd when we did play we had 0 clue what was going on. yes this was our first time playing. felt disappointed we both stopped.\n\nI decided to play single player and it was better for sure then multiplayer. people complained about the voice acting well of course i only hear 2 of them and i had no issues with them. the graphics were pretty nice and i have a crap system. the camera system didn't bother me too much either. so now you're probably wondering what my issues were. the controls for one were very unresponsive or did more then what i wanted. so for example when i did a jump i might start jumping all over the place when i only hit jump once. i over stepped many times because of this. no i didn't keep hitting jump to have this happen. another instance i walked on to a button and it started bouncing my toon around 5-6 jumps. lol i'm like really? i just stepped on it not jumping. lol. anyways the other was the attacking melee.  i noticed vs some of the mobs that it felt like you weren't hitting them or the death blow would not register and yes i was close to them.\n\ndeathblow that annoyed me too. if you missed it felt like you had to beat them down to get it again. that made no sense to me. then it would come up again. i was like uh that is a bit annoying. even the rifle was annoying. when you first get it you don't really have any indicator on enemy health. you just keep swinging or firing away until they die.\n\nso those were my concerns and maybe it is a good game but those things really did get to me.","June 6","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
