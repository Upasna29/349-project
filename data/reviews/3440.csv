Easy to learn, "plug & play" but, with increasing difficulty and clear instructions before every new thing to learn. Intense rythm, you are always clicking the mouse, no time to rest. Original, they can be based on anything else but they do their own way and with outstanding imagination. The right difficulty at the right time, to maintain the interest. Variated play modes. Ridiculous simple controls, usually just the mouse and their two buttons, some times the arrows pad is also neeced but, that's all. Very good music and sound effects....\nWell, if you already played Zuma, you know what I mean but, they have other interesting titles and this is one of them.\nHighly recommeded for casual tmes, when you are in a hurry and want to play just a bit or, for that "in between big games" time.\nONE OF THE WEAKESTS BUT, ENSSURED PLAYABILITY.\nPIPES CONCEPT BUT WITH FIRE WORKS ROCKETS","September 14, 2012","true","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
