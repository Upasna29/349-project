I don't know why; tycoon games are one of my favorite subgenres of simulation games, and I love any games having to do with transportation of any type, from cars to ships to farming equipment. In saying that, know that this review is from someone who loves the genre and trains despite being relatively new to the railroad management subset.\n\nSid Meier's Railroads! is a game that kept pleasantly surprising me. I went into this game figuring I would be building trains and connecting the tracks to various destinations. I hadn't known it would be this in depth, and yet so easy to learn. The game and its userface is extremely user friendly, and it has a short tutorial to teach you the basics. Everything else is figured out by playing scenarios. Since I was brand new to this type of game, I began by selecting a multiplayer map but electing to play first on my own so I could figure things out. That's when I realized that even when not playing competitively, this game is a ton of fun.\n\nYou start out by having a city with a small track already built that you can build off of (also, all maps can be randomized, so playing through on the same maps over and over again is different every time). You need to then decide where to go from there. Different cities request different products, and you can deliver it to them from either suppliers or other cities. This gets to be a little more in depth because you can end up having a multiple step process to have one train deliver products to various cities (for example, Train A can be set up to pick up corn from a farm supplier, deliver it to City A, City A will then convert corn to food, Train A will take food to City B, etc.). You can also have trains deliver passengers and mail from city to city. Over the course of history, trains are unlocked that have better performance. It's extraordinarily simple to upgrade these trains to better trains that have been unlocked, and all without hindering its route.\n\nThis is essentially the type of gameplay you can expect. To make things more interesting, however, depending on what cities and products you decide to utilize, cities and suppliers will grow to supply your demand and vice versa. By growing, suppliers can supply more resources and more quickly, while cities may be able to hold stock of more resources while space opens up where you can build your own industries. Cities will also request supplies from time to time, offering a cash reward for a certain product. These are some of the reasons that playing a fairly long game refrains from being boring; options are constantly opening up for you.\n\nCompetitive mode with the AI is also fun, though I prefer the single player building aspect better myself. With the AI, they will do all the things you do, building tracks, causing cities and suppliers to grow, etc. The difference here is that you are obviously competing for the goal you have set, while also having the option to buy stock in your competitors and eventually merge or liquidate their company by completely buying them out--provided you have enough money.\n\nWhile this game has been a blast (it makes me regret not trying a railroad management game before this), it does have its problems. On modern systems (I have Windows 7 64bit, for example) the game begins to crash once a good amount of railroads and trains have been built. The game is set by default to restrict itself to using only 1 GB of RAM, and once you've been in a game for a half hour or so, it will surpass this and begin crashing to the desktop. HOWEVER, there are fixes for this (see the community forums). I downloaded a .exe file from http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Railroads! that fixed everything, and haven't had a crash since. Also, the game is set by default to autosave, which saves your game every 60 seconds. Needless to say, even when it was crashing, I'd simply start it right back up and be just seconds away from where I was.\n\nIn summary, this game is an amazing game that I would recommend to anyone, particularly simulation, tycoon, and management fans. I haven't been so instantly engrossed in a game in quite some time. I'm so happy I found this!","November 5, 2014","true","25.7"," 90 of 94 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","90","94","2","0"

In five hours of play, it must have crashed over 15 times for me, and it can get itself caught in such a state that even though you can re-load autosaves, it'll keep crashing at the same point, effectively ending that particular playthrough.\n\nEdit: As pointed out below, the game issues are likely primarily an age rather than coding/QA thing (although there are still issues with train routing that are a code, not compatibility thing).  That said, would recommend a high degree of caution before playing this game on more modern system.s","November 25, 2015","false","5.2"," 141 of 165 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","141","165","5","14"

Soon after Sid Meier;s Railroads! came out, I purchased it on disk, and played it a pretty good bit. I enjoyed it, but found it rather cartoony and unrealistic, especially compared to earlier titles in the series (Railroad Tycoon 1, 2 & 3.) I also found that your railroad builds up way too quickly and you end up making more money than you could use after about an hour or so on a map. Also the maps are incredibly undersized, and in a matter of a couple hours, you can't build another line because there's nowhere to build it to, from, or across!\n\nRailroads! is rather fun, but I completely lose interest in a map after a couple hours because there's nothing left to do. The scenerios are easy, quick and too few, steam locomotives never have tenders (which just looks wrong on most engines), and there are many features from older versions that are completely abandoned!\n\nSo a quick breakdown:\nPros:\n-More approachable for beginners\n-Good for quick games, unlike older versions\n-Great opening cinematic\n-More approachable for non-railroaders\n-Very approachable stock market\nCons:\n-Little content\n-Unrealistic\n-Over-simplified\n-Maps are far too small\n-No tenders on steam engines\n-Poorly balanced\n-Maps take less than a couple hours to lose their entertainment value\n\nSo my feeling is that if you want a casual Tycoon game, this is for you, but if you're a hardcore Tycoon, try Railroad Tycoon 2 or 3.

This way, players are given a chance to enjoy the game and its numerous traits, regardless of their previous experiences with train sims. So, all it takes is going through the simplified 5-minute tutorial, and you should be ready for the challenges that come with the game's single-player and multiplayer modes. Sid Meier's Railroads boasts a unique way of allowing the player to get into the game as quickly and easily as possible. In addition, several single-player scenarios are on offer as well as a range of well-designed multiplayer maps.Firaxis managed to disregard any aspects of the gameplay that could burden the player or create unwanted micromanagement issues. Also, there's a choice of over 30 different industries to purchase and organize, 20 resources to manage and over 30 unique train models to produce and utilize. Each scenario revolves around completing a wide range of tasks, after which you can look forward to many cool bonuses - thus improving your cash balance and instituting a more stable economy for future endeavors.Looking at the graphics, Sid Meier's Railroads includes just about everything you can hope to find in a train-sim. Realistic and colorful surroundings and detailed locomotive models manage to capture the player's eye almost straight away. As your very own mass transit system begins to take shape, you'll be able to acknowledge the developer's admirable attention to detail. In closing, this game is catchy and has a little something for everyone.","August 22, 2014","true","51.9"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","37","40","0","1"

If you've played games like Transport Tycoon (Deluxe) and Railroad Tycoon (or any of its 2 sequels), then this is a must game for you.  It's a typical Sandbox style build up a rail empire type game with many fun and challenging scenarios.  There is an issue running this game on 64 bit operating systems where the game will crash with an exception error, but this can be easily fixed by applying a 3 GB memory patch which is very well documented on fan sites which exist for the game (use Google) - other than that, it's a game which will give you many hours of entertainment.\n\nI need to point out that this is not a train simulator - you do not get to drive the actual trains.\n\nI also prefer this game a lot more over Cities in Motion (if you've played it) because it doesn't require as much micro-management.  You build the track, add the trains, tell it what routes to take and what cargo, and off you go! The only additional management you need to do is upgrade your trains as new engines become available.\n\nMost enjoyable, and worth the few bob.

Even though I have both of those things in me, I just didn't like the thought of a railroad tycoon type of game even if it is from the great Sid Meier.\n\nAfter playing it though, its an enjoyable little game with a competitive element (if you chose). You chose the era to start and era to end the game. The game basically consists of you connecting resources, supply and demand. Resources get generated, such as oil, grapes, crops, livestock, minerals and so on. Then you connect them to towns that need them. A town will have one of three things demanding these resources. You setup the tracks, then make a train route to bring them in. It is just that simple. The towns will grow into cities. When they take the resources, based on what buildings they have, such as livestock and crops will turn into food. Minerals will turn into gold and so on. Then you export them to other towns that need them. The towns will grow into cities and get more buildings and need more resources for you to bring them. New towns will generate too.\n\nThe real twist here is a competitive element (if you have AI opponents). Even in single player, you can have up to 3 AI opponents (or no competition). A game of Monopoly really. You can buy stock in the other companies. You can sell your own stock for money. You don't just get money doing routes. You also get money buying facilities in towns and cities. However, when you try to buy them, you'll end up bidding against the AI competition if you have any. You can also construct facilities yourself for a flat fee if there are any available lots in a town or city.\n\nThis means, you can play Monopoly and never actually build a railroad. There's a buzz buying out your competition, but I never really felt all that threatened by them, even with all of their tracks around me. The twist of having stock and buying buildings makes the game a lot of fun in a game that wouldn't warrant replays. It is always the same map, BUT there is an option to randomize the land and cities which is very nice.\n\nWith all of that said, its a fun, relaxing, yet competitive game (if you have AI or do multi-player), but the only downside is, there's not much variety here. Once you've played one full game, you've played it all. There are victory conditions, but they're not front and center, so there's no focus on it. At $10, if you're into Monopoly style games, or railroading in general, give it a go. Otherwise, wait for a sale.","April 9, 2014","true","4.9"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","40","47","0","0"

Setting up your first station is pips and in no time at all you’ll have an entire network of trains delivering everything from passengers, coal, food and automobiles to the various towns and industries looking to reward you for your efforts.\n\nThe scalable difficulty in Railroads is a real winner too as it allows you to tailor how in-depth an experience you’re after. The easiest difficulty will allow trains to pass through each other without delay whereas a harder mode will demand you route trains carefully, punishing you with delays should you mangle your track layout.\n\nOnce the money starts rolling in though, things get surprisingly addictive as you sit back and watch your trains dutifully trundling back and forth between stations and annexes, generating you cash with a very satisfying ka-ching! sound effect in accompaniment.\n\nFor less ruthlessly minded players at least, the multiplayer component in Railroads is somewhat muted, with not a whole lot of interaction on offer but the whole aspect of buying out other players on the stock market gives it some real teeth. I remember once hearing it described as a corporate deathmatch more than a train simulation; something that might not be too far away from the truth!\n\nRailroads was well received on release and enjoys a small fan base to this day, but it’s a shame that the move to 64-bit computer systems has hampered this title’s ability to run effectively on newer computers.

It's style over substance.\n\nHaving just played Railroads (I stopped when it crashed) I can't believe this has so many positive reviews on Steam and magazines via Metacritic. It came out in 2007, but OpenTTD was more than alive at that time and far superior.\n\nThis game is brain-dead. It's a train network game, except you can't properly adjust the train network!\n\nThe auto-track placement and the complete lack of manual signals ruins this game. You get signals where you don't want signals and you can't remove them. The signals do nothing more than claim the section of track from here to the next signal, but that doesn't work when the game is placing a million pointless signals. It doesn't matter if you always make sure to use the green 'extend' rather than the yellow 'fork' placement. The game still produces insane signal placement. I had one stretch of nice smooth track with a signal at either end. I use the "double up" button and double up the entire length and now suddenly I have 6 signals right next to each other in the middle of the track, which was pointless and just messed everything up if I wanted to try and share that line. Creating passing places is also extremely difficult and trains will often just blunder their way down the track until two are in a head-to-head deadlock either side of the signals. There's no way to reverse the train so the only solution is to nuke the train and buy it again.\n\nAlso: the fully stocked train is usually the same length as the track between the resource producer and consumer! There's no room for maneuver, which further exacerbates the no-passing-places and signalling problem.\n\nBecause of the stupid signals and the uber long trains, you basically have to dedicated a line to each train. Trains cannot share track. I find that pretty demented and it basically reduces the game down to laying a track, build some stations, placing a track to exclusively dominate a section of track and then simply sitting back and watching. There's no real decision making. You can't sit their endlessly tweaking a track for extra efficiency as you can in OpenTTD.\n\nAlso: The track-layer is also really finicky. When trying to create branches I often ended up with lots of tiny bits of track that took me ages to delete because it perfectly overlaps the other bit of track. Given that "lay track" is one of the 3 primary things you can do, it gets annoying fast.","February 8, 2014","false","1.1"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","31","44","0","1"

Sometimes this game reminds me of building circuits.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dreamersfield/recommended/7600/","Dreamersfield","ZippyG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dreamersfield/","24 products in account","So, the first thing you need to know about this game is that this is in fact the original Railroad Tycoon, it's just been renamed and updated to play on modern OS such as Vista and Windows 7 (see other reviews about compatibility with newer).  There's a version of RT1 on Steam that DOES NOT play on modern OS.  But don't buy it if you're not working on an antique; you don't need it.\n\nAs for the "RAM-filled" crashing glitch, definitely dowload the patch mentioned in other reviews, but before that turn off autosave.  It saves every minute for some god-awful reason, which pushes you towards the ram limit quickly.  With that turned off, I've played for six + hours without a hitch (though I also downloaded the player-made patch, so I can't tell which did the trick, if not both).\n\nAs to gameplay, as another reviewer said, there are about 15 maps, each with scenarios that take about an hour.  However,  you can play them on three different difficulty levels, with 0 to 3 AI players, and each has gold, silver, and bronze victory conditions, so there are quite a few permutations available to keep you interested.  You can also randomize the town locations, but even without that, each time you play a map, the msc resources (lumber mills, cattle pastures, grain farms, etc) randomly generate their locations.\n\nThe most fun part about this game for me is efficiency of transport.  You can have up to four tracks per station, upgrade engines, stations, and towns to make them faster and with higher return values, and also buy properties in the towns for extra income.  This diversification of investments is more important when you're playing against AI---basically, you can own a piece of your competetor's pie! (Or they'll fight you for yours....)\n\nThe game is one of Sid Meyer's best from back in the day, and it balances well the ability to play as a sandbox builder vs a super-competitve crazy land.  (Part of the point of the game from the competitve pov is clearly to make 900 foot high roman-arched bridges over your competetors' tracks.)  If you play it like that, it's downright zany.  Truly, early Sid Meyer.  But it's also got great mechanics and logic, as per par for SM games.\n\nThe graphics are also super cute, which I particularly like.  They stand the test of time.\n\nA couple of tips to players: There's a feature that lets you go-to cities (bottom left of control panel), which is really helpful for maps that center around places you've never lived/been. (Like various parts of Europe, in my case.)  Too, you can press + or - to increase or decrease the elevation of your tracks.  There's no other way to get a tunnel when it wants to auto-build you a bridge.  Also, holding the mouse wheel allows you to swivel the map, which you can't do in RT2.\n\nIf you're wondering wether to get RT1 or 2, I like both, but for different reasons.  I think RT1 is a better game, though I remember playing RT2 way more as a kid.  RT1 is more about building and logistics, whereas I'd say RT2 is more about making money.  It's also a way harder game.  The graphics in RT2 use the Tropico engine, which is actually rather frustrating for that game.  The camera also doesn't swivel; you get four fixed viewpoints.  I could never find a satisfying map angel in RT2, and I don't know about you, but that just drives me absoutely nuts.\n\nAll in all, a very solid game, a favorite oldie, and definitely worth the tiny price.  It's one of my top favorites of all time, right up there with Roller Coaster Tycoon.  Go ahead and buy it!\n\n\nLONG STORY SHORT:\n\nPros:\n+ Very logical gameplay\n+ Well-ordered\n+ Cute graphics\n+ Short scenario play so you can have fun but still go outside and live your life\n+ Multiple scenario difficulty options\n+ Some randomization of every map\n+ Town Randomization available on any map\n+ 0 - 3 AI players\n+ Kids can play but adults will be challenged too\n+ Historic events and engine progression is sort of in the background but a lot of fun for people who are buffs/nerds of that variety :)\n\nCons\n+ Need some initial fussing with it to keep it from crashing\n+ Game starts to freeze on my computer when I get close to having the entire map networked (I'm on a laptop though)\n+ If you're connecting existing tracks, make sure the arrow cursors are green, not yellow. You will get better at it, but initially you will lay track to nowhere that you can't delete because your trains are running over it and you will curse SO MUCH.\n+ Can't upgrade all train engines at once\n+ Only about 15 maps; can't recall if there's a fully randomized map option.\n+ There's human multiplayer on this game but I'm not sure how to make it work these days; haven't tried to use it","February 1, 2015","true","54.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","2"

I was quite excited about this game as I've played Railroad Tycoon II when I was younger (and ended up buying Railroad Tycoon II Platinum on Steam a few months ago).\nThis game has the same concept wheras you start off on a map with some money, and you are to build your first line between two towns/cities to satisfy their demands. As you gain more money from doing so, you can then start to branch out and really build your company. It's not just about meeting the demands though, it's also about doing so in the most effective manor.

I actually purchased it in 1990 not long after acquiring my first desktop PC. I have played the series religiously since. I have roughly 100 hours in this game in the original 2006 disc retail box version. It certainly isn't a successor to the venerable Railroad Tycoon III, but it's still quite enjoyable if you realize this going in. The game is more of a "beer & pretzels" type real time strategy game with an emphasis  on attracting more casual type gamers. The game has a charming art style more akin to an HO or N scale model train layout than the ostensible real world look of the previous Railroad Tycoon games.\n\nIndustry acquisitions and playing the stock market against other AI railroad barons seem to have become more important in this title with train consists and railroad track signaling unfortunately taking a back seat. Being able to build your own train consists is possible (and necessary), but the importance seems to have been watered down compared to previous titles. Manual signaling has been removed altogether. The scenarios and their variety are adequate, but pale dim in comparison to Railroad Tycoon III. Firaxis encouraged fans to build maps and scenarios to add to the scenarios available. These additional scenarios can still be found on fansites. The game originally included multiplayer. Be advised, this feature has been truncated from the game entirely. The Steam version of Sid Meier's Railroads! has no multiplayer feature whatsover.\n\nMy boxed version would not run on Windows Vista without crashing to the desktop continually. It runs on my current iteration of Windows 7 64-bit, but there is a known bug concerning multi-core processors the game doesn't like. I noticed specifically when building long stretches of track I would get crashes to the desktop. I've played the Steam version for over two dozen hours as of this writing, and I rarely get a desktop crash anymore.\n\nI miss the previous versions of Sid Meier's wonderful railroad games, but oddly, this one has become my favorite of the series. Despite its lack of seriousness, it's still challenging. The game exudes Sid Meier's influence in every pixel. It's colorful art style blooms beautifully, and the sound design which has been lovingly crafted really adds to the ambience. Music from each time period sets the tone and changes along with the times. Zooming in to view the busy animations of each industry and city building is the icing on the cake.","July 3, 2014","true","34.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

I've been told there's a 60% chance I may not make it but I don't care. I'll die happily knowing that I connected Dresden to Hamburg via high speed rail. Knowing that the good people of Norwich can travel quickly and efficiently to Wrexham without a worry in the world. Knowing that the good men, women and children can travel between Paris and Calais without worrying about safety because, unlike life, safety in train travel is eternal. My friends, I just want you to know that Sid Meier's Railroads is the pinnacle of video game entertainment and has been undeservedly ignored for game of the year awards, etc. However it does not matter, to me I would say that this is the greatest video game of all time. I shed a tear, as I'm surrounded by my family and doctors, for those who have not played this game and for those who won't. Well worth the money. The greatest game in history. Goodbye my friends, my dying wish is for you to purchase this extraordinary game.","February 12, 2014","true","0.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","7","10","3","0"

Also the inability to speed up things is frustrating at times when you're just waiting for the money coming in.\n\nThe big but with this one is huge crash issues (at least with W7 64-bit). There are several possible solutions provided, but none of them is official and none worked for me. At times it plays for couple of hours before crashing which is fine considering it is very snappy to restart, but the times when it starts crashing constantly within one minute it just becomes unplayable. Got it as a part of a bundle so no great loss, but would be extremely disappointed if I had bought it separately.","December 17, 2014","false","18.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

As a railroad engineer, you connect cities by connecting them with railroads, buying trains, and designing trade routes. By using industries to convert resources to products, and then selling those products to larger cities, victory can be achieved in a number of virtual decades. Mutliplayer, unfortunately, is dead, which is sad because it would be an intriguing concept to have several players working together (or against eachother) to build up the largest stockpile of funds as cities are connected in a web of railroads.\n\nThis game is addicting, there's plenty of scenarios to play through, and plenty of maps to use. Furthermore, by randomizing cities descriptions and locations, there's a near-endless amount of ways this game can be played.\n\nFor the current price, there's no reason why a fan of Sid Meier shouldn't have this in their collection.

I also had a huge train set that we built that was about 24 feet by 8 feet . These little facts might be why I love this game so much, it triggers something from my childhood.\n\n\nIts not a complex game, but its fun and really draws you in.

Total Memory.)\nNever having experienced the crashing issue on such a grand scale with any other game that requires only a 1.4 GHz CPU, and 64 MB video memory + 9.0 DirectX, I would have to say THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE GAME and is NOT Steam's fault.\nRead on:\n\nSid Meier's RAILROADS game has more crashes than all the world's real railroads combined. Problems with the game are well known and detailed in many places on the internet. The game suffers from not being able to use enough memory to run it.\nFixes/ patches that are supposed to rectify the problem in many cases only seem to make it worse.\nWithin the gameplay there will be MANY times while laying new track that existing track will disappear, and you will see your trains running on dirt. That isn't so bad except that if you wish to continue laying track to connect to existing rails in an area that has multiple lines running in a congested area, it makes it difficult to be sure you are connecting to the set of rails intended. As the game graphics become even more overloaded, (and they WILL), you will find that the terrain map will become "layered" or "jumbled", blocking the view of the actual terrain beneath it. Areas of water will appear where there should be none, further obliterating the view. Entire cities buildings will disappear, leaving only the train station visible. You CAN do a game save, escape to the desktop, and restart the game, and USUALLY most everything will be back to normal, but NOT always. Furthermore, as soon as you start laying new track again, there go the old tracks and it starts all over.\nNot all scenarios cause these effects on the same plane.\nThe desert Mesa games seem to be the worst. Too bad. A fun game when it works right, which is not too often.\nOne more note: When the game reaches the year 2070, it comes to a screeching halt, and if you were playing a glitch-free episode and having fun, well..... yer fun ends bud. Oh, and did I mention the out and out and unexpected game crashes when you, as the player are sitting back just watching the action, and did NOTHING to cause them? 1 Star Rating because this was poorly developed and after 7+ years you'd think new patches would've been issued to finally fix this wreck.","January 26, 2015","false","754.9"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","11","20","2","1"

I probably toyed with it for a few hours trying to figure out why the game was doing such a thing. (the best way to stop the crashing is to lower your graphic settings to medium rather than high... well it worked for me anyway.)\nAside from my rather rocky start, Sid Meier did a wonderful job on this game. Controlling the railroad industry can be so entertaining (especially if you make it do really humorous roller coaster-ish looking tracks.)\nSure the train's A.I. programming ain't the best on the earth but you can always adjust it so the trains move much more easily.\nAll in all this game brings me back to my days as a child playing with those little wooden Thomas the Tank Engine toys I loved so much.\nThese games major drawbacks are mostly Ai issues. But the level design for the most part is well edited and the track maker is just plain fun to mess around with.\n","June 29, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a lot of depth to the game that really makes it challenging! When you first start up, it's best to follow the tutorial just so you know the controls. Then, see how much money you can make by shipping the correct goods to the right city--but watch for in case a town develops into a city and wants new items! You can also build/purchase a company in different cities so that you can earn even more profits. Playing with AI or other players adds a whole new level to the game when you can't use or build onto others' railroads. Instead, you have to lay your tracks around or over their tracks to get to where you need to go. Playing with another human is fun as well; hubby and I quickly found that you can force players to pay an outrageous amount of money for something they really want--or something they don't want you to get. At the same time, if you buy a company on their rail tracks, they can simply stop shipping items to your company--and you lose all the potential profits you could be making. If you make enough money, you can purchase the stocks of other players, and potentially buy out their company. Be careful about if you choose to liquidate them or merge them.... Liquidation adds all of monetary value of their stuff the the monetary value of your stocks---not to your bank account. However, if you do choose to merge their company with yours (allowing you to combine your tracks, edit theirs, and so on), you'll find that the AI tends to be rather stupid and make money--somehow--from shipping a train full of magic nothing back and forth between two cities which requires a lot of poking around to make all their stuff actually profitable for you. lol.\nIf you like management strategy games--this is definitely worth giving a try!\nThe only downside is the game will crash a LOT when  you first get it. I circumnavigated this issue by simply saving the game every two minutes and then loading the game from the saved files everytime it crashed anyways. There IS a fix for this crash issue somewhere in the forums. Hubby has WIndows7 and I have Windows8, and the fix (which called for replacing the game file with another one offered in the forums--or, alternatively, simply typing in a few coding changes in the game file manually) resolved the crashing issue for both of our computers. Once fixed, however, the game will provide hours of challenging track-laying and course-plotting to hopefully make you millions (in in-game currency of course, lol)!","May 5, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having previously played Railroad Tycoon 3 extensively, I was looking forward to a modern sequel. However, this isn't a sequel.  This game is much less advanced in it's in -game economy, track types, consist editing, and locomotive selection. AI will also sometimes have issues traversing your track, getting stuck in loops, or not using low-congestion bypasses.  That's not to say it isn't fun. You can still enjoy playing against AI or others, but it's more causal train enthusiast level than armchair railroad president.  The graphics are nice, but neither advanced, nor detailed.  Textures aren't that high of a resolution, and steam locomotives lose their tenders for the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Heinyken/recommended/7600/","Heinyken","Heinyken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Heinyken/","315 products in account","I've enjoyed this game a lot, but it has its glitches, and they are considerable.\n\n(1) I crash to desktop (CTD) about once an hour, maybe once every two. Inexplicably. This is common.\n(2) Despite having multiple maps/scenarios, after about an hour on each map, the economy is simplistic.\n(3) Route mapping for the train tracks is... odd.\n\nDespite these issues, I really enjoy this game. I'm a sucker for sim/strategy games, though. And I guess I've got a soft spot for model railroads -- who knew?\n\nThe CTD is apparently pretty common. Auto-save every minute makes this an annoyance rather than a non-playable issue.\nThe economy being so simple is annoying, but is an essential element of the gameplay. i.e.: this city needs this good - send it there. That's the point! It would be oddly restrictive if the objectives swapped around.\nI cannot abide some of the weird and usually arbitrary route mapping issues. I don't understand why every route must exist alongside or connected to a previously connected Primary Route. What is the gameplay mechanic that necessitates building routes alongside your already-existant rail routes? This is strange to me; it seems that if you want to invest in a new depot in a new city and build a new line to a new resource, you should just be able to.\n\nApart from these issues, I still recommend the game if you're a sim/strategy/builder fan. For $10? Puh-leeze. You'll spend more on your next meal at Chipotle. Spend 20 hours or so enjoying this little gem. You won't play hundreds of hours, but you'll enjoy the time you do spend playing it.","February 22, 2014","true","26.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

But multiplayer is BROKEN!\n\nI cut my teeth on Railroad Tycoon 3 which is also a very good economic simulator.  But it's missing one important detail: in RT3 the trains can't collide with each other - they just go through each other and there's no need to set up real railroad systems.\n\nSid Meier's Railroads takes care of that.  You can optionally turn on trains colliding with each other (set routes to "hard") and then they'll just wait until you build more track or figure out the right way to get them to cooperate.\n\nIt's also a fun economic sim.\n\nBut after reading other reviews and trying it myself, it LOOKS like multiplayer isn't working.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Has a "tabletop mode" to play as sandbox with no competitors.\n\n+ Good railroad building logic required (or you can use easy routing)\n\n+ There's a frog in there somewhere in the audio\n\n+ Nice cartoony atmosphere with all the historic millionaires to learn about\n\n+ Fast paced\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n- It crashes.  HOWEVER, crashing is fixed using the 3GBEnabler.  I haven't had any problems after running 3GBEnabler on the exe file.  To learn more, read this http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/server/PAE/PAEmem.mspx\n\n\n- Trains get stuck more than they should (hard routing only).\n\n- When placing track the lights will be buggy, have to delete track and replace until the lights are correct.  Unless you've played the game for a long time this won't be clear or intuitive.  Cluster-frack.\n\n- A little (maybe a lot) too cartoony for my taste.  The buidlings and tracks are enormous compared to the landscape.  Especially if you've played Railroad Tycoon 3.  In RT3 The cities are miles and miles apart, while in Railroads! the cities are only a few trainlengths apart.  Go look at my screenshots for an example.\n\n- no such thing as "X" shaped crossovers (diamond or scissors crossover).\n\n- while hard routing is much better than RT3, it's still much lacking.  You cannot set up more than a 2 pronged fork.\n\n- It looks like multiplayer doesn't work.  WTF","March 19, 2015","true","47.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm a big Sid Meier fan, and played a great deal of Railroad Tycoon 1 and 2, but this thing is a grave disappointment.  The gameplay is excessively easy; run some track and trains, money pours in, woop.  There's little need to fine-tune your trains or manifests, or even plan ahead.  The graphics are dated by modern standards of course but not bad, but cartoonish; all bright colors and everything lit as if by a spotlight.  Mountains are vastly exaggerated, making it hard to see routes.  Economics is limited; there seems to be no limit to how much of a good you can send to one city, so there's little need to search out new markets.  You can't issue stock, merge with other companies, or even take out a freakin' loan!  There's no march of technology: auto factories in the 1830s?!  The UI is OK, but a little click-happy; basic keyboard shortcuts like Esc to close a window aren't always implemented.\n\nQuibbling aside, there are two deal-breakers: first, the maps are small, a fraction of the size of RR1 or RR2.  They're also cramped, packed with towns and industries.  There's no lonely prairie where trains rumble on for miles between stops.  Games are short.  It really lacks any epic feel.  This is killer because there are only a handful of maps to play, and a handful of goals to achieve on each.  Having played four short games, I've seen about everything there is to see.\n\nSecond, the tracks.  Laying single track is fine; the program automatically adds tunnels, bridges, and overpasses reasonably well.  HOWEVER, hit the double track button and you get your own personal demon from hell to torment you.  The simplest operations now require careful planning and possibly some build-it-and-delete-it cycles.  Trains will take the wrong track and fail to recognize tracks that exist.  Nothing's more maddening than carefully laying out track, buying a train, setting up the route... and seeing that the train won't return to the first station, because it thinks it can only go one way on a certain arbitrary segment of track... somewhere.  Except maybe having that happen over, and over, and over again.\n\nOh, and it's already crashed.\n\nSo what's good?  Station management is simpler; you no longer have to worry about exactly catching all of a city's industries, build a station and it just works.  Trains won't get stalled to 1 MPH on steep slopes.  For an RR1 or RR2 fan, it's all very familiar, the learning curve is tiny (don't bother with the tutorial, just start a game).  Some maps have custom industries, like wineries and fromageries in France, a cute touch.  The "patents" system is kinda cool - you bid against the other players in a brief open auction for a ten-year bonus of some sort.  When laying track in a city, the buildings will rearrange themselves to make room, at no cost, which is hugely refreshing compared to the massive PITA that could be in RRT2, where you sometimes had to demolish chunks of a city at great expense so your railroad could catch the city and cross the river.\n\nThis thing was half-baked when it was released, and never brought up to speed.  I'm tempted to try RR3; as long as it's halfway stable, it's sure to be better than this.","February 16, 2014","false","38.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

So much so that when it crashed (1.5 hours later) it was a relief.\nThe most frustrating thing is the brain dead train routing. My trains spent most of their time staring each other down, neither moving, even though there was a perfectly good piece of track right next to them and one of them was parked on the switch.\nIn a related frustration, signals seem to pop up like weeds. Only really thorny and with deep roots, so you can't actually get them out. These signals allowed my idiot trains to blissfully drive past the switch, resulting in the starting contest previously mentioned.\nIt is also impossible to make a station longer, meaning if a train sticks out it will still trigger the station's signal causing the whole track leading up to that to stop.\nThe stock market mechanic is basic and fairly boring. My biggest complaint is that you have to wait ~3 seconds between every buy/sell attempt, meaning you can't just totally dump a company if their stock starts dropping and you can't pick up a bunch when it's cheap.\nThe lack of ability to form a monopoly was also irritating. If I own an industry, I should be able to tell it to not ship goods to my competitors, and even to not buy their raw materials. Or at least pay them a rediculously low rate.\nMy final complaint is the size of the map. I had assumed that something the size of New England would contain more than a few cities and be large enough that I wouldn't encounter my opponents for a long time. Instead, I was surprised to find myself covering a full quarter of the board after having connected only two cities and my opponents building heavily in my territory.","February 8, 2014","false","1.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","3"

Well, since it doesn't look like we're ever going to get a true Railroad Tycoon 4 and this game was on sale for $5.99 I decided, sure, it's not any more expensive than a Big Mac Value Meal, I'll give it a shot.\n\nWell, I can say this game wasn't even worth the $5.99.\n\nI knew the economic simulation of the RTC series wouldn't be present in this game - no fluctuating prices, no inefficient "Tycoonatrons" moving materials and goods independent of railroad to simuate how the real world works, no independent industrial growth.  That was fine.  But there are only 6 or so types of raw materials, and demand never ceases so all you have to do is hook up more and more supply facilities to the cities.  Oh and there's very few cities either, and no growth caps - Los Angeles and Tehachapi will both grow into "Metropolises" once you give them their materials.  The maps are TINY and build out very fast.\n\nAt first I was pleasantly surprised by some innovations Sid Meier has introduced to the track-building mechanics:  Tracks and stations can go anywhere in cities, no more tedious weaving around or knocking down buildings to get your station into a city, or having to locate in a certain spot to cover as much of a sprawling city as possible.  Just plop your track and station down and the buildings automatically move around to get out of your way!  Wonderful!  Unfortunately, the double track mechanic is awful and making parallel tracks connect to each other takes an act of God.  I found myself constantly having to build switches between the parallel tracks, and even high priority trains stop every time they encounter a switch.  Even worse, there is no undo button AND NO BULLDOZER BUTTON so once you build a track, you're stuck with it.  My tracks looked like disorganized monstrosities because of this, with trains constantly bogging down at a dozen unnecessary switch signals.  At least there aren't any sanding/water towers required here...but it really doesn't matter.\n\nOnce you get into a position to buy out your competitors, make sure to liquidate their assets rather than absorb them, because absorbing a well-established competitor will instantly bring the game (and I don't run a cheap system) to its' knees with freezes and eventual crashes, and that's what brought me back to this screen, completely fed up.\n\nI don't know how this game got through the play-testing phase of development.  The simplistic economy is a disappointment after the fantastic Railroad Tycoon 3 but I can handle it.... but the track building snafus are just awful, and overall I find this game just wasn't enjoyable even when it does operate smoothly.  I hope we get a true successor to Railroad Tycoon 3 someday.","December 26, 2013","false","0.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PredatorDrone18/recommended/7600/","PredatorDrone18","PredatorDrone18","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PredatorDrone18/","174 products in account","This is actually a damned good game. A lot of people who see this probably think, "Oh that's just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ simulator/tycoon game that nobody cares about." If you've ever even began to think something like that about this game, before you play this ♥♥♥♥ you better head down to your local church, because you just sinned in the eyes of the LORD. Upon this game Christ has laid his blessing. In fact, Sid Meier is literally the second coming of Jesus Christ, and he used his powers to make games. To prevent me from using more religious analogies, I'm going to stop describing the game like this, and instead give you a play-by-play of how this christened game works:\n\nAlright, so you start off not knowing what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on. I mean, you start building tracks, and then all of the sudden you're ♥♥♥♥ing bankrupt, so you sell the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed tracks. So, now you just have enough tracks to connect the little ♥♥♥♥ city you start in with the little ♥♥♥♥ town nearby. So now you need to place a train on the tracks, right? Common sense, you little ♥♥♥♥♥. So, now you do that. Go ahead, I'll wait. I would tell you how, BUT I DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING KNOW. I simply don't understand why placing tracks is the easiest thing on earth, whereas you have to ♥♥♥♥ing master quantum mechanics AND astrophysics to place that little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a train on the track. Anyway, once you successfully divide by zero and get a train on your tracks, that little thing starts chugging along, pumping out black smoke and successfully producing large quantities of carbon dioxide long before the invention of automobiles. 'MURICA! So, once your train is pulling its ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ along the track at the speed of a ♥♥♥♥ing snail, you can start picking ♥♥♥♥ up. Just drive on over to the little town, pick up a few ♥♥♥♥♥s and hoes, and then drive on back. Then, grab some peeps and ♥♥♥♥♥es from that town, and brong them back. You just created a passenger train system, congratu-♥♥♥♥ing-lations. What do you want, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? If so, the next step is sticking your ♥♥♥♥ on the train tracks when one is coming. If not, build more train tracks. Connect a ♥♥♥♥♥on of cities and farm and oil rigs and mines and ♥♥♥♥ing everything with train tracks. Eventually you'll have a disorganized mess of rail laying all over the p0lace. You won' be able to see the groud at all, it's just 100% rail, and the money is ♥♥♥♥ing rolling in. You are the wild-west equivilent (assuming you picked the southwest map; if not, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself and stop reading this review) of a modern-day billionaire. You have all of the traits: ability to kill the locals with carbon output just to save a few bucks; the mentality that you can put your tracks whereever and whenever, and if anyone had anthing to say about it, you'll shove a train in their ♥♥♥; and, most importantly, the balls to charge people more, when you know nobody can afford it. So, you are a ♥♥♥♥ing LEGEND at this point. You have stacks on stacks on MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING STACKS you dirty ♥♥♥♥. You have so many train tracks that nobody can go outside without being hit by a train. YOU ARE A KING. What shall we do next? Well, I can add this track he- wait... what's that? Why is the screen black? WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥? WHAT DO YOU MEAN RAILROADS! ISN'T RESPONDING? Fine, ♥♥♥♥ it, I ain't even mad, I'll just try again.\n\nAlright, after a couple of hours, I got as rich as before, and I even have a more organized track layout now. Wait... are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me? ♥♥♥♥ing blackscreen? Not responding? I CAN RUN ♥♥♥♥ING CRYSIS, YOU LITTLE ♥♥♥♥, I THINK I CAN RUN THIS ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥ THIS. I DIDN'T ♥♥♥♥ING SIGN UP FOR THIS. ♥♥♥♥ YOU. I'm out, ♥♥♥♥ you filthy ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nFinal review: 8/10 really good.","May 22, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay is awful and nothing like that of the previous games.\nIt feels severely lacking and sort of slow and clunky.\n\nThe track building is kind of stupid. It doesn't feel like the previous games, and if you build through a town, it simply pushes the buildings out of the way of the track. also it lags when placing down large sections of track.\n\nThere isn't much of an economy in this game, it is simply "this place has this, this other places wants that"\nand there are so few types of goods you can haul.\n\nthe stock market aspect of railroad tycoon 3 was so much better than this game. in this game, there is a few "tickets" that are somehow stocks, and you buy them. I don't exactly know what you do with them because i stopped playing this game.\n\nYou can barely zoom out. you can zoom in pretty close, but you can only get about a hundred feet into the air, unlike RT3 where you could zoom out to see pretty much the entire map. In the third screenshot they show of this game, that's pretty much the limit to your zoom.\n\nIn railroad tycoon 3, there was a detailed level editor and scripting feature so you could design your own scenarios to share, or play with your friends. After playing this game, I can't find any sort of level editor.\n\nOverall, this feels like a game you would give to your kids and let them play it while they are still too young to understand what a good game is. It does not feel like a successor to railroad tycoon 3, It seems as though they just took a good series, created a pile of unoptimized, dumbed down junk and slapped sid's name on it.\n\n3/10","February 26, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

There seems no limit on the amount you can "double-up" track - except for in stations where four lines of rail seems to be the limit - but trains do not automatically opt for the deconflicted route, and there seems no way to manually achieve this (i.e waypoints or forcing to change station).  Trains just sit there at loggerheads until you scrap them!  Also, you have to tediously create cross-overs between lines, which would be OK if the trains used these cross-overs sensibly, but they don't.\n\nRant over.

Here's what i liked and didn't like.\n\nLiked:\nGraphics\nTrain variety\n...... ummm... building's in towns will move to let you place track pretty much anywhere, so that makes things easy\n\nDisliked:\nokay, lets say you are going to build your own miniature railroad but only have a 2 ft x 2ft area to build in. You could make everything very small scale and fit alot in or, like this game, make everything oversized to rediculous proportions. even the biggest cities are hardly as wide as 4 RR tracks, and one full sized 6 car train can be in 3 towns at once. As you might imagine, this creates some major issues when you have more than one train running. If they had either made the maps larger or the trains and tracks smaller this would have been a much better game.\n\nI bought the 3 pack of Sid Meier's Railroads, RR tycoon 2 & 3.

Compared to titles such as Simutrans or Transport Tycoon, there is no way to influence train's movement and even the best network can fall prey to constant gridlocks (even having one-way tracks would be a godsend). Pretty much the only way I could avoid the issue is to give each line a separate track, which is kinda crazy. Or, play on difficulty lower than hard (with unrealistic train behavior), which in my opinion misses the point of a railroad simulator.","February 11, 2014","false","15.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics are nice and theres even a good bit of tension when going against Opponents, trying to buy each other out first.\n\nHowever, if you were expecting well developed tools to create delicate railnetworks, bustling Trainstations and elegant bypasses of your humming Cargohubs - stay away! I dont even mind that the maps are so tiny compared to todays standarts, but the crippled pathing tools just wont let you go to your fullest extent. Planning a longer route ahead? Cant do - build in intervalls and sell the last part of your rails again to try anew. Want an X-cross to enable trains switching track in one spot? No way. Even something simple as two trains heading the same direction on the same path? Unthinkable. And to top it all off? Its not running stable either. I had 2 crashes in not even a full hour.\n\nIt is a neat littly game for in-between i guess. Worth the 2,50 I gave at sale - I wouldnt spend more on it, though.

Railroads is a very basic, fast-paced, easy to learn game that unfortunately doesn't get very deep. Train routes play out basically the way they do in most railway simulators, but with a simplified commodity system. The rail-laying mechanic is finnicky and buggy, which is particulary annoying as it is the primary action of the game.\n\nWhile increasing difficulty does offer more of a challenge, the mechanics simply aren't deep enough to keep me interested for more than a few games (which only take an hour or so to complete, which isn't an issue, but I mention in case someone saw "Sid Meier" and thought games would be 7 hour long civ-like games).\n\nIn the end, there are much better transportation simulation programs out there","February 6, 2014","false","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Whilst they won't look as gorgeous as this game, the game play is vastly superior. Firstly, pathfinding is broken for trains - they will often just sit at signals (which you can no longer set yourself) for ages, before simply passing through trains anyway. Secondly, it's buggy - senarios can span a century, and the game can't handle the number of railways you will build in that time. Trying to build tracks late-game can be frustrating - most of the time you'll wait a minute while it catches up and the rest of the time it'll crash.\n\nAvoid and play the much better RT2 and RT3 (latter is more complex and in my opinion more rewarding, former is easier to play)","February 15, 2014","false","13.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gameplay is easier, more logical and intuitive, and the graphics are much, much better.  The constant crashing mentioned by other reviewers -- runtime errors, the software algorithms run into logical defeats -- can be reduced greatly if you daisychain your tracks as per the turorial and don't try being "too clever" with collection/dropoffs on extended lines, or completing (quite by accident) a "circuit", since the calculation tables used are flat arrays, not paradox-susceptible loops.  Playing with an AI oponent also increases chance of crashing, as the AI is essentially stupid. This means half the supplied scenarios, which depend on you buying out all the stocks in AI opponent companies, cannot be played beyond sandbox mode. Using older graphics cards can make the animation jumpy, so you'll need a PCI-express based system at the very least.  My best AGP card, an ATI Radeon 1650 Pro, had trouble keeping up.  This is a wonderful "update" on an old PC title from the DOS era, and worth looking into, whether or not your played the original.\n\nOne small niggle: no "passing time" control beyond normal and ffwd, the set scenarios are time-dependent (in game years) and this ticks away faster than you can build up your empire to the required "win" standard.  A "llama" or "tortoise" speed would be helpful.  Otherwise you have to put the game on pause to assess your next moves, and on pause you make no profit.\n\nAnother niggle: not enough single-player scenarios.  Once you've learned how to play without crashing every five minutes (it's possible, I've done it), you work your way through the provided quest maps very quickly.  But hey ho, play them again for a higher score in the Hall of Fame.","January 29","true","47.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One basically has to build an own track per train or they will lock up (or one has to play with easy routing)\n* The 3D interface makes it very difficult to lay track as one likes it. And more often than one would expect switches will not work. I managed to had a whole track in a station unuseable for mysterious reasons. Routing wouldn't use it, Trains could not be set in there.\n* The 3D look is also more like a model railway than a real one. Especially the way height is overscaled looks ludicrious (the Western US seemingly mainly consists of peaks and valeys). Also one can only zoom out very slightly, giving no good overview of the landscape.\n* The economy model is quite simpel. Lots of X delivered somewhere => Price of X decrease slightly everywhere (if the fluctuations were even caused by delivery action). You can overdeliver a good to an industry (exhausting its storage capacity so it is thrown away) and still get full pay.\n* The differences between the engines are quite simple. One isn't even told their climbing abilities.\n* And finally if one wins a scenario (at least if one does it an age earlier than expected) the game crashes to desktop.\n\nThe older Tycoons were better. A more realistic, albeit more abstract model of railway management is e.g. "Rails across America".","February 10, 2014","false","8.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

At the same time, to make it more accessible, many complex features were removed and replaced with very basic ones, if any. Pathing is awful, hence the addition of a "pass through" feature, where a train blocked by another can slowly phase through it. Even on the more difficult levels, you can't really go wrong. A lot of the industry feels pointless, the maps are too small, and the AI is awful.","January 13, 2014","false","4.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It was a great game in spite of it's problems ("rate wars" where the loser had to tear up his track and leave town never struck me as historically accurate).\n\nFifteen years later, Sid Meier's Railroads hit the scene.

Much like Sid Meier's Civilization this game subtly teaches a bit of railway history.  This game is not a Railway Sim game that you need to aquire the keen skills of driving a train.\n\nMost of the time I have played this game in single player mode againts 3 A.I. players. The A.I. can be ruthless when playing playing at hard levels. The A.I. generally doesn't waste money and calculates the best return on investment. With a bit of strategy you can compete for the same resources making it more costly for them to operate.\n\nI have played this game on a LAN with four players.  Multiplayer game play feels more like a single player map early on, Once you have expanded you railway empire, it starts to get really interesting as you complete for the same limited resources.\n\nThe game may eventually crash after all the players railways have grown very large.   You will need to find the 3GB Ram fix to make the game work with large complex maps.\nThere are a number of community maps / mods that can be really fun to play and introduce you to new areas of the world.\n\nAfter playing Sid Meier's Civilization I found zooming out to see a larger area (FOV) of the map is very limited. This is somewhat like using a flashight in a cave, you only see small areas of what may be an enormous space.\n\nMaybe one day they may entertain the idea of developing a Sid Meier's Railroad 2.","April 3, 2015","true","177.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Where I think it really shines, though, is the multiplayer. In this mode you compete with other players to try and score the highest by the end of an era or, more likely, till you buy everyone else out. While the original game servers are down, services like Hamachi and Gameranger dupe the game into thinking you're playing LAN over the internet.\nIt is worth noting that most people will have to install a patch that fixes issues with RAM and crashing, but there is an installer online that will do all the dirty work for you.","November 15, 2015","true","38.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That seems to be the problem for most people. The crashing is very annoying otherwise. It's been shared on various steam forums. 7MB download, swap out the EXE, and you're all set. Doesn't conflict with Steam.\n\nTHAT SAID.\n\nI love this game. If you like logistical planning, trains in general, or economic strategy games, you will probably like this. The only thing I dislike about it is that there are times when your loss is a foregone conclusion because you can't expand any further without spending money and you're just racing your opponent to see who can buy the other one out first.  The patent system grants advantages that aren't terribly apparent.\n\nOther than that -- the game is beautiful, has great sounds and flavor, and it's a lot of fun.

If you are not comfortable with troubleshooting crash problems, I actually wouldn't recommend this game. If I find the file to adjust the size and the instructions again, I will post it.\n\nNow for the second problem to get out of the way: the game automatically places trains on your tracks. Very often you will have open track for a train to use, and the game will unfortunately use track that already has a train on it, causing both trains to be stuck if set on the highest routing difficulty. There are also a number of smaller things to keep an eye on where a small slip might be confusing for a while at first. Sometimes you forget to put a depot somewhere at all, sometimes your track doesn't reach the depot, things like that. It will generally be frustrating at first.\n\nFinally, multiplayer is based on Gamespy, and thus doesn't work.\n\nHowever, once the crashing is fixed, and once you learn how to make up for the routing problems (which you shouldn't have to), it really is a fun game. At first I thought it was going to be too easy, as I quickly moved up the difficulty ranks until I was at all but the highest difficulty level. Then for whatever reason I started doing worse, so now I play on medium difficult (mogul). There is a fast forward option for the late game phase when you are often just saving up enough money to buy out another rr. You can also pause it, and do stuff while it is paused. It is generally very laid back, but not too easy. Somehow I want to compare it to a more skill-based version of monopoly, I suppose because you are trying to buy out your opposition. Unlike Monopoly, it is nice to have a certain amount of cash available instead of buying up everything right away, since other characters can start auctions at any time. The fact that you can keep an eye on your opponent's current cash can give you very helpful insight into their intentions, though.\n\nIn short, this game is not recommended for those who are easily frustrated. With a little work, both in getting it to work at all and learning the unfairly bad train placement, this game works fine and is pretty laid back without being too easy.","July 4, 2015","true","51.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you can't get online players to compete with, the game comes with up to 3 built-in opponents with sophisticated A.I. (artificial intelligence).

It is really easy to learn but you get quite bored of it after a while, it is only fun to play for about two hours a day. But it is fortunately not possible to play this game for a long time because it crashes, a lot.\nIt gets really annoying:\n-Remove wrong part of the tracks that doesn't exist anymore but still shows up : Crash\n-Accidentaly build overlapping tracks : Crash\n-Taking a ♥♥♥♥ in rl and then coming back : Crash\n\nSo you really need to save a lot, but it not only crashes, it has quite some bugs too:\n-Often the double railways don't really detect the stations so that no "dropoff zone" is being created\n-Trains clipping through each other\n-Trains taking unnecessarily long ways to the dropoff station\n\nBut, do I still recommend it?\nDefinitely!\nIf you can get it for a really low price you will have quite some fun for a few hours, but important:\nSAVE!\nOr you will get really angry at the game.\nIt is just really fun to watch everything evolve and something for a nice sunday afternoon with not much action and a really low difficulty.","May 2, 2015","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically you start off as a fledling railroad, with some starting captia, a starting railroad and station, and from there, the world is your oyster.\n\nPros:\n\n- It is a railroad tycoon simulator, causing you to take time, pause the game, look around the map, figure out which towns/cities you want to lay track to to set up passanger, mail, and goods cars; all the while, looking around to find resources and facilities that process them to make a profit.\n\n- You are always looking for markets, and industries to claim ownership over, provide materials, and export the produced goods to make a buck.\n\n- Music and graphics are 7/10.  Nothing ground breaking but not horriable as well.  Also, the ability to be able to move the camera to "ride" the selected train is a nice touch.\n\n- You are able to buy stock in your own company as well as your competitors, allowing you to buy them out, and either liquidate everything they owned or seize ownership and merge them into your own company to make money off of their "hard work".\n\n- You are given the ability to build industries in cities and towns to help them grow, as well as expand your own industry base for your company\n\n- Always have to think one step ahead, especially if you are playing against max AI on hardest difficulty level, which really adds another depth of thoughtful gameplay.\n\n- New trains will always become available, causing you to think about which ones you can, need and must upgrade vs ones you can leave alone.\n\n- There are auctions for buying new industries, and patents, which will give you a greater amount of leverage for your company and it's success in the game.\n\n-Plenty of different maps, with different resources and industry chains to explore, plus time era challanges.  One map may be only for a gold rush in Californa USA, yet another would be weapons production in Britian.\n\nCons:\n\n- If you want to upgrade all of your trains, you need to click your way down the list, no selection to change all all at once.\n\n- Gameplay can feel a bit stagnent after a while and repititive.\n\nAll in all, I do enjoy this game.  It is a fun little game when you need a break from your main games and are looking to play a tycoon based game.","April 27, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game brings me back to my 'Railroad Tycoon' games and is wonderfully fun with competitive stockmarket sharing and everything! The game incorporates several different maps, resources and resource types across maps. Releases new technology as time goes on -- the game is exciting and a lot of fun..\n\n..BUT. I do not recommend this game unless you wish to sit there and have consistent disappointment for one reason. The game looks like it would be fantastic in multiplayer but I dare not even try it because EVERY THREE MINUTES -- the game just crashes. It seems to be a consistent problem across many of Sid Meier's games too. Fix this problem! The game would be recommended with the best rating I could give it if it was not for this REALLY annoying factor. Also, to add to frustration - the game claims it saves every so often. Where? I cannot find any mention of any save file. I could just save it myself but unless you wish to save every 15 seconds -- and I mean, literally -- then you will continually keep losing data again and again with this game. It's just not worth the time.\n\n[EDIT: If you download a patch that can be found online, and use it to override your copy of this game - it works perfectly. Like a charm. No more crashes and the game becomes awesome again. I'll change my rating to a thumbs up but BE WARNED all - you will need this downloaded patch to play the game, after you get it - it becomes awesome again].","July 17, 2014","true","39.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only it costs you ingame to add more rail (as oppose to real money in RL).\n\nI have some criticisms;\n\n-The maps too small/cramp, everything is too close to each other with not much space to breath. This is not a problem early on but later on when you have a lot of trains it doesn't give you much room to give them room.  This is likely why theyimpliented a system where building move to make way for you, if it wasn't like that there would be  lot more problems.\n-I often find after a while about 4-6 trains just glitch and end up in a part of the map where their routes are not located bugging out. Only way to solve the issue is get rid of the train and replace it. (edit: turns out like Transport tycoon, hich had the same problem, if you keep trains on their own tracks and DON'T link to toother tracks, they never got this bug.  So a cattle train must not connect to a passenger rail, it works anyway as the trains rarely also get in each others' way)\n-Ugliness.  Once you start building 4 track stations your map begins to really look an eyesore.\n-The double rail system is annoying.  Once you connect a double rail track to another rail you can't continue to make that track double rail.  Transport Tycoon never had this problem, its an older game.  And Railroad Tycoon doesn't bother being overcomplex. Both have better rail systems in game.\n\nThose are the things I've encountered.  Still the game is fun and a attractive alternative to playing the Railroad Tycoon series, its fairly simple.\n\nSome advice;\n-For those who cant make a buck; ignore passengers, they get you no money.  Even if the train hs to come back empty in one direction, it will often make far more money then city to city passenger and mail services. I figured this out after two games and now just ignore them unless the goal of themap states to do a certain amount. Processed goods should be your main focus of set up, the sooner you get drugs to hospitals and things like that, the sooner you make big bucks.  The game tries to push you to shift this inthe tutorial as  early train load, but I've encountered more profit at the begining regardless ignoring them.  Passengers and mail are easy, hence why its a lot profit service, as you're justgoing from town to town. Even later on, trains will not provide much profit even when faced with a 100mph train attached.  You cn earn a buck with these, but this involves setting up a single train to go around every town.\n-If a industry is going to even hint it will mke money before you start a train unloading there buy it; usually within 15 years with regular supply by your trains it earns back the cost and goes into profit.\n-If a trains says it handles "frieght" stuff, but its slower then that passenger train capable olf 100 mph, still buy it.  The ideal cargo thing actually pays off, for 20 less speed it often hauls just as well or slightly better speed.\n-If you can afford a train and the maintance cost of id train is cheaper, upgrade.\n-You don't have to upgrade every train to the latest model, but bare in mind their cheaper and if you have the cash its best to.  Short of money?  Ether you've set up your trains wrong or just resort to every other model upgrade until you have millions in pocket.  But don't ignore upgrading completely. The newer trains haul cargo at a faster pace.\n-Invest in patents even if your the only player in the game.  That early purchase often hs huge benefits and later on in the game, you will soon back tht 50,000 you spent on it within seconds often.\nIf you have enouh room to create a short cut rail between different stations, do it.  the fastest single problem this game has, particular when faster trains come out is the overload of trains to every station.  If you have find room for a rail that will avoid a train being somewhere it doesn't need to be thisis great.","January 25","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are not comfortable with troubleshooting crash problems, I actually wouldn't recommend this game. If I find the file to adjust the size and the instructions again, I will post it.\n\nNow for the second problem to get out of the way: the game automatically places trains on your tracks. Very often you will have open track for a train to use, and the game will unfortunately use track that already has a train on it, causing both trains to be stuck if set on the highest routing difficulty. There are also a number of smaller things to keep an eye on where a small slip might be confusing for a while at first. Sometimes you forget to put a depot somewhere at all, sometimes your track doesn't reach the depot, things like that. It will generally be frustrating at first.\n\nFinally, multiplayer is based on Gamespy, and thus doesn't work.\n\nHowever, once the crashing is fixed, and once you learn how to make up for the routing problems (which you shouldn't have to), it really is a fun game. At first I thought it was going to be too easy, as I quickly moved up the difficulty ranks until I was at all but the highest difficulty level. Then for whatever reason I started doing worse, so now I play on medium difficult (mogul). There is a fast forward option for the late game phase when you are often just saving up enough money to buy out another rr. You can also pause it, and do stuff while it is paused. It is generally very laid back, but not too easy. Somehow I want to compare it to a more skill-based version of monopoly, I suppose because you are trying to buy out your opposition. Unlike Monopoly, it is nice to have a certain amount of cash available instead of buying up everything right away, since other characters can start auctions at any time. The fact that you can keep an eye on your opponent's current cash can give you very helpful insight into their intentions, though.\n\nIn short, this game is not recommended for those who are easily frustrated. With a little work, both in getting it to work at all and learning the unfairly bad train placement, this game works fine and is pretty laid back without being too easy.","July 4, 2015","true","51.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had basically no idea what I was doing in terms of economics or strategy, but I would waste hours and hours just making the little trains go 'round the map. It was a simpler time and a happy time, and Sid Meier's Railroads! absolutely lives up to my memories. Yes, it has its flaws - certainly, the track-laying could have used some work, and I would have loved more customizability with the trains themselves, but overall, here we have in my computer the simple joy of setting up a model train set and watching it go.

I like each one, but this first one -- simply entitled "Railroads" -- is my favorite.  I guess when it comes down to it, it's the simplicity I like; #2 & #3 are definitely more complex and are really geared for people who like to mess with numbers and markets and such.  To me, #1 here is more about the building of railroads, which is really the point, right?  There is a market system, yes, but it's clearer and more manageable than the two successors' are.  And I have to say the actual building of a rail system is a lot easier and clearer as well.  Building a railroad in #2, for example, seems to be taking a step back in terms of graphics and ease of controls.\n\nThe one (MAJOR) downside of this first game is that it seems to crash quite often.  I've tried it on three computers, each one noticably different than the others, and the game just crashes at seemingly random points on all computers.  If it weren't for that, this easily would be one of my favorite games.","January 5","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your main goal is to transport goods from point A to point B while making a profit, completing some challenges, and beating your rivals.\n\nI'll start off with the negative aspects of this game which are: the game will crash on you about every 2 hours which is very annoying but there is a patch you can get online to fix that so make sure you get that or this game will be broken, the game can be buggy at times although rarely game breaking it can get annoying and games do start to feel a little repetative. The games in general don't take overly long to play there's a nice\n\nAlthough once you get some third party help to fix the random crashing the game becomes very enjoable even if the games can be a little short. Some positive aspects of this game would be: the graphics do look pretty nice, it's fun planning out where to place your rail roads to maximise on efficiency, slowly buying out your rivals, bidding against your rivals for perks that will aid you, getting new trains and planning the route you want your train to take. These are just a few examples of what make is this game fun to me.\n\nAlthough initially buggy and crashy at first once a third party patch is added it makes for a very fun game that you can sit down and play a nica simple game for short periods of time. This game may not be for everyone just because of how simple the game can be comparred to other simialar games.","January 10","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like each one, but this first one -- simply entitled "Railroads" -- is my favorite.  I guess when it comes down to it, it's the simplicity I like; #2 & #3 are definitely more complex and are really geared for people who like to mess with numbers and markets and such.  To me, #1 here is more about the building of railroads, which is really the point, right?  There is a market system, yes, but it's clearer and more manageable than the two successors' are.  And I have to say the actual building of a rail system is a lot easier and clearer as well.  Building a railroad in #2, for example, seems to be taking a step back in terms of graphics and ease of controls.\n\nThe one (MAJOR) downside of this first game is that it seems to crash quite often.  I've tried it on three computers, each one noticably different than the others, and the game just crashes at seemingly random points on all computers.  If it weren't for that, this easily would be one of my favorite games.","January 5","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a more casual version of a Railroad Tycoon game, but still has the enjoyment of considering which routes and supply lines will maximize profits.

I've never been able to play a campaign without multiple crashes hampering my efforts. What's more, the AI is poor and the track laying is at times completely rediculous.

THIS GAME HARDLY CRASHES IF your computer is decent. Mine is halfway decent and I only had two crashes both because I ALT + Tab'd out which is a breaking point for any old game.\n\nUnderstand: This game is really fun!\n\nPros:\n\n-AI's are smart. Very smart. I would go as far as saying they are "Turnt af". Yes, I did just use that in a sentence.\n\n-Making Railroads is very intuitive and once you learn the key-bindings, becomes second nature.\n\n- Finding the best "Get rich quick" scheme is a task and usually different with every play through. Example: one play it was gold that ♥♥♥♥ed the economy raw and another time it was food that did the trick.\n\n- ♥♥♥♥IN TRAINS! new trains, old trains, red trains, blue trains (Yes, train customization)\n\nCons:\n\n- sometimes the tracks get all messed up and are hard to click on without selecting something else\n\n- Tunnels are very difficult to manage almost to the point where you would save more by just going around\n\n- AI's are smart as ♥♥♥♥. Like assrape you sideways smart.\n\nTL:DR\nGet this if its on sale cause you will spend lots of hours staring at trains trying to get the most cash and doing missions out the ♥♥♥.

Your main goal is to transport goods from point A to point B while making a profit, completing some challenges, and beating your rivals.\n\nI'll start off with the negative aspects of this game which are: the game will crash on you about every 2 hours which is very annoying but there is a patch you can get online to fix that so make sure you get that or this game will be broken, the game can be buggy at times although rarely game breaking it can get annoying and games do start to feel a little repetative. The games in general don't take overly long to play there's a nice\n\nAlthough once you get some third party help to fix the random crashing the game becomes very enjoable even if the games can be a little short. Some positive aspects of this game would be: the graphics do look pretty nice, it's fun planning out where to place your rail roads to maximise on efficiency, slowly buying out your rivals, bidding against your rivals for perks that will aid you, getting new trains and planning the route you want your train to take. These are just a few examples of what make is this game fun to me.\n\nAlthough initially buggy and crashy at first once a third party patch is added it makes for a very fun game that you can sit down and play a nica simple game for short periods of time. This game may not be for everyone just because of how simple the game can be comparred to other simialar games.","January 10","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It features scenarios to try and beat and set high scores on, much like civ or roller coaster tycoon or a "tabletop" mode that just lets you build out a railroad without having to worry about money or objectives. Where I think it really shines, though, is the multiplayer. In this mode you compete with other players to try and score the highest by the end of an era or, more likely, till you buy everyone else out. While the original game servers are down, services like Hamachi and Gameranger dupe the game into thinking you're playing LAN over the internet.\nIt is worth noting that most people will have to install a patch that fixes issues with RAM and crashing, but there is an installer online that will do all the dirty work for you.","November 15, 2015","true","38.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So far, it is a piece of junk.  There are known problems with this software, which has apparently not been updated since it's "Steam Release" 9 years ago.  And yet this "Steam" operation pathetically continues to charge their customers money for this essentially unsupported application.\n\nApparently, there are some "unofficial" patches available (Check on the Sid Meier RailRoads forum) that can or may patch around the outdated interface, depending on what operating system and hardware you have but, unless you like to play around with swapping out .EXE files and such hacker type stuff, I don't recommend this  software.  Even at under $3, it's hardly a bargain.  Too bad, since it looks like it might be fun to play with, regardless of your age, as long as you can read.\n\nI'm running a Dell Core (I7 processor) Laptop with a G4 (high res) display ATI graphics, 12 GB of ram, Windows 10 (64 Bit).  Railroads will run for about 3 minutes or less and then just stop, with the Windows warning page that the program has stopped responding.  Apparently, from reading the Forum, everybody has this problem in one way or another and it might be caused by the newer hardware, newer bios software, memory availability, or all of the above.\n\nUnless you want to tinker with some old code, I say forget about it","December 14, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
