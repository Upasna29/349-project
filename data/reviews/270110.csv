And to be honest, I'd already uninstalled it before release because it was already a fairly tedious game not improved by the odd loading limitations of the world chunks.  I can't say I was enthused when I heard about the new pay model, but as the devs claimed the game was fully playable without, I thought I'd give it a fair chance.\n\nOne thing I will give them:  the world looks much better now that it's loading larger chunks, or else loading them faster.  And the topography of the world section I've been playing in is much more realistic, whereas it used to just climb off into Escheresque directions at random.  Water physics is still confusing, where you think you're going to float, and sometimes you do, and sometimes you end up at the bottom of a ravine.  The 'village' you start in is rather charmingly constructed, at least.  And speaking of charming, the baby dragon is a nice touch.\n\nAs to whether the game is playable without pouring cash into it...well, that depends.  Do you have a high threshold for tedium?  Because this has not changed.  To be fair, it hasn't changed one single bit--as far as I can tell, they haven't slowed down any of the processes from what I remember.  It's just that it's exactly as bad as I remember.  Your tools last practically no time at all, whether they're constructed of stone or iron.  The higher the tier, the faster it goes, but pretty soon you feel like you're spending all your time mining just to replace your tools so you can mine some more to replace your tools.  The dragon is cute and quite useful in the outset, but I already feel like I'm going to be spending all the time I'm not mining trying to keep it fed.  And in order to feed it, I could keep giving it apples, at least until I run out locally...or I could give it meat from animals I have to run down to kill, while they're healing obscenely fast, so that I always need to hit them one more time than I should, wearing out my weapon quicker, which I'll have to--you guessed it--mine to replace my tools and restock my coal and build more furnaces to smelt a single bar of iron over four minutes to replace the weapon so I can keep my baby dragon from starving.  Or I could throw money at the problem.  (The ability to throw money at the problem is literally the only time improvement I'm seeing here from pre-release.)\n\nYes, diamonds have been dropping in-game, but not fast enough that I feel like I can grind my way out of this.  On the whole, the game is just slow.  Painfully slow.  And I'm literally achievement-hunting a game where I'm waiting for potted plants to grow, but at least I can leave that up and switch to another window.  Considering that we're supposedly able to take or leave the new pay system, and considering that by choosing to leave it, this is almost exactly the same game I've been playing all along, I'm going to have to say that the same flaws that made me uninstall it the first time around are still present and have resulted in a game that's more of a slog than a grind.  With all the other sandbox games in my library (and with all the new ones coming out), I just can't see wasting any more time with this one.","December 20, 2015","false","22.4"," 75 of 94 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","75","94","2","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenGuy/recommended/270110/","GoldenGuy","GoldeFish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenGuy/","253 products in account","Lets pretend for a moment that you have absolutley no idea what this game is, and the past of this game on Steam (with the developers snapping at the community and refusing to update the game on EA and then just dump it as a complete game.) With all of that you'd think that ths is like the StarForge fiasco on a smaller scale. But lets forget that, and instead focus on how lacking, dull, and unfinshed this game feels.\n\nOptimization\nThe game runs surprisingly well. On my old 2010 Notebook I can get an adverage of 50-60 FPS which is actually great! On my full computer (What I am typing this review with) it gives me about 300-400 FPS while not noticable by the human eye (no joke intended) it still is surprisingly well optimized given what this game is.\n\nThe World:\nFor an open-world Sandbox game the world feels surprisingly dead and static. For something that most other sandbox games do excellently (Minecraft and Creativerse most specifically) is the idea that once you expand and build and upgrade your character and world it will not only make you feel, well, accomplished but also it would feel like it was changing, like YOU were changing it. Here however the world just feels dead but surprisingly cluttered. There are randomly generated building and tons of NPCs but they have no reason, or just feel like they aren't adding anything. Top that with Water physics that don't even move (Which is a sing for Sandbox Survival games like this) and the lack of leaf decay makes the world feel astonishingly static, as if nothing will change, and for the most part nothing does. Although for what it is worth, the world generation looks very nice with long plains and deserts with massive forests spread around and they are almost fun to explore. (almost) I guess I should also mention the endless all that the world presents, where it will generate endlessly up and endlessly down. While this sounds awesome on paper, it truley is just that, awesome on paper, it is impossible for the idea of an unlimited cave system and unlimited sky lands to be fun and feel complete exploring. If there is no end then the player feels like it made no progress, and with no feeling of progress leaves me to turn off the game. Boss monster spawn without reasons and vanish without reason. There is no ecosystem feeling here. The random building are floating above nothing and some features (like weather) have no effect and just look and feel like they were added just to appease fans of realistic enviroments. The world, from a distance, looks nice with a great lighting engine to boot. But, get too close and it's true ugly head revils itself. The textures are detailed and fit nicley for the most part (Some don't blend well as if their art style was completley differnt.\n\nThe Combat:\nIt is awful. Now, Minecraft's combat (Block Story's main competator) is surprisingly good for what it is trying to do, and as of 1.9 is actually pretty great. Block Story's combat however is an obveous tide from it's ancient mobile days. It truley does feel unsatisfying and looks performs more like your weekly Clash of Clans rip-off than anything. You click once and then you hit it if your close or not, the hitboxes make it so as long as you are somewhere near it then it will register which is very poor feeling. It truly is hard to put into words on how bad the combat feels. You tap, and it does it, it just feels awful.  If there is anything good to say, you can spend your upgrade points on damage upgrades so you don't have to fight at all.\n\nMobile Holdovers:\nThis was once a mobile game. Which wouldn't be a problem if the game acted like a compotent 2.99 dollar game. There are microtransactions everywhere, sure you can earn the gems in game (like most other Microtrasnaction heavy games that are FREE on MOBILE) but it surley will take you a while to get EVEN ONE. Over 2 hours of gameplay and I had yet to get one gem, sure it may be random, however it shouldn't even be in a game that we payed 2.99 (which isn't as bad but still) for. Here is a kicker. The Microtransactions take center stage when you open the inventory and start to smelt items. Each item, (Iron Ore) which is fastest item to my knowledge to smelt, how long does it take without Microtransactions? 5 minutes. Yes Creativerse does have timers, however they don't use Microtransactions making it fair for all players. Additionally of the total 25 slots in the inventory to store stuff you get a mere 10 without paying  275 gems for an additonal 5 rows. which basically means that to unlock your entire inventory you need about 6.70 to do so which is rediculous considering that is over 2 times over the price people payed for the game.\n\nMusic:\nIt comes out of nowhere and constantly plays without reason and sounds awful. There are some interesting pieces of music here but the instrumentation and mixing is so awful (and the really bad midi soundfont they used) which makes it sound cheap and really ear grating after only an hour of playing.\n\nOverall:\nBlock Story is sadly still very unfinished in it's "finished" state and with the developers being quiet since the release [Except for a Christmas update a week late. But still an update nontheless got to give em positive moral points for that] and other people slowly realizing the problems I wouldn't be surprised if this game is forgotten with time. And with all of the problems that I have encountered it would probaly be for the better if this were to happen. There are some good things, but they are overshadowed by the microtransactons, poor combat, dead world, and ear grating music. Don't get me wrong, I REALLY tried hard to like this game. I really tried. But, it just got wrose, wrose, and even more empty feeling and heartless and basically pasionless as it went on.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review check out some of my other reviews (and some of my fellow reviewers) at Completing the Backlog","January 4","false","11.3"," 57 of 75 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","57","75","2","18"

Similar to the popular Minecraft (as if you didn't notice), but has a bit more of an RPG element to it that will have you wanting to keep looking to find what is ahead.\n\nPROS:\n* Nice RPG System and a in-game "recipe book" that shows you what things you need to make items, weapons, etc.\n* It's a low price, one time purchase (no subscription fees)\n* It's in Early Access as of May 2014 and it's playing and functioning just fine.\n* I like the "higher resolution" blocks.\n\nCONS:\n* No Multiplayer (yet?) - Everyone loves multiplayer, and I'm not sure they are even considering it.\n* Weapon durability system is strangely different than other games, but it might grow on you.\n* Some enemy movement gets silly especially when odd shaped bricks are around. The collision system is exploitable.\n\nOther Points:\n* Enemy and friendly creature spawns are based of certain brick locations. They make it obvious. This allows you to "dig" the spawn brick and place it somewhere else. This can be fun to create epic battles between creatures.\n* I still can't figure out how to load the gun.

It's a fun game.\n\nUnlike Minecraft, I like that this game has spawn blocks to collect, containing people, animals and such that you can use to populate whatever area you want them in. It's especially handy when you are getting attacked and you throw out a spawn block of a Warrior, Fighter, etc., and they come out to protect you and attack the enemy. If I'm fighting something powerful, I just spam out spawn blocks left and right having an army of warriors fighting for me. :P\n\nThe system in Block Story is similar to Minecraft and also has it's own unique features like learning magic spells and being able to create vehicles and a bunch of other cool things, but there are a lot of things I would like to see in Block Story, one would be to have multi-player.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stoneth/recommended/270110/","Stoneth","Stoneth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stoneth/","1103 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBlock Story is an RPG set in a voxel world. You can explore the land, slay monsters, complete quests, gather, craft, and build pretty much anything. As with any RPG you can gain experience and level up with allows you to improve a wide variety of various skills from hitting harder to mining faster. Because it's a voxel game, some will draw comparisons between this game and Minecraft. Though if you allow yourself to get hung up on that comparison, you will lose sight of the real issue and fail to see Block Story for what it is: an attempt to push what can be done with voxels and deliver an RPG experience in this format.\n\nI firmly believe that such games deserve all the love that they can get, especially if they try something new with an existing concept. At the end of day, enjoyment and enrichment of the player should matter the most when it comes to how a game is judged and I most definitely feel that Block Story is a very enjoyable game. I honestly found Block Story to be personally  more enjoyable than Minecraft (and it's not as prohibitively expensive). Is it perfect? No. But it is a lot of fun.\n\nOf course if you're still convinced that this is a Minecraft "clone" keep in mind that Minecraft itself was inspired by Infiniminer and Dwarf Fortress. If anything, the emergence of this game along with games like Sky Nations, Fortress Craft Evolved and XenoMiner show that voxel as a means of shaping game worlds is a concept with lots of room for new ideas and ways of playing.

Welcome to Block Story. Block Story combines popular 3D voxel, sandbox exploration gameplay with exciting and addictive role playing elements. Complete a variety of quests to survive and become the greatest warrior in the realm by conquering ten diverse biomes. Build strongholds, encounter a wide variety of creatures, battle boss monsters, and mine valuable resources to upgrade weaponry, access better equipment and create artifacts to summon monsters of all sorts – including dragons! Block Story is currently in its Early Access phase on Steam and is a game that took part in the greenlight program, passing the greenlight stage. You can purchase the game for $9.99 and was created by MindBlock Studios.\n\nFirst off, this game is very clunky. I'm not speaking just controls, I mean everything. From the controls to graphics, it feels like a badly ported mobile game that came to the PC.\n\nThe graphics are all around terrible. This game is very much like Minecraft with a story, although that story very much feels like an MMO storyline. And we all know MMO storylines are nothing special. Basically, MindBlock decided to give blocks all new textures that look awful. Some looks a lot better than Minecraft's textures, but most of them look odd and out of place. One thing they did add to Block Story is companions. Whether it's a cat or some weird mysterious creature, you can have someone fight along side with you as you battle the odd looking dragons and other creatures that roam Block Story Land. Yeah, that's what I'm calling it. All of the NPCs look very awkward and they cut for some more clumsy textures.\nLastly, the controls are TERRIBLE. There is a small tutorial in the beginning and is one of the worst tutorials I've ever encountered. They leave out some vital controls that may save your life in a dire situation. Whenever you walk, it feels like your head is bobbing all over the place and made me dizzy while playing the game.\n\nThose are my (Andrew's) First Impressions on Block Story's Early Access and it's not very good right now. I would say it's not worth the money but I am hoping for a better version of the game in the future. And yes, I have played the mobile version of Block Story before, and it wasn't a very great experience. At it's current state, I'd give it 4/10 at best.","May 18, 2014","false","1.1"," 29 of 42 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","29","42","0","2"

This was the game that was voted for the most on my group page (you guys must really hate me.) It's a shame that THIS is the game that is my 50th review, I guess the people that read them must love to see me torture myself.\n\nIn case anyone didn't figure it out from the trailer, Block Story is a rip off of Minecraft yet I can see that the dev tried to make something unique, but obviously fell flat on his face. Most people are fooled by the reviews from official critics, mainly because they reviewed the mobile version of the game. Why did he not include reviews for the PC version you might ask? Because the PC version is terrible I also don't see the whole appeal of the mobile version either.\n\nSo, what is Block Story? Block Story is basically MineCraft but doesn't necessarily focus on the survival element of MineCraft and brings more attention to the exploration element and adds in some RPG elements to it, which I have to admit, is quite a good idea but we still haven't gotten a game that does this well and Block Story doesn't necessarily fill that hole.\n\nThe gameplay is basically imagine MineCraft and take out the survival element, makethe combat surprisingly worse than MineCraft and then shoehorn in these boring, repetitive fetch quests in the place of actual quests. I said, each time when I was accepting a quest, I said "fetch quest!" and every time, I was right. Although it gives different ways in which these fetch quests are given out, but thats basically the same way of me being given multiple ways to kill myself, should I be hung,drawn and quartered? Should I be slowly diced up?Or should I be left to starve to death? The NPCs will either ask you to do one of 3 things:\n\n1) Fetch this\n2) Fetch this, so we can make something with it\n3) Kill this, get this from their corpse, fetch it back\n\nThat's seriously the majority of the game, add in some differentiation.\n\nThe main issue I have with this game is that it's so boring and monotinous. With it's repetitive and stale fetch quests, and therefor, taking out 1 of it's 2 elements, there isn't much left Block Stroy has that made it stand out in the first place.\n\nMy 2nd issues is the actual game itself, to be specific, it's a PC game, that was ported from mobile devices. How was the transition? Horrible. The combat, I can tell was suitable for mobile where you hold down on what you want to attack on but on the PC, that type of combat feels floaty and awkward. There is also microtransactions to top on that, oh great. 3/5 of your inventory is locked off, how do you unlock the inventory? Get gems and use them to unlock more of your inventory, how do you get the gems? 3 ways: 1) You get lucky and one will fall out of a tree or an enemy will drop one 2) There are daily rewards which give you around 10 gems on the first day and doubles each time and stops on the 5th day and resets what yu're given 3) You pay actual real money to get a sh*t ton of them. You know that you're in for a stellar time when over half of your inventory is locked off behind a pay wall.\n\nAnother thing that's problematic in the porting is that there is screen tearing every minute. One minute won't go by without a piece of screen tearing, which I assume was in the mobile version so that it could give the device time to load the world,but the PC is a MUCH more powerful system than a mobile device and can load areas easily.\n\nThe graphics are terrible as well. I can accept that if you're wanting to be a clone of MineCraft, you want your world to look like MineCraft, but that makes everything else, that you've implemented in  yourselves look awkward and don't look like they belong in that world, in fact all of the characters that are in this game look like they came from completely different things. The wizard looks like he was made in an engine fit for the PS2, the sheep looks like they were made in an early version of unity and the warriors look like they came from World of Warcraft.\n\nI was thinking that the one redeeming grace of this game would be that it might have multiplayer but I found out there was none. I'm actually amazed at this. It would have made the game better if it had multiplayer because that would mean that it might be more fun if you were with a buddy when you were going out, setting out which quests you would each do but you decide against it?\n\nI find very little to like about this game, aside from the decent exploration parts to the game as there is a lot to explore in this game, there's little to like about this game, save your money.\n\nPros\n+ Good exploration elements\n\nCons\n- Screen tearing\n- NPCs don't fit in\n- Micro transactions\n- Terrible combat\n- Boring gameplay\n- Repetitive quests\n\nFinal verdict: 2/10\n\nMy curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","June 3","false","2.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","2"

That's probably what the developer of this game must've thought.\n\nI suppose you could create stuff in the game similar like in Minecraft but everything here just feels off. Obviously all the NPC's, dragons, other creatures... which are higher res, simply do not fit in the world. Besides that, the UI feels and probably IS like a casual game.\n\nBlock Story has been in Early Access for almost a year now and there are almost no updates. It seems to me like this game is build in a hurry just to earn a quick buck, obviously without any love for games.\n\nAfter reading some of the other reviews I found out there's also (going to be?) microtransactions, which is just silly for a game like this, especially since the game is still 10 bucks, which is way too expensive. If you want a game like this, go get Minecraft for the same price.\n\n","March 19, 2015","false","0.2"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","2"

But Early Access SHOULD be used to make people test the game, while the updates are coming. It seems the developer doesn't understand this though. Its been MONTHS without even a single update. The game works, but it has SOO many issues, and so many things missing that where promised, that I just lost interest.\n\nNow the developer is inviting people for a CLOSED BETA TEST. So... isn't this Early Access? Aren't we paying to test the game already? Why doesn't he release updates so that everyone who paid got this can test it?\n\n\nThe way the game is, its almost unplayable. Early Access games are usually buggy and incomplete, but we at least get updates from time to time. In here, we don't even have that!\n\n\nAs for the game itself, its a clone of Minecraft, but with some new ideas. It features RPG elements, quests and a more complex system. Its a good idea, really, but the execution is, at the moment, horrible. The quests are lame, and usually not fun to do. The construction aspect isn't as fun as Minecraft, and the RPG elements need a WAY better implementation. I don't recommend this game as it is. Its one of the most incomplete and nonfunctional EA games I've ever seen, and the lack of updates made me doubt the developers are even taking this game seriously.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I'm not gonna change this review based on the Beta patch, because I'm gonna wait until the game is finally released. But I should just add that the game WILL HAVE MICROTRANSACTIONS.","December 30, 2014","false","2.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","2"

If you try jumping it to negate the clunky control, you either jump short and have to rely on the automatic manuvering, or both imputs are being considered and it's still slow as heck moving up a block.\n\nSecondly, the crafting window. Kinda cool how to craft you have to make the materials resemble the shape of the tool(i.e for a pickaxe, take wood and stone to make a "t" shape, Terriara did this too in the beginning) but making stacks of material and moving them around are a pain! It took me multiple clicks to get the game to recongnize that I was trying to pick up items to move around in my inventory. And then, either I picked up the whole stack, or none at all!! I tried playing on a different computer, thinking that maybe it was my mouse/keyboard, but still the same issue.\n\nThirdly, my char must have some weird aversion to water, because I always get stuck in it somehow, and die from lack of oxygen.\n\nAdditionly, one positive thing I have to say about the game is the amount of detail they put into the mobs,npcs and sky. With that being said, the difference between thoes elements and even just the landscapes are HUGE. For the first time in my 20 odd years of gaming, just looking at the game gave me a headache(I know that is entirely subjective). Comared from looking at the sky( HD metor showers!=D) and then focusing back to the landscape is so jarring due to what looks like a child picking colors. The grass blocks are bright puke green with little texture, the sand is just tan blocks of blah-ness, and the water blocks are so very transparent with a extremely light blue hue. At night there are many random patches of bright electric purple and green that it's a hard on the eyes(and I play with lights on in my computer room) too.\n\nSpeaking of NPCs, talking to each and every one is a slight variation of "go kill 20 mobs and bring back the spoils". Nope, no thank you half naked dude. I had trouble with the first mission of collecting wood from "trees". The reason why I put trees in quotations is that once you harvest the blocks from it, most will not be accepted by the NPC. The harvested block title has to just wood, not anything else. For whatever reason, I found a lot of palm wood and various other types, and the NPC wasn't having any of it. Having trees drop normal wood isn't a hard concept is it?!\n\nAnd lastly, I can glitch through blocks and see for a good distance, but with no texture at all, just basic colors.\n\nI understand that at this point it's an early access game, and the devs need players input, but dang, one would think that a game would be more polished when relased to the public.\n\nI have little hope for the refund from Steam for the money I spent on this game.","April 26, 2014","false","0.7"," 29 of 52 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","29","52","0","0"

To give you an idea: every day you log in you earn 50 Diamonds (which can be found in game or bought for real money), if you log in 5 days in a row, the 5th day you earn 500 diamonds instead of 50, so you get 700 diamonds by merely logging in 5 days in a row and not playing the game; follows a screenshot where you can see the prices of this in-game currency. Personally, I've never even had the need of using diamonds, as the game scales so smoothly that diamonds do actually push you through the game as a sort of cheat, if you allow me the comparison.\nI'd like to point out how I got my Steam copy free of charge, providing the developers proof that I had previously purchased the game through a bundle, where I got a Desura cd-key; I e-mailed them proof of ownership and I got a key to redeem the game on Steam.

If I had bought it I'd be downright dissapointed.\nI think that Steam's Greenlight is giving way to some awesome games, but not in this case, trying to be a money making machine with microtransactions rather than a game.\n\nBottom line: I do NOT recommend it.\n","February 27","false","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's a shame because the game had so much potential.\n\nI would like to point out that I am not changing my review from a yes to a no because, although it has been turned into a shameful money grab - it is still a pretty decent game. I would still recommend this game, but not for this price and I would recommend it as if it is a complete and finished game, it is likely that it will never be updated.. I would not suggest buying it if you expect it to get updated. If you like the product as it is - go for it!\n\nThanks.\n----------------END EDIT-----------------------\nLove it! (played it on android before pc)\n\nGood points about this game:\n* well done graphics engine, runs at 700fps on a nvidia 660 ti, and even when rendering 3d in cinema 4d, it runs @ 100fps\n* ambient music, based on the current situation really increases your game play experience.\n* plenty of content, supplies near endless hours of gameplay.\n* well done first person view, bobing makes you feel like you are really in the game.\n* very hard to star up in game, makes it more of a challenge to play, personally this make the game play more enjoyable.\n* tons more...\n\nThings that could use improvement in this game:\n* water physics, water does not drain (or atleast it does not appear so)\n* native controller support, it does not seam to support joy sticks on xbox remotes.\n* memory usage is ok, but the cpu usage is a little bit out of hand.\n* general polishing.\n* lack of multiplayer\n\nAll in all its a great game, supplies hours of fun, and has a ton of potential :D\n\nTLDR:\nGreat game, buy it now.","June 30, 2014","true","60.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AvianGaming/recommended/270110/","AvianGaming","AvianGaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AvianGaming/","114 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is basically just another Minecraft rip-off game with RPG elements. You play as a guy with magic flying powers in a land where the enemies are actual 3D models that look like they were ripped from an old medieval fantasy game with poor sound quality and awkward timing for music that only plays for 5 seconds. The only difference is you can have multiple characters that carry over their inventory to other worlds like Terraria.\n\nThe first thing I would absolutely LOVE to point out is this game is a mobile port. The first sign that it is a ♥♥♥♥ game. Second, I've been following this game for a couple years now, waiting for an update, but it never came, or so I thought. The updates did come out, but only for the MOBILE version. They haven't kept the PC version up to date at all! There are features being shown off on the dev's YouTube channel that came out on mobile devices that just aren't there for PC.\n\nSecond, the controls are horrendous, due to being a mobile port, optimized for touch screens. Going from touch screen to a mouse and keyboard makes it really hard to move around in your inventory, proving difficult to grab only one of an item in a stack or seperate the stack in half.\n\nThird, the way they went about mob spawning is really stupid. They spawn on/near a specific block, rather than having the mob spawn randomly throughout the world or in certain biomes. It's also REALLY hard to find the specific mob you need to kill sometimes, so you actually need to check the forums for a seed to find that specific mob or NPC to give you that required quest.\n\nFourth, the crafting is revolting. Combined with the horrible controls, in order to craft armor and shields, you need to gather a boat load of ingredients to put into one square, just to craft something that goes away after a few hits. You know all that time you spent killing horses for their hide to make that stupid goblin armor? Well, it just got wrecked after that bat bit your arm!\n\nFINALLY, these devs are kind of nice people, but they put it all to shame with their empty promises. I have had this game for around a year and a half and have waited and waited for an update that never came. This is absolutely unacceptable, even for an early access game. They have said the game will recieve an update, but they haven't released even a bug fix. It also seems to me that they may have abandoned this game completely because recently on January 12, 2015, they released a video on YouTube about ANOTHER game they are working on. All my hope for this game has completely died.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I need to find my gun...","May 4, 2015","false","20.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have to say this is a pretty good game.  I never was able to get into it on my phone, but playing the Steam version was a very new experience.\n\nYes, the quests are repetitive, yes, there are similarities in Minecraft.  (Though I would argue Minecract is about the creation and not the gameplay.)  But, where Minecraft bored me in a few hours, this game kept me occupied until I completed the quests.

So you may have heard that there are microtransactions in the game. Well, they are kind of useless and they are only short cuts to craft certain items which don't take long at all to gather the materials. I have know then devs for years, and I know for a fact that they wouldn't make this game pay to win. Other than that, this game has a ton of content with over 90 different creatures, 6 bosses, and over 100 quests (in verson 10.0). For $10 this game was worth it for me compared to Mincraft, which is more than twice the price. With more updates on the way, the developers really do listen to their fans.

Which I thank them for. As for them Abandoning the platform, it is understandable, since they have stated they have not got any sales through Desura in a long time. Some people might complain but Desura itself has turned into a burning wreck, and I personally no longer buy games through it, so it's smart.\n\nAs for the game itself, like I said I give it a tentative recommendation. It's not the best game in the world by far. Yet for it's $2.99 price tag it's not a bad game. Building wise it fall behind minecraft and other games, but RPG wise it far ahead of them. And it's system requirements are fairly low. For it's price tag I'd say it's an okay buy if you looking for more RPG aspects then building aspects.","January 30","true","0.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

At first glance the graphics, AI of enemies and the story seem to be an improvement. However after a few more hours play, you realise there are far more limitations. Mindcraft is all about encouraging creativity. But the combinations of possibilities in this game are very disappointing. I am middle aged and tried mindcraft a couple of years ago just to see what it was about. I got hooked because of the games deceptive simplicity, but I have to say with no story/quests, mindcraft was ultimately pointless, except for the challenge of creating wondrous constructions. By comparison, Block Story has quests that are tedious (like going back 20 years in expectations). Characters and monsters (graphics at least 10 years old). Worst of all is the lack of array of blocks and tools you can combine. There also seems to be a many differences on the android version, but to be honest, that is not much better. If you want a mindcraft experience, try Mindcraft. If you want questing RPG, there are so many options now available.

There somehow has, just HAS to be a very good reason for this or I am stupidly blind or just plain stupid, you would think..\nAnd this says a lot about the gameplay... such a waste of time and nerves. I literally got frustrated in the first minutes of playing, and the gameplay didn't even come close to being worth frustratingly switching between sensitivitys while doing basic tasks. What would a person who doesn't have a manual switch for different sensitivity profiles even do?\nWhat an annoying, amateur soundtrack as well.\nIf I am just stupid and someone can prove me wrong, this game will still get a negative review because stupid people want to play games too.","April 20","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
