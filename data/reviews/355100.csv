"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/355100/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Dungeon Crawlers HD is described on its Steam page as "what Ghostbusters might've looked like if it were set in a dungeon". I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I can say after playing Dungeon Crawlers HD, it's not anything like Ghostbusters. Instead, it's a generic, turn-based dungeon crawler with ham-fisted Ghostbusters references and poor attempts at satire and humor. It’s a mess of awkward mechanics, jokes and bugs.\nThe blatant attempts at capitalizing on the Ghostbusters franchise start early on. Each character is named in such a way that it resembles Ghostbusters characters. Payter, Aegon and Roy are later joined by Failston. Each is styled in classic RPG fashion, Payter is the barbarian, Aegon dons the role of mage, Roy plays the cleric, and Failstan is the ax-wielding Dwarf warrior. They make up a group of dungeon explorers who are hired to crawl through a dungeon and kill the monster boss that lives at the end of the journey.\nThe game makes no attempt at hiding its use of typical RPG, fantasy, and video game tropes and openly confesses at attempting to parody these clichés. To me, it ends up looking like the narrative is taking the easy way out by writing an extremely generic fantasy story, while covering its tracks by telling the world they're mocking the genre. Failures in the writing don’t stop there - the developer maintains that the story was written by "comedians" but I'm not sure who these comedians are. They're certainly no Harold Ramis or Dan Arkroyd. More often than not, the comedy made me cringe with its references to Ghostbusters and outdated video game memes like the old Mario "Your princess is in another castle" line.\nAlongside its comedy, Dungeon Crawlers HD prides itself on being a simple and accessible turn-based tactics game. I won't argue with simple. Combat is very basic and becomes boring quickly. Each character has one turn to move and attack, then the typical fantasy enemies take their turn. The enemy design is supposed be reminiscent of Ghostbusters, with Slimes and Banshees as a common enemy, it loses its shine quickly when coupled with the ordinary Goblins and Skeletons. After dying, enemies grant experience points and occasionally drop gold. The experience points level up your team of dungeon crawlers, unlocking a total of 6 new moves over the course of ten levels. Item and equipment management are virtually non-existent. Occasionally, a menu pops up and asks you if you'd like to go to the store.  You'll likely say yes because the only other place you'll find weapons and items is at the end of a level. Any new weapons you buy or come across are usually better than the last; there's never any matter of preference between stats on a weapon - one weapon is always objectively better than the other. This minimalist approach to weapons and gear might be called 'streamlining', but for me it just meant a lack of depth that made it harder to feel engaged by the game.\nDungeon Crawlers HD has serviceable mechanics and if you're interested in what a turn-based RPG would look like at its most basic level, then this is where you would find your answer. I imagine that this is how a 'starter-kit' for this genre would look and there is certainly very little to separate the game from such a kit. The game does not redeem itself in other departments either. The artwork looks dull and bland and its character models look particularly uninspiring.\nThe audio follows the pattern with more unoriginality. The background track is about a minute of music before it loops a dozen times, with a few tracks that range anywhere from satisfactory to downright annoying. I ran into an interesting bug where the music just faded out, sometimes for 5 minutes, other times the rest of the level. After it was gone I realized just how much it was needed - all that was left were the same stock grunts and sword slash sound clips over and over again, while my team was attacked by their enemies in uncomfortable silence.\nGiven how unimpressive and dull everything else was, I would have thought the game would be very polished and devoid of bugs. To my chagrin, I was wrong. In the early stages of the game, I encountered a bug where things just stopped working altogether.\nSummarizing, the game lacks any uniqueness and slams itself straight into the boring category in almost every aspect. I cannot help but feel that the "Ghostbusters" parts were slapped on as a marketing trick to draw people in. The use of "satire" feels like a blatant attempt to sidestep criticism on some very poor writing. I could be misjudging the game's intent but parody and satire are no alibi for poor writing and game design. Dungeon Crawlers HD is riddled with bugs, cursed with a lame narrative, and let down by lackluster combat. If you play long enough to get past the boredom, you'll only find frustration.\n","August 14, 2015","false","22.2"," 72 of 84 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","72","84","4","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Negark/recommended/355100/","Negark","Negark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Negark/","320 products in account","Dungeon Crawlers HD is pretty fun. I sift through a lot of games, and usually they hold me for an hour or two. Immediately I knew that I was going to like Dungeon Crawlers HD for longer than that. While I haven't seen Ghostbusters, and I don't get many of the references, I still enjoy the game. It's a very simple strategy game. It may not look the best, but it's good enough.\n\nThe enemy variety was surprising to me. When I first began I was concerned that I would be fighting goblins the entire game, but I quickly realized that wasn't the case. One thing that can be frustrating is that there are some bugs currently. I've run into two levels already that wouldn't let me progress further. Because of this I have had to mail the Dev to let him know that it needs fixed. Admittedly he is quick about fixing these things, but not having these issues in the first place would have been great.\n\nOverall I would say the game is worth the price. It's not going to blow you away with dozens of hours of gameplay, and it doesn't have much (if any) replayability value, but it's still a fun and simple strategy game.\n\nIf you would like to see more of the game, here is a link to my YouTube playlist for the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw7LcwDs7sjyU1b2ufL6qY4-TI9k1C9rC","June 2, 2015","true","6.7"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"

The only equipement i kept were the 2 weapons i had purchased. Im not sure if this is intended or a bug.\n\nWhy when i get to Lvl 5-1 the game bugs? and then i reload and i lost experience ? all my Characters have lost at least 1 level ? i only noticed since the skills were no longer available, upon further inspection i lost 3 levels?....Im at the point where i do not think im going to finish this game and will not be able to give a proper review.\n(END NEW)\n\nOn the plus side the DEV's are actually working on updates pretty fast about it too actualy, since the game only released a few days ago and they have already fixed the mouse issue. so for that i thank you.\n\nIf you liked FF Tactics this might not be a good comparisson for you, Think more hero quest or shinning force without the cutscene attacks. This is much more like shinning force too bad that shinning force is about 25 years old now.\n\nHeres a link to youtube that i posted showing the gameplay and its flaws.

I'll keep my eyes on the updates for this.\n\nDungeon Crawlers HD is a turn based strategy dungeon crawling game, shocking I know!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zG0IGXA_eFM\n\nYou travel through top down 3/4 view dungeons with a cast of 3 lovable characters and explore your way through goblins, slimes and... I'm sure other enemies but that's all I saw in my first look.\n\nEach character has it's own set of skills that level up as you go. There is a ranged mage, a ranged healer and a melee type. As expected with a dungeon crawler you're collecting gold to buy better gear or finding gear as you go. The mechanics are fairly simple, just point and click. Kind of feels like an iOS game. It even mentions "tapping" in one of the tutorials.\n\nNow, everything seems great, the concept, the combat, and the overall aesthetic. However, there was some things I noticed right from the beginning that ruined the experience for me.\n\nThe Font - Good lord the font is god awful, it's an olde english style font. Big blocky letters that make it difficult to read.\nThe Combat - I know I just said it seems great, keyword seems. For some reason that pathing of the attacks was broken. I had a lot of trouble at times to get the game to attack. It would keep telling me unable to reach target. I even moved around and double checked the distances, I may have missed something, but I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working.\nBroke! - Yea, I stopped playing after about 30 minutes because as you will see in the first look an enemy got stuck trying to move forward and just kept running into a barrier. Wouldn't progress forward.\n\nSo it's kind of broken, the font is awful and the combat needs work. Though I can see the concept is there and those problems are all things that can be fixed. With a price point of $5 and the expectation of updates I think this will be a fun dungeon crawler. Also, please pick a better title.\n\nFor more reviews check out EarlyAccessMedia.com, EarlyAccessPodcast.com and YouTube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast","June 1, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

As an old timer, I was wondering when anyone would make a decent "Heroquest" game.  I certainly hope it expands with more Hero characters.  I personally don't care for the Ghostbusters references or the attempts at humor, which I try to just skip over.  The dungeon graphics are excellent and will be a nice discovery for those who have long since given up on seeing this type of game reproduced  on the computer.  It is a shame this engine wasn't used to make the "Warhammer Quest" game, which pales in comparison.","April 26","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
