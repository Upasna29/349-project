The more I play the more I like, my clan is starting to grow in power and I am starting to explore more and getting to know the game. This game seems to take the best parts of Dins Curse, Depths of Peril, and Drox Operative and mash it all up into one fantastic game. I love the character progression so much, you can mix it up anyway you want. I will be playing this much much more. It is in Beta but very playable and target finish date is three months.","October 28, 2015","true","10.5"," 52 of 54 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","52","54","0","2"

I don't care.  Zombasite is one of my favorite games of 2015/2016, just like Drox Operative (Soldak's previous game) was one of my favorite games of 2012.  I like how there are so many factions that can be fighting or allying with each other.  I like how party members have personality traits that affect their interaction with other party members or clan members.  I like how elite monsters start sending out scouts and raiding as they get stronger (they level up, too).  Basically, Zombasite has the kind of dynamic environment I enjoy experiencing.\n\nOne example: I got six NPCs to join one of my clans.  Two of them started flirting and married each other, and then one of them got killed during a hunting trip (you can send out NPCs on independent missions to collect food or other resources, but you can escort them if you wish) by an elite monster.  The spouse went insane and went berserk, and the surviving party members had to put her down.  Her husband became a ghost and attacked the party, and we ended up running away.  The survivors became unhappy, one started secretly poisoning the others, and he eventually let in a raid party of monsters that killed the remaining clan members.   That was pretty sad... but also pretty cool!\n\nCharacter creation can be fun to experiment with.  You can select from one of several classes, or you can create a hybrid character with fewer (but more specialized) skills.\n\nI do wish the 'intelligent zombie virus' was more of a threat.  I'd like to see coordinated attacks by infected monsters and NPCs.  I'd like to see zombies overrun a weak clan so they can zombify the population and eventually overwhelm stronger clans.  I'd also like to see zombie squads surround and flank clan parties so they become outnumbered, rather than just trickle individually into their weapons and spells.\n\n(reviewed version: 0.913)\n","January 1","true","154.4"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","23","23","3","0"

With there previous titles "Din's Curse", "Depths of Peril", and "Drox Operative", I was blown away at how unique they were. Zombasite mixes a lot of the great features from all the games and creates yet another amazing experience.\n\nIt is developers like Soldak; I wish someone walked up to them and said "Hey, here's 100 million dollars, make the greatest ARPG game ever." Because I know they would.\n\n\n***For all the newcomers to Soldak games I will give you a rundown on what to expect:\n\n-Every "playthrough" you spawn in a town that grants you random quests, both main quests and optional quests. While you are hunting and doing quests, AI controlled clans are also doing the same quests in the same zones. The entire world is DYNAMIC. If an enemy clan kills a boss before you, quest failed.\n\n-Factor in bosses and enemies being dynamic as well. Bosses get promoted to become stronger and certain enemies can take over zones and become stronger.\n\n-Factor in "followers" which are random adventurers you find while exploring to join your party and/or your clan to protect your city from invasion.\n\n-Factor in these "followers" gaining levels and having random skills to use like you. As well as being fully equipped with items. You can also send your followers on scavenger hunts for food and potions.\n\n-Factor in endless replayability in many forms. When you create a character, you can activate many different difficult challenges that make the game different. Maybe a mode where you can ONLY equip artifact or above items.\n\n-Factor in full customization via simple mods. If you think experience gain is too slow or too fast, you can reduce it via a text file. If you want the base run speed to be faster, you can edit the text file. Or if you think the base game is just right, don't touch anything.\n\n-Factor in online multiplayer.\n\nOne of the greatest ARPG's ever.\n\nA+++\n11/10","October 14, 2015","true","14.2"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

I'm not convinced.  Graphics have never been a feature of Soldak games but its about time they advanced.  The whole quests / rep system / npc system was way ahead of the pack but again I dont see that it had advanced.  I bought into this on the strength of the last games - I expected more than what appears to be the same character classes from Dins Curse with the same skills / limitations .  Perhaps a lack of imagination on my part but I would have liked to seen more modern character classes.  I suppose if it isnt broke don't fix it but at the moment I'm disappointed.\n\nOn the recommendation...if you are really into the crafting / survival element of a game then perhaps choose this over Dins' Curse / Demon War - but otherwise I'd pick up the latter.\n\nHopefully I'll change my mind as the game matures and I play more.","January 8","false","15.3"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","1"

Thank you Soldak for helping me escape just when I had needed you.  Thank you.\n\n9/10 (EA Placeholder, will review properly later.)\n\nIn all honesty, if you don't like Soldak brand of action RPGs then you probably won't change your mind for this.  The textures and graphics are slightly improved (at the cost of poor optimization in beta, but I'm sure that'll get ironed out as things progress).\n\nOn the other hand, if you do like the very unique concepts that Soldak brings to the action RPG genre, this is the next best iteration in their succession of games.  You have clans, one of which is headed by the player character, and you complete quests for your own clan as well as others (if you want to stay on their good side).  In 4x strategy fashion you'll want to choose your friends carefully, and let the troublesome clans suffer through their problems.  Then again, that might lead to an early raid on your own settlement, or one of your friends, at which point you'll be forced into a bad situation  that will probably result in many deaths, or just one in the case of hardcore characters.\n\nYou have a great and inspired class skill tree, which offers as many combinations as are listed on the tin.  Powerful traits are added to mix things up even more, adding a layer of progression that is common to all classes, and can make your character's skillset,  in tandem with their equipment, very unique.\n\nIn short, so far it's looking so good for Soldak's new RPG, and it is as true an RPG as is being made these days, with meaningful choices that impact gameplay.  RPGs are games of choice, afterall.","October 17, 2015","true","51.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Tons of good ideas, borrowed from various game genres. But skill trees and fighting are plagued by huge negative points (imho), and since we're talking about a hack'n'slash, that's a deal breaker.\n\n\nPositive:\nLike in many other games of this developper, there are a lot of good ideas:\n- Living map/quest system\n- Customizable difficulty\n- The zombie parameter is actually quite interesting\n- Tons of loot of various rarity levels.\n- 4 victory conditions / map is another good idea.\n- Being able to opt for a hybrid class (at a cost) is cool.\n\nBUT the negative points are a deal breaker IMHO.\nNegative:\n- Skill trees and whole classes need a lot of refining. Some skills are clearly useless. Others are incredibly strong, like, only interesting skill in the tree. Some scale terribly, and are useless quite rapidly, no matter how many points you invest in them. A few actually get worse with the scaling. Attack and cast speed are also weird. A lot of potential builds are non-viable because of all of this.\n\n- Action itself isn't really dynamic. Compared to other hack'n'slashes like Path of Exile or Grim Dawn, this is shocking. You cannot "feel" your power. You are auto-attacking A LOT, and many skills feel exactly like an auto-attack. AoE skills are scarce, meaning it takes a lot of time to clean trash mobs.\n\n- Vocabulary is not really accurate. Again, compared to PoE, where a specific word means a very specific thing, here, you regularly wonder how do things stack together.\n- Oh, and visuals are dated. Not really a deal breaker, but one could expect a bit better.","November 26, 2015","false","6.3"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

It draws on the lessons learned from previous games, adds a healthy dose of zombie apocalypse, and mixes it into a nice cocktail. It mixes Din's Curse's Action-RPG combat and dungeon crawling, Depths of Peril's clans and outside world, with Drox Operative's diplomacy and mission system.\n\nThat said, it's definitely a beta title that still needs some polishing and bug hunting. (Note: I wrote this on 15 October 2015, a day after early access was released.) The developer is very responsive and accessible, so do join the Soldak forums and leave your feedback to help make the game better.\n\nEdit on 10 November 2015. There have been 5 patches to the game since it was released as early access; roughly one per week. They have addressed the bugs reported by players, as well as a lot of gameplay and balance issues. The developer is following his own tradition (see previous 4 titles) of incremental patching to polish the game to make it more stable and fun with every patch. So far, Early Access is progressing exemplary.","October 14, 2015","true","6.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

If you do not like Action RPGs or you value graphics heavily, this may not be the game for you. However, if you enjoy Action RPGs and place a premium value on both good gameplay mechanics and customization, there is a chance you will like it as much as I do. A demo is available for you to try it and find out if its particular style appeals to you. The quest generation system can keep you busy enough that you have to prioritize your objectives and go back to the other quests later as their severity escalates. There is always something to do, up to a desperately frantic pace depending on how you picked your settings for your current game. While it is still in early access at the time of my review, it is already a lot of fun. The only real negative I have experienced so far is that the management of npc morale for your settlement is a bit opaque without much explanation, but this aspect of the game is being worked on. The developer is actively using community feedback as he adds additional features and refines it towards release. Soldak games tend to have some modability, and it is likely that a small mod community on the company's official forums will create any tweaks that Soldak does not decide to officially incorporate into the base game itself.","April 4","true","48.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Part ARPG (Din's Curse in this instance), but has a similar feel and depth that old-school games like Seven Kingdoms, Majesty, Civ, Dwarf Fortress and various roguelike style of games. Let me first get to the Graphics and Sound, and also let me clear up why this isn't quite like a regular "Zombie" based game, if you can even call it one.. If you want to skip to the gameplay review, skip down to where the review says "Finally, on to the game...."\n\nLet me first get to the graphics and sound, they of course are not a sole reason you play something like this for, but for me, being an old-school type of gamer as you can tell from the games I mentioned... they are waaaay more than passable! And if you are here currently reading this, you wouldn't be suprised to know this isn't a big dev game, so in that case I think you'll probably be satisfied with it visually. If you are ok enough to ever play a game with the graphics of some of these currently released games nowadays, like say the "The Escapists" or something else visually on a similar level, then you should have absolutely no room to nitpick here. Visuals are moderately sharp and have a good enough amount of variance for any given generated world.  Music is pretty good to me, not an epic soundtrack, but then again it's not too overly dramatic like some can be. Sound is varied enough from the somewhat various amount of different monsters skills, and traps that are in the game, but some sound effects can still sound a bit too loud, so I would recommend lowering the sound volume in the options. This is being improved upon on each version that comes out. The Dev has been updated this game with major patches weekly since it's existence.\n\nSecondly, this is not a ZOMBIE based game in the general sense, not as much as you would think for something with Zombie and Parasite in the name.. Most of it comes from the fact that there are zombie based versions of monsters, and this also causes a lot of in-fighting  between monsters. But even regular monsters can declare war on each other, yeah it's pretty crazy! Though, there is a Zombie threat bar on the bottom, that will go up over time and make more zombie based monsters exist in the world causing havok, which you can slow it's rate of raising by doing certain quests. And you and your clan members can be infected, and this can be taken care of in various ways. Now it's basically a single dev game for the most part, so I know it can't be easy, but in my opinion I think he could have done better job coming up with the name of this game, marketing wise. I think it should be changed to something like "Perils of Survival", to give a better feel for the actual game. Though that name would be similar to "Depths of Peril", a previous game by this company.\n\n----------------------\n\nFinally, on to the game.... You create a character that levels up and gains skills, that you can keep playing through each game (generated world) you play, win or lose, and each game takes usually takes a few hours or more (this may vary by the world generation settings you set). It does have hardcore and semi-hardcore options.\n\nSo what is it generally like? It is beyond just another ARPG/Diablo clone, and like just like a lot of roguelikes, everything you do in game (for this game, doing quests/defending/raiding/diplomacy/clan member management), feels like it's for an important purpose or actual incentive to your clan or the game world.. The world moves even without any user intervention, as monsters level up and form factions to group up with another. And they even plot to raid your town or cause some form of trouble for you or other clans. A certain type of monster, say Imps or Orcs for instance, could actually go to war with you if you kill too many at once (think they will just let you just keep farming them, hey why shouldn't they fight back??)\n\nYou are considered a "clan" leader basically, with a home town (just one town inside walls, that doesn't ever expand in area) that has to win a generated world via one of these victory conditions, that are basically: Last clan alive victory, an Alliance victory, a gather enough food supply victory, or a do all quests victory.... all against actual other competing AI clans just like you (for the most part..).\n\nMost quests are generated on the fly as you play, such as to collect such and such to fix a clan's poisioned water supply, or a town's curse. You can pay for rumors for somewhat accurate locations of these quests. Also quests like "to kill a certain powerful enemy(s) threatening to eventually cause trouble for a clan" (and he/she will, they are not BS'ing!). Escort, rescue, stop a zombie uprising, and many more types of quests that have been added since early access has been moving forward. You can turn in quests that other AI clans give out, quests that they don't end up finishing yet themselves (and you may even do some quests via chance without knowing, before you even meet these clans for the first time... and after you finally meet them, you can turn them in and get rewarded with XP/gold and improved relations) Doing quests for them is a great way to improve relations\n\nYou also have clan members that interact with each other, and have personality traits. You have to manage this a bit and it can be fun, interesting, and at times frustrating at times, like when people go insane. But that's part the challenge and varience this game has that I like. You have to make sure to only recruit people that will probably tolerate each other enough, and you also migh need to help them tolerate each other. And you have to make sure they get fed, and don't hiring way too many clan members if you don't have enough extra food, as this can cause a domino effect of happiness and insanity issues.\n\nTo sum it up, to me It feels weird, in a very GOOD way, playing an action RPG type game. Where you feel an actual pressure to actually get XP, Gold, and also manage just enough various other things, to actually improve your chances of not losing and failing a given world/game. It's not super intense like a MOBA or most FPS games, it's more so a similar feeling some older unique games of the past, and a lot of rougelike type games I've played before, give me.\n\nI also need to mention, there are SO many things that can be modified in the game with notepad via the Assets4 file, for you to tinker with if you'd like. There are mods already if you search the official game forums. Say for example, if you are bothered by lack of inventory space in early levels in ARPG games like this, and would like more in the earlier levels.\n\nI urge people to give it a shot with the demo, and I recommend at first trying low stress mode at first. It can probably use just a bit more feedback before it officially releases in the coming months, but don't get me wrong, it's great just the way it is, even if released now. I don't think there is any game quite like this that exists.","June 4","true","399.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yeah I know zombie+parasite but it's still a horrible name for a game, also I fail to see the difference of zombasite from your typical zombie virus\n-Horrible graphics, effects, sound and music. This is still in early access but they haven't changed their engine from Din's Curse everything looks like an early 90's game. Compare this to torchlight 2 or Titan Quest or Diablo 2 those games look way better even if they're really old now.\n-Map is confusing, since the setting is "Jungle" you have lot of fauna however this makes it hard to see where the places you can go since everything has leaves in the background\n-Inadequate tutorial: Probably the biggest con for me, yes there is a tutorial page and some context sensitive pop ups but someone playing this for the first time will likely be confused. If you haven't played any previous SOLDAK games sugges you watch some videos on youtube so you won't get lost.\n-Skills need tweaking, the game needs to overhaul their skills because a lot of skills suck and don't scale well whereas others are OP OP.\n\n\nDespite all the cons though the gameplay is addicting, I have 18 hours played but all this is just in 3 days, I play it and lose all track of time. Highly recommended from a long time ARPG fan.","December 5, 2015","true","30.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It combines the complex character customization of games like Diablo 2 / Titan Quest with many Roguelike elements such as completely random world generation and harsh debuffs that can kill you, and that's not even mentioning the 4x aspect of managing relations with other clans that can both help and hurt you.  I won't go into too many other details because other reviewers have done a better job explaining how awesome the game is.\n\nOne of the negative reviews says they couldn't feel their characters power but had only played for 6 hours. That's kind of ridiculous, it takes probably a few hours to complete a world and you usually get between 8-12 levels per world (set to tiny at fast with 20% exp buff), so it's pretty unlikely they were past level 20. The max level of the characters is 100, and each 25 levels you enter a new challenge level. In any case, yes it takes more than 6 hours to become powerful, and it should.\n\nThe only con to this game is it's done by a tiny shop and the graphics/sounds aren't great yet. Get over it, it's completely worth it. It's still in early access so maybe if this game can get the hype that it deserves they can spend some more tiny polishing and bringing in talent.","February 1","true","77.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Unless, of course, you have played any pprevious games by this developer, in which case it's a mash up of all the best parts of all their previous games.\n\nAlthough the graphics may not be amazing and some of the sounds areear piercing, I find it easy to overlook this and once I started playing it I couldn't stop!\nI was planning to play for only an hour before sleeping I wound up finding myself playing at 4:30am and looking forward to 3 hours of sleep before work :P\n\nIn other words, the game is so addictive! There's plenty to do and I love that the world seems to be moving and evolving even when you're not around!\n\nThere's even an element of Shadows of Mordor thrown in, as standard enemies who get kills can be promoted and become more and more elite, until eventually leading an army to attack a clan!\n\nIn case you're not a zombie fan (I'm definitely sick of zombie games) I barely even notice that they are included. They can infect you but it's just a matter of drinking a potion and it goes away.

This company makes a great game. This game is like an amalgamation of its  other games such as Kivis Underground, Depths of Peril and Drox Operative. The graphics see a little improvement in this game as opposed to the others in their catalog and the gameplay has been refined as well. This companies games are a perfect example that stellar graphics are not required for a great game. The graphics aren't top of the line but, they aren't bottom, of the line either. Where this game REALLY shines along with all their other games is the gameplay. It is much deeper then your average action RPG but just as much fun if not moreso I guess the best thing I can say is I have several action RPGS and I like them all. But, I will ALWAYS come back to this companies games because of the fun factor and the randomnes of the levels/maps which make each game unique.

Imagine if in Diablo the monsters could actually raid the town and take it over and win. Or imagine if some anonymous goblin out in some far flung corner of the map could actually go up in levels on its own, acquire gear, and eventually become a boss and attract its own followers? Basically, it's a game where the developer has created a lot of interesting, independently minded elements and then trusted those pieces enough to drop them all in a large box with you and just walk away. You know the mechanics work when you can point out dozens of rough edges and care not a bit about them.\n\nThat being said, because this is so much more than a hack and slash action rpg, it's going to be very overwhelming the first couple of times you play it. It's going to take about 5-6 hours before your brain rewires itself to effectively juggle the action rpg aspect with the overarching strategy/clan management aspect. Once that slides into place, the elements no longer fight each other. You'll wonder how you could ever go back to a simpler kind of rpg. Fight through it, prepare your body, and let it happen.\n\nIf you *have* played any other Soldak games, you know what you're in for. Whether or not the whole zombie mechanic ends up enhancing the game experience remains to be seen, but at the moment it still feels a bit grafted on. It's not a bad addition to the Soldak game structure, and I think there are some interesting ideas behind it, but it still feels like more of an afterthought than a mechanic so essential he named the game after it. You can even turn it off. That tells me there's still some design work to be done.","June 4","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really do. Sure, the graphics look like PSX era stuff, and it takes a moment to get used to the maze-like map as opposed to other, more open overowrlds to ARPG games. That didn't matter. The game took hold of me initially.\n\nThe good:\nThis is an ARPG set in a fantasy world with a zombie parasite running rampant. You're the leader of (one) clan of survivors trying to make your way. This means recruiting new people to your cause, maintaining a town, and keeping up supplies. You have relations with other towns, all of them being other races of sentient beings, never human. You can adventure with them, trade items, declare war, have defensive pacts. It's amazingly deep.\n\nThe controls are solid, sometimes movement is a LITTLE wonky, I have found a building I should clearly have been able to walk through, that I just...couldn't. This only happened once though. Sometimes you run around a pillar the longer way instead of diving right in to the enemy you clicked to attack. Of well. The character classes are fun, varried, and seem somewhat balanced.\n\nThe Bad:\nMap generation is...bleh. I've acutally had it where I started in my town, and the only connecting area had no exits other than another clan's town. This wouldn't be so bad, I (eventually) discovered there was an exit from the 2nd town to another zone. BUT! That clan was warlike, and hated me. Had to start a new map, incurring an EXP penalty.\n\nYou have a nemesis. Cool right? A guy to fight against! One to STRIVE to beat! Eh...it's parked way out in some super high level area, so you have to work to get to it. Not a big deal, seems reasonable. However, there is a thing your nemesis can do...invade your town. I thought this would be cool, have to suddenly pop back to town to fight off some event. After all, your town has an inventory, for stronger gates, and to hire guards. I thought it would be like a whole 2nd character I was buildng up.\n\nI've yet to find a single guard I could equip, all of them have some HIGH level requirements, and the gates break REALLY easy. This means I'm coming home a lot to fight off the invasions. Not BAD yet, right? Well, those invasions start to happen pretty frequently. They can destroy houses in town, and you need your houses for the...bluh...happyness mechanic. See below, in the worst.\n\nSo, with constant, damaging invasions happening, the devs decided that, screw town portals. You know those things that every ARPG ever has? Yeah. You get ONE per MAP. Sure, evey area of the map has waypoints you can teleport back to town form. The maps are build like a maze though, and when you're miles of winding paths from the nearest waypoint, your town is DONE FOR by the time you can get back.\n\nThe Worst:\nYou know those survivors I talked about recruiting? Well, they have a stat. Happyness. This is where the game breaks down completely. In every playthrough, (As of writing this, I've played 7 hours, and started MANY maps to try to figure this out.) all of my survivors happyness levels just plummet. They start rebellions and are generally just agressive little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The thing is, there is no (revealed) reason for this. You can hover your mouse over their happyness level, and it will give you a breakdown of what is causing them to be more or less happy. This becomes broken because, all listed effects are green, and thus should be gaining happy levels.\n\nAgain, for emphasis. ALL shown information leads you to think NOTHING is wrong, but they are becoming more and more unhappy. THAT is a BROKEN mechanic.\n\nAll of your characters have traits, and those traits determine what they do and do not like. They don't all start revealed though. This wouldn't be TERRIBLE, but the hidden ones STILL MATTER! The onlyreason I can find from an extensive forum post, is those unrevealed traits are making them unhappy.\n\nSummary/ TL;DR:\nPotentially fantastic game is broken by a few poor choices. It is in early access though, so maybe it will get better. I will be keeping an eye on this, and updating this review if things settle down.","March 26","false","12.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","4"

I'd put it down to early-access but I actually think it's just their severely dated engine.\n\nI'd love to give this a good review, but I think Soldak has shot themselves in the foot by using some really dated mechanics and then just pulling old content across the board.\n\nMaybe a 5.5/10?","March 30","false","0.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

You can set up the amount of factions, and these NPC's will play kinda like a player, going out adventuring, making quests and warring. The diplomacy works nice, you make allies and enemies (or just one of them), help them when invaded or invading other factions. All this works pretty much the same singleplayer or multiplayer! No "multiplayer exclusive" gamemodes to trick you. Nothing like coop in adventure, and factions war! You can also adventure together with "npc players", through faction diplomacy.\n\nThe whole game is extremely dynamic, while this is not entirely new to Soldak games, it is very rare on ARPG's. And I mean REALLY dynamic, not a quest with two choices that gives you a different npc. You know those boss monsters in ARPGs? Here they make alliances too, so you might find two of them wandering together to face the growing threat of factions. Monsters fight each other, according to races. Your town is under constant threat of being attacked, you gotta always keep an eye for a quick route back, making adventuring unique in a sense that who you left in the village matters  and might die. This is a huge addition in multiplayer, since your friends can rush to your base's defense as well. The world is random every gameplay, with underground dungeons and open areas.\n\nOverall, it's a must have to anyone who likes ARPG's, as you won't find most of these features on any other games.","May 29","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you played both Din's Curse and Depths of Peril on the other hand you may find too little new content or gameplay to consider Zombasite an evolution of the genre, much less a revolution of the genre.\n\nAfter playing Zombasite for about 15 hours the foremost question in my mind is probably "Should one rate a game based on its own merits, or should previous games in the same series be taken into account when rating a new game?".\n\nZombasite is by no means a bad game, quite the contrary actually. The game is best described a mix of all previous Soldak games as it cherry picks the best aspects from each previous game and mashes them into a new game. It incorporates the concept of warring factions that was present in Depths of Peril. This system is in turn mixed with Din's Curse's character creation system where one could mix two character classes and turn them into a hybrid, which made for some very interesting character builds. To top it off there is the ever present dynamic evolving quest and world system that is present in all games in the series, and it is as good as ever. On its own, Zombasite is a very well executed game. If this had been the first game from Soldak - or at least the first one i played - I'd be singing its praise all throughout this review.\n\nHowever, this isn't the first Soldak game i played. Excluding Kivi's Underworld i bought every game and expansion pack trough the developers website, and played them rather extensively. Each game had its own merits and added something new to the formula:\n\n- Depths of Peril: The first game. Interesting take on RPG gaming with multiple factions warring for dominance on the same map. Very basic character design, but the party system and dynamic quests make it an interesting, if somewhat unusual game.\n- Din's Curse: The second game. No more warring factions, and essentially the game game world to play in. However,  the game has a vast array of new character classes which could be mixed and allowed for some rather interesting character builds. The dynamic quest system was still present but felt more fleshed out, so there was enough fun to go around. All in all a very good improvement over the first one.\n- Drox Operative: The third game and my absolute favorite. The previous games were set on the same game world, which we now exchange for a space based game. The character classes are swapped out for a spaceship which could be evolved and customized trough components. The clan system from Depths of Peril was reintroduced, yet a very interesting twist of being essentially an outsider to the warring factions. The dynamic quest system worked wonders here as you were essentially trying to make a race or other races ("clans") win the game.\n\nThe fourth game, Zombasite, drops us back in the same world as Depths of Peril and Din's Curse. It has the same enemies as the first two games, the same terrain and most damning, pretty much the exactly the same character creation system that was present in Din's Curse. Due to the last remark i have pretty much been playing the exact same characters i played earlier in Din's Curse. Not because the class system doesn't allow for variety, but because i loved experimenting in Din's and have now been given virtually the same toolset to play with. The game is not entirely without new additions to play with - mostly the town system and the survivors - but it is by comparison just a minor new feature. Its a shame really - a redesign of the character classes (perhaps some mixture of "modern" characters mixed with the games "fantasy" classes would already have bought the game a lot of extra longevity in my eyes.\n\nIf you never played a Soldak game i recommend you do and. If you like fantasy RPG titles go for Zombasite, otherwise go Drox Operative if you like space based games. If you played Din's Curse or Depths of Peril you may be in for a letdown in case you expected anything new and fresh like the previous games offered.","June 6","false","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
