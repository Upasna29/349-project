The plot, the mystery mixing history and mysticism, the nice touches of humor, the nazi villains, some nice action and twists... Arguably, it is sometimes even more "Indiana Jones" than the original trilogy movies themselves!\n\nThis game also has a pretty unique feature for a retro adventure game : the story actually branches at one point, giving you very different playthroughs. Some puzzles are also randomized. This helps replayability a lot.\n\nBearing with the old graphics of this game is entirely worth it. Unless you truly can't stand seeing some pixels, the dated technology should not stop you from enjoying a true Indiana Jones adventure.\n\nIf you read this, you care about the Indy franchise, don't you? Then just play this. You won't regret it.","December 1, 2015","true","4.2"," 64 of 66 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","64","66","3","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PROMISEDCAKE/recommended/6010/","PROMISEDCAKE","RetroGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PROMISEDCAKE/","155 products in account","For starters, I was not born around the time of old point and click adventures like LucasArts', but i would imagine that many people played them. why? Because LucasArts made what are quite possibly the best story driven point and click games. Where to begin? The graphics are as they were 20 years ago, and yet they still feel fresh, so nostalgia will hit hard with older gamers. I have not played the original, so I am not sure if this version is different in any way, but it has the original music, voice acting and graphics, so I assume it's the same. Even though i was born around the time where they started moving on to making more Star Wars games (which were mostly good, and one of them is one of my most favourite games of all time), I still wanted to try these. Last year, I saw a show with a segment about LucasArts' history, and they talked about games like Loom, Indiana Jones And the Fate Of Atlantis, Full Throttle, The Secret Of Monkey Island and many more. And I always like games with a big focus on story lines, and I decided to try them since it would be a break from Call Of Judy or whatever generic shooters are called these days. So I found a bundle with a few of LucasArts' games, and while the controls are a bit fiddly at first, I think Loom, The Dig and Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis will keep me playing 'till the credits roll because of the stories that just make you reflect after the end. It's like reading a book, you say you will read one chapter, and then you read the whole book. It's games like these that make me wish I was born in 1990. Nowadays it's all about pwning n00bs in halozone with masterchef or something. Sorry for the long review about me saying how much i like the stories in these games, But after all, the one thing that sticks around in your mind about a game, is it's story. Thank you for reading.\n\nEdit: Another thing about their games, is that the writing is so good, It's always full of humour.","February 23, 2014","true","1.9"," 64 of 70 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","64","70","2","4"

The game looks great, for a classic LucasArt adventure game, and the voice acting is actually pretty spot on.  The puzzles can be a bit challenging, but luckily there isn't a moment where you have to start the game over because you didn't get that one item you were supposed to get in the last section (Shame on you, Last Crusade). Also, there are three different paths to beat this game: the Team Path, The Wits Path, or The Fists Path. I personally chose the Team Path, because then the puzzles aren't too demanding, since you have help, and you don't have to worry about the fighting system. Also, Indy has to have his lady :). The fighting system is greatly improved from Indy's Last Crusade, but thats really not saying much, since it couldn't have gotten worse. Not only are there multiple ways to accomplish tasks, but there are two different endings, depending on what kind of Indy you want to be. Overrall, this was a great game, that I know I will play again for the different paths. OH, and different paths mean visiting different locations!\nHonestly, this should have been the fourth movie. They would have to have tweaked it just a bit, but this should have been the film. The love/hate relationship between Indy and Sophia is real and genuine (I loved seeing Indy grab her for that "we saved the world from the Nazis kiss"). Also, its Indy against the Nazis, the ones we love to see him fight. The script is strong and believable.  Just a fun great game that all adventure gamers should pick up, at any cost.\n\nUPDATE: My play time is not accurate, since I played this game on the SCUMM engine. I used my Steam file and loaded it to SCUMM, which greatly improves how it looks and sounds. My overrall playtime would be between 6-7 hours for a first time.","January 6","true","4.8"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","29","33","8","3"

Indy is in rare form searching for the lost city and his wit always delivers.  He races against the Nazis (again) to locate Atlantis, which they believe is the source of "orichalcum" - a metal that produces immense energy at no cost and could potentially be used for war power.\n\nDuring the first part of the game he is accompanied by the lovely psychic Sophia Hapgood, who provides him with acerbic banter.  The second part of the game allows you to choose one of three paths:  1) Wits, 2) Fists, or 3) Teamwork.  Each path is completely different and invites you to replay the game each way.  Wits and Teamwork are my favorite.\n\nIn sum, "I think it's mayonnaise, but it looks like used motor oil."","November 22, 2014","true","8.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

But I freaking love this game. Such a smart, exciting game to play with witty dialog and inspired locations. Definitley an old school vibe, which I am assuming you're looking for if you are reading this in the first place. Look no further. I'd play a game like this in heartbeat if LucasArts, SCUMM, or anyone kept producing them.\nAnyways, there *are* two major concerns for anyone wondering (this is my attempt at writing an unbiased review). One is the voice acting, which I didn't remember from my floppy disk copies when I was a kid. But you can mute them, or better yet laugh at the horribly outrageous "German" and "French" accents. Perhaps the worst are the "Arabic" accents although I confess I only heard one, cringed too hard at the delivery, and promptly muted the voice volume in the preferences section, whish I was relieved to find was possible because the background music is a definate selling point (especially the syncopated Indiana Jones theme, somewhat Atari-fied like it belongs in a pokemon game). The other main problem is the fighting mechanism, which is complicated, or, rather, just not fun.\nAnyway, plenty of puzzles, hours of gametime, total replayability (hell, I for one attest to fifteen-years-later replayability). Please play this with your young son. Haven't even mentioned THREE DIFFERENT storylines to make it to Atlantis, with varying character allegiances, settings, and of course puzzles. Still haven't mentioned the art direction, perhaps the most understated selling point I've found when reading the other reviews. And multiple endings depending on prior actions once you make it to Atlantis. Refreshing alternative to the brainless droll of shooter games that seem to dominate the market (not that there's anything wrong with brainless droll). What happened to point and click adventure games? In a way they are to my generation as the Saturday Morning Matinee serials that inspired Dr. Jones in the first place, lost to an earlier period but their appeal lingers. And and Indiana Jones adventure is the perfect fit for this genre. Campy, but in a unique and exciting way. Plot twists a plenty. Sigh, writing this makes me want to explore the Labyrynth of Minos again.

Back then, I relied heavily on the Hint Book that came with the CD; then again, I was also 8 years old.\n\nThere are 3 paths that one can "choose" from based on early actions and dialogue in the game: The Fists Path, the Team Path, and the Wits Path. My favorite of these three is the Team Path, simply because it seems to provide situations privy to having the largest amount of sarcastic dialogue classic to the Indiana Jones franchise. It's the only path where Sophia Hapgood (the female character) joins you for the entire time, and thus gives you an AI teammate (who has a witty demeanor quite similar to that of Marion Ravenwood).\n\nI always feel like dialogue is the most enjoyable part of a point and click style game - especially the old DOS ones - and can definitely make or break it. This is one of my favorite games for this reason; it does a very good job staying true to the feel of the movies and really deserves it's unnoficial title of Indiana Jones 4.\n\nIf you're looking for a fast paced adventure game, this is not it. While a lot of the puzzler-type aspects can be very difficult without the use of the Hint Guide (obviously not included on Steam), fighting is optional and with the limited point-click method - not very engaging, so I wouldn't reccomend that. The puzzler aspects include using objects with one another from multiple locations and working out persuasive dialogue paths.\n\nAll in all, I would have given this game an 9/10 in the late 90's, but as it is 2014, (but I'm still nastalgic) I'd say it's a 8/10 (mostly because the DOS-style pixilizated art now drives me nuts).","April 26, 2014","true","0.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

This game did a good job with the music score, and voice acting as well as having decent graphics for its time. Some of the puzzles are challenging, and some of the controlls in can be hard to figure out in certain puzzles (e.g. the hot air ballon). This however in my opinion, in no way diminishes the story or the excement that you will get when you're trying to figure out the proper thing to say in the middle of a seance! It of course has Indy's classic humor with banter between Sophia Hapgood (don't think she's in any of the movies) and Marcus and some of the other characters that we're familiar with. Love some of the available dialogue options, they can be funny at times, as well as down-right get you into trouble!\n\nIt is clear that the writers put a lot of thought and attention into ancient Atlantian mythology, and that is a plus. They detail excerpts from Plato and other ancient philosophers and theorize on supposed ways to find Atlantis. You will enjoy the dialoge, the score, the puzzles, and the action that is packed into this game, I recommend a try.","December 4, 2013","true","1.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Fate of Atlantis is a point and click adventure game originally released in 1992 by LucasArts.\n\nThe story and atmosphere are on par with the best of the Indiana Jones movies.  While the pixelated visuals are quite dated by today's standards I find I'm still so easily immersed into the game that I hardly notice.  The voice acting was well done in the original, and it sounds like the audio quality might be better in this Steam release. The music is also dated digital sequences, but still good enough to hold the immersion and also sounds as if it's been improved.\n\nUnlike many adventure games, there's a point where the story can take one of three routes: team up with Sophia, use your wits, or use your fists.  Each branch takes the story in a different direction and to different locations, often not accessable in the other branches.  Kids used to spread rumors of a different ending as well, but to my knowlege, no such thing exists.  The mechanics are based on selecting one of the nine pre-selected verbs and clicking something in the world that you want to act that verb upon; for example, Using "Pick Up" on "Ancient Artifact".\n\nIf you love point and click adventure games, and somehow passed this one by, I'd say you're in for a treat as Fate of Atlantis is one of the best, if not THE best.  Yeah, I went there.","March 10, 2014","true","18.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The multiple paths do give the game a lot of replay value which is rather rare in old style pointandclicks. The story is typical Indiana Jones, looking for an ancient long lost something or other with a beautiful woman by his side or kidnapped by Nazis. Some of the puzzles are really obscure and I needed to use a guide for, which lost the game points coz I think if the answer is too hard to figure out for a (self appointed) veteran of these games, then the solution is far-fetched.

Ebay then filled with "last Wispa from vending machines" for large fee.\n\nSteam then say "We will sell Wispa again" which made people lick lips and claim they cannot wait...\n\nI buy Wispa, and it look like a Wispa but taste I do not remember being same.

The puzzles are tricky and hard to figure out, but never unfair. Exploring is also fun, given the great variety of environments you encounter.

I bought it on Steam because of the fond memories I have of playing it back then, and it's always been my favorite Lucas Arts title.  Being an adventure game, the pace is usually whatever you happen to play it as.  In addition, it was one of the earlier popular titles that featured a choice of play styles- one can choose fairly early on to play the puzzle, teamwork, or action pathways.\nThere are some things to poke holes in it.  The graphics are clearly from the early 90s and haven't held up as well as I'd hoped, although they are still servicable.  Some of the backgrounds are actually quite well done and it's only in detailed images that the quality is lacking.  In addition, the voice acting is not that good.  Since the subtitles are defaulted to on, though, one can simply put on some music and mute the actual game.\nThe biggest problem is that the controls on the Steam version don't work as well as those in the original version.  Since most of the time, you're simply going to be pointing and clicking, it doesn't make much difference.  However, fight sequences (which are much more common on the action pathway) may be difficult until you get the hang of the odd control scheme.\nThose issues aside, the story is comparable to the movies (and better than Crystal Skull).  Most players will likely be able to complete a playthrough in several hours, but there is a save game feature should you need multiple sittings.  This is a fun game that all adventure game fans should at least try out.","October 26, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Much like Point 'n Click games, I have a love-hate relationship with Indiana Jones. I love the movies, but hate the video games. Out of all the Indiana Jones games I've played, this and Staff of Kings were the only good ones. Coincidentally, I first played through Fate of Atlantis as part of the Wii version of Staff of Kings\n\nThe game captures the wonder and sense of discovery that the films have, and combine them with the quirkiness and lovable charm of other LucasArts Point 'n Click games (Monkey Island, Sam & Max, etc.). The iMuse music system is solid, giving ambient tone and texture to every area. The voice cast is great, featuring LucasArts veterans like Nick Jameson. Doug Lee does a great job as Indy, though his voice could be a better impression of him.\n\nThe game play is your standard affair of pointing at stuff and clicking on said stuff to solve puzzles. While fun and well paced, the game suffers from the problem that afflicts all early Point 'n Click games. Every puzzle has one and only one solution. I understand that this is likely to prevent logical fallacies and game killing bugs, but some of the puzzle solutions are so obscure and strange that it borders on the completely frustrating. When it comes to difficulty in games, there's a magical "butter-zone" where the game is frustrating enough to taunt you, but not so frustrating as to make you rage quit. You know a game is in that magical zone when you want to beat the game to teach it a lesson. This game (as well as other Point 'n Click games) has a hard time finding that "butter-zone" due to its slow pacing, but it comes closer than other games like Uninvited and Deja Vu.\n\nIf you love Point 'n Click games or Indiana Jones, this game is worth every penny if you can get past the vices of difficult puzzles and slow pacing. Overall, the game is solid, though it's not a game you should sit down and play casually. Fate of Atlantis is a game you need to be committed to in order to play.","March 20, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, the game has a fully voiced cast, and plenty of action and puzzles to test you as Indy searches for the lost city of Atlantis.

However, this game cleverly adds voice-overs to what would normally be a text based graphical adventure, which was new at that time. This game is fun and engaging until the last few stages of the game, where the puzzles get much more complex and vague. A few times I was frustrated with the lack of leads I was given in this game in order to complete the puzzles, and much time is spent walking back and forth just to transfer items to and from your inventory. All in all a good game, but if you're a fan of this genre, or LucasArts, or adventure games, or all of them, I would recommend the Monkey Island series over this.","June 20, 2012","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NickTheNESHero/recommended/6010/","NickTheNESHero","NickTheNESHero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NickTheNESHero/","180 products in account","To start off, I'm a HUGE Indiana Jones fan! Much like Point 'n Click games, I have a love-hate relationship with Indiana Jones. I love the movies, but hate the video games. Out of all the Indiana Jones games I've played, this and Staff of Kings were the only good ones. Coincidentally, I first played through Fate of Atlantis as part of the Wii version of Staff of Kings\n\nThe game captures the wonder and sense of discovery that the films have, and combine them with the quirkiness and lovable charm of other LucasArts Point 'n Click games (Monkey Island, Sam & Max, etc.). The iMuse music system is solid, giving ambient tone and texture to every area. The voice cast is great, featuring LucasArts veterans like Nick Jameson. Doug Lee does a great job as Indy, though his voice could be a better impression of him.\n\nThe game play is your standard affair of pointing at stuff and clicking on said stuff to solve puzzles. While fun and well paced, the game suffers from the problem that afflicts all early Point 'n Click games. Every puzzle has one and only one solution. I understand that this is likely to prevent logical fallacies and game killing bugs, but some of the puzzle solutions are so obscure and strange that it borders on the completely frustrating. When it comes to difficulty in games, there's a magical "butter-zone" where the game is frustrating enough to taunt you, but not so frustrating as to make you rage quit. You know a game is in that magical zone when you want to beat the game to teach it a lesson. This game (as well as other Point 'n Click games) has a hard time finding that "butter-zone" due to its slow pacing, but it comes closer than other games like Uninvited and Deja Vu.\n\nIf you love Point 'n Click games or Indiana Jones, this game is worth every penny if you can get past the vices of difficult puzzles and slow pacing. Overall, the game is solid, though it's not a game you should sit down and play casually. Fate of Atlantis is a game you need to be committed to in order to play.","March 20, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a start, it's one of the few to be based around an existing IP rather than an original story. Secondly,  the game scores you as you play, with an "Indy Quotient". Granted it's meaningless, but it's interesting nonetheless...\n\nLucasarts has already made games based around the first three Indy films, so when there was call for another game, rather than wait for another film to make an appearance, they decided to make their own. And it's good. really good. If this game's story had been made into a film, it would have been... well... let's say somewhere below "Last Crusade" but above "Temple of Doom"\n\nEven before the opening credits start you can tell the amount of care that has gone into this game. The word "cinematic" may keep appearing in your mind, as the first few puzzles weave their way in and around of the credits. This game is simply a joy to play.\n\nThere is one point in this game (well, technically two) where you are given the option to determine how you want to play the game. You can play it as a standard graphical adventure (WITS path), as a graphical adventure with beat-em-up subgames instead of some of the puzzles (FISTS path), or as a graphical adventure but with commentary and assistance from the game, making it a little more like an interactive movie (TEAM path). It's nice to have these options, as the puzzles and dialogue change accordingly, so it's worth playing through again.\n\nIf you like other Lucasarts adventure games, you certainly can't go wrong with this. It's more enjoyable than "Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls" anyway...","February 26, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think the way these games communicate with the player is off, because I find myself hitting a dead end sometimes for longer than I'd like in a point-and-click, and then suddenly I'll have that "eurika!" moment and move on..

The character-design, the story, the setting and - of course - the humour are superbly done. Even the midi-soundtrack is evocative. In the game you can choose, in which way you want to tackle the adventure. You may use your wits or your fists. If you liked "Monkey Island" or "Maniac Mansion", you will probably like this game as well, although Ron Gilbert was not part of this project.\nIn my opinion the story of this game would have made a nice blueprint for a possible fourth movie of that franchise, well it´s too late for that now...\nLet´s get on with it... detedete detede detedete detededede","February 9","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This my friends is how the adventure that is Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis begins....\n\n\nRelease in 1992 (on floppy disk and later CD-ROM with audio) from Lucas Arts, this is one of my all time favorite computer games. I have a real soft spot for the classic Lucas Arts games like this, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Day of the Tentacle and Sam & Max Hit The Road, the simple but effective point and click, puzzle games were things that quite grew on me... and something I remember how to play (as you can see in the replay video of a live stream covering the first third of the game over the period of two hours while going for the 'team path')\n\n\nSo what is it about this game from 24 years ago that makes it worth playing? Well for one it is an Indiana Jones adventure, it has the look and feel of something grand, even if the graphics don't really convey it, the story tells it wonderfully.\n\n\nThere is a lot of replay value, with various dialog choices that have different reactions, plus there are three different paths, one a team path with Sophia Hapgood, one where Indy is solo and is heavy on the puzzles, and one where Indy gets into fights along the way. While each path starts and ends the same, the middle portion of the story varies.I personally prefer to Team Path, because Sophia and Indy have great chemistry as characters, and when you think about it, all the Indiana Jones films see him with a sidekick. Plus it means taking breaks for some side-conversation and getting insight on what to do.\n\n\nAdding to the replay value is the 'random' factor, as if you play through the game once and play through it again with the exact same choices, some events happen slightly differently, such as herding the jungle rodent towards a snake (why did it have to be snakes) sees the rodent start off at a different point every time, the collection where the Lost Dialog of Plato is found varies not to mention the location (It could be in a wax cat, in a tipped over book case, behind a totem pole), what the shop keeper would wand in a trad for a Squab on a Stick and the combination of the Sun, Moon and World Stone can change.\n\n\nAnd because of all these things, I think the game has aged very well and the same could be said for a lot of the Lucas Arts point and click games. It's why I hope at some point more of them get ported to Steam at some point, because these are games that should be experienced and enjoyed in this day and age.\n\n","April 29","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty much once every year. I've been playing since not long after it's release on my trusty old IBM 286. Hard drive was so small I had to choose between Windows 3.1 or Indy. So My Windows days pretty much started with 95... ;)\n\nAnyway, you are Doctor Henry "Indiana" Jones Jr. And as the title suggests, you're trying to find Atlantis before the Nazi's do. This is one of the best stories written for a game, in my opninion. A couple of hours into the game, you get to choose in which way you'll tackle the game. You can do it together with your 'partner in crime', Sophia Hapgood, or you can think your way through, or fight. This adds a lot of replay value.\n\nIf it's not on sale, it's a really good deal. Especially in a bundle with Last Crusade, Loom and The Dig. Last Crusade and Loom have never really been to my liking, but the Dig is also really worth it. With the help of Steven Spielberg, they've created another wonderfull classic adventure game.\nWhen it's on sale, it's really a no brainer. For less than a buck and a couple of cents you have a lot of quality gamplay!\n\nThe Steam version is not the best. The MIDI table they use in the emulator (haven't really looked into what it runs on), is God-awful. But you can just run it through SCUMMVM, and this works so well and easy. Also, you can play it on your smartphone through SCUMMVM, which I've done for my last playthrough of nearly all Lucasarts adventures.\n\nAnyway, what are you still doing reading this!? Grab your whip and hat and travel all over the world to unravel the fate of Atlantis! Godspeed!","November 26, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then the arcade sections hit.  Move a submarine around and reverse it into the hole with these controls invented by a madman, with no hands, or brain.\nNow naviagate your way through a big maze that extends over four screens (from birds eye view) with more than a dozen rooms, patrolling guards and where you have to pick up about ten different items to be used in various ways... etc etc... Ah, now that you're through you can naviagate ANOTHER maze which is randomly generated so that if you load back a too far you have to work on its crazy logic from scratch.... THEN you get to the end where you need a combination... It was on the wall in the maze, you saw it right? NO Then you get to redo the entire maze, that has been randomised once more...\nNo game, no I don't, I get to remove you from my computer and watch the ending on a playthrough on Youtube to see the last two minutes I missed.\n\nIt's a shame, the first half of the game is really good, but then it falls into a heap, basically when you get to Atlantis it's the worst kind of puzzle game.\nThe movie version would have 2 hours of exciting action finshing with twenty minutes of the hero doing his taxes.\n\nThere are three paths to follow to get through the game with extra locations etc, but you still end up in atlantis, so I don't care, I genuinly get more enjoyment from reading the FAQ's, so in conclusion, Fate of Atlantis can blow my pet dog.","June 2","false","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
