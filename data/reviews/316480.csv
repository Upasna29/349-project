If you don't have a daughter, I really suggest investing in one, as they are really useful to have around.  I've seen some criticism of Shadow Puppeteer as not being a good single player game, and that may be completely true, but my recommendation is based entirely on the co-op experience.\n\nFirst thing to do here is get the obvious comparison out of the way.  Shadow Puppeteer gets compared to Contrast, but that seems to be based on the general premise.  Shadow Puppeteer is no Contrast.  If you want a really good single player game and don't have Contrast, get that.  It is very cool.  But if you want a good local co-op game to play with your daughter, and I'm assuming you have acquired one by this point based on my previous suggestion, get Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.  After you have finished that, get Shadow Puppeteer.\n\n"Damn, Otter"  I hear you say, "This sounds like rather faint praise."  I understand it might sound like I'm not even recommending this game, but all I'm really saying is that while Shadow Puppeteer isn't the best co-op experience out there, it's certainly worth playing.  Just, you know, after you've played the games that are better.  Look at it this way.  If your cat throws up on the rug, do you immediately get rid of the cat?  Of course not.  Cats are just inherently evil animals that seek ways to cause trouble for their owners.  They cover up their evil  by being cute, so that no matter what they do, your daughter will say "Aw, she's so adorable, she didn't mean it!"  This leaves you with the difficult choice of either putting up with the cat which is intent on destroying your home and all that you own, or sending the cat on its merry way, thereby alienating the daughter that you rely on to play co-op games.\n\nIt's not always easy maintaining a balance between video games and daughters and cats, so here are a few qualifying questions to help sort it out.\n\nOf cats, video games, and daughters, which have you had to drive for medical care in the middle of the night?\n\nWhich are you worried might get pregnant?\n\nWhich have given you hours upon hours of fun?\n\nWhich have made you proud?\n\nWhich have you spent the most money on?\n\nWhich would you not want to live without?\n\nI know that for myself, these answers are obvious, and it may also be as obvious that I've written this review for Kira, my love, who certainly places above the cat on the list, and without whom I could not play local co-op games at all.  Oh, and Shadow Puppeteer is fun.  If you have someone to play with.","March 5, 2015","true","4.0"," 66 of 69 people (96%) found this review helpful 66 people found this review funny","96","66","69","66","9"

It's great fun to play with a friend, and was to me surprisingly fluent single player as well. Controlling both characters at the same time creates for a very cool dynamic. I adore the art style, and I think the cutscenes are fantastic. The music is also really good, and creates a very nice atmosphere.\n\nYes, the game has some flaws, but to me personally they're very minor. Nothing that you shouldn't expect from a small indie game like this. It's all a part of the charm, and it just adds to the character. Like how something home made might not come in fancy wrappings, but has a lot more soul and heart than a big commercial product could ever achieve.\n\nIt's a beautiful little indie title, and I recommend everyone to play it.","September 30, 2014","true","2.4"," 57 of 68 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","57","68","0","0"

The closest comparison I could find is that controlling both characters at the same time is like playing an instrument (piano, guitar, etc); you have to disconnect your hands from each other to play them right. It's not something many people can pick up instantly, but after a bit of practice anyone can get into the groove.\n\nCo-op is, as I've said, the mode I enjoyed the most (and from what I can tell it's designed around). It's probably best to see the single player as an added challenge extending the co-op part of the game. And with all these local co-op action games coming out it's good to have a puzzle game to chill out with.\n\nThe devs have also been updating with bug fixes and gameplay tweaks which is great.\n\nIf you play on keyboard I would highly recommend you remap the keys to something you feel is comfortable. But since this is a platformer you should play it with a controller, like all platformers should.","November 23, 2014","true","7.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

In my opinion Shadow Puppeteer should be advertised as a "co-op only" video game as the controlling of both the kid and his shadow in the single player mode is essentially the same as controlling at the same time two different characters in any kind of game. In essence in many sections it's extremely frustrating to try and coordinate movements and jumpings in several sections where there is a need for quick reaction.\n\nOther than that, unfortunately, the game is filled with several bugs, frame-rate issues and an overall quality that shows a game that didn't received much polish. Furthermore controlling the kid (in 3d space in comparison with the shadow) is problematic because of certain camera angles that makes it difficult to know the depth of field when jumping leading to some really frustrating platform sections.\n\nThere are some cool puzzles throughout the game and fun to be had by playing co-op but in general it's a game that needed much more time to be truly complete and functioning.","October 3, 2014","false","4.2"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","27","43","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/torchiest/recommended/316480/","torchiest","Torchiest","http://steamcommunity.com/id/torchiest/","505 products in account","This game has a cute idea, but fails badly on execution. The basic premise is that you control a little boy and his shadow, who are chasing after a man who has stolen everyone else's shadows. There's no dialogue in the cutscenes, but it's pretty simple and easy to follow the very thin plot. The core of the game is the platforming, and this is where it has trouble. The boy moves through a 3D environment, and the shadow moves across the wall or floor in a 2D environment. This provides for some cool ways to twist the traditional platforming concepts, as he must stay on shadows, and they can be manipulated in interesting ways.\n\nRight off the bat, you get the feeling the game is unpolished, as the boy's legs don't consistently animate. He just glides around for a while, then his legs will sometimes start moving. The jumping sequences are sometimes pretty frustrating, but what makes them worse is that sometimes you will encounter weird clipping glitches where the boy will pass through ostensibly solid surfaces. Sometimes this helps, like when you can move through a wall and get past a tough spot, but sometimes he'll just fall through the floor into the abyss. There was one spot in the game where I got stuck in a loop where the boy would die for no reason, and immediately respawn, only to die again. There was no way to get out of this other than to restart the level. And that was about halfway through relatively long level, so I lost a good amount of progress.\n\nThere are also some bad design choices, like the energy line connecting the boy and the shadow. If they get too far apart, they apparently die and you have to start over at the last checkpoint. This is annoying enough as something to constantly worry about, but in one leve, where the surfaces the shadow is standing on are moving great distances side to side, it's just about game breaking, because it's extremely tough to keep the boy and the shadow close enough together to avoid insta-death and having to go back to the last checkpoint yet again.\n\nSo in summary, neat idea marred by bad design and sloppy execution. There's no way this is worth the price they're asking. Give it a miss.","February 22, 2015","false","2.9"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","3"

You may draw comparisons to games like Contrast. And to make this short just play that instead.\n\nIf you're looking for a competent cute, slightly whimsical aesthetic co-op platformer this is it. If you want all that and one that plays well. Look elsewhere. I'd also suggest playing with another actual human if you still insist on playing this. Its not offensively bad. Its more disappointingly bad.\n\nBrothers : Tales of two sons comes to mind for its obvious inspiration. However that game is designed so well that playing both characters as one person is not only easy its required. This game on the other hand leaves something to be desired at every turn. Level design and puzzle design are strange. Sudden juts of shadow will force the shadow character into strange places making jumping difficult to judge. There are numerous “move this box”, “hold this thing there” for other character to make a jump sequences. The only problem is its not always clear what you can jump on as its a side scrolling camera in a 3D space (but only for the human character). There is also some double minecart riding while being chased action.\n\nNot to mention the UI for such things requires the player to stand in a very specific spot to interact with the object. Making a confusing puzzle that much more frustrating. I should also mention there is zero indication of the fact you must press a separate button for interaction with the minecart on the shadows behalf.\n\nThere is no dialogue or voice acting, which definitely isn’t a complaint. This actually adds to the rather whimsical feel of the aesthetic within the game and cut-scenes. Which are rather well done and is my favorite part of the game.\n\nI'd say play this with a young one. As its bare bones its still playable and very nice looking. But if not. Just avoid it.\n\nEDIT AFTER AN UPDATE\nThere was an update after my initial experience with the game. It does address some of these issues but not all. It is slightly more playable in essence but I still cannot reccommend the game as a whole.","August 19, 2015","false","0.9"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

The camera angles are so bad implemented that I just kept falling everywhere. Sometimes, there’s a small delay after  pressing a key and the action taking place, which basically results in the little dude suddenly deciding to commit suicide instead of jumping over a small gap… and also in the player raging uncontrollably as the screen fades to black.\n\nI can tell how much effort and care the developers have put into this game, but playing Shadow Puppeteer felt like a chore to me.

These are unavoidable as I explain my frustrations with the game but, in case you want to avoid them, the note is there.\n\nNothing frustrates me more than a game than a game with a good idea that doesn't use it to its fullest or, possibly, manages to make the entire idea frustrating in execution. Shadow Puppeteer is one of those games. I'm getting ahead of myself, though. Let me explain what the game is all about.\n\nIn Shadow Puppeteer, you are separated from your shadow by the titular shadow puppeteer. He plays his creepy little song and split - there goes your shadow, disconnected from you. However, for some reason or other, he fails to capture your shadow and now you must go on an adventure, chasing after him, to get your shadow reconnected to you.\n\nOn the surface, it's a game not unlike Contrast, where you are constantly manipulating both a character in the 3D world and the 2D shadow world. The big difference is that, unlike Contrast, you're controlling them both at the same time. Now, I played the game with Kat in co-op for its entirety and I can't even begin to describe how frustrating the single-player setup seems like it would be. Just having looked at it, it looked nightmarish, controlling one character with each joystick and using buttons on the same side of the controller as the joystick, except for one button which is placed on the opposite side of the controller for the boy. It doesn't look fun. The game was clearly built for co-op. Which, by the way, the game doesn't even fully explain its controls. It gives you instructional videos on how to play - without the controls attached. I had to read an external guide to figure some of the controls out, mostly just figuring them out by frantically pressing buttons until something happened. Oh, and for the shadow, there's a dedicated "hold on to/let go of mine cart" button.\n\nPlaying as the boy is pretty simple. You walk around, you manipulate objects, you jump across the occasional rooftop. The boy's playing experience is exponentially simpler than the shadow's despite having an extra dimension. There are numerous times that his role is relegated to handing the shadow different objects that are collected over the course of the game. The shadow, however, is required to manipulate all sorts of objects using only their shadows, has a lot more platforming, and, generally, gets more puzzles, as well as being the one in mortal danger during boss fights.\n\nThese puzzles are rather clever at times. Some of them get a bit repetitive, almost all of the game's puzzles making use of the same four or five objects, with those that aren't being very simple, but there are some in there that are very clever. There are even those that aren't clever that will make you "ooo" and "aaah" at the uniqueness of it and the fact that they got it working at all. I was pleasantly surprised with a number of them. I was equally disappointed with repetitiveness.\n\nSome of the puzzles get extremely frustrating, though. About halfway through the game, the shadow gains a new set piece - circular lights. For some reason or other, the shadow can only jump on shadows...unless it's a circular light source, which should burn him up but, instead, suddenly gains the ability to orbit around them. These circular lights are incredibly finicky, sometimes requiring several jumps in the exact same spot to get the game to trigger the switch to another light. Other times, these lights caused weird issues with gravity that shot the shadow upwards, into some part of the level or other, triggering instant death. In general, these lights were a major nuisance.\n\nThose weren't the only nuisance, though. Despite having a simpler play experience, the boy can be very difficult to maneuver due to poor viewing angles. I can't tell you how many times I fell off a cliff because the viewing angle threw my depth perception off. There were even times that the game obscured gaps in fences with the viewing angle, making it look like they were connected when they weren't, and I went off the edge.\n\nI also was largely disappointed in level design as a whole. The sections of the game that I could really consider to be clever were all too brief. The levels that they were part of lasted a significantly smaller amount of time than those that rehashed old design ideas. The levels themselves were also significantly smaller than the levels providing rehashes, usually being just large enough to cover the unique puzzle whereas the rehashed segments would have lots of extra running room.\n\nBut that isn't even the most frustrating part. The game focuses even more on its most frustrating parts than it does on rehashes. The longest segments of the game are the seemingly inevitable chase scenes, this one frustratingly long mine segment, and the final boss battle. The chase scenes lasted longer than any one puzzle did and I really did despise that fact. They're all frustrating mine cart segments that are a bit temperamental at times.\n\nThe mine segment I had issues with was this segment that required the player to jump from one elevator of sorts to another when they came into close proximity of each other. It required you to do this for nigh on ten different elevators in a row, requiring both characters to cross. It lasted way too long for what it required you to do and, often, the slightest mistake in timing could spell doom, forcing a restart.\n\n*The final boss battle was, by far, the worst. It's an awkwardly designed battle that requires the shadow to repeatedly stay on circular shadows while being affected by a source of gravity not unlike a planet, only the circular shadows aren't the ones manipulating the gravity; the object in between them is. When the gravity combined with the slippery nature of the circular objects are working against you - I cannot tell you how many times it took to get the shadow to make a jump onto one of these objects that he clearly could make because he kept slipping off - it makes even the simplest tasks difficult. But then you also have to make use of the bomb powerup, which...isn't affected by the same gravity that you are, as if that makes even the slightest amount of sense. This leads to frustrating situations if you drop the bomb just the wrong way, trying to stay on the circular platform while dropping it off, instead getting it stuck on the platform you're on and stuck choosing between death by explosion and death by being sucked into the gravity's center. And then these circular platforms start moving.\n\n*But the battle doesn't end there. It has another entire segment where the boss now shoots projectiles at you; projectiles that are twice your size and lock onto your position. Oh, and the shadow regularly has to climb up circular lights. Combine this with collision detection issues that the shadow has while on lights, occasionally dying when these projectiles hit the other side of them, and the depth perception issues that the boy has and you have one incredibly frustrating boss fight that already outstayed its welcome with the first half.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a unique co-op experience and don't mind a lot of minor frustrations that build into a larger amount of frustration, you might consider Shadow Puppeteer. If you're not looking for a co-op experience, I wouldn't even slightly recommend it at all. We had enough issues in co-op and I don't even want to begin to fathom how they would be in single-player. And ultimately, that's the thing. The game is frustrating. There are bad design decisions and minor issues all over the place that cause this frustration. It had potential but when an entire hour of the three and a half hour playtime you have is spent replaying the final","September 29, 2014","false","3.0"," 32 of 83 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","32","83","0","1"

They let you test your teamwork and communication skills. Its great way to pass the time with friends and family. Its not very often a co-op game really catches my attention and as online gaming continues to grow local co-op is becoming limited. So when me and my sister played through Shadow Puppeteer over the last couple weeks I was extremely impressed. This is a great, stand-out, co-op experience and developers should be taking notes.\n\nIn shadow puppeteer your character becomes aware of a man stealing everyone's shadows. He fails to capture your shadow but he does manage to separate it from your body. Now you and your shadow must help each other traverse different obstacles as you chase down the shadow puppeteer.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice about Shadow Puppeteer is the asymmetrical game-play. The boy lives in three dimensions where as the shadow lives on a 2D plane. The shadow needs to keep on top of other shadows to keep from falling out of the world. The boy has to help move objects around to help the shadow navigate. The shadow also can help out since he has the ability to reach places the boy can't.\n\nYou and your partner really need to cooperate if you want to progress. Both characters share an equal load of the work. This isn't the kind of game where one player can just compensate for the other. There are challenging situations that requires both players to be in sync and they often take several tries to complete. Its feels extremely rewarding when you finally succeed together.\n\nThe game is not perfect. The physics are touchy and aren't very predictable. Also the game isn't particularly long. This all being said it was a very fulfilling experience. If you're looking for co-op games for PC and have a couple 360 controllers I highly recommend it. This is what co-op games are all about.
