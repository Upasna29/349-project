The Howler is a great example of the latter. It has simple, straightforward mechanics with a pleasing, intimate art style. It is short and gratifyingly challenging without being too frustrating. And there is also an optional Voice-Mode which can be used to add a little dash of flavor to the experience.\n\nThe game is comprised of a small amount of short levels. Most of them won’t take long to beat. The puzzles involve simple two-dimensional movement which requires timing and precision. It is all very simplistic. But if you want to try out something a little different, you can enable Voice-Mode, which will allow you to use your voice (via humming, whistling, or blowing into the microphone) to control the game. It’s kind of fun at first, but some of the harder levels require a lot of precision and it can be real difficult in Voice-Mode.\n\nThe hand-drawn artwork is also very nice.  It is a pleasing mix of intimate, curious, and casual. It isn’t the most refined or aweing art, but it is unique and full of character, and it fits the game well.\n\nThe last thing I’ll mention is that it is very short. To me, short games are great because I love variety and hate leaving things unfinished; but I know some people may have a problem with it, so be aware. Also, I generally try to not discuss price in my reviews, because everyone values a dollar differently depending on their lifestyle. But in this case I do want to say that I feel like the developers have priced this game reasonably considering its length. And so, like I suggested earlier: it is a nice, little game for those times you want something lightweight and intuitive. If that sounds like something you would be interested in, I would recommend you give The Howler some consideration.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","March 22","true","2.3"," 117 of 130 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","117","130","7","3"

Hand drawn art for both background and foreground objects. The later actually appear like paper cut-outs attached to the former.\n\nGameplay is simple and straight forward! You are only required to click the left mouse button to control your balloon (click = balloon will rise, no-lick = balloon will drop). Movement to the left/right is controlled by flowing air currents; e.g. if you want to move to the right, just let the balloon rise or drop to the corresponding current, but beware of sharp objects that will let it burst by touching.\nThe object in each level varies from simply getting to the landing spot to picking up packes, dropping them off and land.\n\nAs much as I enjoy my time with The Howler, there is one important thing to mention, which might be shortcoming for some people: There is NO REAL FULLSCREEN support, that is, even if you go fullscreen, the game itself takes place in a realtively small window!","August 1, 2015","true","2.4"," 64 of 77 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","64","77","5","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/306040/","taylort210","Wagglesworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/","3060 products in account","I will admit, I only bothered to look at this game due to its very cool graphical style. Though, on watching the gameplay video and reading the main synopsis present on the store page, I became fearful of a very real possibility. Namely, that hiding behind an excellent artistic direction is a shallow, and probably irritating, gimmick driven “game”. Not unexpectedly, I’m obliged to report that my suspicions proved accurate, but also that my discoveries come with several reservations.\n\nFirst, the gameplay itself (and this should be obvious from the accompanying trailers), is minimal. The goal is to slowly raise and lower your balloon in tune with the weather patterns, which push you left and right, to varying degrees, and land at some designated point. As the game goes on, you’ll have to contend with the added complexity of doing this several times per level, and occasionally even drop things down holes or bombs on unsuspecting flying spiky balls. Playing with a standard mouse, this gets boring, and at times irritating, though mostly due to the slow nature of your balloon and having to wait for your chance to fail again. Chances are, you will have to reset levels several times due to popping or floating too far off-screen. This is where the gimmick comes in, and the developers clearly hope that people haven’t learned from every other throwaway peripheral and gimmick that console makers try to push down our throats. By using your mic, you can control the balloon with your voice. Or any manner of sound, I suppose, so long as you can easily fluctuate it. This is also where my first aforementioned reservation comes in. If you can entertain yourself for hours on end by making stupid noises in the dark, than by all means, play and thoroughly enjoy The Howler. If you’re considering this as a fun diversion for you and your drunk friends, ask yourself this – when was the last time you were able to keep a group of drunks quiet for more than 5 seconds? If you can’t answer that question, than you’re better dusting off the ol’ Kinect for another go around of drunk digital soccer.\n\nNow here’s my second reservation: the art design. It is superb, often ranging from the melancholy to the downright foreboding. And of course, the Wolf. It really bothers me that such a fantastic art style is wasted on a game like this. Given that this mediocre excursion could be beaten in little more than hour (provided you’re forced to reset as often as I had to), than I would seriously consider recommending this title given you have a fondness for such things. If you can forgive, or at the very least tolerate the gameplay, than you may have a better time than I did, if only for the joy of viewing the set pieces. Know, though, that for some reason the game is limited to a small window (surrounded by a large black border in fullscreen), and cannot appear to be changed. While this keeps the art crisp and clean, I am disappointed that I couldn’t have a closer look at some of the better murals.\n\nThe Howler is based off of a book, and you’ll see a direct link to it on Amazon.com in the game’s menu. It’s a shame that there is absolutely no exposition or plot to the game’s events, offering only a quick phrase explaining your mission for whatever group and off you go!. Perhaps it might have alleviated the boredom of the actual gameplay mechanic to have given it all a more defined purpose. In any case, The Howler is something you probably shouldn’t even bother playing in the first place. Unless you really think you’re going to enjoy making stupid noises into your mic for an hour, or absolutely refuse to use google to find the game’s sublime artwork, I’d recommend you at least find a better mobile port to spend your time on.","July 6, 2014","false","2.7"," 48 of 67 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","48","67","3","4"

It relies on the machine having a built-in audio source. There are no options to choose input, and so if it doesn't automatically work there's nothing you can do.\nFor the main gimmick, this is pretty shoddy, because without it it's a lacklustre jetpack joyride on PC.\n\nI do really like the art style, though.\n\n\nFair warning, I got this for free from a marketing group.","August 14, 2015","false","2.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

(not including bonus levels)\nAesthetically speaking, the game has some really visually interesting graphics; the art is hand drawn and the “architecture actually exists in Vilnius today”, according to Antanas Marcelionis.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=508269784\n\nGameplay: There are two control choices: the volume of your voice (obviously requiring a functional microphone on your computer), when the microphone picks up your voice being loud enough, your hot air balloon goes up.\nAlternatively, simply use a keyboard, pressing space to go up, and then any other key drops your cargo (including your Steam screenshot button, so beware the screenshot!)\nYou need to dodge objects that may pop your balloon, and move into air currents that will push you to the right or left. While the game is very straightforward and controls very easily, it's definitely not an “easy” game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=508264819\n\nAchievements: There are no steam achievements for The Howler, quite frankly there isn't enough game to give very many achievements. If achievements were added at some point, it would be along the lines of “beat the game”, “find the hidden level codes”, and anything else would be along the lines of "high score".\n\nPrice: The Howler is priced at $4.99, I spent only 1.5 hours to beat the game. By my value system (1 dollars for every hour played), this game is a bit too high priced. However, when on sale it's a fair price.\nIn the end, the developers are indie so the prices tend to be lower and go on sale often, you could argue for buying the game just to support the developers.\n\nConclusion: The game was short and sweet. The only problem is that I don't really feel like this game was designed for a computer. It felt like something you'd play on an iPad, or mobile device.\nI enjoyed playing it. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a neat unique game for a couple of hours. I suggest getting it on sale, or purchasing for a mobile device.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=508277388\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update September 1, 2015:\nSpelling and punctuation errors corrected, thanks Angfucious!","August 31, 2015","true","1.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

As it appears, a lot: the game runs in 1024x768, but not stretched, it does a fake fullscreen by adding huge black borders. (You can make it windowed by pressing Esc, that's not in the settings menu.) The microphone input cannot be calibrated to a "rest" sound, as a result my balloon always went up into the sky. With voice input active, the game crashes a lot, too. Which means I had to play it with mouse and space bar.\n\nAnd you need a lot of patience: in the first 6 levels, the main game mechanic means you stay at one height to get up to speed and then quickly rise into a countercurrent to hop over an obstacle. Get the timing on this even slightly wrong, and you may need to do it again.. and again... and again. Add random annoying spikey bits that often don't even look spikey for extra aggravation, and borders you can easily fly out of in any direction to restart the level for that extra patience drain.\n\nI'm tired now and don't have the patience, and that's why didn't complete it and don't recommend it.

Objectives consist of picking up objects, dropping them at specific points, or blowing things up. The artwork is all hand draw and nicely done. Gameplay is literally clicking the mouse to make the balloon rise and pressing the spacebar to drop things. Alternatively, a microphone can be used which simulates clicking the mouse by making noise.\n\nThere are only 16 levels in total and it took me about 50 minutes to complete them all. There are 2 or 3 tricky levels and the rest are pretty straightforward. If you have an hour to kill and a couple quarters to spend, you might consider adding this to your library, although you aren't missing much by passing this one up.","January 23","false","2.1"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","26","46","0","0"

Even missions in tunnels with pointy things portruding from the walls can be found.\n\nTypical levels after the first few easy tutorial levels require sometimes multiple attempts and use of enviroment to the max to get to the goal in time and in one piece.\n\nSimple to learn but hard to master -formula in good use here.\n\nGame is entertaining for small game sessions even though i have my doubts about the 'party game' claim.  To put it shortly the best parts in the game is the unique artwork and world (Steam punk Vilnius, Lithuania. Not exactly a no-risk bet there but it works) and varying mission goals.\n\nDevs have used quite well this ancient game formula and made it entertaining.","August 15, 2015","true","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a very different game from the ones I usually play but after having played through the majority of the levels, I found myself liking the challenge despite the difficulty.\n\nBasically, the gameplay is seemingly simple.  You have to navigate your hot air balloon throughout the city of Vilnius, completing various missions and so forth.  Either you can use your mouse or your voice to navigate the balloon.  However, for the latter, a microphone is required and as I didn't have one at the time I'm posting this review, I had to go with the mouse.  (For the remainder of my review, I'll describe it using the mouse.)  How high or low your balloon goes depends on whether you press your mouse button and how much you do so as well as when to let it go.  You have to deal with the wind currents and do your best to avoid obstacles that will make your balloon pop.\n\nAlthough The Howler seems like a simple game, I found it quite difficult and to the point of frustration at times.  Then again, I may simply not be used to this kind of game.  Nevertheless, I would have found it helpful if there had been some tips on how to play the game, as they would have made it easier to play.  On some good points, though, I did enjoy the art of this game.  It is quite beautiful and worth seeing.  The music was fun as well.  As for the levels, I found that I could end up skipping some if they proved to be too difficult.  Now I don't know if this is a bug but I liked that I didn't have to play through all the levels to unlock everything.  In the end, I suppose that's why I'll give this game a positive rating.\n\nI would recommend The Howler if you want to try a unique game and one which you would wish to play occasionally.  If you are adept at using the mouse, it won't take long to complete it but if not, it will prove to be challenging.","September 28, 2015","true","3.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You aren't afforded any of those nifty steering doo-dads.  All you have to guide you is the wind.  Playing The Howler is all about learning to become one with the wind as you soar around this pastel world.  Its a simple concept for a game but it comes together quite well.  Its a short but sweet ride that should keep you entertained for just over an hour.\n\nThe controls are super simple.  All you can do is increase the heat to ascend or subsequently release the hot air to descend.  By controlling the elevation you will pass through different zones of air blowing the wind this way and that way.  Certain currents will be stronger than other and you must be careful of the potential momentum of the stronger winds.  By straddling these currents you can proceed to your destination or pick up goods required for the different objectives.\n\nMany levels will simply have to going for one spot to another.  Other levels may have you pick up and deliver a package.  Later in the game you'll be given bombs you can drop.  Use these to destroy obstacles in your path or take out the enemy's bridge.  Just be careful not to be too close to your bombs as you can easily be sent floating off screen and into the abyss.\n\nOne of the coolest parts of the game is the hand drawn art.  The backgrounds are gorgeous and rich with detail.  They distinguish themselves nicely from the sharp,clean, lines of the objects in the foreground.  There isn't much to the sound design.  There isn't any music while playing which could be justified to help you concentrate.  Usually all you hear is balloon's propane kicking in as you turn on the heat to ascend.  That being said the automatons and cars really stick out in the levels they're present.\n\nThere really isn't much else to say.  This is a really simple game, one that doesn't take long to finish.  That isn't necessary a bad thing considering the low price point.  Not to mention there really isn't many other games like it.  The unique art style might make it worth considering if you're on edge.  As long as you're not expecting anything too fancy there is fun to be had playing The Howler.","April 9","true","3.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Especially when it comes to wanting to remap certain keys that are to do with steam. Taking screenshots while you have a package or a bomb will instantly release them, interfering with your mission.\n\nGraphics/Art: All art used in the Howler was meticulously created by classically-trained painters. Most of the art was thanks to Rene Petruliene: all the graphic design was drawn by hand, giving it that extra classic, renaissance feel.\n\nSoundtrack: It ties in with the aesthetics of the game so well. It gives it that timely atmospheric feel that just works.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Great, fairly short puzzler that will keep you entertained and frustrated depending on how good you are at controlling your air balloon. Also has a nifty unique feature of being able to control your flight with voice/sound from your headset which I quite enjoy because it keeps things interesting.\n\nCompleting a mission will leave you feeling satisfied and accomplished, which for me is very rare. Props to the devs for making such a well balanced game that is entertaining, has wonderful art that clearly shows a lot of work and initiative went into it, for making something really unique and a nice cross of difficult but not punishing.\n\nAs must for any puzzle fans out there.","November 11, 2015","true","1.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There's the unique concept of using your voice (or noise in general) to move your hot air balloon around the map. The artwork is beautiful and really worth taking a good time to enjoy. That's where it stops. Right there is where The Howler ceases and I find myself completely irritated with the game.\n\nThere is simplicity in the game. You are delivering parcels and you don't want your balloon oblierated on the ornate and breath-taking buildings. That's great and that would appeal to a wide audience there. That's perfect. Yet here's what flubs it up. The wind and weather direction should be something that gives you a slight challenge, not forces you to constantly restart the level because the angle wasn't just perfect so your balloon didn't pop or you didn't fly too high into the heavens. I've played similar games to this before and especially when you're starting out, they're a lot more forgiving with their wind merchanics. The Howler punishes you mercilessly on level 3 and continues to kick you in the stomach with that mechanic until you've had enough and switch the game off.\n\nThere's also the fact that the voice control, even when your microphone is on the most sensitivity possible, will not be enough to keep your balloon afloat. Now I'm aware that the game suggested I scream, but not everyone using Steam is living in a house where we have enough privacy to scream. If I have to make my voice raw to get that thing off the ground, why am I playing the game at all? That's entirely too much work and I'm not getting a sore throat just to play it.\n\nThe screens betwen levels are charming and give me the option to turn off the microphone (your mouse will be easier to play with at this rate, I suppose!) but little exposition except a bit of real life history of the city. There's no actual substansial story here and I was expecting a tiny bit more, given I felt teased with the artwork and fairly let down by game play.\n\nIt's like a really pretty flappy bird with a harder obstacle course you're supposed to scream at. I just didn't feel the need to open my big trap since it doesn't actually help!\n\nAccessibility warnings? Transition screens are bright and have a white light. May cause migraines or seizures if you're sensitive. It certainly brought me a migraine. The repetitive motion of clicking upward gets sore (and pretty old!) fast as well.","August 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

Clicking the mouse (or making noise if you have a compatible microphone) makes the balloon go up. In each level, you need to manoeuvre the balloon through a parcours by making use of the wind. There are areas in which the wind blows the balloon forward and there are areas in which the wind blows the balloon back.\n\nAt first, this simple idea looks promising. The first few levels are fun. But soon, the real difficulty pops up: level after level, you need to manoeuvre the balloon through spikey things. And the balloon snaps on the slightest contact with spikey things, so it requires perfect timing. At that point, you realize the game is actually a lot like an unforgiving old-school platformer game. You know, a game that requires you to try and try again until you pretty much know the exact timing to get through each level. I'm sure a lot of people enjoy games like that, and they will enjoy The Howler for what it is, but I think it's only fair to warn other people about the nature of this game because it doesn't show from the description and the screenshots.\n\nWhat you can tell from watching the screenshots, is that the artwork is very nice and pretty unique for an indie game like this. It's also a cheap game, especially when on sale, so if you're not sure whether to try it after reading this and some other reviews, I'd say give it a go. But because the Howler is not the sort of game I expected and because I simply didn't enjoy the game for what it turned out to be, I can't generally recommend this game so I feel obligated to click the 'thumbs down' button.","May 24","false","1.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Think about this, only so much of the population of the planet are intelligent enough to understand calculus. The truth is, everyone understands calculus without knowing it, along with all the other almost impossible mathematical concepts that professional mathemeticians struggle to undertstand. It allows us to catch a ball, to do a backflip and to play video games. What I'm trying to say is, this game is harder if you think about it rather than if you just let it flow with you.

The game's steampunk artstyle was alright closer up as in the walls or towers but the background almost seemed to fit in but then not at times. Speaking of witch the tall walls or towers have these little points on the sides of the obstacle that just blow up your hot air balloon instantly so watch out for those. Anyway I really did not like how the game was not capable for wider screens and leaves you with two dark as night borders at the ends of your screen which really does not go well with the background at all since it is mosly white or redish. Another point I do want to point out is that you can beat all of the levels in about two hours and in my opion The Howler not have a hole lot of replay value due to the fact that it only has fifteen levels (plus one more level if you know morse code) with no goal times to challenge the player.\n\nEven though i do not recommend The Howler it is worth checking out for just fourteen cents.","August 16, 2015","false","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That being said, there are a lot of games that are built only for the phone that I would love to have made available on the computer. The game is addictive... for the first hour of play. Simplicity is the expectation you have going into this, and though there are challenging points, you feel about as much accomplishment as you do expectation for more depth. I recommend this game as a good game to pass the time. Value?

There are 16 stages, so at a little over a cent each, great value!\n\nIn all seriousness, though, The Howler is an interesting take on the old Lunar Lander game mechanic, but in addition to "hold button to go up", there is also the added challenge of navigating the effects of wind on your hot air balloon, which does get a bit frustrating when the slightest thing will literally make you a splode. There's also a "voice" option where you can blow into your microphone instead of clicking the mouse, but that feels like more hot air than I really need for one game.\n\nThe biggest lesson from The Howler is a hot air balloon is the worst vehicle for precision maneuvering. At least the artwork is gorgeous, though.","August 15, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the Howler you take controller of a baloon which you can controll by your voice by screaming or you can enable mouse controlls and controll the balloon by clicking. Overall so how is this game ? Im kinda mixed on this one. The game is actually fun but its also quite annoying. So first of all the games positives. The game has an amazing art style which is just amazing to look at. Everything is hand drawn and it looks great. The game also has simple and fun controlls but if you play with Voice mode enabled after a while youre throat will start to hurt because it requires alot of screaming in some levels. The game also has tedious level desing because sometimes its hard to navigate because some levels are more open than others and sometimes its possible to get lost. The game is quite short only an hour long but youre time will be increased because some levels are quite hard and you will need to repeat them. Overall Howler is quite a fun game but it also has a few other problems. Poorly optimized port. Its quite buggy as well . But overall The Howler is a game you should buy for puzzle game fans and people who like artistic games. I give The Howler a 7/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/recommended/306040/","snortcannon","Snort Cannon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/","1320 products in account","The Howler is a game about Howling, Where your screams take you through the levels but will this be a game you will want to scream through ? In the Howler you take controller of a baloon which you can controll by your voice by screaming or you can enable mouse controlls and controll the balloon by clicking. Overall so how is this game ? Im kinda mixed on this one. The game is actually fun but its also quite annoying. So first of all the games positives. The game has an amazing art style which is just amazing to look at. Everything is hand drawn and it looks great. The game also has simple and fun controlls but if you play with Voice mode enabled after a while youre throat will start to hurt because it requires alot of screaming in some levels. The game also has tedious level desing because sometimes its hard to navigate because some levels are more open than others and sometimes its possible to get lost. The game is quite short only an hour long but youre time will be increased because some levels are quite hard and you will need to repeat them. Overall Howler is quite a fun game but it also has a few other problems. Poorly optimized port. Its quite buggy as well . But overall The Howler is a game you should buy for puzzle game fans and people who like artistic games. I give The Howler a 7/10.

Simply a direct promotional sale for a novel. When the first things on the main menu are links to amazon to purchase "hour of the wolf" and a facebook page link its not always a good sign. The closest analogue to the game is something like a flappy bird or rocket racer. The player controls a balloon by holding down the mouse to go up and when letting go they fall. They then have to use wind currents to reach a destination or pick up a crate. Its just not really all that great and has to much to do with promoting the Novel.","December 27, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The setting is steampunk and you play as a hotair balloon pilot. You have some control over the upward and downward motion of the balloon but you are at the mercy of the wind currents to move left and right. You will need to use momentum to navigate around obstacles, using the wind to your advantage and quickly changing elevation. The difficulty of the game ramps up quite quickly. On most levels (missions) you will be picking up and/or dropping parcels. There is a great deal of verticality in the game and often your destinations will be outside of your view. Each mission starts with a quick scan over the scene, but it will be up to you to remember where you need to go. You can control the game with your mouse and keyboard, but you can also control it with your voice. I tried this feature but found it less appealing than traditional controls. The game has a 4x3 aspect ratio and is locked at 30 FPS. I suspect this is due to it being available on iOS as well. Given how the level design works they would not have been able to simply expand the aspect ratio. This may be off-putting to some but the game can run in windowed mode so you won't notice any wasted space. In full screen you will have black bars on the sides. You cannot control the volume in the game, you'll have to rely on the system sound controls. This is probably another aspect of its iOS support.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my time with the game so far and I will play more of it. If you like to be in complete control of your "character" you may not enjoy this title since a lot of the time the control is out of your hands.\n\nIf you'd like to see 20 minutes of my experience with the game check out my Twenty Minute Tryout video on YouTube...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/sdBid6_N7JM\n","April 24","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Think "Flappy Bird", not "Kerbal SPace Program".\n\nWrong:\nThe only thing that makes this a "game" (instead of a "follow the arrows" exercise) is that physics is twisted so that the balloon can gain momentum in one windstream, and when the balloon enters a different windstream, the balloon will briefly continue moving as though it were still in the first windstream. Neither Boyle, Bernoulli nor Newton would have approved this game-design decision. It's not how balloons work in air. And without this twist there is no game.\n\nWrong:\nThe player can hear the burn when the balloon is ordered to move upwards, suggesting a warm balloon filled with mostly Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide. Yet the balloon detonates when it strikes an object, as thought the balloon were constructed of strike-anywhere matches and filled with hydrogen.\n\nWrong:\nThe balloon can go seemingly infinitely far off the map to the left, right, or bottom. But if it goes off the top of the map, it is "lost" and forces a restart. What, did it go into orbit? Doesn't the air on this planet get thinner with altitude?\n\nWrong:\nNo fuel meter, infinite burns are allowed. Fuel should have been the "game", and physics should have been real.","April 18","false","0.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That is all. oh and 2 buttons.\n\nI find the game very very boring and i dont even see the fun of it.\nOnly thing what u have to do is, press left mouse button or press spacebar.\nThere is microphone action in the game(so if u talk something happends) but come on... nobody will ever use this in the game. It is soo unnecessary and annoying. I have played different games with the microphone action. those are more fun.\n\nThe reason that he put it into this game is to get a different response over it. maybe a better positive review.\nbut the microphone thing, isnt needed in the game. at all.  You will waste more energy then pressing and holding 1 button.\n\nAlso never press ESC in this game. because it will minimize your screen.\n\nOnly get this game with a discount and even then its a rip off. Or if you are lame.\n\nOnly thing what is great about the game is the Art. nothing else.\n\nThe game has very short levels, and i mean, short as in "completed in 2 mins" - there are 15 levels + 1 bonus level (whoopie!)\n\n2/10","August 21, 2015","false","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And the the louder you scream, the more points you get.\n\nEveryone's all for that idea.\nExcept for me.\n\nI thought it was a stupid idea from the start, because not only does that just sound stupid on its own, but that encourages players to be annoying.\n\nIt's already bad enough you have CoD kids screaming at you online, why the hell are we making a game that promotes being obnoxious?\n\nI honestly hope it doesn't fly out of production. Because if it does fly, they'll probably get something like "The Howler."\n\nThis game uses the gimmick of using your voice to help elevate your hot air balloon and get from point A to point B, C and so on. And the louder you are, the faster you go up. That's basically your goal in this game.\n\nYeah, I could use the mouse instead, but that already sounded lame, so lets go use my voice.\n\nI couldn't stand the idea I had to talk/scream louder than I should be, and it's really unfortunate too with this kind of art style. Whoever's the artist deserves better than this. And if the artist is one of the Game Devs themselves: shame on him for thinking this concept was even a good idea.\n\nEventually after 5~10 minutes of screaming, I got tired and stopped.\nAnd you know what I did?\n\nNo, I didn't start using my mouse.\n\nI got a paper towel, wrapped it around my mic, and started stroking it to raise my hot air balloon across the field.\n...yeah. If that ain't innuendo enough for you, I don't know what is.\n\nThis game blows.\nLiterally.\n\nPlease don't make anything atrocious like this ever again, game developers.\nIt encourages people to be stupid, and you should feel bad for it.","December 5, 2014","false","1.0"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","44","7","16","6","0"

It's very peaceful, there not a lot of sound or music aside from your own voice. Only problem I had was that I coudln't put the game into fullscreen. So the footage I made of the game is essentially in letterbox format (I should have lowered the desktop resolution).\n\nYou control the altitude of a hot air baloon with a the mouse or by the making sound into a microphone. Lateral movement depends on the strength and direction of the air current you are in. So you have to navigate the air currents. Each level has a different objective e.g. to start you just have to fly to the landing pad and later you need to pick up and deliver parcels.\n\nIt's a lot of fun to use voice to control the hot air Baloon. I lost control several times when I spoke or burst into laughter which would seen the baloon rising out of the boundaries of the level. So I had to make myself shut sometimes lol. The game gets pretty tricky fast. It will make you navigate through currents pushing against you. The only way to do so is by gaining momentum in a current moving in the correct direction. I had back track a lot and it can be pretty slow using the air currents. But you need to concentrate to create just the right amount of sound. You are supposed to be able to drop objects by using your voice. But I couldn't get this to work so I used the space bar.\n\nSo it is a really cool game and $2.99 is an awesome price.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 4, 2014","true","3.5"," 19 of 42 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","19","42","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/306040/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","In this air current and physics based game you will have to navigate safely through level upon level completing tasks while on the clock. In this 2D game you will spend most of your time in a hot air balloon where you will have to master the different speeds of the air currents while taking into consideration that air can blow in both directions.\n\nGraphically The Howler definitely has that aged look to it. I don't mean that it looks dated it just looks more like a steam-punk Victorian age type of feel. One of the things I like about the art style in this game is that it gives you the look of a city or area of the city while not overly cluttering up the screen.\n\nThis game is basically played with just a couple of buttons and/or your voice. I know that sounds a bit crazy, but if you have a good enough mic you can issues increases and decreases in altitude by the level of your voice. Do you want to go higher, get louder, you want to descend, well just get quieter. I wouldn't recommend being silent that might cause a not so fun crash, but hey you never know until you try it.\n\nOne of the things that really impressed me with The Howler was the fact that if you had the tutorial text on you could easily pick up this game and be able to play it. Now I know that there are games that put you through the tutorial once and then disable, but in this game it doesn't and that's not a problem. Instead of constantly taking the player out of the game by throwing up dialogue boxes that you have to click ok or next on they put the text into the background of the game and once you start moving around it just vanishes.\n\nNow there is a slight downside to this game and that is it DEFINITELY feels like a port of a tablet or phone game. The resolution for the game can't be changed so you'll be faced with playing in a small box on your screen. The other thing is that as easy as the controls are for some reason the mouse button just doesn't seem to translate as well as say a tap and hold on a touchscreen, maybe that's just me, but I think it makes a difference.\n\nSo if you are looking for a challenging puzzle game to play with some interesting yet simple controls you are going to want to pick up this game. I'm not going to lie there are definitely some of the levels where it took me more tries than it should have, but that sense of accomplishment when you do gain enough speed to negate the wind going the opposite direction, or the precision flying/floating required to navigate treacherous locations is pretty astounding. So with that I'm giving this game a 7.5 out of 10.","August 23, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With a hand-drawn art style that looks steampunkish\n\nThe Howler is simple: there is only one button to control: Click to make the balloon go up, do NOT click to make it drop. Different wind layers (of different strengths) means you will move left or right depending on the altitude. You move the balloon from launch pad to destination pad. As you work your way through the over a dozen missions (and there's a bit of a plot) you get complications, like more wind layers, requirement to pick up one or more cargo packs at an intermediate platform, and later, airborne obstacles that gets in your way. A light touch of your balloon against something is okay, heavier touch and your balloon goes POOF.\n\nThe difficulty curve feels rather uneven. There's a mission at about halfway where you need to land the balloon, with 2 cargo boxes loaded, THROUGH the mouth of a statue (going at a diagonal). Somehow the balloon felt much more delicate. I made it once without the cargo, but can not make it with the cargo after over a dozen attempts.\n\nStill, as a simple and cheap game it does provide an interesting challenge.","August 30, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So far, the first two games just show artistic promise while having actual gameplay about as bad as trying to walk with tent poles for legs.\n\nThe Howler (odd enough name, as the actual Howler is only in the first level), revolves around a city being thrust into madness... oh, you can't tell? The level design doesn't imply that? Yeah, see that's the big issue with games that rely on cutscenes or text to simply TELL you what's going on and not backing it up. It's like getting ready for a dinner party, and your friend tells you, "Hey! Get ready! This is really high society. Act your best!" And when you get in, dressed in your tuxedo, the place is actually a hillbilly hoedown. The world of The Howler feels very empty and lifeless, rather than tense and on the brink of destruction, like the so-called "story" would imply.\n\nI have some humongous problems with the gameplay (very similarly to Gravilon), being that momentum is NOT a good mechanic for a video game. It's simply too much of a semi-controllable variable that makes beating levels feel more like you got lucky rather than actually feeling like you accomplished and learned something. So many of these levels are agonizingly hard because of how semi-predictable the movement of your hot air balloon is.\n\nThe world is designed just fine. I have no issues with it, visually. It certainly looks a lot more vivid than Gravilon, but again the design makes a lot of obstacles much harder than they are. Such as building up momentum to get over a fair-sized chimney proved to be a right pain in my a** after attempting the level about 15 times.\n\nIf you like momentum games, and a decent challenge, The Howler will shortly satiate your starvation. But as for people looking for actual "art"... I suggest you look over by Dear Esther or Elegy for a Dead World. There's very little art around here.","January 19","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is not much to say about the game, but here goes nothing.\n\nIt is a short game about a hot air baloon. There is a minimalistic story which helps to add a bit of something to the game. The art is fairly nice and unique. It seems that this game has a function to work with a microphone. I did not try this. While it may be fun, I expect it to be less precise. The controls are pretty good. The baloon has to do various tasks, such as picking up cargo, dropping it off, and landing. There is only one control, and that is gas (makes the baloon go upwards). The wind currents indicated on the side of the screen indicate the direction and speed of wind. While it is incredibly simply, it probably gets pretty challenging. Really, this game reminds me just a bit of the old game Pilotwings for the super nintendo. It is all about precision. It is an enjoyable little game. It's worth buying on sale. Unless there is a second map of levels beyond the first 17 or so levels,  I would NOT recommend buying it at full price.","November 7, 2015","true","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So far, the first two games just show artistic promise while having actual gameplay about as bad as trying to walk with tent poles for legs.\n\nThe Howler (odd enough name, as the actual Howler is only in the first level), revolves around a city being thrust into madness... oh, you can't tell? The level design doesn't imply that? Yeah, see that's the big issue with games that rely on cutscenes or text to simply TELL you what's going on and not backing it up. It's like getting ready for a dinner party, and your friend tells you, "Hey! Get ready! This is really high society. Act your best!" And when you get in, dressed in your tuxedo, the place is actually a hillbilly hoedown. The world of The Howler feels very empty and lifeless, rather than tense and on the brink of destruction, like the so-called "story" would imply.\n\nI have some humongous problems with the gameplay (very similarly to Gravilon), being that momentum is NOT a good mechanic for a video game. It's simply too much of a semi-controllable variable that makes beating levels feel more like you got lucky rather than actually feeling like you accomplished and learned something. So many of these levels are agonizingly hard because of how semi-predictable the movement of your hot air balloon is.\n\nThe world is designed just fine. I have no issues with it, visually. It certainly looks a lot more vivid than Gravilon, but again the design makes a lot of obstacles much harder than they are. Such as building up momentum to get over a fair-sized chimney proved to be a right pain in my a** after attempting the level about 15 times.\n\nIf you like momentum games, and a decent challenge, The Howler will shortly satiate your starvation. But as for people looking for actual "art"... I suggest you look over by Dear Esther or Elegy for a Dead World. There's very little art around here.","January 19","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only by the sheer amount of detail, you know that those guys who did this, really poured their hearts into it. And once again for the painters wow. 9/10\n\nMusic - Deep and mysterious, it just adds to the whole aesthetic to the game, which itself is deep and mysterious. 7/10\n\nStory - Couldn't quite understand the story, because it is mostly given to you by little chunks of story, at the start of every level. That is probably done to not spoil the book it is based of off/on, yes you heard right, a book. ''Hour of the Wolf'' by Andrius B. Tapinas. (Now I don't know, if I can post links which are not directly connected to steam, I may be mistaken) You can find the book on Amazon, for a pretty cheap price I might add. (The score is based on playing only the GAME, it may change when I get and read the book.) 5/10\n\nContent - A few levels, but as you progress through the game, more and more mechanics are unlocked, which make every single new level, something new to be experienced. 7/10\n\nControls - Done by the mouse or your own voice, or any sound that you make, be that bashing your head on the desk (don't do that) or by breaking every single bone in your body (or that). Press and hold to go up, let go to go down or scream to go up, don't scream to go down. Just by having the option of using sound as a way to control the game, it gets an easy 8/10.\n\nGameplay - Simple, but effective. Also well paced, but I do warn you, some levels need a little bit more thinking to get through. Remember, if what you are doing does not work, try and think of a solution, rather than raging. Also I have a little pro tip for the game, to stop getting your blump to go up from the sound, just unplug your microphone. I know genius. 7/10\n\nA really well made game. Bonus points for making the game small, which in contrast makes the players want to read the book, to understand the story, really well thought out.

So far, the first two games just show artistic promise while having actual gameplay about as bad as trying to walk with tent poles for legs.\n\nThe Howler (odd enough name, as the actual Howler is only in the first level), revolves around a city being thrust into madness... oh, you can't tell? The level design doesn't imply that? Yeah, see that's the big issue with games that rely on cutscenes or text to simply TELL you what's going on and not backing it up. It's like getting ready for a dinner party, and your friend tells you, "Hey! Get ready! This is really high society. Act your best!" And when you get in, dressed in your tuxedo, the place is actually a hillbilly hoedown. The world of The Howler feels very empty and lifeless, rather than tense and on the brink of destruction, like the so-called "story" would imply.\n\nI have some humongous problems with the gameplay (very similarly to Gravilon), being that momentum is NOT a good mechanic for a video game. It's simply too much of a semi-controllable variable that makes beating levels feel more like you got lucky rather than actually feeling like you accomplished and learned something. So many of these levels are agonizingly hard because of how semi-predictable the movement of your hot air balloon is.\n\nThe world is designed just fine. I have no issues with it, visually. It certainly looks a lot more vivid than Gravilon, but again the design makes a lot of obstacles much harder than they are. Such as building up momentum to get over a fair-sized chimney proved to be a right pain in my a** after attempting the level about 15 times.\n\nIf you like momentum games, and a decent challenge, The Howler will shortly satiate your starvation. But as for people looking for actual "art"... I suggest you look over by Dear Esther or Elegy for a Dead World. There's very little art around here.","January 19","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game play is simple. You control a got air balloon that you must direct from one point to another, performing simple tasks like dropping off parcels along the way. The audio is restricted to sound effects which are fairly limited but effective.\n\nThe controls are simple, for vertical control you press the left mouse button to ignite the hot air and raise and stop pressing it to allow gravity to take over. For left and right control you must rely on the wind direction and speed which varies at different altitudes and is indicated by an arrow on the left hand side; the number of feathers in the quill indicating the strength. Thus you need to be at the correct altitude to move in the correct direction. The SPACE BAR is used to drop objects you are carrying and there is a pause button click able by the mouse.\n\nYou cannot pan around so you only see a screens worth of the level around the current location of the balloon. If you go too high, low, left or right and disappear off the edge of the level you die. Similarly if the balloon hits other objects you will usually die.\n\nAs you progress through levels additional obstacles like floating bombs are introduced. Fortunately these move in a predictable manner.\n\nThe only way to play is via a campaign of different screen levels you play in order (although once you have completed a level you can replay it at any time). The levels are pretty small (maybe twice the width of the monitor).\n\nWhen you start a new level you are quickly shown what needs to be done by the camera panning about and short text messages appearing. You have a set time limit to complete the tasks.\n\nThis game play is short and the game can be easily be completed in 2-3 hours.
