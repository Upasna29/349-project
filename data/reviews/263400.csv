Unit abilities can light up fog of war, kill enemies at greater range, self-destruct your unit for a wide swathe of, well, destruction, and so on. Between missions, you spend supplies gained from previous sorties to upgrade and replenish your army, increasing their effectiveness, area of effect of attacks, range, and so on.\n\nIts titular unit, the human tanks, are mass-produced military personnel who for some unknown reason look like cute young women and charge fearlessly to their doom at your command. If that sounds too weird for you, this game may not be for you. But if you can look past that strange outer layer and the (gasp!) DREADED ANIME AESTHETIC (the horror!) this game offers a lot of fun and deep tactical gameplay.\n\nThe plot is presented in a visual novel sort of style between missions, so you will have to do a lot of reading. But there is plenty of (dark) humor to be found, and some surprisingly deep themes for such a wacky game.\n\nAlso, its soundtrack is seriously catchy and unique.\n\nI personally ADORE this game, and if you have any interest in tactical RPGs like advance wars or any other strategy title really, I think you could do a lot worse than War of the Human Tanks. If nothing else, try the demo - it gives five levels of playtime, plenty to decide on whether this game is for you.","January 10, 2014","true","13.3"," 252 of 308 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","252","308","0","4"

The game has been developed by Yakiniku Banzai and published by Fruitbat Factory, and you can tell inspiration has come from the classic game of Battleship with an evolution to the formula. a bold task to undertake and one that has been well executed. It’s hard not to compare War Of The Human Tanks to battleship where you place your pieces on the board, while the AI does the same though neither side can see where the enemy positions are. Your pieces are combined of Command units which if destroyed means you lose the battle,Shock units that are basically bombs,Assault units that are the basic infantry, Battery that can do long range damage, Scouts which do recon, Interceptors which defend your units from incoming missiles and finally the Samurai/Knight tanks which are the only units that can evade attacks.These seven types are unlocked over the course of the campaign, and after each battle you can upgrade them by developing units with more weapons or modules that give certain advantages to different tanks. It's a good system to have because it keeps the game interesting as you decide how to shape your army as the battles get tougher.The actual war is mix of anticipation and luck.In War Of The Human Tanks the pieces move around, so at one point you may discover where a unit is then the next second that enemy could have moved onto one of the unknown squares.Its a mechanic that can lead to some tense battles, but they never stray into frustrating.In fact when you lose a battle it doesn’t seem unfair but instead a lesson, as you work out which tanks the enemy is fielding and figure out how to counter them. The game’s campaign is designed like it is a TV show with intros and end credits present before and after each battle. There will be story scenes before the battle giving both a background and adding more depth to the characters, then scenes after the battle showing character reactions. What I also liked is that outside of key battles you didn’t have to win them for the story to progress.If you’re looking for a cheap strategy title then this is definitely for you.","October 1, 2014","true","176.1"," 48 of 56 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","48","56","3","0"

I'm one of those people who'll get mad and reset whenever someone dies. In my fantasy wars, my army destroys it's enemies mercilessly without any casualties.\n\nThis game did some bad things to me.\n\nOne of the first units they gave me blew herself up all in the hopes of taking a few enemies with her. I reached out, a soft no escaping my lips before her final warcry, a deafening explosion, and a heavy silence.\n\nWar of the Human Tanks is a comedy game of give and take, managing your expendable human pawns in an effort to make sure the enemy loses more expendable human pawns. It's brilliant. I expected this game to start preaching at me about war and death and the value of life and it never did, because the game recognized that those things are probably common sense, and instead we could have light-hearted, yet dark humor develop interesting characters. I got the game to slake my thirst for grid based tactical combat, and also received a surprisingly deep narrative along with it.\n\nThe most notable feature of the combat is that it takes place in real time, with your light, kamikaze units often being the quickest, and your heavy, blow them up from a distance units being a bit more sluggish. The game uses fog of war to keep you on your feet and a wrong step into enemy territory is certain death. Not for you, but sometimes you feel pretty bad when your terrible decision making gets your innocently little scout shot to pieces.\n\nMost units die with only one hit, but units that are larger-and thus also easier targets- must be hit in each of their segments before they die.\n\nIf I had to complain about anything, it's that once you get certain units you're basically an untouchable god of death. When you can literally bombard an entire half of the map with just one unit, you're probably not going to lose any fights. But then getting to that point is rewarding the first time you actually get to do it, but that said, the challenge maps usually laugh at simplistic strategies like that and send you straight to hell. Well, not you, so much as your pawn tanks, but still.\n\nPros- Hillarious, surprisingly interesting narrative, combat is simple enough to pick up quickly and deep enough to stay interesting for the long haul.\n\nCons- Some of the sound effects (mostly death cries) get annoying pretty quickly, not too hard to get over-powered, and I wish there was a competitive multiplayer mode, even if it was just local.\n\n5/5\n\nAs a final note, this game has a demo, so there's no reason not to at least give it a try.","December 29, 2014","true","20.8"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","29","34","5","0"

It's not quite that far out there. This is, first and foremost, a tactical strategy game.\n\nYour troops are deployed (at specific positions of your choice in the landing area) in a hexagonal grid representing the battlefield, and you move them around in a turn based manner. The presentation is very clean and static, with no real detailing on terrain or anything. This isn't necessarily a good thing, but I managed to look past it eventually.\n\nThere are various classes of human tank, each fulfilling different roles on the battlefield. From reconnaissance scouts to suicide bombers to artillery installations to the run of the mill tank.\nEach of these types can be improved with resources won from battles, allowing you to construct direct upgrades to the original types (usually slightly more expensively than the older one).\nThere is plenty to unlock, and some of the unlocks even have story tied to them when you manage to get there, but getting everything can be quite the grind.\n\nThe story takes place in an alternate-history Japan, where two factions are fighting for control of the land. You are a lieutenant in charge of a recently reinstated branch of the imperial army, and manage your human tanks with the help of your trusted mechanic and a newly assigned advisor / observer sent by high command (both also anime girls, because of course they are). The story takes some twists and turns and was a lot more interesting and entertaining than I expected, basic anime clichés aside, and I was happy with how it was brought to its conclusion.\n\nI got one of, I think, four possible endings and the player is free to start over after they've reached an ending and take their army as-is into a new game. Between missions you are also able to replay any previously cleared mission (and a variety of side missions), which I feel is a nice touch.\n\nI would recommend this game to players looking for a decently long, very Japanese strategy game with a solid focus on story and replayability.\nThere is a sequel out as well, I have not yet had a chance to try it but this first instalment forms a complete, stand alone story.","September 28, 2015","true","6.8"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","23","24","2","0"

It features a set of colorful character archetypes (the strict Satou, the easygoing Choko, a shut-in genius, and a bunch of awesome 'Human Tanks'. After playing for over 30 hours, here's what I think..\n\nPros:\n\n- upbeat soundtrack\n- large unit strategic variation\n- challenging bonus maps\n- multiple routes\n- easy to learn\n- great character design\n\nCons (sort of):\n\n- the campaign was too easy (common in a lot of games that emphasize difficulty in bonus content)\n- the tutorial was a bit lacking\n- there's a fair bit of farming involved (as with most Japanese games)\n- there is no way to significantly speed up large actions (you can cut out animation but it still takes a while to do hit confirmation for a large target area radius attack)\n\n**The game has a lot of dialogue in it. If you are solely interested in the tactical combat, there are several skip features implemented to aid in this.\n\nOverall, the game was really enjoyable. It would have done just fine with a little less farming but that's not much of an issue. The campaign does not take long to complete in case you are interested in the story behind it all. I am definitely interested in playing the other titles in this series once they get on Steam!\n\nOh and for those of you who like achievements..\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217602410","January 19, 2014","true","31.6"," 56 of 81 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","56","81","0","2"

Battles are fought in real-time, but with a sort of turn-based system that runs on ticks, for example after giving a unit orders to move you must then wait for it to radio in asking for new orders before it can be moved again. Battlefields are presented as a grid of octagons, and before the round commences you must first place your units as in Battleships. Each unit has it's own special properties and characteristics similar to chess, for example some may move 2 spaces at a time whereas others may only move 1, or one unit might only be able to attack horizontally whereas others must attack at least 2 spaces ahead of itself. The aim of each battle is to eliminate the opponent's 'Command Tank' before they destroy yours which, regardless of how many units they have remaining, wins you the battle. The battlefield is covered by a shroud as seen in most real-time strategies with sight range varying between your different units, so early game tactics may usually consist of Battleships-esque artillery strikes into the dark hoping you'll hit something, as your units gradually advance closer to the enemy, thinning out their ranks until their command tank is within firing range.\n\nVery nice little strategy game, with several challenging achievements to really push your tactical prowess. (You don't know pain until you've watched your entire platoon get demolished by a cat)\n\nI also throughly recommend purchasing the unbelievably extensive soundtrack, 91 tracks with a runtime of exactly 3:32:23. Three and a half hours of various funk, electronica, pop, rock and other genre-bending music that's really worth a listen if you're a true connoisseur of music.\n\nGreat game, I personally managed to lose 73 hours to it and I've already pre-purchased the upcoming sequel, ALTeR.\n\nDefinitely recommended if you like strategy games and/or visual novels and/or lolis.","December 3, 2014","true","73.6"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","28","34","3","0"

Yeah!\n\nBasically, a full scale war breaks out in Japon between the Imperial Army of the Empire and the Royal Army of the Kingdom. The primary weapons of war are artificially created beings called Human Tanks who are designed for the sole purpose of dying and combat. They are treated as weapons and have no humane rights whatsoever. You play as the laid back general of the Empire, Shoutaro Daihon'ei, as you push the overwhelming Royal Army away and strike back.\n\nThe game flows and plays very similar to the Super Robot Taisen series and most of the Strategic RPGs (SRPG) out there including Fire Emblem, Advance Wars and FFTactics. That is, you start with the story full of dialogues then you get into gameplay then the aftermath with more dialogues then finally an intermission; rinse and repeat. Unlike such Strategic RPGs however, its gameplay is in Real-Time. You can only move your tanks if you have established a connection with them or when "Connect" shows up. This means that you'll need to be on high alert AT ALL TIMES, making the game feel intense than other SRPGs. The game does tell you what you can do in the game and what to do, but certain crucial tips such as modules don't happen until slightly later so I highly recommend doing trial and error as you play. Futher, almost every tank dies in one hit; The only tanks that take a few hits are the "big ones" that take up more than one square; much like battleship. The object of the game is to either take out the enemy's command tanks, much like the king in chess, or achieve dominace on the battlefield, forcing them to retreat.\n\nDuring Intermission, you may develop stronger tanks, purchase new ones, or enter a free battle on maps you've fought on. Playing through free battles for funding or crates is somewhat a grindfest and the enemy does little to change its tatics. However, I encourage you to play the free battles a lot it allows you to try many combinations of tanks that you should've used, experiment with new tanks, and find the most effective tactics that nets you a strong victory without casualties. It feels very rewarding when farming enough crates to start building tanks that are equipped with ridiculously powerful weapons enough to annihilate half of the playfield or tanks with a beacon that allows satellite cannons to fire and wipe out everything in its sight. Try not to point these to your allies though!\n\nThe graphics in this game are between decent to quite good, depending on people's tastes. Nevertheless, its charm is undeniable. However, there is a heavy lack of diversity between tank models. Asahi and Tsubasa for example have identical appearance but one hits a single square while the other does a twin rifle salvo hitting 1 square further around. Tanks that have large equipments on their backs are an exception. It would be slightly better if they were given different hair color or accessories.\n\nThe music in this game are mostly techno, funk, rock, and hip-hop. However, they are very catchy and fit incredibly well in every situation in the game; The custom theme heard while deploying your tanks sums up the overall themes and oddities of the Human Tanks in general. Unique to this game from other SRPGs and even most visual novels is the anime openings and endings between each chapter in the story or episode. Not many may like these videos however due to its seemingly bland vocals and animation. I feel that its presentation is intentional however and the vocals reminds me of the vocals of most anime openings and jpop of the mid 80's to the early 90's which I am quite fond of.\n\nWar on the Human Tanks is a simple yet addictive game but first impressions on the game and its overall presentation depends on people's niche and taste.  That aside, I dare you to beat the first map in free battle with just Heshiko or only shock tanks!\n\nWhat else? Oh yeah! When playing this game, beware the Cat!","October 5, 2014","true","34.0"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

I know there are plenty of people of love it, but it's not my cup of tea. Aside from the long cut-scenes, the combat is really minimal and lacks depth. It's basically first-hit, first-killed. This places a huge advantage to the recon class who can reveal enemy troops on the board. Once revealed, you can easily shoot and kill them using your assault tanks or the barrage tanks. Near the end of a match it can turn into a hunt and peck game as you try to locate the one remaining enemy tank. You can level up your tanks using surplus rewarded at the end of a match.

I looked at this game and thought to myself "Hot damn... this is cute as all hell." and that is all I thought it was going to be. Now with that out of the way let me get down to brass tacks. War of the Human Tanks is a fun strategy game that is easy to pick up, but hard to put down. The game has an easy to learn control scheme and despite its tutorial being pretty bad; the game is very easy to learn.\n\nThe game has a story much resembling many other strategy games. *Don't worry. There are no spoilers here!!* You are an elite commander that has been thrown into the field as a last ditch effort to save the damned war. The difference is how funny you are! Our great commander is a man who enjoys anime, video games, and can't cook for his life. *Sound like anyone familiar?* The story is broken into episodes and plays out well. There is a serious story but with so many lighthearted moments you will be grinning to yourself.\n\nNow the game has a nice art style *Can someone say cute as hell?* It is clean and in battle animations are smooth. A little cut scene when attacking is really the only moving part of this game. The story is told with vectorized picture backgrounds and facial expression changing characters on screen. There is also dialogue... A LOT OF DIALOUGE. Though it is done well and if you really don't care about the story *shame on you* there is an ability to skip to the next battle.\n\nUpgrades are administered in between battles and honestly do affect unit performance... I was honestly surprised. You can also fight past battles in the 'Free Battle' option. This allows to you to scrape up some credits before moving onto the next episode.\n\nThe soundtrack fits in very well and is honestly catchy. I normally play my own music while playing games but this is a major exception. I honestly wouldn't mind buying a few for my collection of game soundtracks.\n\nTL;DR: War of the Human Tanks is a fun, easy to play, addicting, game that is entirely worth it's *cheap* price. You don't even have to be a big strategy fan to enjoy this game. The only reason I can see someone not liking this game is if they hate anything cute, fun, or strategy games. So if you like anime, and games or are just looking for a fun game to sink your teeth into for a low price this is the game.\n\nOverall score: 9.9/10\n-Could use some more moving animation.\n\nEdit: There are two more coming out.

The voice acting is in Japanese and the music and aesthetics provide a nice anime-feel with the cute, cartoonish character models and backgrounds.\n\nThe learning curve is fairly marginal for this game, as the tutorial helps you understand the fundamentals of the game very quickly. It is important to remember that every unit dies with one hit from any other unit (think Battleship, and all your ships cover only one grid point).\n\nDuring the preloadout screen, you can deploy your troops in the allotted grid space. To field troops, you have to pay credits (at a very reasonable price compared to your post-battle loot, which means grinding is very balanced) to train them. In order to unlock the next tier of troops, you must research them, and they will be available to train after the next battle. There are also modules, which are either persistent or one-use equipments, and you can also research new modules and build them in the pre-battle setup. Some examples are permanent modules that allow your equipped character to move +1 extra grid space or have +1 improved range for their attack, and and example of a one-use module is a long-range scanner that reveals a large chunk of the grid map (also with a vast range).\n\nThe troops you can deploy include a commander/general unit (killing these units end the game in victory or defeat, so fielding more may be beneficial) that also provides a "connection" mechanic to every human tank. A general's connection speed determines how fast or slow it will take for your units to be "connected," which makes them active and allows you to issue commands to them.\n\nThere is a shock trooper unit that self-destructs to do damage to all grid points directly above, below, and to the right/left.\n\nA recon unit can scan an area, revealing any enemy troops on those particular grid points. You reveal grid points on the map by scanning with the recon (other units can recon, but at significantly less efficiency [ex: artillery can only reveal 1 grid point, at a very short distance]). Your units also reveal a small radius around them, so moving them will provide holes in the fog of war.\n\nThere are general soldiers that will be the stormtroopers of your army, advancing rapidly and attacking at a short-medium distance.\n\nArtillery provide long range support and are very useful when synchronized with careful recon scouting.\n\nAs you research and unlock higher tiers of each unit, you will notice numerous things improving like total movement points, attack range, and ability range.\n\nYou have the option of replaying free battles or continuing with the main story. Grinding is very quick and easy in this game.\n\nThe game has a lot of charm and humor, and it does a great job and making you feel like you are in an anime. In between battles, there is even a short intro/theme song sequence that is pretty funny. There are also those ad-style pictures that come before and after commercials in an actual anime. The voice acting is very anime-style, and characters will express themselves when they attack or die.\n\nIf you are a fan of grid-based strategy and/or like anime, then you should definitely give this game a try.\n\nRecommend!","July 12, 2014","true","2.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The devs took a disturbing, morbid concept and turned it into something downright silly.  The writing isn't going to win any awards, but it's entertaining enough for a budget title.  Similarly, the strategy part is hardly the deepest game around, but it's deep enough to be fun and even a little addicting (as long as you don't grind enough to become overpowered, which isn't that hard to do).  And I quite like the novel idea of having the story branch not according to deliberate choices made by the player, but according to whether certain key battles are won or lost.  It doesn't exactly have mainstream appeal, but if it piqued your interest and all the chibi hasn't driven you away yet, you probably won't regret buying it.","May 9","true","38.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I whole-heartedly recommend buying this game, even if you dislike the art style.\n\nThe Pros:\n- Lots of tanks and modules to toy with, making for lots of customizability.  You can tailor your troop to your specific play style\n- Replayability.  Two different routes and four endings.\n- Story.  Very light-hearted but also very serious at times.  Fleshed out characters and antagonists.\n- The story missions are very nicely scaled in difficulty.\n- A modifiable transmission stat that lets the player know how soon a tank's turn is, resulting in a very malleable turn-order.\n- Simple, easy-to-learn grid-based battle system.\n- Multiple tank types that each do specific things and have specific jobs, giving the feeling of a chess board when it comes to strategy.\n- Battleship-esque combat.  One-hit destructions.  Larger tanks require more shots due to taking up more space on the board.\n- Every stat and module, (for both your tanks and enemy tanks), is viewable on the battlefield, allowing for on-the-fly changes to strategy.\n- Many bonus battles and the ability to reply previous missions at virtually anytime.\n- Decent AI\n\n\nThe Cons:\n- Art style. "Chibi" characters that may not be your thing.\n- Decent AI.  The AI has trouble guessing where the player is and using Line of Sight.\n- Evasion.  Some modules allow a tank to dodge attacks.  This is chance-based and there is no counter.\n- Grind.  If you want to get all four endings, you have to play the game four times and lose specific battles.  If you want to beat all the free battles, you will also need to grind a bit in order to be competitive with the heightened difficulty.\n- Supply system.  It is never really explained how much enemy tanks are worth to kill and certain battles seem to give disappointing rewards while others give oddly high rewards.","March 19, 2015","true","20.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

While not exactly turn based it's also not as hectic as RTS can be. Each unit is on a transmission speed, the higher the transmission speed, the faster you can make each move with it,\n\nNow I love humor just as much as the next guy and this game has that quirky humor in every cutscene and theres no voice overs so you don't have to worry about bad voice acting. The only sounds you will hear is in the tranisitions and when you use units to fire or when they're destroyed.\n\nI got the hang of this game fully but the 4th level simply because it doesn't overwelm you with infomation. In the first tutorial level it tells you the basics and thats it, after that it explains each unit including new ones that you use and the ones you face. Just be careful not to shoot your own units. (Although it's hilarious when the Enemy AI does it)\n\nEach unit is unique and well balanced. You've got Assault, Shock (Self destructing or Melee), Artillery, Scouts and Interceptors. My personal favourite is the interceptor when it's fully researched and with +3's on both range and area coverage, never worry about artillery with one of those babies. It's really rewarding to research and if you're in need of some extra supplies, simply grind out some free battles and you're set.\n\nAnother feature is the line of sights, very similar to the Fog of War from Advance Wars. If you scout an area, that area will be seen until your scout that you used can be used again so you can watch for incoming enemy tanks. Giving your scout that extra range and area coverage though modules can really help. Hell, if you have good enough units you'll never need to hit the max capacity for tanks on any given level.\n\nMy only downside that I've found is the campain. It's only 13 missions long (Excluding the few side ones and the free battles) but still tells a moving story within that time. It doesn't feel too rushed considering you're gonna be doing some grinding before some of them. You get the chance to go back and redo the campain which is not that bad when your units carry on as does your research. So it gives you plenty of time to obtain everything, plus it becomes easier with each pass of the campain rather then the opposite. (Be warned, the 13th mission is nightmare fuel, it gave me a jump when I first saw this thing)\n\nFinal score leaves me with a 9.5/10\n\nAlso, ♥♥♥♥ Mr. Cat. Just ♥♥♥♥ that thing. You're gonna need some serious grinding if you want to 100% that ♥♥♥♥.","February 2, 2015","true","29.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Unfortunately, I just couldn't get into it enough that I would recommend it to anyone.\n\nThe main issue is that you spend more time clicking though dialogue than fighting, and where that may work for Mass Effect and similar games, this one has nowhere near a strong enough storyline to support that. I felt like I was trapped in a bad anime- everything was over-cliched (seemingly on purpose- I hope), and there was no interaction or input from the player at all. This is coming from someone who likes both anime and anime-based games, as well. I feel like some sort of dialogue options, main character customization, or ability to make decisions regarding the story might have done a lot to make me feel at least slightly invested, but as it was I felt like a passenger just along for the ride, and lost interest quickly.\n\nI also feel the story is too silly and over the top to try to throw in existential questions about the humanity of your human tanks, or to make you try to feel bad for seeing them die in combat- it just ended up feeling so out of place, like they were trying to tell two different stories at the same time. Which is overall sad, because I think those things if better executed or embedded in a less silly story would have been great hooks for a player's interest.\n\nThe combat is okay, but it's not deep or complex enough to save you from the story. Directing your units in combat felt clunky in some way I can't quite put my finger on, but probably would have become familiar enough over time to not be a concern, had I been engaged enough to continue playing.\n\nIn short, I don't remember how much I paid for this game, but unless it was under 2$, I feel it was too much.","May 12, 2014","false","1.3"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

You are a commander of an army in the totally not Japan country called Japon, where they use Amasson to carry parts around.\n\nThe gameplay is simply complicated. In that I mean that it's simple that you can either send your units to attack a spot, move them, get them to reveal some map space, or do nothing. However, as simple as that looks there are a lot of factors. Different tanks excel in different areas.\nThe main types are "Commander", of which you need a minimum one, and if you lose all of you lose.\n"Shock", which can be divided, but generally hit an area around them, but also blowing themselves up in the process.\n"Recon", which can reveal large areas of map, move far but are generally bad at combat.\n"Assault" which usually are destructive, but otherwise all around.\nAnd "Artillery" which have insane range, at the cost of low mobility and speed.\n\nNow, at the start of a round you can use any mix of tanks you've made, all of which are made to be human-like, but usually without questioning orders. As you do missions, you get resources to make more. However, if a tank dies, it's permanently dead, excluding your default tank Hishiko, as well as a few select specialty tanks (Which is an important part of the plot. Unless you're Mr. Cat. Then it's just the embodiment of evil). So managing your tanks in a way to prevent them from going down as much as possible pays off. (Ie. Better strategy always pays off more than trying to brute force things with kamikazes.)\n\nThe game itself isn't too hard, as long as you take the time to plan things out. In fact, it seems most people beat the story without a loss 99% of the time on their first playthrough. However, there are more stories to be told based on how you do missions (If you fail certain ones, specifically), so it's worth a second playthrough to find these. The characters are also very interesting, as they make you question your character's motives. Is he a good guy? Or is he right in his name of "General From Hell"?\n\nA lack of multiplayer is a let down, especially in a game like this. Granted, it could obviously tip the scales towards a player who has more time in the game, but all the same they could have had a type of draft you could do, or had ___ resources to use to make your army.\n\n\nIn summary, it's a great strategy game with a great story. A lack of multiplayer is a let down, but it's easily overlooked.","January 12, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even though I am pretty uninteresting except for being very good at anime, games and being lazy, my ability to be serious for a few minutes and not act careless to my soldiers has made me the perfect anime protagonist for every girl I come across to either want me or to pretend not to want me.\n\nMy side kicks are Chiko, the cooky amazing genius who can assemble anything once someone bothers to ask her, Satou, the stereotypical mother who fusses over the protagonist while also wanting to chow down on his joystick and Heshiko, the comedic foil to everyone elses comedic antics.\n\nThe game becomes a game of hide and seek where the first people to find the other gets the kill. It's turned based, but also works in real time, so you wander out and hang about for a few minutes while people walk up to you and shoot you in the face. If you're lucky, the person next to you may decide to shoot them first, or they may just watch you die in an explosion with joy.\n\nBasically, stick your Command Tank in the back of the field, and then begin a thorough carpet bombing of the area with your insanely overpowered tanks. If you're not quite over-powered enough, you can grind, but honestly, the game throws resources at you that you'll not fall behind the power curve. Occasionally, the game will mix it up, but eventually you'll discover that nothing is as good as area of effect attacks, since they have all the benefits of a single shot but all the benefits of levelling a quarter of the stage in a single shot, killing everything that you may or may not have known is there.\n\nYou have suicide units... in a game which limits how many tanks you can take. A one-use unit, or a tank which can flatten a street is your choice. I think I may have the suicide unit twice in the game. As they ran up the enemy, they were shot. Huh.\n\nIt's a pretty fun game, you can run it in a window and listen to a podcast (I like to think this was the equivalent of me in the game basically saying "Time to win this war... Satou, have the entire army bomb the crap out of the enemy. I'll be here fiddling with my iPod and listening to Queen. Let me know if something happens). This is not a bad side; it's engaging enough and quick enough that you can fit it in between sessions or a lunch break or during a Skype conversation where the Internet keeps breaking.\n\nAs for the story, well, there is a Royal Army and an Imperial Army in a land of Japon, not Japan, Japon. The two armies are effectively indistinguishable, you fight them because... well, they're on the other side of the battlefield and that's the point of the game. There seems to be some kind of underlying conversation about whether or not a Human Tank is actually worth treating well, but it's hard to tell a deep conversation while you're also have a little power fantasy and then your Command Tank walks in and it's funny because she is stupid or something.\n\nOh, the whole Human Tanks thing? Basically, tanks don't work anymore, so they decided to make anime girls fight each other with weapons and call them tanks, a slight lobotomy to reduce initiative and then a tendency to explode if someone looks at them; later you can get tanks that require to be hit in four places to die, and as long as you bomb the enemy first, most of them should make it through.\n\nIt's a nice little game, and I had fun, and that's enough. I'd say £5 or whatever heathen money you use is definitely worth getting it. It has a New Game Plus and alternative endings, but the gameplay isn't THAT good and neither is the story. But it is solid and the anime is nice, and it doesn't have any bloody panty-shots, so it's the good kind of anime, not the kind that governments seem to be trying to outlaw recently.","December 18, 2014","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I wasn't expecting much, but War of the Human Tanks absolutely hurdled the low bar I set. Then it started doing backflips over the bar, while thumbing its nose at me for not believing. Then a Samurai Tank beat me to death with the bar.\n\nThe strategy is deep enough to be enjoyable while being light enough that it never feels overwhelming. It resembles Advance Wars in terms of strategic depth, although not in actual gameplay--it resembles the ATB systems in certain RPGs, where a bar fills in real time for each unit, with the unit able to take its turn when the bar reaches maximum. Killing enemy tanks and winning victories gets you supplies, which you use to build Human Tanks to send into the meat grinder. Using your tanks and spending supplies lets you develop new tanks, as well as equipping your better tanks with stat-boosting modules.\n\nThe story is pretty engaging, although it took a while for me to warm up to it. The writing seemed a bit stiff at first, even a bit hackneyed, but it came into its own later--its clear the writer was playing with certain anime cliches, though whether it can be called a parody is up for debate. Its not Shakespeare, but it is amusing in places and unsettlingly dark in others. I'm really psyched for the sequel.\n\nIf you are considering buying the game, definitely grab the version that comes with the soundtrack. Even after everything I just wrote, the soundtrack is probably the best part of the game.

After an hour or so, I just had to buy the full version. The story and characters are very likable, which is a good thing because there's a lot of dialogue to read. The battles aren't highly technical so far but you have to do a lot of thinking on your feet as your units only act when you command them to, and the battles don't stop for commands either. (similar to the ATB system from old final fantasy games) There's a similarity to battleship in that neither you or your opponent can see each other's units. Attacking gives away your position, of course, so you have to scout and plan very carefully. Winning battles gives you crates based on how well you did, which are then used to either create new units or upgrade existing ones.\n\nGive the demo a shot. The story was definitely what won me over at first, but the battle system is very fun as well. It isn't a very graphically advanced game, but it's fun to play.

This game was far more enjoyable then I was expecting it to be.  The music is pretty enjoyable with tons of variation. The story was interesting with a good cast of characters driving it.  I still need to finish the other endings but would recommend this game to anyone wanting something tactical that you can complete all the story sections in what I’d estimate what would be about 30 hours.  The game has some extra elements that would probably largely extend your playtime if you get into it.\n\nThe game play is somewhat like battleship.  Attacks will always hit (one exception) and when your tank has been hit it dies.  Larger tanks however require hitting all of their segments before they die.  You move your tanks and the enemy moves their tanks every few seconds.  The faster you utilize your tanks the sooner you can have them perform an action again (kind of like Chrono Trigger’s active system) there’s no turn order which gives a little bit of urgency to the game.\nThe game has a demo up on steam go try it out and if you like the combat I would recommend picking up the full game.\n","August 28, 2015","true","19.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But after the third mission it starts to increase in difficulty (albeit slowly) so be sure to research new units and equip power-ups to your tanks.\n\nThere are three main methods of attack: fast close-quarters "kamikaze" units, medium speed short-range assault, and slow but long-ranged artillery (Personally, I feel that attacking with the kamikaze tanks is basically trolling the enemy, so I only do that for sh*ts and giggles).\nScouts and anti-artillery units add depth to the gameplay due to their early warning and defensive capabilities, respectively.","July 14, 2014","true","18.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you do get stucked in some part or just want to have easier final battles you can repeat some battles to gain extra supplies, as I said, this is not needed if you use your supplies properly and do good in your battles.\n\nThere are several different units, all of them belonging to 6 different classes: Command, Assault, Barrage/Battery, Shock, Scout and Interceptor with some extra surprices here and there. You might find Barrage and Scout units really useful at first and eventually drop them, you always need 1 Command tank in battle, and if it gets destroyed you will lose, Shock tanks are suicidal and if you upgrade them can destroy pretty much everything in the map (including you), you can only use a certain amount of tanks per mission, but you choose which ones you bring so that makes the battle really interesting.\n\nOn top of that you also have "modules" that will add some extra stats or features to your tanks, they are also really expensive but there are a couple that are really cheap and can make your life easier by a lot, once a tank dies, it's gone for good, but you get some supplies from the salvage.\n\nOnce you finish the game story you unlock some extra stages that are even harder than the final fight, so once you finish the story this is something you can do (and get all endings as well).\n\nThe game is really interesting, it has some hard to get achievements and some of them may require you to make a new game, of course, you don't need to complete the game 100%, but is something that is not that hard to get once you have the experience in the game.\n\nI really don't know why I bought this game, but I really enjoyed it, a good game but keep in mind, highly story driven (unless you totally ignore it, that's possible as well), there are also another 2 sequels here on Steam if you want more Human Tanks fun :P","May 7","true","26.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It does have a hybrid feeling of Chess and Battleship which adds a sort of nostalgic feeling to it,  I recommend this game to people who would like a good strategy game and would enjoy themselves with the humerous scenarios that take place both in and out of combat.  In some aspects it may or may not be for everyone as some people who would hae a different taste in games.  The long scenarios/cutscenes before battle may make a person skip or stay and get a few laughs out of it.\n\nThe idea of being able to assemble, outfit, and place units prior to the battle's start is quite a unique feature.  With a nice view of the map, players can plcae certain units that specialize in certain areas of the map.  Also each unit has its own particular role in combat if used properly, a player can easily dominate the enemy with little time and units.  The battle music can add a nostaligc feeling when commanding your units. Although certain levels, the music varies in terms of being "Cornered, Balanced, and Dominant."\n\nThere are a few concerns though for this game such as, having an update that would allow the steam client to function properly in the game i.e the steam overlay.  Future updates or DLC that could include new units, maps, additional story, and even maybe multiplayer.  Overall I think this game is very amazing and once more I recommend this "Moe military mayhem" game.","February 8, 2014","true","59.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","4"

Apparently, the art style just needed some getting used to, because once I got into it, I thought the graphics were actually pretty good. There's full voice acting, fun animations and even some really catchy music that makes me itch to buy the soundtrack.\nBut what about the meat of the game? That, for me, comes in two packages (or perhaps Amasson boxes): the story and the gameplay. Let's get this out of the way: The story is awesome. I loved it. This is definitely not a "skip-the-dialogue" kind of game; in fact, after a certain point, the story became the main appeal. It's simultaneously lighthearted and grim, with a really interesting setting that ends up being much more detailed than you might suspect at first. There are four endings (two main paths, with two endings each) that all end up being pretty radically different and are all fantastic in their own way. I'm really in love with the setting, and all the little things you can learn about the rather disenfranchised battle-androids they call Human Tanks; the story really exceeded my expectations in every way. The translation is great, and the writing is clever, funny and serious when it needs to be; some of the big twists were huge gut-punchers. I'd definitely say the story was maybe the best part for me, and it'll stick with me and inspire me for other personal projects for quite a while.\nFinally, the gameplay itself: it's great. My first playthrough was fantastic. The active-time battles with a heavy focus on recon and fog of war really keep things interesting, and even after you've played a battle a bunch of times you might still find yourself having trouble. There are plenty of different unit types that can switch up the way you play (though I tended to shy away from the poor Shock tanks because they just break my heart when they yell "I DON'T WANT TO DIE!" before exploding) and the long and rewarding research lines kept me grinding away at the free battles for a long time. Even the grinding was fun, though! I found myself enjoying the battles no matter how many times I played them, even when I got them down to a science. The AI is fairly challenging, and even with heavily-upgraded units, the later battles can really surprise you with how they masterfully crank up the difficulty. Naturally, the New Game Plus makes you feel a bit overpowered, and once you get to the highest levels of tech, your units are laughably broken, but that's kind of part of the appeal, and at a certain point I was just using the beefed-up units to fly through battles and get to all the endings anyway, since the story was really compelling. There are incredibly, incredibly challenging extra free battles, and you can play any of the myriad different story missions any time you like. I think my only complaint with the battle system was the 'evade' mechanic; it's basically just a random chance that, for no real reason, your attack just didn't work. It was pretty frustrating having sound strategy and fully-upgraded units but still missing because of a roll of the dice, and the evade mechanic never seemed to do me any favors either, but maybe I was just unlucky with the RNG. Either way, seeing as I put 35 hours into the game over just a couple of days, it clearly didn't dampen my enthusiasm that much.\nAfter all that, my opinion is pretty clear; as of now, this is the only game I've bothered writing a review for, and it's because I loved the gosh-darn heck out of it. The story is fantastic, the gameplay is both super unique and endlessly engaging, and even if it looks a little low-budget at first, the entire game is surprisingly polished and clearly has a lot of heart behind it. I'd heartily recommend this to anyone who's a fan of military strategy, Fire Emblem-type games with a compelling narrative. Please, give it a spin-- and for god's sake, be nice to Heshiko!","February 18, 2014","true","53.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The characters aren't exactly novel quality, but they're quirky, amusing, and likable which makes them interesting in their own right and the game itself is simple and easy to understand but requires you to play well if you actually want to win. It doesn't have a ridiculous list of mechanics and gameplay bells and whistles, but the simplicity of the system doesn't make the game boring. Honestly I much prefer games that focus on simple gameplay and making that gameplay immersive over games that require tons of mechanics just to make up for the fact that the game itself is generic and boring throughout.\n\nIn short, it's not a "AAA title" but it's an actually enjoyable game that's worth it's price tag if you like quirkiness and simple gaming.","January 15, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

It's a bit overpriced, in my opinion. On the Steam store it's $10 but if your able to pick it up for a $1 either from other sites or on a Steam sale it's worth a play or two.\n\nIt's a bit long winded with it's dialogue and really didn't care for the cut scenes. I couldn't get in to that but maybe some people will enjoy it, as for my experience it was a bit odd to say the least. The art and battle animations are a bit different when you think of strategy games but I guess that it's suppose to have an Anime appeal. The actual gameplay though is some what satisfying. It's a very simplified grid based game but instead of turn based, each unit has a timer for when they'll be able to make a move. Which is a bit different from most grid based games.\n\nOther then that, it's pretty straight foward pick between recon, assault, shock, battery  and command tanks to make up your army of human tanks. There's a fog of war which keeps thing interesting. There is no terrain modifiers, which was surprising for a grid based strategy game. The thing that I thought was most interesting was that you can upgrade your tanks with "modifiers" which give them certain augments in battle and also the fact that when your units are killed they don't come back. You have to replace them with parts which can only be gained in battles won, so you'd want to keep your human tanks alive. At least in the main campaign which progressing through so far, is similar to an RPG to an extend.\n\nI like that they have a customizable deck that you change, RPG element and the abilty to lose units in battle as the campaign progresses. It would have been nice to see it more polished but for what it is, it's an alright game. If your looking for more a of a traditonal strategy games I'd suggest Unity of command instead. This is really a niche game and would suggest only pick it up if you really like Anime quirkness.

There is nothing even vaguely resembling strategy, you just randomly fire at hexes and hope that something's there. If you have more than 1 unit you can recon as well, which is also just randomly clicking on hexes and hoping something's there.\n\nThe "tutorials" consist of a single page of instructions which you have to memorize before playing each scenario.\n\nThen there are the cut scenes. Honestly, I think I might have gotten something out of this game if it weren't for these. They appear to be unskippable and are insanely annoying. They're done as JRPG style dialogues, where you have to click everytime someone talks. Even clicking through as fast as I could without reading anything I still spent more time clicking through cut scenes that I did playing the "game."\n\nThere maybe a good game under all the god awful dialogue, but since that takes up 90% of the time spent it's impossible to tell.","June 26, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

At least, if you're the type that plays large numbers of games like myself. War of the Human Tanks entered my library at a time when I was also playing another Japanese tactical game, Fire Emblem: Awakening. Thus it's rather natural that there would be a comparison.\nBut I find it kind to warn prospective players: Many will compare this to Fire Emblem or Battleship, but it's definitely NOT. Honestly, while it IS a strategy game, it's actually a pseudo-real time strategy, not a turn based game. This caught me off guard at first, so I feel it's fair to warn people.\nNow, for those experienced with these types of games, it follows the pretty typical formula: You're in charge of an army, and your job is to accomplish objectives and not lose your command tank(s) before the match ends. The first matches are actually quite challenging as you get used to the systems, but once you start being able to field certain units, the game can become laughably easy. Don't get me wrong, the challenge is still there, especially if you're averse to grinding missions, but if you like the challenge you'll probably find yourself cranking up the difficulty and/or springing for the bonus maps.\nSo if you like Japanese style indie games with a sense of humor and don't mind sending cute little tank-girls to their deaths (seriously, there's a unit whose specific existence is to suicide bomb the enemy. It's the cheapest unit, and screams that it doesn't want to die as it explodes.) this is the game for you.","February 17, 2014","true","15.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its simplistic art style compliments its simplistic gameplay, making a good game to pass time.\n\nLike all visual novels the game has mulitple endings, however, here they are dictated through your performance rather than choices. The banter between the protagonists and his corp is that of slice-of-life anime, giving this war game a relaxed feel to it. As for the music, its quite good, most if not all of the tracks fitting the mood of the situation.\n\nHowever, there are aspects of the game that gripe me. One is the level of grind that one has to do to even develop most of the tech. This is further compounded by the fact that you cannot cut out the animations to save time, so even if you are speed running to farm money, it still eats up a bit of time. Lastly, the game is a little too easy. I personally would have liked to have seen a "hard" mode that most Japanese games feature, where you get to start over against more difficult opponents.\n\nAll in all, a good game to pass time.","January 24, 2014","true","10.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game looks and feels like a nod to anime with it's catchy intro, memorable characters, and soundtrack (props to the final boss tracks, I really wish they were on the full soundtrack of the game). The only downsides that I could find is that there are way too many cutscenes that take awway from the experience, and overall the main story only thirteen level, however this is forgiven because of the multiple paths, alternate chapters/episodes, hilarious side battles, and unlockable tanks at the end that are a joy to use in battle.

It's a visual novel. and a horrible one at that. In retrospect I wouldn't even pay five dollars for this.\n\nThis game turned out to be a big dissapointment despite what I had expected of it. I thought I had bought a cute tank game with cute characters cabable of entertaining with an underlying theme of Japanese militiarism and imperialism. I love war games, especially those in which you can play from a Japanese perspective. This game is far from having any historical grasp and instead has no relevence or significance to anything. This in itself can be easily excused however since taking historical viewpoints can be taboo and perhaps lead some people to avoid a game for something more palletable to their sensibilitie. However, actual battle simulation is a complete after thought. Instead, the game is hardly even a game, consisting primarily of visual novel content. I wasn't expecting this game to be a poorly-written visual novel.\n\nThe visual novel aspects of the game are horrible. The plot is so crushingly bad and the characters flatter than those found in an Ayn Rand novel, setting aside the obvious problem of a) why the hell this has to be a visual novel and b) why muh tank game needs characters with agency to begin with. THEY'RE HUMAN TANKS. I SHOULD BE THE ♥♥♥♥ING COMMANDER AND THAT'S IT. I could express how ♥♥♥♥ing bad the vn is but experience serves best. Spare yourself by not gaining the expereince.\n\nDon't buy the game. If you do, skip all the ♥♥♥♥ing dialog. All of it. This is a trash vn with a tiny bit of user controlled combat in between sledgehammer prose and cliche, one-step-below-novice writing. If I could skip everything else I'd just play the battle sequences. In fact the entire game should be the battle sequences, WTIHOUT the destitute attemmpts at plot and characters. And without renaming Japan to Japon. And without Splitting the Empire of Japan into the Empire of Japan and Kingdom of Japan. Just u ♥♥♥♥ing wot m8.

Not since Disgaea have I had so much fun modding out my units to insane levels. Assault Tanks that can nuke half the battlefield? Scout Tanks than can recon the entire map at once? You can do all that and more in WotHT.\n\nI've sunk about 30 hours into the game so far and still haven't beaten it. I was a little hesitant to write a review early on since the game seemed rather simplistic and I was worried it would be too short or not have enough variety to last but the tank development and modding always keeps things fresh and if you like buffing your units up until they're crazy powerful, you'll get plenty out of this game. It may not be as pretty or complex as games like Disgaea or Advance Wars but it's still good in it's own right.\n\nI do have some minor quibbles, though. 1) The UI is very unintuitive. I could make a long list of minor tweaks that would make it very much improved but after playing for a couple hours you get used to it. 2) The game is pretty easy. Part of this is due to the fact that you can develop your tanks at your own pace, regardless of the story progression but even then, they could have made the missions more difficult expecting you to develop strong tanks. 3) The game is a little grindy. If you want to keep up on tank development you tend to go through a cycle of: beat a new mission, replay that mission 3 more times to stack extra supplies, proceed to the next missions, beat the new mission, replay that mission 3 more times to stack extra supplies, repeat. It's not terrible since, like I said, the missions aren't that difficult but I feel something could have been done to make replaying missions a little more interesting.\n\nOverall it's a fantastic game, though. I highly recommend it if you have any interest in strategy games like Disgaea or Advance Wars.","March 31, 2014","true","47.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's challenging, but you can save the game before each battle so, if you wish to, you can reload your save and try again as many times as you want. You can't save mid-battle though, so there's a limit to how much you can exploit your saves.\n\nThe story will at first feel silly and perhaps even a little dumb, but if you pay attention you'll pick up on some surprisingly dark and even thought provoking undertones.\n\nIt is certainly a strange game, but so far I have no major complaints.

It progresses forward by Episodes, each with their own interesting interactions between characters and lots of plot and filler alike. The game gives a few light jabs at various anime tropes, but still manages to keep itself on course with a coherent and easy-to-follow plot.\n\nThe visuals in War of the Human Tanks can be described as "simple yet pleasing". The game wasn't made to be a work of masterful art, but the chibi approach in character design gives the game an adorable feel, despite the occasionally grim approach in it's plot. The art of War of the Human Tanks fits well for what it is made for, but would most likely be considered too simplistic for other games.\n\nThe soundtrack iin the game is, at times, repetitive, but can be rather catchy. I find it nice to listen to the music, and rather enjoy the shifts in themes depending upon the scenario that the main character approaches. There isn't much to be desired, since the game itself is made in a simplistic format. I'd personally recommend leaving the sound on during gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is where War of the Human Tanks really shines. With a Battleship-style of approach, the player must use their Human Tank units to scour a battlefield board and find the opposition and their minions. With Fog of War playing a large role in the game, scouts and other techniques are needed to find out just where the enemy might be hiding. This makes the game, at times, challenging. But it makes the victories more than worth it, leading every kill on the field to be a satisfying one, and every surprise attack to be exhilerating. As the game moves on, the player can upgrade units and add accessories to them to improve performance, eventually creating your own crack "super squad" of Human Tanks. Players will find that later in the game, the accessories can give them a better edge with every upgrade, and the units get more powerful and insane weaponry. Even a cat.\n\nOverall, War of the Human Tanks is a fun game that is worth a few dollars if you have the chance to buy it. It's not a game for the serious, but a good game for casual time-killing and one that adds a good rewards system for effort. There is a decent plot with multiple endings to be achieved, and a number of mildly difficult battles to face along the way. Don't be afraid of trying it out. It's worth the effort, and the presentation of the plot will have you playing right to the end to get the most of it.\n\nAlso, keep some Cola handy. Human Tanks love it.","February 28, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead tanks in this game are just a term for...erm...female robots? That's all I can gather on what tanks are XD\n\nBeing serious now, the game itself is a fun little strategy game which concepts from (from my experience) Risk, Battleship, bit of Checkers, and a bit of Chess. Just to recap so you're not reading paragraph after paragraph of rambling, here's the good bits:\n- The game board itself relies on a mix of RTS mapstyle, Tetris, and a bit of turned base gameplay. For the RTS style everything on the map except your spawn point is hidden and won't be revealed unless if your ally gets shot by a nearby enemy or you recon the area revealing that bit for a little while (this goes same with the AI in the game, don't mistaken them shooting randomly as an AI fault, they're just as blind as you). Your units also have a timer on them in which they can CONNECT and start moving, so the board does rely on real time to get things going. Usually the heaviest armed unit moves last, and the most mobile unit moves first. This goes same with the enemy, and make sure you plan your moves carefully because if you switch out of an unused unit, it does count as your turn. As for the Tetris bit I mentioned, without spoiling anything in the game, some units take up more space than others, which restricts the number of units you can place on the battlefield. The bigger the better, but that means less tanks to spare, so plan wisely.\n- The AI is suprisingly good. More than often I find myself being shot by an unknown assailant on the map which forces me to plan more strategically and carefully. They will use their recon units to scope you out, which won't show up on your map as being spotted. Same goes with the AI, if you recon them, chances are you have the upperhand and they can't see you. AIs will use their units as they are meant to be, usually sending fast units in first to cushion up your army for their heavier units in the back.\n- Unit development, assembly, and earning money for units to develop and build is great. Every upgrade has a better trait than the last. Small complaint: I do find myself grinding a bit for better units to beat the next chapter. Losing doesn't affect you for most of the game but I'd rather keep winning ^^\n- The storyline is great. Not expecting golden novel material here since I'm just a casual gamer, but I find the dialogue to be pretty well done. It looks as if the writing was edited after translation so I appreciate the effort put into this.\n- The music is great. I'm loving the variety of songs available in this game.\n- Controls are really simple. It's mostly a point and click kinda game so you won't need to bind lots of keys to make the game work.\n- Preformance of the game is great, since this is an indie game based on board game-like mechanics it doesn't require the highest build out there to run. I would argue that this could run on any computer just fine :D\n\nJust a few bits I wanna discuss about:\n- I find the noise of gunfire and explosions to be too excessively used in the dialogue sections of the game as well as the screen shaking effect. Expect lots of shaking and loud noises when you're going through these scenes.\n- This game will deter people who just wanna play the game and enjoy the story but on a limited time. The dialogue sections themselves are worth a full chapter of a novel (if you take your time) in real time to read and understand for most of the time. Just a head warning: if you get the game, hope you like reading because there is lots of it.\n- Music can get pretty obnoxious at times especially during the cutscenes, thankfully there's a full on custom sound tool that allows you to turn it off when it needs to be off.\n- This game has an ongoing morbid humour of treating tanks (I wanna call them androids) like expendibles. If you're not into that kind of thing then you can just skip the cutscenes if you want (the game has that option).\n- The AI can be predictable since spawns are set and not randomized. If you're the type to play this game for hours on the same map, expect to see a pattern on how the AI behaves and where they spawn. No this doesn't mean they become ENTIRELY predictable, I had that mistake happen to me once on the same map on the 11th playthrough and had three of my tanks destroyed by a sniper, which never happened in the past games.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun little game to play. Looking forward to seeing what they'll add in the future (on their site they said they're planning to add more content). Have fun!","November 30, 2014","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I bought this game, I bought it for the art style and the whole “human tank” concept. Then when I played the game, I found it really engaging. The gameplay is very unique for a strategy game and the story has more depth than I expected for a game revolving around “human tanks.” When I first started playing this game, its pacing was okay. It was a little slow, but still in enjoyable. When I reached the latter stages and upgraded all of my tanks completely, the game was so fast paced it was insane. I was able to kill entire armies before they even got a chance to move! I personally really like the music for this game. Although, I can see people really despising some of the songs. So I recommend for anyone just getting into this series to just buy this game solo. Then, if you like this game and its soundtrack, buy the second game with the soundtrack bundle. Both soundtrack bundles share the same soundtrack anyway.","April 25","true","27.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
