It requires the most precise mouse movements I've ever seen in a game. So lets this be a warning to any noobs that think beating Ninja Gaiden makes you some sorta pro, this game with destroy you. I found it helps if you are using a Cathode Ray Tube monitor from 1992. The dialogue is really deep. Everytime Putt-putt asks me what game I would like to play I get chills and the relationship Putt-putt and Fatty bear share is simply heart warming. You really feel a connection to them almost like you have real friends. Careful though because it can be very addicting. If you are prone to vice, this game is like heorine compared to World of Warcraft. This game has been known to take peoples' lives away. All and all, this game makes me regret owning any other steam game because for all the time I spent playing them I could have been playing this. 1000/10. Buy this game.","January 6, 2015","true","1.3"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","92","22","24","23","1"

With him being 2,I of course,have to help him quite a lot and that being said I think this is a really cute game for the 10 and under crowd. . .\n\nThere are lots of activities to do in this game for older kids. Right now about all Elijah can do is the picture painting and he completely loves doing that. . . The older he gets,the more he will be able to play. . .\n\nI think I picked this one up for 39 cents and in my opinion I would have paid up to $3.99 for it,its well worth it.Some of the activities are checkers,painting,a memory type game,word finds and a game we call "Dots",where you have to make random lines on a grid of dots,in hopes of making boxes before your opponent does,the one with the most completed boxes by the end of the game,wins. . . And in all truth,I still play this game on paper with my 21 yr old daughter as it's a great strategy type game. . .\n\nI give this kiddie-activity game a solid 9/10 and I do recommend it. . .\nHappy Gaming Everyone. . . .","June 13, 2015","true","4.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

It's also the only other game to star Fatty Bear who only had one game as oppose to Putt-Putt who starred in several games and a few spin-offs. Anyways this game immediately starts up in a mini game menu hosted by Fatty & Putt-Putt. No intro, plot, or goal for this game the only thing to do is just play any of the given games with either Fatty or Putt-Putt as the opponents. It's sorta like a predecessor to Pajama Sam's Games to Play on Any Day. And there isn't much else to say about the content of the game. I am surprised that Humongous Entertainment never made any other cross over games on their other games. It's common for them to have various characters making cameos in each others games but never a game where they actually speak to one or another. Putt-Putt would go on to star in a few more mini game theme spin off games like this one. While Fatty Bear sadly never got a shot at being in more games. Overrall this game is worth playing for die hard Humongous Game fans.","January 6","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
