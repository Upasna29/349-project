It currently has too many pay to win features. If they focused more on charging players for cosmetics and lowered the monthly premuim membership cost then they would be making a move in the right direction. I recommend giving it a chance for a weekend and see if it's your thing or not. The game is good, but if they don't fix the pay model and remove the damage bonus for cash players then this game will never become popular or worth playing any further than commander level 5.","April 1","true","166.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I'm only 4 hours into playing but so far I don't really see any grounds for why the game has got such a bad reputation. The gameplay is solid and it left me wanting to play more. The main downside is the localisation, the game can be intimidating at first and with the wiki being in russian its fairly difficult to look up any guides. If you get past that however the game is misleadingly simple with some hit and miss skill descriptions.\n\nIn short it's a really good co-operative turn-based shooter vs. other players being explained to you by someone who can speak english....for the most part...just think of it as added challenge and it's great.","March 18","true","38.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I'll recommend it... but take it with a grain of salt, this game could be better.\n\nI don't have too many hours on record but I did enjoy the time I put into it. After the first 3-4 matches... I finally figured out that I could win nearly every match simply by outmaneuvering the enemy team and taking their flag with one soldier and bumrushing middle with my other. Most players are willing to waste action points to shoot at you while I'm using them to push in further to their territory. Most matches I never fired a single round. Which is sad... I have yet to truly enjoy a match where my positioning made a huge difference and that we were able to annihalate the other team.\n\n\nPros:\n-Free game.... it's not hurting you to not play it.\n-Actually quite tactical with some decent co-op potential\n-Great Concept and the soldiers look awesome\n-Russia\n-Smaller and Larger scale engagements\n-Command 1 - 4 soldiers at a time in cooperation with your fellow teamates\n-I've played freemium games that annoy the snot out of you to buy their premium content,,, and I feel like this one is leaving me alone to make that choice myself instead of shoving it in my face.\n\nCons:\n- You can definitely pay to win... Some may argue you can aquire that premium currency for free by playing enough but that doesn't defeat the fact that I could pay them right now and have some gear to give me a MAJOR edge from the get-go. Things like weapons, armor, enhanced healing, vision, sprint distance that can make/break a victory or defeat.\n- Unless I'm wrong... there's only CTF mode... turns into multiple flags later but still no fight to the death mode that I have found yet.\n- Matches are too quick due to the CTF mode. Every turn gains points and after one team holds the majority, the points multiply insanely quick. Making the priority to push the other player off the point and forego any other possible tactic... Simply shooting a person off a point rarely works unless you've beat them down some prior to their assault\n- Feels a bit grindy... and not enough incentive to keep doing so.\n- I could play this on my phone, and be happier with it.\n\n\nThe game honestly just makes me want to buy XCOM 2 for a turn based tactical strategy.\n","March 17","true","4.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Unless you buy premium that is really expensive. So pray u dont play against a team of premiums.\n\nBots are really dumb, they just run around away from battle doing nothing. They made the option to give them 3 simple orders but not if they are to far away ( that means close to you) so if u want to command a bot to do something u have to run after him.\nYou also have command points, but not enough to command every bots, and the more turns u get into the more expensive they cost, u can barely command 1 bot every 2 or 3 turns.\nThe best thing is that when u command a bot to guard a point u can expect the command to vanish after a few turns so u have to get back to him running away and tell him to get back to his spot hoping he doesnt get killed on the way because.\nThe best way to play is to not taking care of the bots and just use your 2 soldiers hoping u dont have premiums in front of u.\n\nThey've put the opportunity to heal your soldiers, so just run in the fight, shoot, get shot, retreat, heal for 1 turn and get back in the fight, u can do that as long as u want and u wont die.\nSounds stupid for a turn based strategy game no ?\n\nThey are a few bugs but nothing dramatical, the gameplay is getting really bad and the more u advance the more u can feel that u cant build a real strategy unless u spend a lot and a lot of money. When u see the prices u can just fall off ur chair, never seen a game that expensive.\n\nIt could be a nice multi game but now i understand why people just get fed up so quickly. It's made for people who want to wack newcomers with cash like i've red on other games.","March 23","false","11.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Until I put in the hours ive played so far this "CAN"  be a great game but theres so many problems with it that they need to fix.\n\n1) some of the classes are WAY to overpowered and others are underwhelming by far\nThe sniper class is the best ive seen when it comes to raw dmg and accuracy barely misses and does about 30-90 dmg a shot all you can do is move out of there field of vision and even that cant save you if they have ambush shot on die the moment you try to run stay and get headshot. The grandier and heavy grandier ive seen land full clean hit form halfway down the map and do just as much if not more than the sniper pretty sure a grenade lanucher cant fire 900+m down the map and "HIT EVEN IN COVER" through trees and buildings and usually breaks a few limbs on every hit. While other classes are so bad their unplayable such as: the gunner(support), heavy gunner(support) take 3 turns to setup range is okay but they can use cover and just sit out the open till they get shot to death in 1 turn, rpg lanucher(support) range/dmg is a JOKE and takes a full turn to reload and chance to hit is awful in what world does a noob tube better in every single way than a RPG(ROCKET PROPALLED GREANDE), and flamethrower(heavy inf) which isnt a flamethrower unit all same as the rpg but WORSE just shoots rocket that deal 1 dmg and then lite the gorund on fire which you think would help but nope they just walk off of it and then kill you while you WASTE your turn reloading sapper(commando) lays traps and mines ive never seen anyone play them in my 300+ games so whats that tell ya these are all WORTHLESS when it comes to dmg combat skills and over gameplay\n\n2) The pay to win is REAL in this game, now look I know when it comes to making a free to play game you've go to find some way to be able to keep you severs up and running but my GOD are the paid weapons BROKEN and you can use most of them in rank 1 games WHAT?! WHY?! all the pay to win guns in this game stats are about 120% better than the free version with certian mods placed on them that only they can have as well as armor and healing item that can "FULL" heal and the tick on then keeps you full for 4 turns and other one heals all broken limbs the free item are lacking by far when in comparsion a little blancing here would go a long way like up the price on the healing items or make the weapons only good for so many days before they run out and you need to buy them over not permeant holy crap.\n\n3) The game modes or should I say game mode as is theres only one take the points and hold kinda of a CTF/King of hill combo trust me it gets old FAST really?! no other game sytles even the most basic free to play games have more variety than this why not pvp combat or i dunno a game mode where you and 4 other units have to hold out a certain number of waves of ever increasing odds that get more and more powerful till you either win or DIE or something else ANYTHING to try and change up the game and keep it fresh i can only play maybe 1 or 2 games then im done was fun at 1st now its old\n\nAll in all this is a fun game dont get me wrong but right now its to buggy  the gameplay and mechanics need a HUGE overhual and the pay to win aspect needs to be toned down a bit but other than that you guys a fun and great game guys just need to little more work and some love and even i would spend money for this if it gets fixed up.
