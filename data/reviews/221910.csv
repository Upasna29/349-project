Here is my real review for this game:\n\nThe Stanley parable is an interesting game, but it has no jumping, no zombie killing, and no Call Of Duty references in it, but a whole lot of button pressing.\n\nThis game gives you choices, but a small number of choices. The many endings are quite few and I believe there should have been more of them.\n\nThere's really not much more I can say about this game. It does have a balanced amount of humor and it is actually good humor. Wow, a game (better yet SOMETHING in modern America) with actually good jokes. Other than that, the game is pretty fun, for about 5 hours. To be honest, it gets kind of boring after playnig it for a while.\n\n7.5/10\n\nThis game has potentional and it is of acceptable quality, but it needs more to it.

'Why what?' I hear you ask. No! Just simply 'why'. A question you will constantly ask yourself, and probably never answer well enough to feel satisfied.\n\nSo what is the game? Well you play Stanley, who works in an office. And one day Stanley realises everyone else has disappeared and it is up to him to find out why ... or is it? You see the problem with describing this game is whilst there are many different endings, none of them seem to be 'the right one', or perhaps all of them are.\n\nYes I realise this review is not even slightly helpful in undertand what this game is, and wether or not you should buy it.  So here it is: Buy this game and play it! It is something that everyone should experience. Love it or hate it .... you really should try it.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io3c1USf0V4&list=PLE7DlYarj-Dd0n0idk-siWmqIFcXCzZ48&index=2","December 30, 2014","true","4.9"," 351 of 380 people (92%) found this review helpful 61 people found this review funny","92","351","380","61","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/221910/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewThe Stanley Parable is a one of a kind game. You play as Stanley, an employee that has to press buttons. When suddenly, you stop and head out your office. A narrator describes your adventure and it's up to you to listen to him or not. Explore the office building and make different choices every playthrough and unlock all of the many endings possible!\n\nThe Pros:Beautiful - The graphics are decent, the lightning glorious, and walking through the building is pleasant to the eye.\n\nChoices - The best thing a game can do for you is let you be in control. The Stanley Parable makes you make your own story, every step of the way, and unlocking a different ending every time. Such decisions include taking the left or right door, going to the meeting or not, or turning off the evil machine... or not. Every action has a thing to say for the ending.\n\nComical - The narrator says things that are sometimes very funny, the way he reacts when you disobey him and the scenes you encounter have some very rich monologue.\n\nDeep - It might not look like this the first time you play, but as you uncover different endings you will see the hidden meaning behind Stanley's story. The writing is very cleverly done, the existance of the narrator poses further questions, and the very nature of reality bends amongst different endings.\nThe Cons:Repetitive up to a point - As the story forks at different intersections, you are bound to repeat parts of it until you reach the branching point. Some of the paths require waiting for long narrations to play, so you might become a little impatient along the process.\n\nUnconventional Achievements - Most achievements require a degree of witt to figure out what they want (or read a guide) but there are some that are really unnecessary, such as playing the game for the entire duration of a Tuesday, implying either BIOS Time Changing or leaving the PC idle for 24 hours, the Unachiveable, which requires configuration file tweaks and the Go Outside which makes you not play for... 5 years. Of course, circumventable with a little sly techniques, but they are not achievements related to the game. They don't track progress or skill, they're just there to mess with you and waste your time.\nConclusion:The Stanley Parable stand out amongst the rest of pshycological narratives and really puts the player in a position of power over his destiny, or at least gives him a very powerful delusion about it. Buy with confidence, it is an enjoyable experience.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

The writing is clever, and the narration is charming, while also managing to be just a little unsettling.  It's a game, so much in that you control movement and press buttons.  But there isn't any combat, and the freedom of choice is just an illusion (which is kinda the point).  It's meant to be played over and over again, just to see the different reactions you can get from the game.  And there are many many reactions to find.\n\nAnd if this doesn't sound like something you'd want to spend any time with, you can always treat it like a really obscure easter egg hunt.  Because there's a ton of those too.  If you are like me, and you try to break a game just for fun, you might find out that this game considers it a legitimate storytelling branch.\n\nAnd if that doesn't sell it to you either, you can consider it a narrator annoyance simulator.  It's something for everyone, provided you like these three things.","October 19, 2014","true","2.9"," 243 of 258 people (94%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","94","243","258","25","1"

Stanley works in a dead end job carrying out mindless tasks; and the story is told by one of the best narratives I have ever heard. Graphics isn't an important feature here, but that being said, it looks really nice.\n\nThe design of the world is very well done, you are essentially in an office building, but it does a very clever thing where you can sometimes be walking around in a circle, and then all of a sudden the world changes, and you are somewhere else. This made the experience feel more real to me. You can make this game as easy or as difficult as you want. There is fifteen different stories and endings to the Stanley Parable, each of them is amazingly written, probably one of, if not the best story in gaming I've experienced and well worth playing.  It has taken me almost seven hours to play through all of the endings, and do all but one of the achievements. After you have played all of the endings though, there is probably no need to go replay any of the game again.\n\nIs the game worth ¬£9, 99, sure? For about seven hours of gameplay and the amount of fun I had playing it; you cannot miss out on The Stanley Parable. This is now in my top ten favourite games of all time.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It places players in the mundane shoes of Stanley, a corporate desk jockey who is placed in an office in front of a computer where he punches buttons for a living. One day his monitor goes blank and the other corporate drones that he shares the office building with disappear and so begins your Journey as Stanley.  Being the dull chap that he is, Stanley himself doesn't offer much ion the area of entertainment, but a charming English narrator provides the personality and humor necessary to make The Stanley Parable an enjoyable experience. The narrator provides player with instructions, becoming almost like a GPS device that has confused itself for a raconteur.\n\nWhere most games are about following the rules, The Stanley Parable is best enjoyed when breaking them. If the narrator says go right, you will certainly find more satisfaction in taking a left and listening as the narrator's knickers become twisted by your wanton disobedience. By taking these divergent paths you will find yourself faced with one of the game's 15 different conclusions. Each conclusion revels something a bit different about Stanley and they range from conspiratorial to surreal. The game plays a few tricks on you by repeating rooms endlessly or swapping out props on the fly truing an office into an apartment space. All of this is rendered in a simple and clean visual style. The color palette is muted to reflect just what a dull and miserable existence our pal Stanley has and the props are equally generic creating an appropriately stodgy atmosphere. As advertised the texture work adds far more detail than could be found in the original mod and overall the HD remix has much greater visual appeal.\n\nSo is The Stanley Parable a biting satire of the way in which modern games tell their story by allowing us to control a character on a predetermined path where deviation is punished? Is it a parody of the life of the average key punching office drone? Or, is it just an excuse to have a rather cheeky British man tell us what to do? The answer is that it's all of these... and none of them. It's a game that will give each of it's players a different take away. Each playthrough lasts between 15 minutes and a half hour. This doesn't sound like a lot of playtime, and it isn't but there is a tremendous degree of satisfaction in finding new ways to get the game to react to what you are or, in some cases, are not doing. Seeing all 15 endings without consulting a guide will probably take around 3 hours. These 15 endings are not Mass Effect 3 style endings either‚Äîthey are wholly unique and there are a couple of treats for gamers to be uncovered. Ultimately, The Stanley Parable will not be everyone's cup of tea, but it holds a very special spot in the gaming landscape. It's a testament to satire and unconventional design as well as manipulating gamer's expectations. In short it's the antithesis of it's key punching dullard protagonist.","November 25, 2013","true","3.9"," 703 of 846 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","703","846","0","16"

You play as employee number 427; an employee who only pushes buttons as per the instructions of his superiors. Stanley, however, does not receive any orders one day, therefore, he gets up from his desk and starts investigating what exactly has happened.\n\nAnd this is where you take control of him in this FPS which uses the well-known game engine called Source. Our protagonist immediately notices that nobody else is present in the office - he passes empty cubicles and corridors trying to find the answers.\n\nThere are no weapons in this game. No NPCs you can interact with. No objectives. No goals. Stanley Parable is about exploration. And this exploration, this journey of our white-collar worker is accompanied by the narrator's voice.\n\nHowever, you will notice that the narrator tells Stanley, in advance, which door he is supposed to take. But you can refuse the command and go to the direction you desire. And this is the most crucial part of this game: it is about choices. Your choices.\n\nAnd these choices can yield you at least a dozen endings. Endings that are funny, serious, sarcastic and some are even meant to be no more than mere easter eggs.\n\nThis is not something you'll spend dozens of hours with. No, Stanley Parable can be completed in a mere 30 minutes, still, it's worth the journey and the appreciation.","October 25, 2014","true","27.2"," 174 of 194 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","174","194","7","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/221910/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","Narrator: "Stanley was fascinated about reading reviews. On this particular day, a new review showed up on his news feed. Stanley got excited. Without hesitation, Stanley began to read it."\n\nNarrator: "Sorry, I said, without hesitation, Stanley began to read it."\n\nNarrator: "Ahem. Without hesitation, Stanley began to read it."\n\nNarrator: "STOP IGNORING ME!"\n\nThe Stanley Parable is an odd one partly because it is, in essence, a first-person walking simulator with minimal ‚Äúgameplay‚Äù in it.  So, does it qualify as a game? Not in the traditional sense, that is certain. So what is the catch then?\n\nUnlike other walking simulators you would find around, The Stanley Parable's gimmick is its narrative-driven "gameplay", so to speak. Taking the role of Stanley Parable, you find yourself alone at your desk in the office until one day when the computer screen turns blank and all your colleagues mysteriously vanish. At this point, you begin to follow The Narrator‚Äôs voice which ‚Äúguides‚Äù you through the complex by narrating what Stanley would have done in the first place.\n\nBut this is where the game shines and, arguably, distinguishes itself from other dull walking simulators. If you remember how games nowadays (maybe even in the past) boast about how they provide the player with choices and consequences which in reality are all just an illusion, then The Stanley Parable showcases and criticises the nature of those narrative constructions in video games. You are given various opportunities to not do what the voice tells you to do which leads to a range of interesting, but twisted events and endings - some are peculiar, some are rather sad and others are hilarious. During each ending though, the playthrough resets and takes you right back from the start where from there on it is up to you to do whatever you want, once again. Whilst this might seem weird, maybe even underwhelming since you begin to think that you just completed the ‚Äúgame‚Äù, in fact it is all a continuation. Each reset is a new experience where at least one thing is different from the previous playthrough. As much as I would like to discuss these events and endings, they should be left for the player to experience without spoiling anything. So, the"game"  indirectly encourages the player to break the flow of the narrative and does it in a very smart way, indeed.\n\nIt all comes down to the level design which was well thought out. At times, it even starts playing with your mind. It makes you question yourself: Are you in control? Or is the ‚Äúgame‚Äù? What if it is neither? Heck, it even mocks both you and itself, including The Narrator. The hidden story behind all this is rather deep once you uncover it. What it tries to achieve here is unprecedented. Additional praises include The Narrator‚Äôs voice acting which is excellent and the soundtrack that fits perfectly with the mood of the ‚Äúgame‚Äù. Visually, it looks similar to any recent Source game. It has a nice colour pallet and some of its aesthetics resemble something from Aperture Science. In truth, The Stanley Parable does many things right, it seems, making it very hard to criticise it for any flaws or to even be nitpicky. The most obvious observation would be that it is a very short ‚Äúgame‚Äù of up to four or five hours if you go for all its endings, I would say. It is even possible to complete it in about five minutes if you follow The Narrator‚Äôs instructions. However, based on its scope, I believe it has the right length and does not over stay its welcome. More would have definitely made it actually repetitive.\n\nIn conclusion, at the end of the day, I personally found the experience enjoyable and perhaps that is enough to warrant a recommendation. It is a not a traditional game, and I would even say that it is not a game. It acts almost like an interactive playground for the player to experiment various ways to break the narration. But it is uniquely designed, intelligently written and amusing at times. Yes, very creative. Actually, it might as well have the best narrative as far as I am concerned. Personally, I could not find any traditional faults with it, aside from having almost no "gameplay", if that counts. I will admit that this might be the first and only non-game which I really enjoyed. So if you are looking for a traditional game, then do not get The Stanley Parable. You will be disappointed. However, I strongly recommend it for its one-of-a-kind experience which should not be missed nor ignored.\n\nOne advice though: Do get it on a sale. I believe ten pounds, or your regional equivalent, is a tad too much for its amount of content, even if it is exceptional. Maybe that is its only flaw actually.","September 21, 2015","true","2.9"," 162 of 179 people (91%) found this review helpful 93 people found this review funny","91","162","179","93","0"

It is one of those "first-person walking" games in which you wander around a completely non-violent experience exploring the environment and unravelling the story, like Dear Esther.\nYou are Stanley, an office worker. Stanley has the job to push buttons on command until some day those commands abruptly stop. Stanley is leaving his desk to investigate, his actions are directed by a narrator who guides him through the office facility to discover the truth.\nThe Stanley Parable is a game about walking from A to B. As you approach a pair of doors, the narrator will indicate that Stanley takes the left one. Whether you do and how you decide to follow up your revolt or acquiescence, tilts the game towards wildly different conclusions. A playthrough may only take minutes, but The Stanley Parable has a lot of choices and a lot of different endings. It will take a few hours to see everything and every ending.\nAt each of the game's many intersections, you can follow the narrator's instruction or ignore it and face the consequences of your petty resistance. Each combination of choices leads to something unique. Some of these "endings" are lighthearted, some are absurd and many centre around the narrator's attempts to get back to his story.\nThe Stanley Parable has not the best Source Engine graphics. Many of the environments are bland, but deliberately so. Delightful hidden details show their faces everywhere if you are willing to look.\nThe best part of The Stanley Parable is the voice acting of the omnipotent Narrator. He plays witness to every move which do you make. From a kindly, yet firm, guiding hand at the start of the game to an acerbic wit if you ignore him, the Narrator really adds a soul to the world of The Stanley Parable.\nI enjoyed the game and I would recommend the game to people who want to try out something different instead of the normal games, but I would advice everyone to try out The Stanley Parable Demo before buying the game. It will tell you nothing about the main game, but you should then be able to decide if the game is something for you or not.\nIf you should still be unsure, you can also try the free mod, to make your final decision. The mod does not actually require Half-Life 2 on PC, only the Source SDK.\n\nSounds 8/10\nGraphics 5/10\nGameplay 3/10\nAtmosphere 8/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","November 28, 2013","true","27.9"," 409 of 537 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","409","537","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deviro/recommended/221910/","deviro","F|PFC. Deviro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deviro/","88 products in account","This short review/analysis contains spoilers about the game. Stop reading if you want to have a fresh experience with the game. Everything below is my speculation, don't take them as definitive facts.\nThe Stanley Parable is everything and beyond video games. It's a giant commentary on todays game development philosophy. Throughout its unexpected span and twisty narrative, it has a clear message - there are problems with narrative in video games, which we have not addressed yet.\nIn recent years we have seen a great amount of open world/sand box games. But there hasn't been shortage in linear games with strict control over players actions. Invisible walls or direct threatening by the game if you go off the map, even in scenarios where the level design suggests more freedom than the available and, but not limited to - bugging out the whole game or level by reaching unexpected locations are common practices in multiplayer and even in singleplayer games since decades.\nThe layout of the office (which is briefly explained in the museum, behind the scenes room) is designed and created with the mind that the dialogue and attention span of the player would balance and lead to the first sense of conflict - the two doors.\nThis first dilemma is presented geniously - with a confident and calm voice. At this point the narrator is still following the hardcoded written script. Which is what I describe as the main and simple story the whole Stanely Parable is based around - there is a problem, the protagonist decides to end the tyranny of the evil force and it concludes with a happy ending.\nThe simple story has cartoonish elements. Toward the end of it, it cultivates exaggerated tone and willingly becomes boring, it's purpose is to show the most basic and at the same time intriguing story. But only if the player obeys/follows the steps the given by the narrator.\nNot obeying the narrative, leads to all sorts of interesting results, which ultimately don't explain the whole picture of The Stanley Parable, which is left to players imagination. The game doesn't feel the need to address any of the questions which the audience asks frantically after playing it. The same happened in the demonstration, particularly in the 'Escape elevator' sequence.\nThroughout the exploration/ending hunting there are many sections where the nature of narration and design in games is examined and often made fun out of.\nMany actions, which are not part of the hardcoded script, of the player are directly commentated by the narrator.\nLike the 'Broom closet' - this room has no place in the whole game. In traditional game narrative it would be a waste of time - there isn't a collectable or extra life and if the player decides to explore it, the game would punish him for doing so. But here, the comedic nature of TSP rewards the player for paying attention to it, even if it is only a piece of dialogue.\nAchievements are another device with which the The Stanley Parable mocks the current video game industry. Take the 'Click on door 430 five times' for example  - a great way to address the ridiculous amount of pointless achievements in some games. Or 'Unachievable' - an obvious phantom which doesn't have a solution. It is created solely that particular part of the player audience grinds through the game, desperately trying to get it.\nSo, how does The Stanley Parable get away with being so rude to every aspect in the modern video game industry, while being part of it?\nIts complete and constant self awareness makes TSP simply perfect. It is written and executed exceptionally well. It deflects most of the criticism, directed at it, simply by being one.","November 25, 2013","true","5.6"," 380 of 504 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","380","504","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/221910/","Stefneh","Stefneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/","777 products in account","A gem in my opinion!\n\nThis is one of those games that I actually tell myself I‚Äôm so glad that I played. The concept of this game is great to me.\n\nYou play as Stanley. A man who works in a mundane job pushing buttons all day. Orders come through to his screen to push buttons and he does as told. One day, Stanley realises no orders are coming through, and that no one else is in the office. He gets up to see what‚Äôs going on.\n\nThat‚Äôs where we come in! You navigate Stanley around a very seemingly linear office, and quickly discover that you have a narrator dictating everything that you do, before you do it. Of course, leaving you room to either play out what he says, or go against it. You come to various paths and crossroads and are given the choice to either do what you‚Äôre told or not.\n\nWhat I love about this game is how it plays on pure human curiosity. If you go one way, you usually wonder‚Ä¶ but what would happen if I went the other way? There is many endings to the game, and as the narrator goes on with his story, you wonder what is true. If anything you‚Äôre being told is true, what the real story to the game is or if there even is one. It gets you thinking, and I love a game that‚Äôll make me think!\n\nI enjoyed this game very much. I have an odd ‚Äúfear‚Äù, kind of, of missing or losing things. So being given a game with many paths, endings and different things to find, admittedly I did OCD over it a bit and actually went as far as drawing myself a map (Don‚Äôt judge me). But it was a lot of fun! I had a great time playing this game and think it is something anyone could enjoy.\n\nThe graphics are nice. I wasn‚Äôt aware before, but this game actually started as a Half-Life 2 mod. As a standalone game I think it did really well for itself.\n\nThe characters are amazing. I love both Stanley, the narrator and the odd ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù they have with each other (Even though Stanley never speaks). The voice casting for the narrator is on point, I honestly couldn‚Äôt imagine the character any other way. He‚Äôs well-spoken and has a great charm about him. The narrator in ways kind of ‚Äútrolls‚Äù you a bit with how he tries to keep you on track or how he reacts when you go against him. But he‚Äôs a great character and that is important for a game so dependent on that character being entertaining.\n\nThe humour in this game was something I did enjoy quite a bit. The way things are done and played out I was quite impressed with.\n\nIn terms of achievements, a few can be a little tedious, but in ways you ain‚Äôt even mad. As said before the game can ‚Äútroll‚Äù you at times and it does so even more through the achievements. I would say that it‚Äôs still easy to 100%, but there is a few that you kind of need to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù to achievement. For example, an achievement titled ‚ÄúGo outside‚Äù, your task being to ‚Äúnot play The Stanley Parable for 5 years‚Äù. Which, come on!\n\nAll in all, I love this game and really think you should give it a try. If you like a good bit of humour and like your curiosity being tempted I think this game is a good one for that.\n\n\nTL ; DR : A great and unique game that tests your curiosity and gets you thinking. It has many endings to offer and generally is fun, definitely try it!\n","September 2, 2015","true","51.1"," 59 of 62 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","59","62","3","6"

Many games have had truly great lines in them. Who could forget that one to the left of the web on Tempest? The one that stretches out from the explosion in Minestorm? Ah, the beautiful lines that you crash your bike into in a game of Light Cycles. They were good lines. And as time went past, games got more lines. Then one day we decided that lines weren't enough and we had some triangles and we put the triangles together and we made videogames with triangles instead of dots and instead of lines and oh, what did we lose? But it was OK because then lines came back into fashion around 2006 and they sort of glowed too. Glowy lines! We made games with glowy lines and the lines in those games were great too. I didn't like the green ones so much in Geometry Wars but they were trying y'know?\n\nYears and years of great lines and yet, it took until 2013 for us to get THE BEST LINE. Ladies and everyone else out there, The Adventure Line is the best line in all of videogames. Let us take a moment to let that sink in. The. Adventure. Line.\n\nThe Adventure Line is the best line.

"Games" where the designer just wanted to tell a story and occasionally has the player click something to move the story along but the player's actions never actually mean anything. The Stanley Parable is very much NOT that sort of game. It has some legitimately profound things to say about narration and choice in games and storytelling, but it never comes off as pretentious. But I can't really say much else, because I don't want to spoil it. I normally hate vague reviews that tell you "just play it, I don't want to spoil it!" but... it's true. Trust me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/221910/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","I was very reluctant to give this game a negative review because I have mixed feelings about it, but ultimately, I would not recommend it to anybody else, especially not for it's full asking price. After playing it through a few times, I believe that the game just simply isn't worth the money, perhaps on a very generous sale, but even ¬£4.99 for that matter is a bit of a stretch. While I really admire the concept behind The Stanley Parable, which is what drove me to purchace the game in the first place, I personally found it to be dull and disappointing.\nThe Stanley Parable has lots of positive (yet, unhelpful) reviews, which ultimately leads anybody to believe that it's a fun game, that is the main purpose of a game, right? Unfortunately for me, the game just didn't live up to the expectations set, so I am relieved that I didn't end up paying full price for it (¬£9.99 in my case), if I had, I'd certainly have felt cheated, let me elaborate.\n\nThe game itself is appealing because it is genuinely interesting and refreshingly different, the trailer and the highest rated user reviews don't really give much information away because it genuinely would ruin the experience, but all in all, this is not a game, it is a lecture.\nThe Stanley Parable attempts to convey a message about game design and the illusion of choice, and while this message is conveyed well through the narration (great voice acting) it is in no way a fun experience. Sure, some of the dialog can be amusing, but that for me is the only positive factor.\nThere is no real gameplay and there are no real objectives, The Stanley Parable offers nothing more than a few hours of exploration around repetitive and dull scenery, waiting for the next line of dialog to pop up more often than not. I can't speak for everybody, but having to sit and listen for instructions on what to do next is not my idea of a fun experience, and even though the project is very well made and has a good concept behind it, I believe that you would have had the exact same experience just watching a play through of it.\n\nFans of the game tend to use the argument that if you don't enjoy The Stanley Parable, it's because you don't understand it, which I'm afraid is simply untrue. I understood the messages conveyed and I think the idea and crafting behind the game is clever and very unique, but all in all, I regret spending money on a game that turned out to be an unsatisfying lecture. The reason I buy games is to have a fun experience, and unfortunately I didn't achieve that at all playing this one.\n\nI firmly stand by my suggestion to avoid paying the full asking price for The Stanley Parable, but again, it's all down to choice. If you do feel compelled to buy it regardless of any negative reviews in favour of the (mostly) vague positive reviews, don't expect any actual fun gameplay, because I honestly believe there isn't any to be found here.\n\nPlease note that this review is purely my own thoughts and opinions, so I know there will be people that agree with me and certainly others that do not. If you are one of the people who purchased this game and felt that you had spent your money well, then excellent, I'm glad that you enjoyed the experience more than I did.","June 22, 2014","false","4.2"," 255 of 394 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","255","394","3","23"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepastisbeyondrecovery/recommended/221910/","thepastisbeyondrecovery","Vic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepastisbeyondrecovery/","690 products in account","Any individual with even the slightest or most remote interest in video gaming as a medium of artistic expression must categorically play The Stanley Parable within their lifetime. It's, ostensibly, a re-release of the 2011 Half-Life 2 mod of the same name, and is still built on the Source engine and is, more or less, largely the same game but having been thoroughly redesigned in certain key ways, especially its themes and parts of its narrative structure.\n\nThe Stanley Parable (developed by a small indie studio named Galactic Cafe) is, essentially, as its demo states, "a game of endings". It's a game that poses some very important questions about the way games currently work - it's a parable (a story which illustrates a lesson), or rather a collection of parables each hidden within another. Each new playthrough represents a new part of the experience, revealing yet another of the game's many endings, each with a different existential or absurdist lesson that build into the game's broader thesis.\n\nIt's also a game of choice, in that it proposes that ludic notions of "choice" and "free will" are inherently absurd in all games, since they don't actually represent any kind of meaningful or significant choice: they're just slightly different parts of the same overall plan that the game designer has laid out before you, and thus subordinate to his own intentions and choices; and therefore, inconsequential. You're still only just walking that path - in fact, all you ever do in the Stanley Parable is walk; literally. And when you do press the use button (which is for ludic purposes the mouse button, but in the original mod, was the 'E' button), you hear the unmistakable sound of a key being pressed. And as the intro and several endings exemplify, that is the nature of Stanley's job and ultimately, the nature of his existence and of our experience within the game: pressing buttons, both in-game and out of game.\n\nIt also has a lot to say about endings, and the way choices feed into those endings. By presenting us with a closed environment with very minimal and sparse mechanics, The Stanley Parable is able to present us with an environment so sparse and so limited that the "choices" we are offered seem that much more significant and that much more abundant; and the same goes for its endings. But as much as the choices themselves mean nothing, they also lead the player into the aforementioned endings. No ending has finality, and no ending presents a perfect victory for Stanley or the player. In fact, in almost all the endings the respective thematic conflict between Stanley and the Narrator remains entirely open, but no ending feeds into another in any capacity, underlining the lack of meaning the notion of multiple endings in games can offer. Games teach the player that anything but a perfect win-state is a failure, and that further playthroughs can objectively improve the conclusion of the story, be it through moral superiority or mechanical perfection. The Stanley Parable, in comparison, gives us subjective endings which can be interpreted freely which all invariably lead into a restart of the game. As the game itself states: "the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never LOADING".\n\nIn the process, certain themes and concepts will be left underdeveloped; but isn't this the point of the game? Asking questions that only subsequent explorations of the game by way of critical commentary or subsequent works in the same vein (perhaps by Galactic Cafe, or other designers) will be able to answer? Leaving its own ideas open to interpretation and exploration? I certainly think so. And so, it's definitely worth experiencing for yourself. Set your prejudices regarding "walking simulators" or "ungames" aside and walk into The Stanley Parable without any expectations but those the game designer creates for himself and for his own vision.","December 1, 2013","true","6.9"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","38","50","0","0"

In a nutshell, this ‚Äògame‚Äô is essentially an attempt by you, Stanley, to discover what has happened to your co-workers and bosses, all of whom have completely disappeared.\n\nThat‚Äôs the game in its entirety on a superficial level without giving away any spoilers. The underlying message is regarding the choice, or the illusion of choice, that modern video games allude to offer. The developers seem to be responding to games such as Mass Effect, that suggest they offer the gamer real choice in the outcome of the narrative yet in reality the gamer only has a couple of options dressed up in different clothing. There is a clear critique here regarding the nature of ‚Äòchoice‚Äô in the video game industry and while it is welcomed change for video games to include a metaphorical message (beyond the simplistic), these messages and critiques should not exist in a vacuum, devoid of any gameplay. The point being that, there is a thought provoking message here, but this is not a game.\n\nStripped down, the Stanley Parable is a game of ‚Äòwalk and listen‚Äô. Yes there are some interesting points mentioned by the narrator relating to conscious decision making, but this same message could have been offered through or alongside gameplay features that stretched beyond walking around a corridor. Quite simply, this is a lecture, a chore of a lecture that unfortunately lasts for 2-3 hours before you realise you could have just read the same underlying message in a free online article in about 10 minutes without being subjected to this gaming con artistry.\n\nClearly there is a sense that the Stanley Parable is offering some ‚Äòhigh art‚Äô by not including actual gameplay, or that this ‚Äògenius indie title‚Äô will have your head scratching. There is a suggestion that if you ‚Äòdon‚Äôt get‚Äô intelligent games that you won‚Äôt appreciate the Stanley Parable, that you can‚Äôt grasp its deeper message. Well, that is quite frankly a gross lie and yet a master stroke in marketing. People are desperately scrabbling to offer rave reviews of this new form of game, eager to show they are not cut from the COD cloth of gaming, that they can enjoy this intellectual critique. Do not be fooled. This is a totally unsatisfactory experience especially considering the price charged.\n\nDo you want a thought provoking experience about the intricacies of the mind and the illusion of choice? Read a book. This is just pseudo-philosophical gaming at its very worst, conning the masses into feeling like an intellectual giant for a couple hours at the small price of being tricked by the illusion of gameplay. Who‚Äôs more of a sucker in this scenario, Stanley? Or us?\n\n'The game will end, the game will never end'. Sold to us as an interesting game of uncertainty. Well, there is at least one certainty about the Stanley Parable; you will never see the cash you spent again.\n\nAs always comments are welcomed and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.","May 18, 2014","false","1.3"," 842 of 1,432 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","842","1","5","156"

To be honest, though, I sometimes think I should've spent my money on something else. Since there isn't an option to classify you're review as mixed, since there were parts I liked about the game, I'm just labeling it as negative (not because I completely hated it).\n\nThe Narrator is a really funny character and I laughed at a lot of his reactions. However, that's all I really found enjoyable. It's not that I didn't like everything else, it's just there didn't seem to be much else to do.\n\nYou get different endings depending on your choices, but after playing it over and over for a while I already got most of the obvious (as in "easy to obtain") endings and was just running in to them again and again multiple times. I know there's more complex things you can do to get different endings, which I don't mind, but it made me think I could've just easily looked them up on YouTube instead of spending $15. I was playing a game with no real challenge to prevent me from getting to those endings.\n\nI understand that it's supposed to be more an experience then just a game, but I personally didn't find it that philosophical with it's message and would've been better off getting an actual game on Steam. I'd have probably enjoyed this more if it was either for free or at a lower price.

The short story is greatly represented by a narrator that follows every move you make. Now if you think that's cool try Bastion too :P\n\nThe path you thoroughly follow it matters towards the end of the story; multiple endings, hilarious dialogues and tons of secrets. It might be a short story but It's a solid one, well made and worth every second. If I could rate it I would give a 11 out of 10 seriously.\n\n------\nNow there is an achievement called [Go Outside] "Don't play The Stanley Parable for five years." which I ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up... set my clock to 2021 and wrongly earned it without thinking decently.\nAfter 10 seconds .. I felt reallly bad. It was a mistake. I know that might sounds stupid but developers maybe had it for a reason. Luckily there is a command I found on steam discussions* that resets all 10-achievements to 0 and you must earn 'em again; a small price to pay.\n\nMoral: Don't rush things, just let 'em slide...\n\n*tsp_resetzaxis (~console)","February 2","true","8.3"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","16","16","2","2"

The demo is entirely original  content, and is easily as good as the main game.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nWith only about 3 hours worth of content and minimal replay value, it's hard to justify the purchase price. Pick it up if it goes on sale, though...\n\nSince the store page isn't very helpful, here's what the game is about. It's an exploration game in the same vein as Dear Esther or 30 Flights of Loving. You wander around looking at things and the environment is only minimally interactive. An extremely clever and witty narrator tells your story as you wander through the environment.\n\nGameplay uses FPS controls and there are few cutscenes to interrupt the immersion, but you will often find yourself trapped in a small area waiting for something. This is less annoying in The Stanley Parable than it is in other games since listening to the narration is basically the whole point of the game.\n\nThe plot moves along a lot like a choose-your-own-adventure. You'll be repeatedly sent back to the beginning of the game and need to repeat one of a few choices that select which ending you get. There aren't a lot of choices to make and only about 10 endings, but there are some random elements to the game and some of the endings have an effect on your next restart, so there is enough variety to keep the beginning of the game interesting even though you'll see it many times.\n\nThe plot is extremely witty, clever, and well narrated. The dialogue is easily as good as Portal II, even if the gameplay is rather bland. I liked it and I'm glad I played it, even though I feel I overpaid for it at $12.\n\nSubscribe to my curator page here\n\nView my other reviews here","October 20, 2013","true","9.3"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

Especially cuz of the amazing narrator. You can beat the game in less than 5 minutes or even speed run it. The key of the game is about making choices, and believe it or not, the narrator give comments on your choices, which will make you smile. Either way, it can go really deep too ... I played minecraft and portal in the game for some minutes, pushed a button million times to save a baby from fire but afterward failed anyway, I got litteraly mind-blown and I turned the game a few times off.\n\nIf you're not sure whether or not to buy this game, there's a demo available for you to try it.

Stanley's Parable is a game-shaped narrative experiment about game design tropes among other things. I don't want to say more but trust me, like or not, this is something you should play, even if it just for a little bit. Also, In an age with some many great indie game feature strong quirky narration, Stanley's narrator still stands out in the crowd. I could write a lot about Stanley Parable, but I don't have to because it has probably the best demo I've ever seen for a game, a demo that showcases the spirit and mechanics of the game but it's completely unique. Download it, and if you find it intriguing enough, then by all means, buy and play the real game.","June 24, 2015","true","3.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

Yes.\nIs it as mysterious and thought provoking as it is supposed to be? Yes, not in a bad way either.\nI do have to say visually the game was more impressive than I expected, it uses Source pretty well.\nThe narration is beautiful, but of course that's obvious.\nThe game works. It really does. It's a pretty far-reaching concept and yet it's a success.\n\nHell, it even manages to use the loading screen as a plot device.\n\nBottom line, if you love games, you'll most likely love The Stanley Parable.

Very few have a playtime longer than 3-4 hours, because that's really all you can stretch out of it.     One of the achievements requires running the game up to 24 hours in a single setting (although you can trick the game by editing your BIOS)  My own review would only show about 2 hours of actual gameplay. The rest, was idling for the achievement. Almost every review that shows a play time over 24 hours is misleading if you think they actually got that much time and attention out of it. You can literally see and pick apart everything in the game in just a few hours, especially if you are particularly clever.  I have 8 friends who currently own this, i combined all of their total play times. approx. 16 hours combined. Add in the actual 2 hours I was playing, and we're sittin at 18 hours total. Its not a tremendous value.\n\nI bought it at a 75 percent off sale, and I still feel they were asking too much.  Its just a source mod with some clever writing. I wished there was more game here, because there's nothing wrong with what you get ! The "game" and the experience it provides is great!  but the price, oh lord. that price.\nBeing such a high priced game and having all the positive reviews simultaneously, i expected a lot more.\n\nIf this was $3.75 or less (what i paid) I would change my review to positive. For 14.99, you could get so much more than what this will offer you.","July 2, 2015","false","27.1"," 133 of 230 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","133","230","5","15"

That Game You've Heard Of.Genre: 1st Person Self Exploration.\nDeveloped & Published by: Galactic Cafe\nPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nIs Stanley Parable a game? Are you a real person? Ok, you've probably gotten sick of hearing this joke when it comes to reviews about the Stanley Parable, so I'll knock it off. But cmon, I had to have a little fun. Yea, that joke was old even when I originally posted this review. So, time to put a bit of strikethrough it and put some actual effort into talking about the game itself. You play as Stanley, an office worker that wants something more out of life. Or maybe he doesn't. The game mechanics are simple: you walk through doors, hallways and rooms while listening to an excellent British accent describing what you are or aren't doing. Or going on a rambling about some unrelated happening. Or maybe its incredibly related and you don't realize it. Sometimes you'll push buttons, open doors or fall to your death. But really, those actions that you perform aren't what matter most. It's what you take away from the experience that matters. You'll be replaying the levels over and over again as different actions can cause different little "stories" to play themselves out. It's a pretty passive experience though as you can't really do anything other than choose minor actions at certain times.\n\nThis could have easily been a game stuck up on itself but it's clear that the developers want us to consider what it is to live this life and to play videogames. How we interact and deal with videogames on a regular basis. There's quite a bit more under the surface than even I gave it credit for after I finished playing it and watched some other people talk about it.\n\nPC Settings\nThe game comes with more PC settings than you could possibly ever want or need for a game like TSP. Resolutions, FoV slider, AA/Shader/Effect/Texture detail controls and much more. Everything is here, even support for high framerates. The game is very stable from all that I can tell and have heard. There is nothing missing that I can think you would need.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis is a title where I don't think it matters what I think. I think it's a title you need to explore for yourself and take away from it what you will. It is essentially a walking simulator, I won't deny that. And the player interactivity is minimal at best. But, I think its worth checking out. Take the time to appreciate what's being said and shown to you.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade.[kingisaaclinksr.com]","May 9, 2014","true","5.2"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

Honestly I can't stand them. They usually sacrifice graphics, gameplay, playtime, and other important things just so they can make "art". It drives me nuts when I see some stupid indie game with potato graphics get praised by everyone, break sales records, and generally make hipster gamers go on and on about "games as art" as if more standard games aren't art.\n\nStanley Parable does everything wrong (considering my above statement) but in the end it's all just right. Despite the fact that it's short, the gameplay is extremely limited, it can be a bit pretentious at times, and the graphics are just middle of the road Source engine, it's one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I have ever had the pleasure to engage in.\n\nFunny, sad, shocking, irreverent, serious, and ridiculous at different times, this game has an emotional and artistic depth that you just won't find in most other games. Down one passageway is an inspiring emotional moment, around the corner a silly laugh, across a chasm the 5th wall breaks entirely, and down a cleverly hidden walkway is an examination of art and life of a depth that you probably never thought you would ever find in a video game.\n\nBut the real star of the game, the part that kept me enraptured for every solitary minute is the Narrator. Equal parts comrade and torturer, he accompanies you through the entire game commenting on your every move, applauding every "correct" decision and chiding every "wrong" choice. His performance sweeping back and forth from inspiring highs to admonishing lows. He is the reason you keep playing, keep searching, keep digging to find more of the game. His happiness is yours, and equal parts his sadness.\n\nHonestly I cannot say enough good things about this game, but to praise it any more would require spoiling the manifold layers of the game, and the numerous surprises and hidden secrets this game holds. All I can say is, if you are ready for something different, unique, and emotionally resonant then this is the game for you.","June 28, 2014","true","8.0"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","2"

Since here begins the branching story of "The Stanley Parable".\n\nTSP is more or less an interactive adventure, a simpler version of the 80's game "Alter Ego" if you will. This goes along pretty well especially due the witty nature of the Narrator, which guides you through the game and choices.\n\nIt's overall cleverly written and dances between the ‚ÄúIt's oh so random‚Äù and ‚Äú2deep4you‚Äù themes so well, that you willingly fill the gaps and contradictions with your own meaning. This is one of the main reasons I believe that gamers and critics love it so much.\n\nWhat I liked:\n+: Cleverly written.\n+: The Narrator (I'm a sucker for british english anyway).\n+: Fitting ambient sounds and music.\n+: Includes some not very obvious (or I wouldnt had thought of that) routes which leads to other "endings".\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n-: It's short.\n-: The pricing imho is way to high.

What is obscene is what is hidden.‚Äù -Nagisa Oshima***Before beginning, I would like to give a special thanks to my fianc√© for proofing this review for me, as well as to wish her an early Happy Anniversary. Thank you for giving me the five most wonderful years of my life.\nWhat some consider to be an Indie gem while others plea confusion as to the course of this title, The Stanley Parable is a game about choice and consequence, with moderately brief journeys being the focus of play. The player takes control of Stanley, an office worker whose position entails the pressing of buttons throughout the day; the operation of these simple devices is his sole function, until one bizarre day, all of his coworkers vanish. From here Stanley leaves his office unprompted in search of some answers. I will do my best to refrain from writing this review in the identical joking tone of most writings, though the comedy in this title is infectious.\nHere are just a few reasons to give this memorably fantastic game a try:\n\nAtmosphere - This title progresses through Stanley‚Äôs well-crafted office space as the player maneuvers through the expected rooms and hallways that you would foresee composing a business department. I do not wish to spoil much about the broom closet, cargo lift, mind control facility, or other sections of The Stanley Parable‚Äôs branching story for the sake of having you experience them for yourself.\n\nGameplay - As stated in the introduction, players assume the role of Stanley from a first person perspective as he explores his abandoned office spaces, through multiple unique rooms and themes in order to discover the ‚Äòfinale‚Äô for the tale. The controls are simple, with the W, A, S, and D keys acting as movement commands; the Control key assuming the crouched position; and the LMB allowing the player to interact with various objects within the environment. There are both hidden and pronounced articles within the environment that can be toggled to alter story paths-covered in the coming section.\n\nWriting - As unambiguous as this game appears to be, this story-rich satire is far from any other market experience. The Stanley Parable performs as expected, with the players unraveling new beginnings and ends while probing for secluded secrets. Between these points of interest, the brilliant Kevan Brighting voices each interaction-or lack there-of-to entail a sense of accomplishment for the player, in the stead of simply stalling in a daft room until prompted otherwise. This commentary is extremely witty, and displays each critical action Stanley makes. In a sense, this is more of a powerful placebo to gaming: it takes the form of what you expect any game would yet lacks just the right amount of properties, toning it a simulation.\n\nTL:DR - As with the quote above, The Stanley Parable is an obscure game which presents the perfect amount of subtly in its processes. There can never be a proper review for The Stanley Parable due to how absurdly miraculous it is, yet every review written about it is the perfect review since it is that of individuality, such as with this title; the only true way to understand this title is to simply play it for yourself. As much as I would love to write on and on about this title, no words can do it justice, as it is difficult to pinpoint every exceptional portion of this work. I highly recommend this title to those who enjoy titles depicting choice and consequence, as well as narratives. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

This is not one of those games. The Stanley Parable is confusing and all-over-the-place, the main characters are inconsistent, sometimes depressingly shallow, other times infuriatingly opaque. The story spits on the ideals of internal logic.\n\nIf a video game makes you want to stop playing video games, what does that say about it?\n\nThe Stanley Parable dragged me into its tangled mass of content without much of a warning. During most of my time playing it, I had at best a vague idea of what was going on. And although it tried everything in its power to defeat me (at one point it was literally begging me to stop playing), I pressed on.\n\nThe game is ruthless in its mission of deconstructing the concepts of video game narration. It draws back the curtain and exposes the man who pulls the strings. Or pushes the buttons, as it were. Am I able to simply go back to normal games with normal stories, pretend I didn't gaze into the abyss? I can only hope.\n\nI think I've come reasonably close to hearing everything that The Stanley Parable has to tell. Its attention to detail is impressive, the love and skill that went into it easily apparent. At times I felt like Sherlock Holmes, with my personal Moriarty always one tantalizing step ahead. Other times I felt a sense of true companionship when my friend and I forged ahead towards destiny. Yet other times I was confronted with a sadistic psychopath, a gentle father figure, or a petty, passive-agressive bystander.\n\nThe Stanley Parable raises more questions than it answers. Fortunately they are the right kind of questions, the ones that keep you questioning yourself and the world around you rather than frustrate and paralyze you. I'm still relishing the afterglow, so my opinion may shift slightly when I've made more progress processing my experiences.\n\nRight now though, there is nothing about The Stanley Parable that I don't love.","October 29, 2013","true","4.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

It's about the relationship between the player and the game and the interactivity that makes this medium unique.\n\nThat's about as much as I can say about The Stanley Parable without giving anything away. There are no mechanics bound to your keyboard and mouse beyond move, look, open doors and push buttons. The central mechanic of the game is your choice and your perception of the game, incarnated as the Narrator.\n\nThe game is essentially a choose your own adventure book, elevated to become something truly special by excellent writing, one of the endings features a profound paradox, and phenomenal delivery by the Narrator.\n\nThe Stanley Parable is extremely clever, amusing and thought-provoking. An absolute must-buy, though I would recommend playing the demo first.\n\n<3","October 20, 2014","true","1.8"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

Perhaps your life is amazing, sad, depressed, happy...whatever. The choice is yours.\n\nThe gameplay is seamless. Perfect controls for the game. The graphics are also top notch. It actually looks like the Unity engine a bit, but if it was, the developer maximized what he got out of it. Some of the puzzles can be challenging, and deception factors in to some aspects of this game as well.\n\nThe narration however is really where this game is at. There are only two other games that I can think of that rivals this one in that regard (Battleblock Theater, Bastion), although their styles couldnt be more different.\n\nI have seen something like 18 different endings with this game. Not sure how many there really are, but there are a lot, and so as you can expect, there is a ton of replay value with this game.\n\nThe developer also had some fun with the achievements. One of them is to play all day (24 hours) on a Tuesday, lol. One is to play, and then play again a year later. Etc....\n\nThis game is an easy 10/10.

Right when I saw it on steam I had no idea what to think. All it shows is a bunch of office cubicles and computers, and the discription, though interesting, didn't really help me decide whether to buy it or not. I almost gave it a pass, until I heard everyone and their grandmother going on about, "Have you played 'Stanley Parable? It's AMAZING!' It's hilarious! It make's you question your existance!" So I finally decided to give it a try when I saw it on sale. And...\n\nIt's unbelievable. I never thought I could play something so hilarious, so drawing, so strangely thought provoking in my life. I honestly don't know where to begin because, and I know everyone whose reviewed this has said this but, I'm afraid I'll spoil something. I don't even want to upload any screenshots. Just trust everyone on this, this is a game that no one, I mean no one should pass up.\n\nOkay I'll give a little bit more detail, here's what I love best about it. Every joke works, I mean it. It has, what might be hundreds of jokes packed in there, and every one of them had me flinging my head back with laughter. A lot of the jokes are Fourth-wall jokes (and if you don't know what the Fourth-Wall is look it up on TVTropes.com), addressing the player directly. The game also likes to screw with you, but not in a scary way. As you progress the environment starts to change, sometimes drastically. To the point where you may throw your hands in the air and scream "What's happening!?" as I did at one point. The game may make you start to question reality as well...\n\nLook the point is stop reading this review and BUY THIS GAME! Every thing you've heard about it is true.

The Stanley Parable is -- to employ an outdated and well-trodden expression -- "like a Choose Your Own Adventure on crack".\n\nIt's a game about choice.  Your coworkers have vanished, and you are tasked with finding out why.\n\nWill you bother to discover where they went?  Or maybe you'll forge your own path.  But what consequences could there be for straying from the story?  What if compliance was actually...in your best interest?  Will you ever find the myriad secrets and endings tucked away?

For me, it is second only to Antichamber in my personal Top 10 list of great gaming experiences.\n\n(For those who have played the original, free HL2 mod of this game, it is WELL WORTH picking up this new retail version.

The narrator wants to guide the player, and then starts to complain when the latter does not follow the rules. A love-hate relationship grows between the player and the narrator.\nThe experience seems short but actually there are tons of branching paths (sometimes leading to different places and concepts), and the deeper themes of the game start to unravel. Choice and free will, a meta commentary on videogame narration and player agency, and so on.\n\nVery meta, very funny, each playthrough is short but sweet and got me excited to try new things and see how the narrator would react.","December 24, 2014","true","2.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Multiple endings and converations with several answers are merely an illusion of having a free will.\nEven the biggest roleplaying games feel like being on a railcar that drives you through a storyline in comparison with The Stanley Parable.\nThe duration of a single playthrough is short, but everytime you start anew, everything can and will be different. Even choosing the same path over and over again, will be different from the first, second and even third time you did.\nI highly recommend playing it, to give yourself the chance to see what a truly interactive game can be -- and not just by the watered-down definition the medium uses.\n","August 11, 2015","true","2.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Really unique and will make you listen and think, listening mostly, but still, this is amazing. It's really immersive, I also recommend playing the demo too (when in doubt or not) because the demo literally explains a lot of what you'll get in the main game, and you'll enjoy it as well. There are so many choices that will leave you craving to find out "What would happen if I do this?" and the game will give you unpredictable answers (mostly).\n\nI wish to see more games with this kind of uniqueness in the future.","November 30, 2013","true","4.3"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","1"

Do you listen to the voice, do you ignore it, do you prove the voice wrong, do you sometimes follow the voice. That's up to you.\n\nWithout ruining the game. You have the ability to retry the story and see how different decision may impact your success.\n\nThe narrator/ominous voice was very good (well chosen voice actor).\n\nI hope this game comes out with more contect (hopefully not having to purchase DLC) cause I would be interest to see if any changes occur if another option appears or another decision is made.","January 14, 2014","true","2.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

This is not a typical video game in the most common sense. Instead, it is an effective vehicle for some of the most important subjects pertaining to video games and their narrative. Where Dear Esther failed by wasting the video game medium for its narrative, The Stanley Parable succeeded by making full use of video game mechanics, and then subverts them in a humourous, and yet elegant way.\n\nThis game is designed to be played several times, and the real value of this game is to see what happens when you stray from the narrative that the game sets the player out to follow.\n\nI will not discuss the specifics of this game, as doing so will ruin the sense of discovery so vital to keeping the experience effective, Instead, I will tell you to go pick it up and experience it, several times.

It trys to discuss the probabilities that derive from obedience and rebellion, and to achieve a high-level of interaction between players and the game. I cannot allege it is successful, but this attempt is praisable.\n\nVarious endings is an attraction of the game. Among those endings, my favoriate one is the 'Crazy Ending', which will be achieved by walking down the stairs instead of up. The final narration is so good that it makes me feel I am Stanley, and being assisted by repetitive rooms, description of thinking and the style of stream-of-consciousness, it gives players an intense atomsphere and great immersive. Every ending is so distictive and interesting that can inspire players to try every choice over and over again. Under those circunstances, I think, it is as a metapher, instead of as a simple character, that should Stanley be defined.\n\nThe narrator is the most important role in the game. It is he who continuously pushs the story forward and guides Stanley into different endings. He can be regarded as a highlight and also a drawback of the game. His words and tone contribute to game's style and atmosphere, but also undermine it's reality. If most of the narration can be replaced by text and make it focus on pushing the climax(just like what he does in the Crazy Ending), it would be more splendid.\n\nExcept those advantages, this game is quite boring. Although it seems like players are exploring the game, but they not. All they can do is just walk along the routes that pre-designed by game-makers, and repetitive narration helps me comfirm it. Simply, throughout the game what players play is to choose 'left or right?'. It does provide some interesting things, but the gameplay and replaybility are poor. But you can regarded it as a voiced novel.\n\nAnother drawback is that the game is so short that players can beat it within 10 mins. Although it contains multiple endings and the plot will be changed just result from slight changes in choices‚Äî‚Äîit is still too short ‚Üí_‚Üí. $15 is too much, so I strongly suggest anyone who wants to try this game keep waiting for this game apparing in bundles.\n\nHow to define this game? Or, more prudentlyÔºåshould it be defined as a game?\nWithout a doubt it is a good experiment. Yet, compared with novels and movies of the same type, The Stanley Parable seems still primitive.","May 15, 2014","true","3.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/recommended/221910/","RJtheShadow","il Duderoni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/","537 products in account","Prepare for spoilers. Normally I don't spoil, but it's mighty hard with this one.\n\nTo enjoy The Stanley Parable, it takes a peculiar type of person. Or types of persons. There is no 'action' to speak of in this game. No guns to shoot and, debatably, not even a failure condition. (even if you CAN die...)\n\nI've been troubled in finding the best way to describe this game. People have called it a mind‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, something that messes with your logic. But from the moment I defied the narrator, I never felt like that. I didn't feel like I was being tossed around with. I felt like I was in a thought experiment. A thought experiment that got out of hand and resulted in other thought experiments, until it had evolved into a narrative in how I'm seemingly breaking the purpose of these by simply not cooperating.\n\nWhat I've concluded is that The Stanley Parable is a narrative genius. A statement on multiple facets. For example, the question can be asked how the power of the narrator compares to that of a hypothetical God? And what if the subjects in the universe the narrator and/or hypothetical god are ruling, become sentient?\n\nBut that's not the only question that can surface. Your question could be "how defiant can I be and not die? What if death is part of the pathway and continuing forward will actually result in a different outcome based on the fact that I died?"\nYes, that seems like a very long and convoluted question...\n\nBut that's what this game does. It makes you question the reality it resides in. The non-eucledian level design (Google it) means that any progress is progress permitted to you by the narrator. But then you reach a point where even the narrator questions their own power and choices.\n\nOr you could have taken such choices that angered the narrator so much that he instead turned confrontational and made you face the fact that, even if you are walking around, you are still an automaton of a human pressing buttons.\n\nMaybe you instead drive the narrator so desperate enough that his last resort is a splendor of a room with particle effects where he seems to feel at peace and happy, with your only physical choice being to stand there for eternity, or kill yourself, stealing away the narrator's happiness.\n\nIn that perspective, you could question whether you are Stanley to begin with. Maybe Stanley is a very complicated tool for you to control the narrator. Maybe you are the hypothetical God, whom's tenacity can undo or counter anything the narrator does or commands.\n\nI am far from done on describing What this game is like. The narrator could be a villain, a desperate companion, a frustrated writer... But what stands central is choice. You can only move and interact, but the choices you physically make can last so far that you wonder... not if you should do it, but what first?\n\nThe Stanley Parable can be funny. Can be sad, inspiring pity within. But should you really forget yourself? Who are you anyway? Are you even real? Do you even exist? Who says you are not dreaming this and are still pressing those buttons on that keyboard?\n\nBut there is one central truth to this game: It rewards semi-lineair exploration. It's not open world, but it can very much be explored and said exploration can get out of hand. And that's where the strength of the storytelling comes\n\nIf you like narration, spoken by a very skilled narrator, and like to pay attention to the story (as non traditional as this very much is) then you'll be in for a treat.\n\nBut again, I can't state this enough: this is not a game for people who only wish action and effects. Such people will probably find this a boring experience, so be forewarned. If you can bring yourself to slow down your pace and allow yourself to think, you may yet enjoy it.\n\nBecause I sure did. As an amateur writer, The Stanley Parable has employed many narrative tools and tricks, chastizing or rewarding you for falling for them, or not doing so at all. Carrots on a stick and red herrings, It is a thought experiment encompassing several of it's kind with a carefully laid out madness.\n\nI wish I could keep on writing about this game. But I have to stop at some point.\n\nGood job, Galactic Cafe.","December 26, 2014","true","2.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The story is self-explanatory enough (and I do not want to spoil it, that is half the fun), and the mechanics is just brilliant. I would and I will just say this: the game itself is amazing, but the best part is the thought behind such a concept, and will ask you some questions that you will never think of when you are playing other games.\n\nIf you want another CoD / HL2 shooty-blasty-killing FPS variant, this is not the game that you want, BUT...if you want to play a thought-driven experimental with will-crafted humor like Portal, you would enjoy this game as much as I did, and remember this experience for a long time.\n\nAs for the price itself, I almost got every content within the eight hours that I played, so the original price is not that good compare to other games that can let you be enjoyable for hours and hours for 15 bucks (or less). But I think the price is well worth-it if you got it on sale (I got it for 40% off and I'm satisfied for the content at the price).\n\nI would strongly-suggested that you do not read any reviews that contains spoilers, any videos that has gameplay footage on it, and even the trailers that posted on this very page, just experience it (demo or the full game) and enjoy, employee 427.","December 7, 2013","true","9.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","1"

You will learn to hate yellow lines and enjoy letting babies die in fires.\n\nMost games that attempt to be such a  deconstruction  are doomed to wallow in their own artiness.

The narrator is perfectly voiced and for such a simple 'adventure' game its extremely diverse in the sense that there are plenty of endings, easter eggs and secrets, a lot of which I haven't even found yet. The achievements are fun and fairly simple. A game that I thought I'd speed through, enjoy the humour and never look at again has become a game that I am constantly coming back to and finding new little things every time.\n\nI'd recommend this to almost anyone. If you like the Portal humour then you'll definitely like this.","January 19, 2014","true","7.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
