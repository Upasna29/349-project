I'm not a big fan of platformers but the colour and smooth movements allured me to this game. The strongest points to this game are the music and the atmosphere in which the game creates which is very impressive and I am so fortunate that you can purchase the soundtrack.\n\nThe game has a unique 2D - 3D movement to it. It's hard to explain but for purposes I will attatch my 20 minute preview video. In the game you also have collectibles, broken robots to repair and keys to unlock secret areas (which are colour coded)\n\nIf you are a big fan of platformers then I highly recommend this game, it to me is a gem which has come from Greenlight and the developers should give them self a big pat on the back. The only aspects I cannot mention are a) Longevity and b) enemies -  (I didnt find any enemies in my 20-30 minutes of playing).\n\nFeel free to take time to watch my video for a more better idea as I'm not too great with writing. :)\nThank you very much for reading and a big thank you to the devs/publishers for the key to go ahead and preview the game.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wx122ok0g2o","November 3, 2015","true","4.2"," 52 of 69 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","52","69","5","2"

It's got a really good sense of adventure and exploration to it, which I like.\n\nBut the game still needs a lot of polishing. There's tons of bugs, and the platforming physics are still pretty wonky. Often you'll respawn just to instantly die again. Or you'll mess up a jump because sloped platforms have wonky physics. Somestimes bits of background scenery just randomly disappear. Nothing gamebreaking overall, but it adds up and becomes very annoying.\n\nI completed the game, and would have liked to go for 100% completion, but I won't do that until the game is improved.\n\nAnother tip for the dev: Can color-blind players tell the difference between the keys?","November 7, 2015","true","3.5"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","25","30","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/332620/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2003 products in account","PONCHO is a 2D platformer that relies on a specific mechanic to tell its story and to keep the experience fresh and challenging. I had already been astonished by the pixel art that I saw on the store page, but I was even more surprised when I saw everything in motion.\n\nPONCHO’s core mechanic allows you to switch planes. You press one button to switch to the background and another button to switch to the foreground. Besides this, one thing I really liked was the fact that there is no hand holding. You’re thrown into an unknown world and you have to figure your way around. Soon enough you find some kind of robot characters which I found out to be really intriguing. How did they get here, what or who are they? I was intrigued by this whole mystery by finding myself lost in this world. I love that. It is a thing very few games are able to do.\n\nThese characters kept mentioning something about a great calamity and the fact that the maker has abandoned them. That said, the game starts very mysteriously and it’s only right at the end that the story makes sense. At the end you’re able to choose one of two different endings, but either one or the other is a though choice to make.\n\nThe game itself is divided into several levels and each level is subsequently divided into several areas. You change areas by either going to the left or right edge of the area you’re currently in. On each level there’s a certain number of red orbs and keys that you can collect. The red orbs can be used to purchase keys from a merchant. You’re not necessarily obliged to collect them all and they don’t affect the outcome of the story in any way. Still, keys allow you to unlock new areas, so if you want to explore everything you should collect every single key and red orb you come across .\n\nVisually, I think that the pixel art is just on point, it reminds me of Fez to some extent, and the game also has some lovely chiptunes. The backgrounds are very detailed and there are some pretty cool looking particle effects. The game allows you to visit different environments such as a tribe vilage and a junkyard. There is also an underwater section which I found to be really cool. In this part you had to press a different button to see in 3D, so you could distinguish what was on the background and what was on the foreground.\n\nMy only complaint is the lack of checkpoints on certain areas, which I think might annoy some people. For example, right on the very last platforming section of the game, I spent well over 30 minutes trying to climb a tower. One small misstep and I would fall to the bottom and had to do everything all over.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, I was really surprised by PONCHO. I had my suspicions if it was going to be able to hook me and if it was going to differentiate itself from other platformers. I’m happy to say that those suspicions were misplaced and that I enjoyed my entire time with it (apart from the slight frustration explained on the previous paragraph). I highly recommend it to platformer fans or for those who are looking for a mysterious and charming world to explore.","March 15","true","6.8"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/332620/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","This key was obtained from the developer for the purposes of review\n\nSummary:\nA hard one to really call here, as the base gameplay that's present and the unique gameplay mechanic of going into the foreground/background does make a game that's appealing on the surface. It's got the presentation down: despite it being another pixel platformer, the use of that aforementioned background/foreground goes a long way, and helps create an experience that many may not have seen before. It definitely provides good puzzle based elements to the game to complement it's mechanics, and it can be great for those liking exploration elements and “collectathons” with having to find elements. What drags the game down however is what causes the negative elements in the game: The checkpoint system, and vertical level designs. This game has a high frustration factor, which is compounded by several little problems that forces you to re-do large sections over and over again in the worst way. Checkpoints are based on time on platforms, and it shows lots of flaws as opposed to a generic checkpoint system because of it. In addition, the gameplay causes inconsistencies with times where you have no idea how to get through a section, and having to wait for platforms to get into place for large amounts of time. The negatives are what's going to make/break the game for you: it broke it for me as it caused too many problems for me as a whole. But if you can tolerate it, you've got an experience that is worth your time.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/FbeBy-2jTcY\n\nLists:\n+:\nStrong Presentation beyond typical 2D “good” pixel artwork, as works elements of foreground/background well into the presentation. Smooth animations help this.\nUnique enough to stand out against it's competitors due to it's foreground/background/back-background mechanic, and the additions of the hazards introduced here.\nWorks well from a puzzle exploration standpoint, and gives people who love collect-a-thons a reason to try to find new ways to get through the map.\nLike how certain locked doors can be gotten around with the unique mechanic, and it feels purposeful.\nHas that Charm factor with the main character, instantly likable despite not saying anything, and reasonably good character design all around.\nPerforms well with no frame rate drops or problems of that sort.\n-:\nVery High Frustration factor. Too High for my tastes.\nA problematic checkpoint system can cause large amounts of progress to be removed thanks to one mistake, and it doesn't help that possible learning mechanics are lost due to the time it takes to get back to the obstacle in question.\nVertical level designs really compound the 2nd negative point, as you'll have to do large sections of the game over again because you'll fall into an earlier part of the level.\nTime elements can be annoying due to having to wait for significant periods of time for platforms to line up. While we've seen this in games past, this game in particular have very, VERY long wait times.\nBack-BackGround/Background/Foreground can cause confusion at times as you don't know what's in the foreground, or the “midground” as it were. Which is then compounded by points 2+3 on this list, making it hard to really want to get back into the game's groove.\nFeels like there's a slight problem with edge mechanics and jumping, like being too close to an edge affects jump mechanics too much.\nDirection issues at times on how to proceed through an area, especially when a wrong move means a lot of repeat work.\nThis game in particular has negatives that feed off each other, enhancing each other. While you can isolate some problems in some games, this is one of  those cases where it just hits all the worst points at times.","November 3, 2015","false","3.7"," 38 of 61 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","38","61","2","2"

IT IS HELL. Go for the final level only when you are ready for some high-paced, quick decision-making platforming in three planes.\n\nPoncho has very interesting multi-plane drifting system as it’s core mechanic.\nYou can switch between the front plane, middle plane and far plane any moment you like, providing there is enough space for you to fit there.\nThis allows you to use perspective as your ally: if the pillar is too high to jump on, just switch the plane, jump, and when Poncho is seemingly above the pillar — switch back.\nVoila, you are standing on top of “unreachable” pillar. There are lots of tricks with that system for you, it’s really fun and puzzles are actually good.\nDevelopers made sure to utilize their core mechanic right.\n\nI've mentioned that you can always re-explore previous levels. But what’s the reason to explore a level you’ve already cleared?\n1. You can find and unlock 2 abilities in game. One of them, for example, will allow you to stomp the floor and discover secret areas.\n2. Collectibles of sorts: keys, memory chips, secret characters, and dead robots to revive (Glory to the Robot King!)\n3. Secret areas. These are mostly caves of various sorts, but there is one really cool location where robots are partying hard, and planes keep clamping together.\n\nThe game is aware of it’s own amount of content - it has few twists and puzzle mechanics, but it utilizes them well.\nIt also has just the right length not to get boring, and two endings.\n\nSo grab it on Friday, sit back, listen to music, relax, solve puzzles and explore.\n\nSadly, most people didn’t give Poncho a chance, SteamSpy estimates its owners at 1-1.5k but I hope that this review helps more people to discover this game.\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scifer/recommended/332620/","Scifer","Scifer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scifer/","132 products in account","I’ve always had a bit of a soft spot for cute story worlds with dark, mysterious undertones - and Poncho here is no exception! It’s a pixelated post-apocalyptic perspective-based puzzle-platformer (try and say that without spitting everywhere) set in the overgrown ruins of a futuristic dystopia. All assemblance of animal life is missing. Even the tiny snails lurching along the stalks of pixelated grass are entirely robotic. The machines have taken over and formed a society of their own. But, much like an allegory for the current decline of the mobile games industry, a society cannot function on shameless cloning and metric data alone. The machines lack the human quality to innovate and evolve and subsequently digress into small tribes of nomads. Now they wander the earth, falling apart, cursed by their own immortality as the last computerized image of a human face slowly decays from their rusting harddrives. Into this bleak arena steps Poncho, a small blue mini-fridge with a tablecloth stuck in his door, on a quest to find the illusive creator and restore humanity to its former glory.\n\nPoncho plays like a condensed version of Fez, another pixelated perspective-based puzzle-platformer (spit spit), but unlike Fez, the developer of Poncho hasn’t been ostracized from the internet for declaring war on his critics, playerbase and youtube lets-players; so pre-emptive brownie points for you, Delve Interactive! To contrast the mechanics of Fez, instead of spinning the entire world around on axis, Poncho exists within 3 or 4 two-dimensional ‘layers’ in the background and foreground, allowing the player to platform jump between them in order to collect keys and shiny red floating sweeties. This makes for some mind-bending exploration puzzles when the platforms are static, but it becomes downright infuriating when the platforms start to move a few levels in. Not the standard left-to-right floating platforms most gamers have become accustomed to. The floating platforms in Poncho shift through every dimensional layer within the Z-axis of the gamespace.\n\nThis led to multiple situations where I would mistime a jump, land on a platform, only to have the existential rug ripped out from under my feet, or worse - get blindsided in mid-air by a shifting platform as it suddenly occupied the same space as Poncho, smashing the last hope for humanity into quantum glitch soup. The constant shifts between orthographic and perspective views can give the player a rather sketchy view of where they reside spatially. Luckily, Poncho has opted for the Super Meat Boy school of design in that the time between ‘death’ and respawn is almost instantaneous. It's difficult without being punishing.\n\nHowever, Poncho isn’t all about the platform dimension jumping. There is also quite a strong focus on exploring the open world and being able to come back to any level during the game to collect any keys, sweeties or powerups that you may have missed. Boasting an ‘open world exploration’ element in a game like this is usually shorthand for back-tracking. Fortunately, the level design is fairly tight and succinct, meaning that the player doesn’t have to retread too much ground in order to reach new heights -unlike Fez, where the landscape was so vast and complex that my desire to explore it would evaporate almost immediately. Poncho does its best to keep the next little shiny red breadcrumb always in sight of the player, giving them a firm idea of areas they haven’t explored yet. There are also a couple of fun secrets and easter eggs to keep the completionists checking under every rock!\n\nAs a whole, I found Poncho surfing the knife-edge between challenge and controller-smashing frustration. If you fudge a jump, it’s your fault for not thinking ahead X amounts of steps. Perhaps this will amalgamate to that wonderful ‘good’ kind of frustrating which will keep more determined players slogging away until they get it right. But what really sold me on Poncho is the charm of the characters within. It’s show-don’t-tell for the most part, which intrigues me to improve my platforming skill if only to reveal a little bit more of the world!\n\nSo if you have a high tolerance for MeatBoy-esque difficulty and enough spare controllers and keyboards to justify hurling a few against the wall, love cute colourful storyworlds and little robot folk, Poncho is for you. For this is the way the world ends. Not with a bang, but a whimper ... as the player misses a platform jump for the umpteen-billionth time.","November 4, 2015","true","9.4"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","13","19","2","0"

Shifting between background planes opens a world of possibilities and fully encourages exploration, but it comes with its own grievances as well. An over-abundance of backtracking, secret paths necessary to progress and challenge repetition will mar the experience somewhat. Regardless, anyone willing to look past these will find a mostly non-intrusive philosophically engaging storyline coupled a retro themed, visually stunning experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jackawaka/recommended/332620/","Jackawaka","Jackawaka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jackawaka/","300 products in account","Please bear in mind whilst reading this review that I was given a review key for this game.\n\nAfter getting an hour of playtime, I feel safe to say that I am able to provide a first impressions. PONCHO is a 2D platformer that focuses around exploration and a gameplay mechanic that allows the player to leap between 'layers', allowing them to jump into the foreground or background.\n\nThis game is inspired by FEZ and wears that fact on it's sleeve. The aestetic has been clearly been designed to look similar, but with it's own unique twist from the creator. The main mechanic itself is also very reminicent of FEZ, changing between 2D layers but in a 3D world. The way plot is communicated is slightly similar, in which you can talk to the robots around the levels and they give small snippets of information and character. Another similarity is the use of the 'glitchy' aesthetic and effects at the beginning, I'm not sure how I feel about it, unsure if it's well executed. Lastly, both titles decided all-caps were a good idea.\n\nThe game runs smoothly on average pc's however runs much slower on lower end pc's. This is evident of the huge frame drops on the main menu with the less powerful machines, however the drops arent as bad in game till you get to the larger and more detailed levels. The game is capped at 60FPS and there are no options within the main menu or the main game to change this. The game contains seperate music and sfx sliders although only one graphics option to change between "low" and "high". The game size itself is very small and is only around 300mb.\n\nThe "Lower end pc" I used for testing had an old 2.4Ghz processor, 4 GB of ram and a Nvidia Geforce 9800. I have also tried the game on a laptop with an 1.7Ghz i3, intel HD graphics and 4GB of ram, it ran at around 20FPS with occasional drops of 3-4 frames. The "average pc" (still quite low specs) has a duo core 3.3Ghz pentium, 8GB of ram and a superclocked Nvidia GTX 960, it ran the game at a solid 60 without any drops.\n\nGameplay wise, I could see where the game was going. The initial level attempted to teach you all of the basic mechanics within one level, there wasnt really much hand-holding aside from showing control prompts. The first level has been designed in a way that is similar to metroid, allowing the player to go at their own pace and then adding a timer for a small amount of pressure. Although I felt a bit cheated when I reached the end and the timer reduced itself to 10 seconds to make it look like I just got out by the skin of my teeth (but if you didnt notice the jump in time it would have been quite tense). The gameplay gives you a level, and tells you to explore it, you can travel to different levels once you reach the teleporter, but you can go back to previous levels to get secrets that you were unable to get with the powerups you currently had.\n\nOverall, this game takes FEZ and mashes it with a bit of a bit of metroidvania. You can quickly run through the levels however there are plenty of secrets to get by heading back to earlier levels.","April 24","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
