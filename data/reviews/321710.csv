I attempted several times to get beyond the "training" mission...to no avail. So, you have no choice but to fly the traning mission...over....over...over...and over. The game is apparently not suppose to do this. After the training mission, you are suppose to go on actual missions. But, the the game will not let you. SO....the game's software is CORRUPTED! I am sending a message to Customer Service ...  and ask for my money back.","May 7, 2015","false","9.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"
