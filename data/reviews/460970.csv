I was part of the beta test for the Steam release and additionally finished the first game three more times and second twice. I greatly enjoyed the games for their simplicity and also depth. I'm not sure I could put the games into a specific genre, however they remind me of a mix of tower defense, real-time strategy, and puzzle games. The simplicity of the games comes from only having three unique warrior types that can be summoned, only being able to have 3 - 5 warriors active at a time, and only one special attack.\n\nWhile this may not sound like much, the depth of the game comes from the amount of combinations for placing the warriors and also what upgrades to purchase at the store. Unlike a typical tower defense game, you can recall your summoned warriors and place them elsewhere, which also restores their health, and both of these strategies are important to master on later levels.\n\nThe puzzle element comes from the levels themselves, where walls will crumble and new enemy portals will open unexpectedly. You will also have to decide the optimal order to trigger switches as they open portals sending waves of enemies at you. The extra challenge levels are also much more puzzle like as they often have limited resources, which requires figuring out specific strategies to complete them.\n\nA play through of either game will be about two to three hours, with my fastest time just under 1.5 hours in Soulcaster 1. Finishing the game unlocks hard mode and the challenge rooms. I don't consider the game length to be a detriment to the experience and instead it means I am more likely to go back to playing them again given the low time commitment.\n\nThe music is also great and fits the game nicely.\n\nI think the list of cons for these games will vary pretty widely by player, so I am not going to go into what I consider weaknesses. Instead I would encourage trying the games to see for yourself if you like them, which is a pretty low risk given the Steam refund policy and with the games being so short.","May 25","true","16.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

He is awesome and is the creator of one of my other favorite puzzle series, Escape Goat.  If you haven't played Soulcaster Parts 1 and 2, they are definitely worth your time.  They are a mix of tower defence with action and rpg elements...it's hard to explain but that is because it is so unique.  Honestly for this price ther is no reason not to buy them.  They are worth much more.  Just to be clear I owned these games from their initial release so although there is a low play time for the Steam version, I have put many hours into the series.","May 24","true","0.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

However, Soulcaster suprisingly innovates in the way the tower defense system is implemented.  Unlike Defender's Quest that uses a basic ressource management to handle defenses, Soulcaster system is based on selecting the right defense (from the 3 Soulstone you collected) and moving them along with you as you progress in a level. Each defenses have its pros and cons, so you need work out the best strategy from level to level.  This make the game much easier to play than usual tower defense games where you need to worry constantly about your ressources for placing the right defense at the right time.  But although it is easier to play, it does not make it un-interesting at all...\n\nGood game from a developper most likely worth to follow.\n\n\n","May 25","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Nice looking sprites and excellent music.  Kind of similar to Defender's Quest, with the main difference being that you control a character that you can move around.  It's a bit short.  The first game took me about 2 hours on normal, and it sounds like the second one is about the same length.  There is a hard mode and challenge levels to give it some replay value.","June 3","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
