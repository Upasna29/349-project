Spent countless hours skirmishing with friends. I got extremely hyped when I saw it come to Steam and I just had to instantly buy it and replay it asap.\n\nSure, its rough around the edges, has wonky controls, not the best voice acting or fluid animation. But when you pull off a dumbass combo and 1 shot ♥♥♥♥♥es its worth it.  When you just about get the hang of it and crank up the difficulty to max, and go fight and win against That Man? After he AoE's you to death in a top down view that is so frustratingly awful to control? Satisfaction, pure bliss, a big '♥♥♥♥ you, you cheap ♥♥♥♥ of ♥♥♥♥'. I beat yo' ♥♥♥!\n\nIts not a fighting game like its predecessors and its latest title.  This is a macro-micro intensive game, think star craft, well... don't think star craft, think of a fighting game that took command and conquer into a back alley, had sex with it, and this is its love child. Think Smite with minion control.\n\nThis is my go to, to settle a disagreement with my friends, and this is who you should play it with, friends because it will go stale real fast otherwise.\n\nDon't get me wrong, core features are definitely missing, I didn't expect much but a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port, which it currently is. Luckily for me I had an xbox controller and it functions just as I expect it to. It plays at a solid frame rate, bare bones but enough for me to enjoy. Knowing how this was left to rot on the Xbox 360, especially in Europe. I was dead excited to see that Raven is PLAYABLE. I would recommend playing with a controller for the time being. The launch is a bit... eh. But I can live with it. GIVE ME THE DAMN ENGLISH DUBS SO I CAN HERE PARADIGM SPAM "EXPERIENCE, EXPERIENCE THE GRAVITATIONAL- EXPERIENCE." You'll get tired of repeated lines like this very quickly and it may drive you mad. But I just look at the funny side of it.\n\nAll in all I would give it a personal 8/10\n\nBTW If you are that guy who buys all the elites, pockets them and then drops them at the enemy master ghost.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedSavarinC/recommended/437000/","RedSavarinC","Red","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedSavarinC/","91 products in account","- Review in French below / Version française en-dessous -\n\n\nNo, this is not a Guilty Gear fighting game.\nNo, this is not a Warriors-like (Dynasty Warriors...) game either.\nYes, in its current state, this port can be slightly buggy and rough around the edges.\n\nSo, what is it? Well, it's hard to describe. It's some kind of MOBA with minion control mixed with a beat 'em all. It can sound awkward, but it does feel original. I will probably update my review when I have finished the game (or even before), but right now, it is a good game in my opinion.\nAlso, note that this game, while not a fighting game in the Guilty Gear series, is just as canon as Xrd or Vastedge (which is not a fighting game either). Because yes, it introduces some characters and concepts that are mentioned and used in Xrd. I also suspect that Guilty Gear 2 has evolved through time in such a way that it give birth to Guilty Gear Xrd, hence their link story-wise.\nThe music is pretty nice, especially the battle themes (the ones that play when you fight another master) : these were composed by Daisuke Ishiwatari, the composer of... well, almost all of the Guilty Gear soundtracks, actually. The rest of the music you can hear in the rest of the game was composed by someone else, and since I haven't read the credits, I don't know who it is, sorry.\n\nShould you buy it now? That all depends on what you want.\nIf you want a fighting game, that's not it.\nIf you want a game with an original gameplay, you should try it.\n|*]If you want to learn more about the GG lore, you might want to play it as long as you like the gameplay itself (else you might just want to watch a playthrough).\nIf you want a game with the latest graphics, this game doesn't have them; it's merely a port from a 2007 game right now, and some graphics options and tweaks are coming in the next updates, such as fullscreen and resolution settings. Also, you must know that there are some issues right know, with the depth of field and bloom settings being setup incorrectly, resulting in blur and too much brightness and the first update has just disabled DoF. This, too, should be corrected soon since the console release didn't have this problem.\nIf you want a polished port (which you could expect from Arc System Works), you should come back in two weeks or so until all the major quirks are fixed, such as full keyboard (and mouse) support, all the DLC included natively (because it will, but right now it is missing) and ranked matches. And the "exit game" function has been added, which is very welcome.\nIf you trust ArcSys with this port (or want the music that's included), you should grab it before the launch sale ends.\nOverall, a pretty good game, but a port missing quite a lot of features at the time I'm writing this.\n\n\n\n- Version française -\n\nNon, ce n'est pas un jeu de baston Guilty Gear.\nNon, ce n'est pas un jeu Warriors-like (Dynasty Warriors...).\nOui, dans son état actuel, ce portage peut être bugué et sérieusement manquer de polish.\n\nDonc qu'est-ce que c'est? Eh bien c'est assez difficile à décrire. C'est un genre de MOBA avec un contrôle sur les sbires, les creeps, les larbins (appelez-les comme vous voudrez) mélangé avec un beat 'em all. Ca peut sembler bancal dit comme ça, mais c'est en réalité plutôt original. Je mettrai sans doute cette évaluation à jour quand j'aurai fini le jeu (ou même avant), mais pour l'instant, je trouve que c'est un jeu plutôt bon.\nAussi, notez que même si ce n'est pas un jeu de baston dans la série Guilty Gear, il fait tout autant partie du canon que Xrd ou Vastedge (qui, lui non plus, n'est pas un jeu de bourre-pif). En effet, il introduit certains personnages et concepts mentionnés et réutilisés dans Xrd. D'ailleurs, je suppose que Guilty Gear 2 a tellement évolué au cours du temps qu'il a fini par donner naissance à Guilty Gear Xrd, d'où leur relation au niveau de l'histoire.\nLa musique est plutôt sympathique, notamment les thèmes de combat (ceux qui se lancent quand vous affrontez un autre "maître") : ils ont été composés par Daisuke Ishiwatari, le compositeur de... ben à peu-près tout le reste de la musique de Guilty Gear. Le reste de la musique du jeu a été composé par quelqu'un d'autre, et étant donné que je n'ai pas encore lu les crédits, je ne sais pas de qui il s'agit, désolé.\n\nLa question fatidique : devriez-vous l'acheter maintenant? Tout dépend de ce que vous voulez.\nSi vous voulez un jeu de baston, ce n'en est pas un.\nSi vous voulez un jeu au gameplay original, vous devriez l'essayer.\nSi vous voulez en savoir plus sur l'univers de Guilty Gear, vous pouriez avoir envie d'y jouer, à condition d'apprécier le gameplay (sinon vous pourriez aussi juste vouloir regarder des playthroughs).\nSi vous voulez un jeu au top des graphismes, ce n'est pas ici; c'est juste un portage d'un jeu de 2007 en l'état actuel, et certaines options graphiques et des réglages arriveront dans les prochaines mises à jour, comme le mode plein écran ou des options de résolution. Aussi, vous DEVEZ savoir qu'il y a quelques problèmes avec cette version, avec la profondeur de champ et le bloom mal réglés, résultant en un écran flou ou trop lumineux selon les conditions et la profondeur de champ vient juste d'être désactivée avec la première mise à jour. Ceci aussi devrait être corrigé bientôt étant donné que la version console n'avait pas ce problème.\nSi vous voulez un portage bien fini (ce que vous pourriez attendre d'Arc System Works), vous devriez repasser dans deux semaines ou quelque part par là, d'ici à ce que tous les gros problèmes soient corrigés, comme le support clavier (et souris) complet, tous les DLCs inclus nativement (parce que oui ils vont l'être, mais là ils ne sont pas présents) et les matchs classés. Aussi, la fonction "quitter le jeu" a été ajoutée, ce qui est bienvenu.\nSi vous avez confiance en ArcSys pour ce portage (ou que vous voulez la musique fournie avec), vous devriez le prendre avant la fin de la promo de lancement.\nGlobalement, un jeu plutôt bon, mais un portage auquel manque un bon paquet de fonctionnalités à l'heure où j'écris ces lignes,\nNotez aussi que le jeu est dispo avec le texte en Français, c'est toujours bon à savoir (même si je joue avec le texte en Anglais, donc je ne peux pas juger de sa qualité.","April 3","true","5.2"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","29","34","4","0"

I've been a Guilty Gear fan for over a decade, and even I missed this game back in 2008 due to never having owned an xbox 360, but good old Arc System Works never fails to deliver, finally releasing this on PC!\n\nMy past experience with Overture is entirely based on watching various playthroughs just to watch the story unfold, but now that I can actually play this for myself, it's become one of my top favorite GG games to date. The best way I can describe it is if RTS games and 3D fighters came together to have a weird but wonderful child, unfortunetly, it's very hit or miss, either you love it, or you don't.\n\nYou take control of a Master (player character) and command and summon various Servants to take out the opposing side's Master Ghost. Controls can feel a bit weird at first, but once you get in the game you'll get used to it in no time.\n\nNow plotwise, this game reveals some great info on Sol, as well as introducing Sin, and is heavily referenced in GGXrd. The events of Overture set up the stage for the events of Xrd and Vastedge, A slot machine spinoff that takes place between Overture and Xrd. I won't give plot details away, but I will say that Overture is a very important chapter in the series, and you should definitelty play it to fully understand where the series is now.\n\nOverall, I love this game, it's weird, but it's fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TLG-X/recommended/437000/","TLG-X","Xx TLG xX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TLG-X/","54 products in account","UPDATED ON MAY 13\nNOTE: This review will be updated as more features get added to the game with updates.\n\nHonestly, I was truly shocked when I found out this game was released on steam without any news. Unlike other Guilty Gear games, this is not a fighting game. It's actually a 3rd person RTS game. I know you are wondering how this can be good but believe me, this game is so much fun and tactical when you get used to its mechanics.\nIn this game, you have to control a Master (your character) and summon Servants (troops) to take down the enemy's Master Ghost (base) while protecting your own master ghost. Summoning servants is done by entering the Organ menu mid-battle and spending Mana. There are various types of servants available (ranged, magic, etc…) and all of them are weak against some types of servants; so if you want to win, you have to pay attention to servant types. If you don't want to bother yourself with summoning servants or have trouble doing this in real time, you can activate Organ Assist and Organ Wait which summon servants automatically and stop time while in organ menu. You can also carry about 6 items with your master. The items can be found in chests in the maps or can be purchased from organ menu.\nThe controls are a bit wonky, especially when you have to run and drift around; but there's a high chance you get used to them. I wasn't comfortable with the controls at first but now I'm drifting around the maps without a problem.\n\nPROS:\n- Very fun to play. I never had this much fun for a long time.\n- Like always, SOUNDTRACKS ARE F###ING GREAT!\n- Great story (The story is Xrd's prequel. So if you want to know the full story, you must not miss this)\n- Runs at solid 60 FPS (Probably because it's originally a 2007 Xbox 360 game?)\n- Very nice support from the developers: A few days after people complained about the blurry graphics, they fixed it. (Thanks Shini!)\n\n\nCONS:\n- Ally AI in campaign mode: Seriously, WTF IS WRONG WITH ALL OF THE ALLY AI CONTROLLED CHARACTERS IN GAMES?! I was so close to controlling every ghost in the 8th mission of campaign two times and I got defeated in both of my tries because of an idiot named Dr.Paradigm who asks for help but instead of backing off, jumps right in middle of the combat!\n- Campaign's 13th mission: You will not be notified if an enemy is attacking the gate. So, you will play the mission and then suddenly see that half of the gate's life bar is gone thanks to the enemies that appear outta nowhere!\n- Item usage problems: I found this recently. If you get hit by an enemy during the process of using an item, the item won't be used (for example, Sol's Dragon Install won't activate) and goes immediately into the cooldown state. (This can sometimes remove the items from your inventory)\n- Not complete: Yeah, the game lacks many contents (for now). But if you trust in Arc System Works, you'll be sure they will add them to the game after some time.\n- No proper mouse and keyboard support (was going to be fixed in End-April update, but it got delayed to an unknown time. Keyboard keys can be changed by modifying a config file for now)\n- No graphical settings (going to be fixed after May. You can switch to full screen with Alt+Enter for now)\n\nNOTES:\n- Permanent buffs/debuffs are fixed now.\n- English voices are added now.","April 7","true","11.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033567549/recommended/437000/","76561198033567549","polsvoyce","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033567549/","94 products in account","A somewhat controversial title in the Guilty Gear lineage of 2D fighting games, Guilty Gear 2 Overture takes a radical departure as a MOBA+3D Fighting Game hybrid that debuted well before the MOBA genre hit its stride in popularity. Rather than being outdated, GG2 Overture still has plenty of unique offerings that set itself apart from the last decade's worth of Fighting Games and MOBAs on the market.\n\nThis game has two main components to consider when purchasing.\n\n1. Story Mode. Put together much like any traditional 2D/3D fighting game, assets are used from the Vs. portion of the game to construct set pieces and perhaps teach a bit of how the game operates. As far as Guilty Gear's story is concerned, this was a rather pivotal piece to the plot and is interesting if you're familiar with the GG lore. If you play other fighting games for their story, you'll probably know what to expect here. The Story Mode is essentially a primer getting the player prepared for taking their skills online in Vs. Mode, with some other flourishes thrown in for good measure. It's also worth sticking to, just to enjoy the last boss set piece, as it shows that Guilty Gear's scope can sometimes be larger than the confines of what can be done in merely a 2D one-on-one fighter.\n\n2. Vs. Mode. The actual attraction of this game, just like any MOBA or 2D/3D Fighting Game on the market. Like either of those genres, there's plenty of rules to learn if you're looking to get good at GG2 Overture. Movement options are complicated, but extremely deliberate. Every player controlled attack option has its application against both the other enemy Master (i.e. player controlled character), but also the servants that they command. Troop purchase and placement is intricately balanced, giving the player not only Master vs. Master matchups to understand, but how each of their servants will do against their opponent's troops as well. At high level play, this is arguably one of the most heated, intense, and competitive games out there. Considering some matches can run nearly 30 minutes in length, you'll very much care if you win or lose, every single time you play.\n\nOne could make the analogy that Master combat in this game is something like Soul Calibur (or for those especially uninformed, Dynasty Warriors), but I find it closer to something like "Virtual On". Like that title, your special moves and attacks in GG2 Overture are both long range projectiles, but also close-range melee options utilizing three dimensional space better than Soul Calibur has ever tried. The strategy elements of this game are of the rock-paper-scissors-shotgun-Spock variety in that there's a lot to keep in mind when sending your battalion against your enemy. What's particularly fun and rewarding in this game is marching your cherry-picked squad of troops forward into a huge skirmish against the enemy team, but also arriving as your player character and personally helping to turn that tide. The victory of one huge fight like that can cost the entire match - so there's always something riding on every fight. Oh, and strangely enough, there's a dash of Mario Kart thrown into the mix here too, no joke. Each Master when running, essentially handles like their own different 'vehicle' with differences in run speeds, acceleration, and drifting per character.\n\nRegarding characters, there's also a lot of thought to be placed into character selection. Some Masters are more mobile, some better suited for Vs. combat, and others excel in the strength of their army. Finding the right character for you can make a big difference in your enjoyment of this game.\n\nUnfortunately there's a limit to how much Story Mode can actually teach. Much like the Fighting Game world, the tutorial resources available in-game are slim. The previous publisher Aksys seems to have had a difficult time promoting this game on the Xbox 360 nearly 9 years ago, and additionally had difficulty figuring out how to readily teach this game to the masses. Youtube would generally be a good start for anyone looking to learn this game's incredibly deep fighting and strategy systems, but the documentation for this game won't be quite as prolific as say, Street Fighter 5 or League of Legends. Why not just go play one of those games instead? Well, because this game offers something unique that has actually never been replicated in the videogame world again in 9 years - It's fundamentally both of those games put together.\n\nIn summation, GG2 Overture is an exhilarating game for those willing to learn the nuances of its combat and strategy systems. Like other competitive games out there, your enjoyment will largely be based on what you put into it.\n\n---\n\nP.S.  Regarding youtube vids: a silly, but generally true rule of thumb. If the player doesn't look like they're juggling a hundred things at once and flipping through menus quicker than you can read, they're not playing the game at High Level. Time and speed are incredibly important in this game. Good luck!","April 4","true","7.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/437000/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Do you have to be a hardcore anime fan to get into the game? Most likely. If you're a casual gamer is it possible to get into it? Yes, as the concept may entice you or may confuse you.\n\nGuilty Gear 2 -Overture- follows other anime concepts with some insane 3D attack combinations and visuals to go along with it. This is the bread and butter of the game play. I'm not completely familiar with the guilty gear series but I'll try to give you the best low-down I can. You play as a character (mainly) named Sol who is a Gear. Gears apparently have abilities to use magic as they were formed from smaller molecular magical parts. The rising action begins when "sleeping" Gears begin vanishing from a Kingdom and therefore attempts to reach out to Sol as he's under attack by a mysterious foe. This foe later turns out to be some weird girls wearing some questionable clothing.\n\nGuilty Gear follows mainly an over the shoulder 3rd person camera of Sol. Sol is able to attack whomever he pleases and can move around the map freely. His basic attack is X but can be mixed in with other combinations (such as pointing the left stick up/down/left/right) to add different effects. Magic attacks can be thrown into the mix by using >>>>>Y<<<<<< but a certain amount of mana is needed before you can let loose and go nuts. Sol also has the ability to dash (pressing A twice) and can jump (by pressing A). He is capable of sprinting at a variable speed depending on how much you crank the left thumb stick. Sprinting is a bit difficult as turning can prove to be a challenge. This is neither good nor bad as it just takes a bit of time getting used to. Sol can literally "drift" while he is running to make sharp turns.\n\nThe main premise of the game is essentially an over the shoulder fight game with mixed elements of strategy. I've done some research on reviews and found a vast mix of opinions. Some like the layout this particular game took as it didn't follow the traditional GG setup. Some didn't like it as they couldn't quite figure out if the game was this or if the game was that (I'm going to judge the game as I see it). To me, it seems that they've taken a tower defense game and added an attack option. This attack option largely consists of you controlling Sol in order to take out the opponents "Masterghost" (or the main structure that will lead to your victory). Smaller structures can be taken over to collect additional mana and create additional units. Sol may hit these structures in an attempt to take them over quicker. By default, each tower spawns units. These units don't really attack one another but seem to count for 1 hit point each. If your unit collides with another enemy unit, chances are they will cancel one another out (unless a unit has been upgraded). Unfortunately, the player does not have control over these upgrades and is done automatically. A missed opportunity; they could have given the player more directive by giving them control over this. Sol can sort of control his own "robot" specialty units (each character have their specific set of specialty units). He can "pack" them into his inventory and release them where he pleases on the map.\n\nThe inventory can be accessed by simply pressing "B" to activate the selected inventory. This can range from units, to specialty objects (used against bosses) and other miscellaneous power ups. The player can swap between inventory by pressing RB or LB. 6 slots are available and power ups can be found all around the map randomly. The game play itself is good at first, but can slowly start getting redundant to some player. I can see the animations that are associated with the attacks attracting players back to the game but I can see a lot of players walking the other way after completing a few missions. Either way, the game does have a solid story line to it if players are willing to watch the cut-scenes.\n\nThe visuals in the game are of xbox 360 quality and could have been upgraded for the PC port. The graphics themselves are not too bad and the background scenery is pretty good. Most of the animations are full and have a lot of effects. They definitely tried their best in including all sorts of creatively designed characters and enemies. The sounds are actually really authentic. They kept the entire game in Japanese (with English subtitles) which I think is great. I have no idea what they are saying but sounds cool. I'm sure players will enjoy the voice acting. The actual battle sounds are good but I can see some players becoming agitated from hearing the same dialogue (in-game) or impact sounds.\n\nOverall, it's neither a good game nor bad game. I think it's something that someone can relate and become interested in the story which leads to playing the game. The game play itself is pretty cool and the concept they tried makes the game a unique one at that. The only game I think comes close to this concept is Sacrifice but you can't really attack physically with your character. I will recommend this game but with great caution.

Reviewing the basic game itself, I can happily recommend it. Easily one of the most underrated exclusives that ever graced the 360. It earned bad-to-mediocre reviews back then, but I think that was mainly because people either didn't quite understand what the game was supposed to be, or they were old Guilty Gear fans who were disappointed that they'd been given a stylish action/real-time strategy hybrid instead of another sidescrolling fighter. I think if people give it another look nowadays, they'll be able to appreciate it more as the wildly original, solidly-made actioner that it really is. Possibly even more so by having it on Steam, where the community is more open to these kinds of experimental sidesteps.\nAnd man oh man, dat soundtrack. Some of my favorite tracks from the entire Guilty Gear franchise, and this series is full of some of the best metal-based music in gaming.\n\nAll of that being said, It has to be mentioned that at the time of this posting, there are absolutely no graphics options to adjust, which is extremely disappointing. The game runs in a windowed 720p format which can't be altered in any way. Honestly, what's the point of even porting a game to PC if you can't pretty it up using the superior power of one's gaming rig? I was expecting that I'd be able to up the resolution, maybe improve the textures and all that... but as it is now, the port provides absolutely no way to do this.\nHopefully some kind of patch is applied at a later date, providing extra options to make the most of playing it on PC. Otherwise... you may as well just go play the 360 version.\n\nSo as a game, it's great, and I do recommend it. But as a PC port of an almost decade-old game, it could really use a bit of patching on the part of the devs.\nOh, and you can't invert the look controls. Just another thing to mention. An option for it is present, but it can't be changed. Kind of odd.","April 1","true","0.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Its totally different from regular fighting series of Guilty Gear but it contains crucial story connections and offline play pays off for those who dont like strategys (you can check "organ assist" for singleplayer, which makes this game MOBA).\n\nRight now, game is in "development" state... its far from original (X360) in quality, please: dont judge it by graphic for now.\n","April 2","true","26.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Unfortunately, not even that could get me to enjoy Guilty Gear's venture into the genre.  Which is a shame because I tried really hard to like it.  This game borrows a few things from DOTA, but the fact that you can build and command units sets it into Action-RTS hybrid territory.\n\nMAPS: This games takes the map design from DOTA a little too literally, translating poorly for an action game.  You get the same 3 to 4 tight corridors for you and your units to march in.  But you, as a hero unit, need to be able to move much more quickly, so there is a dash mechanic in which you "anime ninja dash" through these tight quarters.  If you bump into an enemy, or hit a wall, you crash, and crash hard.  It makes something as simple as changing lanes a nightmare.  This is the reason I dislike the game more than anything else.\n\nUnits: You can build units with Rock Paper Scissors properties.  A lot of them have really cool designs and they communicate with you when they encounter enemies, and let you know if they have an advantage or not.  Other than that, they trade hits with each other like Dynasty Warriors, and its your job to support them.  Unlike DOTA "creeps" are helpless units with 1HP that cancel each other out and only exist to capture Ghosts (resource nodes.)  Its boring, but non-intrusive and effective.  In order to command them, you have to go to an entirely different screen called The Organ, where you can build and command units.  This means you have to leave to a safe area before you can issue commands.  Its clunky and frustrating.\n\nMusic: I only bought the game for the soundtrack.  Daisuke Ishiwatari once again put away the drum machine and got a live drummer for the character tracks.  However, you won't hear most of it in the game.  Generic synth orchestras play through most of the story, one "encounter" song for when hero units clash, and a handful of metal songs to go with some important moments.  Do yourself a favor and actually listen to the attached OST, and hear what you’re missing!\n\nHero Units: The game leans a bit too far into Dynasty Warriors.  Each hero unit can pull off some long, absurd wombo-combos, and characters from the fighting games have their moves retained.  But these can be time consuming, to the point of being tiresome.  They pull your eyes away from the overall battlefield and unit status.  To traverse long distances, you can "anime ninja dash" through the area, but like I said in Maps, its easily the worst part of the game.\n\nStory: I enjoy the story very much.  And if you like Guilty Gear's story and setting, this is the game that FINALLY pulled the story out of the quagmire that GGX2 set.  GGX2 was so done to death that it can be summarized of every character telling every other character "get out of my way."  GG2 takes places a few years after GGX2.  The world is running out of meaningful bounties to hunt, as Gears go extinct (or so the world thinks), so bye-bye Bridget and Jam (finally!)  Ky goes through some big changes, and steps aside for a new main character, Sin.  Gears replace bounty hunters as the focus of the story, revealing they have their own communities and beliefs toward the world.  And the source of Magic in the world of GG is revealed.  Sol's nemesis, That Man, reveals hints at Sol's destiny, and a new tragic villain, the first Valentine, is revealed. And there is one EPIC finally battle in which Sol finally rises up and shows us why he is the main character of the story.   Its enough, at this price, to justify a single playthrough.\n\nI think that the developers, like most who want to venture into the cursed, obscure Action RTS genre, thought they were the first to come up with an Action RTS hybrid, and not look at the graveyard of such games that it left behind.  Battlezone and Sacrifice were wonderful games that nobody bought.  Instead we have this mess of a game that can't compete.  If you want to play one of the best Action RTS games from this era, play Brutal Legend instead.  It resolves every major problem I have with GG2.","April 3","false","0.2"," 14 of 41 people (34%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","34","14","41","2","2"
