You quickly get use to the greyscale art style, where some colour is only added to help attract your attention to certain objects and places.\nEven in some cases the colour can be rather subtle, like a hint of soft yellow in a sea of grey.\n\nThe story isn't bad either, although some of the dialogue can be rather cringey at times. This is mostly due to the fact that it's a Noir game set in the 1930's.\n\nThe main issues are the checkpoint system, and the character movement mechanics; and that it seems to have been designed for iOS and tablets first. As a result you need to do everything with a single mouse click. You move with a click, you stop, you open doors, select items, and change characters that way.\n\nThere are no real options either.\n\nSome parts of the game can easily take 30+ minutes and accidentally dying or being spotted because of the slow character movement and clunky system is horrible. As the checkpoint saves can mean you're suddenly set back that 30+ minutes.\nIt's extremely annoying, as the characters can't make turns or go up and down stairs rather well. They walk, stop, turn, stop, then move. In that time the guards would easily have spotted you and shot you. They are rather trigger happy, as they shoot the second they see someone.\n\nIf you can get by the controls and checkpoints the game is rather enjoyable. Especially if you like stealth Noir games. It's rather fun.\n\nI only wish I could choose a third option for the review though, such as MAYBE. The issues either make or break the game for many and I hope the little PC Gameplay footage below can help folks decide.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dlK2JnE0o8","August 27, 2015","true","2.8"," 34 of 50 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","34","50","5","5"

It was like playing through an actual movie, with a fantastic voice over reading out the narrative, making it more immersive.\n\nI also enjoyed the characters, a lot of them were very charming and likable.\n\nWilt is the main character of the story; a war deserter who makes his living as a thief-for-hire, the exact opposite of the typical detective noir protagonist. It was an interesting change of pace. One stormy night, Wilt is contacted by a mysterious young woman, Siska, who offers him what seems to be a regular, run-of-the-mill job. Or is it??\nAlong the way, Wilt comes across various characters, each with his/her own motives, some will join his quest for the truth - while others will try to get in his way...\n\nThe voice work also made them feel more natural. My only disappointment about them was that Wilt's backstory felt unfinished. And I feel as though I didn't play with Arno (an old friend of Wilt's from the war) as much as I could have; I liked him, but I felt as though he was an unecessary character given his limited skills.\n\nThe story was nice, but I feel that the ending was rather unfitting and anti-climatic; there was a really good build up for the ending and it really did feel like it just backslided into the mud. But, then again, I chose the 'neutral' ending, there are still two others that I need to try getting - maybe there is a more fitting one.\n\nThe game itself was rather addictive; there were a lot of rooms I wanted to explore and I found the aspect of sneaking around very tantalizing. But, a couple of the puzzles were a bit fussy, some were also buggy, but I managed to get past them so they were easy to overlook. The only real complaint I have is the check point system: In a single level, there are about two or three check points in set locations that are activated once you and your teammates are gathered around it; I really wish there was a manual save system, but I suppose it adds to the challenge.\n\nPersonally, my experience has been enjoyable and I can see the replay value; there's still a lot to explore, there are other dialogue options and there are other endings to experience.\n\nIf you enjoy the noir genre and stealth mechanics in games such as Dishonored, for example (it's a far cry, I know, but I've played both games and the stealth mechanics felt both punishing and rewarding at the same time), you might like to give Calvino Noir a try. Granted, the price is a bit steep, so, I recommend waiting for a sale before buying.","September 26, 2015","true","14.9"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/316890/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","This review was written for FREEDOM Community Gaming Collective[freedomcgc.com].\nSometimes I think there is no better setting to tell a story than a rainy night. I start the game up and the stage is set perfectly. I guide a shadowy figure in a coat while his tie dances in the wind. The striking black and white aesthetic of 1930s Vienna in the background coupled with the jazzy soundtrack instantly sets the mood. The Narrator sounds off in his suave British accent and a cynical, hopeless tone: “There are those who eventually flee, and there are those who learn to exist here”. Calvino Noir is so noir, it’s absolutely drenched in it. And the rain does not let up.\n\nThere are games that make terrible first impressions, but then they sort of draw you in and show you that there is more to them than meets the eye. Unfortunately, Calvino Noir is the opposite, it shows off all of its good sides within the first few minutes. It’s all downhill from there. I am instructed to answer the phone on the top floor of the building. I get to the stairs and I don’t know how to go up. After a few seconds, I discover that, for some reason, Calvino Noir wants to defy established 2D game design conventions in favor of an unnecessarily convoluted control scheme. There is a white marker on screen that you have to guide up or down the stairs and your character will follow it. Of course, when you’re in hurry because you’re fleeing from an enemy or your input isn’t pitch perfect, your character will simply go where you don’t want him to go. I thought a reason for such a design decision would reveal itself later on, but there isn’t one. It’s there just to make the control scheme cumbersome.\n\nWhen I talk to my contact, Saska, I’m met with another annoyance. The Narrator’s introductory voice acting was pretty good as is Wilt’s (the main playable character). However, Saska’s accent of indeterminate origin is just terrible. And it’s not just the accent, the delivery is robotic and awful. She points me in the direction of a local mole whose grating German (or Austrian, if you will) accent is so over the top that it comes off as an unintentional parody. From there on out, it’s just a series of horrible voice acting. After a while, the writing gets tiresome as well. Calvino Noir isn’t just inspired by noir, it wants to be noir to such a degree that it exposes itself as a clumsy and ungraceful wannabe instead of a classy hommage.\n\nAt its heart, Calvino Noir is a stealth game. You explore your surroundings, sneak around in shadows, and try not to get shot by guards. One of the major problems with Calvino Noir is that it simply does not explain anything. There is no tutorial, certain indicators appear on the screen and you have no idea what they are. As I have already mentioned, even basics such as the control scheme are simply left for you to fiddle around with and figure out yourself. It is so crucial that stealth games have a clear and intuitive interface, perhaps more important that for any other genre. Those that fail will cause bewilderment and frustration. For example, every playable character is equipped with a flashlight. No use for it was apparent to me so I didn’t use it because I didn’t want to alert the guards to my presence. It was near the end of the game that I accidentally found out that the sole purpose of the flashlight is to illuminate coins on the ground, which you can use to upgrade your speed and stealth. The upgrade system itself is so basic and pointless that I didn’t even need it so it wasn’t much of a loss, but it’s just unbelievable that you can almost get through the entire game without having such basic information.\n\nEach playable character has a unique ability. Wilt can take out guards, Saska can look through keyholes and pick locks, whereas Arno can operate machinery. All of these elements are extremely basic. All you need to do as Wilt is to just sneak up to a guard and press a button. Even if he sees you when you get close, it doesn’t really matter much because it takes a while for him to get his gun out and shoot you. Random passersby don’t react to you chocking a guy in the middle of the street or in a crowded metro station. Likewise, you press a button while playing as Saska and the door is unlocked. Arno’s ability is used in puzzles so it’s just a bit more involving. Still, the puzzle design is rudimentary and mostly revolves around picking something up with a crane and lowering it in another spot. There is also an extremely annoying elevator puzzle near the end which tasks you with distributing weights. The problem is that there are no visual indicators regarding their placement, making it very easy to forget where you put the weights. This results in mindlessly walking around and clicking randomly hoping that you’ll accidentally solve the puzzle.\n\nThe actual stealth is as basic as everything else in the game and not particularly well designed. You simply observe patrol patterns and either navigate around them as Saska or take the guards out as Wilt. You can take advantage of hiding spots, but hiding is so slow and clunky that I only did it when I absolutely needed to. Most of the time, multiple playable characters will be present in the level and they all need to be at certain points of interest and at the end of the level, which basically means that you have to traverse the same area multiple times in order to guide each character to the designated spot. I have absolutely no idea what was the reasoning behind this design decision. There is a button that you can hold to make the other characters follow you, but this actually rarely works. After just a little bit, they simply stop, especially near doors. The game is relatively short, you will be able to finish all of its seven levels in about 5 hours. There are no new elements or setpieces introduced over the course of the game. If you’ve seen the first level, you have pretty much seen it all.\n\nCalvino Noir’s impressive presentation is not nearly enough to serve as its saving grace. This is a game that is severely lacking in design, the controls are shoddy, the interface is a mess, the voice acting is annoying, the characters and the story are forgettable. Not even the rain can wash these problems away.\n\n3 OUT OF 10 (POOR)","September 24, 2015","false","4.3"," 51 of 81 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","51","81","5","0"

You may be interested in this. CHECK OUT SOME GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE beforehand though! Also wait til it's on sale. If you're a fan of moody Noir era / Detective stuff you'll probably enjoy what this has to offer thematically. The writing is definitely the highlight of the game, with seemingly simple but very challenging gameplay. It reminds me of an old NES game where you would also sluggishly hide behind dark corners, but I can't remember the title of that game... *shrug*\n\nI advise waiting until it's on sale, I picked it up for around 10 and think it's worth that value, kinda priced a little high as far as some of the clumsy mechanics go. Some very atmospheric moments which the designer (s? it may be all a solo work) deserve credit for.\n\nIf you're willing to die (A LOT) and have the patience for a trial and error, simple interfaced game with moody environments and great writing, and definitely if you're a fan of Noir content, it touches on the genre's themes in a unique way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/316890/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","A noir type of stealth game released initially for the smartphones, Calvino Noir tells a story altogether in 7 chapters (divided up into 3 acts). We assume the control of several individuals, each with a different "ability": Wilt can take down enemies by choking them, Siska is an expert at unlocking doors while Arno is the only one who can operate the machinery found in factories and other places. Oh, and The Mole is someone who can get past any guard since he is considered to be one of them.\n\nThe premise is very interesting: they set out to uncover the secret of a distillery after stealing some vital documents. Of course, as it is normal in such stories, there's a conspiracy in the background and almost everybody amongst the fat cats of the town is involved. We get to find out about the background of some of the characters as they regularly converse throughout the levels (we can call these cutscenes).\n\nNow, essentially, the game is about getting from point A to point B while enemy guards represent obstacles on each level. Wilt and his gang can run but this generates louder noises. They can use their flashlight but guards can easily notice them if they get to a certain distance. Technically, flashlights are not necessary (the game is not that dark), however, coins are hidden on each level (20 pieces) and only with the use of our torch can we spot them. This is quite the challenge: 1 or 2 can easily remain at the end of each level - thank god the game saves our progress on each stage.\n\nThe game looks very nice and while it is mainly presented in black and white it can provide you with an enjoyable atmosphere. I especially liked the big halls or wide streets where the background was still visible in the far distance. I also liked how our flashlight makes certain objects cast their shadows. I wish there was a zoom option to be able to see how detailed the character models are.\n\nAnd here comes the bad stuff: while the guards react to their fellow colleagues being choked by an unknown intruder they try to locate us (as the source of sound) while being completely disinterested in seeing a couple of dead bodies in a room. They do not really search and once they surveyed the spot in question for a couple of seconds they return to their duties. Because of this the levels where Wilt can be controlled do not really offer a challenge. Still, we get to be shot down due to the clunky controls and the awful hiding mechanism: hiding is possible behind certain objects but the characters do it rather slowly.\n\nThen, of course, we cannot get away from the fact that this is a mobile game port: the main menu has barely any options for settings and the font is huge - they could have just reworked this with the inclusion of some extra graphics options but they did not.\n\nIn conclusion, Calvino Noir manages to be a good stealth-based side-scroller game with an excellent noir atmosphere. At the time of writing this review (May 7th) this is 85% off which is an instant grab for those who like the genre.","May 7","true","6.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It has little replay value imo.\n\nIt can be frustrating at times, but is a very nice game that I hope they make a sequel and improve a bit since it has even more potential.

Calvino Noir captures that staple in every way, from the raining, use of shadows, mystery, and of course, our beleaguered hero. The entire game drips with style and crime. The gameplay portions are a mixture of stealth and action, you sneak around guards reaching objectives using three different characters with their own specialties. Certain characters can knock out guards, pick locks, etc. For the most part the gameplay aspects are fine and fairly straight forward with very little bugs to speak of. Where the game does shine is in tone and atmosphere. Musically it's fantastic and fits within the themes as well, creating a dreary and mysterious mood. The voice acting is charmingly cheesy at times but fun and sounds great. The only problem I can find is the price and nature of the UI/options. This game is an App that was ported to PC. certain dialogue even says to tap on areas of the screen. There is no options whatsoever except that there is controller support and the game natively snaps to your resolution. This isn't a big deal IF this were a tad bit cheaper. The game is available on other markets for far less and is exactly the same experience. You're essentially purchasing the luxury of playing this on PC and Steam Achievemetns/cards. While some may find that perfectly fine and acceptable. I like to see a little bit more for my buck. To sum, Calvino Noir is a great game but the price tag is slightly padded for what you get. I recommend this if you LOVE Noir style games. Otherwise check out the App version.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/mBp_8JmB-m8\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","August 29, 2015","true","1.7"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","19","29","2","2"

Some spots of the game are frustrating to move through because it won't recognize your mouse clicks. There were even some parts of the game where guards would see my entirely through doors.

On top of these, Calvino Noir adds quite a decent bit of noir aesthetics. Voice acting is also quite good - no cringing sensation of a bad English accent or a worse German one (unlike horrors of, say, Blizzard VAs).\n\nAs the name half-suggests, there is a profusion of noir themes of solitary private eye(-ish) protagonist, constant rainfall and muted colour palette. Not sure where `Calvino` comes into play - possibly referring to the Italian author of the same name for some reference or other.\n\nThe game consists of seven levels, divided into three acts (3/2/2) and the player controls (eventually) three characters: Whit, a English `scrambler`, (whose special ability is to choke enemies), Arno (who can operate machines) and Siska (picks locks and spies through keyholes). Each character possesses some common abilities, such as handtorches, which enables the player to collect hidden piles of coins that are used to upgrade character abilities.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit of mixed bag - while straightforward in its layout and mission structure, the controls are not particularly comfortable. Abilties are keybound on Q (toggle walk/run), W (torch), E (Swap character) and they are the only keyboard-related input in the game. Navigation and interactions are bound to the mouse and this occasionally result in some difficulties like skipping cover zones while being pursuit (as the game uses checkpoints rather than saves, it might get frustrating at times). It may be different and perhaps better on a PS4, though.\n\nA minor issue is the lack of tooltips on certain parts of the game - character upgrades, for instance, feature two abilities and although it isn`t too hard to work out what they do, it wouldn`t be too difficult to put a tooltip anyway.\n\nOverall, it appears to be a decent, albeit perhaps a bit of niche title. Aesthetically (visual and audial) it stands out far ahead. In terms of gameplay, the aforementioned clunkiness may deter some, but in the long run these can probably be improved via devs, or simply be overcome by players.\n\n","May 3","true","1.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game is very calm and all the controls are to be used in the display by clicking them with the mouse, which looks strange and a bit impractical in the first minutes but which will result in something that you will get very familiar with after a bit.\n\nThe best part of the production are the voices, very deep and well recorded, which will calm you down in every situation, very relaxing to hear.\n\nThe Background music are very well thought and they are typical noir musics, interesting to hear, but when you will die again and again trying to pass trough the guards and you will be forced to listen to them on and on they will become a little but annoying.\n\nThe guards are the only bad part of the game, very hard to get rid of them and very good guards, the level of difficulty will surely require your efforts those guardians, which are maybe a little but too much and a little bit too good at catching us.\n\nThe style of the game is lovable, the graphics and the atmosphere are really attractive and if you would like to immerse yourself into a noir movie then let's get into this, you won't regret it.\n\nVideogame News, Indie Score: 7.7 | RECOMMENDED\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYy_4NI3T8Q","August 31, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

With the help of friends, he does all he can to prevent the worst scenario to happen.\nDoes this sound cliched and convoluted? Yes. But the story is actually way easier to understand in-game, and it works very well for what it is supposed to do: the dialogue is noir and overly serious, the story is pathetic and everyone feels the weight of the world on their shoulders. But, as a big fan of noir movies and games, I love this type of stories. If you like the genre, there's much to like in the story department.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game adopts the art-style made famous by Limbo: grey background with shadowy figures in the foreground. And it suits the tone of the game. The levels that you explore are big, with realistic architecture and believable level design, as well as having nice animations for the characters.\n\nGAMEPLAYBeing a fan of stealth games, I probably had my hopes up a lot when starting this game: depending on the level, you control from one to three characters by using your mouse only (similarly to This War of Mine), and each one has a different ability (lockpick, knock-out guards, operate machinery). While this may sound interesting and might open up multiple possibilities, the game is just too linear, with the only real choice being to knock-out or not some guards.\nDon't get me wrong, the gameplay has great concepts, but the execution is just too linear and repetitive in the long run that you just stop enjoying the otherwise well-crafted experience. There is also a bug (that the developers might have fixed by now) that sometimes alerts guards when you are sneaking behind them, forcing you to sprint towards them to beat them. The gameplay is very disappointing.\n\nCHALLENGEBecause of its linear nature, the game quickly becomes more about trial'n'error rather than strategy. The enemy A.I., while impressive at first because of their patrolling and checking of sounds and shadowy figures, becomes rather predictable making some of the later levels in the game easier to complete.\n\nSOUNDI love me a good jazz soundtrack, and this one doesn't disappoint: while it isn't as memorable as Gunpoint's or Grim Fandango's, it is pretty good and fits the atmosphere that the game creates. The same goes for the overly-serious voice acting made famous in late 40s noir movies, that I simply love.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThe 7 levels of the game don't offer multiple paths to some objectives, and the only collectibles are coins (that can be used to meaninglessly upgrade your character) and shrouds. The Steam achievements are mostly story and collectibles related, and coming back doesn't feel rewarding.\n\nOverall, only fans of noir movies will enjoy the game because of its cliched story, dialogues and locations, otherwise you will spend most of the time complaining of the poor gameplay mechanics, its repetitive nature and other wasted possibilities.\n\nStory: 8\nGraphics: 9\nGameplay: 6.5\nChallenge: 5\nSound: 9\nReplayability: 5\n\nENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 7.5\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","August 28, 2015","true","4.9"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","14","28","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Schnappi07/recommended/316890/","Schnappi07","Schnappi07","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Schnappi07/","289 products in account","The moody black and white thriller is inspired by film noir, based on exploratory and sneaking through dark and post-World War I Vienna during 1930’s.\n\nYou are taking control of four different characters during game where main character is supposed to be Wilt, written with dark poetic monologues filled with hate against city along with everyone else. Story is starting out of the sky with a single phone call where mistery lady is asking for a man with particular set of skills where Wilt jumps in with his espionage and blackmail knowledge looking for money and nothing else. As in movies, an easy mission turns into conspiracy filled with twists and turns where innocent Wilt is drawn by accident.\n\nNow there is a slight disparity between 2D platformers and these kind of games settled in this ambient so overall immersion is lost since begining, though dark and mistery story followed by events and reveals of new characters keeps you occupied.\n\nThrough game you will discover new people and their backside stories where further into game you can make choices suited to those or only for your desire, outcome will not change but getting more info and a bit more of story behind is always interesting. Fact that your main plot character Wilt will literally dissapear after couple chapters due to slight disagreement with mystery lady “Siska” is making whole situation a bit more confusing where you can clearly feel gaping hole during progress.\n\nSiska, young but determined lady to destroy corruption and underground criminal along with Arno, old military Wilt life-friend even though they meet in unpropriate situation comes with unique skills which will help you to make progress and get unnoticed from guards and usually only guards. As I mentioned Wilt will dissapear from game for a while so knocking out enemies is not a option anymore although eventually we get into control of moll from that same underground criminal organization which will be helpful since we can move through world without being noticed, with him ofcourse while rest of crew need to follow on their own stealth way.\n\nBad side comes up with frustrating feeling after dying every time along with incosistent AI where sometimes you can get killed by one shot on sight or you can simply sprint through guards despite you being noticed. Checkpoints in some bigger levels are rather few and far in between while some of mechanics doesnt work smooth as they should and it will depend on RNG factors will you succeed or not. Wilt and his knockdowns will need to be perfectly accurate in terms of when you sprint to get faster to guard since getting closer even from behind doesnt make your knockdown faster along with fact that characters will often get stuck on ladders or unexpected places. You cant go over feeling that simply this genre with this kind of gameplay is not made for stealth game and yet every new chapter will delivere nothing more then already seen.\n\nConcept art on the other hand is more then amazing, always rainy and dark Vienna with many buildings and structures including small indoor objects deliver what they are supposed to do. Dialoguess and monologues are sometimes poetic yet still original with different accents where you can feel how natural conversation would be, well aside from repetetive sentences when you try to direct them.\n\nControls on PC are rather simple and they are making click and point genre from this title despite developer claiming that this is not that and its recommended to be played with controller. Problem occurs with fact that you need to control 3 different characters most of the time concurrently and that can be done only with mouse since you have enough time to choose second one while you direct your primary character at the end of the screen. There’s a lot of backtracking which makes you play same area even 3 times with really slow moving around fairly large facilities. Some of you will probably overlook these cons due to interesting and intriguing story but only if you are prepared for what is waiting you.\n\nIn my eyes it feels like that despite amazing concept art and dark noir style there are holes in gameplay and mechanics including really slow controls. If you like slow paced 2D adventures without any action whatsoever and almost repetetive levels with a bit of fresh acknowledgement after every, this might be good game for you but intentions, idea and execution are definitely not on same level.\n\nGameplay 6\nArt Style 8\nStory 6\nDialogues 6\nMechanics 5\nOverall: 6.2\n","August 27, 2015","true","2.8"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","1"

A bit cliche at times, but the story by itself did hook me in, even if the characters themselves were a bit drab.\n\nThe problems I had was with gameplay. Two things specifically. One was how the enemy guards worked. More than once, I died and had to start over again because a trigger-happy guard caught a glimpse of me from across the room and took me out immediately. The checkpoint system was frustrating becausw whenever I died, I wound up having to start over a long way from where I was. The hiding mechanic where your character hides behind nearby cover is very slow, it's hard to figure out where hiding palces are, and didn't work a lot of the time.\n\nThe other was the buggy controls. It was hard for me to get my characters to do what I wanted them do: for example, I might tell my character to move close to the door and prepare for a takedown, but instead they open the door and get shot in the face.\n\nProbably the biggest problem I had with it was that the game doesn't explain anything: there's not much by way of a tutorial, so you're forced to learn through trial and error, which means that you die a lot of the time, rather than using a strategy to win. It also frustrates me that you have to juggle three people at the same time, whcih just makes it that much easier for a mission to go wrong because you forgot about one guy. Plus, there's only one player who can actually fight, which makes the other two seem totally helpless, unable to fight back if they get seen.\n\nI had really high hopes for this game, and if the developers had put some more effort into this, it probably could have been better. As it is, I feel like I got ripped off for $25 just to get killed over and over again.","October 17, 2015","false","2.0"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","2"
