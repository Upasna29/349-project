"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/252830/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3602 products in account","Claire is a 2D psychological survival-horror game that pulls a lot of inspiration from Silent Hill, Clock Tower, and a few other horror games of the early 2000s. I had been following the title since mid-2013, and finally gave it a play after a few patches had been delivered for the game post-release (which to the developers credit, they have been very active in responding to problems the game has via patches and being active on their steam community forums and twitter). I had played about an hour of the game last February off Desura, which was very rough at the time. I wasn't quite sure what the final product was going to end up like.\n\nClaire stars the titular character as she wakes up from a nightmare about her childhood. She is in the hospital taking care of her mother, who is sickly and bedridden. However, as she fetches coffee to keep herself awake, the hospital suddenly changes... Shifts into some form of nightmare realm. Quickly finding aid from a dog known as Anubis, they go to try and find an escape to the twisted terror they've found themselves trapped in.\n\nIn Claire, you explore labyrinth-like locations full of enemies, traps, puzzles, scares, and atmosphere as you open locked doors and trigger events that advance the story. Honestly its all rather simple. Occasionally you meet a person in the labyrinth you can help with something via a side-quest, or some choice you can make or optional puzzle you can partake in. Your actions go towards what ending you'll get at game's end, of which there are six of.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, but is supported by good design, an actually helpful map (surprising as I find maps are usually useless in 2D horror games like this), fantastic atmosphere, and a number of surreal and interesting moments throughout, backed by a good lighting engine and moody sound design.\n\nMonsters come in a few varieties, but none can be killed, simply ran from and hid from. And they can be determined buggers in hunting you down, bashing down doors you try to escape through, and can follow you into any room outside of save rooms. You either have to outrun them, outsmart them (like blocking a door), out-climb them (they can't climb things it seems), or hide in a closet/similar hiding place. Though some monsters don't chase you at all. One common threat is a type of monster that won't chase you, but getting near it will drain your 'sanity'.\n\nSanity isn't for insane effects or anything, but survival in Claire. Like Clock Tower's panic feature, basically. The more loss of 'calm' and scared you become, the more you'll start taking damage, until you're panicking and taking damage for simply panicking. A big part of the game, especially later in, is managing your health and sanity and playing wisely. This is helped by the fact that like Resident Evil, the stages are large with multiple paths, allowing you to make strategic paths through the facility once you've come more familiar with its layout.\n\nNormally I build-up to my impressions of a review by talking about the elements, but to explain Claire I need to work backwards... I loved it. It's going up there as what I would list as the best 2D horror games out there, along with the likes of Lone Survivor, Clock Tower, Yume Nikki, Last Door, Ib, Witch's House, etc. Claire succeeds in making an unnerving atmosphere that actually managed to spook me on a few occasions, interesting moments in both gameplay, design, and narrative, and wrapping it all together into an enjoyable horror game package.\n\nAnd its with this severe love I have for the game I must mention that the game still has some problems. The developers are responding to them and still patching the game, but I need to make note of this as the time I played it (version 1.145) that I ran into a number of issues. I played the game kind of stupidly on Nightmare difficulty (the hardest difficulty) on my first playthrough of the game, and as a mention I would not suggest playing on this difficulty unless you really want a challenge and have some patience. But maybe because of this I experienced more problems, as most of what I had problems with was the sanity system, which was very unforgiving and has weird problems like certain cutscene spots draining my sanity so fast I would die during cutscenes and would actively have to heal myself to keep myself alive to read the dialogue in cutscenes. And then some minor things, like how I found the flashlight not really useful most of the time and just defaulted to the lighter, or a few areas later in the game feeling a bit too much like trial-and-error in parts.\n\nI'm sure most of my problems will be addressed with future patches again, and don't think this game is worth passing up on for this.\n\nClaire feels a bit similar to some other kinds of horror games, with the easiest comparison to make being Lone Survivor (they share a bit more in common than just being 2D games with some Silent Hill influence, though let it be known if you liked Lone Survivor, you will most likely enjoy this). However, it also manages to create its own feel and tale of horror, and the developments in both gameplay and story for the most part feel satisfying.\n\nIt's a bit slow, there are a few places where navigating and where you're supposed to go can be a bit confusing. However, the levels have a fun exploration element and will usually reward you for taking time off the beaten path, with a variety of side-quest, goodies, hidden scenes and scares, and more.\n\nSpeaking of which, the game manages to pack some good scares and "WTF" moments through its course. I found myself a bit more comfortable and less on-edge after the first area, but the game managed to put me on edge and make me feel uneasy through the beginning first hour or two, and had its moments throughout its course. Of note, some of my favorite scares are indeed off the beaten path.\n\nI might be a bit gushy, but that's because Claire surpassed my expectations and has stood better than most of the other recent horror game releases on Steam I have played. It's a quality horror title for lovers of old-school styled horror with a bit of something new, or those who have come to enjoy 2D horror games like Lone Survivor or Clock Tower. It's rough around the edges, but has the heart, good execution, and cleverness to pull off what it strives to be, and excel at it, despite the few flaws it has.\n\nA bit slow, sometimes confusing, and I would not recommend going through it blind on Nightmare difficulty like I did, but a fantastic horror game that brings a lot in from the Silent Hill and Clock Tower class of horror, while also being its own thing that will be worth it for any genre enthusiast. But maybe wait to play through it once some of the bugs are ironed out.","July 22, 2014","true","8.0"," 77 of 86 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","77","86","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/recommended/252830/","goldenkitten","Goldenkitten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/","627 products in account","A better Silent Hill than the last three Silent Hills. Claire takes the Corpse Party route of using old school graphics but newer gameplay design decisions, mechanics, and general feel to create a rather excellent Horror game all its own. Only where Corpse Party was going for a distinctly Eastern style of Horror, Claire instead uses the more generalized Silent Hill approach.\n\nThough it won’t win anyone over who’s a serious graphics ***** the stylized 16-bit graphics are wonderfully detailed and manage to suck you in to the atmosphere in a way you’d never think a 2D game could. Sprites are dark, apocalyptic, gruesome, and backed up by some good lighting that really plays with you trying to set off a sense of claustrophobia. It’s put against an amazing soundscape that ranges between terrifying, foreboding, soothing, and even upbeat depending on what the scene calls for in a way rarely seen outside of games with larger budgets.\n\nGameplay is centered around exploring an almost mazelike environment (using a suspiciously Silent Hill-esque map), finding key items, and running from roaming monsters. Claire is the first 2D horror game I’ve found where running and hiding from your enemies actually works and serves as an example of how to do this for future games. Though you can’t destroy enemies you can sprint for short distances, and even perform an evasive jump to get past them. This jump isn’t overpowered and you can get yourself killed but it offers a greater deal of tactical options instead of other games that have tried this (such as Knock-Knock) where you would wind up getting stuck and simply couldn't do anything to save yourself. Enemies are surprisingly intimidating and have even spooked me a few times but the game is well designed meaning that if there is an enemy there’s a good chance there’s a hiding spot or long corridor to run from them nearby (enemies can chase you across screens) giving you a chance to survive.\n\nWithout spoilers the story is somewhere between Silent Hill and something more concrete. Though it drops you in with few answers there does seem to be a greater sense of “what’s happening” as the game continues though there are some surreal encounters with other denizens. Short version of what you can learn in the first five minutes; you are Claire, your mother is in the hospital, stuff goes REALLY bad really quick. I won’t say more than that but suffice it to say it’s kept me invested and coming back.\n\nThere are a handful of bugs mostly associated with how the map displays icons. But these are few, far-between, and don't really effect the game when they do happen. But worth pointing out they’re there for the sake of being fair.\n\nSo all in all Claire is a fantastic game, a brilliant triumph for the slowly building trend of using old-school graphics for horror games, and a must own for any horror game fan; especially lovers of Silent Hill.","July 9, 2014","true","5.4"," 41 of 54 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","41","54","0","0"

The major issue is that some times after you reload after death, some certain key obstacles (like closed doors) are back, but the key item you need to open them is already gone. This literally made the game unfinishable for me, and damn near it's end too.\nDon't get me wrong - for once we got a really good horror game, that reminds me of Clock Tower series, and the performance is mostly memorable and well-executed by devs, so I would definetely recommend buying it.

For instance areas that are calm have eerie sense of sadness, loneliness, abandonment and little hope while areas that are chaotic have intense emotions of fear, suffering, hopelessness and madness while at certain times the atmosphere takes a combination of these two (To experience fully recommend not going objective too fast and also lights out and headphones on.)\n\nGameplay Mechanics: Another thing that the game does an excellent job in keeping tension going is by putting players in the role as Claire who is put in this nightmarish world with only defense is a dog (warns of danger), blocking doors (if possible) , running and hiding.  Now when it comes to the running and hiding aspect of the game it should be noted here that when running your energy will drain quickly so use sparingly and once enemies see you they become relentless and by breaking down doors or crawling through from certain vents so it’s up to as the player to use both cunning and understanding of the environment around you both in terms of running and hiding, but understand since they are unpredictable if player is careless they will use the environment against you or if the player tries to hide in plain sight they will draw you out.  Last thing that keeps the tension going is a balance act you would have to maintain between the protagonist’s health and sanity.  Now at first the balancing act starts off easy but as progress it will become bit more difficult terms of enemies that attack you physically and/or mentally to environmental changes that you will not expect to occur.\n\nInventory Management: Now the game Claire to a certain degree portrays a specific type of inventory management in the form of a backpack which contains a limited amount of square space and each square space can only hold one item in each one combined with idea that items must be used wisely which provides a challenge of its own, while I like this feature there is one flaw to it which the only way Claire describes the item is by the player picking it up which results in loss of space to point where you would have to use items whether you need to or not to make room for items you need in order to complete your objective and/or side quest as you progress (suggestion: create secondary storage for items for later use or create an option where it describes the item and yes or no if the player wants to pick it up.)\n\nMap: The map in general is one those learning curve type maps that you would either love it or hate it which I love it because not only does it help navigate throughout without being completely lost which provides a challenge in itself, but also the design remind me a little bit of horror games like siren.\n\nPuzzles: Now the puzzles in Claire in general come in two different types optional which you can skip if you want to (note: recommend not skipping more variety and little more challenging then main puzzles and some connect with the story in a way) and main game puzzles that you have to complete in order to progress which both of these types of puzzles not only help with the overall pacing but provide challenge within themselves.\n\nReplay ability: Now there is replay ability in terms of not only multiple endings and achievements, but also if you’re the type of player after completing want bonus challenge Claire offers this in the form of two basic difficulty modes hard and nightmare.\n\nOverall Story: The story in Claire is a mix bag here it’s excellent in one aspect and another way it struggles fully stay up float.  Now what Claire does excellent is how the game presents itself by having Claire herself narrate in the form of text her thoughts and emotions while combined with the emotions she displayed was believable to the point I find myself caring what’s going happen to her base of the choices I made, certain sequences (memories) in Claire will occur which will allow to have idea not only what her past was like but also the reason behind her situation which is designed and set up in way that never over stays its welcome combined with items you find to put in your journal that which all together seems to use a little bit of Silent Hill formula.  Now don’t get wrong I found story interesting and I don’t expect games like Claire to hold my hand, however the story isn’t perfect I just couldn’t shake the feeling off there were certain plots arguably missing, just there to be in the game or/and seemed a bit on the rushed side which the main issue behind this is that the game Claire seems reference the individual enough to point where he is very memorable but not much to go on to actually piece together what happen to him or maybe it was just simply lost in translation with me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPros:\nAtmosphere/environment: Will either scare or keep you on edge.\nGameplay Mechanics: Will keep tension going throughout.\nInventory Management: is present in terms of space and item use.\nMap: Provide well balance learning curve.\nReplay ability: Is present in terms of multiple endings, achievements and contains two difficulty settings hard and nightmare.\nOverall Story: Believable story due to Claire displaying her thoughts and emotions text and body movement and/or expressions, sequences that occur (memories) that don’t over stay its welcome because of how it was designed and set up.\n\nMix:\n\nPuzzles: come in two different types optional (which are slightly more challenging and connect with the story in a way) while main puzzles provide certain challenge and do also have a connection to story but variety is not there in my opinion.\n\nCons:\n\nInventory Management doesn’t give option to store or pick item up or not.\nOverall Story: The story is interesting the problem is certain plots are either missing, just in there to be in the game or/and a little bit on the rushed side.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my time playing Claire will go back to explore for the alternate endings, atmosphere/environment and gameplay.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is a fan or new to both the gameplay and genre.","October 28, 2014","true","32.1"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","33","41","0","0"

However for the kind of person who enjoys to explore and discover everything a game has to offer, I can see maybe 10 hours of playtime for this title.\n\nOne feature I would've liked to have seen in the game is an option to play it without taking any damage, so I could go through it and enjoy the pixel enviorments at my own leisure, but that is of course a minor thing that doesn't detract from the experience at all.\n\nIf the game does have a major flaw it would be that the dialouge, and story could have used some work, while I understand everything that was going on, the story could have fleshed out the characters a bit more.\n\nThere is no combat in the game, and while this is an interesting mechanic, I felt it could have been handled better than it was, for example there were not enough spots to hide.\n\nThe flashlight did not do much and wasn't required to beat the game, this felt like a missed opportunity gameplay wise, as I feel flashlight use could have been made more useful. To be specific maybe the flashlight could make you immune to being scared while it's in use, or perhaps it could temporarily scare off monsters?\n\nThe biggest issue I have with the game is there are parts of it that seem impossible to complete unless you have a whole bunch of health items stacked up, and this is becuase of your "sanity meter". If one has low "sanity" they start taking damage, the worst part is aside from items, there isn't really a way for one to restore thier "sanity", or at least none I could figure out.\n\nLaslty it would be nice to have an option view all of the endings/notes one has unlocked.\n\nThis game currently would garner a 3.5/5 from me, if the game fixed all of the above I would have rated it higher.\nStill it's a neat little indie title, worth one's money, and especially worth one's cash if bought on sale!\n- Celx Requin","January 7, 2015","true","6.1"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Of course it has its own flavor, unfortunately things that make it different also make it less enjoyable.\nClaire's strongest point is probably its graphical design, making you wonder what will you see next, what other gruesome things will developers come up with. And that is pretty much the only good thing I can say about this game, everything else is rather... meh.\nTo start of, the story is so vague it is really hard to care for the main character (or the world that surrounds her). Sure, she no doubt has a tragic backstory, but every hint we get of it just feels like the same old thing we already seen before.\nClaire also shares a problem that Lone Survivor had (but on a much bigger and thus more confusing scale), which is how they present the world - both games show 2D side scrolling view of the world with an ability to enter rooms and corridors that lay perpendicular to your current location. This gets really confusing really fast as Claire features maps that are built to look and feel like actual mazes. It almost becomes a necessity to open the map after every step you take.\nSpeaking of Lone Survivor, one of the biggest differences and also by far the weakest element of Claire is how they deal with enemies. In case of Claire, the only real option is to simply run, and not the "get the hell out of here if you want to live" kind of run, but simply moving, often even passing by them - the simple fact of running is just about enough to dodge most of them. Perhaps switching to a higher difficulty could make this a bigger challenge, but lets be honest, fundamentally it just isn’t a very fun mechanic, especially compared to Lone Survivor where you could not only run from your enemies, but also kill them, lure them away, or simply sneak pass by them.\n\nIn the end I played Claire for around 3 hours before finally deciding to drop it - all because a simple thought entered my mind: "Am I actually having fun?"\n\n6/10\n","October 3, 2014","false","2.8"," 56 of 89 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","56","89","0","0"

You play as Claire as she navigates multiple locals to complete missions and progress the overall story. You have no weapons, only a lighter/flightlight, your wits and your pet dog (Who will only warn you of nearby enemies, but I suppose that is more than my cat would do) to navigate through the nightmarish halls to out run and out smart the lurking monsters.\n\nSpeaking of enemies, some will attack you physially while some will attack you psychologically, causing you to become scared. If Claire stays scared for to long she will begain to take physical damage, so in essence you have two health pools to manage.\n\nLike any survival game, you can explore and scavenge for health items, notes and batteries for your flashlight, not to mention some pretty interesting puzzles to find and solve. If you explore the right locations you will occassionally come across other survivors who can offer you side missions to do while exploring. These are not mandontory and can be skipped all together.\n\nThere is replayability value in the game as there are multiple endings you can unlock based on what you do in game. Completing the story with a decent amount of exploration you can expect to finish up in 4 to 5 hours.\n\nIf you enjoy survival horror I highly recommend this game.

Silent Hill is, of course, a brilliant horror game to take inspiration from, representing such a deep well of gameplay and oddities to choose from. Claire chooses not only to take inspiration from Silent Hill but also Lone Survivor, another indie game inspired by, you guessed it, Silent Hill. So what does that leave us with?\n\nThe game opens with Claire fighting off nightmares while dozing in her mom's hospital room. When she steps out for coffee, everything goes all shitworldy and she ends up running from actual nightmares, reliving several traumatic moments in her life, and trying a million busted doors. The side-scrolling gameplay is strongly reminiscent of Silent Hill games, with a huge, sprawling map of rooms you can only get into about half of. You usually have a goal you're trying to reach, but unlike Silent Hill the purpose in reaching it is never very clear. Nor is how you get there, because a great big building is really hard to navigate in 2D. It's a similar problem to Lone Survivor except way worse, because each of the three areas you scramble through is like SH3 mall-sized.\n\nUnlike the games that inspired it, however, Claire has no combat. Instead, you are expected to flee from the strange ink-blot looking monsters that roam the endless halls. Ironically this actually takes a lot of the tension out of the game, because you have a generous amount of sprint and can run directly through and past your foes. As long as you are paying the tiniest bit of attention, you can easily avoid ever being caught. This renders most of your inventory items moot, since most are for healing your health or your sanity, a system cribbed from Amnesia but without any clear purpose. And if there are no weapons or ammo or any pressing need for healing items, there's no real reason to explore, is there?\n\nI keep seeing this trend in indie games where they take heavy inspiration from a popular game but only get halfway to the same level of design. Much like Our Darker Purpose was to Binding of Isaac, Claire has all the parts of a Silent Hill game (or Lone Survivor successor) without actually making them work together. The enemies inspire no terror, the items are pointless, and the maps are confusing and sprawling without giving any reason to explore them. A disjointed story is laid over all of this about an angsty teen being an angsty teen because maybe bad things happened in her life? Whatever it is, it takes far too long to get to the point.\n\nI honestly started out pretty okay with this game because it was simple and the art is really good, but after 90 minutes I could no longer push myself to finish it. The story was going nowhere, the level design was just hallway after hallway with more and more monsters, and then I found a really cool room that killed me without warning. Literally without warning, it just suddenly popped up the pause menu, except I couldn't unpause because I was dead. Well, I can take a hint, Claire.","October 19, 2015","false","1.5"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","24","33","0","2"

The only light sources come from a clock that reads 3:33 and an open window that lets in some moonlight. When the girl hops out of bed to scurry out of the room in a 2D side-scrolling fashion, she's yanked back toward the shadows that lurk over her bed.\n\nAfter that she's allowed to scour her darkened how looking for the brother and parents. Windows illuminate dark hallways that have shadowy birds flying through them. The screen begins to flicker, shake and glitch as each room gets darker than the next. Static on the television, the only lights pop as Claire walks by and shadowy soccer balls roll by her feet. Minutes tick by, but the next clock still reads 3:33 as well. The moon must be shrouded as no more light shines through the window's open curtains.\n\nWhen Claire reaches her parents room, everyone is gone, the bed is floating and her mom tells her that everything's going to be okay. That's when Claire wakes up curled in a ball on a chair inside the St. Barbara hospital pediatrics ward. There's a photo of a happy couple in the background with a different photo of a beach over it. The room is lit by a light overhead and red candle that flickers. The curtains are half open and its pitch black outside.\n\nClaire is a young blonde girl with barrettes in her hair wearing a hoody and jeans. Claire knows that she needs to stop sleeping there, because that place is getting to here. From that point Claire wanders the hospital floor. The place is pristine and nothing out of the ordinary other than she's the only person there. There are still hints that a black fog or haze watches her from just beyond the light's reach.\n\nShe can run, jump and open doors to get from one area to the next. We can assume that since she's in a hospital that's the reason why she can't run fast or run a long distance without running out of breath. There are plenty of maxcell batteries and cola for her to collect marked as shinny objects here and there to catch her gaze.\n\nSeveral doors are locked or blocked. She can even hear the television on inside and the doors that are unlocked Claire wants to leave the inhabitants in peace. Its routine for Claire, she says its always been quiet at night. Hallway after hallway, they begin to get darker and unfriendly. After searching through a dozen hallways its safe to say that Claire is alone.\n\nThere is then a sign of life, her phone rings,s he answers, but the person on the other end hangs up. She finds plenty of things to interact with, plaques, couches to curl upon and rooms that let her save any progress. Upon reaching a coffee room, Claire says that there are still a few hours before school starts and she needs to get back home. Then she says she misses sleeping in her own bed. So it seems that Claire has a conflict. Stuck in a hospital overnight that she needs to go home from. Waking up in a chair rather than a bed. She's in street clothes instead of a hospital gown.\n\nIt is just an ordinary, mundane hospital. The water tastes like dirt, there is a rickety elevator that almost breaks with her in it. The elevator opens on the wrong floor. She feels that she must have pushed the wrong button. Soon the rooms become uninviting. Rust seeps out from vents. The bright lights get dim. There's a scratching sound and before she realizes, she's staring at a hospital bed with a red candle on it and a shadowy mist hovering over it.\n\nThe mist slowly consumes the entire room before  Claire herself is on a table with red candles around her on the floor, shadowy figures walking around and a giant, fleshless, meaty creature hovering above her. Does it have a face? Is that a face? No is that also a face? Are those four giant teeth or four giant nails? What are those dozen shadow people around her? Claire is stuck, something is holding her down.\n\nIt all comes to an end though as a barking German Shepard makes the shadow men dissipate. She knows this German Shepard, its her dog Anubis or Ani as Claire likes to say. With her faithful dog here, the bond is broken and she's free to move while the fleshless muscle creature stays clung to the ceiling.\n\nClaire realizes her phone is busted, the hospital is dark with only dim lights or red candles here and there, so she's forced to use her lighter to guide the way. This lighter never runs out of fuel and she soon finds a flashlight to light the way, but it requires Maxcell batteries.\n\nThe hospital has changed completely and its in disarray. Furniture strewn about, doors have giant chains and locks around them. Some hallways are blocked off with rubble. Claire has to push things aside to get into doors. Something happened in this hospital.\n\nWith her faithful dog here with her, she needs to meet the challenge to survive going room to room in a labyrinthine complex. Going through air ducts, elevators, doors and so on. She checks each closet, bathroom stall, locker and trash bag looking for items to stay alive. Lucky for her she has a map that shows where she'll be headed, what doors are locked and which ones need keys. Claire can pick a door's lock with a hairpin and enough time to do it. With each cooridoor containing plenty of doors, Claire can find herself lost with each new hallway without checking her map.\n\nAnubis growls, Claire wonders what it is, but she soon learns to recognize that when Ani growls, there's a presence with them. A shadowy figure with a white outline of a face that will charge the two of them and chase them from room to room. If she hides beyond a door, the creature will smash the glass and begin to course through the door turning it black until the being springs into the room with them. Their only resolve then is to hide in a laundry basket or closet. The creatures make static screeches to crawl up Claire's spine.\n\nEvery time a shadow creature touches her it drains Claire's health and the only way she restores it is by chugging various types of cola or coffee. She also has a sanity factor and the more she sees, the crazier she can become. Depleting health or sanity mean most certain death for her.\n\nClaire's only real power is to face her fears and bait these shadow creatures through room after room until she finds a closet to hide in so the creature can walk by. This hospital is a hostile place with scarce resources. There is a limited bounty of batteries and cola so when she's out, that's it.\n\nAs isolating, atmospheric and terrifying as the hospital can be, there's someone else in St. Barbara. There's another patient here that Claire will inevitably find. You get choices for Claire at key moments, but I feel they are of little consequence.\n\nThe danger comes from more than these creatures and giant shadow reapers, there are a few hazards here and there, such as her own mind working against her. Claire has dark hallucinations of when she picked a dog from the pound. Her mind twists the memory into something horrifying. The dogs int heir kennels are only a pair of glowing eyes. You can begin to wonder what is her reality. Who she is and why she's stuck in this hospital.\n\nI think the bottom line here is that the game is a tense experience that gets lost in hallways.","September 27, 2015","true","2.8"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","19","26","3","0"

In fact the whole gameplay consists of that.\n- Map is not accurate: some stuff don't get added to the map, like some blocked passages, monsters and shortcuts, bit by bit adding to your frustration.\n- Map is confusing: trying to represent a huge maze in a 2D game makes the map very confusing and odd about the placement of doors and seeing where you're heading to.\n- Monsters/enemies camp, waiting to mince you; but don't worry: they don't stay in the same place, they FOLLOW you through the map and through the doors.\n- When you're in your inventory the game isn't paused: so you're running away from a monster and trying to see on the map where you should go and meanwhile the monster is gnawing on your leg. Yay.\n- You pickup batteries to refill your flashlight. Except that you can totally ignore the flashlight and use a lighter that doesn't need any refuelling.?!\n- XBox controls are wonky: the map shortcut button showed at the beginning doesn't work. Also you can't remap the buttons.\n- 1/5 of the time the inventory doesn't work and you have to close it and reopen it. Annoying and ruins the immersion.\n- You have to manage your health a bit à la Resident evil: your health is represented in your inventory and you use candies and sodas to heal. Except that your health status isn't very explicit nor intuitive. A color code like in Resident Evil would help.\n- So you collect butterflies. You're not told why or what they do.\n\nYes I barely played it but I can't stand any more of that maze combined with the incomplete map, it's very confusing and annoying. Adding to that all the controls problems and the non-pause in the inventory and map makes it unbearable.

Otherwise, the graphics are fine for a 2D side scrolling game, it certainly has a Silent Hill feel to it which may or may not appeal to many fans of the series, and thus far the storyline and horror is well done.  It's showing you things that you really need to be afraid of (mental illnesses and not random monsters in the dark).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WitteCS/recommended/252830/","WitteCS","'Witte - Ice Cream Time","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WitteCS/","1273 products in account","Claire is a 2D psychological survival-horror game that pulls a lot of inspiration from Silent Hill, Clock Tower, and a few other horror games of the early 2000s. I had been following the title since mid-2013, and finally gave it a play after a few patches had been delivered for the game post-release (which to the developers credit, they have been very active in responding to problems the game has via patches and being active on their steam community forums and twitter). I had played about an hour of the game last February off Desura, which was very rough at the time. I wasn't quite sure what the final product was going to end up like.\n\nClaire stars the titular character as she wakes up from a nightmare about her childhood. She is in the hospital taking care of her mother, who is sickly and bedridden. However, as she fetches coffee to keep herself awake, the hospital suddenly changes... Shifts into some form of nightmare realm. Quickly finding aid from a dog known as Anubis, they go to try and find an escape to the twisted terror they've found themselves trapped in.\n\nIn Claire, you explore labyrinth-like locations full of enemies, traps, puzzles, scares, and atmosphere as you open locked doors and trigger events that advance the story. Honestly its all rather simple. Occasionally you meet a person in the labyrinth you can help with something via a side-quest, or some choice you can make or optional puzzle you can partake in. Your actions go towards what ending you'll get at game's end, of which there are six of.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, but is supported by good design, an actually helpful map (surprising as I find maps are usually useless in 2D horror games like this), fantastic atmosphere, and a number of surreal and interesting moments throughout, backed by a good lighting engine and moody sound design.\n\nMonsters come in a few varieties, but none can be killed, simply ran from and hid from. And they can be determined buggers in hunting you down, bashing down doors you try to escape through, and can follow you into any room outside of save rooms. You either have to outrun them, outsmart them (like blocking a door), out-climb them (they can't climb things it seems), or hide in a closet/similar hiding place. Though some monsters don't chase you at all. One common threat is a type of monster that won't chase you, but getting near it will drain your 'sanity'.\n\nSanity isn't for insane effects or anything, but survival in Claire. Like Clock Tower's panic feature, basically. The more loss of 'calm' and scared you become, the more you'll start taking damage, until you're panicking and taking damage for simply panicking. A big part of the game, especially later in, is managing your health and sanity and playing wisely. This is helped by the fact that like Resident Evil, the stages are large with multiple paths, allowing you to make strategic paths through the facility once you've come more familiar with its layout.\n\nNormally I build-up to my impressions of a review by talking about the elements, but to explain Claire I need to work backwards... I loved it. It's going up there as what I would list as the best 2D horror games out there, along with the likes of Lone Survivor, Clock Tower, Yume Nikki, Last Door, Ib, Witch's House, etc. Claire succeeds in making an unnerving atmosphere that actually managed to spook me on a few occasions, interesting moments in both gameplay, design, and narrative, and wrapping it all together into an enjoyable horror game package.\n\nAnd its with this severe love I have for the game I must mention that the game still has some problems. The developers are responding to them and still patching the game, but I need to make note of this as the time I played it (version 1.145) that I ran into a number of issues. I played the game kind of stupidly on Nightmare difficulty (the hardest difficulty) on my first playthrough of the game, and as a mention I would not suggest playing on this difficulty unless you really want a challenge and have some patience. But maybe because of this I experienced more problems, as most of what I had problems with was the sanity system, which was very unforgiving and has weird problems like certain cutscene spots draining my sanity so fast I would die during cutscenes and would actively have to heal myself to keep myself alive to read the dialogue in cutscenes. And then some minor things, like how I found the flashlight not really useful most of the time and just defaulted to the lighter, or a few areas later in the game feeling a bit too much like trial-and-error in parts.\n\nI'm sure most of my problems will be addressed with future patches again, and don't think this game is worth passing up on for this.\n\nClaire feels a bit similar to some other kinds of horror games, with the easiest comparison to make being Lone Survivor (they share a bit more in common than just being 2D games with some Silent Hill influence, though let it be known if you liked Lone Survivor, you will most likely enjoy this). However, it also manages to create its own feel and tale of horror, and the developments in both gameplay and story for the most part feel satisfying.\n\nIt's a bit slow, there are a few places where navigating and where you're supposed to go can be a bit confusing. However, the levels have a fun exploration element and will usually reward you for taking time off the beaten path, with a variety of side-quest, goodies, hidden scenes and scares, and more.\n\nSpeaking of which, the game manages to pack some good scares and "WTF" moments through its course. I found myself a bit more comfortable and less on-edge after the first area, but the game managed to put me on edge and make me feel uneasy through the beginning first hour or two, and had its moments throughout its course. Of note, some of my favorite scares are indeed off the beaten path.\n\nI might be a bit gushy, but that's because Claire surpassed my expectations and has stood better than most of the other recent horror game releases on Steam I have played. It's a quality horror title for lovers of old-school styled horror with a bit of something new, or those who have come to enjoy 2D horror games like Lone Survivor or Clock Tower. It's rough around the edges, but has the heart, good execution, and cleverness to pull off what it strives to be, and excel at it, despite the few flaws it has.\n\nA bit slow, sometimes confusing, and I would not recommend going through it blind on Nightmare difficulty like I did, but a fantastic horror game that brings a lot in from the Silent Hill and Clock Tower class of horror, while also being its own thing that will be worth it for any genre enthusiast. But maybe wait to play through it once some of the bugs are ironed out.","November 7, 2014","true","22.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

This was another small time game in the part of the horror genre that I miss dearly, and wish there are more of out there at this point. But since this type of game has been around for a while, and was more likely inspired by early Silent Hill and Lone Survivor, I would not say that it is lacking tough competitors, I've been meaning to do this for a while, so with that, let's go over the game Claire piece by piece:\n\nGameplay: Claire's gameplay is a bit odd, sanity management can be difficult in levels where eerie things are happening, which makes things a bit more frustrating considering one. small... detail, but I will get to that in a minute, I promise you that. Claire's mechanics mean she needs a flashlight for lighting, but there have been about 2 or 3 times where I have actually needed a flash light, I'm not sure if it helps with your sanity or anything, it's just there, and the lighter works just as well. Now one problem with Claire that is similar in Lone Survivor is the map system, oh dear lord the map system. In Lone Survivor, it wasn't as bad because they slowly, and gradually give you more and more of the map to learn and get used to, and by the time you get the new stuff, the old routes are already memorized and easy to get through, sure there's a spot or two you may miss, but most of the time, it doesn't break your game flow. With Claire, however, you are set from different location to different location very often and I do not think you go to a single one twice.\n\nThis means, once you no longer need the map and you know the place like the back of your hand, you're put in a completely different area and it's back to staring at the map, and it breaks immersion. It is also a tad difficult to figure out how maps made with ups and downs works in a 2D sidescroller at times, Also, not to spoil anything, but the monster at the end is the only one you are supposed to fight, you can't fight the others, but this one, you can, which can be a bit confusing when you got so used to hiding in closets and boxes. One thing that really annoyed me is that your loyal pet Anubis was only used to alert you when monsters were nearby, and to comfort you in a couple moments, why this annoys me is because due to a majority of the puzzles being confusing and vague, all I remember is really wishing Anubis could find notes for me or lead me to hints, anything. But that might just be me thinking about Mercy in Valiant Hearts, I just might have high expectations for friendly dog characters now.\n\nStory: Claire's overall story and plot twist is... Well, to not spoil it, think of 3 typical horror story plot twists, and think of the common or overused ones. Chances are, one of those three, if you guessed the ending with it, was right on the money. This does not make the story bad, though, not necessarily, it's pretty hard to think up of plot twists in horror stories at times, especially a completely original one, it's still being done, but it is difficult. I don't think that's necessarily the problem with Claire, Claire's character is pretty well defined for the short time she is given, strong willed, responsible, hard to upset, as well as other features that I will not get into just yet. I think the issue is the game gives you too many answers, in a shady game with a lot of interpretation such as this one, giving this many clear answers may not be a good thing, I'm glad they're leaving that comfort zone, but a lot of things become a lot less interesting once their mystery is gone, but not explaining enough will only annoy people and nothing else, so you have to find that sweet spot of mystery and answers, and I think Claire leans too much towards answers.\n\nAnother problem is that they give a lot of small characters that are likely symbolic to Claires mindset and past, which is all well and good, but there are a lot of them, and they all usually make one impression, or depending on what you do, technically, two impressions. So some seem to not give you any information on her, and others seem like they could have done much more if given more time, and a few are downright forgettable, you can easily end up with any of the endings not interacting with every single one, just an amount depending on the ending. The game is not entirely that predictable, and doesn't give you ALL the answers, we are not certain what happened that lead to this, what the exact trigger was, or if anyone Claire used to know is still alive or not, although it is implied in one ending (Good lord this takes a lot of beating around the bush). I feel like they should have taken the Lone Survivor route, rather than about 10 characters giving you small important things to the story, and are a part of your personality and past, have 3 different types of characters that cover three different categories of the protagonist, I will tell you I can remember more about the main three illusive characters, and likely the side characters as well in Lone Survivor than the crowd in Claire. I will say one thing, though, it takes one of those crappy childhood moves in the game, and it did not go anywhere near the way I thought it was going. When they brought up an issue in the family, and violence in the family, it's incredibly unlikely you guessed which family member caused the issues when it was happening. But let's end on a lighter note on this subject before I end up spoiling the hardest to predict part of the story, I do enjoy how this game has a bit of it's own lore, Claire has her own depiction of the Carebears being her childhood enjoyment, she even has it as her ringtone for nostalgia, it must have been at least a decade that had pased and she still remembers that song, and one of the few things I remember very well in this game is the theme song to that in Claire, and good ol' sun cola.\n\nIn Summary: I do recommend this game, but not for the majority If you like Lone Survivor, and the earlier Silent Hill, you'll likely like this as well, because it's a bit more of it. The game looks nice, with a lovely bit of lighting. Even with awkward maps and a lot of side tracking, you can get a bit of enjoyment off of the development of the character and her past, it is a fairly interesting one despite the obvious parts, and there actually is some unpredictability in the bits and pieces despite what I said. If you're looking for a game that has an understandable map, more memorable side characters rather than atmosphere, something with a higher replay value than maybe 4 runs through at max, more likely than not, this is not the game for you, and with it usually being 10 dollars, I'm afraid you might be able to do better. Although I don't recommend it to all, for those who do, I bet you'll enjoy it for what it gives you.\n\nGo Elks!","June 5, 2015","true","9.7"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

I enjoy it, so that is no issue.\n\nSound:\nCreepy music, scary sound effects, the game has them all and i like it, good one here.\n\nGameplay:\n2D sidescroller, you walk, you run, you push objects, go through doors and pick up stuff, nothing overly special, but it works. In between you meet enemies that you cannot attack and weird characters you do a task for (mostly finding an item somewhere).\nThat is basically all i saw so far.\nNavigation doesn't work well, you need to check your ingame map constantly or else you get lost quicker than you can say "What?".\nAdd the fact that all the corridors look alike and you don't even have any distinctive feature to let you know where you are, which makes running around and looking for something specific tedious and boring.\n\nControls:\nClaire can jump, run, pick up stuff and use objects, but it would've been nice to have the option to remap the controls. Using an XBox controller, i was unable to remap the buttons and had to use the (little intuitive) default setting to work with it.\nEven after so many tries with the map, i cannot get a feel for the menu navigation.\nOtherwise the controls are responsive and your control over the character is good.\n\nStory:\nI didn't make it far into the game, so i cannot say much about it, but at this point i am more confused than anything else, nothing makes sense and so many questions pop up, i don't know which one to ask first.\nI suspect a "It was all a nightmare" kind of ending for this, even if i am wrong, i doN't have that much hope for the story.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game looks good, sounds good and makes a good first impression and then drops as quickly as a hot potato in your hands.\nThe boring explorations of seemingly endless and repetetive corridors, the lack of action (you basically just run through or away from enemies) and very few exciting parts make this game not worthwhile to me so far.\n\nCheck out a let's play of it somewhere before you decide if you want it or not.","December 26, 2014","false","0.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Something along the lines of: "Only one or two people made this game, ♥♥♥♥ you, we're not Valve or Gearbox and therein had a budget of precisely ♥♥♥♥-ALL, so you're gonna have to put up with the fact that this doesn't look or play anything like Bioshock Infinite."  But herein, of course, can lay the beauty of the whole endeavour...that perhaps not ALL of us want to play games like Bioshock Infinite; certainly not ALL the time.  Nice to have a little variety in our life experiences, right?  Which is precisely where "indie games" come in, for those of us adventurous enough to take a chance on them.  And Claire, I'm pleased to say, is by and largely one of the good ones.\n\nGetting back to my opening sentence, this is a game which could be readily described as a "love letter to old-school survival horror".  Well...sort of.  Firstly, there's the name of the lead character, who happens to wear a red jacket-y thing...a bit like a certain "Claire Redfield" character beloved to fans of the Resident Evil series.  Greater overall similarity, however, lies with the almost equally famous and long-running Silent Hill series, at least story-, tone- and location-wise (hospital, school, apartment); and then there's the slightly lesser-known but still quite significant Clock Tower series, which to the best of my knowledge kicked off the whole "stealth horror" notion of hiding in closets rather than actually FIGHTING beasties...a tradition which this game merrily follows in.\n\nOddly enough, though - and perhaps just a little less admirably, I'm sad to say - the game to which this arguably owes the greatest debt is a very, very RECENT one, itself a "love letter" to survival horror realised in crude-but-oddly-effective 2D, pixelated form.  Lone Survivor was the name of that game, and I'm kind of suspecting that THIS game may not have existed without it.  That was ALSO a shameless Silent Hill love-in, but y'know, as a huge Silent Hill fan myself, I'm really not gonna complain too bitterly about about EITHER game's existence.  I will, however, opine that Lone Survivor was at least marginally more successful than this one, and now I'll attempt to explain why...\n\nThe biggest problems with this game are, quite simply, the mapping and saving systems, neither of which I recall being so problematic in Lone Survivor.  This game faces much the same challenges mapping-wise as the earlier game - that is to say, both being two-dimensional games with confusingly three-dimensional maps - but it's a little poor how few significant locations (including, sometimes, the save points themselves) are clearly marked on the map once you've discovered them.  Expect to get lost...a lot.  The other problem herein is the monsters/evil ghosties you encounter...as they have a tendency to move about as they see fit, knocking down doors and what-have-you.  So not only are you lost, looking for the location of a save point or a puzzle which you are finally able to solve, but there may very well be monsters in the way which weren't there before!  So you try to avoid them (by awkwardly "jumping" over them!), maybe take some damage, maybe waste some health items, only to find you've gone the WRONG ♥♥♥♥ING WAY!  A bit unnecessarily frustrating at times, in other words.\n\nLook, I honestly don't have many complaints beyond that - well, okay, there is the fact that the "action" bits don't particularly work and get way too frequent towards the end - but I'm certainly grateful that people are inspired to make games like this, and eagerly look forward to whatever the developers get up to in the future.  Suffice it to say, if you loved Lone Survivor, you're gonna like this one too, and the same probably goes for the (at least more open-minded) Silent Hill fan-addicts out there.  Just think of this as the more "stealth"-oriented of the two super-pixelated Silent Hill "homages" recently unleashed upon the market, and decide if that sounds like your "thang".  If it does, you're unlikely to be disappointed.\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10.","December 17, 2014","true","8.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamehoard/recommended/252830/","gamehoard","Jeremy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamehoard/","173 products in account","To hear my full thoughts on Claire, listen to my review on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]\n\nClaire is a sidescrolling survival horror game with 16-bit-esque graphics. The horror is of the psychological variety, with you questioning what is real throughout the game. The game controls like a typical sidescroller but gameplay is firmly rooted in classic survival horror games. You have to explore, find items, solve puzzles, and avoid being killed by enemies, all while uncovering the story of the game. Along the way there are also a number of other characters to meet who present side quests and choices for you to make. Your choices, including whether or not to complete these missions, determines what kind of ending you get, of which there are many.\n\nOverall, we found the game very enjoyable in a twisted way. The game relies on building a constant sense of tension, rather than jump scares, in order to frighten players. You have no way to defend against enemies, items you need to survive are scarce, and you can only save in certain rooms which are spread out across large areas. While all of this makes the game very intense to play, it can also potentially lead to frustration since dying means a significant loss of progress.\n\nWhat's more frustrating though is trying to navigate sprawling 3D environments while moving in a 2D plane. Every time you enter a new room it's not clear if you are moving north, south, east, or west. Luckily, there is a map to help with this, but it's terribly inconsistent and lacking in detail. As a result, a lot of the game is spent feeling lost, which may be a good or bad thing for a survival horror game, depending on how you look at it.\n\nIf you can get past these frustrations, Claire is a great survival horror game that I think fans of the genre will really enjoy.","March 31","true","5.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The generic steam solution did not work for me. Found  solution  (yeah click there to see it yourself!) on community hub courtesy of steam user ZedNo_0. In steam more Claire/Claire folder contents into the primary Claire folder. This worked for me. Also apparently the developer's are working on an update.\n\nI've played for about 40 minutes so far to get a feel for the game.\n\nGraphics look good. Sound effects and ambience also create the right atmosphere.\n\nYou explore the maze like room's of a creepy hospital hospital trying to reach one objective after another while avoiding or running away from scary ghost monsters.\n\nNavigating the environment can be disorientating at first especially when you find yourself in an area with a new map for the first time. But once you get used to the map system it's pretty straight forward and that didn't really take me that long. You can use a torch but I didn't pay attention to all the tutorial explanations so I'm not what it's purpose really was. You have no means to fight the monsters. But you often have no choice but to go through rooms that they occupy whether it be by running past them and taking damage or getting around them somehow. They move faster than you. While you can run away from them, if you only move into the next room they will break down the door to get you. So they are pretty frightening lol. I think there is a strategy avoiding them e.g. luring them to a room with a closet you can hide in and waiting for them to go past. But I wasn't that advanced.\n\nThe game seem's to be pretty good so far. Reminds me of Silent hill especially with the comatose woman in the hospital bed. As long as it remain challenging, entertaining and isn't too short it should well worth the price.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 7, 2014","true","8.3"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","26","48","0","0"

There's ostensibly a map section in the game menu, but I have yet to find a map.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/252830/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Claire is a 2D low-fi horror game that relies heavily on scenery and atmosphere, and not jumpscares or horrifying imagery. Unfortunately, due to its nature, Lone Survivor comparisons are inevitable, and I think this game has less of an impact because of that exact reason. (I have seen people stating that the horror from both of these games borrows a lot from Silent Hill, but I have yet to play those)\nI enjoyed this game quite a lot, but it certainly isn't flawless, design-wise. I'll discuss important points later, and just give you a general overview of how the game works.\n\nI'll try to give a short overview of the game. Regarding other 2D, low-pixel horror games, Lone Survivor and Home spring to my mind. This is far closer to LS than Home, but with fewer interesting mechanics, and certainly has a more streamlined story (leaving a few unanswered questions regardless).\nYou play as Claire, and you don't know exactly where you are, despite the familiarity of the places you visit. There's always something wrong. Your job is to piece all the memories revealed to you with the symbolism present in order to find why you're there and more important, if you deserve to leave. The narrative is well put together, it was pretty interesting to me!\n\nVisual and Audio Design\nAs I said, it's very low-fi, but in a good way! Just like the previous games mentioned, the game gives you an outline for how the sceneries look, and let your mind take care of the little details. Overall, I think it looks really good. Besides, it also features modern lighting effects that give this game an edge over many retro looking games.\nThe sound-effects are also very raw and disturbing, and it's where I find the biggest similarities with LS. There's a lot of static noise, rather than the usual screaming. However, while LS did come as a surprise to me, this didn't felt quite as unique (although, I'm not trying to take credit away from this game, only talking about my subjective perception). Both the visual and the audio design fits together very nicely, and creates the kind of disturbing and uncomfortable horror that I like.\n\n\nOverall mechanics\nYour character has both Health and Fear, both of which can be replenished with different consumables. As excepted, enemies and disturbing places will make you more fearful, and may even decrease your health if you're on the verge of sanity. When enemies attack you, you also lose health. Scavenging for consumables is important, especially because you can not kill enemies, only run away from them. Literally. Stealth is almost inexistent, but I'll detail it later on.(1)\nYou have a lighter (that lights a small radius around you), and you later get a Flashlight, that consumes batteries, but it's more potent, and can also illuminate where you point with the mouse. This is a pretty cool feature, but it also carries some minor problems.(2)\n\nEnemies can follow you through rooms by destroying doors (the first times takes a while, but after that, they're pretty fast to change rooms). When you're spotted, your best bet is to run away, and try to loose them. You can do it by changing to a room twice without them seeing you, or hide in closets while they're breaking down the door. While it works, for the most part, not being able to attack them can be frustrating, especially when you're at low HP. This leaves less room to explore as well.\n\nAround the places, you can find Notes (written by someone close to you) that may hint at why you're there and what it is. You may also find some people, that may even be more lost that you do. Each of them brings a different perspective on life, based on their own situation. I found these to be pretty nice, and they also added some interesting bits to the game's "message" and narrative.\n\nOther than that, there are also some puzzles. This are half great, half poor. Some of them simply depend on environmental clues and are fairly easy, if you pay attention. These rely on clues around that particular puzzle, and not ones that you may or may not have found 3 hours before. This makes for good pacing!\nOthers, are more reliant on riddles. While they were cool, they were also a bit too ambiguous. After I knew the solution, I could see it made sense, but there were also other equally valid possibilities... That was not so good. I liked the idea, but I don't think the execution was quite there.\nRegardless, these puzzles are far apart, and there are not a lot. They're there to change pacing, and they do just that pretty well.\n\nI'll try to go into some details now.\n\n1. Saving and Map Systems\nI've found some problems with these. There are safe rooms spread around the maps, where you can save. There's no other kind of checkpoints, it's all manual and only in certain rooms. This could be fine, but I didn't like it very much.\nAs I've mentioned, the maps are very maze-like in their construction. There are lots of locked doors, doors that only open from one side, crawlspaces, etc. While the "blocked" doors are marked on the map after you try to open them, it's still very messy. Each map is a bit too cluttered, which is a problem when you're trying to explore everything.\nI know that being lost can be a pretty crucial part to horror, but it's hard to couple that with exploration. All the notes, people, butterflies, etc. that you collect do affect the ending, despite being optional. The endings are determined by your overall attention to detail. But I digress.\nAdd to this, the fact that you can't kill nor avoid enemies. And Sprinting has a cooldown (as expected). If you find an unexpected enemy, you'll simply run, and try to enter the closest door. This is a recepy to get lost in 5 seconds. The map marks visitted rooms, which is good, and you can get back to where you were, but now knowing that there's an enemy waiting for you. Later on, it's also easy to run from one enemy and bump into another, and end up 7 rooms away from where you wanted to be, with a few more collectables and low HP. After this, it's very easy to die, especially if an enemy happens to be at a door where you enter a room.\n\nIt's a bit convoluted, sorry, but this is how I felt. It got messy. And the biggest problem was to get the progress gone when you died. The safe rooms aren't too far between, but were enough for it to be frustrating when going for the collectibles, for which you need to explore every corner.\nThis is also tied to the fact that enemies can't be beaten, and rarely avoided without taking damage. Later on, the maps get more confusing (intentionally so, which was part awesome, part annoying), so this problem aggravates itself.\nI think it's just a problem tied to making the game focus on Exploration and Tension at the same time, two almost paradoxical concepts.\n\n\n2. Mouse controlled Flashlight\nThis is very minor, but worth noting nonetheless. The flashlight is the only thing you need the mouse to control in this game. Literally the only thing. When you're walking with the lighter only, the result is a mouse pointer on the screen. Oops, there goes immersion.\nI think that it is a cool mechanic, but it would have been much better if the game featured other mouse-driven mechanics, even if they were very minor.\n\n\n3. Invincible Enemies\nI'll tackle this again quickly. Enemies are far scarier if you feel defenseless, certainly! However, the player should never be this defenseless, just for the fact that it hinders the gameplay, at times where the tension is low. I think that LS avoided this problem very elegantly. You were hopeless if an enemy surprised you, you were hopeless and had to run. Otherwise, you could attract them with meat, and then stealthily avoid them.\n\nEven if not unique, Claire is well put together, and features good psych-horror!\n","December 7, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dead Space comes to mind there. (calm yourselves, I enjoyed Dead Space too)\n\nIf you're looking for a game that explores feelings of guilt, isolation, grief and familial anger, then you should consider getting this.

While I definitely think survival horror fans should all try this game, there are a few things that kind of bother me that I think are worth mentioning:\n\n1. Still kinda glitchy, especially the map and inventory screens. I should be able to just hover my mouse over an item and see what it does; it doesn't always work right. Markers on the map ended up being a nightmare too. I could add one, several, or none depending on where I was, and I could never remove any. I think there are also keys or buttons you can use to throw away inventory items? I could usually just "use" an item to get rid of it anyway, but this stuff would have been good to know, and I don't think the game ever told me how to do it.\n\n2. Besides the narrative importance, the dog wasn't very useful for the actual game. Besides growling when enemies are nearby, I can't say I ever witnessed or was informed of anything useful they could do. I imagine it was inspired by the dog from Haunting Ground, so... why not borrow some more of that? I dunno, just having running or hiding being your only option with enemies got to feel sort of tedious.\n\n3. If you're already big on Silent Hill, this comes with the territory, but the maps can range from slightly convoluted to "where on Earth am I or am I even still on Earth?" It's made less painful than SH since the map loads up quickly, but you will be checking it a lot.\n\nThe game definitely has its quirks, but if you like the games it was inspired by, you should be golden. Everything besides what I mentioned was either good or great. The music was all moody and sounded good enough. The graphics, which seem to be inspired by LS, manage to actually outdo it with some of the fancier lighting effects (IMO). Enemy variety is okay, but it doesn't matter too much since you just run from everything, I guess. I'd have to say that for the sake of reference, I still prefer Lone Survivor over this, but this game does a lot of cool stuff in its own right.","August 7, 2014","true","3.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While looking similar to Lone Survivor, I didn't dismiss it as some knock off since I try to give most horror games a chance.  Pretty interesting game.  Good amount of story to get into while not feeling conveluted or trying too hard to be 'deep'.  The main character can be somewhat relateable and immersion isn't difficult.\nSound is great. Talked to their sound designer on Reddit and seemed like a cool guy (even took the time to give some tips in networking so + to the devs)   it was memorable and the sounds had a fit to the atmosphere. Seeing a television on felt like a safe area and/or dream like atmosphere.\n\nI have some things I did not like. and it may contain some small spoilers.\n\nNot enough dog involvement. Kind of like a radio from Silent HIll in alerting the player of enemy presense.\nWould like to see more.\nNot a fan of the map.\nNot too much going on in the enemy area.  Most enemies are different sizes of scribbly eyes. There are the faceless creatures but ...that's about it.  Still some tough spots and they get the job done.\nI really think there's a lot more that can be done in this game.  But it does the job for a short side scrolling survival horror game.

No, seriously, I do. Rather, I really really want to like it.\n\nThis is a 2D psychological horror at it's finest. At least that's the impression I got when I loaded up the game. It takes indirect inspirations from games like Lone Survivor, whilst at the same time taking direct inspiration (and even sound samples) from games like Silent Hill. The story is presented in a way that makes me really want to keep on playing. And makes me hope that I actually can keep on playing.\n\nWhich brings me to why I am not recommending this game, and I will leave it that way until I can determine if this download simply is bugged (wouldn't be the first time) or if the game just really is generally this buggy. Yes, there are a lot of nitpicks that I have with this game, such as the wonky controls, the strange way the flashlight works (it's not like it doesn't make sense, but it just feels and looks awkward), and the general map set up (It's 2D, and if you expect to know where you are, you're going to need to use this map) are problems that hamper the overall game's feel.\n\nBut these are ignorable, just because the story seems very interesting. No, the main problem with this game is the bugs. Holy cheese and crackers Batman, this game is incredibly easy to break. At least that's the way it feels. The first time I tried playing through this game, I ended up getting stuck, and wandering around the same areas over and over again trying to find what I needed to progress. Oddly enough, it was a door that wouldn't open for me. When I tried a second time, it was actually a puzzle that would not respond to anything that I did a little later into the game. Between that, various sound glitches, and other weird occurances, I just  found myself not wanting to play this game.\n\nThe only reason I even decided to try again the second time was because it was brought up by another player in a Top 10 Horror Games of 2014 list. So with that said, I cannot say for sure that this game truly is not worth recomending. I personally cannot recommend it, but if one can't, and nine others can, I say it might be worth giving it a shot if it's on sale. I will edit this review and change the reccomendation to an immediate "Yes" once I've discovered that it was just a defective download. Because while this game is far from perfect even without the game breaking bugs, it's still an experiance that looks like it's worth checking out.\n\nIf just to hear that familiar Silent Hill item pickup sound.","February 27, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I guess you can say I'm tired, too tired to even give a ♥♥♥♥ anymore. Misanthropy can no longer be my companion, nor death my lover. I have seen a lot of things in my life, too much actually. A lot of the bad ♥♥♥♥ has shaped me into what I am today. I'm not actually playing the victim, ♥♥♥♥, with my attitude you couldn't even tell what's affecting me. You know that poker face, but you are actually dying on the inside. Every day it feels like your flesh is being rended, and nothing, not one day thing gets better. If something good does happen, I have to worry about if something horrific is going to occur. For the last four years I have been at a stand still. I go to work, to a job I hate, with a boss I hate, and people who are nothing but druggies, pedophiles and drunks. I have to worry about If today Is the day I am going to get into a fight with one of these welfare cretins and either wind up getting shot or stabbed or me killing someone out of the shear rage I have in my heart. Out of all the years I have been working, I've only met one nice person, and she still lives at the motel I work at, she works at a job where she sees death everyday, and her and her husband drown their pain in alcohol.\n\nNow this is the point where you would normally say, oh wow, you are complaining, suck it up ♥♥♥♥♥ boy, other people have it worse. I know other people have it worse, and I know that things could be worse than what I am dealing with, it's just that I am tired, and I keep trying to reiterate this point to people. I can't live in a facade that most people try to delude themselves into. It's a joke, because most people don't even think about others. For instance, you ever lose a best friend of ten plus years, over some gold digger ♥♥♥♥♥ you warned him about, than have him spread lies about you, and it wasn't the first time he has lied about you, he's been doing it the whole entire friendship. This guy lied to my mother on her deathbed saying we will always be together. Yeah, funny how these things turn out.\n\nThan others tell me to trust again, you have to give people a chance, not everyone is the same, I was optimistic a long long time ago, I would help others at a drop of a dime, I would offer any and all assistance that could be humanly possible. I was used for money, my kindness, my shoulder, and when it's all said and done, I'm alone at the end of the day. Not even my family can comfort me, I hate them. The only people who I adore most in the world are my mother and her sister, my aunt. Every other person In my family I have ever loved is dead and buried. I still live with this pain every single ♥♥♥♥ing day, losing a loved one is not easy, and people who say it gets easier are ♥♥♥♥ing liars, it hasn't gotten any easier all these years. Speaking of the rest of my family, my millionaire aunt, not the one I love, stole my house away from me, she got my senile grandfather to sign a will stating that she would be soul inheritor of the house. So I was damn near homeless last year.\n\nIt's all one big joke, if I can't see the humor in it all, I don't know what I would do. I can only preserver and continue my mundane existence. Or I would say and believe this, if I didn't want to change this, but I do, and apparently antidepressants and stimulants are not going to change the chemistry of my mind. If you haven't seen someone with medication resistant depression now you have, now I'm under the supervision of a neurologist to become their monkey to experiment on. So In closing it is what it is, and if you haven't seen me in a while, it's because I took that vacation to Puerto Rico or Thailand, or at the very least possibly died do to some unknown circumstances. Read this and laugh, call me out on it, do whatever, but know this. I wish for the best for anyone who is reading this, and hope that your life isn't as filled with pain at mine was. This isn't my suicide letter, this is my letter to know that this was the day that I took the first step to changing all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that life has fed me, and if worse comes to worse or I attain that happiness, at least I tried at the end.\n\nThis has been Apostle, may my love for you, and prosperity and good fortune find you in life, and my you attain your dreams. I've been overdue for a break, and this time, I think I'm going to take that vacation, I could use some sun lol.\n\n","January 7","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game supposedly will let you remap that to a button but it doesn't work.   The place is big and side scrolling view is confusing as hell.\n\nSave points too far apart and too few.  It will be a long time between save points and sometimes it very easy to get killed (one shot and reload) and then reloading trying to remember what you have done and where you have been is difficult.  A plain old "save anywhere you want" is sorely needed.\n\nSo far with just over an hour played it is incredibly frustrating.

Claire looked interesting to me, blatant Lone Survivor influences (would that make Claire a homage of a homage?) and all. But the minute I started playing, something felt wrong, empty and shallow.\n\nComparing this game to Lone Survivor or Silent Hill is in some regards somewhat laughable. To begin with, the sound design does not compare in any way to the either of the aforementioned games. What I first noticed, was the mixing of the footstep sounds that were incredibly quiet, there was barely any aural response to walking, which seems detrimental for a game about immersion and atmosphere, detrimental to the projecting of yourself onto the screen. Lifelike animation and sound (or absurd and surreal animation and sound) is vital for immersion and even more so for the immersion in a horror game, without them, you are too aware of the game being a game, and you start to lose touch with it, thereby losing the sense of danger. The light tapping of the steps are overshadowed by the ambient music, also the walking animation of the grown up Claire are naught but two blurry legs switching back and forth with a equally as frantic tapping which I assume are to be the sound of footsteps.   The tense moments fraught with danger and nonverbal screams in the beginning of Claire are boiled down to static and glitch-y “noise-scares” along the generic lines of Slender, this no longer seems to be an effective horror element these days, at least not for me. For the first time ever, I wasn't afraid whilst playing a horror game.\n\nDespite the lack of ♥♥♥♥ in my pants and a relatively shallow soundscape, I trotted along, hoping for some substance or just any indication of something worthwhile in this game, something new, perhaps an idea or new way of expressing something artistically. In other words I remained moderately hopeful. The game does look gorgeously gritty and grungy, the enemy design is simplistic but scary enough, especially the way they gradually break down doors, or how they are placed so that in some rooms they are just just close enough to make that picking of a lock so much more tense. It didn't ruin the game for me, until I got stuck for the first time.\n\nGetting stuck is immensely frustrating, as we all know, you try everything in the area you're in and eventually you backtrack. And this is where Claire destroyed any sliver of hope I had left. Because when I died, even though in the latest save I had explored a lot and seen the blocked passages and the green-lit areas and all that, the red “blocked passage-indicators” disappeared when I loaded the save. Which forced me to go trough the whole area again, just to figure out where not to go. Buuut, since there is no way of getting rid of enemies in the beginning, I kept running in to these monsters while I tried to re-explore the blocked paths, and subsequently died to them, over and over again, having to re-explore trying to get unstuck, over and over again. When I finally decided backtracking wasn't the right answer, I tried taking the passage from the office in the ER, as I had done before, but to my dismay it didn't work. And this is where I quit the game, wrote this terrible “review” and decided to take a break from buying new exciting indiegames for a while.\n\nI'll hopefully come back to Claire eventually, it does seem like a good game, and perhaps I'm just too stupid to progress in games like this unproblematically. I said the same thing about To the Moon though when I got stuck in a weird saving/loading problem in that game, but so far I haven't gotten the moxie to start that playthrough again. My bet is that Claire will sadly enough just be another game in my backlog. But by writing this I hope that somebody that has played this game can give me a reason to play it through and through, because as it stands now, I just don't feel like it.","July 7, 2014","true","2.0"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

The game feels like a side-scrolling version of Silent Hill (especially with the sound effects), and although it isn't all too terrifying, the game makes you want to finish it. Exploration is key in this game due to its nice map system, although as a warning you might not want to explore all the areas as some of them are death traps. The health and sanity are a nice touch, but the game is unclear on how you regain sanity back (try hiding in closets). The exposition of the story however is not the best, since you might still be confused as to what is going on in the story even when you're done. I would recommend getting this game on sale so that you don't focus too much on lamenting on how much you spent on this game but rather enjoy it to its full extent.\n7/10 may play again in the future.","June 12, 2015","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played through the game with the default controls, which consists of: A=Left, D=Right, E=Interaction F=Light/Flashlight, Shift=Run, Space=Jump, I=Inventory, N=Notes, M=Map. If the default control scheme doesn't work out for you or seem kind of unappealing, then there's the option to change the controls in the Options.\nThe puzzles aren't too hard, there are only a couple that are just worth mentioning, the last puzzle I don't think had any explanation, or I simply must've missed it. It consisted of rotating wheels and I passed it by simply turning and hoping for the best. The other one would be the 'Kübler-Ross model' puzzle where you pick the tablets in the following order that makes up 'The Five Stages of Grief'.\n\nThere are a few faults that I've experienced while playing the game. When meeting people, naturally the game would leave a mark on the map where they are. In one case it didn't happen.\nAnother one would be where an enemy somehow hacked past through the wall and while I was on a ledge and technically out of reach from it, it still managed to hurt me.","October 14, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The different characters you meet, the use of young Claire's dream, and the interactive flashbacks is excellent at keeping the player excited for uncovering more.\n\nThe game does bring up some really dark subjects, which I do appreciate, though, it falls short when it comes to the controls. In the length of the game it does become repetitive.\nIt does have a creepy atmosphere, some creepy imagery and a very Lone Survivor'ish art style (which I liked so I'm not complaining). The monsters is not exactly that scary, and the hidding mechanism lacks intensity.\n\nSo it really comes down to if you like the story and/or if you can sympathise with the main character. I myself were able to feel for her and while I thought that the story could use a bit more support from the puzzles and different areas, instead of only a few people hidden around the map (I loved those people interactions, though it just didn't feel like it was enough to keep my attention the whole way through), it sure was an emotional rollercoaster through the mind of our protagonist. I will recommend it to those who think that the story sounds intriguing, though don't buy it for the survival horror part of the game, since that has been done a lot better in many other titles.","August 27, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to menion buggy, with markers either misplaced or missing.\n\nYou spend your time moving left or right, opening hundreds, thousands, millions of doors, and occasionally sprinting away from a monster. And that's it. I can't emphasise how tedious and boring the corridor after corridor gets, and how confusing it is trying to navigate massive levels in that way. It completely deflated my will to continue playing.","December 2, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just about to finish the game, and I'll admit the monsters did scare me at times.\nOver all though i would play it again.","July 23, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reminds me of Lone Survivor but with a lot more Silent Hill thrown in it. Recommend this game but bear in mind a potential pitfall is that you might get lost within the corridors of the various locations. To me it actually contributed to making the game more scary but for some it might be frustrating. The map helps a lot, shows where you are, visited locations and unvisited locations too.","May 22","true","30.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Claire is actually pretty creepy, and scary at times even though the art style may say otherwise. If your still on the fence about picking up this unique gem of a horror game I made a quick little mini- series of it on youtube, just for the reason of showing the game and a bit of the story off.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sDQsf4ZoUo\nClaire is a very interesting game, and deserves a lot more than it has going for it. The downside to this game is that it is pretty hard to find if your not looking for it.","June 3","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
