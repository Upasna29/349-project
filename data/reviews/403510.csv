It should come as no surprise that this is a recommendation. This is your second mission as a Brothers Grimm detective in this Artifex Mundi series. Your mission this time is to  find the last of the giants, defeat him and save the world. You think the Grimm Brothers would help a rookie detective more....\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=595486879\n\nThe voice acting was passable and the artwork is the excellent standard expected of Artifex Mundi. The best art work in this game is in the Magical World locations. My personal favourite artwork location was Moon World but I think this is the best location artwork in Desert World:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=598089753\n\nI did not enjoy having to click continue on my mouse every line in the voice acting. Listening to the cut scene uninterrupted is preferable. Needing to pause the game is the only possible and useful reason. If so a pause button instead of continue is suffice.\n\nAchievements\n\nThe achievements in this title are easier as you can 100% this game on easy, advanced and expert. Collecting all 40 collectibles would of been a good achievement to add. To get all achievements you must play the bonus game. In previous titles playing the bonus game it has been just one achievement but in this game you will be missing four; The Whole Story,  Puzzle Expert ,Master Searcher and One of a Kind.\n\nConclusion\n\nCurrently based on the Artifex Mundi games I have played I feel that this is a weaker entry for three reasons.\n\n1.	The Mini games in this title are on the easy side and I would of liked more .For the more experienced casual adventure gamer you may not find much challenge in this one.\n\n2.	 The game feels like constant Hidden Object scenes. This is because as well as the traditional Hidden Object Scenes there is Hidden Object Pieces  game play in all locations. This means having to find items before you can use them on objects.\n\n3.	The story wasn't as engaging as for me personally. This is really down to a matter of personal taste/themes but I felt like this wasn't the strongest writing.\n\nIf you like the idea of easier game play, 9 Clues :The Secret of Serpent Creek , in my opinion is a better game that I recommend for more experienced adventure gamers even if the artwork in the this game is superior.Despite my criticisms of this particular title I still look forward to trying the first game in this series, the first detective mission, recently released on steam which I will still be making time to play this year...\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/429600/","January 12","true","11.9"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","1"

Previous game from this series is called "The Puppet Thief."\n\nGame Visual/Audio\nThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're nicely done. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGameplay\nThere are three different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual, Advanced and Expert.\n\nThe notebook keeps tracks of the events that had happened in the game.\n\nThere are interactive items in the game, they're marked with a symbol, but sometimes these interactive items do require extra items before they can be interact with.\n\nThe interactive map allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates there are tasks that needs to be done at certain locations.\n\nMost of the hidden object scenes consists of traditional word list and picture items. Some of them do require little or no interaction.\n\nMost of the game's puzzles are rather easy to solve without much difficulty. For most of these puzzles there's a reset button. However, there's definitely a skip button, for all of the puzzles. These two features are only present in "Casual" game difficulty mode.\n\nThere are eleven different achievements to unlock during gameplay. Each of these achievements comes with certain requirements before they can be unlocked.\n\nThere's at least forty decorative egg collectibles in-game, they're scattered throughout the game, most of them can be cleverly hidden in plain view.\n\nSince this is a collector's edition game, there's a bonus chapter, but it can be unlocked only after the main story of the game's completed.\n\nThe bonus chapter continues where the main story had ended.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam’s Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it’s Booster Pack Creator. Badge can be crafted and upgraded with these trading cards. This feature is only available for Steam’s version of this game.\n\nFinal thoughts, I definitely enjoying playing this game all the way through to the end. The gameplay wise is very different from the previous game "Fairy Tale Mysteries: The Puppet Thief." I want to point out in order to&nbsp; clear up some confusion that some might've about this game. Gogii had developed this game completely themselves. Artifex Mundi just published it.\n\nThe replay value I would say for this game is low as in every once in a while. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.","November 10, 2015","true","4.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

I wanted to try this one, published (it's the keyword) by Artifex Mundi on Steam. And you can't see that it's not them that developed it.\n\nYour role is to search who is the hooded man that is trying to bring back giants on Earth (or into that magical world, choose what you want). Based on the fairy tale "Jack and the Beanstalk", you're going to search for beans, guardians, a traitor and a way to save Jack and stop that terrible plan.\n\nWhile the story is good - I enjoyed it, the gameplay only suffers of some well-hidden objects. But that's where the frustration begins. I rarely hit the hint button during a HO game. In fact, I refrain myself to do it in a game with achievements included. Unfortunately, I was forced here to do it because of these needed items to advance in the story. And it's the same for the HO scenes. There is also a lot of objects that need to be "repaired", making you go slower for the achievement where you have to find everything under a minute. You will probably unlock it in a second playthrough, after keeping somewhere in your head their locations.\n\nAnd while the graphics are really correct, though not transcending, I was disappointed in the soundtrack: I already heard it in another HO. Yet, well, it's a good track.\n\nAnother thing with the gameplay is that it's different in the main game and in the bonus chapter. The main game is showing you a list of items to find from a scene to another to build what you need - and these items become clickable when you find the use for them. The bonus chapter is more behaving like any other HO game: you don't need to find that this item will help you to click on it, you can collect it without the knowledge.\n\nWhile I'll recommend the game, I'll advise you to get it with a discount - I don't think it's worthy of 10 bucks. The -40% discount for the launch was already a better price but this game will probably drop lower, so I suggest you to wait until it's 2 or 3 bucks.","October 10, 2015","true","3.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

Lovely artwork and better voice acting than usual for Artifex Mundi. The fractured object puzzles can get a bit frustrating, since the pieces you have to find are usually in plain view, but you can't click them until you hunt around for the thing you need them for. Typical difficulty and length for a HOG; maybe three hours long including the bonus chapter.

As times, it is a bit silly, but for fans of the genre it can be a lot of fun to be constantly hunting for objects.\n\nIn case you're worried, it's done in a way that keeps things very simple indeed. Even at "expert" difficulty, I found this game to be very easy for the genre. Oddly, the bonus chapter falls back to a more traditional hidden-object style. It's quite long, too, almost a game in itself.\n\nThe graphics, voice acting, and music are all lush, and the game engine is buttery-smooth, just as you would expect from Gogii Games.\n\nThe Grimm Brothers branding, though, is an insult to our intelligence. I doubt they would recognize this dumb narrative as a "fairy tale" of any kind. Come on, Gogii! You have a great engine. Stop pumping out this drivel and try to invest in some serious storytelling.\n\nFinally, thank you, devs, for supporting Linux!","February 21","true","3.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The hidden object had specific scenes, but then lots of searching for items in each main map location.  This made it quite tricky compared to most hidden object games where the objects are created into a specific scene.  Here it was very easy to miss items due to them being well hidden in the brush, or other types of patterns background that allowed it to blend in.  Because of this use of the locations for hidden objects there was a lot of back and forth to find all of the items as you couldn't pick up all items in a location until you found the location where the items needed to used.\n\nNot a bad game, though story and music weren't great and I prefer a well balanced puzzle/hidden object type of game than this.  I still recommend it because it's entertaining for the time that you get to play.","January 8","true","19.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And if you're married to other iterations it may initially feel awkward and contrived. Every scene is now a hidden object scene -- the story will not progress until you find the specific items in play. Frustratingly, and as other reviewers have pointed out, there may be objects in plain sight that you know you will want (at some point) to pick up, but those objects will not be available until you open the part of the story to which they apply. Well, you'll just have to come back. Indeed, if you treat this as the casual game that it is, you will enjoy the game flow, graphics and voice acting, and small surprises. This game is clearly about the journey -- which is predetermined, of course, but enjoyable nonetheless.","May 5","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game proved to live up to my expectations and was a lot of fun.\n\nThe story is simple, you're on a quest to stop an evil force from bringing Giants back down to Earth and also save Jack. Jack is a young boy who traded his cow for magic beans, when one of the beans grows into a huge beanstalk he is captured. You proceed to meet the Guardians and aid them on your journey and they help you to stop the evil one and free Jack. With the giant destroyed everyone is happy! The bonus chapter is basically you finding the remaining magic beans so the same thing doesn't happen again.\n\nThere aren't many surprises in the story, even the identity of the evil one isn't a shock. The game play is solid hidden item fare, though items are scattered around main areas for you to find so it all feels like one big hidden item game with a few puzzles thrown in. Oddly enough, the bonus chapter does not follow the same formula, it's more traditional. Either way, it's fun and offers some challenge. Though the game is a bit easy, especially if your a veteran of this genre.\n\nIt's fully voiced with lovely artwork but it's short and easy. It's still a great game and would be a great one for young children. Older players may want to wait for a sale price, however.","November 10, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

There's also an odd inventory system where, in order to do anything, you need to find multiple objects throughout the environment to build any object needed.  It essentially makes the inventory system into mini-hidden object games, and becomes the primary gameplay of the game.  What's strange is that this system is abandoned in the bonus chapter for a conventional inventory system, and makes it feel somewhat arbitrary, as if the game developers ran out of money to program the entire game as intended.   The bonus chapter also features more hidden object scenes than the full game.\n\nIt's not a bad game, and some of the inventory/hidden object puzzles are pretty tough.  But for whatever reasons, perhaps as a result of a rather thin and uninspired storyline, the game feels pretty underwhelming.  It's also a short game.  I have 6.3 hours clocked, and that's for both the main game and the bonus, and a good chunk of that was the game being left on during The Leftovers, The Affair, and Homeland where I wasn't playing the game much, if at all.\n\n5/10","November 2, 2015","false","6.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I don't understand the appeal of the genre, and while I've seen some friends play some from time to time, I never really got into them myself. Then, a couple of weeks ago, one of those bundle websites had a deal where you could get like a dozen of these for the price of however many cheetos you could find in your couch, and I was dumb and decided that for such a low price it would be worth finally checking out the genre myself. If Fairy Tale Mysteries 2: The Beanstalk is any indication, though, I'm going to want my cheetos back.\n\nLike I've said, I've only ever seen people play these sorts of games before, but from the little I've seen I can already tell this is the exact same game. All of these are not so much new titles as they are the same title, again, wearing a costume and pretending it is someone else. You walk around and find hidden objects, solve rudimentary puzzles, and try not to fall asleep. There are really two types of hidden objects in this game: actual hidden object scenes and hidden objects that are scattered throughout the various background environments. Occasionally you will run into something you can't quite get to yet, like a locked chest or an elevated door, and the game will tell you "hey, you need to find the code to this chest, chump". You'll then be shown the objects you need to find to proceed and can go around to all available areas and try to find the pieces you need.\n\nThe problem is neither of these hidden object types works very well. The scenes themselves are fine, but there are only fifteen in the entire game, at least eight or so of which are in the bonus final chapter that is only half an hour long or so. For a game that is a "hidden object" game, there aren't a ton of hidden objects to find. The worst part is the game never does a good job of actually hiding these objects, opting instead to just sort of drop them on the ground and knock off early for a cigarette break. The issue is that after you click on an object, it will disappear to show that you've picked it up. The game doesn't want to just leave a blank outline where it once stood as that would look stupid, so instead what they've done is draw the background first and placed the hidden objects on top of them. This might not sound like a big deal, but sometimes the objects look like they were drawn by a different person at a different time and also they were not aware the objects were supposed to be hidden. I was finding things I knew were hidden objects without even knowing I was looking for them most of the time. I'd get to a scene and go "oh, yeah, I'll need to pick up those six things huh" and then a couple of screen later the quest would pop up and I'd walk back and grab exactly what I needed.\n\nThe story is ridiculous and might as well not even be there. There is supposed to be what I think is a BIG TWIST in terms of who is trying to free the giant, but the game literally goes "HM ISN'T THAT PERSON SUSPICIOUS HMM HMM HMMMMMM" and you're like, well not really, but I guess he is now. Characters show up for two lines before disappearing, and there just isn't any sense of narrative flow at any point in the game. Maybe I'm dumb for expecting a decent plot from a hidden object game, but then what else am I supposed to be playing this for? The puzzles are mindless, the hidden object scenes are easy and bad, and the characters all sound like they are voiced by the first five people they found wandering the parking lot. Even at a reduced price, this isn't worth it.\n\nIt's appropriate that I feel swindled out of my money for a game about magic beans, I guess.","January 27","false","5.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","3","2","2"

When going through the various scenes, som objects were clearly something to pick up - except that is not possible until you got the proper 'quest' for it aka 'gather the required things to do xyz'. Really annoying. Strangely that was not implemented in the bonus story, but by that time I really didn't care much.","May 8","false","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed having hidden object scences with a bit more purpose, and was sad that the bonus chapter was back to normal. However, more puzzles would be nice and just a more extensive main game. I finished both in 3 hours, which is way below my average game time. I would enjoy if there where more games coming with the new set up. It is a bit more involving, which is nice, as HOG tend to not have very involving story lines.\nIf you want a quick game for and an evening or afternoon, this is perfect.","May 8","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The wife plays through them first then I go clean up her achievement missing mess. The steampunk one is awesome, clockwork something...\n","April 8","true","21.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
