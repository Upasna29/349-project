As a result, most bosses can be shot down in about half the time you're supposed to take (or even less depending on your shot type). Also for some reason, pressing certain buttons makes the character shoot in a specific direction instead of my desired direction. I'm not sure if it's due to the strafing settings (I chose the third one) or it's because I play the game with the gamepad/controller. Either way, this NEEDS to be fixed before I can recommend this game again.\n\nUntil these issues are patched out or someone can recommend a solution, I do not recommend getting this game. Sorry.\n\n================\nORIGINAL REVIEW (Recommended at the time):\n\nDiadra Empty is an obscure and awesome free-roaming bullet hell shooter unlike most other games in the recent years.\n\nThe game allows you to use up to two different weapons to shoot stuff, in which you will even unlock more as you keep playing. You are also allowed to dash to be temporarily invincible to cover against most bullet waves and can be used as an attack. Should you get hit by an enemy or a bullet, there's a Defense mechanic where shields you from losing a life once until it recharges back to full. The game also has an upgrade system where you use up gathered coins to power up certain things such as your weapon shots or movement speed. You will definitely be playing this game more times not only to unlock more weapons to choose from but also to unlock other game modes (haven't tried them yet as of this review) and as well as more useful tips in the main menu. There are a few bugs here and there (Results Screen displaying incorrectly is one of them) but none of them affects the gameplay so far. Also, you should NEVER hit the Escape button if you play this game with your keyboard.\n\nThe soundtrack is also pretty good and it blends in with the game's atmosphere.\n\nThere's not much else I can say here and it's extremely hard for me to express the game in words. I'd recommend watching the trailer in the store page to see it for yourself (There are a few gameplay videos of this game on YouTube, but there's also a longplay of it by Rockin' Android if you're interested.). I don't know if there is a demo present, but you're free to explore around to find it. This game was on Steam Greenlight but there was no mentioning of the game's release for over a year. Thus, the game became obscured within the depths of Steam.\n\nThis review may be updated once I've play a couple more times in this game and/or something else happens here.","July 27, 2015","false","2.7"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","1"

I don't even.\n\nGame control 6/10\nPausing mechanism is slightly annoying that you have to use S key to pause instead of ESC key. Which this ESC key directly brings you back to your desktop and results in you staring at your desktop for full 10 seconds and asking yourself isn't ESC the pause key?\n\nGame play 8/10\nStandard bullet hell game, however, it does introduce an upgrade system allows you to upgrade your character's abilities. Since you can only control one character, the game provides you new weapon every time when you level up 3 full levels until you successfully unlocked every type of options. As for game play itself, screen full of bullets and enemies are expected. However, the game uses turbo movement(makes the character move faster) instead of precise movement(makes the character move slower), results in easier to escape from enemies but harder to fight the bosses since it gets harder to approach bosses while avoiding bullets. Overall the game flows really well as a bullet hell game, however, I do not appreciate the game throws three bosses into my face in a row.\n\nUser Interface 5/10\nIt is user friendly, shows all the controls upon player starting the game. However, a major problem is the game provides you the option to use ESC to exit the game and P key to pause the game. This is not really a problem until players realize using ESC to exit the game will not save the player's status. In order to save the status, player is required to use the Exit option in the menu, rendering ESC key completely useless or downright annoying. Art style is enjoyable.\n\nBackground Music 7/10\nIt fits the genre of bullet hell games, which is similar to Touhou project in my opinion. An audio setting option will be nice though, really.\n\nOverall 7/10 Slightly annoying UI\nOtherwise, this game should be a refreshing game if you like bullet hell games or want to try this type of games.","July 22, 2015","true","12.5"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

Below is still the positive review.\nMight just be me, but I found this to be one of the most beautiful SHMUPs I have ever played. It's hard to precisely express what it is about this game that got me to feel this way, but to make an attempt: its atmosphere, music, and story about Nyalra's desperate struggle to be reunited with her sister against a seemingly endless horde of... things, all build up to a powerful experience that should be experienced by all SHMUP fans looking for something a bit offbeat. This game builds a world that sucked me in and brought me on quite the emotional rollercoaster. Mechanics wise it's also fun. There are a lot of options and weapon types to choose from and there's a lot of replayability to be had.\n\nIt's a shame that this game is currently mired with bugs that haven't been addressed yet. Throughout the game I faced the bug that just lets your weapon keep shooting even if you aren't pressing the fire button. I really wish Rockin' Android would fix some of these issues and other issues in other past titles because they have some great games worth playing, but you'll have to deal with issues to play them.","September 29, 2015","false","8.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

An obvious analogue to this is the Touhou series, except imagine that horizontally. You play in a single, large rectangular field with no terrain obstacles, and the ability to face and move backwards. The field does not wrap around, so it's quite possible to get cornered. Fortunately the game provides you with a "turbo" boost that you can use to become temporarily invulnerable, and a handful of bombs (called "Storm Savers") to convert enemy bullets on-screen into cash.  Between rounds, you are given several categories to upgrade your character using coins you gathered throughout your journey. I like that every weapon undergoes a visible upgrade, so you feel like you are getting stronger.\n\nThe story is about a girl, Nyalra who sets out to find her sister whilst riding atop her dragon, Minimi, though you wouldn't really get that unless you looked at the store page or manual. The narrative is told through occasional sentences at the start of each stage and the ending sequence. It goes for a somewhat minimal, artful approach, which isn't really my thing, so I'll just leave it at that.\n\nDiadra is a rather pretty game, if you can stop and appreciate the bazillion bullet patterns on the screen. I haven't experienced any slowdown like I have in some other titles, so that's a good sign. On top of that, Diadra boasts some nice relaxing music, mostly somber piano scores or upbeat electronica. One criticism I have is that the story font is really tiny. The game is always in a 4:3 aspect ratio, which results in side bars on a widescreen monitor. I have to get up close to the screen to read the story text, which is displayed on the screen very briefly. It's hard on the eyes and by the time I realized there was text on the screen, it was usually gone.\n\nThe game offers three difficulty levels. Each must be unlocked in ascending order by completing the previous one. The easiest difficulty is a nice pace. It's not too hard and not exactly a cakewalk either. But after that, the game goes all out and goes nuts with the bullets and enemy health. Surprisingly the difficulty settings set up each stage differently. It's not just a simple damage and health multiplier; more enemies spawn, different ones show up, and more bullets are fired faster. And bosses galore.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what the process is to unlock new weapons and features. I presume it all boils down to "play more", but I don't know how much more they expect me to play. I would have liked the game to explain the requirements for unlockables.\n\nThere's not a great deal of replay value, other than trying to unlock stuff. I rate Diadra Empty a 7/10. It's short, cute, and hectic. As far as bullet hell games go, this is one of the better ones.","October 22, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Some of my thoughts on the game:\n\n- Not quite bullet-hell in the way most may be used to.  Rather than micro-dodging elaborate patterns, you're avoiding the main avenues of fire while shooting the smaller 'chip' shots out of the sky before they reach you.  You have a Strafe that gives you limited invulnerability to break through large walls of fire/enemies to reach a more favorable position.\n\n- Art direction is lovely, although it's hard to make out exactly what some of the small sprites are, haha.  The visual effects can be a problem in the insanity toward the end of EXTRA, but otherwise it's okay as long as you're paying attention.\n\n- The soundtrack is incredible, and the entire reason I became interested in the game.  In particular, 'Nebula', the theme from the crazy-to-reach-let-alone-clear EXTRA Stage 5, has become one of my favorite tracks in games, period.\n\n- As others have noted, the are unfortunately several bugs in this port, and it's unknown if we'll get any fix.  None are gamebreaking and there's a few workarounds, but don't expect to get a good read on your scores.\n\n- There's a lot of customization in your shots.  3 Turbo styles (Hold, toggle, side shooting), fully mappable buttons, 12 shot types, etc.  Some things are locked at the start, and are unlocked after a certain number of cumulative level ups across all playthroughs.  It's also controller-friendly if you prefer.\n\n- Since it's based on macro instead of micro dodging, movement feels a bit too floaty.  You'll also move some on the screen even if you aren't telling it to.  Something to keep in mind so you don't ram a wave of bullets.  Derpy dragons can't hover it seems.\n\nOverall, I recommend you give this a try.  It's not my favorite SHMUP, but it's not one I'm going to forget.","January 1","true","110.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/284220/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","In Diadra Empty, you take the role of Nyalra and her faithful dragon Minimi. You embark on an incredible quest to save your sis-MINIMI? Is Nyalra Dr. Evil? Did she take one look at this dragon and say "Breathtaking. I shall call him... Minimi."? What the heck kind of title is Diadra Empty anyway? Is Diadra Nyalra's sister? Why is she Empty? Maybe the developer didn't want to call it "Diadra is Missing" because it sounds too much like Mario is Missing. Besides, Diadra Empty is a perfectly acceptable nonsense-name for a doujin 2D shooter.\n\nThis is another shmup, and you know what that means; all of the plot is removed so there's room for more bullets. Unlike other side-view shooters, Diadra Empty is free-roaming. If you're using a controller, you're more or less forced to use the analog stick. Oddly enough, it's a sensible design-decision in this game. There will be millions of bullets, but you have an invincible wing-smash move to scoot through everything. You're expected to become attached to this maneuver, because monsters will come from every possible direction. It also helps to keep an eye on your defender-esque radar. Not only does this beauty keep track of you and the enemies, but it also accounts for projectiles, which is absurd but also amazing.\n\nAll you really need to do, in order to finish this game, is maximize your gains. There's a shop in-between stages where you can purchase upgrades. In order to get money you have to kill stuff. It helps to keep your finger off the fire button. Nyalra opts to fire away regardless, and you'll absorb cash from further away. The right combination of weapons is also very important. When you first play the game, your offensive options are pretty limited. As you progress, new weapons, formations, and even special config options will unlock. In my opinion, it's better to focus on raw power. Weapons with a lot of range sound nice, but they're either too weak or slow to do much of anything.\n\nEverything else in this game can be handled with a little practice. The average play-through is about 20 minutes, so you'll have an easy time memorizing what spawns in each stage. Even the last boss and its multiple forms of increasing ludicrousness isn't too bad once you know when & where to wing-smash. It's also nice that the weapon-selection and upgrade paths lend unique qualities to every play-through. Eventually the natural level of difficulty will feel too easy. If that's the case, then it's time to move on to True difficulty. This mode is not to be taken lightly. I went with some poor weapon choices. This led to situations where I had to hide in the corner until all of the big mean monsters got bored and flew away.\n\nIf that still isn't enough, there is an Extra mode. Basically this is where the developer threw a bunch of bosses and enemies together. At this point it's just absurd, with bosses spawning on top of bosses. The final stage is also a serious test of endurance. This mode is accompanied by some awesome music as well. The entirety of the soundtrack is great, but the high-energy tunes in Extra are sublime. It's a shame that the last unlock is a stage select. I guess it's good for practicing - you can set upgrade-levels too - but I would have preferred... well... something else. It just seems sort-of anti-climatic, after all the insanity in the True and Extra modes.\n\nThe real flaws in this game are due to the Steam port. Some issues (like hi-scores not showing up) don't make any sense at all. I was able to trigger full-screen by setting it in the options, then restarting the game, but I've heard of players having other screen-related difficulties. Nyalra is also not supposed to fire all the time. It could be considered a minor problem, unless you're going for the "wing-smash only" achievement, then it becomes impossible to deal with. The publisher mentioned a patch, but they've been quiet for the past few months. The game is still enjoyable regardless. However, If anyone thinks that this port is inexcusable, then they're perfectly right. I'm not too happy about it either.\n\nDiadra Empty is a really good shooter. It has cool ideas, great music, and the balanced difficulty makes for a tense but still very enjoyable game. Unfortunately, you have to approach this title with the mindset that its various port-related issues may never be resolved. Playing for a hi-score is part of what gives a shmup long-term appeal. It's total crap, when the incentive to learn the scoring system is lost due to shoddy programming. Online leaderboards would have been a tremendous addition, but I guess that's a distant dream at this point.\n\nThe game is still mostly playable, but it deserves better.\n\nWell, at least there's always the Desura version.\nWait. What's a Desura?","October 19, 2015","true","10.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
