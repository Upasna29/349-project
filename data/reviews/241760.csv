"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arborday/recommended/241760/","arborday","arbor day","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arborday/","595 products in account","This is a four player co-op game  or a single player game if you are like me and don't have friends, that markets itself as a roguelike, but I'm not so sure I think that's correct. You might be able to get away with calling this a roguelike-lite, or saying it has some roguelike elements I guess, but it sure ain't Nethack or anything close.\n\nThe four playable characters are all a little different, and each have a standard attack, a special attack, and a movement ability. You also have an ultimate power that charges up as you kill things. There's only one of the four that I really don't like, which is fine with me.\n\nThere isn't any leveling up, or long standing character progression. You can earn a currency that you spend to upgrade your character, but the abilities you can pick from are randomly selected and only offer you a pair at a time. These upgrades only last for the current bounty mission you are on, so your character restarts back at square one each time you play. This isn't really an issue, just thought I'd clarify that.\n\nYou can unlock certain kits, which let you give small customization bonuses to your heroes, though. For instance, the medic kit starts you with two medkits. Some kits might start you with a secondary weapon, or various other power ups.\n\nEach bounty you clear earns you points that go toward unlocking these kits, titles, skins, and various things like that. The overall progress is account wide, not per character, which is nice.\n\nThe game is pretty fun, but I can't speak as to how good the co-op is, because I don't have any friends oh god whats wrong with me.\n\nI should also say that for whatever reason, this game runs pretty bad on my system. A lot worse than I'd expect. I have everything on the lowest setting, including res and the framerate is pretty awful. I don't know what the deal is, but it might be something on my end.\n\n","April 7","true","8.6"," 55 of 80 people (69%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","69","55","80","31","0"

The combat is extremely well designed. It's fast paced, but also greatly rewards stategic play, quick thinking, and using your environment to your advantage. It's fun, but also takes a great amount of skill. The enemies are challenging, but their attacks are almost always avoidable (with only a few rare exceptions). The difficulty comes from the enemies having interesting and challenging mechanics, not by simply giving them lots of health and damage. Both the player and the enemies die in only a few hits, making the combat about very careful positioning, timing, dodging and strategy, rather than it being about DPS, armor, gear or any stats. In Kill to Collect, when you die, it's because you made a mistake.\n\nThe combat is so good, that despite most other aspects of the game being nothing special, I consider this to be one of the best games I've played in a long time. It's hard to adequately describe it in words or showcase in a video, you pretty much have to play to understand.\n\nOther things I like about this game:\n- The four characters all feel significantly different from each other in their style of fighting, but are all fairly balanced.\n- It has co-op, while almost every other rogue-lite does not.\n- Basically no time wasted on dialogue, travelling, sorting items, or anything else boring. You will spend 90% of your time fighting.\n- The music is good and suits the atmosphere of the game very well, although like all game music, you'll probably want to turn it off eventually.\n- Daily challenge missions with a leaderboard let you compete with others for daily high scores.\n\nThings I do not like:\n- The aim assist. Although necessary for this type of combat (especially for newer players), sometimes it can be a major liability. At this point, I'd say at least a third of the damage I take is aim assist related, and that's a conservative estimate. There needs to be a button to toggle it on or off.\n- The player base is very small. It can be very hard to find people to play co-op with using the in-game matchmaking. If you want to play co-op, you'll need to have friends, or add people off the forums.\n- The hit detection is host-side, rather than client-side, making it difficult to play with friends from another region due to lag.\n- Currently, due to how the difficulty scales, co-op can be significantly harder than solo.\n- The "Hard" difficulty is exactly the same as normal, except you get only 1 HP. It's definitely hard, but it feels also a bit lazy and causes some balance issues. This problem is not as bad as it sounds though, because most players can't beat normal difficulty.\n- A couple combinations of enemies, or modifiers on certain randomly-generated bosses, can be a bit unfair or frustrating (or at least feel that way). They are fairly rare though. Example: shielded kamibots, or a boss with heal, damage reflect, shield and super teleport.\n\nIn it's current state, I highly recommend this game.  As a bonus, the developers are still adding to this game. They also read the suggestions people make in the discussions, so hopefully over time the list of things I don't like will shrink!\n\nIf anyone disagrees with anything I've said here, or any information is outdated/irrelevant, please leave a comment.","April 17","true","64.2"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","1"

The game is rather fast paced, and focuses upon combat more than anything else in the game.\n\nQuick NoteApparently the game is tagged as Rogue-lite/like which I don't 100% agree with. The game has some elements of this sort of genre but I wouldn't tag it as that, I know that the tags are made from the most popular by steam users but it's just something I had to say.\n\nIntroductionKill to collect is a fast paced, cyberpunk themed addicting game that concentrates solely on the combat but does well with presenting everything else as well. The combat is elegantly designed which has had a lot of thought and process gone through how every move works.  The combat combines fast paced with quick thinking and strategic play in order to outsmart your enemies and kill them easier, the game doesn't rely on how fast you can spam the attack button which is a very good think to have in a game like this. Because who really likes mashing a button to attack with bare minimum combat system? The environment of the game itself is well thought out and presented, you can actually use this to your advantage to kill your enemies easier and quicker.\n\nWith this sort of combat system, it won't be easy. The game seems to take a lot of skill (especially in single player as all the enemies will walk towards you) which definitely would require you to be able to talk to your other teammates in order to get good at the game and be more strategic with your attacks.\n\nThe difficulty of this game comes from the enemies that you encounter throughout each of the rooms that you go in before you get to the main bounty. Some of the enemies are plain and simple, but as you get further into the game the enemies start to develop a more interesting and challenging mechanics that will make the game a bit more harder for you. But the way that they do this isn't like other games similar to this, they are not given tons of health, damage or defense boosts in order to make it difficult. Both you and the enemies die in a couple of hits, this makes the combat system more difficult and makes you focus more upon timing, dodging and careful positioning of each of your attacks in order to make them the fullest and most effective that they can be. You will know when you have made a mistake, because you will be punished harshly with either death or low health.\n\nThe progression with each of the characters that you play as needs a bit more work. It does feel a bit meh and doesn't really feel like you are progressing in the sort of way that you would expect to do throughout the game. I feel like even though there are only 4 characters in the game, that they could of expanded a bit more on the sort of characters that you could of played as. For me, the first hour of the game was me testing out the characters and what sort of combat style there was, and for me personally they all just felt dull and not really that interesting all together. A few more characters in this game would add to a bit more variety to the game I think.\n\nThe game's graphics are so bright and vibrant, I feel like it brings the game to life and really helps with the fast paced that the game is going for. With the cyberpunk theme it really hits the nail on the head for the game all together. With all the characters being fairly bright and colourful, as well as the walls and everything else in the game it really sets a high standard for the game if you're just watching the trailer to see if you like this game or not.\n\nPros+ Elegant combat system\n+ Fast paced and strategic thinking\n+ Nice difficulty throughout the game\n+ Very colourful and vibrant colours\n+ Steam achievements and trading cards\n\nCons- Needs more characters to vary it a bit\n- Smallest combat mistake could lead to quick death\n- For the asking price, it's a little steep in my opinion\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsKill to collect is well worth your time, even though the game itself may be a bit steep for the current asking price it still does well when it comes to the interesting combat and gameplay. The graphics are superbly presented and done, along with the characters. If you can get past the fact that small mistakes could lead up to death or low health, and that the game will require skill then\n\nRating: 8.1/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.","May 2","true","3.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","1"

Often, while you're having absolutely great time. Thats how i would describe Kill to Collect in a nutshell.\n\nThis has been a great year so far and we've seen plain awesome indietitles after another and this one for me ranks among the best i've tried. Game itself can be played either in co-op mode or as a single player mode and both includes three difficulties and three modes to choose from. 4 Different classes who all have their own unique skills and playstyle.\n\nThe gametitle might already be a bit revealing, but yeah, your objective is get the bounty done, which means you have x- amount of floors to clear before\nthe bossbattle, and thanks to the roguelite-aspect, if you die at any point of the game, you're forced to start from the first floor and there's variety\nof different enemies that wants you dead at any cost. For the daring there's even added Challenge rooms which yields extra number of rations that you can\nuse on the saferooms to upgrade your skills before venturing forward. These are levelbased and will reset if you either die or complete the contract.\n\nThe game's mechanics are fairly simple to learn, you have 2 basic attacks that you will be using, ability to dodge and 4 slots where you can collect any drops that will boost up your chances of making it out alive. That said it's still fairly easy to make fatal errors.\n\nThe detailed steampunk world and perfected soundtrack/audio are topnotch and i enjoyed both, (Especially the soundtrack) tremendously.\n\n\nBut i would say that this game as fun as it is, relies heavily on co-op, and thats how it should be played. For it's price it can provide fun for you and anyone you're playing with for a long period of time. Kill to Collect is just that addictive.","April 8","true","11.6"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","19","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/241760/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2518 products in account","NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================\nKill to Collect is a single- and multi-player 'rogue-lite' action game in a dystopian cyberpunk setting.\n\nYou play one of four bounty hunters who spend their time delving into the deeper floors of Earth's last city, Geoshelter Alpha, in search of their prey. And when they find them? Well, they kill to collect, obviously!\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - The graphics all have a great cyberpunk-like feel to them, with dark backgrounds combined with bright neon and flashy weapon effects, and the character outfits, while mostly looking a little silly, fit the atmosphere well. Enemies are a little bit boring and samey across some levels, and are basically made up from two groups: robots and humans.\n\nThe graphics are a little small, though, and with no zooming available to focus in on the action, I found it difficult with some enemy models to see the animations clearly enough to predict their attack timings.\n\nGraphics options include the usual detail level, full screen / window mode, and resolution settings, as well as a number of advanced features like SSAO, bloom, and antialiasing. I played in full HD with everything set to maximum and experienced no problems on an aging gaming laptop (485m video card), but others have reported some issues on much newer hardware. The developer is looking into it, but from my point of view, it runs like a dream!\n\nSound - Music is nice enough: a sort of heavy rock-type beat with electronic melodies. In any case, it fits the game well and doesn't get in the way. Sound effects are similarly good.\n\nGameplay - The game has three different gameplay options, each able to be played in single player mode or cooperatively with up to three other people: Story Mode (a campaign, including a minimal tutorial), Challenge (fight your way through eight levels as quickly as possible), and Free Hunt (do any bounty, without the story mode's extra story bits). Ultimately, though, each mode boils down to the same thing for each level: descend to a lower floor of the city and fight your way through room after room of bad guys until you come to the boss: your target. Then collect your bounty.\n\nThe game structure within each bounty takes a room-by-room approach that is similar to other games such as the Binding of Isaac, although with none of the unique encounters of that game. Each floor consists of a number of isolated rooms, and enemies from one room can't travel to another. You progress by wiping out all the enemies in a room, after which you can unlock the door to a connecting room and do it all again. You're rewarded on completion of each room with 'tech', one of the game's two currencies, and you receive a bonus if you complete a room without getting hit by an enemy. When you reach the final room of the level you're awarded some food stamps, the other currency, and can then spend your tech and food stamps on random items that only last until the end of the current bounty.\n\nOccasionally you'll find chests in some of the battle rooms, which can be opened to reveal random one-use items or temporary weapons. These are fairly few and far between though, and are usually (always) found in 'challenge rooms': rooms with a much higher number of enemies than normal rooms. Upon completing one of these rooms you can open the chest and grab the loot inside.\n\nWhen you complete a bounty -- and also if you fail at it -- you receive a reward for the number of kills you made through the level, with a bonus for killing the bounty target. This then adds to your progress in various 'loadouts' (equipment with which you can begin a level), titles (simply a name), and outfits for your hunters. There is thus some limited customisation and progression available, but it's a hard slog for what seems like not quite enough of a reward.\n\nIt's fun to play, although it is more frustrating than it should be, as dying in single-player mode seems to take you all the way back to the start of the first floor of the bounty, even if you've reached one of the end-floor rooms that is supposed to respawn you there. Because of this it took me over an hour of play just to finish the first proper bounty after the tutorial, because I had to do the whole thing about seven times.\n\nA few niggly issues brought the game down a bit, though. For starters, the game is essentially a twin-stick shooter using left hand on the keyboard for movement and right hand on mouse for aiming and shooting. But the default keyboard and mouse controls just don't work in a frantic situation, as they make it impossible to use items like medkits. Unfortunately it's not very easy to make it better with the choices available for keyboard configuration, either; I've only managed to improve it slightly by mapping the middle mouse button. The game does claim to have full controller support, which would probably work much better. I haven't had a chance to test that yet, though. The mouse aiming also sometimes doesn't work quite right, leaving your character swinging off at some weird angle well away from the direction of the mouse pointer. The lobby and menu interface is also a little quirky, with a bit of searching required in order to work out how to activate or use any rewards you win.\n\nThe story in the game is enjoyable, if a little derivative, but the text really needs a bit more attention. There are some very awkwardly worded sentences that just don't flow well, and numerous grammatical errors as well. The four characters all have different background stories and in-game abilities, but without extra characters to open up or more customisation and progression available, it feels like it's not quite enough.\n\nI say Kill to Collect is a 'rogue-lite' game as it includes random dungeon generation, and some degree of random drops (although in this case they're not enemy drops, but rather sporadic chests and end-of-floor shops with random equipment), but it doesn't include any of the mega-loot options like a true rogue-like game. There is only very limited character modification available, and mostly only temporary progression.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ A great atmosphere; a good cyberpunk feel\n+ It's great fun most of the time\n+ Single player and cooperative multiplayer\n+ Achievements\n+ Trading cards\n\nCons:\n- Keyboard and mouse controls don't work well in frantic situations, which are common\n- It's very frustrating sometimes\n- Most character upgrades are only temporary; a permanent upgrade tree would be a fantastic addition\n- No one in multiplayer yet\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Re-reading this review it looks as though I'm being a bit down on Kill to Collect, but that's just because it's almost fantastic; it just misses out due to those little niggles I mentioned.\n\nBut it is still a very good fun game. I highly recommend it.\n\n8/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","April 9","true","8.7"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","12","24","5","0"

I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes, but I found myself feeling like 80% of the game was missing beyond that.  The lack of character progression is a major flaw that I feel like takes away from the game.\n\nThe combat is incredibly unforgiving, and even on easy with two veteran gamers we were struggling to make it through the first two levels.  You don't feel like you are accomplishing anything, and you're not rewarded for moving on.  It's like the game may strive to be something that is difficult, but there isn't any real challenge - you're just prohibited from getting hit more than a couple of times each level - which really prohibits the ability to run around and have fun and causes the game to be mostly centered around dodging minor ranged attacks beacuse only a few hits and you'll be starting the level over.\n\nThe medkits restore 1 health point, out of the 8 or so that you have.  Taking damage is pretty much something you can just not avoid to do.\n\nThe first bounty ended with a boss fight stating she had the "Super Teleport" ability, which meant she just hopped around the room.  It wasn't any different than any of the standard rooms had been before, and left me feeling totally underwhlelmed.\n\nHaving convinced a friend to buy this game so we could play to together like we had "Meltdown" or other rougelike or dungeon cralwers and neither of us could stand it at all.\n\nMaybe with additional development and some major changes the game could be worthwhile, but as it stands - I wouldn't bother.","April 9","false","1.0"," 22 of 48 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","22","48","0","6"

You have 4 characters you can choose from to use, each one has their own unique style and play fairly different from eachother.  There are secondary weapon pickups that you can find in the levels or purchase them from the shop, they have limited ammo and can only be refilled by picking up ammo cartridges.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly fun and interactive.  You get to move your character around and attack enemies.  There is some skill involved where you have to learn the enemy attack patterns and fight accordingly.  But most of the time you're just kiting enemies and counter attack with a slash.\n\nAlso I would like to mention this game is a "rogue-lite".  If you die in a level you have to start over from the beginning floor and you also lose whatever items and power ups you purchased.  Also after you beat a level you start from scratch again in the next level.  But there is permanent progression after each death or passing a level you get exp/credits, these go towards unlocking character skins and titles.\n\n\nMy only gripe is the pacing of the game, it is kind of slow.  Imagine MOBA-like movement, but you're actually controlling the character manually so everything feels like slow-motion, sort of.  I'm assuming this was chosen because they wanted combat to be more "tactical", but I feel there are other ways to go about this.\n\n\nFor hours:price ratio, if you can look past the slow-pace of the game you will definitely get your money's worth and much more out of this game.  But I feel though the full retail price is too much for the current game, I would wait for a discount.\n\nOverall this is still a good game to have in your library collection eventually.  The combat and characters make it very fun and you just want to come back for more.  I hope this review helps you decide whether to purchase the game or not.","April 8","true","13.6"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

You're in control one of four Hunters and your goal is to clear out multiple levels out of any enemies you'll encounter. Invite your friends, create a team, think of some good strategy and... Kill To Collect!\n\nAdvantages\nBig variety of enemies\nLayout of levels is randomly generated\nAwesome soundtrack, perfectly fit to the theme of the game\nGreat replay value thanks to all unlockables and customization options\n4 characters to choose from, each with their own unique set of skills and play style\nThe difficulty is hard and it makes the game more rewarding than it looks like\nUp to 4 players co-op mode is well made and lets players think of some nice strategies to pass the levels\nDisadvantages\nThe story is really not clear or even visible and doesn't bring too much into the game\nIn story mode, game can be too challeging, which might lead to being stuck\nEdit: When one of your co-op friends disconnects / looses connection with game, he automatically leaves the game with no possibility to join back until the game\nEdit: Chat window only appear after opening it, it doesn't show up after new message\nSummary\nI'm really into this game right now. Yeah, it is a bit repetitive if you're dying over and over again on the same level, but it's quite rewarding when you're finally able to get to the next lever. The main theme of this game, along with music, totally bought me - cyberpunk to me is the most amazing thing that could ever happen to games. Thanks to big amount of ways to combine all boosts, upgrades and weapons, ensures us that we won't get bored of it too quickly. The only thing that I wish to be upgraded, is an amount of playable characters or at least some additional skills to use. But except that one thing, it's a really good, I could even say, a great game, I heavily recommend it, even if it's for single player only. So yeah, now I'm going back to finish another bounty and hope one day I'll finally git gud and stop dying.\n\nPersonal score\n8 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","April 6","true","9.7"," 43 of 96 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","43","96","3","21"

You finish floors by going room to room (kind of reminded me of Dungeon of the Endless) and kill the enemies inside that room. Since you only have a very limited amount of hits you can take and not a lot of chances to replenish it, you have to be very careful when fighting the very varied enemies. Tactics and timing is absolutely necessary to succeed and this is where the fun is.\n\nThe four different playable characters allow interesting combos with each other to kill enemies faster which is necessary on harder difficulties and levels. Kill to Collect combines this with randomly generated elements and and a credits reward system even when you fail which makes it all that more addicting.\n\nI can absolutely reccommend the game if you like a challenge and the idea of a co-op rogue-like interests you.","April 8","true","23.5"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

(Ask my girlfiriend... it's a creepy sight to witness).\n\nI realy enjoy playing throw the roguelike and twinstickshooter genre alike and love games like\nNuclear Throne, Enter the Gungeon and hyper light drifter, which are great games, so when I realized\nthis has been able to up the gameplay even more it came as quite a surprise to me.\n\nHighpoints:\nthe controls are slick meaning you have no useless keys to use, just 3 for standard attack, one cc ability and your Ultimate, 1 dodge and 4 consumable slots and they are spot on in the responsivity department.\n\nthe AI in this is so darn fitting, caster avoid you making it hard to get rid of them first, Ranged units kite you, all of them avoid area dmg from environmental hazards. The different enemies have such a distinguished set of behaviours making every room a unique challenge.\n\nYou can use the rooms against the enemies and feel smart about yourself,\nthe first time a purposefully threw myself into a pit, hanging onto the ledge to avoid a bounty bosses spinning attack, then jumping back up and cutting him to pieces... I felt great.\n\nthe sound is great, ability and impact sounds are well done.\ngiving you exelent feedback, when an attack is coming etc.\n\nand the graphic and physics in this nail the feeling of beeing a skilled contractor doing incredible stuff, into place.\n\nThe only room for improvement i see is,\nin the worldbuilding, the feel of the world so to speak could be stronger.\nmaybe add the ability to walk around in the bounty bar and talk to ppl in there for some banter ( stay awhile and listen ).\nto make everything more coherent.\n\nand little things, like a toggle for aimassist.\n\nI shall finish this with a big thank you to Pieces Interactive for making this Game and thus making me\nvery happy , so thx guys!\n\nP.S.: I apologize for my rather weak formal abilities when i comes to writing in english.","April 18","true","15.7"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"

So no matter how long you play, you dont get progress, you get cosmetics. (Very slowely mind you)\n-And for F**KS SAKE there is an enemy that kills you with a single hit. No matter how much health you have or how fast you are. He locks onto you and in the frame of less than 3 seconds he hits you with an unavoidable lazer that KOs you. It is a nasty run ender and is completely broken BECAUSE HE HAS TANK HEALTH. Its just a dumb enemy with no challenge, just more cheap damage.\n\nOther than that the game is alright. I like it myself, but I wouldnt recomend. Buy this game when its DONE, or close to. Wait a few updates and see how it is. When youre not getting cheap hit or getting 1 hit KOed, its an amazingly fun game. It needs a lot of work. But every great game did at one point. I really apreciate that the campain is done and that there are leaderboards. There's a lot to love and a lot to question but I say keep this game in mind. It is fun when you get the hang of it. The reason its fun is BECAUSE its hard. Its not artificial difficulty, its really challenging and enjoyable to play. Its still in the works so i'd say pick it up while its on sale and maybe see if you like it. I know I like it.\n\n\nLong story short, pick up this game.

I coud never call this a masterpiece, a work of art, or stuff like that, becuse this game is something... both small and, as I already said, not really new, but also perfect in what it is.\nFirst thing, there's basically no plot, but that isn't a big deal, the setting is well put and straight to the point: It's a cyberpunk world, you are a mercenary, a runner, call it as you like, we want some crooks killed, here's your target, this will be your reward, go get them!. And BAM! You are in this map, killing things to open the way to your wanted criminal, no wasting of time, just fun.\nIt's a top-down shooter with a skill-based gameplay which reminds MOBA games, and it is hard. Marvelously hard. When someone says It's hard about a top-down shooter you imagine a bullet hell, but this is not the case, the gameplay isn't erratic, everything is clean, solid, and accurate, if you play it at Hard difficulty as an enemy hit you, you are basically dead. If you smash the buttons you die, if you don't take care of your positioning you die, if you don't notice a threat you die, if your mom screams something at you, you die. You can use a lot of different tactics to clean a room but when you do a mistake you lose. This will change if you play at Normal difficulty, of course, you will have more health and there'll be room for mistakes, so the game allow you to chose the kind of experience you want.\nEverytime you'll die, you'll have the feeling "I did that mistake" and you'll get better, the game is clean, it's not chaotic, there's no fate involved, no RNG mechanics, the game never cheats, it just requires skill and this makes it such a rewarding experience.\nThis is a roguelite kind of game, when you die you restart, but it's based on short missions, as I said, so you unlock the new mission after completing the previous one, then you can select the mission you want even if you die. Anyway the maps are randomly generates, so it never feels too repetitive to restart a mission. Anyway, it's hard, and after you die, and die, and die multiple times in a row, no matter how hard you tried, it drains your energies, so, speaking about how I feel after some playing, I could want to stop after 2, 3, 4 hours I'm playing... uhm... but maybe it's not strange in any case? By the way, I could want to stop playing this game after some time, but that doesn't last long, this game is something you'll want to come back to.\n\nConclusions:If you are not a bad person and you like chocolate, you will like this game. If you usually like top down shooter, roguelite games, or just beautiful games - yeah, there are people who like bad games out there, check your facebook - you will love this, and if you have someone to play it together it will be great.\nSo just buy this, the price is fair, and if you don't like it you can still ask for a refund and I'll owe you a beer in our next lives, just don't die too soon.","April 20","true","13.2"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","23","3","13","3","0"

I'll shortly list those before I do an in depth review.\n\nAs an aside, I'm not sure if I have to clarify that I was given a review code for this game because I was given one of four from a friend who needed to test out the co-op aspect. So, I did that.\n\nPros: Game in absurdly fun.\nMusic is great.\nThe enemies are varied and creative.\nVery nostalgic.\n\nCons: Difficulty is dodgy.\nLevel design can be confusing.\nOccasional bugs and wonky hitbox detection.\n\n\nI'll do the Pros first since this game deserves that much. First I'll give a quick rundown of the basic idea.\n\nKill to Collect is in essence a dungeon crawler. You splatter your enemies across the wall and floors until you find an elevator to the next floor and do the same process. Don't let that trick you into thinking the game has no depth. It has an passable cyberpunk storyline but the gameplay is honestly why we're all here.\nAt the end of each floor you can spend two types of currency you gained from that floor. Credits are awarded for performing well in the rooms and are used to purchase consumables like personal shields or more secondary weapon ammo. Food stamps are an oh so delicious reward for completing the various challenge rooms through the floors and are used to buy semi-permanent upgrades for your character. Anything you don't spend is saved for the next floor, and after clearing every floor in an area you're thrown into either a boss fight or a few waves of enemies. Once you clear that, it's on to the next area in the story.\n\nThe game is absurdly fun: It's absurdly fun! I have 14 ish hours by the time of this review and about 12 of those are in\nco-op. The characters are all interesting with different movesets for varying playstyles. Each one has a Basic Attack, a Special Attack, an Ultimate, and a Mobility move. On top of that, they each have a unique trait incorporated in their moveset to further cement their 'role' in the party.\n\nMusic is great: The music very well done and atmospheric. Atmospheric may not be the correct word but it helps me personally get in the cyberpunk mood. Although it isn't something you'll (likely) be whistling at work like Zelda or Final Fantasy, the music is appropriate and on point with some bumping techno music for one level, and crunchy guitar music on the next.\n\nThe enemies are varied: Every area you enter has it's own flavor of baddies, with some levels catering specifically to a certain type like a robotics uprising having only robotic enemies in that area. Outside of those special occasions you'll encounter a pretty range of enemies from punks with axes and laser pistols, to robotic drones and large mantis like robots with claws. You may notice a few palette swaps to indicate enemies with AI but more never hurt anyone.\n\nVery nostalgic: This is the point I most wanted to emphasize because I haven't seen any other reviewers mention this specifically. The game is almost over the top nostalgic for oldschool dungeon crawlers like Gauntlet or most prominently for me, the Loaded and Reloaded series. I see the word Roguelite being tossed around but I feel that's doing a disservice to this game based on the amount of trash 'roguelike' games being pushed out lately.\n\nAnd now the cons. I'll reiterate that I played this game when it was technically in beta, but I've continued to play it after the full release and these are the problems I see still persist.\n\nDodgy Difficulty: There are currently three difficulty modes while I write this review. Easy, Normal, and Hard.\nThe difference between easy and normal was literally imperceptible to me outside of beginning with slightly more HP.\nThe difference between Normal and Hard however is like night and day and may deter anyone from ever trying it out.\nOn hard mode you have 1 health point to begin with, and close to everything will kill you in one hit. Learning to use your weapons effectively is paramount and is what I consider to be the way the devs intended KtC to be played.\n\nConfusing Level Design: This one is tricky because it could very well be just the group I played with.\nThe literal level design is very simple and straight forwad with every floor being comprised of a series of rooms, roughly square shaped with different floor hazards like pitfalls or robotic turrets and vats of acid.\nThe real problem stems from the questionable color choice on some the floors and enemies. Very frequently my friends and I would find ourselves in a situation where the enemies and floor would be so similar in color that you couldn't tell anyone was even there until they killed you. In particular, it's the red flooring and red enemies that caused issues for us.\n\nBugs and hitboxes: This is easily the most frustrating part of this game for me. The hitbox detection felt so on point for many of the bad guys I encountered, but a couple in particular seemed to be wildly innacurate. In particular the little robotic probes and the sword and shield guys. There are times when you can easily be outside their range and still be hit by their attacks. It's especially frustrating on hard mode since that death can feel very cheap.\nThe occasional bugs weren't terrible but should be mentioned. On the loading screens, we would occasionally lock up and have to Alt+F4 out and restart the game.\nThere is another bug where your characters will seem to magnetize to one another and go launching off at breakneck speeds wildly. It caused a few deaths and can lead to you trying to avoid working together and just clear a little corner of the room each so you don't get too close to one another.\n\nI know I said I'd try and keep this short, but honestly Kill to Collect is firmly one of my favorite games to play now and I had a hard time not rambling about how great it is. If you liked Loaded or Reloaded, give it a shot.\n\nOh, I don't know how to format on here, this is my first review. Sorry if this posts in a weird way.","April 8","true","14.2"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

There are challenge rooms with more difficult groups for more rewards, at the level exit you can buy upgrades for your heroe, more attack power, speed, faster skill reload you know the drill. The controls are very smooth, if you learn the enemies attack patterns you can go on and on without loosing a bit of your health bar. Your heroes have 1 direct attack skill, a special skill like stun and an ultimate. All 4 available heroes play different. The grafics look nice, more comic style, the music is excellent. Your level upgrades are not persistent, they are lost when you start a new mission. You can get permanent perks for credits earned by the missions. Those are starter kits, like more medipacks or some power ups when you start.\n\nYou can play online with up to 4 players. No local coop.\n\nIf you like twin stick arena shooter like smash tv, this is a very good addition to your collection.\n\nHave a nice day.","April 8","true","4.0"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

BG:DA is one of my all-time favorites, so that's a great thing! You must avoid taking damage at almost all cost, so you need to master dodging. So practice solo a bit before joining the fray, and you'll stay alive much longer. Don't expect a story-heavy RPG that allows you to out-level and out-gear the enemies - this game is pure skill.","April 8","true","3.1"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

This is a colorful yet violent game with an interesting world that takes you deeper and deeper below ground.\n\nThe good stuff is focused on the core gameplay: It feels nice to shoot robots in the face with a shotgun, to dodgeroll out of danger and use all the abilites at your disposal to Kill each boss on your hitlist. The soundeffects also help sell the core feel of the game.\n\nThe things that could be improved on are things like the tutorial which feels uninspired and disconnected from the rest of the experience. I also thing that the enemydesign and upgrades could use some work, since they feel like they have been mostly copied from other titles instead of going in the same direction as the rest of the game. Having a dystoption setting with lots of color is really cool, I wish that there was a better synergy between that and the upgrades etc.\n\nOverall Kill to Collect is an entertaining game that shines brightest if you play it for fun with a few friends over Skype. It can be very hectic, adrenaline fueled and entertaining all at once.","April 8","true","4.5"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

If you enjoyed the newer reboot series such as "Double Dragon Neon" or "Gauntlet", you should definitely check this out.\n\n"Kill to Collect" is an isometric beat-em-up.  The four different characters play very differently. Each mission is procedurally generated.\n\nPlaying on Hard difficulty level, I cleared the first mission. The second mission has different adverseries. Hard difficulty is super hardcore because you start off with 1 hp, so perfection or near-perfection is required. I found myself swearing at the screen many times.\n\nIn addition to Story Mode, there are procedurally generated, daily challenges, which you can take part in, to see if you can make it to the top of the Leaderboard.\n\nYou need to use a controller, since it is very difficult to hit diagonals on a keyboard.\n\nI love the music, I just wish that there were more music tracks. The dialogue made me laugh a few times.\n\nGameplay video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWDhWoQBpvk\n\nI think that Kate Katana is hot as f*\n\nI could not find other players to play with but hopefully that will change with more reviews:\n\nhttp://steamcharts.com/app/241760","April 8","true","19.7"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"
