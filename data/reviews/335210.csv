The voice acting is mediocre at best and there is no solid gameplay. The animations in the game are poorly done, for example, the fire "spell" cuts off immediately as soon as you lift the button, and there is no level structure. You can visit a few places with no context of where you are. This feels like it truly is still just someone's project for fun and not polished enough to even be on Steam.\n\nI regret this purchase.","December 13, 2014","false","0.4"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","27","44","0","0"

Wish I could get my $10 back.\n\nFirst the good about it:\n- It can be pretty in parts\n\nThe bad:\n- Horrible voice acting, controls are bad, you won't know what to do almost all of the time and get lost / frustrated.\n- Motion Sick? Not all the time, but with jerky camera movements and some bad fly by camera area's you will get motion sick.\n- Don't buy this game, this is an example of bad VR.","February 3, 2015","false","1.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I really dont understand the bad review. Is an exploration game!!

The centering of Oculus doesn't work so this causes issues right from the start. Movement is awkward to say the least and, after less than 10 minuets in the game graphical artifacts occluded my view so much that I just gave up and quit.\n\nI wish I didn't spend my money on this and it should be considered pre-alpha but, I do hope that it improves because some of what I saw looked good.\n\nI'm gameface so I will be uploading a video of my playing experience for others to judge for themselves.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZF9rrVv8Tk&list=UUMc9vxo5NN-yMIkAecJ87Bg\n\nGameFace","January 31, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I do have an antique stereoscope ... and a viewmaster, you'll understand in a few.\n\nPro:\nLooks great even on crappy settings\nI managed to get 3D (ish) in a Holmes & Viewmaster scope .... suck it technology.  OK it was painful and probably not realistic for most people\nVery good potential\nLooks like crapple people can run this as well ... now for penguin people?\n\nPush:\nVery early in the early access - lets hope this is still being developed in a year's time\n\nCon:\nNot much of a game, more of a walking sim at this point.\n\n\nOverall:\nYikes, how do I rate this game?\n\n5/10 (+1 looks, +1 VR, -3 alpha early access) = 4/10\n\nIf you have the hardware and want to be part of the early access, there is no question get this.\nOtherwise, give it a few months and try then.\nI hate to do this but as of today I have to give it a very small thumbs down. I'll check back in 6+ months and hopefully things are more beta than alpha.\n\n\nFrost Earth Studio: please put up a demo if you get the chance. Many of us are wary of EAGs (and for good reason since there is a lot of crappy EAGs on steam).  I think if DK2 owners could get a taste of the game they may be more likely to buy.","May 25, 2015","false","0.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","0"

When a new title on Steam announces it has VR support, I normally investigate and see if it will work with the DK2 (Yes, beware as Valve is too incompetent to properly label VR titles; you must do your own verifications in order to make sure the game actually works with VR, even if Steam says it should... it may very well not - Steam just want to take your money)\n\nWhile this title worked virtually perfectly with the DK2, content-wise it fell short. Very short. Don't get me wrong, it looks fairly good in there (fairly, not incredibly... I was more impressed with the visuals in Frontiers) but it just doesn't seem right. The scales are off, the LOD lacks and as a showstopper, some basics like camera clipping values are wrong.\n\nI stopped my run when I recognized something I learned in Unity on day 1: I could see a big diamond-shaped hole in the skybox. So we didn't change our default Oculus camera rig values. Hum. Quit.\n\nI regret this purchase. I find it alarming to read things like "must own for DK2 users". Your bar must be so low in the must have dept.","May 26, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
