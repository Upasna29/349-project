I have not logged a lot of play time, however I have watched a few tutorial videos and have learned that this is not a gap in my understanding of rules/controls, but is in fact how the game was designed to be played.\n\nFundamentally what bothers me about the game is the fact that you are not building consistent trade that develops and grows over time. Instead every turn the resources demanded by planets and the prices are re-rolled, and all your convoys from last turn are removed, and you basically have to plan things from scratch. This is enjoyable for a few turns but quickly becomes tedious, especially with larger empires. It is frustrating to invest five minutes thinking through an excellent trade route, only to have it removed the next turn (and with no way to recreate it). Not only that, but it removes an element of long term strategy from the game as I do not expand based on optimizing my current trade network, but instead expansion is best done through a simple greedy algorithm (grab the best, nearest planet every time), since the world will compleltely change next turn.\n\nI would accept the fact that you basically start each turn from scratch trade-wise if the controls of the game made it very easy to set up new trade (and the only difficulty being thinking through and optimizing things - aka the fun part!). Instead everything from the camera control (the game would honestly be better if they scrapped the whole planetary system thing and replaced it with a board game style system with no third axis of rotation to mess the view up), to the ui/menus (no way to see what the second resource a corporation wants to trade is - you can only see the resource it wants that turn, you need to zoom in to see text after clicking on a planet, and the tooltips are awful), to setting up trade (watch a tutorial: even the devs have trouble clicking back, and trade, and travel, and figuring out what the hell is going on). The single most frustrating aspect is the system of fleets, which mean that if you are creating a very large trade route, and you have almost finished it, but the last planet you want to visit doesn't have enough fleets (or fuel or whatever) to visit, then you need to undo the ENTIRE trade route, then add fleet to the planet, then redo the entire trade route (being able to add fleet while making a trade route would help here). It feels as though the game was only tested on tiny three planet systems, and the devs didn't bother to see how controls work with larger systems.\n\nMy two main issues compound to make the game unplayable for me. While I would personally enjoy creating long term strategies over the turn-by-turn optimiziation the game instead asks for, I understand how this system can also be fun and challenging, and was willing to give it a shot. However with the aweful controls, having to re-think everything turn-by-turn makes the game too frustrating and slow to be playable.\n\n","December 22, 2015","false","1.5"," 49 of 52 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","49","52","0","3"

The problem is that it's not even a 4x, more like a 3x. It lacks exploration...\n\nWithout any fog of war, you can see everything about each planet at turn 1.  Disappointing...\n\nLets talk about the combat system, its basically an uninteresting card game. It goes painfully slow and you can't really skip it.\n\nManaging your trade routes and ♥♥♥♥♥ can be fun for a while, but the whole experience is underwhelming once you understand how the game works. Possibilities are too limited, you either are doing it right or not. You can't just play your own way, and try something different in a next game. You are going to learn how to play and then realise that it's always going to be the same, more or less, each game. Add to that the fact that there's only one race for you to ''choose'' from..humanity.\n\nI have 6hrs of playtime on Apollo4x and I would not say that I regret purchasing it, but I am not going to play anytime soon. Not when Gal Civ3 and StarDrive 2 are around... I say buy it if you are still curious about it but otherwise that's a Not Recommended.","May 19, 2015","false","6.0"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","32","38","0","0"

Rather than building large warfleets as in most games, trade is the key to victory. Colonized planets provide 3 resources which must be sold to other planets. The more planets, the more money. Unfortunately with more money also comes factions in the planet-state that'd like their own cut of the pie and ancient Centaurs which serve as the main external antagonists to the game.  To defeat the local dissidents, just throw them a few bones here and there and they'll bother someone else while ignoring them can cause a lovely coup as they decide your rule doesn't serve the planet's 'best' interests. If you cater to their needs, you may just unlock special abilities that can save your skin when the Centaurs decide your worlds would like better in their possession. Combat involves recruiting a balanced ground force and picking the correct tactics as you go against four different kinds of enemies, each with different tactics on each unit.\n\nPositives:\n(+) Uniqueness - Apollo4x seeks to breathe in a new formula to the tried and true 4x. Rather than being an Alexander the Great, the player is a Machiavelli leading a planet-state to economic glory.\n\n(+) Beautiful Ground Combat - The background and combat cards have this archaic look as if it was from a 90s adventure game. For most games it might seem an odd choice of graphic design but Apollo4x executes it extremely well. Ground gameplay forces you to recon the enemy tactics used each turn and then designate the appropriate countermeasures. There's enough challenge each turn that you can't just use the same formula over and over and even if you 'figure out' one race, there's 3 others that would like to meet and have tea with you.\n\n(+) Domestic Options - There's no direct budget you'll have each turn. Instead you'll be forced to pay in terms of resources to answer the numerous complaints various Apollo factions have. Answering more requests will provide the approval and 'clout' that is used to gain new abilities and use those abilities, respectfully while ignoring domestic issues will eventually cause a Glorious Revolution. Glorious may not represent what happens to you as the leader though...\n\n(+) Multiple Victory Options - If peace is what you want, then peace is what you can have by building a galactic stellar net or becoming the undisputed economic powerhouse. And if war is what you want, then by whatever god you worship, go burn your enemies' worlds to the core.\n\nNegatives:\n\n(-) Lack of Tutorial - While the manual is indeed well-designed and explains everything, the lack of an ingame tutorial does require new players to make an active effort to learn the game mechanics by going back and forth from the manual and the game with a little trial and error.\n\n(-) UI / Camera Scrolling - The sin of 4x games has always been in the UI. While it's not horrible, Apollo4x's interface is a bit clunky and awkward. Camera scrolling on the galactic map has you right clicking between planets rather than a more simple WASD setup which serves to be a small nuisance.\n\n(-) No Multiplayer - I really hope this can be added in the future. The game has serious multiplayer potential that needs to be exploited.\n\nVerdict: Despite having to fix a fridge, the house is in great shape. The gameplay works well and is plain fun. The Devs are a great bunch of people who are passionate about the game and working on fixing the few minor bugs and then expanding the game further.\n\n8 dead centaurs / 10\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor those who want to see some gameplay: https://youtu.be/ERwi-8yEMbI\nChannel Link: https://www.youtube.com/user/xBr0wnBear\nIt's a long video but it covers all the basics and I've attached timestamps for various sections of gameplay.","May 6, 2015","true","3.5"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","17","24","3","0"

You have an interest in Space 4X? You like the many Space Trading Games? You enjoy games like Magic: The Gathering? You actually crave games that make you think?\n\nIf you have answered yes to one, or even all of the above. You owe yourself to give Apollo4X a purchase. Yes, I am saying that right away. Why? Because all the aforementioned is in this game and then some! But now, you are probably thinking..\n\n"Oh great, another game genre mashup that just will not work!... I'll Pass!"\n\nHold on... Not only are each of these elements solid in their own right. But in Apollo4X, they come together to make a super solid, unique and rather innovative title that shouldn't be overlooked. As a 4X game, you will not do something, then mash the turn button waiting for something to do. Each turn has strategical depth. You must meet colonial demands, purchase resources, build up colonies, prepare and plan for trading.\n\nTrade is not an option in this game. It is one of Apollo4X's core mechanics. If you do not trade, you will go bankrupt, and you will lose the game. No population building leading to masses of taxes here. You have to be strategically aggressive in your interplanetary business, as the more you expand, the greater the upkeep. Colonists Empire-wide will also make demands. Ignore their demands, you suffer loss of approval rating and if that hits 0, you will also lose the game.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, there's the Alien Centaur threat to deal with. They are aiming to take over the whole galaxy, and most importantly, take you out by capturing your home planet of Apollo. Whilst their are no space battles in the game, land battles are played out as a card game. This game has a fantastic strategic complexity as battles are not one on one. Each card will affect several others in a deck. So what you select, and the tactics you choose in how to play them matters. So even when you are outnumbered and outgunned, it is still possible (But not easy) to win a battle.\n\nSo after some 1st impressions. What are the pros and cons?\n\nPROS\n\n- Starting the game, maps are not final. Feel at disadvantage?  Just don't like the map? Throw it out until you find something you like.\n\n- This game has depth from the start to the end. You will not be hammering the 'End Turn' Button. Gameplay is engaging and there's always plenty to do. Strategy is key, you will have to think! A strategy that works in one game, might not work in another.\n\n- A genre mashup that actually works. There's no 4X like it. Apollo4X is truly a unique and innovative game that pulls you in!\n\n- One more Turn Syndrome? You bet! The game is fun and totally engaging.\n\n- A welcome 2D galaxy option for those who require it.\n\n- Many options before starting a game can potentially serve up lots of replay value!\n\n- Your purchase will be helping to save rescued dogs... Good bang for your buck in both game and charity.\n\nCONS (Can also be positives for some, including myself)\n\n- Although not a disavantage by my standards. This game takes the old school approach. There is no tutorial mode. You will have to read the manual. Understand, and pay attention to what every section of the UI does. The learning curve will be steep at first.\n\n- Maps can get busy fast, and initial confusion might arise. There's a lot of information to react to every turn. Turns are not quick, and neither is mid-late game trading and combat. You will not finish a single game in just a few hours.\n\n- No storyline or campaign. Just the old school way to play. If you're looking for 100's of random events, and a story to follow. You will not find it here.\n\n- A few very small issues here and there which will be tightened up with a bit more community feedback.\n\n\nTL;DR? - An innovative 4X game that dares to be different from the normal formula, and as first impressions go, it suceeds! If you are looking to buy something different, buy this game!","May 6, 2015","true","12.0"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","15","22","2","0"

No need for spreadsheets. There are very few different commodities whose prices changes every turn. That forces you to redo your trade routes again and again, at least until you get the mechanics of investments. Also you cannot spend an infinite amount of money each turn (diminishing returns, remember?) so after a while you don't need to trade anymore. That's a good thing.\nThe combat mechanics are a bit complex and very shallowly explained. But once you get the hold on it is interesting. I've been just reloading savegames to test combat strategies. And only tried one race.\nI guess the game can easily provide beyond 20 hours of solo entertainment for a fan of the genre.

But to me there is just too many polints against it I just can't let go.\n\nFirst of is the strategy; once you figure out the "puzzel" in how to play the game well, it largely devolves into doing one key strategy to gain profits and resources to further expand and conquer better than the AI. That's only half the puzzel - the other half is figuring out its somewhat complicated card mini-game it substitutes for combat phases. It does have some itneresting promise, but its back into the solution formula - once you figure it out, that is what you do.\n\n4x (or maybe 3x here? no real exploration in this one) style games often hail to high standards on having options on how to do things. This game has a very rigid set of how to play. It is interesting, it does have promise - but to me, its just not in the right category.\n\nThat is what irks me the most. Its not very flexible on its approach, its a one-off goal to expand and exploit with an over-arching goal to exterminate (or win by other means before your own demise) and that to me is a bit misleading still. There really is only one or two good ways to solve this puzzel game, and very little deviation to it.\n\nIt just feels shallow I guess, I was expecting more - or perhaps a bit more leeway on how to get around the annoying card combat.

No explanation of how corporations work or how they relate to the planet $ values which also aren't explained.  No useful tooltips.  No in-steam manual and the link to the manual on the company website is dead.\n\nMight be a good game I guess just no way to find out.","May 7, 2015","false","0.4"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","10","27","0","2"
