There are very limited visual settings and gameplay options.\nThe graphics are decent for such an old title, but the gameplay is really unpleasant and simply not fun.\nYou control a character in a boat, shooting a bazooka style weapon at blocks, trying to match colors and generally clear the screen in a time limit.\nThere is also a battle style game where you match colors and use weapons against each other but it's really nothing special.\n\nPros:\n-Bright colorful graphics, decent music and sound effects\n-Lots of puzzles if you actually have fun there may be a lot to do here\n-2 player local competetive\n-Supports Steam Overlay\n\nCons:\n-Gameplay is incredibly boring and unusual. Controlling a boat while aiming and avoiding attacks from above is not fun.\n-No Online Multiplayer, No Steam Achievements, No Cards, No Fun.\n-Character design is lame compared to other worms titles.\n\nI'm not a huge puzzle game fan, but the few I have played have been much better than this.\nDon't buy this game at full price, and if you get it in a bundle you may quickly find it to be a waste of time too.\n\n\n\n\n","October 25, 2015","false","2.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","4"

I regret that).\nThis really shows - many Ubisoft games that used lisenced franchises like Disney or other big names at the time often had significanly lower quality in-comparison to their own IP's while also putting a 'spin' on whatever popular game mechanics were being used for these 'outsourced' titles (I.e. a Donald Duck themed Crash Bandicoot with a modified health system ran poorly and is easily beaten by the 3D Rayman titles).\nUbisoft's 'spin' this time is the momentum of your movement being mixed with Worms (tm) weapons to create a clunky puzzle game that has the main difficulty being setting up your 'answer' to the challenges that it provides instead of the actual puzzles themselves.\nAlso, Worms games don't even allow users to move when aiming - it feels counter-intuitive to the original franchise too.\nNot reccommended unless the clunky-2000's style appeals to your rose-tinted nostalgia glasses.","March 5","false","0.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is not exactly made for single player.  Of course,  you can play on your own here but I thought the fun factor of this game was much higher with a friend playing the game on same PC.   About controls, I think this game benefit better with a gamepad rather than keyboard which was what I was playing with.\n\nI have this game in my library from the Worms' humble bundle.  I think this game in the series was quite underwhelming compare to other games in the series despite the different genre of this game.   If you do not have any games from Worms' series and are looking into this game, I would suggest you look else where for similar kind of gameplay.  Unfortunately, I would use 7.99 price tag against this.  It is a bit old game that did not age well.  I felt 4.99 price tag at most would have suffice.\n\nMy rating:  if single-player, I'd say 3.5 / 10.  With a friend for fun, as high as 6 / 10 at best.","December 13, 2013","false","30.4"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","1"
