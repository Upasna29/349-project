No.\n\nEdited for additional info: before you say that maybe it was intended with playing a controller, all a controller can apparently do is turn the ship and use the afterburner. Maybe jump as well. It doesn't work when you're inside a station where it requires something to press its buttions. You NEED a mouse or a touchscreen monitor to play effectively or at all.\n\nThe map in the game is very...simplistic. That's the kindest description I can give it. Last I saw, it was as if it was drawn with bright red and green crayons.\n\nIf you ask why you need the mouse for manual combat, well there's the fact that there's a button for the unguided lasers that you must click once for it to auto-fire. That's right, auto-fire. Which drains your energy bar that also supplies power to your shields and auto-repair systems if you get damaged, which by the way, can have thresholds on how much you can heal and such. If not for the tutorial repair, I would have been dead already in my first fight.\n\nYou also need the mouse to turn efficently at the same time as doing it by keyboard is kind of slow and unresponsive and it feels awkward holding a controller with one hand and a mouse in the other to do it. Think about that. No way to effectively dodge in combat normally, if there was any ability to dodge at all let alone aim the manual auto-fire unguided laser, so you must use the auto-combat system to get things done.\n\nAuto combat? It's where you first target an enemy ship, click on a button twice that makes it automatically use whatever turrents and missles you have so you watch and do nothing as either you or the enemy ship dies. You may have to then manually change the enemy and turn it back on again.\n\nEither the developers are pulling a bad prank with shoving the IOS/Android in here as I deleted the game and re-download the game to check and the size was 556MB (Not something that required 2GB of harddrive space that was listed) or this is the real thing.\n\nSeriously, This is not a good choice to buy, let alone try to play at the moment. Until they fix such things, I can't seriously recommend playing this if you enjoy the space genre. I'll hopefully check back in a month or two, but by then I'll probably play some other game worth my time and effort in.","December 17, 2014","false","3.0"," 456 of 555 people (82%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","82","456","555","12","21"

It's been out for years and finally arrived on steam.  It's a shame Elite moved their release date up to match this game....not sure why they'd have done that.\n\nNot as pretty of some of the newer games but a solid story and enjoyable gameplay.\n\nPeople will have to ignore the majority of reviews though.  The majority were posted by people who didn't take 5 seconds to get the facts.  For example they think this game was developed after Elite when the fact is Dangerous was released with that name over a year before Elite was even in the 'Being thought of stage'  But fanboys never look at facts.  No this isn't a Elite Dangerous cloan, nor is it an attempt to market off that game...in fact if you only went by the true facts then it's the other way around...if you base your findings using the same scale as most of the other reviewers.\n\nNow more about the game.  You can in fact fly planetside which is nice, the devs have talked about adding new planetside content later.  Controls are simple but at times a little painful and I wish combat allowed a more hands on approach.\n\nI'm still playing the game and I'll edit my review to add more information as I get deeper into it.  But I felt the need to call out the majority of negative reviewers that only posted because they have no real idea what they are walking about.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdated after a few more hours.  I'll admit I enjoy a more first person view but RTS type games can be fun.  I will say that there are things the Dev could have done to make this a little easier.  The game can be a pain during the first hour or so until you really get into the controls.  I also think the 'Tutorial' is a tad slow.  Usable and it works but the pace is a little slower than I'd like.  Also I've learned that the game leans on automatic for the most part.  You will not find yourself driving the fights that much, mostly clicking on one of the 'Automatic' options and just watching.  While that's normal for a true RTS this isn't that and it tends to make things too easy.  Would like a better challange.","January 18, 2015","true","5.6"," 137 of 266 people (52%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","52","137","266","21","31"

What I don't like are the controls that on the one hand don't offer enogh options and on the another hand are too complicated or confusing. While the game's tutorial tries to show you around (and quite well succeeds in that even, I enjoyed it), it didn't manage to teach me how to fly the ship. And since none of the many buttons have hover text, I wasn't able to learn by myself. If the memory load (player's, not computer's) could be lessened, I would like the game much more and probably would even continue it.","April 23","false","0.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Those who have made a negative review may not be considering this and the fact only two people are working on it.  You should give this a chance, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  The music is good.\n\nThe different beam and pulse weapon graphics are beautiful.  The ship is third person view.  You can gain perks through playing the game by doing jobs for the various companies.  You can even start with a perk at the beginning of the game.  You are given a subtle training lesson in the form of sudden battles which you are aided by your rescuer, thus also gaining some credits and XP to spend.  After that you can do what you want with the few objectives to help you on your way, including getting your own and first wingman.\n\nYou can choose your own direction in earning credits & XP even Piracy, or be a Merc. including Bounty Hunting, or trading or as an explorer of the Ancients.  The universe is your oyster, be its doom or saviour, its your choice.\n\nBefore I forget, you can make your ship better or buy a better one and make it what you want to suit your playing choice.  There is much to do, space battles to fight, credits & XP to earn and a purpose to fulfill with your own mysterious AI to help you.  Enjoy Discoveries and so on.","August 8, 2015","true","2.6"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","20","39","2","0"

This time my review will be honest. I absolutely would recomend this game to anyone, The controls are certainly a learning curve for me but It is a fun game nonetheless (not sure if one word) it is a great game. My favorite being the humor in this game, it has me laughing to myself almost everytime. Fighting honestly is not easy but it is fun and innovative, for me at least. I do not blame them for the same name, i do not believe that the creators puposely did this to get money, as Elite:Dangerous was not public knowledgeat the time of them starting the creation of this game. Once again i am sincerely sorry for my previous review. Thanks for the great game.\n","June 23, 2015","true","4.6"," 25 of 49 people (51%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","51","25","49","7","0"

Controls take a bit of a learning curve, it reminds me a bit of Eve Online. Seems to be a solid game open-world space game. I definitely don't see reason for all the negatives.\n\nThe one thing that bothers me is the pirates seem to be endless and without any real rhyme or reason to their appearing. Even in core sectors I get random pirates showing up on my butt while trying to do stuff like cargo runs or mining. And every mission I inevitably have random pirates show up. But this is a thing I've encountered in a lot of games like this, so while I find it a bit annoying it seems to be the norm.\n\nI don't see myself playing it past the storylines much, but it's providing good entertainment so far. I recommend it if you can catch it on sale. It's available for Android and IOS too (I have the PC version, so I can't comment on the quality of those).","November 10, 2015","true","15.8"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","0"

Just don't.\n\nFollowing may be a bit sarcastic: Hit button on hud to start laser firing. Hit button again to let it stop firing. You wanted to fire weapons with mouse? Nah, clicking on hud it is. Changing controls on startup (10 positions mybe) differs from VIEWING controls in menue (30 Positions) in game. Customisation is as overated as making, what the others do. Mouse over information? Why? The hud has 30+ icons hidden in several sub menus and unique and mostly new logos which mostly don't look like the actual function, so there is no need to have a mouseover.\n\nI almost died in first mission due the controls, only the repair of the instructor ship saved my live during the 10 minutes, where i tried to understand, why my weapon does not fire, why i view my ship from a distance of 5 kilometers (wrong cam) and why the control sheme deviates from expectation and entered things. The controls alone kill the fun of this game.\n\n@Devs: Try to make, what other do, instead of atempting to develope a whole new revolutionary control sheme.","November 7, 2015","false","0.5"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"
