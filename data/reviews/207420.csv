I love the graphical style and I enjoy 'Breakout' type of games; I was hoping that this would be an evolution of them. It's not. It's slow and monotonous.\n\nYou begin in a broken town. In order to rebuild you must go into the dungeons, earn money, and donate it to the townspeople. The dungeons are different environments such as a forest, castle and mine; all are presented beautifully in an elegant SNES anime style. The style is so pretty in fact that it was the main draw for me to buy the game.\n\nThe gameplay is close to the classic Arkanoid/Breakout games. You have a paddle at the bottom of the screen that keeps a ball bouncing around on the 'table'; there are bricks on the table you must break which hold gold and various powerups that help you, or conditions that weaken your paddle. Once you break all the bricks with the ball: you win the level. If you let the ball fall out of the bottom you lose a life, once all lives are gone you restart the world unless you buy a continue with the gold you're using to rebuild the town, or buy items. There are also stores in some of the levels, bonus areas to get extra lives and items, and spells that help you speed up the process of breaking the blocks.\n\nThe problem with the game is that it doesn't deviate from the Breakout formula enough; so if you've ever played one of them then you've played a very close version of this game, and it has similar problems.\n\nOnce you've broken most of the bricks in a level, the ball tends to just bounce around missing the bricks that it's been missing since the beginning of the level, especially the bricks in the corners. This is supposed to be solved with your spells which allow you to change the angle of the ball mid-movement, a fireball spell that lets you shoot up from your paddle, and a few spells that allow you to set the ball where you want. They work for the first dungeon and that's about it. In later levels there are unbreakable blocks, blocks that take many hits to destroy, and barriers that slow your progression through levels to an eye-gouging crawl.\n\nIt's just boring. If you've scrolled to the bottom of this review for a score, it's boring/out of 10.\nI wish I could tell you that the graphics are enough to purchase the game, but it's just a bore.\n\nPlease don't waste your money or time.","January 19, 2014","false","6.5"," 94 of 134 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","94","134","0","2"

It is one where the distinction between recommending it and saying it isn't worth it is hard. The visuals are very nice, considering they are done by paul robertson, this is a given. The gameplay itself is where the issues fall. You have magic powers, such as the ability to teleport the ball or control where it floats. While these powers are nice, the game is incredibly difficult. Blocks which need to be broken are almost always behind unbreakable objects and the further you venture into the game, the more often this occurs. If you enjoy a challenge and like brick breaking games, go for it if this game is on a good sale. I enjoyed the challenge of the game so I give it my approval, but this game is definately not for everyone.","July 11, 2014","true","7.1"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","36","45","0","0"

You play as a mighty Wizard who's immense magic power seems to transform him into a...stick. Well, a paddle. Seeing that his next feat of insurmountable power is conjuring a little floating orb, this isn't as useless as it sounds.\n\nThe game at it's heart is a breakout style brick breaking game where you rebound a ball using a small paddle you control into the targets until none remain. Although there are a couple of spells such as engulfing your ball in flames to pass through multiple blocks or subtly altering its direction with a breath of wind, they really don't do all that much to change up the game and crucially, don't always stop you from the dreaded 'last brick standing' challenge of rebounding around the level for a few minutes until you get lucky enough to hit that last, stubborn brick.\n\nYou're tasked with helping a small village rebuild as you venture out and defeat monsters and destroy targets of varying shapes and sizes (I'm not quite sure what great threat a bush is to the already destroyed village, but its your task to crush them into leafy pulps!). The highlight to the gameplay is the boss battles, which is a neat little twist that see's you fighting a much tougher enemy that has a few skills of their own - it's just a shame this sort of thing wasn't the norm, as other enemies simply act as mobile targets.\n\nI played the game with a mouse (the clicky kind, not the squeaky kind) and found the controls to be smooth and responsive, although I did get a slight stutter now and then - nothing that impacted the gameplay, but it did come close.\n\nIt's hard to recommend Wizorb to all but the biggest Breakout fans as it just doesn't offer that much compared to other brick breaking games, despite the wonderful presentation. If you're a fan though, its a fair price for what's on offer.","March 10, 2014","false","5.3"," 34 of 51 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","34","51","0","0"

It's pretty decent, but like other games in this genre, the devs like to design maps where your powers are of limited use (typically placing blocks behind indestructible objects), and thus you spend several minutes trying to get that one last block.\n\nThe graphics have a charming old school 8-bit look, and are well-animated. The music is... forgettable.\n\nThe speed of the paddle is defaulted to 1. I highly recommend changing that to 3 when starting, or you will quickly find the ball outpaces you. Even then, it doesn't move fast enough.\n\nDespite being marked as having full controller support, it didn't recognize my PS2 controller, but Joy2Key solves that, as usual. You'd think mouse control would work well, but for some reason the paddle actually moves slower than using a keyboard, thus mice are less than ideal.\n\nI think the biggest problem with the game is how much potential was wasted. It presents some cool RPG-like features like walking around in town and gathering cash to buy stuff, but most purchases do little for you. It would have been awesome if you could gain levels and gain permanent items, and actually feel a gradual progression of becoming stronger. But as usual, one death and you're back to square one. And of course there's the near non-existent story.\n\nThe best quality of the game is perhaps how inexpensive it is - less than $1 on a sale. Is it worth it? Well considering I finished in about an 3 hours with little replay value, it's... hard to say. If I had more fun I'd easily recommend it. I'd be willing to bet I could find, or even make a Breakout clone that could hold my attention better.","August 22, 2013","true","7.7"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","0"

It's miles better than most pixellated wannabe-retro indie games nowadays.\nHowever, while it wears the RPG design on its sleeves, it's all merely eye candy.\nYou visit a single tiny hub town serving as little more than a place to shop for items, talk to every person once and be done with the RPG side of things. Gameplay-wise Wizorb is 95% Arkanoid/Breakout and 5% RPG. At most.\nUnfortunately, the paddle action isn't the tightest either with some rooms taking a dreadfully long time to complete.\nThe magic system is neat with its fireballs and gusts of wind, but it runs dry quickly by giving you all options very early in the game. Maybe they should have saved some spells for later.\n\nFor the low price the developer is asking for it might even be worth a quick shot for diehard fans of the genre, but if you're here for the RPG aspect, don't bother. Also, I hate achievements that turn into huge grindfests. While I did get 100% achievements within a couple of hours, those last few hours had been spent with repeatedly grinding for money.","November 2, 2014","false","11.6"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","25","37","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrismaticRebirth/recommended/207420/","PrismaticRebirth","PrismaticRebirth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrismaticRebirth/","777 products in account","Introduction: Wizorb is a Breakout style game that combines the familiar gameplay of Breakout with RPG elements. How does this interesting combination work together? Quite well, actually. While there are apparent flaws in the game at some moments, as a whole, Wizorb is worth playing.\n\n\n\nGameplay: While RPG elements are present, there is no real "story" to speak of. Simply put, you're a Wizard who uses paddleball magic to defeat monsters. Neat! By earning a high score and defeating enemies, you are awarded with gold (GP). This gold can be used to purchase extra lives, help the people of Tarot Village, and charms - such as triple balls, a magnet, double damage, and more - that are lost upon death. Gold is very plentiful in the game, making affording these things practically a non-issue. While this is not a flaw, it removes some thinking from the game.\n\nWhy is this game called Wizorb? There are also magic elements. You can cast fireballs to help kill monsters and destroy blocks, summon gusts of wind to direct your ball, and set your ball on fire to add penetration. Unfortunately, I largely ignored these mechanics as I did not really need them - there are no stages or puzzles that require clever use of magic, they merely make the game easier. You are limited in your magic use by a "mana" pool, preventing the game from getting too easy. There are missed opportunities to fully flesh out the use of magic in this game, however is is still a fun and innovative system.\n\nThere are four worlds in the game each containing 12 stages and a boss fight - there are additional bonus levels besides this. Each of these worlds carries its own theme and introduces new blocks and enemies.\n\nThe stages are - for the most part - well designed. I felt as though the later stages became too long and had too many invulnerable blocks, though it was still enjoyable. There are a few "cheap" things in the game such as instant-death, however they are sparse enough to not ruin the enjoyment too much.\n\n\n\nArt & Graphics: The game's art style is very pleasing to the eye. It takes inspiration from the games of old, giving a pixelated look. This means the game has / will age very well. The enemies are pleasing to look at and fit the theme of the game; the bosses especially are very well designed artistically.\n\n\n\nSound: As soon as you click a button on the main menu, you'll be met with a satisfying sound that gets you ready for the game. A classic RPG-esque sound plays whenever you damage an enemy, and the Breakout "dink" sound plays when our ball hits a block. While none of these sounds are amazingly designed, it all fits the theme of the game spectacularly.\n\n\n\nReplay Value:My playthrough on Normal took about 4 hours. However, earning a high score on a level awards you with a star ranking for that world, giving something to work towards. There is also a Hard difficulty, achievements, and an in-game leaderboard.\n\n\n\nPrismatic Complaints: I have very few annoyances with the game. However, you can only have one save file at a time. If you complete the game on Normal, your save file will be completely deleted if you want to play the game again on Hard difficulty. The game may also be difficult to get used to initially, especially if begun on Hard, however I do not consider this a real issue.\n\n\n\nClosing: While it has its flaws, Wizorb gives a very interesting take on the standard Breakout gameplay. Each world was fun to play with each level being a joy to get through. I highly recommended Wizorb to Breakout fans and non-Breakout fans alike.","April 6, 2014","true","18.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Precise mouse control with left- and right-click is clearly a superior option to two-speed digital control, but the UI makes no reference to mice, instead displaying either keyboard or controller buttons. The music is droning and repetitive and doesn't stop if you alt-tab out. While these various quibbles aren't dealbreaking, the game clearly feels like a 90s era console game, but doesn't really take advantage of that fact.\n\nOn the gameplay side, hitboxes aren't nearly as clear as they should be for a genre that demands precision. Boxes, for instance, only have hitboxes on the top portion, as the ball is effectively floating off of the ground. This is probably the biggest dealbreaker, especially where enemies are likely to hover near the bottom of the level and liable to send your ball careening in a seemingly random direction.\n\nIn all, Wizorb feels like a poor PC port of a mediocre Xbox game.","November 30, 2014","false","2.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","1"

They're a ton of fun and there's something 'zen-like' in their simplicity.  These types of games work well for me, in that I can zone out, turn the brain off and it serves really well to make me concentrate on that keeping that little ball moving when I need to tune out.\n\nWizorb fits the bill quite nicely for it's $1.49 sale price.  Heck, it would suffice at its full price of $2.99 if you Breakout and Arkanoid are your thing.    The game play is the same, move paddle, bounce your balls, break blocks.  Wizorb gives the formula  a bit of spice though by adding in magic elements and a quest mode where you try to rebuild a city.  Heck, there's even boss fights, which is a pretty cool change.\n\nI'll be honest...the RPG elements are largely kind of pointless.  You get fireballs and 'wind' that doesn't do a whole heck of a lot.  The village bit you're saving up to rescue?  You'll finish that off right quick.  But, that's okay.

Most of the time.\nI disagree with the "casual" tag on this game. It's one of the more difficult Breakout-type games I've played, requiring very precise aiming in the later levels as well as when there's one block left that you need to break, nestled between unbreakable blocks.\nThe level design is also very unforgiving in the later stages, and if you're a score chaser you need to finish each level set ("world") in one sitting or you'll lose your score.\nSo if that sounds like your kinda game, read on!\n\nWhat I enjoyed\nA beautiful old-school feel to the graphics and audio.\nSolid block-breaking play.\nThe game is enhanced by adding an upgrade shop in most levels.\nSpellcasting helps you shoot blocks, guide the ball and more. There are more spells than you might think; check the in-game help for a full list.\nThere are varied themes for the levels grouped into different "worlds" or regions that you access on a map.\nIn between missions, you can spend your gold to help restore a village and receive rewards, as well as equip for the next "world".What I didn't like\nIn the later levels, too many unbreakable blocks are placed in rows very close to the paddle, leading to very fast bouncing back and forth and more chance of missing the marble. This is artificial difficulty and just unfair.\nIf you go back to the map without finishing a "world", you lose all your progress in that set of levels.\nIf you save and quit the game, your level progress in the "world" is saved but your score is reset. No idea what drove this decision. It prevents short play sessions. We don't all have time to sit through a whole level set.\nRelated to the above progression issues, there is no arcade mode that lets you jump into any level you've previously completed. You have to go through the campaign.It's difficult to decide whether to recommend this game or not. And you'll see the other Steam reviewers saying the same.

Within the first few seconds of playing it, you'll get it. The early levels offer plenty of time to experiment and learn the rules naturally. It is truly rare to find a game released nowadays that's willing to be as straightforward as this; as elemental.\n\nIt's Colorful\nThe color palette, foreground and background graphics, and even interface evoke a bright and fun fantasy world. Every last bit of the game matches the theme, drawing the eye in. The look feels very cared for and very complete. You might see a game advertize itself as having pixel graphics, as if a stylistic choice itself were a selling point. Here, the pixel graphics are good not because of affectation, but because they are good. Here, it works. Here, it is complete.\n\nIt's Cutthroat\nThe difficulty levels feel appropriate, starting with a casual floor and going basically as high as you dare. Because of the simplicity of the rules overall, even very difficult settings and high speeds are still fair. There are two places where this breaks down (out?).\nFirst, there are times when the colorful graphic effects for a block fading out are so obtrusive as to completely mask the position and velocity of the orb: those sole qualities of player interest. The blocks turning into fireworks when they die is cool at first, and becomes an unfair challenge when they hide the orb.\nSecond, monsters in general are poorly thought out, and boss encounters in particular run counter to the basic game elements. It would be nice to have a way to figure bosses out ahead of meeting them, especially when they have some dumb gimmick that makes them more than just "hit this moving target with the orb six times." Suppose the smaller enemies in the stages leading up to the boss had a similar gimmick. You could see it in action and then know what to do when you meet the big one. This basically doesn't happen. It's a shame, as boss monsters serve only as a sudden, unfair guessing game and a means of delivering larger-scale animations to the eye. We have plenty of the second already and need none of the first, ever.\n\nIt's Short\nEven with the dumb boss monsters I had a blast, and wanted the game to be about five times as long as it is. There are in-game reasons to revisit stages, and the score-attack ladder allows a perfectionist to sink hours into getting a lucky rebound on any given stage. Not exactly to my taste.\n\nIt's Good\nBuy it. Wizorb is absolutely worth what you pay for it on Steam. I missed out on a sale price on it and I didn't care. I'm pleased as punch that a game of this kind can exist in 2013 and we need more games like it.\n\nGraphics are good.\nSound and music are good if you like chiptunes.\nTheme is complete and evocative.\n\nSomewhat short.\nCertain enemies are unfair.\n\nNow excuse me while I go work on a module for Dungeons & Dragons that turns me into the Wizorb wizard.","December 26, 2013","true","6.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

At first it was novel, but now it's getting a bit old --- Anyways... despite that, this is still a fun little game for fans of the genre.\n\nFor those who don't know what this type of game is, you basically move a paddle at the bottom of the screen left and right, hitting a bouncing ball back and forth towards the top of the screen in order to destroy various types of objects and enemies. You also have the ability to use a handful of power-ups such as shooting fireballs from the paddle and slightly altering the course of the ball, among others. The game consists of 5 worlds comprised of around a dozen levels each (which makes the experience only 3-5 hours long, unless you are a completionist). Between levels, you can also visit a sort of "hub town" where you talk to characters and help them out by giving them money. It's a neat side aspect of the game, but really doesn't offer all that much to the core experience other than a little background story and a few extra items and achievements. So unless you are down with the core brick-breaking gameplay, there's nothing much else here to recommend for you.\n\nThe game was well worth the small asking price for me. One of my favorite games as a kid was the original "Breakout" for the Atari 2600, so I have always had a soft spot for these brick-breaking style games. If you aren't a fan of that style of game, then nothing about Wizorb will change that. However, if you've enjoyed games like that in the past, then this will definitely give you a few hours of solid mindless fun.","December 12, 2012","true","5.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

If you don't like breakout games don't buy it. If this style of game intrigues you, read on.\n\nThe main part of the game is broken up into levels of breakout games. There is a story about saving a village and you only really need to pay attention to that if you're an achievement hunter. This is more of a side-story than anything.\n\nThe gameplay is good as far as breakout games go. Broken up into several worlds of about 12 levels each, offering differing setups and enemies. It is static however, so on any replay you will get the same levels. There is a "magic meter" which you can make use of to temporarily increase the powers of your ball, or you can use powerups bought in "stores". All of this is good. The only major problem is that if you wish to exit the game mid-world, it will save your level progress but you will lose your score. It almost feel like a bug marked as a feature.\n\nSome of the levels, however can be a bit boring as you try desperately to get that last block, as is often the case in breakout games. And definitely don't play on anything but the hardest setting as otherwise the ball will be too slow and the game will become boring. On a faster difficulty, things are much more of a challenge.\n\nThe game is best controlled with a mouse, but if you are playing on a tablet, or streaming to a tablet, that will also be a good way of controlling. I wuld not reccomend using a controller, but that is well supported if you want to.\n\nThe graphics are very reminiscent of a top-down jrpg, in a pixelated style. It's all very consitent and well drawn out. Similarly, the music has a very retro 8-bit feel. The music and art styles vary across all of the worlds giving you a good variety.\n\nAside from data not being fully saved if you quit the game mid-world I found no bugs in the game. It is very well polished. [Although if you want to change volume levels it's not a slider, it's a click-to-change-by-1% deal, so that may take some time]\n\nIf you like breakout retro-style games then this is definitely worth a buy. (And, If possible, avoid buying this game with a discount. The price is a good one).\n\n[edit 1:]\nNotice to achievement hunters only: If you are trying to replay the game for sake of getting 100%, there is little to be gained by this. Upon replaying you will find it may be useful to have something like netflix running videos as having played it once, you will already know all of the trick and it may become very repetitive.","August 31, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/recommended/207420/","loveandpeace","sigh of dog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/","809 products in account","Immediately upon seeing this game on the store page, I knew I had to have it; the presentation is absolutely top-tier NES-style, on par with the likes of Shovel Knight, and though I wished for a Zelda-esque adventure game only with a wizard star rather than a sword-swinger, Breakout clones are few and far between today and I definitely don't hate them.  So when it was on sale I grabbed it without hesitation.\n\nThat was a bit of a mistake.  It was a measly $1-2 (I don't recall, but around there), and I do feel the developers deserve such a paltry sum for the superb graphic and art style alone.  But as for the game itself...?\n\nQuite succinctly, it fails in one major aspect; the concept, though great in and of itself, utterly fails to deliver.  The idea is that it's a paddle-bouncing, block-busting game a la Breakout, Arkanoid etc. but with the twist that your player character controlling the paddle is actually a wizard, and can help his orb along by casting spells of both offensive and defensive natures.  Sounds fun, IS fun.  The problem?  Well, aside from a paltry four spells (plus a situational fifth that can only be cast upon death), which, as nice and functional as they are, leave a bit to be desired (and they only fall into the elements of Fire and Wind, where's Earth and Water?)... the magic meter is simply too meager and too difficult to refill.  Casting either of the smaller spells which, though useful, often need to be used multiple times for much effect, cost 1/10th of the entire bar.. and the really fun, powerful spells?  Nearly half the whole thing.  This wouldn't have been an issue at all except for the rarity with which you're able to recover magic at all.  There are really only three ways -- being lucky enough to get a magic potion to drop from a destroyed block which only restores a small amount of the magic meter and are very rare after the first couple stages of the first world, purchasing a fully-restoring potion at a shop (of which you'll be lucky to find two in an entire world and of course need to actually work your way into and then spend your hard-earned gold for it), and bouncing your orb against the paddle a grand total of TEN TIMES without it hitting any enemy or block for a tiny 10% 'pity' refill.  So more or less you're going to feel EXTREMELY strapped for magic and be very wary of spending ANY of it, EVER until you finally reach a point at which it's really needed, only to screw up and mis-aim an expensive strong spell then lose a life in your rage.\n\nIn addition, the worlds are very frankly too long.  With how time-consuming it tends to be to complete each individual stage, and the drollery of not even having powerups to look forward to since most are attached to your insanely stingy magic meter or bought for hefty coin from one of the rare shops (and then lost on death after that), you'll be more than ready to take a break after five stages.  But does it end after five?  No.  TEN?  Still no.  You're looking at a monsterious TWELVE long, boring stages AND a boss fight before you can even think about taking a break and shutting the game down.  I will at least admit that the bosses are pretty darn cool and I like seeing them in a game like this.\n\nBottom line: Gorgeous presentation is marred by woefully boring gameplay (that COULD VERY EASILY have been superior with changes as fall as a steadily-refilling magic meter to bring on the fun and a few less levels per world so you don't get hand cramps and/or overcome by drowsiness) and surprisingly lackluster music that again could have easily been knock-your-socks-off 8bit faire that could have alone, along with the graphics, picked the game up a bit, were they able to hire anyone even remotely as gifted at composing catchy 8bit tunes as Jake Kaufman or, say, any of the hundred or so comparably skilled composers who spend their days uploading free music to YouTube and probably would have done it for pennies on the dollar.  Alas.\n\nIf you want a great Breakout clone for PC, check out the superb DX Ball series, not this.","July 18, 2014","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well-made retro graphics with RPG elements thrown in for flavour lend a charming tone to the adventure.\n\nGameplay-wise though, it is thoroughly uninspired. Breakout was a simplistic game, spartan in its design -- which is why its many clones over the years have tried to spice up the basic formula. None of this here; you only have a few basic options at your disposal and the levels feel small and boring.\n\nEven worse, the game is split in chunks containing 12 of those levels, so don't expect to launch Wizorb for a quick brick breaker interlude. For some ill thought-out reason, this game expects more than a few minutes of your time each time. Unfortunately, this makes it even easier to get tired of the slow-paced, tedious level design.\n\nPlaying the game full-screen with a mouse, the controls also feel somewhat imprecise.\nIt plays better on a gamepad. In fact, the whole game makes more sense if you view it as something built to be experienced with a gamepad. It doesn't excuse Wizorb's problems, but certainly explains why they exist.\n\nHard to recommend, even at a low price. Good presentation goes a long way, but you cannot coast by entirely on charm.\n(I should mention I stopped playing midway through world 4.

Gold collection isn’t balanced well and you’ll just be too rich before you know it, unless you want to grind enough to purchase the joke ending.\n\nThere’s no world map except for a tiny town with maybe two points of interest.\n\nHigh-score mechanics weren’t well thought-out either: the worlds all have a maximum score you can attain by a flawless playthrough where you catch all falling objects, never die, and clear all bonus rooms. That is, except for the worlds with a fairy that drops a random number of gems in one of the levels, meaning that you need to repeat your flawless run of the whole world over and over until the fairy drops enough gems to get you higher on the scoreboard.\n\nThe magic system was especially disappointing: there’s really not enough mana to abuse your magical powers at any point, so you might as well be playing without it.\n\nAlso, you need to finish all levels in a world at once, or you have to start from the beginning. Better learn to hold onto those powerups, or you’ll just be losing them constantly. It can get frustrating.\n\nThe graphics are very well-animated pixel art, I’ll give it that. And it does kind of get fun if you can collect the cool powerups and learn to play without dying all the time. But the music is awful, the RPG mechanics might as well not be there, and playing through entire worlds at a time just gets tedious. You might like it, but I wouldn’t pay more than $1.50 for it if I were you. For an awesome brick-breaker, go play Shatter instead!\n","February 26, 2014","false","18.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

While the magic system might have been able to help alleviate this a bit, your overall magic carries over between levels, leaving you wondering if you want to use a fireball on that last block now or save it for the next, even "harder" level. Magic can be refilled, but only if you find a potion or the ball doesn't hit anything for eight bounces; potions are much too difficult to come by, and by the time the latter happens you'll have probably already saved & quit. And don't ask me how townspeople in a 2D game managed to be so one-dimensional, but like the spell system they do nothing to dull the pain of so much repetitive gameplay.\n\nOverall there's just too little spellcasting and too much ball-bouncing for this game to be worth anything to anyone but the most diehard of Breakout/Arkenoid enthusiasts. If you're really desperate for block-breaking with a twist, try Shatter, which is everything this game could have been sans retro coating.","March 11, 2014","false","4.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Unfortunately, this game doesn't do anything to change. That really is unfortunate in this case because this game does retro so well. It's got music that reminds me of Legend of Zelda, and I could see myself playing this on one of the old consoles, with the game's title art prominently displayed on its cartridge. The controls serve their purpose, although that may be where the problems start to come in. Aside from the paddle, you only control spell casting/ball launching. It's all pretty standard faire here really, which when it comes to Arkanoid clones, means it comes up as short as the genre.\n\nTo give some examples of fine genre features that don't benefit the fun factor: why can the ball travel faster from left to right than my paddle under any conditions? It means I often get to watch the ball go kerplunk, and consequently I'm constantly left wishing my paddle was just slightly faster. I can literally watch seconds tick off the clock as I know I'm about to lose a ball and there's nothing I can do about it. Why not have a little stamina bar that I can burn down to move faster for a short time, and then wait for it to refill (manually or automatically)? Why in 2012 (the game's release date) do I still have to choose between getting a powerup and not dieing? This is perhaps one of the worst feelings: constantly watching your powerups drop off the screen because the only way to get them is to touch them with the paddle. Why not have them sit there and require me to hit them with the ball? Or why not pick them up automatically once I've destroyed whatever block contained them and they are revealed? Or why not have a little automated helper that picks them up? Players experience less of what the game has to offer in the ways of powerups and spell-casting (since one of the powerups restores magic) because of this mechanic.\n\nI imagine the die-hard Arkanoid-clone fans would thoroughly enjoy this game and may even explain the number of positive reviews. I however felt myself wishing for something that better addressed what I (and likely many others) have felt are the genre's shortcomings. Not a bad game, but perhaps a little too much of the same ol' same ol' if you're not a big fan of this genre already. 5/10.","February 13","false","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

[KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]\n\nThe game had a good number of qualities to not disappoint me, but sadly it did. At first I tought it was a RPG hybrid, because you start the game walking around in a destroyed town and talking to people, but do not let this fool you: it is just a regular block breaker game. You complete levels by breaking all blocks on it and after beating a dozen levels in a row you also face a boss; in the meantime you try to collect gold that can be used on limited powerups or can be given to people to rebuild their houses (for the good ending).\n\nHow is it as block breaker? Just sub average. As you can see the graphic is "old style", I usually don't care for the style, but in this case I wasn't impressed at all: colors are too vivid and it is not so refined. It is not just "8-bit like", but it really seems to be 8-bit.\nYour character can be controlled by keyboard, but it too slow; the mouse will be your best choice, even if far from perfect: you will often find quite hard to fine tune the character's movements.\nLevel design is quite "meh", obstacles seem to be placed randomly and this will force you to bounce the ball more than it should be necessary in a so little space, quickly raising its speed to near light speed levels. Add to this the fact that you can only save in town.\nNot so bad, just not fun at all.\n\nBest played with Mouse\nRecommended Buy Price < 3$\nScore 5/10","February 24, 2014","false","7.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The magic mechanic is fun, but inconsistent - wind gust works in random directions . It is clear that the game designers have neglected testing the game, cause if i found so many mistakes, how many would beta testing would help to get rid off ? Several times i had to restart final level because levels did not finish after destroying everything besides indestructible objects - mainly the first level, though. The color changing blocks which you have to make all the same colour would be way less frustrating if there were less colors or if it was ... removed from the game. The game is pretty repetetive, however, graphics and music are nice, but not nice enough to hide gameplay flaws. The story is close to nonexistent - the starting city does not need to be rebuilt. The User Interface is broken - it shows up only sometimes when going into the shop - not really helpful if you want to get specific ammount of lives or just do not know whether you have money or not. There were many little flaws - like cows blocking you in their premises or walking triggering conversations all the time. I was disappointed to say the least - I expected some more magic times then 2, some more original powerups or anything that would make this game tip more to enjoyable rather than grindy...","March 1, 2014","false","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I found the art style detracted from the gameplay, lending it a sense of imprecision that isn't justified by the fairly solid mechanics underpinning it. The few callbacks to 16-bit game RPGs were more tedious than nostalgic and they tended to stifle my sense of progression by gating the more interesting bat & ball powers for too long. Steer clear of this one and check out Reaxxion instead, a far superior take on Breakout that's also available on Steam.","March 18, 2014","false","5.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Graphics are NES-like but they do the job. Instead of just breaking bricks, there are also enemies on screen you must hit and clear to advance to the next stage. The 'world' map is really counter-intuitive though - each mark is like a world of stages rather than one stage, so you have to get through a chunk of stages just to save your spot.\n\nLike others mention the RPG element is minimal and they could have done more with that. So with that in mind, this game is pretty much nothing but breakout. If you like those games you will like this one. Otherwise, it will get tedious like any breakout game.\n\nI finished the game but I don't remember much of it other than the above.

This blockbuster (pun intended) was known as Arkanoid. Now in the year 2012 we have a game that takes a similar approach to the genre gameplay wise, but throws everything else out the window and reinvents itself as something amazing.\n\nWizorb is an epic fantasy adventure seemingly haling from the golden years of gaming, however with a major twist. Rather than charge you with the task of smiting your foes through the normal means of combat, say through turn based or action gameplay, Wizorb first checks if you have the balls to take on the challenge. Cyrus, the wizardly main character, transforms himself into a mystical orb and proceeds to use his staff as a paddle to knock him into his foes. Aside from your enemies, you can also break bricks, chests, barrels, and other items strewn through the playfield, with plenty of powerups to collect as a reward.\n\nThere are also various spells at your disposal which you should master if you wish to win the day. You can for instance launch fireballs, or use a gust of wind to change the direction of your orb. If you use your magic sparingly and at the right time, you can drastically alter the flow of the game. Wizorb definitely takes a fair bit more thinking to overcome it's challenges than the games that inspired it.\n\nWith all these interesting additions to the genre, and wonderful pixel art by Paul Robertson, Wizorb is truely a wonderful experience which can be enjoyed by veterans and newcomers to the genre alike. A $2.99 asking price also sweetens the deal, considering you get 5 worlds, 60 levels, plenty of items to buy with your gold, and EPIC boss fights. Wizorb is is a must buy for anyone who ever enjoyed breaking blocks with their balls.","November 25, 2013","true","0.3"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Not hate, not anger, but a persistent frustration and unpleasantness.  The game is not pretty and the graphics options don’t help it at all, but that’s forgivable.  The game play however is boring, and actually agony inducing at times.  The hub world basically does nothing.  A destroyed town with everyone begging for gold to rebuild which you can get small bonuses like keys for giving.  Sadly that’s all you get as I must have rebuild half the town and it offered no bonus beyond the initial offering.  I had played this game and abandoned it in disappointment some time ago, only to pick it up again for the steam cards.  With the poor copy or Arcanoid gameplay it felt very much like I was doing homework.  Your progress isn’t saved when you lose, you have a limited number of continues and the story will not advance AT ALL unless you defeat the boss in each world, which for the first one was 15 levels in.  After repeated attempts and shuffling the game down to easy I finally beat the first world only to find all that effort meant nothing.  And to add insult to injury, out 3/5 possible cards for draw the system gave me 3 copies of the same damn card.","March 22, 2014","false","1.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fz3n/recommended/207420/","fz3n","fz3n","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fz3n/","261 products in account","It's a pixelated breakout game with RPG elements, a story, hidden levels, powerups, and a unique system that allows you to use collected magic power to cast spells. The ball increases in speed with each bounce until it is lost, keeping the game difficult and encouraging you to creatively use spells to finish each level as quickly as possible.\n\nThe biggest problem this game has is the length of time you have to play to make progress. Each level is composed of 12 stages with a boss fight at the end. There is no saving or returning to a level without starting over. This results in play sessions of more than 40 minutes before saving any progress, which is unusual as most would describe breakout as a casual genre.\n\nAdditionally, the life system is a little archaic. If you lose all of your lives in a level, you must start at the first of the thirteen stages again. However, the game carries over extra lives that have been earned in previous levels, negating any difficulty for players who have managed to save up lives when they are abundant in early stages, and making the game unusually hard to progress through for a player new to the genre.\n\nIt's a fun game to chill out with if breakout is your thing, but it's not worth trying if you aren't already down with the whole ball-and-paddle thing.","July 24, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You often don't have enough magic meter to do what you need, leaving you to pointlessly bounce around the orb for what can literally be minutes before hitting anything. -1\n\n- The music seems like it's decent at best, but there are very few songs overall, none of which stand out as something awesome or notable.  -1\n\n- Story truly isn't very compelling or even a reason at all to want to play the game. -1\n\n- Cheap game; especially when on sale, which somewhat bumps off some of the negativity.\n\n- For what it's worth, at least the sale price(s), it really isn't a huge ripoff, even if the game has more bad then good. +1\n\n- Short game. Lasted roughly 5~ hours for me to beat it, though I might go back sometimes just to test out random things. +/- 1\n\nOverall I'd say I bought the game because it was cheap, a good, somewhat fun way to pass the time, and it looks very nice. Probably not a totally bad game to play, or even gift perhaps, as long as you buy it for cheap, otherwise it might not be worth the few dollars.","June 24, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These mechanics will be used by you when the level is just boring andyou want to hurry things along. And that kinda sucks. The last boss needs to be killed with this magic, and it runs out so yeah. I have played games like this before, but the brick breaking never seemed so lame. I would suggest you try Shatter instead.\nNote - If you are visually impared, this game should not be too difficult to play.

Except for the towns and shops there are no RPG elements, you can't level up and the story is not important. But to me that's a plus. The only downsides to the game are the uninspired music and the small number of levels. You can easily play through the game in one session.

Magic is also very weak for the most part. Game expects you to go through more than 12 levels before it allows you to retrieve any resources for improving town/character; these imrovements seem necessary for later play. Thus, you may find yourself worn down in the earliest levels before you can retrieve a cent; this leaves you with nothing but frustration, as the magic is not really there (you cannot afford to cast a specll every level, and you can break a (singular) 1 hit block per cast; you can get the super break for 1s for more than half your mana, your can get precision control for over half your mana. And you can push the ball rightwards. For brick breaker (aka punchthrough aka fireball) and precision control you have to cast the instant the ball hits the paddle. It also starts you as small paddle (or so it appears).\n\nUltimately, getting far enough in the game -to play the game- is an an noying slog; I do not reccomend this game.","June 23, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The well known Breakout but with pretty sprite art and some extra gimmicks. If you get stuck bouncing the ball everywhere the game will spare you and give you free mana which is welcome, and some stages contain rooms to improve youself.\n\nHowever that's pretty much what Wizorb offers to stay unique, and still is able to keep the flaws of Breakout. Like the original game it will require lots and lots of patience and prediction, as even if the game gives you some free mana to destroy the last block or enemy in some areas that won't be reliable to finish it. This will lead to losing lifes or spending lots of time to clear a single stage. This includes that in each area you have to beat 13 stages in a row with 3 continues, as otherwise you'll have to start all over if you wanna go to the next area.\n\nIf you can handle the waiting game to destroy blocks Wizorb is as good as Breakout. But if you lose the nerve like myself because the ball keeps hitting walls too close of the dead zone or because is taking ages to destroy THAT LAST BLOCK you'll become easily frustrated.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fz3n/recommended/207420/","fz3n","fz3n","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fz3n/","261 products in account","It's a pixelated breakout game with RPG elements, a story, hidden levels, powerups, and a unique system that allows you to use collected magic power to cast spells. The ball increases in speed with each bounce until it is lost, keeping the game difficult and encouraging you to creatively use spells to finish each level as quickly as possible.\n\nThe biggest problem this game has is the length of time you have to play to make progress. Each level is composed of 12 stages with a boss fight at the end. There is no saving or returning to a level without starting over. This results in play sessions of more than 40 minutes before saving any progress, which is unusual as most would describe breakout as a casual genre.\n\nAdditionally, the life system is a little archaic. If you lose all of your lives in a level, you must start at the first of the thirteen stages again. However, the game carries over extra lives that have been earned in previous levels, negating any difficulty for players who have managed to save up lives when they are abundant in early stages, and making the game unusually hard to progress through for a player new to the genre.\n\nIt's a fun game to chill out with if breakout is your thing, but it's not worth trying if you aren't already down with the whole ball-and-paddle thing.","July 24, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In addition you can buy multi-ball power-ups, sticky paddle and larger paddle from shops to name a few.\n\nAll in all there are other breakout games but none of them quite hit this niche of  dual nostalgia.

While playing entirely like a breakout game, the overall feel of the game leaves the impression of it containing RPG elements, which is entirely welcome. It's very short, but it's also only $3. My only complaint would be that the player does not aquire new spells throughout the game, as it would have been very fun to learn and use new spells aside from the ones you begin the game with. Despite this, I played the game through to completion on normal difficulty, and I know I will come back to conquer hard mode.

It has a really charming retro style both with art and sound. Although the asthetic is pleasing however, the game is a little boring. The best part about the game are the boss fights, however the levels prior are so meh. The twist here is that you have magical powers, you can shoot fireballs, or control the ball. These mechanics will be used by you when the level is just boring andyou want to hurry things along. And that kinda sucks. The last boss needs to be killed with this magic, and it runs out so yeah. I have played games like this before, but the brick breaking never seemed so lame. I would suggest you try Shatter instead.\nNote - If you are visually impared, this game should not be too difficult to play. The final two worlds may pose some issues with contrast, but its not too bad.

In addition you can buy multi-ball power-ups, sticky paddle and larger paddle from shops to name a few.\n\nAll in all there are other breakout games but none of them quite hit this niche of  dual nostalgia.

The game looks like a combination of RPG and the classic Breakout/Arkanoid games, but there are actually very few RPG elements here. Mostly the magic spells the player can use. NPCs have very little influence in the game and rebuilding the town only provides extra lives, extra keys and two advantages (building ramparts on levels and opening a shop)\n- Not many uses for money. You use it to rebuild the town and buy items and there are few items to buy - mostly powerups. After you have everything (which is pretty easy to do), the only use for money is buying extra lives and magic refills.\n- Progress only saves when you finish a world. Worlds aren't too long but if you lose all your lives and go back to the map, you don't keep anything you obtained.\n- Losing a life means you lose all your powerups. This wouldn't be too much of an issue if they were easier to re-obtain, but they aren't. Some powerups can only be obtained on certain worlds and because as mentioned above progress only saves when you finish a world, you have to replay entire worlds to re-obtain those powerups.\n- In addition to the two items above, if you lose a life and your powerups and go back to the map before finishing the world, you don't keep what you obtained - but you still lose your powerups from the life you lost.\n- Hitboxes for the ball and objects can be a little weird. Sometimes it looks like the ball is going to hit an object but instead it hits something else nearby.\n\nThis game would be a LOT better if there were more RPG games in this game and more uses for money. A leveling system with stats affecting things like ball speed and wand movement speed, buying and selling items with each of them having different effects on gameplay, etc.\n\nStill, for the price this game costs, it's definitely recommended.","March 21, 2015","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a really charming retro style both with art and sound. Although the asthetic is pleasing however, the game is a little boring. The best part about the game are the boss fights, however the levels prior are so meh. The twist here is that you have magical powers, you can shoot fireballs, or control the ball. These mechanics will be used by you when the level is just boring andyou want to hurry things along. And that kinda sucks. The last boss needs to be killed with this magic, and it runs out so yeah. I have played games like this before, but the brick breaking never seemed so lame. I would suggest you try Shatter instead.\nNote - If you are visually impared, this game should not be too difficult to play. The final two worlds may pose some issues with contrast, but its not too bad. Also due to the art style, most text is a little blocky so you might have to struggle a little to figure out what letter is what, but the text is not that important.","March 14, 2015","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The things that set it apart from standard Breakout are enemies and the magic system, neither of which work well in practice.

The breakout/RPG mashup is potentially very fun but not enough was done with shops, bonus power-ups, and special abilities to make the game truly shine. Shatter is a modern example of power-ups done better but you can go all the way back to Arkanoid and that game still does a better job with power-ups/-downs in 1986 than Wizorb in 2011. There could have optional side-quests, rewards for helping the townsfolk, a lot more buffs/de-buffs to be used on the fly but instead this game ends up being a basic breakout experience with a little flair and a thin coat of RPG paint.\n\nIf those were the only issues, I could recommend this with some minor hesitations but what pushes this title into the "Not Recommended" category is the way the quit and save features work. This game would lend itself very well to a quick play session now and again but instead forces the player to play through an entire world (12 levels and a boss) if you want to keep the gold you've accumulated. That alone is terrible and is, unfortunately, why I can't recommend this title.","July 30, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game looks like a combination of RPG and the classic Breakout/Arkanoid games, but there are actually very few RPG elements here. Mostly the magic spells the player can use. NPCs have very little influence in the game and rebuilding the town only provides extra lives, extra keys and two advantages (building ramparts on levels and opening a shop)\n- Not many uses for money. You use it to rebuild the town and buy items and there are few items to buy - mostly powerups. After you have everything (which is pretty easy to do), the only use for money is buying extra lives and magic refills.\n- Progress only saves when you finish a world. Worlds aren't too long but if you lose all your lives and go back to the map, you don't keep anything you obtained.\n- Losing a life means you lose all your powerups. This wouldn't be too much of an issue if they were easier to re-obtain, but they aren't. Some powerups can only be obtained on certain worlds and because as mentioned above progress only saves when you finish a world, you have to replay entire worlds to re-obtain those powerups.\n- In addition to the two items above, if you lose a life and your powerups and go back to the map before finishing the world, you don't keep what you obtained - but you still lose your powerups from the life you lost.\n- Hitboxes for the ball and objects can be a little weird. Sometimes it looks like the ball is going to hit an object but instead it hits something else nearby.\n\nThis game would be a LOT better if there were more RPG games in this game and more uses for money. A leveling system with stats affecting things like ball speed and wand movement speed, buying and selling items with each of them having different effects on gameplay, etc.\n\nStill, for the price this game costs, it's definitely recommended.","March 21, 2015","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The breakout/RPG mashup is potentially very fun but not enough was done with shops, bonus power-ups, and special abilities to make the game truly shine. Shatter is a modern example of power-ups done better but you can go all the way back to Arkanoid and that game still does a better job with power-ups/-downs in 1986 than Wizorb in 2011. There could have optional side-quests, rewards for helping the townsfolk, a lot more buffs/de-buffs to be used on the fly but instead this game ends up being a basic breakout experience with a little flair and a thin coat of RPG paint.\n\nIf those were the only issues, I could recommend this with some minor hesitations but what pushes this title into the "Not Recommended" category is the way the quit and save features work. This game would lend itself very well to a quick play session now and again but instead forces the player to play through an entire world (12 levels and a boss) if you want to keep the gold you've accumulated. That alone is terrible and is, unfortunately, why I can't recommend this title.","July 30, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bumblebug/recommended/207420/","bumblebug","Bumblebugbee3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bumblebug/","250 products in account","Wizorb at its core is a block breaking game similar to Breakout and Arkanoid.  The difference from these classics is how it expands on their simple formula in almost every way possible.  You play as the wizard Cyrus who transforms himself into his staff to be used as your paddle.  Like any true wizard you have magical powers that will help aid you on your journey.  If its adventure you find yourself on you can bet there is a story too.  This game tries to do a lot of things and usually manages to do so quite successfully.\n\nWizorb is a very vibrate and colorful game with its 16-bit inspired, retro, graphics.  The different monsters, environments, pick-ups, and bricks all come together for a clean, uniform, style.  While the story isn't quite a enthralling as the visuals it does help incentivize your progression.  Tarot village has been ravaged my monsters and all the town folk need money to repair their homes and businesses.  By playing through the different levels you'll even money you can use both to help out the citizens and buy different power-ups.  The power-ups will give you a temporary boost that last until you lose a life.  The different power-ups from range from paddle extensions to sticky, slow and multi balls.\n\nThe long the ball remains in play it will move faster with each hit off your paddle.  At top speed its become quite difficult to keep your paddle lined up with the ball.  Thankfully, you have different magic powers you can to help make life easier.  As soon as the ball bounces off your paddle you can transform it into a burning ball that will pass through multiple bricks or give it wings and guide it into a certain area.  While the ball is flying around you can shoot fireballs from your paddle or blow a gust of wind to change the direction of your ball.  These all drain your magic bar which can be replenished with potions.  Also, if you go so long without hitting anything your ball will start to glow and the next time you hit it you'll receive some magic.\n\nThere are five different areas you must fight through to save the kingdom.  Each area has a unique theme, a set number of stages, and a boss battle.  Each level becomes progressively harder with bricks and enemies becoming tougher and harder to hit.  Look for rooms that provide bonuses and shops.  Watch out as any purple objects that falls onto your paddle with have a negative effect and could even kill you.  Replay levels for coins, score, and bonus stages used to free four sages who when reunited grant access to a special power.\n\nWizorb is a beautiful indie game with some really unique mechanics.  The sense of progression of the difficulty feels spot on.  Only in the last area does the game really start to almost too difficult.  There are times too where it feels the paddle isn't quite as responsive as it needs to be which can be frustrating when the ball gets up to top speed.  These aspects do make this game feel a little bit harder than it needed to be however Wizorb is still easy to recommend.  The magic abilities are a blast and there is a wonderful sense of adventure.  This is arcade style game is wonderfully crafted and thoroughly enjoyable.","February 28","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll have a much better time.\n\nOh, and as a Breakout clone, it's kind of meh. It's alright, but it could be way better, and having to do levels in sets of 12 is really annoying. Still, I didn't ever find myself really disliking it too much. If you got it during a bundle, then give it a try, but definitely don't buy at full price.","January 24","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to earn gold to rebuild the town but the only way to earn any gold is to play through every single level in a stage, and just to be clear, the first stage has something like 12 levels, and you start with 3 lives that if you lose them all you're forced to start over with no gain.

The single most essential thing for a twitch /skill based game was the controls are tight.  I use my xbox controller and everything just worked the way it should.  (No idea what keyboard gameplay is like.)\n\nSome later levels become somewhat frustrating due to an over reliance on unbreakable and hard to reach bricks.\n\nYou get some handy spells to help compensate for these setbacks, however the Mana resource was always hard to acquire, meaning a lot of the time I was out of mana and praying  I could finally hit the last brick before the speed became too fast and I died.\n\nThat is one thing to note - there is a lot of times in endgame when you are waiting down the bottom like a chump while the ball bounces in loops between unbreakable surfaces.  There is even an achievement that celebrates it- "Infinite Loop - The orb bounces for 45 seconds before coming back to the magic wand."\n\nThe ball also has a nasty habit of being very hard to predict as it speeds up.  So after watching it bounce 30 times and suddenly shooting out at a random angle causing you to miss / lose a life, swearing becomes quite common.\n\nI found myself in general having to "stockpile" lives for later missions by repeating easier levels.\n\nHowever I had more fun than I had frustration.  I liked it enough to spend the last 10 hours playing it to completion, and there is still plenty gameplay left; masochistic achievements to obtain, personal scores to beat, and in general just enjoying a fun arcade game.\n\nGameplay:   7/10\n\nResponsive. Addictive. Mostly more fun than frustrating.  Mostly.\n\nSound: 7/10\n\nAll the right beeps and boops, nothing that stands out.\n\nReplayability:     9\n\nThis is the kind of game you keep coming back to, because at it heart its\na Breakout arcade game, which was always about trying to achieve a high score.\n\nOverall Score: 8\n\nI had a blast with this game, it did everything it promised and then a little more.\n\n... damn those unbreakable bricks and long loops though.  ugh.","January 9","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
