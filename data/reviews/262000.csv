It was full of adult humor and powered by a dark mystery surrounding voodoo. HD Remakes are now the nature of the game, and Gabriel Knight is next to get its upgrade. It does away with the 2D visuals of the first game and takes its steps into a fully realized 3D world.\n\nFor those who don’t know about the story of Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, it follows a charismatic novelist who gets involved in a murder case. He’s been having terrible dreams that depict him dying a specific death, and soon he’ll discover that they lead to even more problems. Gabriel will travel across the city investigating the "Voodoo Murders" for his book. He will find love and intrigue as he tries to discover the secret behind the murders in New Orleans.\n\nThe Anniversary Edition makes some major changes from the original. The visual bump from 2D to 3D is the obvious change, with many of the key areas and characters re-imagined for higher resolutions. Even the comic book scenes have been changed to include better art and speech baloons. It definitely looks much better than the classic version, but it loses all of the nostalgia factor for those that have already played it. Despite a few odd animations when moving around the title is a beautiful recreation of the classic.\n\nInteracting with objects and moving around the city is easier than ever. Simply double tapping an area will teleport Gabriel to a certain point in the room. A new icon now allows players to quickly leave an area and head to the world map at any time. No more waiting through long animations to wait for in a game with tons of backtracking.\n\nThat's a staple of classic adventure games but this HD remake makes some changes to how the story unravels. Certain aspects of the story and puzzles are shifted around among the various days. For example, in the original game Gabriel would visit his grandmother on the first day. In the new version he doesn't visit her until the week is nearly over. It's subtle little changes like this that adds a welcome freshness to a familiar story.\n\nFans of the classic will notice that the voices have changed for many of their favorite characters. Anyone that has played the original would be familiar with the popping and static in the original game. Sadly, Tim Curry, Mark Hamil, and many others were not able to re-record their voices. Instead, they have been replaced by a whole new cast who try to replicate the voices as much as they can. They do a fairly great job at sounding like the original characters, and some voices actually sound better than the original. The only change I miss is Leah Remini's fiesty run as Grace Nakamura.\n\nThe upgraded animations are the best improvements to the title. You can actually tell what everyone is actually doing on-screen. It comes at a small sacrifice however, as there are zones where the world feels less alive because of ambience removal. The crime scene was hectic when Gabriel reaches the location in the first game, but it seems much calmer in the upgraded version. Also, the police station doesn’t have that lively hustle and bustle about it anymore.\n\nIt’s good that the upgraded puzzle design outweighs a few removed animations. No more randomly clicking on pixels to find a snake scale in the sand. U.I. upgrades and of course cleaner graphics improve the experience from the original. The puzzles in Gabriel Knight have always been well thought-out (besides that awful clock puzzle.) Now Gabriel has a journal to keep up with current events for the day, and if all else fails a new hint system is in place to help players push through the story.\n\nMy only real complaints come from the puzzles that allow players to clear manual input. Some of them have incredibly long strings, but the player will only be able to clear all the text instead of deleting a single character. Another problem I have is the strange speech baloons during the comic book cutscenes. Maybe it is the extensions that block the visuals on screen, but I just think it looks out of place and unnecessary.\n\nDo any of these changes make the Anniversary Edition better than the original? That’s going to be subjective to anyone that’s played the first game. There are always going to be games that we mesh more with and don’t want touched (Chrono Trigger, I’m looking at you) but for people who don’t mind seeing games upgraded, you can’t go wrong with this remake. It's a fantastic recreation of a classic title, and it even features some behind the scenes content from the original game for the nostalgic. Geek Citadel gives Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition 4 stars out of 5. A lot has changed to bring this classic to the HD world, but it's still very much a classic.","October 15, 2014","true","9.4"," 79 of 92 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","79","92","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/262000/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","Gabriel Knight is one of those classic adventure games that has it all. At its core, a rich, engaging story involving voodoo, occult & sacrifice in New Orleans. Uncovering old family secrets & discovering your destiny. A cast of interesting, reoccuring characters full of personality. Mystery, murder, horror, star-crossed lovers & challenging puzzles. And off course, that black trenchcoat & that awkward southern accent! It's all been faithfully reproduced.\n\nThe 20th Anniversary edition, could be likened to a "Director's Cut". The full story is still there, nothing missed, but some things are remixed appearing at different days or points in the story. There is also a few new things added. This all up, adds some freshness for those familiar with the original '93 release. It plays well and the changes made seem logical, balancing out the gameplay & story arcs.\n\nCutscenes deserve a special commendation. They're done in a comic style (frame-by-frame), beautifully done, almost popping out the screen at times. These added a lot of emotional impact to the story.\n\nAlthough Gabriel Knight is a fairly logical (by point-n-click adventure game standards), its still an old school design, so there is some strange logic at times, ultimately adding to the difficulty & forcing you to think creatively. There are clues throughout the dialog though (& your Journal), so its important to always pay attention, even if it seems to be irrelevant at the time. It's a deep, detailed story to explore. Finding the clues, and figuring it all out is well-paced & generally an enjoyable experience. Makes you want to explore everything just to make sure you don't miss anything!\n\nThere is great (fully voiced) dialog along with some funny adult humor & sexual tension between Gabe & Grace/Malia to spice up some of the conversations too. Although the voice acting is top notch, Gabriel's voice did grind at me (along with Gabriel's unlikable persona) for the first 2-3 days (in-game episodes). I got used to the voice eventually, and persona-wise this does change over the course of the 10 day episodes the game is split into. I though the creole narrator was particulary good, although if you don't like it you can turn her off.\n\nWhen you add the combination of the excellent remastered soundtrack (changes per location), along with the gorgeous highly detailed painted artwork, to the top voice acting, it creates an immersive experience with a unique ambience to every scene. I found myself just sitting back sometimes, taking it all in before progressing in the story.\n\nMost of the scripted animations were well done, although I found the animations for Gabriel a bit stiff at times when moving around a scene. It wasn't terrible, but it was noticable. You can also see clipping issues from time to time or the odd glitch.\n\nInterface was clear & functional and there is a limited hint system. It was nice to be able to double click to 'teleport' to a point. Click the exit to the scene just gently fades out was a smooth touch too. There is also a lot of content to sink you teeth into, for me it too around 25hrs to figure everything out to complete the 10 days & all achievements (although I am sure you can do it much faster!).\n\nFeels like a lot of care was taken to get this right. This is a quality, story-rich supernatural point-n-click adventure, honoring the spirit of the original. It reintroduces Gabriel Knight to a whole new generation of gamers, while bringing back fond memories for many older gamers.\n\nI really enjoyed the entire experience. Highly recommended!\n\n(PS - Hope this leads to the sequels getting the same 'Anniversary' treatment sometime in the future!)\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","October 26, 2014","true","32.2"," 52 of 57 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","52","57","0","7"

Gabriel might be too much of a playboy at first, but he got better towards the end. And the other characters are insteresting enough and offer voice acting that I can't complain about. I really didn't like the narrator, though. Her voice can be turned off, however.\n\nThe story is also interesting from beginning to end, although I found Gabriels relationship to Malia highly unrealistic.\nAnd for an adventure game, it offers a whole lot of puzzles, all of  which are logical enough to be solved without having to endlessly wreck your brain. I hated the pantomine, however. And deciphering some of the codes towards the end took me a while.\n\nBut if you're ever stuck, the game offers a hint-system with multiple levels. It doesn't offer solutions on a silver platter, but gets you far enough to proceed. Except for day 4, where I found myself wandering around aimlessly as I had no idea how to solve a specific puzzle until I decided to look at a certain book again.\n\nThese comfort-features do have a downside, though. Their implementation is lacking.\n\nShow all hotspots - plasters terms all over the screen instead of showing subtle hints\nSkip through dialogue - speeds up the game, which is very noticeable at times. Also can lead to skipping multiple lines of text\nRun to a specific spot - run? Gabriel doesn't run. He teleports!\nContinue - does not continue from your last save but from an autosave at the last map you visited\n\nIt does have a few good features, however. If you click on an exit, the screen fades out almost instantly. And you can get to the worldmap from almost any screen. Important dialogue is also marked. And the journal contains extra-features for every map, like interviews, artworks etc...\n\nI'm sure I could mention more, but I've already written a whole review in German :D\n\nIf you've never played Gabriel Knight, I don't see a reason not to buy this version. Is the original superior? Maybe, but I liked what I got.","October 15, 2014","true","13.3"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","42","50","0","0"

This is how fantastic GK (and the whole series, really) is.\n\nPeriodically I would look up old point-and-clicks I used to play, or search desperately through new releases in this genre, and with every point-and-click adventure I'd find and play to limited satisfaction, I'd mutter to myself, "why can't I find something like Gabriel Knight?"\n\nGabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is my favorite game. Like, I'm saying of *all time* here. I attribute this to Jane Jensen and her team's wonderful storywriting skills: You will not find a point-and-click game anywhere else with more story and lore than this one. It is literally *the* game to beat in terms of this genre.\n\nThis anniversary edition does wonderful justice to the original; revised just enough to keep up with a more modern market, while still keeping the same fantastic atmosphere of the original. I could not recommend a game more.\n\nThank you for re-releasing my favorite game, I am so overcome with excitement I've lost my eloquence! <3 JUST BUY IT ALREADY","October 24, 2015","true","13.5"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","1"

Was that really 20 years ago? Seems like yesterday when it came out. Back in the days when I was starting out playing PC and videogames. I had so many fond memories that I actually  shied away for long weeks before playing the revamped version on Steam , not wanting to spoil my memories of the game by a bad new version. But here's my two cents.\n\nGraphics  8 of 10\nThe graphics made a huge step forward from 1993, of course. I liked the improvement, from dust particles that can be seen when the sun shines through a window, to the sometime kind of 3D backgrounds and characters. Advertised it is as being HD, but well it's not all HD, the story is done e.g. told in comic style. Because truth be told, back in the 90ies the graphics were so ugly, that sometimes you were just clicking around with your mouse, just hoping you hit something that could be useful. Big Thumbs up for the improvement!\n\nGameplay/Story  8.5 of 10\nEven after all this time, the story still feels fresh .Gabriel Knight's humor and dialogues are still fun and feel fresh. The game is an Absolut classic. Voodoo Gods, the New Orleans Flair and the story of the Schattenjägers. The riddles are tricky and sometimes a little farfetched, but the producers added a new hint system in your diary, which should help beginners of the genre. And even though I been playing the game before, it still took me around 14 hours.\n\nMusic & Voice     8.5 of 10\nThe 90ies music was replaced by a new mix by the original composer. Very fitting. Nothing against old-school, but 90ies PC music was not that good. I was surprised how fitting the voice actors were. Especially the voice of Gabriel Knight.\n\nFinal Verdict\nDefinitely a must buy for nostalgic gamers (like me) , adventure gamers in general and probably the best game for starters of the genre.","May 12, 2015","true","13.4"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","37","43","0","0"

One of my favorite games of the 90s and definitely one of Sierra's best games.\n\nGabriel Knight is a novelist and owner of St. George's Rare Books in New Orleans. He's in the middle of writing a new book about the recent string of Voodoo related murders. The writer, Jane Jensen of Sierra fame, did a particularly good job of representing the city of New Orleans and it's vibrant history, and the story itself still holds up well after 20+ years.\n\nIt was a little disappointing that they couldn't get Tim Curry to reprise his role as the voice of Gabriel, but I'm sure he was a little too expensive for Pinkerton Road to even consider, let alone the likes of Mark Hamill and Michael Dorn. The actor they got to voice Gabriel in the remake did a commendable job and kept the original style of southern charmer and womanizer, and a few chuckles can be found by using the hand and eye icons on most of the female characters in the game.\n\nWhile the 3D rendering of the remake brings new life to the game(and it is beautiful), it's a little disappointing to an old school gamer like myself. See, back in the day, adventure games were much more complex and unforgiving. The high resolution textures take the challenge away of having to find a tiny object in the sea of 256 color pixelation of the original.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging and require that you pay attention to the information you're gathering from extensive conversations with the various characters in the game. You can't just fumble through this one. if you try, you'll likely be backktracking often or finding yourself using a walkthrough (anyone else remember old Sierra hint books?) to use a walkthrough in later parts of the game. Fortunately for me, I played through this game several times and actually remembered much of what was required to have the game move forward.\n\nIf you want to see where the great adventure games of today got their inspiration from, buy this game and support Jane Jensen's new operation. Then maybe one day the Sierra of old shall return. Nah...scratch that. Just stay small and independent and avoid those buyouts so you can continue to breath new life into the genre.\n\nNow Steam just needs to release Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within, but not a remake. It's perfect just the way it is.","March 2","true","19.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

Play the demo first, it's a good representation.\n\nIf you, after completing the demo find the game interesting and, want to continue your experience I would suggest that you back up your saves, before the purchase, because Steam will just delete it all upon installation of the full game.\n\nI was a bit sceptical about the game at first, especially in regards to the new boy'ish look of Gabriel Knight and this silly southern voice that is being used, but also in regard to the changes of design. It took me awhile to get past that change and I was just barely ahead of it at the end of the demo.\n\nTruth be told I was never really a fan of the GK series even though I tried my hand with all them in their own time with a declining interest, that was completely gone after five minutes with GK3. I generally despised the Sierra Adventure games, because they were so dull, traditionally old-school and unforgiving somehow compared to the humorous and creative Lucasarts Adventure games I loved.\n\nI am glad to see that Pinkerton Studios have gotten a much better hold on the game engine that severely scarred the previous Mobius game. Gone are the wandering eyes and jittery animations.. There is still a few minor flaws, but much less than before. There is also lip-syncing and it works surprisingly well.\n\nI read quite a lot of reviews about the game, the good, bad and ugly, because I was a bit lukewarm about GK, but I was curious and played the demo first and even though this new version isn't quite the same high-caliber version as the original it's not a bad game, not a bad game at all, but it's clearly not a total remastery of the old game, since they've changed the voice actors. Even though I was quite resentful of the voice of Gabriel Knight in the beginning it kind of grew on me and the accent is also more downplayed as the game goes on. The rest of the voice cast is pretty decent.\n\nMy only real complaint about the game is the background Music - it's bloody horrible and totally out of place with the spirit of the game unlike the game music during cutscenes which is very well done. I was about ready to quit before the demo even got started, because of it, but I hit a key to skip the intro credits and turn off the music, which saved the day.\n\nThere is a new hint system in the game, but unfortunately it's neither very intelligent nor progress based. The few times I needed it I was way ahead of the hint system and had to wait for the hints to catch up to my point of progress, because of build-in timer, that I assume has been put in place to avoid that you spoil yourself too much and even then it was extremely rare that it was useful at all. At one point it was completely useless and I had to Google for a solution, because I got a bit ahead of myself and was unable to pick up on a vital clue on how to unlock an important puzzle.\n\nThere were times when I was a bit lost about my next move, because the game is a bit short of a narrative and there is a certain amount of things that you need to solve before the day ends, which isn't very clear, but the first hint of each day usually give you a list of to-do's of the day. I do not recommend using the hint system at all, because the game is actually quite short.\n\nI saw a reviewer complaining about the same animations being played every time you leave an area, but that's kind of a silly point, because you can use fast-travel everywhere. You don't have to leave any area by going to an exit point at all, because you can bring up the map at any point, which is really nice, but unfortunately Gabriel Knights current location isn't highlighted on the map at all.. Sometimes I went to places where I was already.. The same teleportation system in Mobius has transferred to GK1 as well, but there are times when you need someone to follow you that it backfires.\n\nThere is still a bit of the old ghost of Sierra's unforgiving gameplay present, but the good news is that there has been added a RETRY option for those special events.\n\nI finished the game in 15 hours and I am actually a bit surprised that I had a such a good time with it. Jane Jensen was a much better writer twenty years ago, but she also had a co-writer on GK1, and that part still stands.\n\nSettings:\n\nGameplay:\nNarrator Off, Hints On, Subtitles: On, Tutorials: Off, Language: English.\n\nAudio:\nMaster: On, Music: Off, SFX: On, Voices: On.\n\nGraphics:\nDisplay: Beautiful - Resolution: 1920x1200 - Anti-aliasing: 4 - (+Morphological AA: On (AMD))","November 6, 2014","true","36.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

New Orleans\n\nThe game opens with Gabriel emerging into his book shop, the Saint Georges book store,  following a restless nights sleep.\nHe's being plagued by nightmares which might have something to do with the fact that he is investigating a spate of "Voodoo murders" for a new book.\nFrom here, you'll begin your journey around New Orleans and then further afield as you research the Murders and uncover secrets about your own mysterious past.\n\n\nPoint & Quip\n\nThis is a point and click adventure in its purest form.\n\nThere are a multitude of items you can click on at each location, all of which will invoke some sort of response, either from Gabriel himself or from "the narrator" (Who I'm convinced is the Voodoo Lady from the  Monkey Island games that I mentioned earlier.)\n\nJust looking around, exploring the environment can be entertaining in its own right. Click on a book in Gabriels shop for instance  and  "Mrs Monkey Island Voodoo Lady" will comment "The books have been chosen for their special  appeal.... in other words nothing written by Gabriel"\n\nWhether these quips make you roll your eyes or chuckle out loud they definitely make exploring each scene fun and interesting.\n\n\nCajun Twang\n\nSins of the Fathers is a "Full Talky" and I'm happy to report that the voice work is competently done with more suitably colourful accents than you could shake a deep fried chicken on a stick at.\n\nAll this would mean nothing without snappily written dialogue and the writing here is sharper than the spines of a Mississippi cat fish.\n\n\nIt's not Vanity if it's True\n\nSins of the fathers graphics have also had a major overhaul. They're crisp and colourful and I'm sure Gabriel himself would tell you he's never looked so good.\nThe animations are smoother than the Bourbon at Mardi Gras and interface is clean and intuitive.\n\n\nStuck in the Bayou\n\nOf course underpinning all the prettiness is the same classic game we all loved back in the 90's.\n\nAs such it's a fairly long game when compared to todays standards, you'll have clocked up around  15 hours of game play by the time the end credits roll, so getting your monies worth out of this title isn't in question.\n\nYou should also keep in mind that Sins of the Fathers  puzzles don't pull any punches, you are going to get stuck from time to time, this is an adventure from a period when "men were men, women were women and puzzles were hard".\nMoving the story forward is always more than enough reward for the perseverance required.\n\nThe main story arc, the characters, the New Orleans setting, each element complements the other creating an absorbing and highly entertaining point and click adventure.\n\n\nVoodoo Magic\n\nI've thoroughly enjoyed my time revisiting Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, it's left me with a hunger for more and I sincerely hope that "GK2: The Beast Within" and "GK3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned" get their much deserved HD makeovers too.\n\nIf you weren't lucky enough (or old enough) to play the original Sins of the Fathers  there's never been a better time to get to know Gabriel Knight in all his HD glory.\n\nIf you were around for the original and remember it fondly (as I do) then I'm happy to say that this is a re-master done the right way.\n\nSt George's book store is open...\nYou really can go home again.\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/  )","March 20, 2015","true","1.3"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","14","19","7","0"

For starters , Gabriel's voice is not very good but you're getting used to during the game along with all the other voices who are also rerecorded with new voice actors .But as i played through the game i could't help but immerse into the stunning world of 1993 New Orleans which is so wonderfully portrayed in this remake.\n\nJane Jensen not only did remake the original GK, she made it better in every way . The graphics are incredibly beautifull , the 3d models needed a little extra work but its not something that even remotely bothers, the locations are incredible the least i can say. The gameplay is totaly reworked adding minigames to enhance the gaming experience and to help the plot develop smoothier than the original. Only few can be said about the music which is a key element to the atmosphere of the GK and in my humble opinion Robert Holmes's score delivers. The passion and the colouring of the soundtrack is something that other adventure companies can take lessons from.\n\nOn the other hand a few bugs kinda spoil the whole experience (most of them are fixed now) but nothing can stop the remake of GK to mark a new benchmark on how an andventure should be made and yes it may be a wonderfull apetizer for a 4th installment of the series.","November 9, 2014","true","17.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Since adventure games are having something of a reinassance these last few years, I was hoping one of my old favorites would survive the remake transition.  This return to New Orleans is not without its charm and the gameplay system has welcome hint integration, but the overall execution is lacking.\n\nThe biggest issue stems from the new voice cast.  Since CD games were a fresh novelty in the early '90s some ringers from stage and cinema hopped onboard to see what the fuss was about.  This resulted in an interesting mix of seriocomic vocal perormances from the likes of Tim Curry and Mark Hamill.  The voices in the remake turn the cheese factor up considerably to the point where it detracts from the tension built into the dialogue.  The laughs from the original came from a welcome break in the tension, not because Gabriel's accent sounds like a awkward college student pretending to be someone else.\n\nThe character models are also a bit off.  Their movements are really stilted, coming across more as PSX-era Clock Tower quality animations.  They don't fare much better up close as each portrait looks like they've got a constant case of the jitters.  Yes, people don't stand perfectly still when they talk, but they also don't have minor convulsions like they all had the same strong espresso in the morning.  No one's eyes line up when they speak, heightening the disconnect from the characters and scenario.  One of the things I loved about the original was the way the conversation switched to the two characters having a dialogue straight into the player's eyeline from the monitor to engage them in conversation.\n\nJane Jensen's story still works great, and while Gabriel Knight is even more of a anachronistic character than he was when he debuted, is still charming enough to guide through the story.  Gameplay-wise, there are additions positive and negative to the core adventure system.  In the big positive corner is a hint book that runs alongside the game and disperses guidance as the player needs, providing more specific solutions depending on the scenario.  It's not perfect, and there are some notable glitches with what actions go where toward the end of the game, but it's a nice way to integrate appreciation for adventure gamer's of all skill levels.  Less effective is how the player can now hit Space Bar to put a text box over everything that can be interacted with on any given screen.  For pixel hunts it's a godsend, for screens where there is just a lot of flavor dialogue to peruse it's a nightmare.  It transforms the pleasing background environments into a text adventure and disrupts more of the careful flow.\n\nOverall it wasn't worth the price of admission.  It's not bad, just buffed to near-perfection in some areas and left lackluster in the rest.","January 23, 2015","false","7.8"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","22","37","0","3"

The graphics look good, the music is as brooding as I can remember, and the story is just as engaging as I can remember.\n\nIf I had to pick a complaint, it would be that the voice acting isn't quite as good as the original.  I just can't get behind this Gabriel as much as Tim Curry's Gabriel.  Then again, I certainly realize that those voice actors would cost quite a bit and undoubtedly don't sound the same.\n\nWith that said, if you're a fan of the original I strongly recommend you check this version out.  If you played the original when it came out, then prepare to enjoy a bit of nostalgia, and then feel old.\n","October 17, 2014","true","12.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","2"

Everything is faithfully recreated, but it's also extremely approachable for any fan of adventure gaming in general. The story is top-notch, comparable to a very good novel.\n\nWhat I liked is that they balanced out the activities in each of the days, so that each day you have a clear set of objectives and a few side objectives. The voice acting is solid but admittedly not as exciting as the first game which featured heavyweight voice talents like Tim Curry, Mark Hamill and Leah Remini (before she was famous!).\n\nFor people who have played prior games from Pinkerton (Moebius) or Phoenix (Cognition), this game shows some progression by the development team. The animations are now done using motion-capture so they are not as offensive as the ones from those games. The engine is still not quite as good as the old Sierra engine was, and responsiveness can be a bit slow as times. But overall it is not a major distraction.\n\nThis is the best way to jump into the series at this point, and to relive a piece of gaming history. Highly recommend, can't go wrong with this game if you have any love of engaging stories, crime solving, supernatural and history - this is the game for you.","October 19, 2014","true","12.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The fade in and out scenes were part of the original game, and the added feature to just go to the map from the menu bar is a nice little feature. The added puzzles and how some events and items are re-arranged gives veteran players of the series a bit more of a challenge.\n\nThe character portraits while speaking with characters was a feature of the original game. They could have been done a little better, but I am not going to go off on a tirade and say they are god awful. The voice acting, I can see what they were going for. They were trying to be as faithful to the original version of the game as possible. I appreciate the effort of the new voice actors, as they had to live up to high expectations.\n\nI have encountered a bug where I will pick up the envelope from the police station, and its contents disappear, along with anything else I picked up earlier (the hair-gel and the black shirt). I had to go back and re-play picking up all of these items and keep my fingers crossed that they stay in my inventory or show up on the day that they will be needed for.\n\nAside from the bug and minor 3D problems (sometimes Gabriel's foot will go through the counter at St. George's Books, a minor irk) , the game is incredibly faithful to the original. The new puzzles are a welcome addition, and the cut-scenes appearing like a graphic novel are just beautiful. I recommend this game to those who play the original, or those who would like a trip back to 1993, when Adventure games were in their glory.\n","October 16, 2014","true","10.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It was, and indeed still is a pretty dark game.  Bringing in ritualistic murder with voodoo trappings and a story of... ah, I won't spoil it.\n\nThe major complaint some people had with the game before this remake was even made was that the original voice actors were not available.  Let's face it, 20 years on they probably wouldn't have sounded the same, though the first time I heard Gabes voice I tried not to think of Tim Curry and it was a bit jarring at first but either I quickly got used to it or his voice settled down.  Whoever replaced Charity James as Grace Nakimura did an admirable job though she doesn't quite have the snark.\n\nA nice touch is that in every scene you can look at an 'archive', like a production section and there are things like a comparison shot of the old version of the game with the new section, concept drawings, a few video interviews.\n\nThe game interface is a little less clumsy than the original Sierra interface and overall I thoroughly enjoyed it.  When talking to a character the close up portraits are nice, though I think Magentia Moonbean looks a bit younger than the game suggests.\n\nIt's not perfection, there are certain characters you could visit freely before like Grandma that are only accessible after a certain day and a couple of silly little puzzles, but if you're an adventure fan I recommend this.","October 24, 2014","true","11.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The biggets issue is the 3D, where some animations can look awkward at times (especially when characters transition from one animation to another).\n\nAll in all, I greatly enjoyed this remake and I think anyone who enjoys adventure games will enjoy this one as well whethe rthey played the original or not.","October 20, 2014","true","12.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Same game basically (small changes to the ordering of some days and a few new puzzles are pretty minor) with a much nicer look.  Phoenix Online still can't do consistently competent character animations , so people look stupid walking around a few times (Mosely's office when he goes to get Gabriel coffee in particular is ridiculous), but it's not as prevalent an issue as in Moebius or Cognition.  Voice acting is quite good overall, and the music remains outstanding.  New Gabriel voice is just fine.  Tim Curry was pretty over the top ridiculous  at times in the original, and the new guy is at least as good by comparison.  Other voices are uniformly solid.  Unlike walking animations, which POS has so much trouble with, talking head animations are quite nice, though the new Gabriel head model is a bit generic.  Updated artwork is well done.  The comparisons in the extras included with the game, where they overlay the super low resolution old versions on top of the new ones, really illustrate how much improvement there's been.

If I'd never played the original, I might think differently on that.\n\nThat said, this is like comparing steaks; even though this game's New York Strip isn't quite comparable to the original's Filet Mignon, it's still a deliciously worthwhile $20 purchase both for fans and for those who've never played the original Gabriel Knight.

Granted, Tim Curry playing a good ol' Cajun gent with the body of a 12-year old boy (in-game reference) was a little off-putting, but I've always been a fan of the 'So-bad-it's-good' school of doing things. The story was darker than most Sierra titles at the time, and I was immediately hooked. Sadly, the older that game got, the harder it was to run on progressively newer machines.\n\nBut then, there were two. This new version is appropriately advanced in form and function. There are a few new puzzles, and entirely new voice cast. Rather than reinvent the wheel, the new cast attempts with differing levels of success, to emulate the original cast. I actually found Malia's VO to be fairly weak, and the Dragon soundd kinda 'eh', but all in all, it was a splendid auditory experience. The updates make sense, and I love what Jane and Co have done to give the game a richer, more vibrant NOLA feel. Robert Holmes' remastered soundtrack is awesome as ever, though I do miss the original St. George's theme. Except for a few weird bugs, my time playing the game (two consecutive playthroughs thusfar) has been largely very enjoyable.\n\nFor fans of Sierra's old school adventure games, and/or fans of occult/horror adventure games, whether or not they are Sierra fans, this title should be a no-brainer. The puzzles are logic-based, but fairly simple, and the game will probably leave a lasting impression. It did for me.

As such, its biggest danger is comparison to "itself."  It does a very good job in that respect.  The new graphics are excellent.  The new voice acting is *very* good; I think that the critics on that point are more entrenched in cripplingly specific nostalgia than anything else.  The things that stand out as most noticably changed are solidly changed for the better.  The new castle design is a huge improvement over the cartoony original and links to GK2 fantastically.  The brief but powerful story edits at the police station are wonderful.  The only change I do have mixed feelings about is the much more rigorous pacing control seen in this version.  The original version generally resulted in a painfully difficult and long Day 1, but then rocketed up the tension and pace in later days.  I do think that this new story structure will avoid the risk of seriously alienating first time players, assuming that they're avoiding hints.

The pacing of the game starts out PAINFULLY slow and uneventful but it really comes together and picks up quite nicelly after a third way through, making the truging through the beginning quite worth it.\n\nThe puzzles in this game from pretty easy to vague and you have to be clair voyant to guess them but fortunately there are very few of those. I only found myself resorting to the inbuilt hints 3 or 6 times in my play through and usually just to nudge me in the right direction.\n\nOverall, I was quite happy with this game, was playing it compulsively around the end and would probably buy the sequels if Phenix Online ever remakes them. May even by the original Sequels if they don't","February 16","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wasn't wrong.\n\nThe remake is competent enough.  Many of the visuals - which is the key thing the remake has been sold on - are very pretty and the cutscenes in particular are excellent (though I would have liked a way to disable the speech balloons).  The voice acting is solid and, once I got used to the new voices, very much enjoyed them,  The story and characters still hold up while - for the most part - the puzzles are not too obtuse.  There are some animation issues and the quality of the backgrounds is not always consistent (I really don't like Jackson Square at all) but I didn't find these things too problematic.  So if you enjoy adventure games and have never played the original, then I suspect you will find the game worth the price of entry.\n\nBut if you *have* played the original game I'd suggest caution, for at least in my case the remake does not improve upon it and, in fact, is inferior in several ways.  Critical here are the visuals.  While the original game managed to produce a mood perfect for the story through its dark backgrounds and strong use of contrast, the brightness and colour of the backgrounds in the remake fail to do the same.  An exception here must be made for the cutscenes which, in contrast, do an excellent job capturing the mood of the story.  Yet, ironically, this only serves to highlight the absence of atmosphere in the rest of the game.  This is most clearly demonstrated in the final scene (no spilers) which slips between cutscenes and regular gameplay.  Here, the cutscenes do all of the work while each shift back to regular gameplay spoils the tension that has been produced by them.\n\nIn addition to this, changes in the pacing of the game also disrupt its mood.  Access to areas of the game is more staggered than in the original, which helps spread out the content of the game more evenly but also - for me anyway - takes away from the world-building at the outset of the game.  Moreover, minor additions to the game's content (a few small puzzles and scenes) are often out of place and stand out as obvious bolt-ons with little or no necessity (the very minor scene at the Wright family tomb, for example, left me astounded by its pointlessness).  I also found the music disappointing compared with the original (though perhaps this is simply because I grew up in the '90s and have acquired an unreasonable fondness for midi tracks!).\n\nHow to conclude, then?  If you like adventure games and have never played the original, you should buy this.  If you have played the original and are interested (like me) in seeing first hand how the game was reworked, or if you would like to play Gabriel Knight again but find its old interface or graphics a deal-breaker, then you should buy the game.  But if you are wanting this game to recapture the spirit and character of the original, then I do not recommend it.  Or else, I recommend that you be braced for disappoinment.","October 20, 2014","true","12.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I would also mention Grace, Dr John, Mosely and Frick as outstanding performances.\n\nVisually its a balanced mix of photo and painted textures, blended with pre-rendered backgrounds and real-time props & characters. A nice touch is the ambient atmospheric particles & lighting effects.\n\nThe original music is remastered by composer Robert Holmes. This is a huge improvement from the early 90s midi tracks.\n\nThe bonus option to view old concept art from the different locations, combined with info and audio interviews with the original developers is a nice addition for fans of the old game.\n\nI would highly recommend this game for adventure fans, looking for a story driven game.

To this day, the original Gabriek Knight: Sins of the Father remains my favourite adventure gamel (and overall favourite game). So I was hesitant to try this remake, especially after the disappointing Moebius.\n\nHowever, I greatly enjoyed this. I still prefer the original, but this remake has its merits.\n\nIn short? I recommend the original game, which you can get on Good Old Games. It's a good remake, but not worth full price. It's worth getting on a sale, though.\n\nPros:\n-Fantastic graphics and art design. The character and location remodels are drop-dead gorgeous. They're a massive improvement to the original game. Where the game especially shines is in the panelled, graphic novel style cutscenes that made the original game so memorable. All are recreated with gusto and there are many more new ones that turn previous in-game cutscenes into the graphic novel style. The updated graphics and art style alone are worth the price of admission.\n-The voice work is quite good. I was worried, since Phoenix Online couldn't use the original voice work, but the new cast does a fine job. For the most part. I'll get to that.\n-A small handful of puzzles have been reworked. About half a dozen. Two, in particular, are very nice changes: where Gabriel needs to change his looks, and somewhere he needs to break into.The latter is incredibly creepy.\n\nCons:\n-Some animations are awkward. Sometimes, the characters stifly spin on the spot like "tank controls" of older 3D third person games. They're rare, fortunately. There are other moments where the 3D animation is choppy or awkward, but it's still a massive improvement from Moebius.\n-While most of the voice acting is good, there are times it feels very stiff and unnatural compared to the original game. Little, intricate details in line delivery is lost at times. I loved Tim Curry's delivery of a German poem, but this voice actor's delivery is very deadpan. Some of Mark Hamil's little ways of spicing up Mosely's characters are lost, which hurts the character's presentation. I'm biased, though, given my love for the original.\n-As I said, about half a dozen puzzles have been redone. Some, unfortunately, have absolutely infuriating, immersion-breaking logic puzzles like something out of Myst. One puzzle gives little indication of what to do (a tiny, barely readable guide in a the bottom corner of the screen). They feel completely out of place with the rest of the game and are only a nuisance than anything else.","October 19, 2014","true","9.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You can argue that it looks better, sounds better because of the original Hollywood cast, and maybe even plays better.\n\nBut all that said, the 20th anniversary edition of the game is a perfectly fine version to play if you want something that is a bit more modern.  Built in hints, some light commentary on each screen of the game, and some UI overhauls make the game a bit more accessible than the original.  As a remake, it's well done.\n\nBut regardless of which version you pick up, Gabriel Knight is unequivocally one of the best adventure games in the genre.  You play as the eponymous Gabriel Knight, a novelist who gets involved with a series of murders in New Orleans.  As Gabriel learns more about the case, he also learns more about his own mysterious past, including the madness that claimed his father's life.  It's a compelling combination of a crime procedural with the supernatural world of Voodoo and Gabriel's dark and mysterious past.  It really is a great story to watch/read through, and it's the reason why Jane Jensen and this game in particular is celebrated among adventure game fans.\n\nThe adventure game part of it is fun as well, with some clever puzzles and interesting solutions.  There's nothing as frustrating as the infamous Gabriel Knight 3 mustache puzzle, so you don't have to worry about getting stuck.  And even if you do get stuck, the hint system in the game will get you moving on to the next great story beat if you just want to move on and experience the story.\n\nThis game is a classic and definitely worth playing if you have any interest in the genre.

This is a moody adventure game with a rich story and fun puzzle elements. It does suffer from a few graphical glitches, but it's not a major issue. When I played the first couple chapters, I wasn't hooked with the story and setting, but once things started picking up and strange incidents started affecting characters it kept me hooked. The game felt a little clunky mechanically, but when I set it on Fastest mode, it was fine. It seems to be quite intensive on medium-high settings. I definitely recommend this game to adventure game fans.\n\nPros:\n+ Rich intriguing story\n+ Good voice acting\n+ Puzzles aren't overly frustrating\n\nCons:\n- A few graphical glitches","July 26, 2015","true","15.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This was the very first PC game I ever had, actually bought 2 months before we actually had a PC. I still remember seeing the box art, that hanging figure and being strangely drawn to it. It was also one of the hardest games I ever tried to run on our first PC. Figuring out that I needed to create a boot disk and what that disk needed to contain was as hard a puzzle as any I had to solve in the game! And considering this was before the Internet gave us all the answers, still a proud moment for me. Most of my DOS/Command Line skills were learned trying to run this game, skills that I still use to this day. And if ever I actually write a horror story, this game will have had it's hand in this as well.\n\nThe 20th Anniversary Edition comes with glossy modern graphics, new voice acting and the story we all loved 20 years ago. It also comes with the same point-and-click gameplay it originally had. Whereas some would qualify it as classic, others would call this style of gameplay archaic. The action is slow with you clicking on something and waiting for the animation to bring the character there before doing whatever you were asking. Puzzles, which make up the bulk of the challenges, are a mixed bag. Though you'll find many to work intuitively, some are obtuse, and a few are horribly frustrating. Luckily, a new hint system was imbedded in the menu structure to give a helping hand when you need it without having to resort to the net (or a certain guide...). Unfortunately, the worst offenders require trial and error and a good bit of luck to solve, even if you know the answer. These bog down the game and will lead some to never finish the title. Which would be quite a shame. On a plus side, they modernized the interface. Though we lost the nice, atmospheric icons of the original, changing it from having them all grouped up at the top of the screen to a direct contextual ring upon selection is definitely a move that needed to be made.\n\nAs I stated, the graphics were changed. Gone is the pixel art of the original. In it's stead we have new 3D High Res graphics to play with. Overall, the new graphics are rather pretty and well made, with generally smooth animation in the movements and interactions. However, I do miss the original and wish a “classic” mode had been included (though I'm not sure if they could have done this legally). Your millage may vary but players used to modern day graphics should appreciate the update. Each locale you visit is interesting, distinct and memorable and the art team did a great job of updating these. New Orleans really comes to life, from the French quarter to the bayou. Note that I did notice a few, very minor, graphical issues in my play-through. The game also features a few cutscenes. These, part graphic novel and part animation, are truly stunning works to behold.\n\nOne update that I'm very happy with is the music. Re-orchestrated and re-mastered by the original composer, Robert Holmes, it is one of the highlights of this experience. I liked the music back when it was played through a not-Sound Blaster, so you can imagine how much I love the updated tracks. Luckily, I per-ordered the game and received the original sound track as a bonus. Each location you visit has a distinct musical track associated with it, giving as much to the games atmosphere as the visuals. It's so that you could almost play the game with you're eyes closed. I wish more games today would go the extra mile and bring the aural part of their games on par with the visuals like this one.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, the voice acting is something I have trouble with. Now, this isn't to question the change in cast members. The game originally featured such talent as Tim Curry, Mark Hamil and Michael Dorn. With a low budget and 20 year old recordings, they had to get some new actors. For the most part, I felt the players were fine. Unfortunately, the two main voices you'll hear in the game, Gabriel and the narrator, are points of contention. I originally played the game on floppy disks, so I had no voice acting. So all I had was my imagination as to what our protagonist sounded like. What you hear in game is about a thousand leagues away from that. I don't feel it fits the character all that well but I did get used to it. Of course, upon looking up what the original sounded like, I can't say I Tim Curry was any closer to my imagination either. The narrator is another situation as well. They kept the same idea as the original, a New Orleans accented lady to add to the atmosphere. But yeah, no, I can't say it was that great of an idea on either case. At times, the narrator sounds tired or bored and the rest of the time the accent just gets grating, especially when you can't find the solution to a puzzle. Of course, you can always mute the narrator if you'd like. Still, as stated, the rest of the voice acting was fine.\n\nFor me, the highest of the high points in this game is the story and characters. The story is fully enjoyable, blending elements of magic and occultism from the old world and the new in a fashion that's still pretty unique. The things you do and the places you visit and why all form a very interesting arc between good and evil, past and present, and love and duty. The main characters are likewise well developed and realized, showing more than one trope or dimension. I played through this more than once when I was young and still enjoyed the story and characters this time around.\n\nUltimately, this version of the game suffers from the same problems and issues that it has always suffered from. And I'm not sure how authentic it would have been if they had been removed. I can say that if you're a fan of old school point-and-click adventure games and their unique sense of logic, or if you were a fan of the original but can't play it anymore cause one of the disk died on you (still sad about it), you should check this out. But this isn't the adventure that's going to change your mind if you don't like this kind of game.","October 23, 2014","true","14.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Not terrible.\n\nPositives:\n\nThere's a solid foundation here. The original is an extremely good game, and the remake (for the most part) doesn't mess it up, but rather improves it.\n\nThe more detailed art style does improve some things, such as the cinematic cutscenes and confrontations.\n\nSome of the locations are a bit more interesting.\n\nThe commentary is good.\n\nThe narrator doesn't take forever to finish each torturous sentence (you will still turn her off, naturally)\n\nGrace's voice is far superior to the original.\n\nNegatives:\n\nSome of the locations are quite sterile. A lot of minor animations and touches are omitted for the sake of economy. Fewer spots you can interact with, fewer unique reactions.\n\nMost of the new voices are adequate, but don't quite measure up to Worf / Joker.\n\nThe commentary is quite sparse. I'd actually prefer a proper artbook, where you can see the comparisons in detail and the designers would (hopefully) have things to say beyond the very obvious.\n\nThe new puzzles are terrible, awful, horrible, time wasting pointless ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOverall:\n\nUnlike some other remakes or sequels to 20 year old games I played recently, I did not regret the time I spent playing this game. It wasn't bad. Just... not very good.  Remember that the original trilogy can be purchased on GOG, and... wait for a sale, maybe?\n\nDetailed impressions: http://xander77.livejournal.com/25366.html\n\nEdit - I've been told that this review is a bit biased towards people who played the original back in the 90's, and don't mind 90's graphics much. Fair enough - if you don't mind somewhat dated puzzle style (the game wasn't really updated in that sense) and would prefer moder-ish graphics, then this is highly recommended. Or, at least more highly recommended that the original version on GOG.","January 24, 2015","true","26.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I played the original and all of its sequels when they first came out and even though i remembered roughly how the plot would flow, it was still fun and atmospheric to redo it, and a satisfying trip down my gaming memory lane.\n\nInitially, i found the strength of Gabriels accent really annoying, and some of the lines really cheesy, but as i played that mattered less and less, and I focussed on the nicer graphics, story and plot.\n\nThere is a really useful hints function within your in-game diary that prevents the annoying stagnation and walls you can sometimes hit in puzzle/adventure games. There are two levels of hints. The first level is a gentle one, and wont completely steal the satisfaction of solving the puzzle or days tasks. The second level hint, if you use it, is a much more detailed "cheat", that will state plainly whats required. There is a timer function that prevents you clicking the hints straight away.\n\nI really enjoyed replaying this game, partly out of pure nostalgia, and partly because it is a worthwhile modernisation of a fondly remembered game. I was especially satisfied by the art material and graphics from the original game being viewable within your in game diary also. That content gets unlocked as you progress.\n\nIf you have love for the original, and would simply enjoy replaying it with new clothes, buy this game (again).

This means the loss of celebrity voice talent present in the original, but I think the improved audio fidelity makes up for it (feel free to look up the originals on youtube and hear for yourself).\nThe scenery, dialogue content, plot and puzzles are kept identical to the original. The game contains a journal in which you can view developer interviews, sketches, story-boards and screenshots for the original. I found myself looking in the journal to compare the old and new first thing at every location in the game. It's clearly a very nostalgic experience. Since the game features a higher resolution more details have been woven into the background in many areas, but the core gameplay is just as it is in the original.\nGabriel's appearance seems to change for every game he's in and the 20th Anniversary Edition is no different. I think his features have become slightly too androgynous though (my mental image of him is formed by the original), but whether it's better or not is entirely subjective.\n\nFor the newcomer to the series the 20th Anniversary edition is clearly preferable to the original, which is probably much too pixelated to be appreciated by eyes used to HD graphics.\nThis is an inventory based point-and-click adventure game: Gabriel moves between various areas in which he can observe, pick up items, manipulate items, combine items, use items upon objects and talk to people. You progress through the game by unlocking unique dialogue options uncovering important plot points and solving puzzles which usually involves the use of found items. You can use a highlight feature to show interactable objects on the screen, which is rather convenient at times reducing paranoia "what if I missed something? Better search every pixel again!"\nThe puzzles sometimes requires strange solutions but the game has a built in hint system, where you can unlock tiers of hints (increasing in details) to prevent frustration.\nThe game is deservedly loved for its story among fans, but you might not believe it from the first few hours of gameplay. The mystery plot takes a bit before it gets going. The games humor is mostly self-depreciating on Gabriel's behalf and tends to portray him as a shallow person, which might feel slightly off-putting initially. Same may apply for some of the accents used in the game, but after short habituation I found it rather refreshing and atmospheric.\n\n\nBottom line: Faithful recreation of the original game with updated assets. Slow paced but very worthwhile mystery plot with sometimes weird puzzles.

I remember to have played the original game very young, solving puzzles and having conversations that I really didn't even understand at the time. It was nice and exciting adventure back then and it still works very well. The story takes you in its grasp and forces you to explore more everytime you play.\n\nThe puzzles are good and logical most of the time. For some players the old adventure game playing mechanism might be little stiff, but for me it still works nicely. For the players who have also played the original game there are also some extra illustrations and sketches from the old game and interviews of the game developers which are very interesting.\n\nAs for cons you might consider voice acting, which is mostly pretty solid, but Gabriel's voice started to annoy me in some point. Maybe it's just me. I managed to live with it though so that's not really a problem. Still a great story and a great game for every point and click adventure gaming friend out there.

I, for one, don't enjoy something like being able to show all hotspots by just pressing the space bar, The small number of additional puzzles were unnecessary but that didn't really bother me. The pronounciation of the New Orleans French was overdone. And I rather disliked the "Scoring System".\nIt just distracts from playing this for story-progression and replaces it with an achievement-hunter vibe. The Hints-system was an addition I chose to ignore but I understand why it's been added, Gaming has become a HUGE deal and gamers aren't as patient with their games as they used to be (especially when it's not an action-packed game) so without some small hints, some players might not bother completing the game, I don't want to complain about the hints system, It's just present, If you don't like it you can just let it sit idle (Nobody forces you to use it). My biggest issue in this game was the rather unresponsive controlling of Gabriel, especially in the Wheel-within-a-wheel mound in Africa, (Y'all know what sequence i mean, I don't want to spoil) But all these minor "Issues' just don't add up to the sheer amazingness of the story, or the game as a whole! The price is also not too steep for a game that will keep you occupied for several hours (I blasted through this rather quickly, but I played the original just a couple of months ago) I rate this remake a solid 9/10.","November 4, 2014","true","12.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sadly, they couldn't get Tim Curry, Leah Remini, Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. to reprise their roles, and there are extended sequences that prevent simply reusing the original voice samples.\n\nIf you've never played a Gabriel Knight game, you will most likely enjoy the updated version.  If you're a fan of the original series, you might want to pass unless you get this on sale/as a gift, then why not because trading cards = free money.\n\nThings that are legitimately improved:\n- Gabe's design is more consistent with his look in the original 2nd and 3rd games\n- the cutscenes are a little more coherent\n- the "point of no return" in Day 10 has been changed so you can go back if needed\n\nThings that have tolerably changed:\n- Jason Victor does a pretty good version of Tim Curry's Gabriel Knight\n- Ned Clarke and Dave Fennoy also come pretty close to the original Mosely and Dr. John\n- a handful of bonus mini-game extended puzzles that make no sense but at least it's bonus material\n- exhausting dialogue choices (usually) removes them from the list of options vs. leaving them to clutter the screen\n- MOST of the artwork is pretty\n\nThings I really don't like:\n- Cissy Jones sounds more like Charity James (original GK3) than Leah Remini\n- Amy Ingersol's Malia sounds much less sultry than Leilani Jones\n- the "bobble-head" interview animations look incredibly unnatural\n- the character animations in general have that typical stiff, soulless puppet look, particularly with sequences that would need sudden movements (the tap-dancing kid, Magentia's "don't be frightened by what you see" snake dance that instead looks like "I'm wearing a snake and slightly shaking in place")\n- a bug where I put two "snake tiles" in place and was IMMEDIATELY ATTACKED (may or may not be reproducible, I haven't tried extensively)\n- also, what's with Grace's walk cycle--it looks like she's gonna fall over any second\n\nOverall, I guess it's okay, but don't go too far out of your way to get it.

I was a kickstarter backer & played some of the earlier builds of the game.  When I was playing those early builds I was concerned about the voice cast, but after playing through the whole game, I give a hearty thumbs up for an impressive job at filling some incredibly large shoes left by the original cast.  All of the voices are definitely based off the original, and even the worst of it doesn't detract much (if at all) from the game.

I loved the original themes and while they are there have at times been reworked and do not hit me the same way, but were never so far out of place that I found myself thinking them just plain wrong. The puzzles have been given a once-over in some ways.  Not everything takes place or at the same time in the original, and this doesn’t hurt things.  If anything, most of the puzzles are too easy, but then that could be a lot of memory from previous playthroughs shining through.  There are plenty of hints through the story, dialog, journal and activities so that if you’re paying attention it shouldn’t be overly hard.\n\nIt is the story that still shines the most.  All the rest is the delivery of this tale which has been a favorite since Gabriel first walked out of his bedroom in St. George’s Books. And while there are a few differences in how the story is told, it is still interesting if you will take the time to discover it.\n\nIn short, while not perfect, it makes many improvements that make for an enjoyable experience for someone who has played the game a few times over the last 20 years or someone who is being introduced to the world of Gabriel Knight.\n","September 15, 2015","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I loved the original themes and while they are there have at times been reworked and do not hit me the same way, but were never so far out of place that I found myself thinking them just plain wrong. The puzzles have been given a once-over in some ways.  Not everything takes place or at the same time in the original, and this doesn’t hurt things.  If anything, most of the puzzles are too easy, but then that could be a lot of memory from previous playthroughs shining through.  There are plenty of hints through the story, dialog, journal and activities so that if you’re paying attention it shouldn’t be overly hard.\n\nIt is the story that still shines the most.  All the rest is the delivery of this tale which has been a favorite since Gabriel first walked out of his bedroom in St. George’s Books. And while there are a few differences in how the story is told, it is still interesting if you will take the time to discover it.\n\nIn short, while not perfect, it makes many improvements that make for an enjoyable experience for someone who has played the game a few times over the last 20 years or someone who is being introduced to the world of Gabriel Knight.\n","September 15, 2015","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Figure out what that means and tell me you don't want to play this game... these words have haunted me for almost 20 years...not kidding.\n\nI fondly remember my days spent indoors, during incredibly hot summer days in Georgia, playing Sierra games. They were such amazing adventure games and something altogether different from my console titles (SNES at the time I think). But stumbling upon Gabriel Knight really has remained as my first discovery of a "sleeper" hit game. Knowing now that the main devs involved were partly responsible for King's Quest and Phantasmogoria makes total sense and a perfect way to describe this game: the gameplay of KQ mixed with the dark and sinister spector of Phantas.\n\nThe tale of Voodoo, murder and noir dectective skewed N'awlins style is a true classic. The author of the script really did a great job capturing the flavor of the south (sometimes moreso than the voice actors...), and as a southerner I can tell you that is not an easy thing to do. The dynamic of the characters is well crafted, and the tale is tense and masterful. Morover, I love the film "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" and this game certianly has a similar "Southern Gothic" feeling. The bizarre cast of characters, wrought iron fences, the sweet smell of magnolia and gardenia, the heavy wet air of New Orleans, the general ease that the old South did once proffer, and a glimpse into the darkest shadows surrounding some of the best kept secrets haunting the opulent manors and old money that flow in the veins of old surviving Southern towns and cities.\n\nIt has depth in both story and gameplay, but some may not really enjoy the point and click play. It can also get a little repetitive; having to travel around and explore places you've alreday been to just to try and find one thing or one detail about one thing you missed...it can bug you. Also, one of the classic faults (if you can call it that) of old Sierra games was the quality of the backgrounds sort of hiding, or at least obscuring, the paths the player needs to find. Also, some gamers may not understand the whole "open the inventory to combine items to equip them all/get them to work" sort of problem solving required to solve some puzzles, if they can find the puzzle to begin with- looking at you clock puzzle... Trust me, if you play this game you'll find it. Truthfully; that's what I love about the games, but I admit that it isn't eveyone's cup of tea- you have to spend time IN the game. Click on everything, explore every corner...and the new option to press a button to reveal all interactable objects is AWESOME... you used to have to click blindly until you got a GUI box to pop up.\n\nIt's a great game you 90's gamers may have missed and one newer gamers may never hear of again!

If you have played the original you should have no bother completing the puzzles, because the changes are minor.\n\nIf you haven't played Gabriel Knight before then all the better, this remake should help pull in the new wave of point and click adventure fans created by indie developers who have gone back to my favourite genre. These remakes of classics (Broken Sword Enhanced version, Monkey Island remake) sit well along with new games (Walking Dead, Broken Age) which have brought back adventure games.\n\nI just hope this provides the springboard for new Gabriel Knight adventures (I'm not interested in remakes of the second or third game!)","May 16, 2015","true","17.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Being an adventure game fan, I've heard good things about it, and I was stoked.\n\nLet me start off by saying that the theme is really interesting, a welcomed change of pace.\nIt's rare to find games that feature voodoo, cajun, or New Orleans culture in a respectful manner.\n\nI think in the 90s, Gabriel Knight was hailed as a cutting-edge franchise because it was a modern noir murder mystery story set in New Orleans, featuring POC characters, and it was quite violent for a video game at the time - a point & click, no less.\n\nWith that chunk of history in mind, and the 17+ hours I've spent playing the game, it's safe to say that it is pretty good!\n\nBut, I do have a bone or two to pick, and I'll explain why in detail.\n\nTo be honest, it was really difficult for me to really connect with Gabriel and appreciate him as a character; but, over time, I grew to appreciate the game and other characters, instead, and then it became much more enjoyable.\n\nI feel that the characters, music, and atmosphere is what really made the game for me and it was what kept me from uninstalling the game because I was so frustrated with Gabriel being little more than a womanizing dream boat - who falls in love with a woman after only knowing her for three days!\n(And she explicitly told him she was uninterested, at first)\n\nStory-wise, I felt that Gabriel was a flop, in the beginning at least, and I thought the love-at-first-sight and playing hard to get aspects were uncomfortable and unnatural (but it was a popular theme in 90's story-telling, I'll admit).\nAlso, Gabriel had very little character development up until the peak of the plot, which was disappointing because it made him seem even more of a pretty boy cut-out instead of the formidable hero he was - literally - destined to be.\n\nBut, my personal gripe aside, it was a good adventure game; I had fun with the puzzles and I enjoyed interacting with the characters, too! (Mosely and Grace were wonderful, I just wish that they were a bit more involved.)\n\nThis was a good remake, and I hope that the other two games will be redone so that they may have a chance to reconnect with old fans, and inspire new fans, as well.\n","June 3, 2015","true","17.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Voice talent may lack Curry but is very strong nevertheless. Gabriel+Grace are convincing but the narrator with her Cajun/Jamaican accent is probably my favorite. Great puzzle integration. Medium difficulty with nothing illogical. That said, keep an eye out on smaller objects, especially in the background. It's not a pixel hunt but as I said, each location is rich with artistic detail which can distract from what you need to interact with. The only thing I don't like in the game are the 1 or 2 arcade/timed sequences, which really don't fit within GK's grand adventure game universe.","June 14, 2015","true","20.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I never played the 1993 original. I knew it'd be point and click, but somehow I didn't expect it to be boring...but alas, it is. I was drawn to the mysterious voodoo infused storyline, and the screenshots looked nice. My problem is the gameplay is just plain boring.\n\nThere's all kinds of things to click on, but 90% have a road block stopping you from performing the option they offer. "Nope, sorry, can't do that!" One of the most disappointing times was when a hand symbol came up for "Grace", your hot helper at the book store. "Like I haven't tried" he says, not even attempting to cop a feel. Hey, if I want to risk sexual harassment in a game, let me. Ok, that's kind of a joke but almost every object that shows up as "interactive" has more restrictions than anything. I just want to tell the devs, "fine, so don't give me the option then!" Of course, then there wouldn't be anything to do, and that's my point, it merely looks like there's tons to do. You go outside onto the street and a map comes up with about five areas to explore, only problem is, most of them are closed or "not available at this time". How again is this supposed to be fun?\n\nAnother thing, WTF is up with Gabriel's voice actor? Sounds like an Elvis wannabe, just TERRIBLE!\n\nMaybe in 1993 this type of "teasery", for lack of a better term, was innovative but I simply don't find it entertaining...not when I play games like Bioshock Infinite, Batman Arkham City, Grand Theft Auto V, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and Tomb Raider 2013, to name a few. I'm 33 and love good, old-school, nastalgic games just like the next guy, but only games that hold up (the Descent games for example). The story kind of sounds cool, but I won't find out because I just don't want to play it anymore. The graphics are pretty nice for a point and click game, but that's about all I can say that's positive. My opinion is you should avoid if you have no prior experience playing the Gabriel Knight games...buy at your own risk.","August 26, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 20 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","3","20","0","2"

Dealing with the primary theme of Voodoo, it's easy to tell throughout the game that rather than a shallow Hollywood approach, extensive research was made to make its portrayal of the subject authentic. Whether it actually is or not I have no idea, but it at least feels that way through the 10 hours or so it'll take to play.\n\nIn the early 1990's this & similar titles such as Broken Sword pre-dated the rise in popularity of historical based thrillers from the likes of Dan Brown which arrived ten years later along with their subsequent movie adaptations. So fast forwarding to 2015, another ten years later,  new comers to this game might feel the original uniqueness of the premise a little played out.\n\nThis modern adapation of the original, has strayed away from the CGA style backgrounds and pixel art sprites of the original to a somewhat cheap looking 3D render engine with some backgrounds redrawn more painter-esque.\nI feel this kills the atmosphere & tension that was underlying the suspense & dread of the original, especially when it reguarly freezes up and characters perform odd actions (such as Gabriel lifting his telephone by what looks telekinesis).\n\nThe voice acting has also been redone, with Gabriel (originally by Tim Curry) now having a rather emotionless deep southern drawl. Initially grating, I did become accustomed towards it, but it's not a spot on the original voice. It's also missing (what was then) a star VA cast such as Mark Hamill, now replaced with unknowns. I presume the rights to the originals were too expensive to obtain but it suffers overall as a result. Audio cuts out before the dialogue lines are finished and the interface which could have actually done with an overhaul feels clunky and inefficient.\n\nThey've changed the character portraits and design of several characters. This may have been an attempt to make the game seem less dated, but as all the newspaper dates in game are still in 1994 I don't think Gabriel having his original era themed haircut is a problem that needed addressing.\n\nSome positives have been added such as developer commentary & a retry option for when you die, meaning that saving every 10 minutes isn't crucial (though you probably should anyway, this is a Sierra title after-all). The comic style cutscenes are also quite impressively done.\n\nWhile still one of the best point and click adventure games ever made, if you're not a newcomer to the genre & can appreciate the /feel/ that pixel art used to offer,  I'd recommend sticking with the original over this remake. If you're looking for a solid story with challenging but mostly fair and logical puzzles to solve then you won't go wrong with this modern, yet slightly flawed, take on a classic.","November 4, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is great and characters are great.\n2. The gameplay had me looking at the hints screen and even several times at walkthroughs. Certain things aren't --well enough-- explained -- or hinted at -- which leads you going to all the places and trying to figure out what the hell you are supposed to be doing.  Serveral times i had to try everything with everything and the answer had me going "He?! really?!".\n\nStill the game is great and enjoyable; so i'd still reccommend it.","April 3","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I won't lie, I'm overly obsessed. I went to New Orleans and visited every screenshot of the game, trying to relive it, with the OST playing on my walkman... yeah, it was a while ago. But it's why I'm a programmer now. The best marriage of art, story and technology I'd ever seen.\n\nThere are many like me, who have a passion for this game. Some love this remake. Some hate it. Let me tell you why I love it.\n\nIf you're new to the series, there is nothing to stop you from loving this. I don't know what to tell you, the story and acting and visuals are all superb. The puzzles can sometimes be a little odd, but the remake includes a hint system and other helpful features to prevent you from getting trapped.\n\nFor old fans, here's the deal. If you are unwilling to accept new actors and game changes then you may not enjoy it. But it contains tons and tons of behind the scenes GK material, and honestly I think the actors recreated their roles just fine. As a fan you owe it to yourself to play it, if only to support the future of this series.","March 30","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While technically there's nothing much complain, the 3D reimagination lacks stylization and atmosphere of the original. As a result, the 3D art feels very sterile and soul-less, as if it had been entirely outsourced to an external company moving mechanically through the motions, having very little involvement in what they had been building.\n\nVoiceover is well done and asides from a few kinks acceptable to the ear. Performances of individual actors are quite agreeable, but fail to fill the huge shoes of the original cast of Tim Curry, Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, Virginia Capers and others.  Particuarly the role of Gabriel performed by Tim Curry was so excellent that lack of it in the remake is quite off-putting.\n\nOn a personal note, i'd much rather see a remake of GK3 which was really interesting story-wise but features horrible 3D graphics.","May 19","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The 20th Anniversary Edition remake is in full 3d but maintains all the charm and wit of the original.  A few puzzles have been slightly reworked and the voice acting has been redone, but none of that detracts from the overall experience, although the new Gabriel did take a bit to "find his voice".  Naturally, there is also a heap of extra content, including before/after art, interviews, and retrospectives.\n\nA definite "must" for any old fans or new ones to come.","April 10","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My father loved them so he kept purchasing new titles as they came out. I thoroughly loved all of Larry, Police Quest, Kings Quest, Quest for Glory and Conquests.\n\nWhen Gabriel Knight hit the shelves, I was hooked. Never have I been so immersed in a story, or so hooked on an adventure-game. I hold the original as one of the top games I have ever played, regardless of genre.\n\nNaturally I was psyched when I learned about the anniversary-remake, but had mixed feelings. The last thing I wanted to do was to taint my precious memories.\nI feel they did everything right. The kept to the original as much as possible, whith a few twists and added puzzles here and there, but nothing that ruined the pace of the game. This was a worthy remake. Graphics and music included.\nThe Gabriel Knight theme still, to this day, give me chills and goosebumps.\n\nThis game is recommended both for returning oldies like myself and new ones that are used to much more updated graphics than the one from the 90's.","June 6","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
