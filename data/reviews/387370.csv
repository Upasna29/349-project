Humans have at last advanced beyond sending astronauts to the moon, we are now capable of sending humans to Mars. You are in charge of the first mission to Mars, it’s your job to choose a suitable location on the Martian surface and establish a self-sufficient colony. You’ll need to manage your resources while expanding your colony and performing research. If you run out of food and/or water your astronauts and colonists will perish. This is a momentous event for all of humanity, make sure you don’t screw up!\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.\n\nPresentation\nBeing a small game, Sol 0 is modest in appearance. The overall appearance of the game is solid, it’s all high quality and the graphics don’t cause any issues with actually playing the game. The individual models all look good when fully zoomed in as well as when zoomed all the way out which is great for those who put their camera close to one of the two extremes. My only real issue with the game’s appearance was the UI, while it does look good I found that the bar seen at the bottom of the screen was a little too small for my liking, especially the small buttons and displays.\n\nGameplay\nSol 0 is all about building a colony, finding the necessary resources and then sustaining it. The first step is choosing which part of Mars (other locations are available and can be found on the Workshop uploaded by the developer) you want to establish your colony on. Each location has a different number of resources to be found and so the less resources there are, the harder the game is. The game contains eight maps (nine if you count the special tutorial location) and the developer has already uploaded quite a few maps to the Workshop including locations other than Mars such as Titan.\n\nOnce you’ve decided where you’ll build your colony, it’s time to send the first supply mission. While you can send astronauts straight away it’s best to send up a rover and some supplies on at least the first mission. The rover is what you use to find resources. You can set up an exploration route for it and when it detects resources they’ll appear as different colours and they’ll be shown as different heights depending on how much of the resource is available there (the higher up the bar is, the more there is to be collected). It’s best to survey the majority of the location before sending humans to Mars as resources are drained incredibly quickly and so you need to be harvesting them as quickly as possible in high quantities.\n\nAfter 120 Sols (Mars’ equivalent to a day) you’ll be able to send the next rocket to Mars. The basic rocket has a maximum mass of 7000kg and since the rocket itself is 6200kg you’re very limited in what you can take. Deciding what to take is possibly the most important part of the game, from a strategy standpoint, as you need to be able to survive on whatever you take up until the next mission. Later on in the game, once you’ve built certain things, you’ll be able to send larger rockets which can carry different equipment as well as colonists (the basic rocket can only carry astronauts).\n\nThe majority of the game is, of course, made up of actually building your colony. You’re given access to quite a few different structures, some of which are available right away, some of which depend on the presence of other structures and lastly some that require a minimum population before they become available. Structures are made to fit together in certain ways and the building is completely on-grid, i.e. there’s no flexibility when positioning your structures. Personally I prefer building like this as you end up with a much neater structure and you save on space but I realise not everyone likes it.\n\nBack to those resources you’re managing. The main four are food, water, methane and power. Food and water can both be brought to your colony on your rockets but there are dedicated structures for their production on Mars, their purpose is pretty obvious, to keep your humans alive. Methane is used in conjunction with water to refuel the parts of your rocket which land on Mars so that they can be launched and sent back to Earth. While it’s not hugely important to do this the landing craft does take up quite a bit of space so you will need to send them back every so often. Power is again pretty self-explanatory. While the harvesting of the other resources is fine I wasn’t too happy with how power was handled. Firstly, you can only use solar panels to generate power and they become completely useless during a dust storm meaning everything loses power and so you lose resources. My second issue with power in Sol 0 is that there’s no way to store it. If you could build power banks which stored excess power than my first issue would be balanced out but since there isn’t it feels, to me, like power has only been partially implemented into the game, i.e. you can’t really manage it.\n\nMiscellaneous The graphics options are incredibly basic and can only be changed through the default launcher that you see when launching the game.\nThe soundtrack and sound effects are good and fit well with the game.\nThe pricing of the game is great for what it offers.\nWhen you launch a new rocket it arrives on Mars instantly which, of course, isn't realistic.\nAs well as dust storms, you'll find yourself up against meteor showers which, while rare, will cause serious damage if any of the meteors hit your colony.\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nSol 0 is a great colony building simulation with enjoyable yet challenging gameplay and plenty of locations to keep you busy with. Sol 0 isn’t perfect but it is good fun and for such a small asking price you’d be silly to pass it up if you’re a fan of similar games or want to try something new!\n\nJust Reviews.\n\nEl K.","January 15","true","5.2"," 142 of 167 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","142","167","6","15"

Sure I could go for an overly flashy game where you hit the end of the tech-tree in a matter of an hour, or I could play this game that was an obvious labor of love from a single developer who isn't asking for every ounce of your money to experience a dream they had.\n\nThe trailer does the game all forms of justice. You hit Mars, your main goal is to eventually not need the Earth per-se for resources. Godspeed. That's it, the game's goal is that simple in definition, but actually getting to that point is a relaxing struggle as you try to explore and survive on the great dustball that is Mars.\n\nIs the game hard? Not at all! Is it fun? Of course it is! Is it worth my 5-6 dollars? YES IT IS!","January 15","true","4.6"," 68 of 81 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","68","81","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DudeThrottleToaster/recommended/387370/","DudeThrottleToaster","DudeThrottleToaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DudeThrottleToaster/","161 products in account","Good game so far. Definitely far from perfect, but it is still a work in progress. The developer is in constant communication with the player base, and you can tell his dedication to the end user. He is a one man designer, so I am willing to give him time and see where the game can go. Great potential for a great game, especially when the game is made by somebody so passionate about space travel and geology.\n\nIt can use a lot of refinement, true. But that is why you buy the game, play, and make suggestions in the discussions as to what you would like to see. Solzerogame will listen to your concerns and offer an appropriate solution. I spent almost an hour before purchasing this game doing my research, and have the utmost confidence in my purchase.\n\nThe developer even acknowledged that in a larger release, some bugs came out which did not surface during trials (this is a common occurrence) and will be working on all known issues in a timely fashion.\n\nI am all for supporting such projects. I hope to see more good things to come.\n\n\nEdit to make my review a little more focused on the gameplay itself, as I have been getting flak for putting my hope in the developer:\n\nAll of the above out of the way, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in game. It starts a little slow, but I believe this gives the player time to acclimate to the experience and learn how to start a base. It will require a couple trial and error restarts, but I love that in a game. I don't enjoy my experience being spoon fed to me from a silver platter. You will also need this time to thoroughly explore your planet and gain a firm footing on where to establish a base. Resources will be scattered and one must take time to make an informed decision in order to have a productive colony.\n\nThis game focuses on micro management. I like that you have so much control, but feel as if it could get tedious near the endgame. I am not sure how efficiently the micromanagement will scale up. We will see.\n\nThis game will not be for a lot of people, because it requires planning and thought. If you are a casual gamer, maybe find yourself another title. I on the other hand enjoy the challenge. I am big into games like Banished, PlanetBase, etc. So if you like those games, I believe this one will fit comfortably into your collection. Just understand that the game needs a little bit more time to mature. If you are not sure yet, throw it on your wish list and wait a couple months...\n\nBottom line: I enjoy this game. If it looks intriguing to you based on screen shots and videos, I am confident you will as well.","January 16","true","7.3"," 52 of 62 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","52","62","3","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mindlessme/recommended/387370/","mindlessme","MindlessMe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mindlessme/","419 products in account","Sol 0 isn’t the most groundbreaking strategy/simulation game at this time, but it does provide some enjoyable gameplay.\n\nAt this point I do like how the game restricts you on starting your base. You actually have to plan out everything before you decide to send some astronauts to their deaths. While starting out the game can be rather slow, I think it lends a lot to strategically launching what you need to survive. Once you get things rolling it’s just a matter of resupplying until you become completely self sufficient. This is where the meat of the game is, and can be satisfying, and boring to a point. Of course the game will keep things interesting by making EVERYTHING break every 10 seconds.\n\nThis leads me to my main issue with the game. I understand this is Mars, and it’s remote, and desolate, and things will happen. However, I hope and pray that human engineering is sophisticated enough to make technology that will last at least a few years without breaking. I would be cool with performing maintenance on things fairly often, but the amount of stuff that breaks in this game is TOO DAMN HIGH! If that’s not enough for you, on normal difficulty the game will make sure you become well acquainted with your new best friends. These friends go by the names, Dust Devil and Meteor Showers. They are like the best friend you really never wanted. They drop by way too often and wreck your best toys before leaving. These are the only “real” issues I have with the game.\n\nOverall the game is well worth what I spent on it. If a little more balancing is done with disasters and stuff breaking all the time, I think the game will be great. I’ve heard a lot of people complain about bugs, but I haven’t had any issues with bugs other than having to issue orders twice every once in a while.\n","January 16","true","13.8"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","38","44","6","0"

The design of the game mechanics themselves is unpolished to the point where the player must do a lot of things that are not fun and barely drive the gameplay forward.  Secondarily, the interface is such that many of these not-fun tasks require multiple clicks, often involving very small buttons.  I would recommend that the designers look up Fitts's Law of User Interface Design.\n\n- You must build next to existing structures, which makes planning really difficult sometimes.  How do you know if you'll have enough room for the structures you want to fit in an area?\n\n- Also due to the above, expanding the base is a chore because building even the smallest type of construction requires a large number of very careful clicks and keypresses to select, position, and rotate the object.  You now must wait for it to be fully constructed before ordering any construction adjacent to it.\n\n- Doors.  Whatever the design intent was, execution here is awful.  Just built 5 or 6 buildings?  Chances are, you now need to go and open 4 or 5 doors, which takes 2 clicks each.  Say I want to demolish a building (likely caused as a result of the first problem, nearly impossible to plan out space).  Well, the game gives you what you asked for - an astronaut walks over to the building and it vanishes instantly.  Did you move the screen to somewhere else because you didnt want to wait for the astronaut, and time is a resource in this game?  Did you forget to manually close the airlock that connects the building to the hallway?  Do you see where I am going with this one?  No, it is not the airlock scene from 'Interstellar', but it does result in half your base dying before you can scroll back over and click twice to close the airlock.  Like a psychotic individual trying to justify their actions, the game's attitude is basically "Hey, you never told me NOT to depressurize the entire base".\n\n\nI don't mind the "Early Grind" part of a strategic game where you spend more time and effort trying to meet the basic support needs before you eventually build something cool or discover something cool that opens new possibilities or allows you to use resources more effectively and then start -accomplishing- something cool.  This is actually what makes a lot of games interesting, a natural progression toward doing bigger and better things.  What killed this game for me and made it a Thumbs Down was the fact that the basics/needs/support mechanics force the player to revisit over and over again the worst-designed and least-fun parts of the game.\n\n------------------\n\n\nWith the main points taken care of, I will go on to mention some of the other issues of note that did NOT have a major effect on my decision to give this game thumbs down.\n\nLow production values and unity-style graphics - I love good graphics but I love good gameplay even more.  The price makes the production value issues acceptable IMO.\n\nSome scientific inaccuracies or abstractions for the sake of gameplay, like construction is instantaneous, the guys wearing the spacesuits never go indoors or you launch a rocket and it arrives on mars instantly (I dont care at all, just mentioning).  This is NOT a personnel or needs-based game like planetbase where people go indoors to eat and sleep.\n\nGenerally the game is rough around all kinds of edges.  I personally did not encounter bugs, but if you play a fair number of games, you will find the rough edges.\n\nIf a rocket launch is ready, the game continues until you click the button to go to a screen where you select a rocket and configure the payload.  What if you decide you'd rather wait until later to launch?  I could not find a way to back out of that screen, I had to launch something!  Not a dealbreaker but it illustrates the game's roughness.\n\n------------------\nIn closing as I said earlier, I wanted to like the game.  I hope the people who already bought it are enjoying it.  I hope the game is updated and improved so that more people want to buy and enjoy it.  I hope the developer goes on to make another cool game in the genre that I tend to like.\n","January 16","false","0.4"," 66 of 91 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","66","91","0","6"

They are left by the people who want candy. So you give them candy but no, they want it in their mouth. Ok so you put the candy in their mouth. But wait, now they need help chewing it.\n\nfor $6 bucks this game is amazing. If you enjoy playing this game for about 6 hours then it was worth it. $1/hr is pretty good value considering how much we waste on kit kats, vaps and breath mints.\n\nThe interface is so ♥♥♥♥ing simple, if  you took the whole 60 seconds to play the entire tutorial scenario. I mean the tutorial literally takes like a min todo.\n\nThe game mechanics are so easy to learn. But to pull off a successful colony requires quite a bit of thinking. Its pretty challenging for a simple game.\n\nAs far as realism goes it hits the nail on the head. It tries to keep it real in terms of technology thats feasable with in the next few decades but it does away with annoying aspects of real life like simulation. Its balanced so well.\n\n------------------------\n\nTo the Devs:-\n\n1) Please make the rover auto-explore for resources. Plus the rover should be a 2025 ish flying drone instead of a 2003 Mars Rover.\n2) The fuel collection and ore mining vs costs of fuel/items is highly imbalanced. The resource runs out way too damn fast. I mean we landed on a planet not an asteroid.\n3) Need a better solution to scrapping pods/buildings.\n4) Would like to pause the game and queue up construction of multiple buildings, so I have a way of seeing if they will fit properly and won't waste space.\n5) Need a windmill power generation option.\n6) Some of the buildings need clear descriptions for their dependencies.\n\nKeep up the good work.\n","January 27","true","8.2"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","31","39","7","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/387370/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I was easily fooled by this game. The startup at first was a little slow and even got me to a point where I was ready to turn away. Then, I just happened to figure out the game and started diverging into it. If you're a hardcore RTS person, this may not be for you. If you like a challenge and do enjoy space exploration/rockets/colony type games, this will definitely at the very minimum, interest you.\n\nSol 0: Mars Colonization is a real time strategy game in which you attempt to establish a base on Mars. Initially, you are able to choose where to land on the surface (or additionally, may choose to start with the tutorial). Before even landing on Mars, you need to plan your trip! This first rocket you get can't hold much, but it can get the necessities there. As you progress, you'll get bigger rockets that have a much larger capacity to carry goods/machinery (even a digger/miner). You may want to start off with their recommendation first or make some modifications. Two rovers is more than enough but one can be sufficient to get the job done (just a bit slower)! Rovers explore the surface and upon clicking exploring, will scan the area they come across. They will find methane, ore, clay and even ice. Rovers may be assigned routes so you don't have to manage them after every move. A methane extractor is a must until you get methane gas storage up and running. A methane extractor is meant to acquire a certain amount of gas before you can send your shuttle back to Earth. This is important as you can re-fill your rocket with cargo once this shuttle makes it back home. Shuttles also have the ability to land anywhere on the surface whereas other shuttles may need a landing pad. Beware though, methane extractors are only used one small shuttles and can be slowly fazed out as your mission progresses. Slowly but surely, you'll need an astronaut to start building the colony.\n\nHere's a problem : astronauts need 240kg of food and 120L of water/year in order to stay alive. Make sure you send the poor guy (or girl) with some supplies so they do not start dying off. Food is stored on your shuttle until you start building facilities that produce or store food. Cargo is essentially used to build anything in the colony. It weighs a lot more than food or water does but is a real commodity. You need space to store this cargo somewhere. The solution? Build palettes! The more palettes you have, the more cargo you can store on the surface of Mars. Once you do this, you're about ready to go to build a colony. Hopefully, you'll launch a forklift machine to make your life a lot easier. These machines can be assigned to move cargo from place to place automatically. Or if you'd like, you can maximize your building time by having an astronaut carry one of their cargo to start the initial build, then have the forklift trail the astronaut so they do not have to walk all the way back to the pallet.\n\nI should mention you'll need a lot of power supply and maybe an extra astronaut to help maintain the colony. The solar panels do get dirty and need regular maintenance. To get started, you can build a hallway or a four way hallway. You'll need a good mix of both to get everything you need in place. A regular hallway will allow oxygen machines to connect directly to them. This does not work with four way hallways. Upon placing a hallway (2 or 4 way), you may place a building of your choice. Some buildings include (and not limited to) habitats, green houses, refineries (that do not have to be connected) and refrigerators. Some of these buildings can be upgraded as well as the 4-way hallways. It's a bit frustrating at first planning how your colony will look but it'll come. It may take you a few trials and errors to figure out how everything properly fits. Just remember that the further you build, the more oxygen you'll need pumping through the hallways. One of the biggest features is being able to launch multiple shuttles at one time. You may launch 2 smaller shuttles at first but as you launch them back, you're able to launch more gear for your colony. This adds a dynamic to the game where this is always a bit of hope.\n\nGraphics are at best decent and remind me of UFO afterlight (maybe slightly better). The animations themselves aren't too bad but don't seem complete. When the miner mines, there aren't chips of rocks that come out and building is really quick/minimalist (more of a symbol that it's being built than anything else). Sounds are okay. They do a decent job but aren't too varied. Notifications may keep coming your way and may drive you nuts (these can be turned off).\n\nOverall, not a bad game. If you're really into space exploration and like the colony building RTS sort, I would highly recommend a purchase on sale. If you're looking for RTS with a little martian action, it ain't here. They introduced a "speed-up" or "slow-down" feature in game which is really useful when there isn't much going on. I find that even though different levels are offered, there is a bit of repi here.\n\nRATING : 6.8/10\n\n\nGameplay	C+	Story / Campaign	C+	Visuals / User Interface	C+	Sounds / Music	C	Replay-ability	C	Overall 	C+\n\nScreenShots :\nAssigning a route to a rover\n\nThey've allowed players to see where the minerals have been discovered\n\nSmall shuttle launch screen\n\nLoading up the big rocket with options available\n\nLaunching the big rocket back to Earth","February 23","true","5.6"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","3"

This one is pretty fun, like a light version of a few other games of its type. The question though is, "would you recommend it to others?" and my answer is, yes. Having said that, it must be pointed out that there are a few annoying bugs such as your astronauts getting stuck on solar panels when they are supposed to be cleaning them or how just plainly stupid and unintuitive the bulldozer is... I mean, I fling a rock clear across the screen sometimes for no reason I can understand. It is nice to be able to automate or not with your forklifts, but what about the astronauts? It would be nice to be able to take them off of automation (other than selcting them) because they often do not prioritize well and spin circles in place... frustrating.\n\nPast all of that, this game is fairly simple once you get past the learning curve of having little to nothing explained to you at all.

It turned into the Mars we know today.\n\n\nEverything but the kitchen sink\n\nThis is why when we send people to Mars (It'll happen one day) they're going to need to take everything they need with them, at least until they can set up some basic infrastructure, and that's where Sol 0: Mars Colonization starts, with the preparation for the first permanent manned presence on Mars.\n\nWhen you first fire up the game you'll be treated to a screen showing a rocket sitting on a launch pad waiting to be loaded with supplies.\nThis will be your first flight to Mars and the first decision you'll need to make in the game, what supplies should you start out with?\n\nThe launch window to Mars only opens up every few months (it's an orbital alignment thing) and the weight that your first rocket can carry is limited.\n\nYou'll likely be tempted to send an astronaut up to have a look around, but for your first flight this would be a very bad idea, whilst you could send a man up along with all the food and water the rocket can carry, this almost certainly wouldn't be enough to keep him alive until your next launch window, also without any building supplies, his usefulness would be pretty limited up there... it'd be a meaningless death.\n\n\nCuriosity\n\nFortunately you can satiate your curiosity by sending up a rover or two, these little robotic friends can explore the surface around your landing area, scout out any mineral and ice deposits and allow you to make a more educated decision about where your next Lander should touchdown.\nYou should have a little room left on your rocket to load up some supplies to leave on Mars in preparation for your future flights too.\n\n\nOpportunity for Exploration\n\nAfter picking your landing zone and deploying your rover you can set about exploring the surface.  You'll need resources to help sustain a manned mission.\nInitially, everything you need is going to have to be shipped in from Earth so the sooner you start producing your own resources on Mars, the sooner you can think about sending actual colonists up there to found your first settlement, but we're getting ahead of ourselves...\n\n\nPathfinder\n\nYour rover should find several resource deposits on the surface ranging from Ice (for drinking water) through to methane (for rocket fuel).\nIf the thought of constantly clicking around the map to send your rover searching for resources doesn't appeal, don't worry, you can draw out paths for your little robot to follow whilst you get on with other things.\n\nWhen your next launch window rolls around, it's back to Earth to load up another rocket.\nYou'll send more supplies, food and water, maybe even an astronaut if you're feeling brave and ready for things to get really interesting.\n\n\nThat's the Spirit\n\nOnce you've taken your first small step for man, your astronaut will want to get busy with some construction work,  all those supplies you've already dropped are now going to be used to lay the foundations of your Mars colony.\nYou're going to need to place some pallets to start unloading those supplies, maybe you should send a forklift up to help with that on your next launch?\nYou'll also want to build a cryotank early on to start thawing out that ice to use as drinking water.\nMost of what you build will need power too, in the early game this is going to come from solar panels so you'll need to pick a quiet spot for those as well.\n\n\nRed Planet\n\nYour first hour or so in the game will be spent building up the basic infrastructure on Mars, greenhouses for food, solar panels for electricity, oxygen generators for... well you get the idea.\n\nSeveral launches later (assuming your astronaut didn't come to a grizzly end on the Martian wastelands) you should have a rudimentary, self sustaining colony on Mars, equipped with all the luxuries like breathable air, drinkable water, home-grown food and maybe even a bed to sleep on.\nKeep in mind that things don't always run smoothly...

Some rooms just never get enough oxygen, even though I've built a lot of generators right next to them and opened the doors. Perhaps this is why regardless of food generator rooms, the food level is negative.\n\nThe bulldozer is ridiculous: it has no AI, so you need to push away all the rocks, one by one, and it often gets stuck in terrain.

For instance, you start off with a lot of rocks preventing construction. You could push those rocks into a chasm, but once you build a geology lab, you need to destroy them there to build research points!  Nifty gameplay idea.\n\nIf you're looking for a pretty simple simulator with lots of theme, then this has my recommendation.

For 5 dollars its a steal and the price hasnt changed much (if at all) since then either. For what this game has (in steam release) I would say it could be a complete game without any additional content and you could easily rack up HOURS of gameplay if you play through all the maps not to mention the map generator and map maker plus any additional workshop content. I remember playing with only 3 maps I believe without any ingame goals. I also like the fact that there is a lot of figuring out that you have to do such as effeicient base building and extractor placement for down the road especially with plant dna splicing as you have to experiment to see what works best, Ive only played the first map but I would imagine what each strand of dna contributes to crop yield varies based on climate. (could be wrong here)\n\nThe only thing that sticks out to me is that due to my color deficiency the yellow and green (clay and methane) blend together on the map and I have a hard time telling the difference some times. For those of you who dont have this problem its not a big deal but im sure if there was some way to change the colors or adapt an option for those of us who are color blind or who have color issues it would help substancially since resource searching is heavily dependant on matching up those colors!\n\nAll in all a great game and I cant wait to see what the future brings with this game.","January 17","true","5.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

These are still been worked on and should be improved over the next few patches.\n\nThere's a decent amount of maps to work on although some are quite limited in space - no pun intended..\nYou can put in a lot of time in building the perfect colony to hold several hundred people.\n\nIt can take a little time to get used to all the game mechanics, it's quite possible you'll fail a few times before you get the grip of everything and a lot of planning is needed at the start to ensure that you leave room for the larger buildings but you may find yourself having to rearrange your colony as you expand.\n\nNoticeable features that stand out from other colony games are the research and the connection you have with Earth.\nEvery so often you can supply your colony with food, water, people –workers and colonists- and building material. This allows you to be able to keep your colony being built and stocked with required resources until it can support itself or after it suffers from a disaster.\nThere’s two kinds of research, one for improving efficiency of collecting resources and the strength of your structures. Another for improving the food output on your farms.\n\nThere's challenges to complete for all the maps, unlocking new structures which will help out future colonies and even gaining access to a new map.\nDust devils and meteor strikes will frequently occur which you will need to deal with, the larger the colony is the more likely you are to be hit by them.\n\nThe main objective is to prove that you can survive by declaring independence from Earth, ending all supplies brought from them.\n\n\nI still personally consider Sol 0 to be in an early access due to the amount of issues that still need fixing and that more content is needed to be added but the game is expected to be in a continuous development and will receive more over time.\nI would suggest waiting a little longer if you wish to avoid the "early access feel" but for those willing to put up with it and can see past that then the game is definitely worth getting if you enjoy city builders / colonisation games.\n\nA demo is avilable so check that out if you're interested in Sol 0.

The verdict? Buy this game. It's a bargain. I'm a huge fan of resource management sims (such as SimCity, Banished, etc...) and it's a tremendous value for the money. Since I'm also a space nut, I also love the theme! It works great on my 4K monitors as well.\n\nA game like this is incredibly difficult to get "Right", so to speak, in everyone's eyes, but it has a lot of the basics spot-on, IMHO. Resources like water and power just happen - you don't have to wire anything up, which would be tedious, nor do you have to provide pipes for water, etc... I've even emailed the developers with some suggestions, and their responses were friendly, factual, and appreciated the feedback. It's clear that they're continuing to work on and improve the game. Can't ask for a better team!\n\nThere are a few things I'd love to see in the game:\n\n1) Bigger maps! This is a common complaint on all sorts of resource management sims, but I do find that some of the terrain offered by default is a bit limiting. This can be alleviated by creating your own map with nothing on it. One of the developers said that it wouldn't be easy to make larger, unfortunately, so with that in mind, I have some other ideas:\n2) Go vertical or underground with buildings!\n3) Sometimes the forklifts and astronauts get stuck where they can't access certain regions to repair or add. Maybe have some tunnels that can go vertical briefly to make small bridges so that forklifts and astronauts can pass underneath them?\n4) A way to convert astronauts into colonists and vice versa. After your colony is built up, the use for astronauts goes down, and you have a lot of idle resources sitting there not doing anything and it might be nice to have them "reused" as base personnel\n5) More building types - Maybe educational centers, recreational areas, machine manufacturing areas (for making things like rovers, forklifts, etc...)\n6) Trade with other active maps. I like being able to share resources in games like SimCity, and it seems like this could be useful when food/water/methane, etc...become anemic\n7) A way to shut down units' use of electricity. I have had overbudget situations before on power and there's no way to get things to use less power, and I wound up having a lot of my food spoil and colonists die because I couldn't get a thermal generator built fast enough and it took at least a dozen ships from earth until I finally got enough to build a generator.\n\nThanks guys! Keep up the great work! I am honored to be playing along side future developments!","February 16","true","26.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unlike that dinosaur of a game, resources are not really the limitation in this colonial game.  Seemingly arbitrary demands for increased population, and micromanaging of resource locating is not enjoyable to me.  The mechanics, and what I experienced of the gameplay is, while interesting, not enough to want to keep this in my collection.  Base building and population count seem to become formulaic.  Find x amount of water deposits, find y amount of methane deposits, then keep your population at adequate levels.\n\nWhile completely different genres, the approach to resource location and exploitation in Offworld Trading Company shows a far more appealing approach to these gameplay elements.  Alternatively, the Mars Simulation Project also offers a far more robust approach to the maintenance, resource, and time pressure Sol 0 tries to incorporate.\n\nI really want to like this game, but unfortunately, the mechanics applied to the game make it far more tedious than engaging.","May 4","false","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Expect to be frustrated by a few things that don't necessarily make sense on your first play through -- one example is I discovered when I went to build my launchpad (a huge building) that it needed a hallway directly in the middle of one side, adding on to my base to accomidate that used all my supplies, then when my food hit zero two astronauts died (because having a supply sufficient to feed the astronaut is not sufficient, your food also needs to be above 0).\n\nOverall, great concept and fun game.","January 16","true","2.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IAMRichardT/recommended/387370/","IAMRichardT","👽 IAMRichardT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IAMRichardT/","232 products in account","Sol 0 has been a good game thus far and I've enjoyed what I've seen for the most part. Having played a lot of RTS games, I can say that this one is a bit unique in regards to what it targets. The graphics are pretty good, and it seems to play smooth. There are a lot of different options when it comes to buildings, and you have to really plan ahead in order to be successful, as any good RTS should be.\n\nWith that said, and the fact that I do recommend the game, I've ran across some issues which I hope will be addressed down the road. The only reason I state these issues, yet still recommend the game is because it has a lot of aspects that are fun, and fixing the bugs will make the game so much better.\n\nAI Paths\nI find that the units will get stuck in an area or will "loop" when told to do something. They will pick up supplies and then walk three steps, turn around and come back. I sometimes have to click on them, cancel what I need them to do, and then re-issue the order. The pathing does work about 85% of the time, it just needs to have some special attention in order to iron out the bugs. I've also noticed that sometimes I can place an oygen generator, and for whatever reason at random points, the astronaut will lay down the first supply to build it, and after that, the building will be ignored by them and forklifts and will never be completed. So in return, I'll have a building half-built, just sitting there. I'll then have to destory things around it, in order for me to destroy that building which is stuck.\n\nUI\nSometimes I've noticed the UI is a bit glitchy. You have to make sure that you click directly in the middle of a building in order to select it, otherwise it will select the ground. And no I don't mean that I'm clicking on the ground away from the unit, I mean that I can click somewhere off from the center of the unit and it will do that.\n\nWithin the main menu, you have to "right-click" on the first button so that you can access the workshop custom maps. Their needs to be another button for this, or an option. Had I not just started randomly clicking in order to see where the option was at, I would have never found it.\n\nBulldozer\nThe vehicle bugs out quite a bit when it comes to moving rocks. And the rocks themselves will glitch out and actually get stuck in a building and then making it sort of difficult to get them away so you can continue to move them.\n\nOver-all, yes the game has issues, but that still shouldn't detour you from trying it out. It's not bad for the price, and as I said before, hopefully in the next few releases the issues will be addressed. I'd probably end up giving this a 7/10.","January 23","true","5.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

All in all, the game is less polished than many free browser-based flash games. It's disappointing, but there are many better games to scratch the itch that this game is going for. Banished, PlanetBase, and BigPharma all have similar elements, but they're simply much better games.\n\nIn short, Sol 0 just isn't much fun. It's boring, unacceptably so in the first hour of any colony, and then still boring mid to late game.

It's lacking depth and features. The majority of the reviews both positive and negative, including mine, have put little to no time into the game which directly indicates how little content this game has especially for a buidling/ management game (I did play about 4-5 hours of the non steam version before the game was released). After two hours of play you have seen the entire game, no new mechanics or features will be introduced.  If this game was released in early access, i would still say it is lacking in features but if there was a promise to implement more i might consider recommending this.  As it is, this game is released as a full release and i can in no way shape or form recommend you buying this game considering its barely a game with so little content.  hopefully the dev implements much more into this game.","January 16","false","5.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I really like it. Some of the other user comments made me a bit wary about buying it. However, I was not disappointed in the least. The graphics are good and my integrated graphics card handles everything just fine.\n\nThe learning curve is initially steep and perhaps this is why some of the other comments are critical. A lot of astronauts died my first couple of tries. If you stick with it though, things come together. Currently I have a Mars base with 101 colonists with only six of them as astronauts, I am into my 26th year on the planet in game time. Terraforming is underway. I am just about self sufficient and may decide to claim independence soon. Replay-ability seems to be very high.\n\nI find the user interface first class, easy to use and smooth with no glitches or crashes to report.

Astronauts and forklifts consistently get lost and/or simply wander off to do absolutely nothing, and that's if they aren't stuck in the middle of a wide open flat area, seemingly unable to move in any direction. That problem appears to be a random bug that affects astronauts, forklifts, and rovers. I even created a blank map to test it after I had two forklifts get stuck (with full loads of crates, of course) and become unsable in a previous game. Still no joy, as I had astronauts ignoring solar panels, a rover that would get stuck in the middle of a wide open area, and forklifts full of supply crates that ignored construction or repairs, whether I had them automated or tried to guide them manually.\n\nIn my experience, the game (at this point) all but requires you to babysit every single unit enough to make them usable on a regular basis.\n\nI really, really, really like the idea of the game and would love to play it some more, but given the horrid unit behavior, the game feels like it's a long way from being a proper release. Stay away until the game is fixed. I'll be shelving this one for at least a few months, and I definitely don't recommend it in its current state.","January 19","false","17.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It barely feels like a finished product and somethign you would expect in a early access.

And damage roll weather that I swear will just flip a coin to see if it hits the same swath of unpathable wilderness every time or any building in a precision strike, does not feel very random. No damage model for most buildings other than resource neglect breakdowns, its either in one piece or it exploded.\nBut there is a lot of good in the game. It looks pretty good. The resource exploration, random weather with related challanges (solar flares, dust storms) not the bs twisters and meteors. Food and water managment to people. Building managment to conserve space. random terrain generated maps. Most resources are finite (can be good or bad) And a cheep price.\nYou'll wish for more to do after about 20 hours because you beat the -5- challanges that unlocked some extra buildings and rocket for subsequent playthroughs.

I enjoyed that three hours (and found it a wortwhile way to spend 6 dollars).  You cost to time ratio might be different.\n\nThe game feels a bit like an early access. I did not notice anything in the way of bugs, but there just is not a whole lot of content.\n\nUltimately the game needs more stuff. There is not a whole lot of challenge to designing your base. You don't really have any consideration about where things need to be placed. A game like this needs more logistical management which this has very little of. Having to deal with more conflicting aspects of the management could make this game way more interesting with many many more hours of play.\n\nIt is kinda sad, because there are a lot of interesting features and the fundamental foundation for an amazing game that I could spend dozens of hours playing.\n\nSome of the really intersting features.\n\nYou splice and interbread different microbes with different traits to bring life to mars. I really like the microbe genetic-splicing aspect. I think a lot more could be done with it. Like, this could be really good. What about gene mods for your colonists?\n\nYou design missions from Earth. The whole shipments of stuff from Earth is really good. However, again, much more could be done with it. You should need to schedule shipments before they arrive. It should have a chance of mission failure. You should have a cost resource that you also need to stay under (rather than just weight). This resource should also be affected by how well your colony is doing (science produced, approval, or something).\n\nUltimately there are better games of this ilk. However, its pretty cheap, and it does a few new things that I felt were worthwile.\n","January 24","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have loved this game from the beginning and will do so forever. This game... its just awesome! You build a colony on mars, ya ya sounds easy enough. Hostile atmosphere, no water, dusty blah blah blah. But you dont know where all of your resources are, so you have to send rovers to map out the surface resources. You need people to run everything (my biggest problem) and if you dont stuff explodes! Then, when you have the perfect balance of power, food, water, and people, a meteor shower hits. It misses most of the buildings but hits one or your solar panels, you dont have enough power to keep you food from spoiling and your out of food and 3 people die of starvation, then you dont have enough people to run your nucelar powerplant (yes, on mars) and BOOM, everyone dies. Im not complaining, this game is fun and addicting! All of the strategey involved: you can upgrade your base's armor to prevent the previous from happening, and you can build weather arrays to predict where the next weather storm will hit, and what do you send on your rockets?

There are parts of the game mechanics that feel a little clunky until you play an hour through them, with particular attention to unit pathfinding. The pathfinding on many units can be frustrating and requires micro-management, but with experience you will learn the unit tendencies and to toggle off a unit's ability when you want pathfinding to improve. After sinking in a good amount of game time you'll learn to appreciate the lack of excellent pathfinding as it's an attention draining game mechanic that actually improves gameplay.\n\nAside from pathfinding issues, the game is fun, plays on weaker systems, and can be rewardingly challenging. I've been really enjoying this game and it fills a great niche for the price point, It's worth the money and some future attention to the developer on any further titles.

My biggest issue is the AI. I don't know how many colonists I have lost because my astronauts and forklifts suddenly take leave of their senses and forgetting to build a greenhouse that would save the colony. Sound is woefully terrible and clearly taken from stock sounds with little effort taken in regards to choice. Dying colonists sound like breaking machinery, cryotanks sound like a battalion of infantry are marching around inside and the soundtrack has a section that will, on first hearing it, make you panic and wonder what's happening until you realise it's just part of the ambient track.\n\nOn the whole it's not a terrible game. The mechanics work nicely and the slow progression from unmanned exploration mission to a thriving colony is realistic; albeit as far as your imagination might believe a real life Mars colonisation would be. The requirement to send nearly everything up by rockets that have a waiting period between each launch is a nice touch because it makes you plan ahead and think. This is no gratuitous colony builder.\n\nThe challenge of space management and the learning curve kept me interested until the AI astronauts started to become complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Were this issue fixed I would recommend this game wholeheartedly. As of now, I recommend it but only with an 8/10.

There are parts of the game mechanics that feel a little clunky until you play an hour through them, with particular attention to unit pathfinding. The pathfinding on many units can be frustrating and requires micro-management, but with experience you will learn the unit tendencies and to toggle off a unit's ability when you want pathfinding to improve. After sinking in a good amount of game time you'll learn to appreciate the lack of excellent pathfinding as it's an attention draining game mechanic that actually improves gameplay.\n\nAside from pathfinding issues, the game is fun, plays on weaker systems, and can be rewardingly challenging. I've been really enjoying this game and it fills a great niche for the price point, It's worth the money and some future attention to the developer on any further titles.

It has so many things going for it; independent dev, great theme, fun concept...\n\nBut.\n\n1: Slow the game down. A year takes about 10 minutes and in that time you can only click so much. This game is built as a strategic building and colony management game, but the pace and speed makes it feel more like one of those "real time strategy" games with no strategy and lots of clicking where the only goal is to make as much resource as fast as possible for war - or in this game's case, not dying. This game needs to decide what it wants to be - strategic building or RTS.\n\n2: A bit of mystery on how things work and what they do is great. But a complete lack of instructions (have fun with the Biology Lab!) is really annoying and destroys any actually planning you might find time to do. I would assume any society smart enough to ship a biology lab all the way to Mars might actually know how to use it. So should the player.\n\n3: Wonky AI and unit automation. On some units this works OK, on others it is laughable. And there is zero consistency on how routing and automation works from one unit to the next. Come on - this is just lazy development and usability. It needs to be standardized and fixed.\n\n4: COLONY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH COLONISTS!\nCOLONY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH COLONISTS!\nCOLONY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH COLONISTS!\nCOLONY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH COLONISTS!\nCOLONY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH COLONISTS!\nCOLONY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH COLONISTS!\nCOLONY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH COLONISTS!\n\nTired of that? Here is one more - COLONY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH COLONISTS!\n\nIf you like hearing this every thirty seconds, then you will LOVE this game. Especially if you want no information about what level of colonists would be ideal for your designed base and to have the never ending colonist alert messages hide the really important alerts you need to know about. Again, if this is meant to be a strategic game, give the player useful information and alerts that help them play, I don't know, strategically!\n\n5: The bulldozer. Enough said.\n\nThere is more, and yes, there are also many GOOD things. Like I said, I really wanted to like this game. But overall it suffers from a lack of identity and completion. I hope in the future it gets fixed. Would love to come back and be able to support this and give it a positive review.\n\nAnd of course, to play the game I had hoped I bought.\n","January 20","false","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When travelling back to Earth, any tasks or directions given to Astronauts or machines are forgotten by those that are given tasks. Along the same vein, if given a task before leaving for Earth, if an Astronaut is currently building something, the task is half completed and cannot be finished nor can it be destroyed thus becoming a nuisance (ex: a half finished solar panel that cannot be finished nor destroyed is a waste of supplies  and energy and becomes a problem when upgrading to geothermal tech power as it cannot be destroyed to make way for more geo-therm plants). Astronauts get hung up when automated, and only fix one solar panel before they become stationary and more or less useless until tasked again as well, when left to their own devices. When selecting a weather satellite for the first time, if the player is unfamiliar with the rocket's capability, the rocket can only be used for weather satellite transport, despite being capable of also carrying a small amount of supplies (those supplies never reach the martian surface). I would also like to see a larger map in future as the current selections are small, but provide adequate space for colonizing (a nice option would be for the developer to take a look at the game "Banished" on Steam and expand map and resources based loosely along that game's design). All in all as I previously stated this game has potential and despite the bugs is innovative in a sandbox format for those who dream of martian colonization some day (which I think is the point of any game along these lines...for the gamer to be immersed in a fantasy of the possibilities.)","January 21","true","57.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did not notice anything in the way of bugs, but there just is not a whole lot of content.\n\nUltimately the game needs more stuff. There is not a whole lot of challenge to designing your base. You don't really have any consideration about where things need to be placed. A game like this needs more logistical management which this has very little of. Having to deal with more conflicting aspects of the management could make this game way more interesting with many many more hours of play.\n\nIt is kinda sad, because there are a lot of interesting features and the fundamental foundation for an amazing game that I could spend dozens of hours playing.\n\nSome of the really intersting features.\n\nYou splice and interbread different microbes with different traits to bring life to mars.

What about gene mods for your colonists?\n\nYou design missions from Earth. The whole shipments of stuff from Earth is really good. However, again, much more could be done with it. You should need to schedule shipments before they arrive. It should have a chance of mission failure. You should have a cost resource that you also need to stay under (rather than just weight).

This problem is the ai for the forklifts, they're nearly impossible to control with more than 2 pallets and are only good set to automatic. All in all  this game is brilliant and I definitley recomend it!","January 20","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The interface is intuitive and straightforward, and the principle of the game, particularly the idea of using near-future technology, makes it a winner for anyone with even a passing interest in space exploration.\n\nThere are several maps and a custom map creation feature, which adds to the longevity of gameplay. I've really enjoyed the game thus far and will be keeping an eye out for future projects from the developer.","April 6","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is great to see a developer with such devotion.\nNow on to the game, the gameplay is really amazing(Besides a few bugs.) I was running graphics at lowest and it still looked decent. There is a lot of content and replayability into this game.\nFor the price you can not beat this!\n8/10\nUPDATE: A new update was released for this game and it included some pathfinding improvements and a few nice features to make the menus more navigateable. The updates are coming out quick. This is what I like to see in a game.\n8.1/10\nUPDATE: A new update was released finally after a month and it was very small. Did not address any bugs and only made a few changes to the menus. At the rate of development, it will be a year or two before this game is finally fun and addicting to play.\n6.5/10\nUPDATE: Been another month and no update, it is unfinished and no updates have come out for it. Looks like the dev has abandoned the game. I would not recommend this game now.\n4/10\nNote: I will keep updated my review as I play more and as each update is released.","January 16","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
