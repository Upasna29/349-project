"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laptop65/recommended/10180/","Laptop65","Laptop65","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laptop65/","192 products in account","Whether you prefer Single Player, CO-OP or Multiplayer, this game has all three of them. I have reviewed all three parts of the game if you are considering buying this.\n\nCAMPAIGN REVIEW (Single Player):\n\nThe campaign is about 6 hours long roughly. It can be shorter or longer depending on your selected difficulty. The story itself is very good and is set 5 years on from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It is not a Hollywood Blockbuster but at the same time it is not some random quickly written story that was put together in a few hours. Every mission has different objectives and you can feel the climax building up to the finale of the game. Every level is action filled and there is never a dull moment in the campaign. As you progress you will play in different locations in the world such as: Afghanistan, Brazil, Russia, the Atlantic Ocean and the United States. Even after completing the story there are Intel collectables to find and of course Steam achievements. There are also quite a few Easter Eggs in the campaign levels. The story for this then continues on into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\n\nSPEC OPS REVIEW (Single Player / CO-OP):\n\nThe Special Op missions are mostly the campaign levels but switched the other way round and with different objectives in the level. There are a total of 23 spec ops missions in MW2. 21/23 of these can be done on your own or with a friend. There are 2 Spec Ops missions that can only be done with a 2nd player. The missions get harder and harder as they go on. Some of the levels in this have been re-used from COD4. There is no matchmaking for the Spec Ops so the only way to find another player is to invite / join a friend and begin playing. There are also quite a few Steam achivements for this like with the Campaign.\n\nMULTIPLAYER REVIEW (Multiplayer):\n\nThe Multiplayer is what is considered the strongest part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Unlike COD4 this time the game uses Steam Cloud, so your rank will all be stored online and will sync every time you close MW2. The highest level you can reach is level 70 with the addition of 10 prestige levels. When you reach Rank 4 you will have the ability to create your own classes where you can choose your main weapon, secondary weapon, perks and equipment. You can also stick attachments to pretty much all of your weapons on here. You can also unlock weapon camos for your main firearms, which some look very cool when placed on. You have the ability to join friends in a session and vice versa (provided there is space) and host your own private matches for this.\n\n\nConclusion: I highly recommend buying this game if you are reading this out of personal interest or if the game has gone up for sale. I recommend playing the Campaign before going to Multiplayer to get a feel of the game, but it is of course entirely your decision.\n\nThings to be aware of -\n\nThere is no direct controller support for this game.\n\nIf you are considering the DLCs, it should be noted that there are less players than that of 2009 - 2010, so the only two main playlists are the base game and those who own both of the DLCs. If you only buy 1 DLC, you will find literally 0 games on there.\n\nMW2 Multiplayer has no dedicated servers. It uses a matchmaking system that will pair you up with other players in the same playlist and game mode as you.\n\nThis game uses VAC. So if you are banned for cheating / modding the game, your ban will be permanent. There is no way to lift a ban. You have been warned.\n\nAt the time of posting the Multiplayer peak for this is around 10,000 players which is more than enough to find a game and play. Campaign / Spec Ops population doesn't go above 5,000.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns with the game feel free to leave a comment.\n\nSingle Player / Spec Ops Hub - http://steamcommunity.com/app/10180\nMultiplayer Hub - http://steamcommunity.com/app/10190\n\nThank you for reading and enjoy the game if you decide to purchase!","November 25, 2013","true","175.0"," 465 of 527 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","465","527","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smurphy-/recommended/10180/","Smurphy-","Smurphy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smurphy-/","61 products in account","This game helped me through severe depression after my wife left me. I was a mess, binging on coke and strippers to try and forget the pain she brought to me. Next thing I knew I was shooting Heroin in a Vietnamese rice farmer's hut. Don't ask me how I got there and why I decided to stay for 7 months amongst his family of 12, but I thought this was the end of my miserable life. As I lay naked in a pile of my own and what was mostly the vietnamese family's vomit and excrement... there I saw it. The light glistening on the screen. It seemed MW2 had swept the world by its feet and even in the remote jungles of Vietnam it managed to find itself. It was clear to me, this was a sign. God himself intended for me to see it. The little vietnamese child obviously didn't know what he was doing, as the little noob camped in the corner with his ACR with dual attachments of a heat sensor and a silencer, I marvelled at the beauty of this game. At once I got up, and I ran. Did I know which way to run? No. But I didn't let that stop me. Sooner or later I was back in the humble streets of my hometown. I picked up MW2 for PS3 at tescos and went on to play the game for 4 days straight without food or water. My mother and father were a little worries considering they presumed me dead and I hadn't bathed since I was back. But if there's anything I learned it's that In those 4 days I was born again, although I soiled myself several times and passed out once, I knew what it meant in life to experience pure joy and happiness. As a married man with 2 beautiful children now I really hope MW2 is brought on to next gen consoles; it will bring the utmost joy to me, and my children will be able to relive the pure ecstacy I felt. Of course they're not old enough to play yet and not even nearly mentally developed to even comprehend what would be going on as they are still babies. But the bright and vivid images of their father getting that 30th kill streak with his ump-45 silencer will fill their small hearts with pride. As they watch their father roar in triumph as the screen goes white and the battle ceases. There I will stand proud a man. A man with a 5.2 K/D ratio. A true champion. A figure to look up to. A figure to learn from. And you better believe that once they are of legal age I'll teach them and guide them to achieve the successes I have. But alas as my imagination delves deep into a utopian world it hits me that in fact this is not the case. Instead I lay here in bed next to my Russian mail-ordered wife. where only these fantasies numb the cruel pain of life. Although I am happy to have a wife and children, my profession as MW2 montage specialist has failed to provide for me in recent years; in fact my primary source of income is the allowance my mother gives me weekly. I forgot to mention that my job situation has resulted in me living at my parent's home... But I digress. Thus I cannot even begin to explain the importance of bringing MW2 to next gen consoles. It has become a joke that not a single person will pay for a copy of my ps3 MW2 360 no-scope montages. The dedication and time I put into these videos cannot be overstated. I hope that this petition succeeds. For the sake of my wife Vladimir, and my children Terminal and Highrise I pray this comes true. Nothing will bring me more joy. Nothing.","March 24, 2015","true","48.8"," 467 of 559 people (84%) found this review helpful 640 people found this review funny","84","467","559","640","22"

Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.\n\nNow, you may be asking, "Why is the multiplayer dead?" The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hackers and children. Hackers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hacker, another five are going to take that persons place.\n\nThe game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warefare 1, World at War, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review.  Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and "clean" of hackers and cheaters.\n\nSome examples of hackers in Modern Warfare 2, are people who use:\n\nWallhackers\nAimbots\nInstant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL Unlocks\nHud-Hacking (Yes, it does exist)\nInstant VAC Ban\n\nThe Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in MW2 that are safe.\n\nPlease, please, please watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.\n\nI've heard that Search and Destroy games are safe, but the player count is very little in most game types.\n\nIf you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small. I wish all of you people luck.\n\nOverall, get it for the Spec-Ops, and the Singleplayer.\n\nEdit: I no longer play MW2. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hacked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.\n\nStay safe, and play safe...and watch for hackers...\n\n-Cheers","July 15, 2014","false","9.7"," 422 of 534 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","422","534","2","42"

Sometimes it gets so intense, it tends to challenge your emotional stability. Especially the part where...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/10180/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 picks up after the events of its predecessor and awes you from beginning to end. The original Modern Warfare brought a whole new look to the series and was quickly one of my favorite of the series after just a short while of playing it. Infinity Ward returns to call all players to active duty across several systems including the PC.\n\nModern Warfare 2 story kicks off after the events of the first title. Players are given a brief recap of the previous story and then sent through the obligatory boot camp tutorial. For those of you who haven't played the first game, I suggest picking that one up too, although knowledge of the first story isn't critical - just more rewarding. There are several major upgrades this time around though most of the cool ones are found in the multiplayer. As far as the single player experience is concerned, I did find the very beginning a little helter skelter. There wasn't much story to go on at first and I found myself a bit lost. This is really my only real issue about the single player campaign of Modern Warfare 2.\n\nAs I mentioned above when PC gaming is concerned I am always favoring keyboard and mouse setups over a controller. This is mainly because of the use of mouse offers a superior aiming system. The controls are pretty solid and responsive and for those that use mice with side buttons I found it easier to pull off melee knife kills and grenade tosses by assigning both to those buttons if applicable.\n\nModern Warfare 2 boasts a lot of gameplay options this time around. The three main modes that players can engage in are the single player campaign, multiplayer and the all-new Spec Ops mode. The main story while it doesn't really bring anything new to the table is fun and took me around 8 hours to beat. For those seeking a bit more of a challenge, Veteran difficulty will take a bit longer, as you'll most likely be dying a lot more due to some incredibly brutal enemy AI.\n\nThe AI, both ally and enemy is better than before offering a much more realistic experience. The chatter heard when you're pinned down or flanking is more involved than ever before. If your squad says there are tangos behind a car or dumpster, they really are there. If you pay attention to what they are saying then you're less likely to be completely blindsided and it makes the levels go a lot faster.\n\nBefore you even start the game you are given the option to skip the "really disturbing parts". While I didn't skip these parts, which I'm sure you've read about or seen on the internet by now, I found that had I skipped them I would have missed out on an experience that I will never forget. Without giving anything away its one of those scenarios that leaves you in deep thought about the world around us.\n\nSpec Ops allows for some engaging co-op fun. While it's not a co-op campaign like in World at War I found them to be quite fun. There are five levels of challenges ranging from Alpha to Echo, each with their own missions for a total of 23 scenarios lifted from deleted scenes and material from this and past Call of Duty games. You are graded and rewarded with anywhere from one to three stars based upon completion times or the difficulty level you're playing on. You can do these challenges yourself but it best if you do it with a friend. Players can team up with another player via the Internet to tackle these together to gain the maximum amount of stars. One of my favorite challenges is where you must aid a second player as they travel on foot through enemy territories from an attack chopper.\n\nThe real improvements to Modern Warfare 2 are found with in the expanded multiplayer. One of the biggest features is the newly expanded kill streaks roster. Once you reach level 10 these bad boys kick in and the fun begins. You gain access to bigger and better kill streaks as you go like a Harrier strike or the mother of all kill streaks, the tactical nuke. Fear not, the kill count doesn't stack from match to match.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 also features a much-improved Perk system from the original Modern Warfare. One of the things I will mention is the Pro Perks. These are gained by completing the challenge for say Sleight of Hand for instance. If you accomplish that challenge requirement you will be able to bring up the sights faster when you unlock Sleight of Hand Pro, which can be a lifesaver. There are a ton of perks to unlock and many challenges to complete, more than one review can cover, so discover away. The traditional rank up system in place in the first Modern Warfare is still there complete with unlocks such as weapons, attachments and camo. Players can still choose to enter Prestige Mode and start all over again if they want to at level 70.\n\nOne of the only downsides and one of the biggest gripes amongst the PC community is the lack of dedicated servers and the 32 person matches got nixed. Infinity Ward's decision to make the experience the same across all of the major versions is not really a bad choice honestly. Sure it may make a lot of people upset but you still get a kick ♥♥♥ experience either way. Players are now limited to up to 18 players during certain matches, which is more than enough for the map designs provided.\n\nModern Warfare returns with that same level of excellence the previous games had and surpasses it to a whole new level. The amount of detail that I saw on my 1920x1080 monitor with max settings was absolutely mind blowing. The sheer amount of individual animations on the clothing and gear mixed with the superb real-time physics makes this one of the best looking PC titles of 2009.\n\nOne of my favorite effects is the new blood splatter used when you take damage. To think that just two years before this game we were still used to seeing the usual red damage tint on the screens that got progressively worse. Now we have blood splatter that actually hinders vision and adds a more realistic feel to the world. The lighting effects used when in night vision mode when you're in Washington D.C., as well as little details like light refraction on a damaged riot shield are all just simply amazing. I was also impressed with the rain and blowing snow effects seen in various chapters of the story.\n\nModern Warfare 2 features some amazing sound effects, both with the environments and the weaponry. I've never heard any of the weapons used in this game in real life but they sound damn good. Infinity ward has done a fantastic job at capturing each of them for our listening pleasure. You literally can tell the difference between a M4A1 and an AK-47 as they are being fired at and around you. But as I mentioned above I absolutely love the battle chatter. Not only does it help you meet your objectives but it also immerses you in the whole experience. I also have to give a big nod to Hans Zimmer for creating a fantastic score for Modern Warfare 2. He truly is a musical genius.\n\nWhen you look at the total package, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is hands-down one of the best first-person shooters of its time, and a truly amazing offering across any system.","October 20, 2015","true","274.3"," 164 of 193 people (85%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","85","164","193","18","1"

Considering they're still charging £20 for the game, I'd say that's disgusting...\n\nIt's a great shame, because it has a great single-player, great co-op, and the multiplayer IS good, but people have ruined it. All I can really do at this point is go to their Steam profiles and report a violation. Some people will rage in the text chat "why must you hack? it's ruining the game" or similar, and 99% of the time the response is "hahaha cry more" or "shut up u ♥♥♥♥♥♥", as you'd expect. It's be GLORIOUS if these toxic people were VAC banned, but I doubt any of the higher-ups will do anything about it.\n\nNot so much angry, as I am sad.\n\nEdit: Steam displays my hours played in single player. I currently have 69 hours in multiplayer at time of edit.\n\nEdit 2: The 'unhelpful' votes for this review are from fanboys who are infatuated with grenade launchers, trickshots, and probably some hackers themselves.\n\nWhich reminds me... the playerbase in MW2 is outrageously toxic. The number of times I've been called a f#ggot, had cancer wished upon, been told to kill myself, insulted for using a certain weapon or equipment... seriously, someone wished for my mother to die of explosive diarrhoea because I was using an MP5K.

I was fascinated with how fun and "realistic" it was. I was immediately hooked on the games. I played Cod 2 and 3 religiously, and I will never ever forget the day I heard about Modern Warfare. Finally. FINALLY a game of 21st century setting. I was ecstatic. I played through the campaign and had endless hours of multiplayer logged on my Xbox 360. After doing everything I thought possible in that game, my dream came true, and another was released. To some, there's almost no difference between CoD4MW, and MW2. To others, like myself, there's an indescribable gap between the two games, where MW2 is on a whole new and higher level. To me, no other shooter game has had the balance MW2 had. It has set a standard for me that I look to in other FPS games, often times I find no equal, save the original Black Ops game. This balance is what made the game for me. I've never been a person to be "naturally" good at video games. MW2 was one where I excelled. Because I had a fighting chance. I found my niche and I stuck with it. I maxed the game on my Xbox 360, and eventually grew into PC gaming, leaving consoles behind. I only have a few minutes played on this game so far, but I had to actually back out and type this up even after the first few matches. It has been such a trip for me going through the menus and the lobby system. If you're considering buying this game for nostalgia, do it. Do it and don't take any flak that comes to you. Do it, and relive your early teens of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ girlfriends, mountain dew, and yelling at your parents. If you've never played MW2 and are looking to see the hype, I'm afraid it's gone forever. There's a few people around on the servers, but the HYPE, the actual maxed pace heartbeat of a game that took the world by storm is gone forever and ever. Then again, maybe that's the beautiful thing. Maybe that's what has this game frozen in time as one of the all time greatest.\n\nForever and ever, Modern Warfare 2.\n\nNuovaVita","April 14","true","0.7"," 79 of 88 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","79","88","7","3"

On so many other titles, you get completely f-cked by other players due to the difference in skill.\n\nThis game is different. Instead of getting f-cked by other people, the game f-cks you instead. Half the time it doesn't work properly, and it's completely unbalanced with a degenerate community. Quite often you'll encounter a hacker, and it's not rare to get stuck in a modded server. There's no Server Blacklist included, so you can enjoy getting thrown back into the same sh-thole over and over again. Enjoy the modded server admins who DDOS you if you use a weapon that they don't like.\n\nAll in all, it's the classic Call of Duty experience. This game is a known carcinogen and I thoroughly recommend it for ages 8 to slept-with-ur-mom for hours of aggravated fun.\n\nEDIT (9th Jan, 2015)\nThe limited concentration that this game requires at the casual level, as well as its fast-paced low-strategy gameplay, results in the player becoming accustomed to passively playing with the potential for high success. Because of this, it will be somewhat difficult to start playing other games again, as you are used to no-tactics gameplay.","November 1, 2014","true","5.5"," 140 of 179 people (78%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","78","140","179","58","4"

I found the Single Player storyline interesting and awesome (great fights, and great scenes in general) and I have to admit that I wanted MORE of it when I finally finished it. Although there were many negative reviews and comments about it, and to be more specific, about the mission "No Russian" in which you are asked if you really want to play it or skip it, I think that Modern Warfare 2 is a worty replacer of its predecessor Modern Warfare, which was a huge success for Infinity Ward.

I feel that it is a nice sequel to Modern Warfare 1 with a fantastic storyline and the addition of Spec Ops, a series of short challenge levels. There are a variety of guns to choose from and different levels to play through. For the most part, none of them feel repetitive in any way. It looks great and plays great.\n\nOn the other hand, multiplayer is a let-down. Its been a few years since release and many people have gone on to other titles in the series leaving Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer dwindling. They have the servers and the players but failed to incorporate some sort of anti-cheat. Multiplayer is filled with hackers. Not every game has them, but they are there (and you can definitely tell when its enabled). For whatever reason, they also got rid of the server browser so there are no more modded servers.\n\nThe single-player and co-op experience is great. Multiplayer can be so-so.

There's no word from Steam when the community asks for soloutions.\n\nThere are groups of legit players who play private matches, if you can find one, it's fun, but that's more of a tactic to avoid hackers for people who already have the game.\n\nSome of the things hackers can do is change your resoloution, your minimap size (to the point where it takes up the whole screen.) These problems can be fixed by deleting you config files and verifying your cache.\nThey can also corrupt your rank, and this can't be fixed, unless you get into another hacked lobby and they rank you up to 70.\n\nThis is a GOOD multiplayer game, but I'm going to thumb it down because of how prevelent hackers are, and people should know about.

After being in it for few seconds it disconnected me from it with a message saying "Bad host". So I was like ok but then I noticed that literally all of the stats were unlocked (Titles, Emblems, Weapons and their attachemnts, etc.), it also boosted me from being a lvl 30 or something noob to a lvl 70, allowing me to enter prestige mode. I didn't deal with that, just a bit worried.

I didn't know at the time how to deal with it so I went with the flow, hoping nothing will happen to my account. Then after a few weaks I recieved a ban, saying "Cheat detected". I then tried to contact any support but people on the forum stated it's too late because Steam Support won't listen to people who got VAC banned. ALSO NOTE: I remembered that around the initial VAC ban my account was hijacked and couldn't retrieve it after a year when a Steam Support finally realized the issue. I assume that the hijacker went downloading the possible external software for the game and used it on it in order to get me banned. I remember that guy, go check him up, his name is "solutioNNN" and also has a VAC ban from MW2. I am not lying about this, no I am not making this up, this is my honest review.\n-------------------\nSingleplayer: Wonderful!\nSpecial Ops: Wonderful, even co-op is great!\nMultiplayer: THE WORST, EVERY TIME YOU GO TO LOBBY, YOU COULD ENTER A HACKED ONE, RESULTING IN UNLOCKING EVERY WEAPON, WEAPON ATTACHMENT, EMBLEM, TITLE, ETC. THIS WILL RESULT IN A UNFAIR VAC BAN.\nI do not recommend this game simply because of this mess. I recommend you to pirate this game just to experience the wonderful storyline.\nOh, and if you happen to buy it and find that your items are all unlocked, I suggest you contacting the Steam Support before  getting a possible permanent ban.","April 25, 2015","false","144.0"," 280 of 449 people (62%) found this review helpful 69 people found this review funny","62","280","449","69","20"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anderskolling/recommended/10180/","anderskolling","Bilbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anderskolling/","87 products in account","This game helped me through severe depression after my wife left me. I was a mess, binging on coke and strippers to try and forget the pain she brought to me. Next thing I knew I was shooting Heroin in a Vietnamese rice farmer's hut. Don't ask me how I got there and why I decided to stay for 7 months amongst his family of 12, but I thought this was the end of my miserable life. As I lay naked in a pile of my own and what was mostly the vietnamese family's vomit and excrement... there I saw it. The light glistening on the screen. It seemed MW2 had swept the world by its feet and even in the remote jungles of Vietnam it managed to find itself. It was clear to me, this was a sign. God himself intended for me to see it. The little vietnamese child obviously didn't know what he was doing, as the little noob camped in the corner with his ACR with dual attachments of a heat sensor and a silencer, I marvelled at the beauty of this game. At once I got up, and I ran. Did I know which way to run? No. But I didn't let that stop me. Sooner or later I was back in the humble streets of my hometown. I picked up MW2 for PS3 at tescos and went on to play the game for 4 days straight without food or water. My mother and father were a little worries considering they presumed me dead and I hadn't bathed since I was back. But if there's anything I learned it's that In those 4 days I was born again, although I soiled myself several times and passed out once, I knew what it meant in life to experience pure joy and happiness. As a married man with 2 beautiful children now I really hope MW2 is brought on to next gen consoles; it will bring the utmost joy to me, and my children will be able to relive the pure ecstacy I felt. Of course they're not old enough to play yet and not even nearly mentally developed to even comprehend what would be going on as they are still babies. But the bright and vivid images of their father getting that 30th kill streak with his ump-45 silencer will fill their small hearts with pride. As they watch their father roar in triumph as the screen goes white and the battle ceases. There I will stand proud a man. A man with a 5.2 K/D ratio. A true champion. A figure to look up to. A figure to learn from. And you better believe that once they are of legal age I'll teach them and guide them to achieve the successes I have. But alas as my imagination delves deep into a utopian world it hits me that in fact this is not the case. Instead I lay here in bed next to my Russian mail-ordered wife. where only these fantasies numb the cruel pain of life. Although I am happy to have a wife and children, my profession as MW2 montage specialist has failed to provide for me in recent years; in fact my primary source of income is the allowance my mother gives me weekly. I forgot to mention that my job situation has resulted in me living at my parent's home... But I digress. Thus I cannot even begin to explain the importance of bringing MW2 to next gen consoles. It has become a joke that not a single person will pay for a copy of my ps3 MW2 360 no-scope montages. The dedication and time I put into these videos cannot be overstated. I hope that this petition succeeds. For the sake of my wife Vladimir, and my children Terminal and Highrise I pray this comes true. Nothing will bring me more joy. Nothing.","April 9","true","4.5"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","85","34","40","44","1"

With that being said, our score comes with a disclaimer. For those planning to check out everything Modern Warefare 2 has to offer – online competition, full co-op Spec Ops mode, as well as the campaign – you’re looking at a no-brainer purchase. For the strictly single player crowd, however, Modern Warfare 2 is surprisingly short, and doesn’t live up to the standard set by previous Call of Duty games. The campaign can be completed in as little as six and a half hours, and the missions make better scenarios and moment-to-moment adrenaline rushes than they do a cohesive, well-told story. If you’re going solo, you’ve officially been warned. Look at the complete Modern Warfare 2 experience though, and there’s no denying its rightful place at the top.","December 9, 2014","true","22.6"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","25","31","3","0"

The campaign's plot is so dubious yet somewhat predictable, that you will now be able to stop playing it before you've completed it.\nThe special ops mode is for you and your friend to spend time with. You'll have different missions to complete, with various vehicles and weapon choices. With the vast amount of experience I have with FPS games the game was easier, yet completing the game on Veteran still remains a bit of a challenge. This difficulty level is something new, even when the AI remains dull and predicable, you'll need practice and fast reactions to survive.

And im talking about both experiences: singleplayer and multiplayer.Now, 2016, i re-bough this game on the steam winter sale. And god, what a good choice this was.\nAbout the multiplayer: its the strong point of MW2. The community may be smaller now, since there have been so many new CoD games, but there are still people playing. You can find a party even 4 am on a wednesday. The multiplayer quality is fantastic. The amount of content keeps you coming back for more. A lot of customization options, which includes call signs, emblens, perks, attachments... Killstreaks are a good reward for the players skills.

Here you do some very cool missions, usually not very long. They use some locations from the campaing. But its very good becouse its VERY challenging. Its very skill based, and it will take you some time and patience to do all Spec Ops missions. Its much more fun to do with a friend rather than doing alone. Spec Ops gives MW2 a very unique perspective over the other CoD games, becouse in my opinion its a better mode than Survival and Zombies.\nAnd theres the singleplayer campaing, which continues the story from MW in a very good way. The story is short, you can probably beat in in 5-6 hours in the regular difficulty, but its a very entertaing story about war. Although you probably wont spend a lot of time in this mode, you will enjoy the cinematics and the whole story a lot.\nIs MW2 the best CoD game so far? Yes. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the bests.\nBut wait, isnt the game too old? Yes and no. "Yes" becouse it was launched 7 years ago, but "no" becouse the game aged really well in all aspects.

Very common is also modded lobbies (may happen that modder will take your levels, attachments and weapons you already got before), texture hackers (undetectable), aimboters, wallhackers, norecoil hackers, rapid fire scripts or god mod. I personally prefer very popular mod Search and Destroy, where you average find around 6 games (5 of them are ususally trickshot virgin kids which literally dont let you play because of constant stunning, tubing or instant kick and let alive only the biggest idiot of your team as victim to do trickshot on him). Useful thing is tool called MW2sa by dint of you can kick hackers or tubers. The author of this tool asks in readme to try behave like adults and warning other people before kick them for some reason, unfortunately, his wish is not always heard, so often happens that 12yo kid kick you because you just winning with him or he maybe dont like something you said before.

However, while the moderate wing is trying to preserve the stability and the relationships with other countries, a special team, with John McTavish at its head, is trying to retrieve an important piece of technology in Russia. But when an old foe is provoking a Russian-American war, it's up to McTavish and his team to prove that a terrorist from Russia is behind this attack, though there is also a traitor in their ranks. Besides, during the war, a Private is fighting in Pennsylvania and in Washington to repel the Russian Army, trying to avenge the death of those killed by the old foe - though they're not aware of that.\n\nYou take the role of a mole, Joseph Allen, that will be one of the factors in the war though he didn't know that he was used for that purpose, of Roach, a member of McTavish's team, during the quest of finding any tie to the terrorist Vladimir Makarov, of a soldier, whose name is Ramirez if my memory serves well, that fights for USA's liberty after the wrongful invasion of Russia and of Soap, the hero from the previous game who will reveal himself as a familiar face for the player.\n\nAnyway, you need to play MW to understand why there is a war between Makarov and an American General, though the confirmation happens in the sequel. Anyway, between these points of view, you have the American soldier that isn't even aware of the plot, the mole that would like to explain the events but can't because well... he can't, the team searching for proofs that will wash USA's name from the affirmation that they're behind the attack. None are from the Russian's side, though the moderate wing doesn't know about Makarov's doing and that they were really reluctant to declare the war, and that seeing the story through Makarov's mind would be a long descent into a mad mind.\n\nThe gameplay is still the same as COD: you shoot, you take cover, you avoid dying, you have no respite because of the enemies or the type of enemies that are harder to kill with these armors, you direct missiles to the ground, you have timed passages, you drive vehicles.... everything of that without having time to sight as the gameplay is still nervous as hell.\n\nHowever, apart the campaign, you have also missions to do in co-op (or alone), with different difficulties, like for the solo mode. And you have also a multiplayer mode, though I have to admit that I didn't play it, as I'm not interested in it.\n\nThe graphics are also quite good, for that, I must say that I'm never deceived by that series. Even the little part in space is quite interesting. Anyway, fighting for the White House is a nice experience, and it's by night!\n\nBut what I prefer in Call of Duty, it's the soundtrack.

PS3, PC, wherever you can imagine. It was and still is the best game i've ever played (in terms of how much i enjoyed it)\n\nStory(No Spoilers)\nThe story starts 5 years after the events of Modern Warfare. Imran Zakhaev has become a martyr, and his right hand man, Vladimir Makarov provokes war between Russia and the US. It's up to "soap' McTavish and the Task Force 141 to stop him.\n\nGame Time\nApproximately 8 hours.\n\nIn detail\nIt's too late to experience multiplayer, since only a handful of people are still playing but the single player and coop missions are still playable and enjoyable\n\nPros\n+co-op missions. Best feature in my point of view.\n+Interesting plot, great cinematic cutscenes\n+During single player, you control either a Task force member or a US army ranger, depending on the mission, giving you the opportunity of experiencing war from the first line, but also the conditions of undercover black ops.\n+Great multiplayer. Everything is well designed, creating an enjoyable experience.\n+Great soundtrack, greatly implemented into the campaign.\n\nCons\nSorry, cant find any :P\nConcluding, i totally reccomend it since it's likely to attract players for multi on a sale. As i said before, it's the most enjoyable game i've ever played.\n\n10.0 / 10.0\nMerged 700 hours of gameplay (2 accounts)\n\n\n1. Dont touch it even if it's on the house [0-3 / 10].\n2. If you are bored of every other game [3-5 / 10].\n3. Grab it whenever it's on sale (or pay the full price if you are wealthy enough) [6-8]\n4.

I was in a game with one of those cheaters, decided to make everything fast without my consent. I asked him "I want to play in a vanilla standing" and he listened to me. Made everything normal. He was the best host I encountered too. The cheater chose only fun maps and didn't mess with our games after I requested him not to. The fact that cheaters can easily exploit due to the fact they practicly own the server when hosting makes it very vulnerable for cheaters, not to mention bad connection. I mention good cheaters that do not impact your experience negativly but those cheaters whom beat the game with their cheats is annoying, sometimes their cheats are shown in the killcam which is funny yet rediculous. I don't really like this game, p[layed it to remember the thrills of my 5th grade life. I remember having a friend over and we would be on split-screen Rust just quick-scoping for like 2hrs.

The main campaign has it's good moments hunting down hostiles in the favelas or trying to save DC under heavy attack, but is quite short as usual (or even more). Using the riot shield is a nice change of strategy and a lot of fun and the game delivers the adrenaline rush that's expected, but despite SPEC OPS (which is mostly the same levels from the campaign with a few mods - packing an occasional surprise for specific COOP missions) and MP, there isn't enough to grow attached to this title, you basically just want to play the sequel that delivers the full blown chaos that continues the story...Perhaps that was the point?","August 7, 2014","true","29.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Everybody was hyped for it, myself included.\nAnd unlike what you might expect, all my skyhigh expectations was suddenly very real. The gameplay was smooth (for a freshly launched game, mind you), the levels were well made, and the action was fast paced.\n\nNow, even after several hundred hours spent in the multiplayer, and many new titles being released since, I still find myself returning to this game from time to time. the amount of players still playing, is ever dwindling, as can be expected with an aging game.\n\nbut the feeling this game gives you, of nostalgia, of pure fun and carnage, is unlike any other game out there (save for DOOM 3, and UT 2004). It really is, an all time classic.\n\nIf you have yet to play this game, but like fast paced shoot-em-in-the-face-and-laugh type of FPS games, then this is for you. If you on the other hand like FPS games that require more though than duck, run, and shoot, this game (hell, this whole series of games) might not fall to your liking.\n\nHowever, given that its drop in price of the years, althought still not cheap by any means, it's defo worth a try. If nothing else, to take on your mates, and have a blast that you will all be able to remember.\n\nI hope this provided you with some usefull insight into this game.\n\nAll The best\n\nPvt.

But Infinity Ward and Valve really need too watch over this game . There is way too much hackers. Like once this guy was in a lobby rank 2 and all of a sudden hes rank 70. The story line is amazing . You in a snowy terrain then all of a sudden you chasing a guy in A Favela of Rio de Janerio. This is full with action just like the old Call of Duty 4 (Shoutout) . The one thing that they need to fix is it is really hard to join friends , pretty much impossible.

When i played back in 2010-2011 on my PS3, i didnt realize how good it actually was. And im talking about both experiences: singleplayer and multiplayer.Now, 2016, i re-bough this game on the steam winter sale. And god, what a good choice this was.\nAbout the multiplayer: its the strong point of MW2. The community may be smaller now, since there have been so many new CoD games, but there are still people playing. You can find a party even 4 am on a wednesday. The multiplayer quality is fantastic. The amount of content keeps you coming back for more. A lot of customization options, which includes call signs, emblens, perks, attachments... Killstreaks are a good reward for the players skills. I personally like the matchmaking system instead of dedicated servers, becouse it keeps the game alive, becouse everyone can become a host, we all know there are a lot of limitations to host a dedicated server.\nThere is also a mode that can be played both singleplayer and multiplayer, called Special Ops. Here you do some very cool missions, usually not very long. They use some locations from the campaing. But its very good becouse its VERY challenging. Its very skill based, and it will take you some time and patience to do all Spec Ops missions. Its much more fun to do with a friend rather than doing alone. Spec Ops gives MW2 a very unique perspective over the other CoD games, becouse in my opinion its a better mode than Survival and Zombies.\nAnd theres the singleplayer campaing, which continues the story from MW in a very good way. The story is short, you can probably beat in in 5-6 hours in the regular difficulty, but its a very entertaing story about war. Although you probably wont spend a lot of time in this mode, you will enjoy the cinematics and the whole story a lot.\nIs MW2 the best CoD game so far? Yes. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the bests.\nBut wait, isnt the game too old? Yes and no. "Yes" becouse it was launched 7 years ago, but "no" becouse the game aged really well in all aspects. Im talking mostly about graphics and gameplay.","March 11","true","24.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I have had no problems with the installation of the game, and have given a lot of time into this game in the past (When I was playing console) The game itself still looks beautiful for today's standards even though it was released back in the fall of 2009. I have already sunk a lot of my time into the multiplayer, and I am looking forward to re-playing the campaign.\n\nGame BalanceThe game is very easy to run, even if it needs lower graphical settings, The maps are large and have a lot of hot spots for gun fights, speaking of the guns... They are all balanced (Other than the Vector) The mechanics have a lot of detail, and have had no glitching problems so far.\n\nProblems encounteredAlthough I do have a problem with the amount of hackers, due to the VAC system not working to its full potential. Now I know it is classic for COD to have extremely sensitive feet (You can 1 hit someone if you hit their feet) but I have seen a lot of people 'Drop Shotting', if you are unfamiliar with this it is when you see a player you drop to the floor instantly and shoot, this makes the person stutter and they end up dying, but this can easily be bypassed by shooting their feet ;)\n\nMultiplayer ExperienceI have enjoyed re-completing the multiplayer stuff, and will continue to do so. Nothing else has really bothered me, and in actual fact the player base on here is much more squeaker free, and has more mature players.\n\nOverviewI would recommend this to any person who has played Modern Warfare in the past, and would like to re-visit the nostalgic times, even if you have never played Modern Warfare 2 I would still heavily say it is the best COD around. It has even guns, a nice amount of players, and overall I still great graphics engine.\n\nExtra InformationDeveloper(s): Infinity Ward, Aspyr (Mac)\nPublisher(s): Activision, Aspyr (Mac)\nPlatform(s): PS3, Xbox 360, PC, and Mac\nRelease Date: November 12th 2009\nGenre(s): Action, FPS, and Multiplayer\n\nSource(s):\nPersonal Knowledge\nSteam Store Page\n\nWritten for 11th Floor 11th Floor Group","February 11","true","2.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2! Lets begin!\n\nThis is my Favourite Call of Duty game in the franchise! i think this one has everything that you want!\nThe story is the BEST call of duty story in the franchise ( or maybe Call of Duty 4 i couldnt decide that ) it has many good suprises , EPIC battles and more!\nThere are multiple ways to do some missions! like there are stealth missions in the game , you can stealth with your AI ( btw the A.I is really good in stealth parts ) or just go and Rambo everyone ( wich often results in dead )\nBut still , the suprises in the game are really goodly made! they come when you least expect it!\nBut lets forget the story , the game also has a "Spec Ops" called gamemode , where you can do differrent objectives on different maps , and you earn Stars for this. You can Collect 69 ( 69 ) Stars if you do every of these spec ops on Veteran Difficulty. Sounds pretty hard , but the really good thing that every of these spec ops missions ( some are must ) can be done in coop! so just slap your buddy and tell him to come play with you! I dont know where to review the Multiplayer , but i think i wont gonna include it in this one! Lets see the results :\n\nPros :\n-The Best call of duty! ( with call of duty 4 )\n-really good Story!\n-Awesome Graphics\n-Runs on my PC :D\n-Spec Ops is really good to play!\n-Good , unexpected Suprises in the story\n\nBad Things :\n- The Singleplayer wasnt really hard! I could easily beat the game on Veteran difficulty\n- Spec Ops is really goddam hard sometimes , there are no checkpoints in this gamemode so it will gonna make you rage\n- Some characters in the story , like my favourite Roach , doesnt has voice nor face\n\n8/10 Would "Make a Jump for it" again","August 23, 2015","true","69.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","3"

Please note that everyone has their own opinion so I am just stating what I feel.\n\nFirstly the single player story line which links into Modern Warfare 3 is very engaging, at times emotional and even intense. I have enjoyed completing the single player twice and am considering re-playing it very soon. (on the Playstation3 though). Overall if you include the time spent on this game on both the PC and PS3 it will be around 300+ hours which i feel is a well spent amount of time for a game. At this current time sadly with the release of new games this game has become more innactive, especially on the PC and servers are becomming more "cheat based and hacked"; however from my experience in the past this game has been very enjoyable with it being fun to raise up your rank as well as customise your weapons of choice. With a variety of different game modes and and killstreaks this game really is one to put on the shelf as a modern classic. As I said this review is based entirely upon my own opinion so you all are entitled to your own opinion which may differ from mine. But definately a great game. At this time though it is best getting on the XBox360 or PS3 rather than the PC which has become more innactive due to other game releases over the last 2 years.","December 17, 2013","true","14.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

And arguably the last amazing Call of Duty game made by Infinity Ward. And to some, the last amazing Call of Duty game.\n\nIts campaign is similar to the first Modern Warfare, being rich in storytelling with really - but yeah, really - emotional moments. I think it's even better in that department, as it made me feel pure hate towards the leader enemy boss after a certain event I'd rather not mention here. It's definitely one of the few games that are so well made they emotionally pulled me in - like, not that I'd start punching pixels on my screen or anything like that, but I suppose you understand what I mean.\n\nBut it is the multiplayer part of Modern Warfare 2 that made it one of my most played games. No matter how many times I ragequitted from a match, saying how I'd never ever launch this stupid game again, it still kept me entertained for more than 200 hours. Let's be honest - it's an unbalanced mess which isn't really fair most of the time, as who wouldn't be mad if they got killed by someone with a grenade launcher or a random airstrike passing by on a 24 killstreak... But it's Modern Warfare 2, and it's always been awesome. The maps, the weapons, the community calling you names when you're playing better than them, the damn feeling when you get a kill and see that iconic yellow font, the, well, everything.\n\nModern Warfare 2 is a legend in the video game industry.","October 4, 2015","true","9.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

They completely ruined the awesome server system they had in the first MW and replaced it with this IWNet bs that doesn't let you choose the server you wanna join. Because of that it has become a paradise for cheaters, hackers and all sorts of rubbish. Combine that with the gameplay that has been more optimized for campers and snipers than ever before. Some of the perks and killstreaks you can acheive with camping are so overpowered that it ruins the whole experience. The single-players is just as good as the other COD games, but I bought it mostly for the multiplayer, so I would say it was a complete waste of money.","June 9, 2014","false","7.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The core gameplay is mainly the same, but you'll fight in new settings, with a larger arsenal than ever before. There is also Special Ops mode, which is a very nice addition.\n\nAlthough the Campaign is very good, my only real complaint is the mission placement. I really didn't like how it constantly switched between the British and U.S. missions. It gave me whiplash. I also found the Multiplayer to be dull, but I don't buy CoD for the Multiplayer anyways.\n\nOverall, the game is worth every cent.\n\n9/10","June 20, 2014","true","27.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Maybe. See the section on the Multiplayer for the big warning about this game.\n\nThis is a great single player game, because it's such a well-rounded experience in general. The gameplay feels sharp and responsive, and incorporates and improves on Call of Duty 4's mechanics. The levels in the story, and the spec-ops bonus missions, are well planned, well-designed, and varied, taking the player all over the globe from South America to the White House, all over Russia and to the Middle East. The plot is far beyond what you would expect from a mil-shooter today, willing to subvert the jingoistic American Police State that these games often build up. It's not Shakespeare, and at times falls to pleasent stupidity, but again, it generally rises above the rest.\n\nThe multiplayer.\n\nIf you want to buy this game for the multiplayer, DO NOT. This game is quite old now, and several new generations of COD have come and gone. The game also features console-style P2P gaming, so the lack of players has hit the possible pings hard. Half the game modes will be empty, and the other half will be playing against people across the globe. There are mods out there to reinvigorate the multiplayer with servers instead of P2P (rightfully so, as it is insanely adictive otherwise). Look into these options before you buy this game, because to get anything out of MP, you'll need to download one of them.","December 15, 2013","true","37.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It really feel's relistic in every way possible, and yes, regenorating health is possible in real life, Thank you game theroy for telling me that. The story for most games are to focused on one thing and really stick with it. This game's story is all mixed up and with giant plot twists no one would expect. The modern warfare franchise has always amazed me in every way possible, but this one was different, it was just... mind blowing.

Once was in It's prime, now it is not. As age has shown and newer tittles have been released, this community is quite lacking, expecially for us folks in Australia. Not to mention one of the funnest arcade like sniping systems around still, such a silly and out of place game with many over powered things such as the "commando perk" being able to lounge many metres for a knife kill or even the "noob tube". Just a great funny game, in which many hours can be lost. :)\n\nNever the less, a great game and always has BEEN! a great pickup for most gamers out there and not many pounts I can jump on that haven't already been sprouted too!\n\nFinal verdict - 10/10 Paano's Stamp of Approval","February 5","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I have played pretty much every Call of Duty that's ever existed, from the first one to Black Ops 3, and none of them have ever even come near the enjoyment I've had with this game. My dad was actually the one who got this game in the first place. He played it for the campaign (which was short but very epic and fun), but never really ever touched multiplayer as he knew he wouldn't be very good at it (he also didn't like tubers, campers, and knifers). I played the campaign and multiplayer a lot after he got mostly done with it until our family computer crashed and broke down while I was playing it. I didn't touch the game for a few years until about a month ago; and holy ♥♥♥♥ did I reveal a holy grail. I'm now completely addicted to this game. I don't know what it is that makes this game so damn fun, but whatever it is, the developers sure did it right. This game exceeds above and beyond what other shooters can't do, and I would DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone who wants a old game that's still insanely fun.\n\nAlso, since this game is relatively old, there has been trouble finding games. As far as I've seen, people either play TDM, FFA, or Domination.","March 19","true","77.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

If you play Tdm you will still find games. This is the point where CoD multiplayer was at its best in my opinion. I understand that people really enjoy CoD4, but this game is easily just CoD4+More - more attachments, more weapons, more killstreaks, deathstreaks, more reasons to prestige, titles and emblems, more ways to play and be unique in your play. Campaign is one of the best in the series, but much better if you play the Modern Warfare series in order because they all connect and have the same characters. SpecOps missions are fun side things to do co-op with and have decent replayability with the varying difficulty and needing to do better at them to unlock more missions.\n\nOverall, great game with a great campaign and the point in the series where multiplayer was at its best. I have yet to run into any hackers in my first ten online games.\n\nPart Two:\nRight after writing the review I had a run of like, five games with hackers in them. So, there are a lot of hackers in the game, but if you just avoid where they are looking or are playing on a big map there's nothing to really worry about. Remember, true skill always is better than manufactured skill. You can still destroy them even if they see you through the corner.","May 14","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I have been a loyal fan of Call of Duty for a very long time even pre my PC days. I have racked up over 700 hours on COD Ghosts and nearly 200 hours on Black Ops 2. At the weekend I randonly recieved a notification mid game during my gameplay in Ghosts to say that I had been permanently banned from online multiplayer. No reason! Just a notice. I have never cheated on a game in my life, I collect games, I achievement hunt and I have a f*cking expensive PC, all of which pretty much cements me being a solid and dedicated gamer. I contacted Activiton and went on the community hum on Steam and all I am told is it's irreversable and they say I have breached one of their t&c's for fair play. What the actual f*ck?? Why would I rack up nearly 1000 hours to then decide to cheat?! Are they F*cking stupid? I think this is absolutely disgusting and I am totally enraged by this because they have given me no explanation whatsoever other than a link to their policy agreement which is total BS. I am so enraged I am now refusing to buy anything from these c*nts ever again. How can someone or a company have the right to do this to a customer, especially when I am a loyal customer and have done nothing wrong at all. I gaurantee it's a group of ♥♥♥♥♥ on here that have complained about me in some way to force a ban on me. I have no VAC ban or nothing and never have had one.

I recently re-installed this game about two months ago to play with some buddies of mine because they were playing. I literally played less than 3 mintues and then uninstalled. Simply because, #1. It was boring. and #2. HACKERS. Oh my gosh. Modded/hacked lobbies and tons of players with hacks, i.e. aimbots, etc. Please, please, please do not buy this game.

Nowadays it's not that easy to find the ammount of players that we used to find back at 2010 but still MW2 has its fans. The campaign and co-op modes worthy enough of the 12,49€ and if you're looking for something to spend some cash on it I think this game is a pretty good solution.

There is also a mp_config.cfg, but I believe for MW2, additions there are either limited or completely restricted for obvious reasons (Unfortunate as COD4 did allow for a more limited FOV adjustment & other non-balance related commands).\n\nFind seta monkeytoy "1" (can be found easily by searching monkey with Ctrl+F) and change it to seta monkeytoy "0".\n\nCopy the following as shown (in Bold) right below all existing text:\n\nspu\n\nset developer "0" (You may need to change this to "1" initially, but switching it back to "0" after I made my binds, they worked just as before. You'll want to switch it to "0" as otherwise you'll get a lot of yellow dev text during many segments of gameplay that only the No-HUD bind can otherwise switch off)\nset sv_cheats "1"\nset thereisacow "1337"\n\nFrom this point, you'll be able to bind keys to such things as FOV, viewmodel distance, HUD on/off, Noclip, and others (As unlike it's predecessors, Modern Warfare 2 doesn't allow access to the Developer Console). Just make sure that when you're done, Right Click on "config.cfg", go to "Properties", and then tick "Read Only" when you're done, just to make sure your configurations aren't reset when you load up the game.\n\nThe related articles from the  PC Gaming Wiki [pcgamingwiki.com] &  Call of Duty Wiki [callofduty.wikia.com] can provide more information on what binds can be made.\n\nPersonally, I use:\n\nbind 8 "cg_fov 80" = FOV 80° (Viewmodel FOV is also affected by this change)\nbind 9 "cg_fov 90" = FOV 90° (Viewmodel FOV is also affected by this change)\nbind O "cg_draw2D 1" = HUD On\nbind P "cg_draw2D 0" = HUD Off (EVERYTHING aside from viewmodels is wiped clean, including subtitles until HUD is truned back on)\nbind 0 "cg_gun_x -1" = Viewmodel position -1, X axis (Note that this will affect ironsights, so adjusting the Y & Z axis won't improve gameplay. Editing the X axis positively will take your viewmodels further, whilst editing it negatively will bring your viewmodels closer, which can be benefitical on FOV 90° & above if you want to avoid seeing floating shotgun shells or "through the shoulder" on a very select few weapons whose animations weren't fully suited to FOVs above 80 or below)\nbind - "cg_gun_x 0" = Default Viewmodel Distance\n\nYou can assign any key you want for your binds (That the game's controls isn't currently using of course) and set any value within it's range you wish to such things as FOV (Say, you can have 85° or 96° if you wanted), but those are my preferences as they're far out of reach from my default controls and can't be accidentally pressed.\n\nThere are third-party tools to adjust FOV in multiplayer (Which unlike during Call of Duty: Ghosts' launch period, will not get you banned either by Infinity Ward & Activision nor by Valve's Anti-Cheat System). A Steam Guide here has the tool & details: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=154105687\n\nRight, with that cleared up.\nMy Review\nWell, I can quickly state that while it's arguably one of the weaker titles in the franchise, it's definitely not the weakest PC release, despite being clear it's a console port. It runs very well, being not particularly tasking on HDD space nor performance by today's standards (Although being capped at 91fps may not be convenient for those with 120hz+ monitors or a real need for FPS, aswell as a select number of chipsets reportedly being unsupported for the Mac OSX port, which the PC Gaming Wiki article can detail if necessary). I certainly can't name any performance issues on my end.\n\nSingleplayer\nThe Singleplayer experience can be summed up as "Call of Duty 4 cranked to 11", as unlike it's more believable predecessor who rarely took away the player's control while the cinematic events occured, the setpieces are both in abundance & high spectacle, with numerous quick-time events to boot, for which many are memorable often thanks to the strong soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer & Lorne Balfe.\n\nSpec Ops (Co-op)\nThe 2-Player co-op experience, "Spec Ops" is actually one of Modern Warfare 2's stronger features. It's a mission based mode with a wide variety of gameplay elements & objectives, which either originate from Modern Warfare 2 & Call of Duty 4 or occasionally are unique to Spec Ops, all with a Three Star system awarded based on either difficulty completion, time completion or other mission unique tiers. Such things as a Snowmobile race & time trail, covering a co-op partner from a Black Hawk or AC130, or getting All Ghillied Up together, along with the more classical eliminate all targets, survive or complete-a-mission affairs. Whilst most of these can be played solo, there are a small number of missions that do require a co-op partner (Along with some where a Co-op partner is ideal to completing Veteran difficulty, especially with being able to revive each other presents it's own strategies). With the right buddy, it can be quite the fun!\n\nMultiplayer\nI can only give you my experience from the Xbox 360, but based on the brief return on PC just for experimentation's sake, not an awful lot has changed. I don't know how abundant hacking remains (To which on Xbox 360, it was utterly rampant!) but I have heard concerns from players that not only is hacking still rampant, but you yourself could be at risk from being VAC-Banned just by joining a matchmade game with or controlled by said hackers (I've had a somewhat similar experience in Gears of War 2 when my stats were permanently affected by being matchmade with illegitimate players, aswell as an occasion I was matchmade with hackers on MW2 [X360], which although neither resulted in any official bans, I'd say the concern should be at least considered valid), so it may be wise to proceed with caution if you wanna play Multiplayer outside of Private Matchplay, or be prepared to hightail it if you notice anything very unusual. Regardless, I can probably sum it up as a pit of out-of-control chaos with "noob-tubing" & death from above everywhere! (As this is Call of Duty 4 Multiplayer cranked to 17, which I personally classify as not a good thing). Perks have evolved from their more subtle kit choices to something comparable to super-hero powers, especially when you get their Pro upgrades (Commando Pro being among the most notorious). As for the Kill-Streaks, well, instead of being the assisting tools of winning the game, a significant selection pretty much is the gameplay & game-winners to anyone who can manage to avoid dying. You can rain death-from-above on a massive scale with AC130s, Attack Helicopters, Harriers, Bombing Runs, Stealth Bombers, Predator Missiles, maybe more. And of course, reel in 25 kills with all that and you have it equipped, hit the Nuke to win the game! (Provided your team or the enemy doesn't do it for you before the bomb drops).\n\n\nVerdict\nWell, it's a limited recommendation. If you are willing to put your brain away for some utterly disorganised chaos of a multiplayer, eager to gear up for a potentially challenging co-op mode, or want a short & somewhat dumb (as a whole), but highly explosive & cinematic singleplayer experience, then I can recommend it.\n\nIf you're looking for something more exceptional and/or refined, I can gladly say that the PC platform has a large quantity of offerings to cater to that need.","December 5, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nowadays it's not that easy to find the ammount of players that we used to find back at 2010 but still MW2 has its fans. The campaign and co-op modes worthy enough of the 12,49€ and if you're looking for something to spend some cash on it I think this game is a pretty good solution.

Secondary Weapons - Machine Pistols, Shotguns, Handguns, Launchers. Riot Shields. Equipment - Throwing Knives, Blast Shield, Tactical Insertion. Perk Upgrades. Bling (Dual Attachments). Customizable Killstreaks - AC130, Sentry Gun, Predator Missile, Counter-UAV, Care Package.\n\n'It's hard to see the majority of people wanting to play any other multiplayer shooter until the next CoD is released, such is the quality of what's on offer here.'\n\n'MW2 is a fantastic follow up that doesn't muddle too much with the mixture of success found in the original, but instead just adds some more depth and a much higher level of polish. Whether you're a fan of the original MW or a newcomer to the series, this is easily one of the must-play titles this year. Honestly, unless you're completely against playing games in which you shoot things, this game's excellent single-player campaign, enjoyable Special Ops mode, and addictive and nearly endless online multiplayer experience should put MW2 at the very top of your "to buy" list.'","July 6, 2014","true","48.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizargh/recommended/10180/","bizargh","Bizargh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizargh/","118 products in account","Before I give my thoughts on the game, allow me to provide some info on how to improve your experience, especially with FOV (Singleplayer & Spec' Ops)\nLocate your config.cfg file (Found in Steam > Steamapps > common > Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 > players). It can be opened with both Wordpad & Notepad, like a .txt file. There is also a mp_config.cfg, but I believe for MW2, additions there are either limited or completely restricted for obvious reasons (Unfortunate as COD4 did allow for a more limited FOV adjustment & other non-balance related commands).\n\nFind seta monkeytoy "1" (can be found easily by searching monkey with Ctrl+F) and change it to seta monkeytoy "0".\n\nCopy the following as shown (in Bold) right below all existing text:\n\nspu\n\nset developer "0" (You may need to change this to "1" initially, but switching it back to "0" after I made my binds, they worked just as before. You'll want to switch it to "0" as otherwise you'll get a lot of yellow dev text during many segments of gameplay that only the No-HUD bind can otherwise switch off)\nset sv_cheats "1"\nset thereisacow "1337"\n\nFrom this point, you'll be able to bind keys to such things as FOV, viewmodel distance, HUD on/off, Noclip, and others (As unlike it's predecessors, Modern Warfare 2 doesn't allow access to the Developer Console). Just make sure that when you're done, Right Click on "config.cfg", go to "Properties", and then tick "Read Only" when you're done, just to make sure your configurations aren't reset when you load up the game.\n\nThe related articles from the  PC Gaming Wiki [pcgamingwiki.com] &  Call of Duty Wiki [callofduty.wikia.com] can provide more information on what binds can be made.\n\nPersonally, I use:\n\nbind 8 "cg_fov 80" = FOV 80° (Viewmodel FOV is also affected by this change)\nbind 9 "cg_fov 90" = FOV 90° (Viewmodel FOV is also affected by this change)\nbind O "cg_draw2D 1" = HUD On\nbind P "cg_draw2D 0" = HUD Off (EVERYTHING aside from viewmodels is wiped clean, including subtitles until HUD is truned back on)\nbind 0 "cg_gun_x -1" = Viewmodel position -1, X axis (Note that this will affect ironsights, so adjusting the Y & Z axis won't improve gameplay. Editing the X axis positively will take your viewmodels further, whilst editing it negatively will bring your viewmodels closer, which can be benefitical on FOV 90° & above if you want to avoid seeing floating shotgun shells or "through the shoulder" on a very select few weapons whose animations weren't fully suited to FOVs above 80 or below)\nbind - "cg_gun_x 0" = Default Viewmodel Distance\n\nYou can assign any key you want for your binds (That the game's controls isn't currently using of course) and set any value within it's range you wish to such things as FOV (Say, you can have 85° or 96° if you wanted), but those are my preferences as they're far out of reach from my default controls and can't be accidentally pressed.\n\nThere are third-party tools to adjust FOV in multiplayer (Which unlike during Call of Duty: Ghosts' launch period, will not get you banned either by Infinity Ward & Activision nor by Valve's Anti-Cheat System). A Steam Guide here has the tool & details: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=154105687\n\nRight, with that cleared up.\nMy Review\nWell, I can quickly state that while it's arguably one of the weaker titles in the franchise, it's definitely not the weakest PC release, despite being clear it's a console port. It runs very well, being not particularly tasking on HDD space nor performance by today's standards (Although being capped at 91fps may not be convenient for those with 120hz+ monitors or a real need for FPS, aswell as a select number of chipsets reportedly being unsupported for the Mac OSX port, which the PC Gaming Wiki article can detail if necessary). I certainly can't name any performance issues on my end.\n\nSingleplayer\nThe Singleplayer experience can be summed up as "Call of Duty 4 cranked to 11", as unlike it's more believable predecessor who rarely took away the player's control while the cinematic events occured, the setpieces are both in abundance & high spectacle, with numerous quick-time events to boot, for which many are memorable often thanks to the strong soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer & Lorne Balfe.\n\nSpec Ops (Co-op)\nThe 2-Player co-op experience, "Spec Ops" is actually one of Modern Warfare 2's stronger features. It's a mission based mode with a wide variety of gameplay elements & objectives, which either originate from Modern Warfare 2 & Call of Duty 4 or occasionally are unique to Spec Ops, all with a Three Star system awarded based on either difficulty completion, time completion or other mission unique tiers. Such things as a Snowmobile race & time trail, covering a co-op partner from a Black Hawk or AC130, or getting All Ghillied Up together, along with the more classical eliminate all targets, survive or complete-a-mission affairs. Whilst most of these can be played solo, there are a small number of missions that do require a co-op partner (Along with some where a Co-op partner is ideal to completing Veteran difficulty, especially with being able to revive each other presents it's own strategies). With the right buddy, it can be quite the fun!\n\nMultiplayer\nI can only give you my experience from the Xbox 360, but based on the brief return on PC just for experimentation's sake, not an awful lot has changed. I don't know how abundant hacking remains (To which on Xbox 360, it was utterly rampant!) but I have heard concerns from players that not only is hacking still rampant, but you yourself could be at risk from being VAC-Banned just by joining a matchmade game with or controlled by said hackers (I've had a somewhat similar experience in Gears of War 2 when my stats were permanently affected by being matchmade with illegitimate players, aswell as an occasion I was matchmade with hackers on MW2 [X360], which although neither resulted in any official bans, I'd say the concern should be at least considered valid), so it may be wise to proceed with caution if you wanna play Multiplayer outside of Private Matchplay, or be prepared to hightail it if you notice anything very unusual. Regardless, I can probably sum it up as a pit of out-of-control chaos with "noob-tubing" & death from above everywhere! (As this is Call of Duty 4 Multiplayer cranked to 17, which I personally classify as not a good thing). Perks have evolved from their more subtle kit choices to something comparable to super-hero powers, especially when you get their Pro upgrades (Commando Pro being among the most notorious). As for the Kill-Streaks, well, instead of being the assisting tools of winning the game, a significant selection pretty much is the gameplay & game-winners to anyone who can manage to avoid dying. You can rain death-from-above on a massive scale with AC130s, Attack Helicopters, Harriers, Bombing Runs, Stealth Bombers, Predator Missiles, maybe more. And of course, reel in 25 kills with all that and you have it equipped, hit the Nuke to win the game! (Provided your team or the enemy doesn't do it for you before the bomb drops).\n\n\nVerdict\nWell, it's a limited recommendation. If you are willing to put your brain away for some utterly disorganised chaos of a multiplayer, eager to gear up for a potentially challenging co-op mode, or want a short & somewhat dumb (as a whole), but highly explosive & cinematic singleplayer experience, then I can recommend it.\n\nIf you're looking for something more exceptional and/or refined, I can gladly say that the PC platform has a large quantity of offerings to cater to that need.","December 5, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

An entirely new gameplay mode which supports 2-player co-operative play online that is unique from the single player story campaign. Special Ops pits players into a gauntlet of time-trial and objective-based missions. Rank-up as players unlock new Special Ops missions, each more difficult. Missions include highlights from the single player campaign, fan favorites from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and all new, exclusive missions. Setting a new bar for online multiplayer, Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer delivers new capabilities, customization, gamestates and modes, including: Create-a-Class Evolved. Secondary Weapons - Machine Pistols, Shotguns, Handguns, Launchers. Riot Shields. Equipment - Throwing Knives, Blast Shield, Tactical Insertion. Perk Upgrades. Bling (Dual Attachments). Customizable Killstreaks - AC130, Sentry Gun, Predator Missile, Counter-UAV, Care Package.\n\n'It's hard to see the majority of people wanting to play any other multiplayer shooter until the next CoD is released, such is the quality of what's on offer here.'\n\n'MW2 is a fantastic follow up that doesn't muddle too much with the mixture of success found in the original, but instead just adds some more depth and a much higher level of polish. Whether you're a fan of the original MW or a newcomer to the series, this is easily one of the must-play titles this year. Honestly, unless you're completely against playing games in which you shoot things, this game's excellent single-player campaign, enjoyable Special Ops mode, and addictive and nearly endless online multiplayer experience should put MW2 at the very top of your "to buy" list.'","July 6, 2014","true","48.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am one the biggest fan of this and other Call Of Duty games. But every game has it's flwas including Call of Duty such as: When the missiles blew up the sattelite, it came crashing down right at the exact spot where Ramirez was and so they were lucky. Also, how did Price even get in prison. But those are the little questions that no on really pays attention to. The thing that caught my attentio was how the enemy who remains the enemy "Makarov" helps out Price even though they want to strangle eachother. Also it was unique on how the main hero kills the main villain, with a throwing knife, now you dont see that in any other game. Also you had no suspicion that Shephard would betray you until he does.","May 4, 2014","true","31.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

MW2 has many flaws but overall it's a good game, the story is alright, it's just plain but it's good. Now, Modern Warfare 2: Multiplayer, the mp is actually decent, other than the final stand and noob toobing with OMA and the hackers. I personally got VAC banned for randomly joining a game and got my level to 70, which is stupid, but hey, it's whatever. Overall, I'd give this game an 8/10. Purchase this for spec ops and for the mp; if you don't mind the hackers and possibly getting VAC banned.\n\nOverall summary;\nGraphics: Good for it's time.\nGameplay: Smooth\nControls: Easy enough\nMultiplayer: Good, but at the same time, it's terrible.","July 28, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/10180/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on July 17, 2010\n\nMW2 contains nothing new. Very similar multiplayer to CoD4 (same formula) and very similar single player to CoD1 (exact same formula). Infinity Ward has proven once again that it has no idea how to innovate. Of course, why should they, with one of the best selling franchises of all time. And if these were all of my concerns, this would still be a pretty damn good game. However they only scratch the surface.\n\nGraphics/Audio/Presentation- The graphics engine for the series has not visibly changed in nature since call of duty 2. Despite what infinity ward says, I have seen no visible innovation or improvement in the engine, with the exception of new skins or slightly higher resolution models. This is because of the limiting hardware of current consoles. The game consequentially looks mediocre at best and is not well optimized on the PC. It runs rather poorly. The cinematic effects of course are rather good, with blood splattering your screen when you are hit and good usage of the first person perspective in cutscenes. The audio is for the most part good, with voice acting being quite good, but the gun sounds are rather tinny and canned. They don't really sound like real guns if you've ever fired one before.\n\nStory- The story is complete trash. Straight up. CoD 4 had a ridiculous premise, but at least it was somewhat coherent and it made some sense. Mw2 is even more over the top and makes NO SENSE AT ALL. no exaggeration, the plot seems to have been written by someone with a penchant for cinematic effects and a complete lack of storytelling ability. I wasn't even sure who I was (or why it mattered) more than half the time. I had to look up several articles online to even get a sense of what the plot was about, but it still doesn't make any sense at all.\n\nSingle- The single player gameplay itself is very linear, and really hasn't changed since CoD1. Regenerative health is maybe the only exception. ridiculous amounts of enemies shooting at you, and only you, ineffective allies, chase scenes etc. nothing new here. Exciting, but old and incredibly unrealistic\n\nMulti- The multiplayer is clearly the game's greatest strength. They have taken their addictive FPS/RPG multiplayer leveling system from CoD4 and refined it, and for the most part, it works very well. Unfortunately. The PC version of the multi is incredibly deficient. No dedicated servers, no mod support, no server browser. No choice of which map to play, or any choice. You are matched using P2P technology with other players on a random map in the gamemode of your choosing (what a luxury) and are forced to deal with whoever is selected by the system is host. It is an insult to PC gamers everywhere. In addition, the game costs 60 dollars, and the map packs are 15 bucks each for 4-5 maps, which any decent company would include for free in content updates. Multi is also completely infested with hackers, and VAC is unlikely to do anything about it.\n\nCoop- spec ops is a nice addition for playing with a buddy and can actually be quite challenging at times.\n\nOverall, the game is CoD, through and through, and if you don't mind the thought of the unchanged gameplay, the price tag, the lack of servers, the hackers, and the overpriced map packs, you will have a good time, and get many hours of fun out of this game.","December 31, 2013","true","21.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The campaign took CoD4's to a whole new level, and with the consulting of actual military scientist Larry Bond, it shows its strength. The Special Ops cooperative mode isn't that great, with an attempt to combine the popular coop campaign from World at War falling flat. The multiplayer is highly enjoyable in my opinion, though I can see why others might not like it. Infinity Ward balanced it by making nearly every weapon in the game absolutely overpowered, and it works in my opinion. Unfortunately, the MP is all but absolutely dead, due to the lack of dedicated servers. Still fun for 1v1s, though.","December 26, 2014","true","45.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kysimir/recommended/10180/","Kysimir","Shortlived","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kysimir/","202 products in account","I should preface this with the admittance that I am not a fan of First Person Shooters.  I played the original Medal of Honor and Call of Duty games before the franchises became more focused on special effects, shock value, and multiplayer than they were about storylines; but I had a falling out with the story when $60 games couldn't be expected to offer any more than three hours of enjoyment outside of dealing with the horde of snotty kids online.\n\nI did, however, play through Modern Warfare 1 and 2 as they went on sale, and I was thoroughly impressed.  As you can expect just by looking at the store page, the game is visually stunning.  What you don't see, however, is the storylines (plural) that you follow as Army Rangers and Spec Ops fight to ensure America's continued global dominance amidst emerging threats (MW 1) and to ensure America's survival as all hell breaks loose (MW 2).\n\nWhile the single player game is challenging (frustratingly so on some parts), the story line only gives you about 5 - 6 hours of gameplay.  What this game offers is continued single player play through challenges outside of the story arc, giving you an alternative to braving random games with complete strangers - who, let's face it, are probably better than you!\n\nAll in all, I'd give the game an 8/10.","January 8, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Still some parts doesn't make sence but still much better than the last CoD titles.\nIt has fights those look much more realistic than any CoD that came later. Less explosions in your face, more tactics, more immersion insted of "we put more pew-pew-pew and kaboom so it looks like cool skrimish there player doesn't get harmed".\n\nMost importantly, it has guns that feel and sound more or less like real ones. No carboard shooters.\n\nIt has stupid matchmaking system in Multiplayer where you can't chose a server you want to play on (only gamemode) and sometimes you get connected to a hacked server with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ custom game mode (zombie survival). You disconnect and try to get to another server with same gamemode but get connected back to the same server. Pefect.\nToo bad Acitvision closed down Four Delta One project - normal server browser system with server admins and much less hackers. Looks like they follow steps of EA - challenge everything to make gameplay less comfortable.","May 18, 2014","true","30.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you thought the WaW campaign was good, wait untill you see this one. Sniping into a russian base turns into close combat firefights. You need this game just to experience the campaign\nSpecial Ops - Pretty decent. If you want maps that you can remember from CoD4 and MW2, play this mode. You can run the S.S.D.D couse untill you can nail it with a 30 second run.\nMultiplayer - Decent but bad. Why is it bad? Hackers, hackers everywhere. I get lucky enough to not get hacked lobbies as much as i used to. Hitting level 70 legit is pretty difficult. But i managed it and it can be done\n10/10.

The campaign took CoD4's to a whole new level, and with the consulting of actual military scientist Larry Bond, it shows its strength. The Special Ops cooperative mode isn't that great, with an attempt to combine the popular coop campaign from World at War falling flat. The multiplayer is highly enjoyable in my opinion, though I can see why others might not like it. Infinity Ward balanced it by making nearly every weapon in the game absolutely overpowered, and it works in my opinion. Unfortunately, the MP is all but absolutely dead, due to the lack of dedicated servers. Still fun for 1v1s, though.","December 26, 2014","true","45.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As far as single player is concerned, the plot of the storyline is really interesting and intense that keeps you attached till the end. It's not all about killing enemies in a battlefield like many other ordinary first person games. The storyline is structured in such way, that brings an abundance of emotions and suspense. In addition, the missions that are involved in the Spec Ops game mode are really enjoyfull and challenging. The huge variety of well built maps and different tasks included in the missions followed by rewards make the particular game mode extremely amusing. When it comes to multiplayer, words are not enough to express the greatness of this game. Personally, I believe that Modern Warfare 2 offers the best online experience in the "Call of Duty" franchise. There is not a single Call of Duty game so far that can be compared to MW2 when it comes to online experience. By the huge number of  extraordinary challenges, game modes, titles, emblems, killstreaks, perks, attachments, camos, pretty exquisite maps and guns, this section of the game is extremely addictive and absolutely close to perfection. The only problem is the small amount of cheaters that sometimes ruin the online experience. But not that big of a deal. For me, definetely a "must play" for fps gamers. It's a 9.9 out of 10 by me.","March 2, 2015","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is the peak of mindless fun. I honestly liked the campaign. For the most part, it was boring but the plot built up with my monotonous expression on my face until I felt I was engaged enough to want to finish it. They managed to make a badass character and I dont think I need to mention that character. Infinity ward know how to do good storytelling but I'm just not that invested in the setting or gameplay. Why am I playing it? Because it was just there on my library and I wanted to give it a review. So I beat the campaign. For any CoD fan, I'm sure you will like this more than me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/10180/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on July 17, 2010\n\nMW2 contains nothing new. Very similar multiplayer to CoD4 (same formula) and very similar single player to CoD1 (exact same formula). Infinity Ward has proven once again that it has no idea how to innovate. Of course, why should they, with one of the best selling franchises of all time. And if these were all of my concerns, this would still be a pretty damn good game. However they only scratch the surface.\n\nGraphics/Audio/Presentation- The graphics engine for the series has not visibly changed in nature since call of duty 2. Despite what infinity ward says, I have seen no visible innovation or improvement in the engine, with the exception of new skins or slightly higher resolution models. This is because of the limiting hardware of current consoles. The game consequentially looks mediocre at best and is not well optimized on the PC. It runs rather poorly. The cinematic effects of course are rather good, with blood splattering your screen when you are hit and good usage of the first person perspective in cutscenes. The audio is for the most part good, with voice acting being quite good, but the gun sounds are rather tinny and canned. They don't really sound like real guns if you've ever fired one before.\n\nStory- The story is complete trash. Straight up. CoD 4 had a ridiculous premise, but at least it was somewhat coherent and it made some sense. Mw2 is even more over the top and makes NO SENSE AT ALL. no exaggeration, the plot seems to have been written by someone with a penchant for cinematic effects and a complete lack of storytelling ability. I wasn't even sure who I was (or why it mattered) more than half the time. I had to look up several articles online to even get a sense of what the plot was about, but it still doesn't make any sense at all.\n\nSingle- The single player gameplay itself is very linear, and really hasn't changed since CoD1. Regenerative health is maybe the only exception. ridiculous amounts of enemies shooting at you, and only you, ineffective allies, chase scenes etc. nothing new here. Exciting, but old and incredibly unrealistic\n\nMulti- The multiplayer is clearly the game's greatest strength. They have taken their addictive FPS/RPG multiplayer leveling system from CoD4 and refined it, and for the most part, it works very well. Unfortunately. The PC version of the multi is incredibly deficient. No dedicated servers, no mod support, no server browser. No choice of which map to play, or any choice. You are matched using P2P technology with other players on a random map in the gamemode of your choosing (what a luxury) and are forced to deal with whoever is selected by the system is host. It is an insult to PC gamers everywhere. In addition, the game costs 60 dollars, and the map packs are 15 bucks each for 4-5 maps, which any decent company would include for free in content updates. Multi is also completely infested with hackers, and VAC is unlikely to do anything about it.\n\nCoop- spec ops is a nice addition for playing with a buddy and can actually be quite challenging at times.\n\nOverall, the game is CoD, through and through, and if you don't mind the thought of the unchanged gameplay, the price tag, the lack of servers, the hackers, and the overpriced map packs, you will have a good time, and get many hours of fun out of this game.","December 31, 2013","true","21.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kysimir/recommended/10180/","Kysimir","Shortlived","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kysimir/","202 products in account","I should preface this with the admittance that I am not a fan of First Person Shooters.  I played the original Medal of Honor and Call of Duty games before the franchises became more focused on special effects, shock value, and multiplayer than they were about storylines; but I had a falling out with the story when $60 games couldn't be expected to offer any more than three hours of enjoyment outside of dealing with the horde of snotty kids online.\n\nI did, however, play through Modern Warfare 1 and 2 as they went on sale, and I was thoroughly impressed.  As you can expect just by looking at the store page, the game is visually stunning.  What you don't see, however, is the storylines (plural) that you follow as Army Rangers and Spec Ops fight to ensure America's continued global dominance amidst emerging threats (MW 1) and to ensure America's survival as all hell breaks loose (MW 2).\n\nWhile the single player game is challenging (frustratingly so on some parts), the story line only gives you about 5 - 6 hours of gameplay.  What this game offers is continued single player play through challenges outside of the story arc, giving you an alternative to braving random games with complete strangers - who, let's face it, are probably better than you!\n\nAll in all, I'd give the game an 8/10.","January 8, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
