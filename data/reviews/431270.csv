You try to navigate to the end, and gets more challenging later on as you have to move other goo blocks to switches in a very precise way.\n\n+ Very challenging, great for people looking for a difficult puzzle game\n+ Quite a lot of content, i believe there's 50 stages\n\n- It gets a bit too difficult early on for me personally, and many stages are very time consuming (expect to fail a lot)\n- The background music is a bit annoying after a while\n- I did not like how overly bright and vibrant every block was\n- After you fail you have to wait for the tiles to drop down and get into place which takes a bit longer than it should\n- I feel like the game lacks variety which is the main reason I did not enjoy this game.\n\nOverall I can't recommend this game because it just wasn't for me. I will say that it is a pretty challenging puzzle game and is probably wonderful for those who truly like to challenge themselves.","February 4","false","7.3"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kipofmudd/recommended/431270/","kipofmudd","KipofMudd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kipofmudd/","155 products in account","Just a quick review for those who have played the other two goocubletes:\n\nSame mechanics however this one's gimmick is that the floor disappears when a cube with a matching color lands on it. It kind of reminds me of unium in a way because you will most likely not be able to go back on a square you have already crossed.\n\nAnother neat addition is the 6 seconds before a round you have a 3x3 platform you cannot fall off of that you use to position your cubes, when there's multiple ones, in a way that will help complete the puzzle.\n\nAs some negative notes, I think the music sucks and I mute it. The  cube will still bug out and be in two different squares basically forcing a restart like in the previous games. There's no undo but that doesn't bother me like it does others, just listing it for the people that wanted it last time.\n\nFor people who don't have experience with goocubelets:\n\nYou're moving a cube and round to get it on a goal marker. You also have to push other cubes onto their respective color goals too, however this is accomplished by hitting the non controlled cube with your cube. The catch is that there has to be a space in between these two cubes. Some levels will have you controlling multiple cubes at once and require you to move quickly to jump over gaps.\n\nI would recommend the original goocubelets over this one if you haven't played this before.\n\nAll in all, this is a good addition to the franchise. Surpassing the second and not really stacking up to the first, yet offering it's own charm.","January 4","true","6.5"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","10","16","2","0"

Jumping gaps is much more consistent than it used to be, but you'll still see cubes wind up coming to a stop halfway between grid spaces every once in a while.\n\nIt's a little irritating that you have to wait almost 10 seconds on every level attempt for the tiles to all come down.  I realize why -- sometimes it's important to use that time to reposition the cubes in the starting zone -- but it's a bit irritating is all.\n\nIt really does feel like I'm damning it with faint praise, and I'm not sure how to phrase things more favorably.  I'm enjoying it so far, but it's taken three games just to have something MOSTLY reliably playable, and after how badly the first two games soured me I wouldn't have even given it a chance if it didn't show up in my library for free.  As is, it's...passable?  Let's just say $2 is probably a reasonable price for it.","March 2","false","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tigertrix/recommended/431270/","tigertrix","TigerTrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tigertrix/","578 products in account","This is much worse than GooCubelets original.  It is the same mechanics and visuals, and starts you right off with a different mechanic than the original where you hop over spaces that fall away after you visit.  However, the problem is that these spaces float down slowly into place at the start of the level, and every time you reset after you screw up.  Being force to wait for these, and timed against it too, became really annoying really fast.  In the original, restarting a level was pretty trivial so the lack of an undo action wasn't really a big deal.  However now that I am punished to wait for the animation every time, I got bored very quickly and didn't care to spend more time trying to get a level right.  The levels are harder than the original at first.  Or at least they take more trial an error.  But again, this means more restarts and waiting for the animation to stop for the falling tiles.  It wasn't worth my time to continue.  But if for some reason you loved the original, then this one is more of it, at a slightly slower pace.","March 13","false","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
