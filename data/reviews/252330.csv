"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/252330/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The original Slender, released in the summer of 2012, was an experimental horror game that dropped you into a spooky forest with nothing but a flashlight to guide your way and a faceless entity known as the Slender Man following your every step. Despite having rough, simple graphics, it was a chilling gameplay experience. Slender: The Arrival, a reimagining of the original game, once again sets players up to encounter the enigmatic Slender Man, this time with a much more robust story, improved visual design, and just as many scares.The Arrival has you play as Lauren, a young woman who is visiting her friend Kate. Kate is selling her isolated family home after her mother's death, but upon your arrival, you find Kate's house mysteriously empty. The doors are wide open, there's furniture knocked around, and there's several mysterious notes about repressed memories and hallucinations... then you see a strange figure watching you from outside the window. It isn't long before you realize something terrible has happened to Kate, and it's up to you to find out where she is and why she disappeared.One of the first things you'll notice about The Arrival is that along with a significantly overhauled visual design compared to the original, it features a very dark and foreboding atmosphere that does an excellent job of keeping you on edge, if not outright terrified. Whether its hunting down those eight infamous pages in the remake of the original forest level from Slender, or scrambling to turn on an elevator in an abandoned mining facility, you'll rarely feel that you're in a safe enough spot to stand still and catch your breath. Much like the original game, you're almost completely defenseless, and all you have with you is a flashlight and the ability to sprint for short distances. However, you'll have to worry about how often you use your light and how much noise you make, since your pursuers rely on both to track you down. Deciding between whether you should try being stealthy and risk getting lost in the dark environment, or dashing to your objectives as fast as possible knowing that you're more likely to run right into the Slender Man's open arms, can be an unnerving choice to make. The implacable Slender Man is as imposing and aggressive a foe as ever, and often the only notice you'll have that he's caught up to you is a slight distortion that ripples across your screen... occasionally followed by him flashing directly in front of you in a cacophony of digital noise and electronic screams.While the stages do have randomness to them in the form of starting locations, landmarks or key items being different each time you play through a stage, most feel like they could have had more variety. Almost all follow a similar formula of "find X number of objects while trying not to die horrifically." What really hurts The Arrival the most, though, is how short it is.Slender: The Arrival is a significant improvement over Parsec Production's original game, featuring a much more robust narrative, and a darker, more foreboding atmosphere. You may have mixed feelings about its brevity and the repetitive mechanics, but it's certainly a well-built game that, above all, is scary to play.","June 24, 2015","true","28.8"," 258 of 285 people (91%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","91","258","285","12","1"

You come across an abandon vehicle on the road. The sun quickly sets, leaving you in the dark without a flashlight and suddenly, you aren't alone anymore. You are being watched and stalked by something. It feeds off of the power of your video camera, which is the only way to see it (I guess).\n\nWhen your video camera flickers, it is closing in on you. It is drawing the power from the batteries as it draws near. It is Slenderman. A tall thin humanoid creature that looks over you from afar from hilltops. The creature that opens the doors that you just closed. The creature that your only defense is to not look at it. To wish it away as you cower in fear by looking at the ground. No... just run away until your video recorder stops flickering. How do you run from something that just teleports in front of you? You can always walk backward.\n\nThis is Slender: The Arrival, less of a game and more of a first person experience along the lines of Dear Esther and Gone Home. It preys on your fears. It has a great, creepy atmosphere and great sound design. You have little in the way of controls, left stick to move, right stick to look, a sprint button, flashlight button, zoom button, and a use button. There are other buttons, but they feel redundant.\n\nThe game dumps you in and never explains why you're there. Not just the first chapter of the game, but over and over again, its the same thing, you start at dusk in the woods and go into the night and then find an abandon building. Each chapter has a different task, such as turn on X generators, find X pages in the woods and close X windows. Simple things, but you're just stuck with something that can be anywhere at anytime that will warn you when its near. The more things you collect, the more intensely you will be harassed.\n\nAs you wander in the dark you quickly come across an average house. Depending on where you enter, it looks like there is nothing wrong. Just a normal house for sale with a playground in the back. Soon enough you'll find things scrawled on the walls and rooms in disarray. Eventually, you'll find a flashlight that will help you. The idea of wandering in the woods might seem like an easy way to get lost, but as you roam the darkness, you'll be enticed by audio and visual cues such as paths, lights and dozens of arrows pointing in one direction that will guide your way.\n\nIf you think you'll get used to Slenderman, once you progress far enough, eventually you will reach an abandon facility and have a follower. Perhaps it is a follower of the Slenderman, but it follows, chases and strangles you. This isn't a creature like Slenderman, so it doesn't have magical powers other than it is getting closer, running after you. You'll hear its footsteps running up to you. Your only defense is to focus your flashlight and blind it. That adds something different to the game. Getting trapped in a side room means there is no way out and no where to run away from the follower.\n\nIt is a toss up if this experience is for you. If finding stuff in the dark isn't for you then skip it. You'll be searching open areas for sometimes tiny things (sheets of paper). Lost in the woods and abandon buildings. Being thrown off your direction from having to run away and forced to figure out where you're going again in an area that is mostly woods. If you can't handle bobbing and weaving cameras, avoid this game. It might be a nitpick but sometimes the camera seems to be at a person's waist. The height of a sink or a doorknob.\n\nI couldn't really recommend Dear Esther or Gone Home. They were both beautiful and immersive, but I didn't feel anything playing those games like I did with Slender: The Arrival. Is it worth $10 for an hour or two of gameplay? I feel like I was engaged and always challenged by a single strange foe with powers to teleport anywhere.","October 15, 2014","true","4.1"," 195 of 228 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","195","228","10","5"

Took me 3.6 because I'm a thorough explorer and I died a lot... first time I saw Slender I just ran right up to him to say hi... But other than that, it's much better than expected. And well worth it at the sale price of 3.99. I would place it somewhere between The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and Outlast, as far as style and gameplay. If you like either one of those, and a good jumpscare, you'll like this one. The story seemed like a prologue, so hopefully it's just The Arrival and we'll see some fully fleshed out sequels.

You are only equipped with a flashlight. You have to explore various locations and search for clues to your friend's whereabouts, while avoiding an unspeakable fate at the hands of Slender man himself. On your way you can pick up various papers that give you background information on the story, or clues.\nThere are no problems with controls and everything feels very smooth. The game itself is too short, it takes around 1 hour to finish.\nThe graphics are good, you will not be disappointed. Slender Man himself looks awesome, in my opinion this is the best Slender Man model of every Slender game. Everything else in the game, from the trees, to the rocks and so on looks pretty well, no complaints here.\nThe music is great, it really adds to the experience. You can hear that slow thumping in the background from the original Slender game when you pick up that first page in one of the levels. The sound effects are also good, sometimes you will hear the sounds of footsteps from someone or something other than you in the forest close by, or you will hear the Owls hooting at night, and other various forest sounds.\nI can recommend Slender: The Arrival to people who wants a good fun scare or a nice horror game and of course all fans of the original Slender Man game. Fans of the original Slender will be happy to know that the original game is remade in one of the levels.\n\nSounds 8/10\nGraphics 8/10\nGameplay 6/10\nAtmosphere 8/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","March 13, 2014","true","4.1"," 238 of 301 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","238","301","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/252330/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Slender: The Arrival is the follow-up to the popular freeware horror game, Slender: Eight Pages, being made by the people responsible for making Slender so popular (Mark J. Hadley, creator of Slender: Eight Pages, and the Marble Hornets team who made a series of Slender-themed YouTube videos). It's not just another Slender clone though, it goes for a more cinematic approach to gaming, and not as in fixed cutscenes or QTEs, but in providing an interactive cinematic horror experience.\n\nThe stories pretty simple. You are going to check in on a friend who lives deep in the forest who hasn't been responding to calls, texts, or emails for the last few days. Turns out, there's evil that lurks in these woods... Now can you escape?\n\nSlender: The Arrival is probably the closest you'll get to playing a found-footage horror film in game form, at least yet. The way everything is told through the gameplay's lens, the 'folk-story' tone the game goes with the legend, the execution of how Slender and the events that transpire work, feels very much in-line with a found-footage horror film, except you are the driver and the one tasked with capturing it all and surviving.\n\nIn that regard, Slender: The Arrival is a very cool experience. It has some good build-up, atmosphere, and escalates the situation while still retaining a more down-to-earth feeling. All through gameplay, you experience a series of events and have to respond to them.\n\nThe basic Slender gameplay is still there... Collect different items and avoid the big tall man in the suit, but there's more to it here, and this is often where the split in opinion on this game begins.\n\nThe game is rather short, and honestly you probably spend more time just exploring places in-between the game's 'main' stages than you do actually playing the core Slender gameplay.This mainly involves going around locations, like a forest trail or a house, and opening doors to get to the next story location.\n\nSlender: The Arrival is split into nine 'stages', five of them in the story, one as a secret hidden level, two of them were added post-patch to make a hidden new miniature story, and one as a bonus stage. Beating the story should take 2-4 hours the first time (the five main stages), and consist of two stages with you actually collecting items, two scenarios with you avoiding Slender via other means 'cinematically',  and most of these stages as well as one stage entirely having 'build-up' situations where nothing actually happens, but it builds-up to the next main gameplay scenario.\n\nThe length and the cinematic direction the game takes will turn some people off, but on my part it actually made me enjoy the game more. It legitimately feels like a playable found-footage horror film, and has charm and atmosphere in its design and oppressive stages. I found myself enjoying it during its short course.\n\nI even got scared a few times, something the original Eight Pages and many Slender clones don't do to me. Scariness is subjective, but a feat I must mention as I don't actually find the character of Slender to be scary in general.\n\nThis said, I found myself more terrified by Slender's 'unidentified' masked assistant than Slender himself. She's a stalker who appears in a specific stage in the game, and her sounds, appearance, animations, and the environment you encounter her in legitimately made me afraid of her for a time.\n\nHowever, for all of this 'cinematic charm' I'm spouting about, the game maybe alienated its main audience in some ways, as part of the charm of the original Slender game was with its minimalistic atmospheric gameplay and dreary feeling without need for story, explanation, and just throws you right in. This is a very different experience and very different game, and these changes completely alters the audience the game is designed for... And unfortunately, with a character who's been popularized like Slender, it can mean the game's audience is potentially very small, as some have come to ridicule or dislike his popularity and character, and those that like him may not like the way the game is designed differently and more aimed as a playable cinematic horror game.\n\nI feel fond of it though, and it happens to be my favorite Slender-based game for the very reason of how its different. I find it to be enjoyable to play, and to experience, and craft an interesting world and scenario that was immersive to go through.\n\nThis all said, the best parts of the game maybe came out of the optional content. The 'bonus stage I mentioned is simply a recreation of the original Eight Pages game you can play outside of the main story, but a lot prettier. The game has difficulty levels and randomized features through all of its stages which is interesting. There are a variety of secrets and Easter eggs in the game, including a hidden ending.\n\nThe two post-patch stages based around a village and a farm take criticism from the game and made really moody set-pieces that add extra elements to the story, though finding them is a bit tricky as they require specific actions during the game's main story.\n\nAnd for me, the absolute best part of the game was the secret level. I don't want to spoil it here, but at least for me, it was definitely the creepiest part of the whole game, but a shame most probably wouldn't find it without looking it up... It's pretty well hidden.\n\nSlender The Arrival isn't for everybody and ditches the minimalist direction for something more akin to a game version of a found-footage horror film, but during its short duration it delivers an interesting different take on both Slender and cinematic horror games. I'd say worth a trip for those who think the idea of playing a found-footage horror film sounds appealing.","July 9, 2014","true","4.0"," 127 of 151 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","127","151","0","2"

I mean A LOT.  I'm always in search of that thrill which horror MOVIES can rarely give me any more, which means I want a game to SCARE me.  Slender: The Arrival is definitely scary.  In fact, it's possibly the single scariest game I've ever played.  You want to know why?  BECAUSE IT CHEATS.\n\nOkay, a confession before I go on.  I'm seriously beginning to suspect I'm actually really BAD at video games.  I mean, all that hand-eye coordination and lightning reflexes stuff...it's just not me.  I have the reflexes of a snail (a fast and lively snail, perhaps, but a snail regardless), and I can barely even shoot straight in first-person shooters.  I'm pretty crap, honestly.  So how, you ask, do I manage to complete so many games, some even on the hardest difficulty levels?  Because I'm not afraid to go back to the last save/checkpoint and redo sections a bit better than last time (waste less ammo and medkits, etc), and I'm smart enough to learn from my mistakes.  THAT'S IT.  Nothing else.  Enough of talk of ME, then, and let's get back to this game...\n\nLet's start with save/checkpoints.  There AREN'T any, basically.  You complete a Chapter, and you unlock the next one for future play.  But not much of anything DURING said Chapters (of which there are a mere six).  Which means if you manage to turn on FIVE out of SIX freaking generators, then DIE, you have to go back to the FIRST generator.  I know this is some people's idea of a "challenge", but personally, it just infuriates the living CHRIST out of me.  But hey, you know what?  Sometimes this style of game design CAN work, up to a point, as long as the player:  a. Doesn't get thrown back a full TWENTY MINUTES of gameplay, and b. Can apply what they've learned the last time to the new round of play.  Say, for example, in the scenario I've mentioned above, you can learn WHERE the final generator is, just before you are unceremoniously snuffed.  The problem here is...THE LOCATIONS OF THE GENERATORS ARE RANDOMLY CHOSEN.  Which means that while the game does arguably still have a "learning curve" of sorts, such as vaguely getting to know your way around the humungous bloody mine complex, the learning curve is very limited because you still basically have to stumble around blindly looking for the next blessed generator.  So it's that kind of situation where you'll activate three generators the first time you try, four the next time, TWO the time after that, FIVE the time after that and then all the way back to TWO for the, what are we up to, FIFTH BLOODY TIME?!?  In other words, there isn't much of a feeling of PROGRESS, something which I'm afraid I need to feel in ALL aspects of life, or else I just feel like GIVING THE ♥♥♥♥ UP.  A well-designed game will make you feel like you're getting gradually CLOSER to conquering the bit which is troubling you, and DOESN'T give the impression that whether or not you make it through THIS time is just down to sheer blind LUCK...\n\nWhich brings us to the NEXT problem with this game.  Far from feeling like it's all your own dumb fault when you DO cark it, this game is basically like playing a game of hide-and-seek where your pursuer has a distinct advantage over you, like being able to basically just APPEAR RIGHT NEXT TO YOU when they damned-well feel like it.  Not to mention, as each successive generator/note/whatever is found, the stakes are upped, which means that if generator number five is in a confined little room, activating it will in all probability cause your antagonist to immediately appear in doorway of said room, thereby reducing your chances of escaping them to precisely ♥♥♥♥-ALL.  All because of the sheer, dumb luck of where the generator randomly generated.  Sure I could probably try to muster up the courage to carefully stake out the entirety of the mine complex before touching a single generator, but by now my patience is LESS THAN ZERO and I could almost STRANGLE A PUPPY, and besides, I'd probably DIE before I even laid eyes upon all six generators, and really, IT'S JUST A ♥♥♥♥ING VIDEO GAME, NOT A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH, AND I HAVE OTHER THINGS I'D LIKE TO ACHIEVE WITH MY REAL LIFE BEFORE DYING IN IT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\n\nThe bottom line is this: Yes, I seek a decent "challenge" in a game, but I'm really not seeking the video game equivalent of banging my head against a brick wall.  Or if I do, I want to feel like that wall is gradually crumbling under MY weight, not the other way around.\n\nNow, you ready for the biggest shock of all?  I'm about to give this game a RECOMMENDATION.  I'm going to recommend it to all the people out there who believe that games SHOULD be stupidly hard, and believe that a game tossing in "unfair" random elements to make things harder is a perfectly legitimate way of creating a more "challenging" experience (and making a rather short game somewhat lengthier, I might add).  I'm also recommending it to anyone who, like me, enjoys a game which is ♥♥♥♥-scary and relentlessly atmospheric (which this is); though I would certainly suggest caution to anyone who requires things like STORY and LOGIC in order to enjoy a game (to wit: "Here I am looking for pieces of paper in the woods, for no apparent reason, while some tall demonic being is zipping about trying to kill me...and while I do this, I have a flashlight in one hand and a video camera in the other, the latter seemingly just an attempt to emulate the vastly superior Outlast, in which the video camera WAS the only light source, and the protagonist was at least a journalist willing to risk it all to get a great story, not just some girl looking for her sister...which I think is who I am and what I'm doing here.  Something like that.  To be honest, I forgot about fourteen retries ago")...\n\nNo doubt about it, this is definitely one game which will "frazzle the nerves", in both a good AND bad way.  For now I'm giving up on it, roughly half-way through, in spite of the fact that looking at other people's reviews/criticisms suggests that the third Chapter which I'm stuck on is by far the HARDEST of all the Chapters, which would suggest more inherent problems in the game's design which I'm yet to enjoy.  Maybe I'll feel the bravery to tackle this one again some day...or maybe I'll just decide to live out the rest of my years without the guilt of being a crazed PUPPY KILLER (see above, about fourteen frustrated paragraphs ago).  To anyone who hasn't yet bought this...make sure you buy Outlast first.  That's a game which knows how to RESPECT its players, without resorting to heavy-handed, bully-like tactics to make sure the experience is indeed a "scary" one.  So close, but so far...\n\nVerdict: 7/10.","March 25, 2014","true","7.9"," 194 of 266 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","194","266","4","21"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/recommended/252330/","scares","Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/","666 products in account","Game name: Slender: The Arrival\nReviewed by: Wolf\n\nIn Summary...Slender: The Arrival is a superb horror game made in succession to the popular indie game Slender: The Eight Pages by Mark J. Hadley in 2012. The story follows Lauren, who is investigating a disappearance of her friend Kate, after arriving at her home late one evening to find her missing. Racing through the levels uncovering more clues via pages, the story begins to unravel and you will soon learn Kate's fate. With 8 chapters and a secret level, this game delivers a horrifyingly stunning grasp on the tale of the Slender man.\n\nControls:WASD - move character.\nMouse - look around.\nLeft click - interact with objects.\nEscape - pause.\n\nSounds:Slender: The Arrival is filled with horrifying sounds. If you've played the orginal title, you'll know when Slenderman gets near or is pursuing you, the screen becomes distorted and sharp noises peirce your ears. This can be especially jump-scare worthy in high-pressure moments, such as collecting the pages in Chapter 2, or turning on the generators in Chapter 3. Not only in addition to Slenderman, new characters are added in pursual of Lauren, meaning it's literally twice as scary! (bad pun intended)\n\nGraphics:Substantial. If you have the time, feel free to check out the screenshots I've made with this game, they're absolutely phenomenal. I do, however; wish the graphics were supported to double the resolution such as the option in games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter have.\n\nGame Balance:It is very easy to win this game. I have played multiple times through, so I've learned which paths to take and how to avoid Slenderman and others in a proficient way. Newcomers may find it more difficult, and if playing on hardcore mode, adds a little bit more of a challenge to the game. Still hoping for a mode beyond hardcore though, preferably a veteran mode of some sorts with more appearances, no lighting, and no sprinting.\n\nOtherFix achievements please. Currently there's a bug with the cloud saving, where if you resetstats in console, the game does not reset scrapbook nor steps, and deletes all achievements. This causes you to not be able to obtain the 10k steps achievement or the collector achievements. Easy fix = disable cloud saving. There's literally no need for a single player game like this.\n\nFinal Rating:8/10\n\nIn Conclusion:Absolutely a must have for any horror fan or veteran. This game offers a much more enticing tale and rivveting experience than the predecessor, The Eight Pages, as well as a much more stunning visual experience.\n\nPlease feel free to follow my curation page for more recommendations.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/russianlot/recommended/252330/","russianlot","Sir Russianlot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/russianlot/","768 products in account","EDIT: Spent few more hours on the game, rewrote parts of the review, fixed up some grammar\nyour comments and feedback matter, so please keep commenting :)\n\nRemember Slender: the Eight Pages?\nIt basically was a level where you collect 8 spooky pages with child drawings, while being chased by so called Slenderman. And while nothing really special, it was pretty fun, atmospheric and scary.\nNow, this game is basically the Eight Pages on steroids, which is both a good and bad thing...\n\nLet's start with positives:  1.  Game is very atmospheric and it gives you feeling of hopelessness. Since you only have a flashlight and a camera, your only options of defence is running away with your tail between your legs.\n2.  Sound design is pretty good. Wind blowing through trees, camera static, creepy ambient sounds and echoes sound pretty great.\n3.  There is also a new enemy type that you will meet on a few levels, adding some variaty.\n4.  If you are easily scared, you'll probably get your heart and adrenaline a nice little workout.\n5.  Game got some love with patches and some new (and old) levels completely for free, which is nice\n\nNow let's go over negatives and man, are there lot's of em:  1.  Story is basically non existent. You're there to find some boy or a girl, but why, where and when is never really explained, unless you find and read all the collectibles.\nEven then I had to go to on the internet to get my story fix. I know, it's a "scary simulator" but it is such a shame we don't get to know any of the rich lore behind Slenderman or ingame characters.\n2.  If you're into horror games, have played a few, or are not so easily scared - you will get bored pretty quickly. This game relies heavily on jump scares and spooky sound effects, which, while scary at first, will get repetitive pretty quickly\n3.  Difficulty is way to easy on easy (no pun intended) and medium but WAY to unforgiving on hardcore.\nOn medium you're pretty much unstoppable, save for a few spots, but on hardcore some levels are so EXTREMELY annoying and unforgiving, you'll be sent to the retry screen so fast, you'll think that the game has crashed and got stuck on the same screen.\nProtagonists movement speed is something of the worst I have ever expirienced! Your movement speed is comparable to a turtle and sprint makes no sense at all, since it's completely random... Sometimes when you spot Slenderman, your character will run like a Nascar vehicle on a rampage, but other times (especially when you really need to) you really start to wonder if main protagonist you play as has a death wish or something, since her run speed will be so bad, a toddler would crawl past her while he was asleep...\nIt also doesn't help that the game is just so dark 90% of the time, which lead to...\n4.  This game is so friggin dark... I mean brightness cranked all the way to maximum but still dark - dark!\nBut don't give me flak about that, I know Slender: the Arrival is supposed to be dark and spooky game, which is the point, but I mean really? This games darkness will give a black hole a run for it's money!\nEven with brightness at maximum, you are blind as a bat without you flashlight. You won't see crap and  it is really frustrating, especially on hardcore, because you flashlight have limited battery.\nGot 7 out of 8 pages but you flashlight depleted the battery? Might as well restart, since there is no way you'll be seeing anything, except maybe Slendermans buttcheeks rubbed against your face anyways if you're lucky.\n5.  Graphics are pretty terrible, even for a indie game. I mean, most of the game is dark and you won't be seeing much anyways. It still isn't good excuse for this game to look like Half Life 1. Textures looks old, muddy and dated, animations are just... basic, and water, trees and grass will probably make a senior pc enthusiast cry.\n6.  Game have been out for a year now, and it ran pretty terribly back then. Well, 1 year and 3 days later and it still performs somewhat terrible, even after patches...\nWhile not nearly as bad as before, on some spots however, this game will really live up to it's predecessors name, the Eight Pages since your top notch gaming beast machine will  cry and sweat  proficiently to spit 8 FPS out of this game\n7.  For me personally, Slender: the Arrival got repetitive pretty quickly. While game started out really great, jumpscares got old and missions became repetitive and just plain boring. But It's hardly a problem though since Slender: the Arrival is so amazingly short...\n8.  Yes, this game is alarmingly short. I mean REALLY, REALLY short. There is even an achivement for completing it in 45 min. Don't worry, it isn't hard since you can easily ace through it in no more than 30 min with some practice.\n\nTL;DR and/or conclusion: All in all, Slender: the Arrival is hit & miss. While some people will enjoy it, for me, it got boring really, really quickly.\nI was hoping for a really scary game with rich lore and lot's of exploration, but what I got was a boring, short, walking simulator with a lot of jump scares, bad graphics, non existent story which was way to easy on normal and way to frustrating and rage indusing on hardcore.\n\nMy honest opinion?\nTry it at friends house, get it on sale, or spend your money on something else","October 26, 2014","false","15.1"," 200 of 316 people (63%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","63","200","316","19","11"

The game does a great job of presenting scares in moderation which creates a prolonging sense of anticipation of what's going to happen next.\n\nAlthough the game can be relatively short, an initial playthrough should take several hours.

Sure, Slender : The Arrival looks and plays better than its freeware counterparts but overall it's a disappointing game, especially if you put it next to Amnesia : The Dark Descent, a game that helped the renewal of the horror genre.\n\nThe first chapter managed to set up effectively a scary mood. Exploring the house and its surrounding was really stressful and made me felt really vulnerable. I always expected the worse. The second chapter is more like a remake of Slender : The Eight Pages. While the scare factor was still there the experience felt repetitive. The third chapter is certainly where the game went downhill. The little child is creepy the first time he jumps at you but after a while it gets repetitive and at the end we don't care anymore. The chapter where the events unravel from someone's else perspective was really surprising but at the same time it was too short. At the end of Chapter 6, we are left with an unexpected but disappointing conclusion. The game just lasted 1h 30min.\n\nTo summarize, the lack of work on the game design is what hurt Slender the most. Playing the game feels more like walking on an alley of jumpscare than facing dangerous threats.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not against the idea of a commercial Slender game. I just wish the game could be more polished since it has so much potential.\n\nHopefully, the next commercial Slender game on PC will get everything right.\n\nRating :\n5.5","August 27, 2015","false","1.6"," 111 of 181 people (61%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","61","111","181","17","0"

Well, here’s how to overcome your terror: imagine that Slender Man himself is that awkward person you don’t want to talk to at any given party. As with any social space invader, the guy's core tactic is to materialise silently in front of you, perhaps peeking shyly from behind an object, in hopes of catching your eye. The trick is to let your gaze slide over him to something else in the environment - hey, isn’t that so-and-so from Marketing in the corner? - while stepping casually but firmly to one side.\n\nOK, so it’s not quite that simple. For starters, whenever Slender Man appears the screen goes nuts, stretching and splintering as though in the presence of an undersized black hole. Throw in all but perpetual nocturnal conditions and landscapes that are cluttered with loose objects, and you’ll often struggle to pinpoint your adversary’s precise location.\n\n\n\nMore troublingly, Slender Man’s the pushy type. The longer you succeed in escaping his clutches, and the more mission-critical items you collect, the more frequently he’ll show up and the closer he’ll get. And have we mentioned the context-sensitive score and audio effects? Because if that spidery, faceless guy in the suit doesn’t give you the willies, the cacophonous, grating report that sometimes accompanies his entrance certainly will.\n\nBut what if you’ve butted heads with Slender Man before? Well, The Arrival’s, er, arrival on Xbox One may struggle to impress. It’s largely the same game as on Xbox 360 with negligible visual enhancements and the same problem of diminishing returns. The jewel in the crown is the second level, a re-imagining of Slender: The Eight Pages in which you hunt for notes scattered around a forested area.\n\n\n\nThere are eight notes in total but 10 locations to investigate, some of which swap places between playthroughs, plus a selection of possible starting points, so no two sessions are alike. Prioritising areas in accordance with Slender Man’s aggressiveness is critical: when he’s at his most annoying, the last place you want to be is the Visitor’s Centre, with its plethora of single-exit rooms. There’s a run button to help you out of a jam, but it’s tied to an invisible stamina bar that’s easy to exhaust when the pressure is on.\n\nSadly, the scenarios (some accessed by collecting or interacting with certain objects) that make up the remaining hour or two of playtime consist of slightly limp variations on a gambit that isn’t nearly substantial enough to stand comparison with, say, fellow indie offering Outlast. The third level introduces a second foe who can be kept at bay with the beam of a flashlight; the echo of her footsteps through the depths of an abandoned mine is unnerving, but the basic explore-avoid-collect pattern is the same.\n\n\n\nA later, more intriguing chapter takes place on a farm estate with some catacombs at one end and a deceptively picturesque cornfield in the middle. It’s relatively elaborate, but it won’t keep you busy for long.\n\nIf you like horror, but you’ve yet to have the pleasure of Slender Man’s company, his Xbox One incarnation is absolutely worth its budget price tag. The Eight Page template loses its bite with repeat exposure, but the game’s volatility remains invigorating given the genre's continued reliance on scripted scares and sheer grotesqueness. If you’re a veteran of Slender, however, it’s probably best to avoid eye contact. There’s not enough meat on these bones.\n\nThis review is based on the Xbox One, Xbox 360 and PC versions of the game.","May 5","true","8.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","19","21","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/252330/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","This game is based on the phenomenon called Slender Man which was born in 2009 as a result of a photo contest announced in a forum. The name perfectly sums up who the antagonist is in these games - a slim, tall man wearing a black suit. Moreover, the creature in question is completely faceless just to add an even more terrifying look to it. Its author claims he was influenced by H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King and even by the Tall Man from the Phantasm horror films when making Slender Man.\n\nNow, the first game was titled The Eight Pages and was released in 2012. Parsec Productions developed and released it on Windows completely independently from Steam. Blue Isle Studios, a Canadian developer company saw even more opportunity in the concept and released it under the name The Arrival. This now has a backstory to the game and, of course, includes the levels found in The Eight Pages. This "sequel" was released in 2013 and since have become available on PS4 and Xbox One, too.\n\nNow, the gameplay is very simple in Slender The Arrival: we move around in abandoned places (houses, caves, mines, churches) trying to find a way out. In certain levels the objective is to collect something (see The Eight Pages)  - in such cases we have a limited time to complete our goal. Although the game does not give us a time limit the sound of the closing enemies becomes more and more frequent. Not doing anything for a long time or simply getting closer to the completion of our task provokes Slender Man.\n\nOur flashlight and the ability to run both remain our best buddies. Greater difficulty levels allow the flashlight batteries to completely run out and our stamina also depletes much faster. While the game has around 10 levels these do not provide us with increasing difficulty levels. In fact, I believe The Eight Pages remains the most difficult level, plus, it is the one that perfectly captures the phenomenon of this Internet-created antagonist.\n\nThe game has decent graphics thanks to the good-old Unity engine. Nowadays more and more Steam games appear utilising the same technology (e.g. Forest). Still, its atmosphere is where The Arrival shines. Its sound design and the constant threat of Slender Man appearing behind us can easily drive any player crazy. There's no blood / gore in this game unlike in Outlast - once Slender Man is in our perspective the screen gets distorted. The closer he gets the more distortion is applied.\n\nThe only downside for me was the added levels / backstory. The story did not make Slender Man more interesting. I felt it was unnecessary to include the characters as well as the many collectibles that are scattered throughout the levels and serve as the backbone of the game's story. Additionally, level number 2 (The Eight Pages) is simply so good that the rest of the game can't even come close to it.\n\nStill, The Arrival is a superb horror game with a great soundtrack and some pretty neat jumpscares. If you liked Amnesia, Forest, Outlast or similar survival horror games then you should give this a chance.","March 13","true","3.9"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"

Good atmosphere, right level of terror an puzzle solving that i was expecting. It then slowly degenerates from there. There's really no puzzle solving mid way through the game other then get from point A to B without dying. Some people maybe fine with this, but what made this unberable for me is that it's a short game.\n\nMy playthrough without rushing was a few minutes over 1 hour. I was not expecting the game to be this short. As well as being short the game doesn't have a story to it. You get a few pickups that give you a few tid bits of what could be a story but frankly you don't even need to pay attention to the story one bit to progress.\n\nThe ending is very weak as well. No explanations are given, you aren't even given a cliff hanger. It just ends. I picked this game up for $5 so don't feel too cheated. But i would not have gotten it for $10 nor have boughten it again for $5 if i knew what i did now.","December 23, 2013","false","1.8"," 46 of 71 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","46","71","0","0"

New levels, more story, another antagonist, and soo much replay value. I was very surprised at how satisfying the gameplay was, and it did quite a good job of making an erie atmosphere.

In Slender The Arrival you play as a girl by the name of Lauren. She gets a distress call from her friend Kate that shows she went missing. So as Lauren you find was taken by the mysterious figure that she named Slender. So its up to you to find Kate and stop Slender. Now hows the gameplay ? Its pretty simple all you do is walk around with youre flashlight and do the diffrent goals to escpape Slender. Its really hard to explain hows the gameplay works because theres many diffrent enviroments and goals to achieve but mostly all you have to do is turn on 6 of that or collect 8 of something. Which i found cheap for a game thats 10 dollars. The game will take you an hour to beat which isnt a bad thing. This games has many easter eggs to find as a hidden level that shows the identity of Slender and many notes to find. Overall this game is a fun horror game and will grant a good hour of fun and much more if you are willing to do a 100% run, it has a great atmoshpere which makes some of the levels really creepy and the Slender enemy terrafying but no matter what i suggest you wait for a discount i give Slender the Arrival a 7/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 31, 2013","true","2.7"," 36 of 57 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","36","57","0","3"

From the description it sounds like it can be quite scary but it's not true. From the game "the 8 pages" the slender progressed quite well with graphics but that's all. In this game you have to find a 9 year old girl named Katie. During your searching, you will come across with various buildings or places in which you can find boring jumpscares. The Arrival consists of nine levels in which you have to collect a variety of objects. In the second level you have find nine drawings with slenderman behind your back. If you die, you have to go again, but drawings will no longer be as before, what is for me really bad. The gameplay is seriously short and at that time I flinched maybe 2 times. I think, I have played a lot of horror games and that's why I haven't fear. Anyway, I have to mention dramatic music which gives the game a great atmosphere.

The mystery will draw you in to make you want to learn more about what you are getting yourself into. It sticks to a very basic control scheme anyone can use. You can expect to finish the game in 3 hours of play, but there is decent replay value.\n\n1.	Story – 4/10 After fully beating the game once, I was still confused at what I just experienced. You read notes throughout the game which give little pieces of information about what is going on and if you do not collect a large majority of them good luck figuring this story out! I could make some good guesses at what I think the story is, but I could easily be wrong on these also.\n\n2.	Difficulty – 4/10 While there is one particular area of the game I thought I might never beat, the rest was relatively easy. In fact the last half of the game I did not get a single game over.\n\n3.	Visuals – 7/10 The graphics in this game are decent. If you run the graphics on a higher setting it looks pretty nice and adds a slight touch to the atmosphere which is always appreciated in a horror game. Speaking of visuals, your flashlight will be your best friend in this game. When it is dark, it is DARK!\n\n4.	Audio – 9/10 This would have to be the best aspect of this game. If you really want to experience this game play this game with the volume turned up! The game is often quite and subtle which leaves the player feeling on edge as if something is about to jump out at any moment. When the pace picks up a little though, so will the background music. You will often here the antagonist movement long before you see him and in some scenarios hearing a baddie before you see them can be life or death!\n\n5.	Replay Value – 7/10 The game is short, but there are pages of plot hidden throughout the game that once you find, are added to a scrapbook you can view at anytime. Items on the map are randomly placed each time, although it does not vary much. This game is also great fun with friends because face it, who doesn’t like to see their friends pee their pants in fright. There are also steam achievements and steam trading cards to be found in this game.\n\n6.	Final Verdict – 6/10 The gameplay is very basic, the graphics are decent and the audio excels! The story is very confusing, but does not hinder the scare factor. Playing alone with the volume high is sure to give anyone some good jumps. It is a very short game but I enjoyed it all the way through.","December 4, 2013","true","7.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

It's not a terrible game by any stretch of the imagination, absolutely not - it definitely takes what The Eight Pages has done, and makes it even better, upping the spooks, the immersion, the atmosphere, and the detail as well as adding a nicely knit story (well, nicely knit for Slenderfans familar with vlogs like Marble Hornets and TribeTwelve, anyway) into the mix. There are some definitively terrifying scenarios there - being trapped underground with something chasing you, or having to close all the doors and windows in your house in the hopes that something doesn't get in. The game design, the game soundtrack, and the character models are all detailed and gorgeous, making you feel like you're really stuck in the woods alone as the sun goes down. The soundtrack really is stellar, seriously, you owe it to yourself to listen to it at least once - its ambient, eerie tones and soft undercurrents of dread really set the mood. Easily one of the best video game soundtracks of all time in my opinion.\n\nHowever, the game is still, very much so, flawed.\n\nWhy say it's flawed? Well, the premise of the game is the same idea we have seen so often in Slenderman games - run around, collect things, get jumpscared by Slenderman, rinse, repeat. The game definitely tries to frame this formula in a different light with different scenarios, but I suspect many people will not be able to get over the fact that the first three or four levels, barring the prologue, have you locating items and collecting them while all the while Slenderman is after you, or the Proxy is after you, or both. To be fair, the game does now, after the update, have about as many collection as non-collection levels to it, making it more even-handed, but it still relies on jumpscares, and that's where the other part of its flawed nature comes in. Jumpscares can be done well, or done very, very poorly. Whether or not you think the game handles it well or poorly is a matter of subjective interest, as everyone reacts to jumpscares differently. Generally, people who like Slenderman stories are also people who like jumpscares and psychological horror, and this game treads the line between those two falteringly. Chances are if you're not a Slenderfan, not influenced by jumpscares or dislike them entirely, or do not find psychological horror that frightening, you will not like this game. At all.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? Overall, yes - if you're a Slenderfan and you like jumpscares. For the Slenderfans in the audience, there is a lot of backstory there, and it being written by the same crew as Marble Hornets is sure to make you bring to mind that vlog's most famous, eeriest scenes while playing the game. For those who find the idea of being hunted and toyed with frightening, or the concepts the game is trying to get across frightening - like being trapped someplace with something dangerous, or being followed by something malicious - there's a lot to like here. However, if you just do not find Slenderman, jumpscares, or psychological horror of the kind Slendy is known for frightening, you aren't going to enjoy it, and there's little the game can do to convince you otherwise. It's kind of like a found-footage film - the way it's designed and shot is not for everyone, the way its story plays out is not for everyone, and the tropes in it are definitely not for everyone. The game is fun, and definitely a decent horror game, but it's flawed. Whether or not that flawed nature adds to its charm or chafes you to no end is a matter of opinion.","January 10, 2015","true","33.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This game will ease you in with beautiful scenery, haunting music and a tense atmosphere, then gradually lead into the paranormal investigation into where the player's friend has gone and what the thing that took her is. From suspenseful searches through abandoned locations, to shortlived breather moments, to intense chases, this game has all the elements needed to excel as a horror.\n\nThere are some downsides unfortunately. A lot of the scares are jumpscares, the enemy AI can be cheap at times and there are some bugs in need of ironing out. The main problem is the jumpscares, which there seem to be a lot of, in addition to the moments of genuine horror.\n\nIf you can forgive some of its cheap scares and fully immerse yourself in the heart-pounding experience that is Slender: The Arrival, you will have a short but altogether riveting time playing. Choose to get the terrifying experience over with as soon as you can or spend time gathering clues as to what happened - which in itself is an extremely interesting story.\n\nFor horror fans, this is perfect. You will dread continuing on, in fear of what is to come. At times there will be nothing, at others your worst suspicions will be confirmed and something horrible will come at you from the darkness. But always the game will be gripping and have a lot more to offer past the first playthrough, from extra content to undiscovered clues.","December 5, 2013","true","59.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

So that said, I was curious to give this game a go, especially since I love horror games and giving myself a good scare once in awhile. Let's just say that this game did not disappoint. Although it was a bit of a short game as I clocked in around 2.5 hours, completing it in two sessions, I've got no regrets about purchasing or playing the game. It was a good experience I enjoyed, which is what matters. And if I must say so, I was quite a fan of the soundtrack for this game, which I also purchased as well. I find it goes well with the game itself and definitely adds in that scare factor. It can also be creepy as well. I was impressed with the graphics. And controller support was a nice bonus too, as I was initially unsure if this game had it or not.  And finally, I think this game has a pretty good story as well, which is an important thing I look for when I play video games. This game definitely has my curiosity of Slender Man intrigued now as I'm pretty sure I'm going to be looking more into this Slender Man stuff more. All in all, I enjoyed this game and I'd recommend it, especially if you want a good scare. And keeping in mind, I played the entire game in a pitch dark room with headphones.","February 2, 2015","true","6.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/halferuga/recommended/252330/","halferuga","halferuga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/halferuga/","79 products in account","Slender: The Arrival utilizes two basic gameplay mechanics: "find X of Y in this level" and "avoid this monster" which worked so well in the original Slender: The Eight Pages. Unfortunately, the execution of the second mechanic falls flat compared to the free predecessor: Slenderman often chooses to aggressively teleport in front of the player instead of silently stalking him - a small detail which ruins all the suspense that defined the original. Because of this new feature and several other "this is not fair" moments, the game alternates between being cheesily scary and annoying, with the second trait being a lot more common on more challenging game difficulties.\nIt also delves into it's own vision of the Slenderman lore, working hand in hand with the previous game - which could be interesting for Slenderman enthusiasts. Game's own share of secrets and Easter Eggs also helps.\nGoing commercial certainly helped Blue Isle Studios achieve it's goals, because the game looks and sounds amazing. I have a big screenshot folder which I made during the game's initial release back in March 2013. Unfortunately, the optimization leaves much to be desired.\nOverall I recommend this game to the people who liked the original, because it's more of the same, and from purely consumer standpoint, it's really cheap. If you are unfamiliar with The Eight Pages but interested in the indie game market, I recommend you to play the original and dive straight into this.","December 1, 2013","true","4.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Kids are calling this the "scariest game evar", although since I'm over 30 I would disagree.  Truthfully, once you understand all the baddie's patterns, it's simple to avoid them.  It is a bit unnerving to see Slendy silently watching you from a distance, but if you've played any "Half-Life" games, you'll know what that's like (thanks, G-Man!  Slendy even resembles the G-Man a bit, now that I think about it..)\n\nAnyway, the game's "scare" factor is all jump-scares, which to me is a bit of a cop-out: of COURSE you're going to jump when the ambient soundtrack abruptly blasts in your earphones whenever Slendy appears.  Just to experiment, I turned the sound all the way off in my headphones and the game was 85% less scary: the tension seems to come from its soundtrack.\n\nIt's mostly a hunter-survival game with collectable elements, very similar to "Sir, You Are Being Hunted", only without a sense of humor.  Still, I enjoyed the game, it's short and entertaining and I bought it on sale for cheap.  Fun to play with a beer after a long day at work and the kids are in bed.  It's not the "scariest video game evar", though; no, for me, that would be "Shadow Man", a pc game I only play in the daytime, preferably when I'm not alone in the house.  (Sadly, I can't tell you why because I only own it on retail so I can't review it on Steam.)\n\nShort version: Slender's short and entertaining (but not for the kiddies.)

I finished it rather quickly. The prologue is good, a bit of fun and tension, generally quite enjoyable. No real threat.\n\nThe eight pages wasn't much of a challenge either, slender was around but he couldn't do much harm. It was as easy as looking the other direction.\n\nThe next part is what stopped me from loving the game really, "into the abyss". The games logic is poor at this stage, I can understand that the developers wanted to make it scary but they could have done a better job than simply making the character wander into a mine. I bought the game hoping for some gameplay invloving mostly slender, it would be hard and intense, that's what I wanted. Instead I ended up with lots of little zombie things that would run twice your speed, you couldn't beat them and only stop them from running for a bit. You couldn't hide or run away from them, this would be fine of course if the objective was "Stay Alive For 5 Minutes", instead you had to venture around the mine finding six generators. It is a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\nThe ending is extremely poor and the storyline didn't have much going for it. Sure, the game was scary and intense but it was far from what I expected.\n\nAll that aside, i'm recommending this game because it is still very good regarding the horror genre.","July 15, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The enemies you shall be running from are frightening and very well designed, each with their own unique mechanics and characteristics.\n\nSlender: The Arrival has a very simplistic story on the surface, starting with the player character, Lauren, visiting the isolated home of her friend Kate, only to find her missing and sets out in search of her. However, as the game progresses, small and even subliminal clues can reveal the nightmare fuel behind the horrors you witness.\n\nUnfortunately, the game was somewhat short upon release, but a healthy dose of extended and new levels from Blue Isle Studios certainly made up for that problem. It is still not as long as games like Outlast, but the various difficulty settings, achievements and small level of randomisation in the levels will always be alluring for those with the courage to go again.\n\nSlender: The Arrival is a worthy adaptation of the original Slender: The Eight Pages game and does an excellent job of making you feel as if Slenderman could be right behind you at any time. The tension and atmosphere are exquisite, the story is chilling and the scares are unforgettable. After all this time, I can still not get enough of this game, and can certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a good horror experience.","June 13, 2015","true","20.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You see initially i was having an enjoyable experience and wondering why this game got lower scores but now that i look back i see some of the outstanding issues. At the beginning of the game I was pretty freaked out, you know, taking my time looking around every dark corner. This was good, the opening prologue level was probably my favourite part of the experience. But after the end of this level that's when things start to fall down. Slowly as you progress through each level the fear factor actually decreases. With brighter lit enviroments as you progress the game it took away some of the worry that i had since i no longer needed to worry about what was in the dark.(BTW i love darkness in games but when you make it so dark it's impossible to navigate i have an issue) Not only does the scare factor drop with the lighting system but when i first watched the Chaser from a distance i was more laughing than scared since the animation was jerky and the AI seemed to be in a state of pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This strikes me as odd though that an enemy that you will spend a lot of time looking at has crap animation while the Slenderman(the creature you'll want to spend the least time looking at) has proper and well designed animations. The other creature, Charlie, seemed to have near-non existant animations and when he was sitting still it looked more like a something from Doom where it's a 2D images worked into a 3D enviroment.\nThe sound design feels well done with creature and enviroment noises adding to your already tense state. But i stopped for a minute when I heard the sounds from Slender: The Eight Pages. I guess it's supposed to be a callout to the last game but this is a new game and i'd like to hear improved versions of these sounds.\nSpeaking of the last game, I did enjoy the Eight Pages remake level, which did a good job of calling out to the last game while still keeping a sense of originality.\nNow here's the big one besides the ending, the glitches. Now I only had one real gamebreaking bug but in horror games even if a bug isn't game breaking it can still absolutely ruin the immersion for a player. For example, the first time I played the Eight Pages level I had 7 pages and was freaking out ,worrying about the Slenderman but then I saw him and was baffled when he was about to kill me and then just left. I didn't see him like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and walked right into him and ♥♥♥♥ all happened. And I know this isn't supposed to happen since I tested the level other times. Other Slendy bugs were dying from him even though he was nowhere to be seen, him teleporting inside other objects and a weird one where he hovered above the ground. My gamebreaking bug was when I was caught by the Chaser and waited to die but the camera just sat there fixated on the Chaser's face like it had grabbed me. After a few minutes the Chaser started running away with the camera following it's face from the front. This continued for about 7 minutes before i gave up and had to restart the level.\nWe now come to the ending. Now I feel like I could spoil the ending here and not ruin it for you at all but I won't for the sake of fanboys everywhere. What you should know is the ending is a major cliffhanger with nothing being resolved. It just kinda ends. Maybe I could have overlooked this but with the game being obnoxiously short it makes it un-compensatable. It feels like after the ending was actually once a level just a leading to the next level and they were just like, "♥♥♥♥ it we can sell it like this" and then just folded in.\n\nSo all in all,\nPROS:\n-Nicely designed enviroments\n-Atmospheric SFX and music\n-Very well directed opening\n-Small enclosed enviroments(buildings, etc...)\n-Scary and well designed creatures\n-Interesting secret level\n-Some genuinly scary moments\n\nCONS:\n-Embarrasingly short\n-Buggy creature animation\n-Poor AI\n-Massively well lit sections\n-Repetitive objectives\n-Too much audio taken from S:EP\n-Many glitches and bugs\n-The door opening mechanics\n-Extremely aggravating to get the secret level\n-Unsatisfying ending\n\nI wish there was a maybe button on Steam because that would suit this perfectly since there are good sequences but it is overall lacking so I'm afraid I can't recommend this unless it's on a decent sale.","August 26, 2014","false","3.8"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

The game previously had problems with optimization, but the Steam version seems to run far smoother.\n\nFor only 10 bucks, it's at least worth one playthrough, especially the Steam version, with achievements and bonus content. Beyond that though, I don't think I will ever play this outside of the new content added. The gameplay is rather repetitive with the Slender-Man's pop-up scares becoming less scary every time.

As with every game there is good and bad, however mostly bad for this game.\n\nFirst of all the good:\nThe game has a very good horror atmosphere and you are likely to get scared at several points throughout the game. The story was well thought out and when it's sunny in the game, the area does look beautiful. For an indie game the graphics are well done, even on the lowest settings. Also Slender isn't your only enemy too. The music also has variaty too, which is something you don't see much in games. This is where the good ends.\n\nThe bad:\nAs you can see on the "popular user-defined tags" one of them is "Walking Simulator". This describes the game pretty well in my opinion. The game also heavily relies on jump scares, which gets repetitive and you just expect it after a while. The only level which actually scared me was level 3-however you soon become aware of the tactics used by the proxy in this level (I won't reveal much more about this NPC as it will spoil the game's twist which I thought was great!). The game is also INCREDIBLY short. LIke most people, I completed it in a little over an hour on Normal mode (keep in mind I am TERRIBLE at games) however when I decided to play through the game for a second time shortly after activating the product on steam instead I did notice they added in a little extra which was great, however it didn't really do much to increase the game's length. The levels are reptitive, it's always collect or do 8 ect. ect..\n\nOverall I suggest only buying it on sale (like it is as of me writing this review- it's £1.74 right now) as it's great for a night in with friends and I do regulary make guests at my house play it and it also comes with achievments, steam trading cards and occational contests (the recent one being the Easter Egg contest) however the original price I paid to pre-order this game (which was £20 I think? Can't remember) wasn't enough, even with all the extras.\n\nWould I buy the sequel? Yes, but only if the price is reasonable and there is variaty. However Slender: The Arrival is a poor game with very little replay value and you'd probably find yourself quiting about half way through.","June 22, 2014","false","1.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I wanted to like this game. I'd always heard how supremely creepy the Slender mythos was, and I'd heard good things about the Eight Pages when it was free on the web (though I'd never played it). Alas. Yes, there are a few decent jump scares, but that's about it. Honestly, the most frightening thing about the game is how hot it makes my computer run. I couldn't focus on the prologue because I was too busy wondering if my PC was going to catch fire. In terms of gameplay, there's not much to it. You run around, pick up or turn on things, and try not to die. Funny thing about that, though. Running wears you out pretty fast, or something - I don't know. It's hard to say. You'll be trying to run away from something, and then you're not running fast anymore, and then OH GOD IT'S ON MY FACE. Retry. Retry. Retry. Since key objects are - in most cases - randomly generated around each level, all you can really do is hope they spawn close enough so that you can activate them before whatever thing is after you tries to kill you. Sound like Outlast? It's a lot like Outlast. Except you can't hide from things, and as far as I can tell, turning off your flashlight doesn't dissuade them from running over and clawing your face. Fun! Except not. Also, about that story: you are someone, apparently, wearing a hoodie and recording everything, because found footage, or whatever. And it seems you're trying to find your friend, or something, who apparently is a nut case and likes to draw with chalk on every surface for hours at a time in big scribbly letters. You get hints of something or whatever, but that's about it. Despite a decent score, and a few pretty vistas throughout, this game is really not worth the hour or two it takes to complete it.","February 27, 2014","false","2.2"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

Shame it was wasted. Slender: The Arrival is a "remake" of the original Slender game, which I found boring as hell, but tons of people praised it anyway. After it blew up, a company tried to make a Slender game, knowing it would sell. They were right about the selling. Unfortunately, there's not a lot to offer here.\n\nThe game is incredibly short, I beat it in a sitting. You basically just wander through a forest and ♥♥♥♥, and often times run away from things. The two "panic" levels included The Eight Pages, and some Generator start up thing. The Eight Pages part is your typical, lame, Slender thing where you find the pages in a poorly randomized world. It's okay, but there's not really a sense of urgency considering you can outrun him easily. The second part, the Generator section, was awful. You get chased by the human like thing who, like, chases you, sits on your face for 3 seconds, then leaves, I guess. I don't know if it was supposed to kill you, but it sure as hell didn't kill me. It's too easy and can be quickly done, first try. The rest of the game drags on in uninteresting walking phases, with a forest fire with Slendy trying to catch you. That's about it. There's a story somewhere in there, about you trying to find your friend, but it just didn't click well with me and all the Collectibles I found I immediately put them away and never looked at them.\n\nThis game could've been something. It could've been a really soild horror game. Instead, it relies on the jumpscares and the "look I'm spooky I'm gonna get you" kinda stuff. I really wish millions of stupid kids never praised the original Slender game. If you're looking for a good horror game, don't bother. The 12 year old kids might think it's scary, but in all honesty, this game didn't make me flinch. The villain is a 10 foot tall guy with no face and a suit with ♥♥♥♥ing tentacles. If you think that's scary, you need mental help.","December 29, 2013","false","1.8"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","3"

Slender: The Arrival has taken the original concept of the horror game and took a few more steps further. The jump-scares are certainly worth it, now that you actually HAVE to worry about Slender Man grabbing you with his tenticles. Not only that, our tall friend has a little companion, which adds on to your worries. You are no longer looking at a bleak forest each time you play. You have different levels you can get to, let it be finding the original 8 pages or turning on generators. The atmosphere has certainly become creepier, and I absolutely love it. Not to mention, you have a back story to this whole thing. It isn't like in 8 pages where you are sent off on a quest to find 8 drawings for the heck of it. This game has been promising from the start, and I'm certainly thrilled to have bought it.","January 1, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite an unclear story, and a slightly irritating middle section, its really a fun experience. Ultimately its our anticipation that delivers our frights. The easter egg hunt-like gameplay never gets old, as on multiple stages, your objectives are placed throughout the maps at random, and your enemies movements have no logic or pattern. There just really scary. Slender himself is a pretty creepy guy. Peering around trees and waiting behind corners, he's more of a trapper than a hunter. But then there's the proxy. The proxy shows up halfway through the game and stalks you through out an abandoned mine, and without giving anything away, he's short, fast, and kind of annoying. When being stalked by Slender, running in the opposite direction usually solves the immediate issue. But the proxy is not so easily gotton rid of. Tasked with turning on a series of generators in a maze of mine tunnels, the proxy attacks head on. One may turn and face their opponate, as he charges straight at you, and narrow their flash light beam, momentarily blinding him, giving you window to run and hide. But it doesnt really work. Doing this only buys you seconds and the proxy is quick. And if you dont have enough corners to duck around, he proceeds to tackle you to the ground and throttle you, all the while you curse at your screen in anger. But the ability to see past this minor nuesance, will reward you with better scares in the latter part of the game. The Steam ending is particularly horrifying. So check out Slender: The Arrival, and keep a change of shorts nearby.\n","March 5, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhostingGhost/recommended/252330/","GhostingGhost","Ghosting Ghost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhostingGhost/","138 products in account","Slender: The arrival is a horror game made on the Unity engine that plays around with the Slenderman myth.  If you haven't heard of Slenderman, you must have slept under a rock for a couple of years, since this baddy has been around for a while.\n\nThe game starts you off as Lauren, a normal, teen-age girl who goes to visit a friend of hers who happens to be in the middle of the woods (Who would've thought).  But, there's a certain, horrifying exception to this friendly greeting.  Slenderman wants to join the party.  Kate, your friend, has gone missing for a while, and as you uncover her secret, you regret every thought about her.\n\nFor the most part, the game is pretty terrifying.  If you've ever played a Slender game before, you'll get the basics pretty quickly, but some of the scares will probably be less effective towards you.  There are seven levels in total, including an easter egg level that messes with your head, with two more levels to be added at a later date.  Along with the similar controls, you'll find the gameplay to be also very similar to the other Slender games, which is disappointing.  I was hoping that they would add something new or have a new mechanic that's nececessary to play, but most of the levels are usually, "Collect 8 Pages", or "Close all windows and doors".  It detracts from the experience, but still keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times.\n\nSlenderman isn't the only creature that is present.  Characters such as proxies, Slenderman's slaves who were previous victims of the Slenderman, are present in some levels.  Oh, and one thing to point out.  This and Marble Hornets are NOT connected in any way!  People are confusing characters with Masky and Hoody from the youtube channel.  Even though the writers of Marble Hornets are working on this, the stories aren't tied.  Just wanted to get that out.\n\nOverall, the game is a terrifying game with some replay value as the scares are always randomized and even sometimes likes to break the fourth wall.\n\n+ Vewy Scawey\n+ Some Replay Value\n+ New levels Added Occasionally\n- Repetitive Gameplay\n\n8/10: Highly Recommended","March 13, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My only complaint is that if you don't find them in order (which will most likely happen because there is a lot) you will find your self kind of confused but it doesn't affect your progress.\n\nDespite these pros I wouldn't reccomend purchassing this game full priced due to its bare length.\n\nBut I can tell the developers did work hard to make this game. So in the end I would reccomend trying this game through a friend or getting it in a sale","July 2, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cool. If you liked the original indie game Slender. Cool.\n\nSlender The Arrival is the sequel to the massively popular indie game by Parsec Productions. Which to be honest I wasn't too in to. The main problem with this game is how repetitive it is. Almost every level is finding a certain number of items, be it pages or generators. And that's pretty bad when there are only FIVE LEVELS.\n\nThe game actually has more monsters that just Slenderman, which I commend them for. However, they are rarely seen ingame, which is slightly dissapointing. But for the levels they are on. It's a nice addition.\n\nSo, overall. Slender: The Arrival isn't the worst horror game ever made, it's got really cool visuals and a decent atmosphere. But it's not the long quality experience that I expected from the game. For the price, you won't be that dissapointed. But it could be a lot better. I would say to give it a look, and judge it for yourself.","November 26, 2013","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mine thing felt slightly out of place and a tiny bit forced (to me anyway). I ran into a couple bugs I found related to clicking letters and pausing while they were still open on the screen.

There arent many good horror games these days some examples of some good one are amnesia and outlast amongst others. This game comes at a close top. It has a good mix between tension and jump scares most are well placed and not repeating every 3 seconds. For a short game it gives you a lot of fun moments. It does have some drawbacks as the prive is too high for a game thats 2-3 hours worth of content and has no replay value. It also does come with its fair share of bugs nothing game breaking but you sometimes have to restart the game due to a missing object or getting stuck in a loading screen.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gaming5ever/recommended/252330/","gaming5ever","★ Team Magma Admin Courtney ★","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gaming5ever/","112 products in account","Slenderman games originally came to be when Mark Hadley(AKA Parsec Productions)released Slender the Eight Pages as a freeware game for Mac and PC on June 2012,and later some maps dubbed"Slenderman's Shadow"were released also as a freeware game by Marc Steene,starting on August 2012,and the games were immensely popular,prompting Mark Hadley to create a sequel,and of course Marc Steene to release more maps,which eventually got made into a full game,and the sequel by Mark Hadley(and another developer named Blue Isle Studios)was officially announced around when Slenderman's Shadow got started,August/September 2012.\n\nThe game was first released as a"beta"on February 2013 for Mac/PC,which was just the 2nd Level"The Eight Pages",and was officially fully released as a full game on March 28,2013\n\nIt also got a rerelease on Steam for Windows on October 28,2013,and later Mac and Xbox 360 versions on September 2014(which is also when the DLC stuff was added).\n\nI originally bought this game when it originally came out for Mac/PC on March 28,2013.\nThen I got the Steam version for Windows in May 2014,and still was barely scared at the game,but still really liked the game :).\nThen I bought the Mac version just recently,and after playing the 2 new DLC levels,I can say that this game is AMAZING ^_^\n\nThe basic plot(possible spoilers btw): There are these 2 sisters named Kate and Lauren(and 2 other people named CR and Charlie Matheson Jr.,that you'll find out about in detail in the 2 DLC levels). Kate keeps having visions of the Slenderman and decides to move out of her house and sell it,which prompts Lauren to investigate and visit since she's a real estate agent. Her car gets stopped by a tree,so Lauren goes to Kate's  house on foot, finding her stuff/furniture all over the place,and drawings of Slenderman all over Kate's room and on the walls. She hears Kate scream and goes out to investigate.  She finds the 8 pages in the forest and is almost kidnapped by the Slenderman and tries to escape,but blacks out.  She then flips on the 6 generators in the Kullman mine,occasionally getting caught by Kate(as a proxy,basically a servant being mind-controlled by Slenderman)and escapes on an elevator.  She finds a tape and sees that Kate was turned into a proxy by Slenderman,she then finds another tape(first DLC level),where CR is investigating what happened to Charlie and gets killed by Charlie,who was also turned into a proxy.  She then goes to the radio tower as Kate's notes instructed her,but the forest bursts into flames and Slenderman occasionally appears,trying to block Lauren's path.  She evades the Slenderman and goes into the radio tower,where she finds a tape,plays it in the camera that's sitting next to CR's charred corpse,which reveals how CR was killed(won't spoil how tho). Charlie(as a proxy)runs up to Lauren and she blacks out.  She ends up in a destroyed-looking home,and after looking at a couple of notes(from Kate I'm not sure myself),hears crying.  She goes to investigate the crying,which turns out to be Kate,and Kate kills her,and the camera shows  Lauren being dragged offscreen(by I believe Slenderman,again not sure myself),and the camera shuts off,ending the game.\n\nIn addition to the main story there's also 2 DLC levels(including the one I mentioned with CR,the other one I won't spoil),and a level called"Genesis",which is a remake of the game that started it all,The Eight Pages :)\n\nThe music is amazing,tho the game mainly relies on ambiance and atmosphere.\n\nThe characters are pretty good,and the voice acting as well(tho there's not a whole lot of actual voice acting).\n\nThe levels are really cool,tho they can get kind of repetitive with the gameplay at times I'll admit(even as a huge fan of this game)\n\nThe atmosphere is probably the best part of the game(in my opinion at least), and I can guarantee that at least 1 time you'll get scared,brave with horror games or not(in fact,I actually cried once because I was so scared xD).\n\nOverall,this game is an amazing horror game that I recommend to everyone,and I applaud Mark Hadley and Parsec Productions for making this game,and Marc Steene for making Slenderman's Shadow,seriously I do :)\n\n10/10 from me :)\nUPDATE Oct. 18,2014: Just got the game on Xbox 360\nUPDATE May 23,2015: Got a pretty much near-perfect Any% speedrun,and also a near-perfect All Levels speedrun in early Jan.(just forgot to post about it on this review)","May 3, 2014","true","50.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Beautiful graphics, great suspense building and effective jumpscares. Only downside, was very brief, could realistically finish it in 2 hours. Took me 3.6 because I'm a thorough explorer and I died a lot... first time I saw Slender I just ran right up to him to say hi... But other than that, it's much better than expected. And well worth it at the sale price of 3.99. I would place it somewhere between The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and Outlast, as far as style and gameplay. If you like either one of those, and a good jumpscare, you'll like this one. The story seemed like a prologue, so hopefully it's just The Arrival and we'll see some fully fleshed out sequels.

But unfortuantley, this game is not done right, far from it.\n\nYou're all familar with Slender right, the free horror game built with unity that was about you running away from the Slenderman, a tall white guy from Internet campfire stories, while collecting pages for some reason. It was ok I guess, despite it being the very defention of jumpscare fest, but it was atleast free. Not anymore.\n\nWith Slender: The Arrival now you can get chased by a tall white man while collecting pages. But with prettier graphics!\nThis game tries to set up a plot, starting out with you jogging threw the woods to a childhood friend's house, but when you get there she isn't there. Just a buttload of scribbles on the wall. You walk around for a while and eventually Slendypants pops his head up threw a window. Then you have to collect pages, that cause the Slenderman to attack you.\n\nFirst off, for a game that's trying so hard to set up a story, it does a pretty poor job at explaining what we're doing and why we're doing it. Why do we need these pages, what could these drawings by a 4-year old tell us, and why do we want them if they make Slendy attack you? Secondly, I don't really find Slenderman himself that scary, he's just a tall white guy to me,  so it might be  the fact that I'm also very tall and pale thats putting me off. If you were more enriched in the lore of Slenderman then I guess this could be scary. Maybe.\n\nBut thirdly, and most importantly, the gameplay is just awful. I like to judge horror games partially by how much they can hold up after all the spooks end. Game's like Amnesia and Five Night's at Freddy's I managed to like as I did find them fun to play after I stopped being scared. But Slender isn't one of those games, every single level is walking around, collecting or turning on X of a certain object, while Slenderman jumpscares you, or on one level, you get chased by a human. Rather than running away, from it, you get to stand still for a second and flash your light at it stop it from running at you.\nOver and over and over. This game was so grating and just plane boring to play  that I couldn't even bring myself to get to final level. The point where I stopped playing was when I burnt to death in a forest fire level, where slenderman appeared several times but I didn't notice because he blened in with the trees.\n\nIn conclusion, just stick with the original Slender and all it's spinoff games if you found them scary, rather then throwing 10 bucks at this and getting basically the name thing with some pretty graphics.","March 4, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is pretty great but it's criminally short with an unsatisfying ending. Personally it is pretty scary to me, I feel like anyone who wasn't scared at least once is a liar or is tough as nails. the only parts where I got stuck is the vhs part (because of the game not registering myself beating the first video) and parts where it is literally too dark to see what to do. the story itself ties in well with the first game but is also unique in its own right, slenderman is pretty spoopy especially when you're just starting to notice him in the background and he then disappears from sight. the first time he disappeared I was 100% sure he was behind me waiting for a jumpscare but strangely enough the game is pretty restrained for the first couple of minutes, it reels you in with the back-story and the mysterious disappearances. through the hidden level, it's implied that Charlie Matheson (the boy on the lost poster) is, more or less, the slenderman himself though this somewhat contradicts the optional level "memories." though this could actually imply through the ending of memories, not that he was killed by slenderman but somewhat acquired by the powers of the slenderman, it is also possible he becomes one of the proxies which could explain their ability to be seemingly everywhere and the fact that one of the proxies appears only after you pick up a train set and a rather familiar stuffed bear. That’s what makes this game interesting and fresh, not just the haunting, yet beautiful visuals, or the interesting story, or the homage’s to series like marble hornets and everyman hybrid, or even the "scary" internet slenderman, it's the amount of unanswered questions to be debated. i really hope for 10 or 15 dollars or whatever it is you give this game a spin, maybe if it's on sale and you're interested. This kind of game will simply keep you looking over your shoulders and the tree topped hills for weeks to come, looking for that mysterious, faceless man.\n\n\n\nAlso as a side note, ♥♥♥♥ that cellar and give me back my twenty dollars spooperman.","May 22","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For example the ending part where your at the tower it's pretty dark, you can't see and all the stuff like that.

What I also recommend this game for is that there is detail in characters and the terrain. But what really bugs me is the shadows. It's all block like, kind of like Minecraft. So I don't recomend putting shadows on your game because it's like putting Minecraft in Slender: The Arrival.\nThe Chaser (Kate) will chase you around the whole map in the 3rd level, you might want to watch out. Lauren is the main character of this game, she is your player. she looks for Kates strang dissaperents.

I was actually able to follow the story even with being distracted by my stream since I streamed the whole 4.2 hours I currently have on it.\n\nI was able to jump right into it and understand it and enjoy it, so that's a plus for a simple minded person like me. xD\n\nRatings:\n\nGameplay: 4/5 (I would have to say 4/5 because it was an amazing story but short lived game! I really hope that they make more since it is titled "The Arrival", but who knows! Still great gameplay though!)\n\nGraphics: 4/5 (Putting this game on top quality makes it beautiful, sometimes at night with the flashlight things look a bit funky but not enough to affect the score greatly. Slender and Charlie definitely had me running away with how good they looked.)\n\nStoryline: 5/5 (I personally really enjoyed the story and I was able to keep up with it. It immersed you in every part of the story to so you could either relive it or create it. For such a short timed game, it was definitely a good story keeping in mind it incorporates Slender.)\n\nSp00ki level: 5/5 (I'm easily scared but I would still even give it a 5/5 because Charlie is VERY spooki when you're trying to do stuff and he comes and screams in your face. Slender is a little unfair and unkind at some points, he wouldn't even square up and fight me... BUT oh well.

It is a huge improvment over the original slender game, largely for it's addition of a real story. If you take a little more time to investigate you find a much deeper story than the game appears to have, with hidden collectibles all over the maps. Another plus is the game runs well (at least I've had no problems) and the controls are easy to learn.\n\n(It's better when you play late at night, no lights, headphones on, volume max.)\n\nOverall i would give this a 7.5/10","December 29, 2014","true","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Slender: The Arrival is a basic survival horror game that relies heavily on jumpscares. But that is not a bad thing. I found myself being caught off guard at moments when I believed Slender nor his Proxies were going to show up. The way this game has impeccable and building atmosphere definitely adds to the stress and pressure the game puts out, also while increasing the creep factor. The way it has subtle story telling, and links itself in a major way to its predecessor, Slender: The Eight Pages, is amazing. I would definitely recommend this game to Slender fans and horror fanatics alike. 8.75/10","November 22, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game takes the basic gameplay mechanic from the original Slender: The Eight Pages and gives it some beautiful scenery, smooth graphics, and new environments and scenarios to make it a fresh, (and eery) new experience. The story is very cut and dry, but the lack of backstory creates a feeling of unknowing, which adds to the uneasy and creepy atmosphere. When I bought this I was expecting a slightly modified version of Slender: The Eight Pages, quite honestly, but when the screen turned bright and I was suddenly in the middle of a beautiful forest at dawn, I was slightly surprised. I was even more suprised as I suddenly realized it was dark, as I walked deeper into the forest with no flashlight. The atmoshphere this game creates right off the bat is amazing, and left me wanting to play more. I would definitely reccomend this game despite its bugs.","December 27, 2013","true","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

People have collectively created or contributed to a character of horror through the internet by way of social networks, YouTube and word-of-mouth. S:TA is the next medium in the mythos of Slender Man as it allows you to explore a world where Slender Man exists. You're objective is to uncover the story, piece it together and above all, survive!

I think that Slender: The Arrival, was a huge step forward into the horror game franchise. If you have not tried Slender The Arrival i reccomend you do asap. If your steam wallet is looking empty, there are times when you can get Slender The Arrival on sale around most of the holidays. This game is a great game for anybody that liked Slender: The Eight Pages. If you dont have the minimum system requirements and own any console like Wii u, Xbox 360, Playstation 3 then you are able to buy the game later this year. Also, if you own the oculus rift it has a setting where you are able to play using the Oculus Rift. All you have to do is type this in the console: toggle VR, when you type that then you will enable virtual reality/ Oculus Rift. This game comes out with updates that add on to the original game so that you always get a new experience. The graphics in Slender The Arrival are phenominal for a horror game too. Again if you haven't tried Slender The Arrival, i would reccoomend that you do so now.\n\n\nGame Score: 9.8 out of 10","March 26, 2014","true","14.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

This is a great follow up to the 8 pages with updated graphics and atmosphere.  Initially the game seemed to aim at a more photorealistic approach but with bugs and poor optimization.  Along followed updates to the game with better optimization but with sacrifices to the games photorealism and effects.  Hopefully another follow-up to the game will hit that mark of photorealism.  Overall the game is still great and the developers deserve recognition for putting the effort into keeping the game updated and fully supported for optimization on 3 platforms now (not many small development teams do this).","October 18, 2014","true","14.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Gameplay is generally the same as the original: roam the darkness with only a flashlight in search of varying objectives to finish the stage while evading the Slenderman in order to have a quick, exciting horror experience.\n\nThe further you progress in each stage, the more the ambience intensifies (making it constantly more unsettling :D). Progress also effects how often he will appear and try to get you via teleporting around corners/infront of you. But now the game is a little more adventure-like with stage proggresion having inbetween sections during the day where you run to the next zone "safely".\n\nThe scares are very exciting most of the time because the creepy environment sets you up with eerie sound effects and ambience, making you constantly expect him to be around each corner! However, the scares definitely rely on his instant appearances ie jumpscares. That being said, (for some players) this will make his reoccuring appearances lessen in later progression because he appears more frequently and you get more used to it.\n\nThe plot is pretty subtle and is only fully revealed through various notes you progressivley hunt for (not the objective ones) so theres a little bit of collectable finding to do as a side task for future playthroughs in order to understand the events completely. In the end I personally enjoyed it and would recommend it to those who liked the original or anyone looking for a short horror game and doesn't mind some jumpscaring :P","January 25, 2014","true","6.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Almost everything in this game pisses me off to no end, and made me angry that I wasted 10 bucks on this awful "horror" game.\n\nTHE GOOD\nThere are a few good things about this game. One is the graphics. The graphics, while unimpressive in the lower settings, looks GREAT in the higher settings. The best parts of the game were walking around in the lit areas, exploring the forest at your own pase, as slender does not appear in these sections. It is a shame that they are very short. The last thing I like is the is the very first level in kate's house. You start out in the sunset, walking to an abandoned house as the sun slowly goes down. Once you get in the house, it's pitch black. You then find a flashlight, and can explore the house as much as you like. One of the rooms is locked and once opened, causes a great scare involving the slender man watching you explore the room outside from the window. Its a very creepy opening and makes a great first impression. Shame the other levels were not like this...\n\nTHE BAD\nHere's the fun part. Lets start out with it the biggest flaw that will ruin every horror game. IT IS NOT SCARY AT ALL.all the game consists of are cheap, and I mean CHEAP jumps scares that did not startle me at all. Now let me explain something: Jump scares can be well made. If the game uses the features and mechanics found in the game to make the jump scare, it can be done extremely well. Great examples are: Resident Evil 1-4, Outlast, and SCP containment breach. This game however, does not do that and goes for the cheap jump scares found in most ♥♥♥♥ horror movies like Insidious and the new Paranormal Activity movies. Another thing I hate is the gameplay.  I could explain it to you but ill just summarize the games objectives for you. In the second level, guess what you have to do? Get 8 pages. In the third level, guess what you have to do? Turn on 6 generators in a large map. In the fourth level, guess what's next? YOU HAVE TO CLOSE 8 DOORS AND WINDOWS!!! Its just the same task over and over and got boring very quick. now lets talk about difficulty. This game is hard. But not the good kind of hard that tests your skills or anything, Im talking about INSANELY cheap deaths. There are times were a character who is not slender man (whom I cannot say the name of as that would be spoilers) chases after you and jumps on you, leaving you limping for a few seconds. But sometimes out of the blue, SHE WILL KILL YOU WHEN SHE JUMPS ON YOU! There's nothing that tells you "Hey, your going to die if you get attacked again" and  also, you do not have a certain amount of times you can be attacked, believe me, I tested it. The same applys for the slenderman himself. Sometimes he will appear and give you a chance to escape, or sometimes he will say "♥♥♥♥ it" and insta-kill you. This is extremely frustrating in the final level where he appears right in front of you, making you either barley come out alive, or escape, but to then be insta-killed by his damn tentacles. Finally, the game is very short. wanna know EXACTLY how long it took me to beat this game? 58 MINUTES. Sure, my recorded hours say 2, but that is only because I spent a hour testing the games settings to see which would run best on my laptop. While I was happy as this experience was over very fast, its bad for the people who somehow enjoy it, as there game will be over in a flash.\n\nTHE VERDICT\nThis game is honestly, the worst horror game I have ever played. Don't even buy it on sale, unless you somehow get it for free, or get it gifted from a friend,it is not worth a penny. 2.5/10 AVOID AT ALL COST!\n\nFor more reviews, go to our true reviewers group:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview\n\nI apologize for most of the poor gramar found in this review.\n\nAlso, lets face it, the only reason this game is popular is becuase that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pewdiepie lets plays the slender games 24/7.","March 10, 2014","false","2.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magiccola/recommended/252330/","magiccola","magic-cola","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magiccola/","245 products in account","Slender: The Arrival could have been something great. With a much larger dev team than the original Slender: The Eight Pages, and a story written by the creators of the wonderful Marble Hornets YouTube series, you'd think it would be pretty awesome. But unfortunately, while the graphics may be very beautiful, and while the atmosphere may at first feel very foreboding and creepy, the actual scares aren't very, well, scary. The Slender Man isn't a threat, he's an annoyance. To overcome him, you simply have to look away from him, and keep your distance. As long as you adhere to those two rules, there is NO WAY you can fail. And The Chaser isn't any better. All you have to do is simply shine your flashlight at The Chaser repeatedly to stun her, and then run away. These two characters aren't enemies, they're pests. The only things standing between you and your goal in a horror game are the antagonists. The point of a horror game is to be scary. When you can avoid your antagonists so easily, it makes the game not scary. And when your horror game isn't scary, that mean's you have completely failed. Not only are the scares lackluster, but so is the gameplay and story. The missions consist of finding eight items or activating six generators while avoiding the Slender Man or Chaser (which, like I said before, isn't very difficult), or simply walking from point A to point B. The objectives are very repetetive, and combined with the lack of tension aside from a few cheap jump scares, the missions are boring and not very fun. Slender's story fails as well because everything feels very pointless. Why is your character trying to find eight pages? Why doesn't she just turn around and leave? Why are we supposed to believe that a radio tower is a safe place aside from the fact that the game just tells us that it's safe? All of these questions (and more) are never answered. The writers of the story (Troy Wagner, Tim Sutton, and Joseph Delage) said that the development team warped and manipulated their original story which, if true, might explain the poor narrative quality. Combine the lack of scares, shallow story, repetetive gameplay with the short time it takes to complete the game (45 minutes-1 hour), and you have one huge letdown of a game.","June 23, 2014","false","3.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

(In fact, it was encountering Chapter 'Genesis' which so far has basically just been the Eight Pages level copy-pasted that spurred me to write this review)\n\n2- Slenderman himself: I know what people find scarey is subjective and one person's horror is another's comedy but it's very hard to be frightened by Slenderman abducting me and assaulting me with bad picture quality when he's done it over 50 times, the saying 'familiarity breeds contempt' comes into play here and this ties into my previous point about repetition. Dying instantly due to a shadowy figure snatching you from the aether and dragging you to parts unknown never to be seen again is terrifying, having it happen to you ad nauseam just makes the experience tedious since it translates what should be a frightening experience ("Oh my God, he's going to get me! Please don't hurt me!") into something more akin to frustration ("Great, I have to do this all over again, I give up"), the forest fire level (not a spoiler if it's in the achievements) epitomises this concept and was a point where I just gave up on the game for a while because of how annoying and tedious it was becoming.\n\nOverall, if you loved the Eight Pages or the Slenderman mythos in general (particularly Marble Hornets) then you will love this game and will enjoy it greatly for those reasons, if not or if you're unsure then this game's repetitive gameplay and design will probably turn it into a seemingly long and pointless struggle with little payoff (with the exception of one or two levels which deviate from the Eight Pages formula and are all the better for it, the reccording on the VCR being a prime example of this).\n\nIt could be fun but it's hard to give an overall reccomendation.","February 27, 2014","false","5.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You're sure to have a few jumpscares, and a bit of a challenge on hardcore mode. The game has an interesting storyline for you to unravel, but it isn't forced upon you to do so. A few drawbacks are of how short the game is, and I personally didn't find it as scary as the original Slender. Also, it just didn't seem as intense as the original. You learn your surroundings quickly, losing the feeling of being lost... which is key for a Slender game.

Gamers will experience what true psychological horror is like when they play this game. The game itself will not let you keep thinking about it, it's the origins that will letyou think about it. Slenderman is a very popular mythos spread across the web, especially on some well-known forums, such as Creepypasta and many others. This game, however, completes it by making it a chilling experience to finally complete the Slender sage. What's more is that the slender saga is not even completed yet. They say there's about to be the sequel to this soon. Anyway, they added more content to the levels, in order to make the experience even more epic. I really recommend this game to many people, especially horror fans.

With a much larger dev team than the original Slender: The Eight Pages, and a story written by the creators of the wonderful Marble Hornets YouTube series, you'd think it would be pretty awesome. But unfortunately, while the graphics may be very beautiful, and while the atmosphere may at first feel very foreboding and creepy, the actual scares aren't very, well, scary. The Slender Man isn't a threat, he's an annoyance. To overcome him, you simply have to look away from him, and keep your distance. As long as you adhere to those two rules, there is NO WAY you can fail. And The Chaser isn't any better. All you have to do is simply shine your flashlight at The Chaser repeatedly to stun her, and then run away. These two characters aren't enemies, they're pests. The only things standing between you and your goal in a horror game are the antagonists. The point of a horror game is to be scary. When you can avoid your antagonists so easily, it makes the game not scary. And when your horror game isn't scary, that mean's you have completely failed. Not only are the scares lackluster, but so is the gameplay and story. The missions consist of finding eight items or activating six generators while avoiding the Slender Man or Chaser (which, like I said before, isn't very difficult), or simply walking from point A to point B. The objectives are very repetetive, and combined with the lack of tension aside from a few cheap jump scares, the missions are boring and not very fun. Slender's story fails as well because everything feels very pointless. Why is your character trying to find eight pages? Why doesn't she just turn around and leave? Why are we supposed to believe that a radio tower is a safe place aside from the fact that the game just tells us that it's safe? All of these questions (and more) are never answered. The writers of the story (Troy Wagner, Tim Sutton, and Joseph Delage) said that the development team warped and manipulated their original story which, if true, might explain the poor narrative quality. Combine the lack of scares, shallow story, repetetive gameplay with the short time it takes to complete the game (45 minutes-1 hour), and you have one huge letdown of a game.","June 23, 2014","false","3.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

(In fact, it was encountering Chapter 'Genesis' which so far has basically just been the Eight Pages level copy-pasted that spurred me to write this review)\n\n2- Slenderman himself: I know what people find scarey is subjective and one person's horror is another's comedy but it's very hard to be frightened by Slenderman abducting me and assaulting me with bad picture quality when he's done it over 50 times, the saying 'familiarity breeds contempt' comes into play here and this ties into my previous point about repetition. Dying instantly due to a shadowy figure snatching you from the aether and dragging you to parts unknown never to be seen again is terrifying, having it happen to you ad nauseam just makes the experience tedious since it translates what should be a frightening experience ("Oh my God, he's going to get me! Please don't hurt me!") into something more akin to frustration ("Great, I have to do this all over again, I give up"), the forest fire level (not a spoiler if it's in the achievements) epitomises this concept and was a point where I just gave up on the game for a while because of how annoying and tedious it was becoming.\n\nOverall, if you loved the Eight Pages or the Slenderman mythos in general (particularly Marble Hornets) then you will love this game and will enjoy it greatly for those reasons, if not or if you're unsure then this game's repetitive gameplay and design will probably turn it into a seemingly long and pointless struggle with little payoff (with the exception of one or two levels which deviate from the Eight Pages formula and are all the better for it, the reccording on the VCR being a prime example of this).\n\nIt could be fun but it's hard to give an overall reccomendation.","February 27, 2014","false","5.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You can easily break Slendy. He will rarely ever appear in front of you. All you need to do is walk straight and only look back a couple of times. I spent 40 minutes walking around the 8 pages level searching for the last page, with Slendy behind me. Not once did I feel scared and when he appeared in front, i just turned around and said nope.avi.\n\nGranted, the abandoned mine was compensation.

Factor that in when deciding if the price is worth it.\n\nHaving said that, this is a disturbing little jaunt into the Slender Man nightmare. The creators deserve a pat on the back for making such a picturesque and harrowing atmosphere.\n\nGameplay is extremely straight forward: explore, read letters, do a certain thing a certain number of times, and (most important of all) RUN AWAY.\n\nI would love to see more of the same, except this time with a decent budget and a better variety of tasks. Puzzles, riddles, maybe a little combat with 'infected' people.\n\nAll in all, this is worth throwing a few quid at. Play it in the dark with head phones on.\nTimes I shrieked or squealed (rough estimate): 10.","June 26, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The game is actually quite scary, mostly jump scares but the atmosphere is really good too. The sound can be set to surround by many of the ambient sounds like the wind dont come from the rear channels, and so the surround sound is a bit lousy. The graphics are surprising realisitic. The atmosphere of the game is what makes it really good and the lurking enemies can be quite a challenge. i had to set it to easy to make it through getting the eight pages. Finished the game in one day, but it wasnt bad for a low priced game. Not much replayability but good once through.

I was looking for the next video to put on Youtube and went with something scary. Slender: The 8 Pages was the start to a new genre of horror. This is an awesome upgrade from the original. After replaying it some, I see some things have changed for the better (last I played, the gate behind the house was a loading scene to the first level.) The levels vary in scenery, but hold the same basic idea. Collect a few items/ do a few things to get to the end of the level and progress on.\n\nThis is a great step up from Slender: The 8 Pages. I recommend it if you somehow haven't played it or even if it has been as long of a time as it was for me.","December 29, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are only ten levels which are not worth it. It has a good story line and a terrifying experience. I personally think a little more levels could've been this price. But ten dollars for ten levels isn't worth it. That is my opinion. But hey, spending more then one hundred dollars on TF2 might be too ridiculous. But still almost half of them are short levels. I think this is a little overpriced. Good graphics though. If I were you, I would wait for another steam sale come up using this game.","December 19, 2015","false","4.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hopesick/recommended/252330/","hopesick","Hopesick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hopesick/","181 products in account","There's a common complaint among fans of horror video games that very few of the titles in the genre have any real subtlety anymore. It's hard not to agree after having played such games as Dead Space or any recent Silent Hill game. Slender: The Arrival at least attemps to reverse that trend by waiting until around the twenty-minute mark to actually show the eponymous character on screen. Even so, The Arrival is little more than an amalgamation of boring horror cliches that do very little to actually frighten the player once they've figured out the game's basic mechanics.\n\nThe main premise of Slender is that you are a guy... or a girl... looking for someone named Katie. It's not exactly very big on the details, and I guess the developers wanted to leave those up to the player so that they wouldn't have to go through the trouble of writing an actual plot. The player spends most of the game wandering through a forest that's roughtly the size of an average high school auditorium looking for "clues" that look more like the drawings of a troubled 9-year-old who thinks he's "so hardcore". All the while being pursued by some faceless guy in a suit that was likely ripped off from Agent 47.\n\nLet me step away from the idiotic premise for a moment, so that I can harp on how technically unimpressive the game is. Notwithstanding the fact that it's only $3 on sale (honestly, it's not even worth that much). The Arrival looks like just another generic "indie" game that was developed by a team of college kids in their mothers' basement. The lighting is godawful; the player's flashlight is the only light source that actually illuminates the surrounding area. Aside from the player character's head bobbing back and forth, there is no animation to speak of. Slenderman appears out of view and causes some cheap distortion in the player's view. That's it. Nothing else. Even the game's indie credentials don't absolve it from the fact that it was obviously developed on a shoestring budget by a bunch of people who have no idea what they're doing. The "soundtrack" consists of a handful of boring ambient tracks that try desperately to create a tense and oppressive atmosphere, but manage to fail at both, only serving to exacerbate just how boring the game actually is.\n\nAside from all of that, between the bad lighting, poor level design, and sparse information, the game's main objective is too difficult, and the game itself too uninteresting to inspire the player to rise to the challenge. If you have a friend or family member who is into Slenderman and also under the age of twelve, this might be a worthwhile purchase. Otherwise, don't even bother, just stick to Marble Hornets.","December 25, 2014","false","0.7"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","10","21","4","0"

You can only do it from the tiny launch box that appears as soon as you start to load into it.\n\nThe game does not work well with virtual game controllers, supposedly, unsure if true game controllers will work it. I have no game controllers - however all my character did for two days straight was spin in aimless circles and was unmovable.\n\nIf you want some mediocre horror; this is for you.

Maybe they are trying to make it really look like you are viewing it through an old cam corder, but still it's annoying and detracts from the graphics quality of the game.\n\nGameplay wise it's kind of spooky, although too dark in some places and easy to get lost or turned around. Since there are very few landmarks I ended up back-tracking for a while before realizing I was going the wrong way.\n\nThe atmosphere is kind of creepy, and the first time I saw slender it kind of spooked me because I wasn't expecting it.  Also there were a few other decent jump scares. Other than that, Meh.\n\nAlthough I did buy this on sale for $2.50, and I already had $2.22 in my account from selling trading cards.

It has a few good scares and the whole concept of a supernatural entity stalking you is very interesting, however, game lacks depth. There are also some irritating difficulty spikes and the game is simply unfair in some instances. Few levels are memorable and to the game credit creepy as hell, unfortunately tyhe game seems a little bit too short and extra content is nowhere to be seen so far.\n\nOverall Slender the Arrival is a mediocre game, which relies too much on oversimplified game mechanics combined with creepy atmosphere.

With players viewing the action through Lauren's video camera, the game is at first deeply atmospheric but flaws that hinder the experience soon become apparent.\n\nThe majority of Slender: The Arrival involves the player walking through dark, open environments where the Slender Man can appear from anywhere. On a first playthrough, Slender: The Arrival is very tense, with each step forward making the player feel uneasy. The overall atmosphere is bleak with finely presented environments, eerie music and collectible notes helping construct an unsettling experience. Players familiar with Slender Man lore will undoubtedly find the experience more unnerving than those who are not.\n\nDespite the rich atmosphere and tangible tension, Slender: The Arrival turns into a trivial, almost dull game once the Slender Man actually appears. The first time a player observes the Slender Man, their inital response is most likely one of fright. However, each time the Slender Man appears on screen, the frightning effect is diminished. Players will soon realise that the game consists of a foe that can teleport around the environment to provide cheap jump scares and little more. It soon becomes tedious and if one were to turn around and see the Slender Man merely floating toward them as if it were on a wire, it all becomes easily managable.\n\nSlender: The Arrival is good during the first hour but it soon becomes a tedious collection of jump scares which fail to fright and interactions with a folkloreish entity that strips away all creditable mystery or menace. Even harder difficulty settings fail to improve the frights in a lacklustre horror experience.","August 20, 2014","false","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The reason I put the words "few scared" in inverted commas is because they were just cheap jumpscares which could make anyone shocked and that is the main problem with the game; its just jumpscare after jumpscare, it gets a bit tiring after the "long" period the game lasts for. Yet again, I put "long" in inverted commas because its just too short of a game to be worth anybodies money - possibly worth getting if it was on sale for like 2 dollars but if not, I would avoid this game.

Thankfully, my code worked for Steam, so now I am fine. Let's begin.... This is the BEST Slenderman game on the market.\n\nSeriously, it is the best Slenderman game. It borrows a lot from Marble Hornets, which is what really made mythos. Heck, it's even written by Troy, Tim, and Josh. Before I go on any further, if you didn't like Eight Pages, you will not like this. If you liked Amnesia, you will like this. Now, as for the game....\n\nHunt for items while Slenderman hunts you down. In one later mission, he has a Proxy helping him which ADDS to the already stressful nature of the game. It's randomly generated, which makes looking fun! The Slenderman himself appears tall, imposing, and the sound effects + camera static REALLY makes him feel terrifying. In fact, everything about the visual appearance of the Slenderman in Arrival is perfect.\n\nThe game IS short, though, and a bit repititve.

It was a fresh idea, but it wasn't exactly compelling or fleshed-out enough to warrant spending any more than 30 minutes to an hour with it.\n\nSlender: The Arrival aims to lenghten, and provide greater context to the original idea, but it hardly manages to do either successfully.\n\nThe story is presented to the player through signs and notes that are scattered around each environment in the game, and its your job to collect them and determine what happened in Slenderman Land. Who (or what) is Slenderman? What happened to the family who lived there? Who are they, and why is Slenderman targeting them? The game definitely raises more questions than it answers, so be prepared for dissapointment if you were expecting a decent payoff. Even if you do manage to piece it together, the story is textbook horror, and it doesn't offer any significant surprises or revelations.\n\nThe game is dissapointingly short as well, clocking in at 2 hours or less on normal difficulty, depending on how often you need to retry the difficult sections of the game.\n\nIf you go into to Slenderman: The Arrival with low expectations, you might find it enjoyable. The visuals look nice, and the audio design is suitably creepy when it needs to be. In all honesty, it's impressive when you consider that this is Blue Isle Stuidio's first game, but at the end of the day though, Slenderman: The Arrival is undone by its cryptic storytelling and ridiculously short length. I'd only recommend that you pick it up when it goes on sale.\n\n","January 10, 2015","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In case you feel like you would miss out on that eight pages experience, there is no need to worry because they have that too. I strongly recommend buying this game for any horror game. Even though on my windows 8 it was a little laggy. It made the experience even more fun and even more scary.","May 14, 2014","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omnike/recommended/252330/","omnike","Tyler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omnike/","177 products in account","As a large fan of horror games, I have a huge problem with them. Most horror games rely on the initial shock of whatever it is you're dealing with. In this case, the whatever it is you're dealing with is Slender Man. He's creepy and extremely startling. He'll scare you to death the first run through this game. Slender, or better yet the mechanics that make up Slender, rely on the unknown and the confusion that's conjured in your own head. Being lost AND hunted make for a stressful situation. And they only lay it on thicker as you continue. But after the first playthrough, you know exactly what to expect and you know exactly how Slender and his hooded companion are going to react to you and your actions. The shock wears off and you're left only a little startled every time your camera lense gets a bit of static. All of that boils down to the lack of any real replayability. Nothing is left to keep you wondering except a few collectables. If you are looking for story in this game, almost the entire narrative is found within the many collectables found in the game. The collectables and the narrative found within those collectables adds a very miniscule amount of replayability. Which brings me to my conclusion; I think this game is very worthy of its $9.99 price tag, but doesn't have much more to offer after the experience.","February 1, 2014","true","19.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was surprised at first, but the novelty is short-lived as the gameplay dries up along with the backdrop provided. It's what some may expect from a slender game, but I believe the last couple levels are an utter waste of time. It's not too expensive, so dig in as long you like the same old plate with better visuals.","January 2, 2014","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Anyway, you decide to go out venturing into the woods, its day-time, so you don't encounter the Slender Man. Once you get to Kate's house, its already dark, and you go inside. The first thing you see when inside is a huge drawing on the wall, the drawing consists of trees, and Slender Man. You have to find a flashlight, and its usually in the Dining Room, but it can sometimes be found in the Living Room or the... Lounge..? I don't know what to call it, but by that time you can see the Slender Man, but he only appears outside. You find a key in a bedroom upstairs, and you must go down a dark hallway to get to the room that the key opens. Once inside, you see basically a mural to the Slender Man, there are little notes on the wall and everything. There is a desk with a page on it that says "To the woods", and after you pick it up, you here a woman scream at the top of her lungs, presumably Kate. You head outside and go to the back gate, where you then actually start the game. There are 6 chapters all together, Prolugue, The Eight Pages, Into The Abyss, The Flashback, The Arrival, and a secret level called Genesis.\n\nScare Factor: 7.5/10\nStory: 6/10\nGameplay: 8.5/10\nOverall Rating: 9/10\nThats just my opinion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drdoctor13/recommended/252330/","drdoctor13","Dr. Doctor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drdoctor13/","165 products in account","PROS:\n-The best looking Slender game to date\n-Written by the cast of Marble Hornets, the most popular and longest-running Slenderman ARG.\n-Includes more characters and a large overarching story that is slowly told through the collectibles found in-game.\n-Devs have a unique sense of humor.\n-Fantastic atmosphere.\n-Includes an HD remake of the original game and a secret level.\n\nCONS:\n-Glitches everywhere: The Chaser can grab you from five feet away (while stunned), and falling out of the level warrants an insta-death and Slendy breaking the fourth wall, removing the immersion of the game.\n-The game's secret level includes "dialouge" between the player and Slenderman, but there is no voice acting. It's all words on the screen.\n-The player switches between two or three different characters throughout the course of the entire game. You don't really know which one you're playing unless you've paid attention (especially in the secret level).\n-The Chaser's identity is not revealed until the end of the game, and the identity of the monster that kidnaps you (Charlie Matheson Jr. from the posters) is not revealed ever.\n-The Chaser is not a threatening enemy, if you know what you're doing. She's just tedious and annoying.\n-The Hardcore Ending is a complete rip-off.\n-The flashlight and key in the prologue are in different places in the beginning of the game every time. Sometimes, I couldn't find one or the other.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nThe game has it's flaws, but is all around an acceptable horror game, and I would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys a good atmospheric horror. The game legitamately scared me at a few points and has a fantastic story written by Marble Hornets, it just underdelivers in the presentation.\n\n","June 25, 2014","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Thankfully, my code worked for Steam, so now I am fine. Let's begin.... This is the BEST Slenderman game on the market.\n\nSeriously, it is the best Slenderman game. It borrows a lot from Marble Hornets, which is what really made mythos. Heck, it's even written by Troy, Tim, and Josh. Before I go on any further, if you didn't like Eight Pages, you will not like this. If you liked Amnesia, you will like this. Now, as for the game....\n\nHunt for items while Slenderman hunts you down. In one later mission, he has a Proxy helping him which ADDS to the already stressful nature of the game. It's randomly generated, which makes looking fun! The Slenderman himself appears tall, imposing, and the sound effects + camera static REALLY makes him feel terrifying. In fact, everything about the visual appearance of the Slenderman in Arrival is perfect.\n\nThe game IS short, though, and a bit repititve. For $10, you'll get what you paid for.","November 1, 2013","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omnike/recommended/252330/","omnike","Tyler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omnike/","177 products in account","As a large fan of horror games, I have a huge problem with them. Most horror games rely on the initial shock of whatever it is you're dealing with. In this case, the whatever it is you're dealing with is Slender Man. He's creepy and extremely startling. He'll scare you to death the first run through this game. Slender, or better yet the mechanics that make up Slender, rely on the unknown and the confusion that's conjured in your own head. Being lost AND hunted make for a stressful situation. And they only lay it on thicker as you continue. But after the first playthrough, you know exactly what to expect and you know exactly how Slender and his hooded companion are going to react to you and your actions. The shock wears off and you're left only a little startled every time your camera lense gets a bit of static. All of that boils down to the lack of any real replayability. Nothing is left to keep you wondering except a few collectables. If you are looking for story in this game, almost the entire narrative is found within the many collectables found in the game. The collectables and the narrative found within those collectables adds a very miniscule amount of replayability. Which brings me to my conclusion; I think this game is very worthy of its $9.99 price tag, but doesn't have much more to offer after the experience.","February 1, 2014","true","19.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I played on "easy," because I wanted to experience the game settings and "mythos" elements. I found it to be very atmospheric, creepy, and surprisingly pretty.

There is a common thread running through the levels which is supported by documents and a couple of clever flash-back mechanisms, but the story is definitely not well fleshed out. If it had been, and if the game had been longer, it would have been gold.\n\nAs it stands, if you like Slenderman stuff, or if you just like creepy, atmospheric games, this is a good one, I would catch it on sale because its very short, but in general its worth a shot.\n\nI am currently playing through it a second time on "normal," because a little more challenge would be nice, and because I failed to get all of the documents the first time through. So, it also has replay value, which is nice, especially in a short game.\n\nI should also mention that I happily had no technical issues with this game, which is rare enough these days, It seems to be solidly made by people who were interested in their subject matter.

And also really scared. So being the typical consumer that I like to think I am, I bought this game before it came to everyone's beloved platform, Steam. Let me say one thing: It has come so far from then.\n\nNew levels, bug fixes, level edits. The list goes on. All of these things have made the game a more enjoyable experience for players like me. It is not comparable to something like Outlast, at least for me, due to the factors of human nature brought up in that game (humans have the capabilities to be far more monstrous than any supernatural beings, in my humble opinion). However, the game is still terrifying. And short. I am saddened to say that I think my time playing may have been my whole playthrough. Not on hardcore, but on regualr mode. That said I had played through the game before, so much of it was already known to me.\n\nAll in all, a top-notch Slenderman game. As a horror game, probably around the middle to upper-middle class, the kind that still would have qualified for the guillotine in the French Revolution but only by the length of their necks. As a story, its a bit weak. Gameplay is your typical run and hide without the hiding and with a lot more of the running. I would recommend getting it on sale, probably for $5, although I could still recommend it at $7.50.","November 1, 2014","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Они запихали туда режимы сложности, это влияет на поведение монстряков. не совсем понятные задания, иногда можешь не понять чего хочет от тебя игра(1 глава).\nВывод: Если играть на "Normal"  или "???" игра становиться в разы страшнее.

No. It is worth $9.99? Absolutely Not.\n\nI picked this game up on sale for $0.19 and even then I can't recommend this game.\n\nThe first few moments of the game, I thought this seems mysterious and interesting. Unfortunately five minutes later, it was not. You discover the plot that your friend Kate went missing and want to find out what happened to her. Except I did not want or care to find out what happened to her. There was later a flashback but that didn't even make me want to care about to Kate.\n\nI played through this game and it doesn't get any better. It's very repetitive and boring. You walk around and try to avoid the slenderman, who is not scary at all, and attempt to find various objects. There is no combat and the world isn't even explorable...it's a linear game.\n\nUnfortunately the steam community tries to hype up horrible games and give them good reviews. Please don't buy this game, it only encourages more terrible games to be made.","November 11, 2015","false","4.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

It's easily the scariest game I've ever seen.\n\nYou play as Lauren, a moderately normal woman who has the worst luck this side of breaking a mirror when her car crashes into a recently felled tree. From there, she has to walk - by the time she arrives at her friend's house, Kate has disappeared. After a while, she unlocks the door to her friend's house, to find the walls covered with notes.\n\nShe hears Kate scream, and runs out the back door. Eventually, she finds a journal, filled with ramblings about a man named 'C.R..'\n\nIt has a story made by the people who made Marble Hornets, the web series that inspired the original Slender, and the graphics are beautiful and terrifying, depending on where you are. Maybe even both. The jump-scares were enough to make me nearly ♥♥♥♥ myself at several points, and the final level is just creepy as all hell, so... do I recommend it? Hell, yes I recommend it!\n\nLook, just... buy the game. You know you want it.","December 26, 2013","true","14.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I had the chicken skin going and everything.\n\nBut as  a gamer with ADHD, this really is a challenge.\n\nIt should feature a god dam RUN button.. Walking is really time consuming and I find that I was losing attention quickly.\nEspeciall when you die and restart. That is just torture in itself.\n\nBut the run feature as well to avoid confrontations. Seriously, in real life, one would run away from danger. But this character when you confront danger, you still just "walk away" like tomorrow is another day.\n\nAs for defence... Well there is nothing you can do, you get attacked and you are dead. Simple.\n\nWould be cool to have something. This would probably be a better game as a fps game.\n\nI know that it's not designed to be that way. Just a suggestion or a mod added to it would make this more fun to play like Alien VS Predator 2...\n\nAlso, achievements. Gaming companies need to stop making achivements like completed NIGHTMARE level. Not everyone can do it and don't want to do it. The fact that you finish the (any) game is and achievement. Sometimes, a person wants to play the game once and that's it they move on. Achievements like this is just making people play the game again for nothing on a level they don't want.\n\nAlso achievements where you need to see how you die, or fail x amount of times and what not. That is really annoying. It seems they lacked imagination and focused on how to get achievements for playing bad instead of playing well.\n\n\nAlthough these are what I believe would make it a better game, it is designed for what it is and if you have the patience for it then this game is good for a good scare.","August 17, 2015","true","5.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

First off, the new levels are TERRIFYING. And I mean Amnesia terrifying, Homestead and Memories (the two new levels) are very memorable and are a great addition to the game. The Arrival looked amazing upon release, and yet v2.0 makes it look even better. There are better textures and models in some areas, and Genesis now looks fantastic rather than being a carbon copy of The Eight Pages with some of The Arrival's entities. The biggest flaw to S:TA before v2.0 was the gameplay; it was ridden by bugs and problems such as the overly frustrating mine level, terrible interaction physics, and the simply god awful fire sequence. Everything has been fixed in 2.0. The interaction is now smooth and comfortable, the mine level's main NPC (the source of the frustration) has been perfected, and the fire sequence is now an intense but fair climax.\n\nSome gamers may be turned off by the ten dollar price tag for a 3 hour game, but guys, come on. A group of inexperienced indie developers worked their asses off for this and they deserve the money. Not to mention, this is one of the horror greats in gaming - I liked it almost as much as the Amnesia games.

You have nowhere to go, you can run, scream, and hide. But None of that will help you. You WILL not be brave in this. Your only survival is fear. You know you are going to die, He is everything. He Is Everywhere. You can't do anything but just run. This game is a perfect game to make you feel real fear, real challange. You know what to do, But you can't. Out of pure fear....

I can't bring myself to play past the forrest. It's dark, the heartbeat rythm going on and the thought that the Slender Man may be rite there on the next turn while you're trying to find all 8 pieces of the letter or whatever it is that was left behind. It gives me the full bodies chills. From either the point that it's that creepy or the fact that I know that the paranormal is there and it does happen and based on personal experiences with the paranormal. Umm. I'll try to get through it but I need a couple boxes of Scooby Snacks to help me along for courage to do so. If I could rate this game with a star system I would say that it far surpased stars to the point of being Super Nova. If you like being freaked out, creeped out, or just to have the feeling of your blood running cold then you need to get this one.

If you pick up a document, the game tells you that it can always be viewed from the Main Menu. However, this resets your game and in case you were in the middle of a chapter, you have to start all over again. Chapters aren't overly long, so it's not a big loss, but it's still tedious and annoying. Though the documents aren't needed after reading them up once, they are in every other game similar to this, thus most players will fall for this trap due to natural player instinct.\nAnother issue I must address is the running. It's way too slow. When you wanna run away or just get somewhere fast, and you aren't sure if your character is walking or running, something is wrong indeed. I never actually figured out if there was a hidden stamina meter, or if the running was just bugged, but at times it seemed to slow down really badly, and it can get pretty annoying pretty fast. Especially in those scenes where a player's natural instict is to run, it doesn't really add to the feeling that you feel like a flea in a tarpuddle.\n\nBut is Slender: The Arrival a bad game then? Absolutely not. And to its credit, I must say that the parts that are meant to be scary really work! This game manages to create a frightening and eerie mood without relying solely on jumpscares like so many other horror games do. Plus the game randomizes certain elements (such as the locations of key items), so that there is at least something new on each playthrough. I wouldn't necessarily pay 10€ from it, but it's definately worth to try for a horror game fan.\n\nI do recommend this game to any horror game fan, but with a little bit of caution =) The menu "trap" becomes a neglectable issue once you know it, and despite the running being very boring at times, it doesn't ruin the game. But they are still there. But all and all, this game has potential, and the Devs should be given credit for it =)","December 9, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The settings are all very similar, and the camera overlay was a nice touch.\n\nIt has a good atmosphere, with creepy sound cues and lighting. This could have been improved with more buildup of tension as seen in amnesia and in the slender vlogs, where you anticipate that something will happen around every corner. Still, the environments are well designed, and the graphics are very good, including shadows, hdr and a nice touch of colour distortion from slendy at various points in the game. The game also runs very smoothly, unlike the first game (8 pages) which had serious fps issues.\n\nThe jump scares are fantastic, and really make the game. To see slendy in front of you and then turn around to find him behind you is terrifying, and is a good change from other horror games where you can just lock the door and know that you will be alerted to the monsters arrival when he tries to break it down.\n\nThe proxy is a questionable addition in my opinion, and not well designed. While its good to have another enemy to run from, there seems to be no way of getting rid of her or to combat her. She will just stand there indefinetley when you point the torch at her, and when you runaway, she will suddenly appear out of nowhere behind you and kill you. Initially she is scary, but after the 5th time she gets you in a few minutes, she becomes more of an annoying obstacle than a terrifying monster.\n\nOverall, while the game does have its faults, it is still a fantastic horror game, and also a must have for any fan of the slenderman mythos and videos.","January 16, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a very nonintuitive game. It's standard first person shooter controls (without the shooter) and places you in the creepy woods of a park. One of its main shortcomings is that it lacks the ability to deliver the story properly. We are supposed to make assumptions about everything. Assumptions that are probably wrong. I kept finding clues about a person and assumed that person might be me. Then it took reading some backstory in a walkthru to discover that I was a completely different person baguely mentioned in one of the notes. The first few times I played it I was throughly creeped out and some of the presentation helped with that. It uses a method of "steady-cam" view that looks like you are filming this which can also be viewed that you are someone else watching this person's footage (a la Blair Witch Project, CLoverfield, or Paranormal Activity). What you find does heighten the tension and when odd things are seen it really creeps you out. But then it feels like a grind. Where am I supposed to go next you ask. Oh over there. Wait I think I've found everything. Do I go back? Where to next? There is a decisivve lack of direction and instruction. It gave me a goal but the goal was so vague that I didn't know whether I was finished nor did I know if I was finding the right things. I wandered around doing nothing SLOWLY for a half hour and then quit the game. Why? HEre is the biggeswt problem. There is no save feature. It saves once you finish "THE CHAPTER". I was stuck in the "prologue" for days. Every time I tried it I had to start from the beginning. So by the 15th time I tried finding all the clues or whatever I was not afraid of the woods nor the creepy things. So far all I've seen are creepy things but none of them are harmful things. Don't get me wrong. This game has figured out that in horror you can't just in-your-face all the horror like Dead Space or Doom 3 etc. But it has to be subtle. But it hasn't fuguyred out pacing, story, furthering the adventure. It also relies a lot on camera glitches and sound effects and music. THose things are very important in horror. But in this case I am never sure if these elements actually appear in the game world or just in the game "providing atmosphere" like I'm being followed around by a 40s radio SFX guy banging pots together and breathing heavily. It reminds me of the scares in the movie The Ring where Ehren Krueger hit us over the head with loud noises and in your face weird cut in pictures to scare us and when you got to the end all you could say was "Huh?"\nI would be interested if this studio tried it again with horror as this was an improvement over its predecessor but it still isn't there. The controls and gameplay are still lacking. Your RUNNING mode isn't much faster than your WALKING mode. You can neither jump nor go in water so you feel like a child in one of those wheelie guides. The story needs a bit of polish. There needs to be a definite indication who I am and what I'm doing and how far I've gotten with it. Because leaving it up to my imagination is unacceptable in a game. How am _I_ supposed to know when I am done with a chapter if I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for, etc.\nThis will keep you entertained for a couple playthroughs until you give up and look through the readthroughs. (which don't really help as the items keep moving around) You want to get really scared, go for Five Nights at Freddy's.","January 5, 2015","false","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

(even when you tell yourself "it's gonna happen soon..." Slender never fails to make your heart stop for a second... which may or may not be accompanied by a scream or constipated facial expression and noise. <in my case, I 'effed up my knee with my desk>) Plus he does it randomly and differently in each game!! I mean, there's an achievement for getting insta-killed for crap's sake!!\n\nEIGHT: Slender's slightly new look and his new friends are fun, annoying and freaky to mess with and run from.\n\nand NINE:  UPDATE ALERT!! They updated the game and now it's a helluva lot harder and they added three more chapters and a secret level!  What gets better than that!! (certainly not the Chaser AND Slendy chasing you all in one level... right? and yes that ♥♥♥♥ happens and it hard as f**k to beat now without freakin' dying.)\n\nSo yeah, I probably have other reasons but I cant think of them right now.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who finds what I mentioned above appealing to their gaming standards.  Now of course, the game itself is pretty short and if you don't like horror games that rely simply on jump-scares to get your blood pumping then don't get this.  Also, this sequel game also tried to incorporate a story in it and to my standards I think the developers did a pretty decent job.  I'm not one of those gamers who gets all worked up about the overall plot and story of games simply because I'm more of an "in the moment" type.  Despite this, the game story does make sense (you have to really pay attention to all the in game clues and hints to figure out the "origin" story of Slender, it's like a really complicated mystery almost) and it helps the gameplay move along, but of course, there are some flaws (gaps almost- but since the update, that now seems to be because they left room to add things) so if you're a picky eater about that then this isn't the game for you. Now for everyone else who still isn't sure, just check out YouTube... you can get a pretty good idea of what the game is like just from watching well-known gaming YouTubers posting their gameplay and reactions on their channels (...plus half of them are really funny to watch).\n\nOverall, though... buy it and have a freaky time! :D","June 5, 2014","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(I felt this was the scariest part, if not the best part of the game)\nNow for the bad things:\n-You had Marble Hornets people on this project (No, this isn't even that bad, but I expected there to be Kate as a proxy, which was sort of a buzzkill.)\n-Obviously we get to play as CR, but my question remains WHO THE HELL IS CR?! All you've given us is the level "Homestead".\n-Hardcore mode.\n-We saw Kate as a normal human, but what the hell made her shorter, and more flexable? Did Slenderman have s*x with her?\nOverview:\nVery good game to play in the dark if you want to get scared, and also a wonderful game to explore around. 8.7 out of 10.

(even when you tell yourself "it's gonna happen soon..." Slender never fails to make your heart stop for a second... which may or may not be accompanied by a scream or constipated facial expression and noise. <in my case, I 'effed up my knee with my desk>) Plus he does it randomly and differently in each game!! I mean, there's an achievement for getting insta-killed for crap's sake!!\n\nEIGHT: Slender's slightly new look and his new friends are fun, annoying and freaky to mess with and run from.\n\nand NINE:  UPDATE ALERT!! They updated the game and now it's a helluva lot harder and they added three more chapters and a secret level!  What gets better than that!! (certainly not the Chaser AND Slendy chasing you all in one level... right? and yes that ♥♥♥♥ happens and it hard as f**k to beat now without freakin' dying.)\n\nSo yeah, I probably have other reasons but I cant think of them right now.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who finds what I mentioned above appealing to their gaming standards.  Now of course, the game itself is pretty short and if you don't like horror games that rely simply on jump-scares to get your blood pumping then don't get this.  Also, this sequel game also tried to incorporate a story in it and to my standards I think the developers did a pretty decent job.  I'm not one of those gamers who gets all worked up about the overall plot and story of games simply because I'm more of an "in the moment" type.  Despite this, the game story does make sense (you have to really pay attention to all the in game clues and hints to figure out the "origin" story of Slender, it's like a really complicated mystery almost) and it helps the gameplay move along, but of course, there are some flaws (gaps almost- but since the update, that now seems to be because they left room to add things) so if you're a picky eater about that then this isn't the game for you. Now for everyone else who still isn't sure, just check out YouTube... you can get a pretty good idea of what the game is like just from watching well-known gaming YouTubers posting their gameplay and reactions on their channels (...plus half of them are really funny to watch).\n\nOverall, though... buy it and have a freaky time! :D","June 5, 2014","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/King_Wiley/recommended/252330/","King_Wiley","King Wiley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/King_Wiley/","137 products in account","Probably the scariest game I have ever played. Don't expect complex gameplay or intense puzzle-solving or anything like that, you should just expect to wet your pants after a while. Most of the game is just spent exploring and looking to collect a set number of items (similiar to the mod this game was based off), however don't think that means this game is boring. The game developers excel in knowing how to properly f%$k your mind while you attempt to avoid being scared. I actually have difficulty playing this game for very long at once, because I get so nervous.\n\nOne of the most outstanding parts of this game is its replayability. You would think that a game like this would have little to none; you would be wrong. The developers again excel at finding ways to make each playthrough unique, hiding items in different locations and having scares randomly generated during your playthrough. Just because you were safe in an area before means nothing the next playthrough!! One of the only downsides to this is that the game is a little bit more difficult than you would expect. Finding the locations of the items before getting killed (or giving up in fear of having a heart attack) can be frustrating when their locations change every time you die, however there is usually a pattern that can be discerned eventually.\n\nWhile this might not be the most 'fun' or 'addictive' scary game I've ever played, I would say hands-down it is the 'scariest'. I still enjoy watching my girlfriend play it and watching her scream when she turns around and slenderman is standing right behind her. If you are someone who enjoys torturing yourself through voluntary fear, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!","December 29, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There was never really a GREAT Slender game, but there was also never really a terrible Slender game. Slender: The Arrival is Parsec Production's (the original creator of Slender: The Eight Pages) first attempt at a story-driven horror game. Let me say, it's definitely an experience.\n\nThe story's introduction is kinda slow, but the game's pretty so its no big deal. Your friend, Kate, has been missing. You travel to her house in the middle of the forest, and when you get there, the doors are open and the house is a mess. After finding clues and her room key, you see that Kate was terrorized by something for quite some time. Obviously, there's a TON more to the story, missing children, looking for pages (of course), and you even get to play as Kate for a mission.\n\nThese missions aren't always "Collect 8 Pages". Sometimes it's just looking for clues, other times you have to start generators, but I won't spoil any more.\n\nSlender: The Arrival is a spot on attempt at a horror game. I pooped myself and jumped out of my seat a couple times, and I can't wait to see what else Parsec Productions and Blue Isle have for this game or the series.\n\n9/10","December 30, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I woke up with stiff muscles because I'd been so tense. It's not just Slendy anymore. There are new enemies, new challenges, new graphics, and new music. All of these add to the suspence and diarrhea inducing climate of Slender: The Arrival. If you have the money hanging around and you enjoy horror games, I recomend this. Games like Amnesia are scary, but they take time to get you into the game. Slender: The Arrival throws you head first into a vat of "Omfg it's getting dark out and I have no idea what I'm doing". This is a game where you know something's chasing you, you know something's going to pop out at you, but you still jump and scream like a cooked lobster when it happens. The game stays true to the original but adds other aspects, other levels of scary. I highly recommend this game if you want a heart racing experience and you're into wearing diapers.
