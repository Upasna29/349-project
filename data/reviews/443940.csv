The worst. There are no worse games.\n\nI can excuse the poor translations, the questionable framerates, the graphics...but this game simply is impossible to beat. It cannot be done.\n\nI spend AN HOUR WITH THIS GAME. So you can thank me later. I spent an hour with this game and I could not progress past that point. Though really, you can reach that point in about...maybe fifteen minutes, probably less. Ten? Just depends on how good you are at avoiding instakill laser "traps" and bear traps. Lots of bear traps. And lasers. And bear traps.\n\nWhich is kind of hard to do considering your character sort of wobbles around like a Teletubby on a Skittles binge. You sway side to side and step on things you didn't think you would step on.\n\nI got to a section where you have to jump from platform to platform to advance, but the mouse button that makes you jump only seems to activate at random, meaning that you will simply walk forwards without jumping into the black abyss only to respawn at the beginning platform (without even the coutesy of having your joke of a stamina meter recharge).\n\nIt was an exercise in futility. This game doesn't work. Steam refunds, you are my Jesus.\n\nTo hell with this game. I saw guns in the video, but I never made it that far. I at least wanted to get to the part with guns.

Seriously. It's so simple, and yet after nearly two hours, I still haven't been able to get through it because sometimes you will just not jump at all, no matter how hard you smash your spacebar. Also, don't be fooled by the "Load" option on the main screen, there will be no saving your progress. At least not of your own accord, even at places where I assumed the game would probably save, it didn't. Before getting to the jumping maze, I had to watch the little intro about 10 times, and then a few more times after I made the unwise decision to ALT TAB to lower my volume, and the game proceeded to crash and somehow slow my whole system down.\n\nLook, I didn't expect it to be good, I just expected it to be at least somewhat playable. I wanted hilarabad, and all I got was "Why won't you just jump?!"\n\nNever even got to shoot a gun.\n\n...I'll probably go back to it at some point because I'm a masochist and I'm determind to beat the stupid maze, but for now, I need a break.

The voices are in Russian despite picking English, which normally wouldn't be that big of a problem, because there's subtitles. Except...halfway through the game, the majority of the game's subtitles switch to Russian regardless. Maybe the story picks up then? I can't say, I don't speak Russian.\n\nThe HUD is obnoxious. It moves with you and is constantly in your way. Your stamina meter depletes ridiculously quickly, and will even deplete if you're attempting to run while caught in a bear trap. There are a ridiculous amount of bear traps in this game by the way.\n\nThe jumping mechanics are beyond awful, and you have to go through a very, very long platforming segment. There's a checkpoint about halfway through (but no save point until it's all finished), but it is still brutal.\n\nIf you make it through that, you go to another obnoxious laser grid section, and this is followed by actual enemies appearing. You have to pick up a gun nearby (if you can find it) and mow them all down with the worst shooting physics I have ever seen. If an enemy reaches you, you're screwed. It'll bounce you through the air over and over until you're dead, and you can't just aim down at them. On the plus side, they frequently glitch out and get stuck on terrain or dead bodies.\n\nIt's difficult to describe what comes after. It's a glitchfest nightmare. At one point you can hop on a train to take you to the end of a long, long tunnel, but if you hit Escape and then resume game it'll propel you infinitely forward to the end of the area where you randomly are given a minigun with infinite ammo to massacre toaster spiders (I'm not kidding). The textures also really start to glitch out around this time badly.\n\nThe last area of the game is a maze, and you're on a timer - only the timer doesn't affect anything at all. If it reaches 0, it just counts into the negatives. Whatever.\n\nEDIT: I have now beaten this game on Hard mode. It is frustratingly difficult in all the wrong ways. You get 4 minutes 30 seconds to complete the first laser grid section and the platforming section. If time runs out, you're back to the first laser grid segment. You need to really nail down how the jumping works in this, and trust me, it is not at all intuitive. You'll make it to the end with maybe 20 seconds left. The section after that is annoying, but you've got 5 minutes to do it which is way more than enough. The train section, insultingly, is 10 minutes and 2 seconds. It's stupidly easy.\n\nFor those curious, I did not get a 4-letter word upon completing Hard mode (which is supposed to unlock the Mods menu). I assume it must be hidden somewhere in-game, but there's no way I'm going to replay this to find out what it is. What a load of awfulness.\n\nEven closing and loading this game is difficult. I frequently have to Alt+F4 just to get out of it, and about 50% of the time when I load a game the game just hangs. Alt tabbing out will sometimes crash it, and this game causes major slowdown on other applications I have running. The max resolution isn't even 1080p either.\n\nDo not buy this game, even at $2. It's not worth your time or money whatsoever.","April 5","false","4.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","14","16","4","2"

For the life of me, I can't get past it. The controls are so broken it's impossible to get more than half way. You know that bug that a few games have where you can't sprint and jump at the same time? Yeah, that's it. Without sprinting, you can't get far enough, and sprinting, you can't jump.\n\nHowever, I do think that this game has potential. With a few patches here and there and I think that it'd be pretty good. The only other things I have to complain about are the bad translations. 'Press E - order to open door' and little things like that scattered here and there.\nFor the low price, I guess I'd reccomend it after the dev fixes the controls. :)","April 3","true","0.1"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","28","5","18","3","0"

The sky was black, infinitely black. No star nor God could pierce through it's shroud.\n\nA gentle wind guided me through the stone streets. Somehow, I knew that epochs have passed without a single soul passing through this place.\n\nI arrived at what passed for a town quarter. A hooded man, wrapped in bandages, sat weeping on the edge of a long dry fountain. Well, I say he was a man. In truth, he was more like what a statue would be if it could speak.\n\nI pressed a magnificent, infinitely faceted diamond into his hands. He gestured for me to lean in, to listen to what he had to say. In a language that I have never heard before, but understood perfectly, he whispered to me.\n\nI know, now. I am Aware.\n\nI have seen beyond the simulacra of this reality.
