For those who don't remember classic games such as the sixteen different versions of "Hangly-Man," a "bootleg" game was one that went beyond a cleared throat and an air-quoted "inspired by," past the bullet-riddled warning signs of "imitation of" and straight into the seedy, crack-scented chop shop of borderline counterfeiting.  Like it or hate it, one can't avoid the fact that it's a crass reskin of an existing product, muddied by free-to-play MMO clipart, an unappealing UI and a somewhat more exhausting monetization system.  The mechanics are the same.  The cards are the same. The heroes are the same.  The only difference between this and Hearthstone is that this is somehow the same thing but terrible.  If you could produce video games in a sweatshop, this is exactly the sort of game you would get.\n\nIf Hearthstone had a purchase price, I'd be giving SC:CCG a pragmatic, unsmiling thumbs up as the poor man's alternative. Since it doesn't, we have to concede that its only reason to exist is as a cynical, possibly even illegal cash grab typical of the modern mobile app market.  If you really, truly hate Blizzard and their smarmy high-fantasy IP, then by all means waste your time with THIS flavorless chunk of damp Chinese newspaper instead of THAT saccharine slice of carcinogenic angel cake.

There is one very important aspect SC is superior in- the deck diversity. In HS you play against the exact same decks over and over again, while in SC that doesnt seem to be the case.

After playing both Hearthstone and Star Crusade, I prefer Star Crusade.  I find there more diversity on how the board is controlled, within the factions play styles, and multi-turn synergy/combos.  It can be easy to download, play a few hands, and dismiss as "Hearthstone in SPACE" (Warcraft the Gathering?), but if you stick with it you will quickly see how it defines itself differently.  The basic cards you get are decently strong and I have had success with them while earning packs, so you are not immediately at a huge disadvantage.  I hope they are some how able to maintain this, as it allowed me to get into the game quickly and not eye roll when my opponents are playing the same legendary cards match after match.\n\nOther than the game itself, the UI is good.  Some of the card art is great, while some is laughable.  The voices follow the same trend, but with 350 cards thus far there will be winners and losers, and it's also subjective.  Whether you are new to CCG or have been playing MTG from the beginning this game has something to offer, and at time of writing it is only Beta.","January 19","true","115.8"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

In. SPAAAAACE!\n\nBut in all seriousness, if one hasn't already guessed from the screenshots and other reviews, it's so mechanically similar to Hearthstone that it may as well be a reskin. If that fact already turns you off from the game, I don't blame you. A lot of what you'll see in this game is something Hearthstone already does, but with far more polish. Hearthstone is by far the more developed game compared to Star Crusade, and Hearthstone doesn't take itself nearly half as seriously as Star Crusade does. It's not a bad game, but it's difficult to judge Star Crusade on its own merits when much of it is so heavily borrowed from another game.\n\nHowever, that's not to say that Star Crusade doesn't try to mix things up a little. Where there are obvious similarities, if not downright carbon-copied mechanics/classes with different labels --I'm looking at you Terran(Paladin) and Hierarchy(Priest)-- the game does try to introduce concepts you won't find in Hearthstone like Criticals, Mutate, Soak, Armored, etc. Some mechanics are not very well-explained, though, and tend to be up to the player to figure out (Criticals insta-kill, I think?) and in a CCG, not knowing what your or your enemy's cards do in the middle of a game is bad.\n\nI will say that I'm having fun with the game so far, unpolished as it is. It's certainly worth a try for the novelty of playing a Hearthstone-like game with some different features you won't find in Blizzard's own CCG. Ultimately, it's hard to say if Star Crusade is really trying to be a good alternative to Hearthstone, or if it's a cynical 'follow-the-leader' cash grab hoping to net some Blizzard fans.\n\nFor now, I give it a tentative recommendation, if only for novelty's sake and the fact that it's free, but if you're looking for a Hearthstone 2.0, this probably isn't it.","December 18, 2015","true","20.4"," 31 of 47 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","31","47","5","1"

Sadly the time of MMDoC is over, so my search for a replacement led me to try this game.  Great developers, small but helpful community, and fun game play.\n\nIt plays mechanically like Hearthstone, but has a science fiction/space theme, which personally I enjoy more than the cartoony feel Hearthstone has.\n\nRight now the game is in open beta, so some planned features are not in, but don't let that disuade you from playing.  Games are fast, factions are balanced, and accumlating the core cards for each faction is a mostly simple process.  From those cards, and with starter decks you can play even matches most of the time, with the odd time you get paired way up, but even that can be fun to just give you a taste of what cards you should be forging or praying for in packs.\n\nUPDATE:  2nd season just finished, rewards were quite nice, even if you didn't move up the ranks a huge amount.

Good I'm glad that's out of the way.\n\nI am loving and am addicted to this game. I'm a 100% free to play player as well. Yes I can tell buying packs would give you a benefit but honestly you still have to know how to use the cards correctly. This is something you cannot get until you've put some time into the game. By that point though you will have gotten enough credits for several booster packs and can probably make a decent deck for free.\n\nUnlike Hearthstone decks can have anywhere from 25-40 cards. Each player starts with 25 life but for every card more then that in your deck you get another point. So if I have a 25 card deck and my opponent has a 40 card deck I'll start with 25 life and he will start with 40. This may seem bad but honestly it's not. With 25 card decks they are very focused and you have much higher chances of getting the cards you need. In fact I rarely lose to people with 40 card decks but lose to the people rolling 25 all the time lol.\n\nThe presentation for the game is top notch as far as I'm concerned. I mean there is only so much you can do with a ccg. I  think it's one of the better looking/sounding card games out there.\n\nAnother HUGE plus are the devs. They are very active on the forums and respond to almost any question posted. They have even been known to give people boosters if they report bugs/problems with the game. They may seriously be the most open devs I've ever got a game from.\n\nThe one negative I have for the game though is it doesn't do a great job of explaining what different abilities are. I'm positive almost everyone says "wtf is firepower" their first few games. This isn't a big issue imo though b/c after a handful of games you'll have a good grasp.\n\nIn the end I cannot recomend this game enough. Yes it's very Hearthstone like but unless you're just in love with the Warcraft lore (hey nothing wrong with that!) I really feel as if this game has it beat. It also doesn't hurt that this is new and it does NOT require a significant investment to start if you want to be competitive, unlike Hearthstone.","December 29, 2015","true","177.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

(Casual/Quickmatch, Raid/Draft, Ranked)\n\nCan´t give it a thumbs up though, because every keycard for every class is locked behind crafting or unlocked by opening boosters (some with a horrendous price in crafting materials). The free cards that are unlocked until lvl 11, don´t really change the gameplay for a class. You are mostly stuck with neutrals and have a few class cards in the deck and you can only get credit for new boosters by winning. (Dailes included obviously) Might get better later on, when more keycards are unlocked. But you will have a rough time until then, as a F2P with basic decks.\n\nI won´t bring the P2W argument, because every competitive ccg/tcg is P2W at some point.\n\nWill play it, until "Chronicle: Runescape Legends" moves from CB into OB, since I´m enjoying C:RL way more, with it´s new and fresh playstyle.\n\nIf you are looking for a ccg similar to Hearthstone, like Sci-Fi and don´t mind the grind.

Star Crusade. The card game I've always wanted.\n\nI love this game, yet hate it. The moments you win, you feel really amazing, but the moments you lose - it's usually because the other players commander choice is built around a really douchey playstyle ( looking at you, Mercenary and Psychic deck users ) but that's just cos I'm a salty scrub who mainly plays Terran ;P\n\nYeah, the formula around this game is definitely Hearthstone at its core - but it adds more choices and strategy to it which makes me prefer it way more. Firepower, Energy, Armor, Soak - so many crazy choices of builds and playstyles you can make, my personal favorite is making a Firepower deck that's based around building up as much firepower as I can and then around turn 8 I drop a beastly 5/10 ship with +4 Firepower - then turn 9 I hopefully have the Commander Promotion card or 2 to drop in it and based on how much firepower I have, it can be from 9/14 to 20/26 or maybe even more.

The mechanics will seems pretty familiar to Heartstone players but this is all.  THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES TOO!!\n\n1 - DECK SIZE : You deck is not forced to have 30 cards and can range from 25 to 40 (which also decide what are your starting HP).  The beefier your deck, the more HP but less chances to get your combos fast.\n\n2 - ENERGY : Each commander have an energy bank that grows either at the end of your turn or by doing damages to opponent units and commander.  This bank can be use to activate abilities on some cards.\n\n3 - MODULES : The abilities of your commander can be changed with module.  This is changed before the game in the deckbuilder and it defines your modules at the start of the game.  You begin with one and two ''empty spaces'' (you can have a maximum of 3 modules and you can even change the one they give you free).  This leads to different deck mechanics.  Right now, cards are limited but as the game expand it will be a good thing for diversity.\n\n4 - RAID MODE : The raid mode is the ''arena'' of Star Crusade.  It will offers you to make a deck from random cards but you will progress on a map as you win games.  This will lead to different ''candies'' you can get from winning.\n\nIf combined, those three aspects really change the game from Hearthstone.  IT IS NOT A PALE COPY even if some cards are direct copy-paste.  Every CCG/TCG have some aspects in common.

Personally, I was not a fan of the "feel" (artwork and music) of Hearthstone, but I attribute that to the cartoonish nature of WoW itself.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly quick, depending on decks used. There are a few issues I noticed, several which I read are being adressed in future updates-\n\nMatchmaking- It can get severly imbalanced at times, but I haven't run into too many issues.\n\nTimers - Timers count down and board control simply switches to the opponent. I had a match where a player ran the clock down intentionally, so I did the same. We turned a simple match into an hour long staring contest.\n\nScrap- To create a common, it takes 10 Scrap. When you scrap a common, you get 1 Scrap. You literally need 10 extra (more than 2, although you can scrap any cards you wish) cards just to create a singular common. While it creates demand for in-game purchases, I believe the ratio needs adjusting.\n\nIt's not a bad game, and I will continue to play it.

I  believe at the moment that is the main issue the game devs of Star Crusade have to face, dealing with ignorance. No, this is not that other game in space. It's so much more and i'm worried this game will live only in the shadow of that other game just because that game came first.\n\nThis is a solid CCG on it's own merits. It has way more depth and strategy possibilities than that other game for example. Does it make use of some elements? Yes, it does. Most notably the supply system and the fact that you can only have 10 cards in your hand and 7 creatures in play. And it ends there! The game itself has so much more depth than that other popular CCG that shall remain nameless in this review. In fact it's so much more distinct from it that it can be a little daunting to a new player coming from that game!\n\nIt's free to play so i urge everyone to just give it a try and decide for yourselves! That's the only problem with Star Crusade at the moment, low player base. So just give it a try and see if you like it. If you like a sci-fi themed card game you wont be disappointed. Just look at what all these other famous people have to say about it!!\n\n\n"Great game this one is!" - Master Yoda\n\n"Heck, after a long day shoottin alliens i stopped for a quick beer and saw this game, gave it a try and now i can't stop shootin some more darn aliens.

Even though this game is still in early access as of the writing of this review, I feel that this is one of the best digital CCGs available. The game can be a little difficult at times with the limited player base and on-going balance tweaks that are inherent in any game that is still in development, but the unique setting and approach to gameplay make this a very enjoyable gaming experience. Also, the developers have been extremely generous to the player base, offering two daily quests each day rewarding extra in game credits (used for buying additional card backs and initiating new raids), instituting a reward system for ranked play that provides players with extra booster packs, credits, and scrap (used for crafting individual cards) for reaching key rank thresholds on the ladder each month, and additional rewards for unlocking specific Steam achievments. With all of their generosity, I have yet to spend a single penny on this game and still feel that I am competitive, even against some of the players who have been playing Star Crusade for months and who have nearly full card and module collections. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Star Crusade and look forward to all of the upcoming developments.\n\nEdit: Firstly, I want to remind people that this game is still in Early Access Development as of the writing of this update (June 1st, 2016) and as such it is still undergoing significant balance and performance changes. For example, the latest update which released this week has implemented a 5 minute grace period in which you are not supposed to be matched against your previous opponent in either the ranked or raid game modes. This change is a huge quality of life improvement for the game as it reduces the likelihood of entering into the dreaded "death spiral" of being matched against the same opponent multiple times in a row which has been a major frustration of the player base at-large for some time.\n\nThis is just one example of the changes being made to the game right now and it also highlights the fact that the devs are listening to the feedback the community is providing through the discussion forums and game review posts on Steam, the posts to their recently launched discord server, and the in-game bug report and feedback messages. The devs have also made it clear that an improved tutorial system and additional localizations for the game are on their way along with many other new features which they plan to have implemented between now and the official release date for this game.","May 5","true","80.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

This game runs fine, looks fine, sounds fine (though i've given some suggestions about the sound, like voices playing everytime you attack with a card etc.), and the deck builder is without problems too, i have at least not found any.\n\nEnding Note(s):\n\n1. If this game really is "Heartstone in space", then i just might (a very big "might", but still) go and try HS out, but for now i will play SC CCG.\n\n2. I usually stay away from early access games, since the game might/will change a lot before final, and because Valve seemingly don't make sanctions against developers who just cash grab and then abandons ship (I can think of many reasons why Valve wouldn't, but that's for another day), but i do recommend Star Crusade CCG, since it is F2P and (as for now at least) doesn't require you to buy stuff in-game.\n\n*Thumbs up*\n\nPS.

I know everyone else has mentioned this, so I will as well. There are many things borrowed, and that can be good and bad.  If you play hearthstone the game will be instantly accessible and comfortable, with a few different powers and keywords to learn. If you are looking for something different, you may find there is enough of a difference to give this one a test, especially if you are not a fan of the RNG, as so many are not. This game shares some elements of hearthstone yes but it is trying to cut its own path.\n\nThe graphics are hit and miss, the menus are only OK and the backgrounds are mostly static, but some of the art is absolutely amazing. Some of the cards look like they come right out of an old buck rogers comic or HR Geiger exhibit depending on your race. Some are a  little bit not good (pulse rifles, you need to change right now) But mostly, I really enjoy the look and feel of the game.\n\nThe matches are fast and furious, and while starting out the game can be daunting (the first many matches/few days will be harrowing as you build your collection) due to the fact that many people you will be matched with will have much superior decks/know how to play, if you stick with it you will be rewarded with a game that has deceptive depth. The amount of keywords, cards and configurations in the first set is rich and rewarding. Is it as deep as hearthston? not quite, but that game has been out for years. I honestly think this is a much better game out of the gate (and in beta) than hearthstone was when it first launched.\n\nOver all I highly recommend giving this a shot and sticking through the first few missions to grab a few of the rarer cards and trying to learn the ins and outs of the game.\n\nI was inspired to write this review by firstofficer, a (the?) developer who is taking the time to respond and post to everyone who is posting in his forum. Excellent dev support, I see you are listening, the players are out here!

There are alot of interesting mechanics that are to be discovered, which function uniquely within this game set.\nThe cards aren't hard to obtain as the game is pretty rewarding. There are multiple ways to get cards, not only through the cash shop (though, the devs need support at this point).\nWhether you play casual, ranked or raid (draft mode) the game boasts an exciting gameplay which is followed by excellent backgroud sci-fi music along with beautiful artwork.\nAnd the very importart part is the community which is helpful and constructive; it is very easy to contact anyone in game and seek advice, but very often experienced players will offer advice on their own.\nThe devs are very caring and responsive, there is alot of feedback going back and forth and every player gets a feeling of being included.\nI highly recommend this game, so join us and see you in orbit :)","February 2","true","267.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

The balance among the races is really good as I have been able to win with each one several times. The developer seems to listen and take in community suggestions during the beta/early access and has put out some updates and another one is right around the corner.  Also the prizes and giveaways are generous, more than other games I have played in recent memory which is nice.\n\nNot sure why people downvote the game because it is like Blizzard HS CCG. They are all CCG online games and there is only so much variety, but this one is worth your time if you are sick of HS, like sci-fi or are new to CCG and want to get in and try from the ground up before 100,000 people are playing (which I can only hope for).\n\nOh and all cards you gain during beta/early access are yours, the game is not being wiped according to developers upon official release 1.0, whenever that will be.\n\nA few things to note for someone just starting off:\n1)  there is no help within the game beyond the quick tutorial. (It is planned supposedly but not impletmented yet).  You will feel lost at times, but after about 10 hours and many non-ranked games you get a feel for things fairly quick.  If you have played other CCGs online this curve will be a bit less steep for you.\n\n2)  there are not 100,000 players so at this time during early access you do play a lot of high end players and can/may get frustrated when you start off. I know I did at first and wanted to pitch my screen across the desk after 3 rounds in a row vs top 5 opponent. BUT it is also a great time to learn and debug the game,and once I came to terms with that I have been progressing more and seeing the great CCG that it is.\n\n3)  Raids are great as it is a random pick of 30 cards.  But remember you will not have the experience and knowledge of combos and playstyles under your belt so you will be destroyed 90% of the time until you learn.  Do not waste your credits on Raids until you have a lot of spare credits lying around. Once I stopped raiding and started using the earned credits for packs my non-raid decks got better, i started enjoying the game more, and then I was able to throw in a raid now and again and I win 1 or 2 raid games out of 5 games where I used to lose 3 straight and raid was over. But to each their own, odds are you are better than I am at this game. :)\n\n4)  There is a new players guide up on Steam which wasn't there when I started. Read it. WIll help with the knowledge base and allow you to build a playable deck without all the top cards (which aren't needed as much as I thought).","January 28","true","128.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","1"

I have never played Hearthstone, MTG, or any of the others. Because of this, I went in having very few expectations. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe first think that came as a shock was the easy to learn interface. I've always thought of CCG/TCG's as very complicated games that can take years to learn and collect cards for. However, the tutorial is very comprehensive. I was familiar with the interface in minutes, and had created my own custom deck within the first hour.\n\nAnother pleasant surprise was the lack of pay-to-play elements. I've become accustomed to pretty much every free game on Steam being P2P, giving me a greater appreciation for a game that is truly free to play. Yes, there are in-game purchases, but anything that can be bought with actual money is either cosmetic or can be bought with the in-game currency.\n\nFinally, the gameplay was fun. It is a bit unbalanced, as some classes are better than others, and the RNG can be unfair at times, but overall it is still an enjoyable experience. The visual effects are good, much better than those of Spellweaver, another digital CCG that I downloaded after I started Star Crusade. The replayability is nearly infinite, as ranked seasons and daily missions offer reasons to come back to this game time and time again.\n\nOverall, I give it a 7.5/10.","May 5","true","18.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It plays exactly like hearthstone, but with a sci-fi theme, and frankly, that doesn't have to be a bad thing.\n\nI'm knocking this game for being...well..stupid.  Or broken, I can't tell which.\n\nMy main issues are:\n\n1) I can't unlock any factions.  Game says "defeat these leaders in any game mode to unlock the faction".  Ok, super.  Problem is that you can't create any custom games to choose a leader you want to challenge.  Your opponents are completely random when playing the AI and you never get a faction that you weren't given by default when you started.\n\nYou also can't purchase any faction unlocks or leaders with the in-game currency that you earn from winning or doing quests/dailies.\n\n2) You can't buy anything other than booster packs, currently.  The store hints at all these things to unlock with the money you receive, but you can't actually buy anything.\n\n3) It's about as rich in story as a Kardashian biography.  There's just a bunch of random factions with short blurbs about each leader, nothing to really tie them together, certainly no campaigns available to starting players- at least none that I can unlock....\n\nThe artwork is good, the UI is simple, if not better than HearthStone, but the menus and mouseovers could use some work.  The animations and background are pretty good as well.\n\nI'll change my rating if things change, but currently, can't recommend, pretty stale experience gameplay wise and pretty frustrating to not be able to explore the game fully.\n\nEdit** I'll now bump this up to a 5/10 and recommend the game by the slimmest of margins.  I suddenly got to play some different commanders to play against (squeaky wheel?? lol) so perhaps my RNG in drawing a different commander was just horri-bad, but it still doesn't change the fact that you can't choose who you want to play and the store is still busted.","January 20","true","4.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

While I expect I will spend money on this game in the near future in order to help the developers' efforts, I find it refreshing to find a free game that does not force you to make purchases to compete at a high level.

I found something akin to a wiki online but it had very little info, the quality of information was bad and thus it felt pointless to use as it didn't give anymore info than ingame card descriptions.\n\nGame is either bugged, people cheat, or tooltip is entirely wrong/bugged. I've on many occations seen cards display a particular tooltip during combat, just to see it say something entirely different in combat logg, that is extremely frustrating and further re-enforces the sensation of being cheated.\n\nTypical scenario: Card said it would do 2 dmg, but all of a sudden did 4? In some of those cases all you see is a lightining icon between the cards in combat logg so you have no clue what actually happened and why your card didn't do the damage it was supposed to despite no cypher being used by opponent, why their card did more damage than the initial tooltip said, or why that card that was intended to split it's damage did all of it to a single unit literally cheating you out of victory.\n\nBalance seems to be bonkers, cheese strats are king, like having your opponent  hierarchy player create som 8/8 shielded monster on 2 supply, consortium flooding the entire deck and your hand with sabotage cards on 2 supply etc.\n\nI believe this is due to the vast ammount of no cost cards, which makes these cheese strats so powerful, literally making many games pointless to play past the first or second round or even past card drawing phase.\n\nRaid seems to be a waste of time unless you are a pro.\n\nGame is predictable, I can literally guess which BS card my opponents will topple me with most of the times by now, I'm generally rather surprised when they do NOT play that particular BS card as they seem to always have an answer to everything you do.

Il sistema di abbinamento dei giocatori deve ancora essere bilanciato a dovere e, spesso, giocando in classificata,si viene abbinati allo stesso avversario più volte di fila o contro avversari di rank superiore, ma questo è dovuto al fatto che è un gioco in accesso anticipato e la playerbase è ancora piccola,ma destinata a crescere.\nConcludo dicendo che è veramente facile ottenere risorse per acquistare pacchetti,dato che ogni giorno si ricevono 2 missioni da 30 gold ed ogni vittoria da 5 gold, i pacchetti costano 100 gold ciascuno e hanno 6 carte;inoltre, grazie alla gentilezza degli sviluppatori che spesso rilasciano codici promozionali, in 2 mesi sono riuscito ad avere praticamente tutte  le carte comuni e rare in doppia copia e molte carte leggendarie, quelle che non si trovano possono essere sempre craftate.Un plauso agli sviluppatori che continuano a seguire l'evoluzione del gioco bilanciando continuamente le carte!\n\nINGLESE\n\nI am a longtime player of CCG, and i think that this is one of the best CCG ever made;there are a lot of factions, all with their own units and ways to play; there are a lot of ways to play every single faction with the use of the modules (new hero powers added to base power) this gives to the game great variety and a strategy deeper than in the game that inspired Star Crusade (Hearthstone , where there is only one way to play every class). The matchmaking system need some fixes,because often, when you play in ranked mode, you face the same opponent, or an opponent of an higher rank, but this is because the game is in Beta phase and the playerbase is still low but it will grows very fast!\nIn this game is really easy to collect the resources to buy new booster packs, infact you get 2 mission every day that give 30 gold each ,every victory gives 5 gold, and a pack costs 100 gold and gives 6 cards.\nI have to spent a word about the kindness of the developers, that give very often some promo codes; in two months i have got all common and rare cards and some good paragon cards (legendary) ,and there is the possibility to craft the other cards.\nMy approval to the developers that continue to follow the evolution of the game and are ready to balance the cards that became too strong or too weak!","May 5","true","69.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I say this as someone who has played Hearthstone, MTG (online and IRL), Might and Magic, and Runescape Legends - just to name a few CCG.  Yet I like this one the best, why?  First of all I simply prefer the aesthetic of this game.  It is the only futuristic card game that I have played in a seemingly endless tide of medieval-fantasy.  That and it is the only CCG I've found where it is truly possible to excel and progress meaningfully, in terms of rank and card collection, without throwing tons of money.  Many CCGs are free-to-play but, oftentimes, pay-to-win-more.  Note that this is how things stand as of the moment I am writing this review; and, as it stands, I have been able to keep a solid winrate and acquire many high-end cards without needing to pay anything.  As someone with not a lot of cash, this is fantastic.\n\nMany will compare this game to Hearthstone, and while that is true (they are very similar on multiple points), the new mechanics of having multiple, exchangeable hero powers and also have Energy as a second resource to Supply makes this game feel completely new and fresh.  As someone who played Hearthstone from the beta, I now find Star Crusade to be a much more compelling experience simply because the devs are not afraid to print cards that are extremely powerful or can create mega combos.  Right of the gate some of the best cards in the game are given to you as basics - it's just up for you to figure them out.\n\nPersonally, I have had tons of fun with this game and I cannot understand why it is so poorly received.  Most likely, people have not given it the time of day to understand that Star Crusade does enough different to excite someone who has played other CCGs while maintaining a similar formula that will leave you feeling comfortable.  It is vastly underrated - I love this game, as it stands so far.","May 12","true","27.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I found something akin to a wiki online but it had very little info, the quality of information was bad and thus it felt pointless to use as it didn't give anymore info than ingame card descriptions.\n\nGame is either bugged, people cheat, or tooltip is entirely wrong/bugged. I've on many occations seen cards display a particular tooltip during combat, just to see it say something entirely different in combat logg, that is extremely frustrating and further re-enforces the sensation of being cheated.\n\nTypical scenario: Card said it would do 2 dmg, but all of a sudden did 4? In some of those cases all you see is a lightining icon between the cards in combat logg so you have no clue what actually happened and why your card didn't do the damage it was supposed to despite no cypher being used by opponent, why their card did more damage than the initial tooltip said, or why that card that was intended to split it's damage did all of it to a single unit literally cheating you out of victory.\n\nBalance seems to be bonkers, cheese strats are king, like having your opponent  hierarchy player create som 8/8 shielded monster on 2 supply, consortium flooding the entire deck and your hand with sabotage cards on 2 supply etc.\n\nI believe this is due to the vast ammount of no cost cards, which makes these cheese strats so powerful, literally making many games pointless to play past the first or second round or even past card drawing phase.\n\nRaid seems to be a waste of time unless you are a pro.\n\nGame is predictable, I can literally guess which BS card my opponents will topple me with most of the times by now, I'm generally rather surprised when they do NOT play that particular BS card as they seem to always have an answer to everything you do. Especially in the ranked environment.\n\nGame takes alot of patience, especially due to the cheating/tooltip error or whatever it is and neverending cheese strats, mine has run out.","May 18","false","41.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I know what you're thinking, and this game pretty much plays just like Hearthstone.\n\nPROS\nIf you've played Hearthstone, you'll pretty much know how to play this game right away. Firepower and Spell Damage, Assault and Windfury, or Cyphers and Secrets, etc. etc. In my opinion, it's not a bad thing to be similar. You know what they say, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." The core Hearthstone mechanics are here. Draw some cards, gain a point of mana, play some cards, rinse and repeat... Though there's only a handful of mechanics that are different, there's enough to force different strategies. Take for example, the Module mechanic, it's pretty much a Hero Power, but you're allowed to customize these in a way that dictates your deck.\n\nAnd on a side note, the cards are pretty nice to look at.\n\n\nCONS\nGame plays very slowly and it's quite easy to screw up your turns. Hate to sound like a broken record, but with Hearthstone, you can pretty much play all your cards, end  your turn, and watch it play out. Try this with Star Crusde and I guarantee you it'll ignore 50% of your moves and still let you end your turn. So what happens is, you have to play one card at a time and wait for it to play out before playing your next card.\n\nThis game's version of Arcane Dust is Scrap. However, disenchanting/scrapping cards barely returns any Scrap and most of the cards are friggin' expensive. Almost not worth it to even try and scrap anything.\n\nAnd lastly, this game's  version of Arenas, called Raids. You have to pay with your Gold/Credits or use real money just to get in. It's a giant barrier to entry when you get bored of the standard play mode.\n\n\nEXTRA\nYeah, this game is Early Access, so it's a given that there's not that many people. However, more often than not, I find myself paired up with the same person over and over again. Almost becomes habit to just take turns and concede.","May 16","true","18.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This just seems to me a natural adaption of a physical card game into something you can play on a computer.  I like the unique sci-fi theme of the game, its pretty simple to play and yet has a nice variety of unit types and additional abilities for each playable character.  An interesting feature is having to face off against a locked player to obtain it.  Also the ability to buy a single pack with in game credits is a nice balance to asking for a cash purchase for multiple packs.  This is also in Hearthstone's style shop, but its a nice to have that option.  If you're really into it and you got a few bucks to drop on a bunch of packs its not much different than when I'd got to a store and buy a pack of magic cards when I used to play it.\nThe audio is decent, fitting for its them and the graphics are nicely presented in a functional UI thats easy to understand.  The tutorial is a little forced on you in the beginning but passes quickly so it wasn't that much off your time before getting to the game itself.\nIf you liked CCG and just casual play with some complex stratagey elements, you'll probably enjoy this.

If you like the (real life) card games Magic The Gathering or NetRunner, you'll love this game.\n\nCons:\n\n- Currently, you can only chat with your opponent if he already is in your friends list. At least, one can use several emotes. Fortunately, no chat means no spamming and no insulting by kiddies. They may add a chat later.\n- Some cards are still inbalanced (e.g. Modules) but balancing is in progress (the game is still in beta).\n- You'll encounter a bug from time to time, but overall the game is very stable.\n- Often it takes a while to find games because the player base isn't very big. Probably, this will improve when the game will be released on further platforms (e.g. mobile) and when the game will leave the Beta phase.\n\nPros:\n\n- In my opinion, the game currently isn't pay-to-win (P2W). How many money someone spent on the game doesn't make a huge difference. It is more important to know how to build good decks (i.e. skill) than to have all rare cards. Of course, it will make things easier by buying a few booster packs (the company somehow has to make some money to pay the developers, doesn't it?).\n- The game is rather generous. You can earn cards for free by winning against opponents, finishing daily quests, finding promo codes (e.g. in the forums) and by having an improved rank at the end of a season.\n- Scrap mechanic: You can melt duplicate or unneeded cards to forge new cards. This means that, theoretically, you can choose from all existing cards. Of course, the rare cards will cost a lot of scrap but that's still better than having to depend on finding a certain card in a booster.\n- The luck factor in the game is just right. You'll lose if you just depend on luck instead of building a decent deck. However, there is still enough luck involved to make the game exciting.\n- Good graphics and sound effects.\n- Space theme. The theme is very varied. It doesn't reduce to space ships!\n- It is possible to play against bots in Practice and Casual Mode. You'll automatically play against a bot in Casual Mode, if you can't find an opponent after a certain time. The bots currently are very dumb but they are sufficient to learn the game and to level your heroes.\n\nIf you still are not convinced that the game is good, download and install it! It is free to play.\n\nThis review is about Star Crusade 1.0.2.5.S822 (Beta).\n","May 5","true","79.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This just seems to me a natural adaption of a physical card game into something you can play on a computer.  I like the unique sci-fi theme of the game, its pretty simple to play and yet has a nice variety of unit types and additional abilities for each playable character.  An interesting feature is having to face off against a locked player to obtain it.  Also the ability to buy a single pack with in game credits is a nice balance to asking for a cash purchase for multiple packs.  This is also in Hearthstone's style shop, but its a nice to have that option.  If you're really into it and you got a few bucks to drop on a bunch of packs its not much different than when I'd got to a store and buy a pack of magic cards when I used to play it.\nThe audio is decent, fitting for its them and the graphics are nicely presented in a functional UI thats easy to understand.  The tutorial is a little forced on you in the beginning but passes quickly so it wasn't that much off your time before getting to the game itself.\nIf you liked CCG and just casual play with some complex stratagey elements, you'll probably enjoy this.  There aren't too many Sci-fi CCGs as there is Fantasy.","April 2","true","69.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Imagine HS in sci-fi-setting and with 3 different way of spending currency to use cards/hero powers, Supply(mana)/credits(gold coins) and energy, (also you choose which 1-3 heropowers you want in your deck building process).\n\nIt seems like the dev team is trying to make it a balanced game by adjusting things unlike blizzard who doesn't do anything for years.

Pretty much it.\n\nEach turn you generate an additional resource to play cards.  So like hearthstone, the early game is essential while late game, you better hope you have a big expensive card ready to play.  I like these kinds of games.  Magic the Gathering was always irritating to me when you didn't get enough land cards to play anything early game.  So you were pretty much screwed.\n\nThe UI is nearly identical to Hearthstone as well.  Cards on the bottom.  Resource pool next to your avatar.  Avatar special ability next to the avatar as well.  The dev's took deep inspiration from Hearthstone.\n\nThe cash shop could get expensive.  Also like Hearthstone, you can do daily quests to earn credits to spend on booster packs.  So, play the game long enough and you'll have all the cards.\n\nThe art work is pretty poor imo.  Many of the character drawings lack any form of detail.  The ship cards look alright I suppose.\n\nLike Hearthstone yet again....this game comes down to playing the most cheapest cards you can early on so you flood the board with monsters.  You can attack your opponent as many times as you have monsters.  I've noticed just flooding the battleground with cards that force your opponent to attack them, and not your hero, wins you the game.  Then you proceed to attack their hero with cheap cards over and over.","December 15, 2015","true","0.4"," 32 of 61 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","32","61","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DamonIsa/recommended/415270/","DamonIsa","DamonIsa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DamonIsa/","21 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nChecked out this game because, honestly, Sci-Fi and Card Game is generally up my alley. Didn't take long to realize it's a Sci-Fi painting of Hearthstone of course, as many reviews have pointed out. But at first it didn't bother me. Honestly I never cared for the style of Warcraft myself so I thought I'd give it an honest try.\n\nThe problems though mostly relate to difficulty curve. Hearthstone, as much as I might not personally care for it, at least has a decent chance of making matches that you feel like you at least had a chance at it. Yes I get curb stomped sometimes, but I never felt completely impotent and outmatched in these horrible, one sided squashes.\n\nBut that's what Star Crusade is at its heart. Once I got out of the tutorial game, I never faced a single match where I was anything but hopelessly outclassed. Even when I tried the Raid Mode, figuring that as a Draft Mode we'd all be on equal footing Deck Wise with the challenges out there, I got utterly destroyed in 3 straight rounds against the first "Easy" mission of the Raid. No contest, barely got any offense in and hardly could have a card in play for a full turn, and those cases only if I got the first card drop.\n\nYou might read this, think it just means I suck, which could be fair. But it's not like I'm a Card Game newb either, done plenty of Draft Nights for Magic, etc. I get the basic theories of the game, the basic probabilities and mechanics. The only thing I can guess is involved in this utter crushing is two factors...\n\nOne is a lack of good match making/balancing formulas for the game. A major problem, the sort of thing that can ruin your night as much as stepping into your first Ladder Qualifier games in StarCraft II only to find yourself getting mopped up by a Diamond Leaguer 5 times in a row. Possible that it could be fixed but until it does, it'll just be bad times.\n\nBut the Raid Mode revealed a second issue perhaps at hand, as I got to play against the same deck and AI three times in a row. They stack the enemy's deck. Legitimately every single game started with the exact same 7 first turn drops for the enemy. Considering you start with 4 cards in a 40 card deck the chance that you could even have the same turn one drop (2 Cards duped in a deck max) is astronomical. Suggests a huge screw job with the enemy Bots and such.\n\nFor my time, I rather not face what is effectively someone so blatantly cheating and being so heavily outmatched that if I were playing at the Tabletop with them I'd reach over and slap them.","January 15","false","2.3"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

If you're into paying or grinding to keep up with the field, pick this game up by all means.  Some critics say this game's a Hearthstone clone, but Star Crusade CCG *does* have unique elements that make it worth looking at.  But the pay/grind wall makes this a title I can't recommend at this time.\n\nAs it is, other computer CCGs that I know of similarly have pay / grind walls, so I'm continuing to play this on and off.  But the moment a good computer CCG comes along, I'm dropping this title completely.  (Unless this game makes changes to the pay/grind structure, then I'll stick with this one.  But that hasn't happened yet, and there's no sign it will at this time.)\n\n(edit) Noted a developer commented on my review.  On the day after Christmas, no less.  But the mentioned changes do not alter the fundamental pay / grind mechanics.   Dropping the daily limit, changing daily-missions-for-in-game-credit - there are pros and cons to each, but essentially neither changes the basic situation.\n\nAs to top decks containing few heroic/paragon tier cards, - well, if there are expansions for the game (and why not, that's the nature of CCGs), then more heroic / paragon tier cards will be released, and those will be rotated into more competitive decks.  Over time, this will mean decks will contain more and more rare cards, so players just joining will face a massive pay / grind wall to try to be competitive, and players that are already playing will have to pay or grind to keep up.  It won't be a sudden and drastic change with the next expansion, but over time there'll be a considerable cumulative effect.\n\nMind, though, just because the developer didn't fully address the pay / grind mechanic, doesn't mean they are unaware, or that they intend to ignore those concerns.  Even if they *did* intend to change things, and immediately, it's a huge change of direction.  That means talks with financing, discussions, conferences, meetings, &c.  Of course, they might *already* have had those meetings and had some theoretical scenarios based on anticipated monetizations but . . . they chose to do things as they did, as they are currently implemented.  Changing at this point is not something that will be done lightly (if at all.)\n\nSo though I must commend the developer on the quick response (especially on the day after Christmas), I do not change my review to one in favor of the game, as I think the pay / grind mechanic is still the major issue.\n\nAgain, for players that really don't care about a pay / grind wall, by all means, I think it's not badly done.  I can make some observations about the art being gender discriminatory, or say the mechanics are limited by the current design (they are), or make other criticisms, but the fact is they *have* done some interesting things with this game that are well worth checking out - provided you go in with your eyes open and know what you're getting into.","December 26, 2015","false","39.7"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","2"

It's a science-fiction themed version of that, basically, but with more complexity and customization beyond that which you see in HS. There's still a few things they're ironing out, but what's already there is functional. The cards themselves are interesting and fun, and learning the different synergies and strategies and how to counter them is a good effort.\n\nTrying out the game, unlocking every starter card and ability by ranking up with the different commanders is a good way to introduce yourself to Star Crusade. Even if the game as a whole doesn't catch your attention by the time you complete the unlocks, it's an engaging process that's rewarding enough in and of itself.","May 8","true","40.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's akin to hearthstone though it has a few more game-play mechanics. The Sci-fi look and feel appeals to me more than hearthstone's theme. The Dev's often have promotional events where promo codes are given out so getting booster packs isn't a chore like it is in hearthstone, you still have work for them a bit but it /is/ easier. All in all, it has less polish and a few less features than hearthstone but that will be remedied with time, and already I believe it is a better game than hearthstone.","May 8","true","93.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I spent $20 for 20 packs and I unlocked only about 50% of the cards - not to mention having duplicates of any of the rares. Plus, my duplicates only created 98 scrap. . .  out of 20 packs, so it is going to take either an enormous time or money investment to be at all competitive.\n\nTo get one pack for free it requires that you beat both daily missions and have 8 wins. After that, you need 20 wins for each pack unlock. So, it is going to take a while if you don\'t want to throw money at it.\n\nThese are all things I can forgive to some degree. They may just be starting out greedy because players forgive becoming more generous but get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you make the game tighter-fisted later on. However, what I have a real problem with and the ultimate reason for not recommending this game at this point is that they do not have AI bots to play against in the \"raid\" mode. As a result, I waited literally over ten minutes without getting a match and gave up on it. It\'s great to try to get players to play against one another, but you have to have bots to prime the pump. No one should ever wait longer than 3 minutes for a match.","June 1","false","8.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Seriously , it is incredible how many stuff they copied from that game.\nI wonder if they will have same legal problems because of it with activision/blizzard. I do not care about HS at all, but this is a blatant copy, so i would suggest you not to spend your money on this game until the coast is clear.\nBut then again I would advise people to save theri money and not spend it or this game or HS. it is just a waste of money and time.\n\nThem copying HS by it self is not a bad thing since HS visual design for example  is great. Problem is that they copied also all the bad things from that game and made some things even worse.\n\nI do hope they will have no legal problems because that would mean others can copy HS also and maybe then we could have a game similar to HS in some regards but without all the problems.\n\nNow the review:\n\n1, For some this will not be the problem but for me constant screen shakes and all the lights and similar visual effects are just too much. If they add an option to turn those effects OFF it would imorove theg ame for me a lot. Now I fell more like looking away then looking at the game. Even HS has less of those effects.\n\n( update - developers response was something like " but we all love those effects, no one complained, lets hear what others have to say and if a lot of people complain maybe we will change some things... / So it is your tipcal bunch of developers that LOVE adding all the cool effects and if you do not like that then tuff luck. Only reason why games have EPILEPSY WARRNING on them is because of pkids like that.\n\nThis is not an online shooter where i would be at a disadvantage if i turn that garbage off.\n\n\nSome of you could say how they are correct and how they should only care about the things that most people want. Ok, lets go that way, most people want this game not to be a grind pay to win game. So do they listen people when it comes to that. No.\n\n\n2. Pay to win -  you can expect from this game to become more and more pay to win as time goes by\n\nQuest sistem aka" win 2 games with this class or that one" that force you to play classes you do not like or do not have good cards for. You can replace one quest just like in HS also but it does seem that it will be a heavily grind based game like HS also. Pay to win is just too much. Does not matter if you want to spend money or not since games now are based upon how to earn more money only and not about how to acctualy make a game better and balance.\n\n3. No way to talk with your opponent. Optional chat should be there. You can add them after the game, just like in HS. Am I playing against bots or real people? I sure can not tell.\n\n4.EMOTES! One of the most irritating things in HS are in this game also with no way to disable that. Option to permanently turn that off should be there. Acctualy emotes should not be there in the first place. It is 2016 and these "developers' are acctualy making games with less and less options.\n\nIt is like they cant even think by them self. Just because HS is succesful that does not mean everything about that game is great, Emotes are nothing but a stupid troll tool.  Game should have a regualr chat - way to talk with your opponent even if he is not your friend and of course it should have an option to turn all chat off if you do not want to talk to people.\n\nAlso there should be lobby chat or something like that.\n\n\n5. The game is in early acces and everyone with some expirience with games that are in EA knows what that mean. it mean that they wiill use that as an excuse for every problem and it means that they will not improve the game once it is released or maybe they will even make it worse.","December 15, 2015","false","1.9"," 45 of 89 people (51%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","51","45","89","9","1"

Perhaps because of departure from cartoony Hearthstone style to a more dark W40k-like universe.\n\nEye-candy:\n* UI and playground is very pleasant to the eye and efficient\n* Most awesome [End turn] button\n* The factions create a feel like there is solid lore behind them\n* Card art is superb.\n* All visual special effects are joy to the heart\n* Voiceover for card actions is amusing ("Don't shoot, I'm a medic!

On the surface it is standard carbon copy of heartstone with minimal variations. Even in classes you can see carbon copy of the hero classes in the heartstone - here is your paladin , here is your shaman , there is your priest.... You catch the drift. It might be interesting to play this game for theme change and those tiny variations in the ruleset(i.e. soak rule that absorbs x amount of damage from each attack against the unit), but the here is the catch: matchmaking SUX.\nLets start that base decks are crap. They really are. You can win against your own level, but against the guy who unlocked cards and build in the synegy for his play - you are just a punching bag. You really need that enemy RNG to really SUCK to get a victory. The worst part is your RNG will just give same decked out oponent over and over and over and OVER  again. Same decked out guy, The one you have snowball chance in hell to beat. Today out of 8 games i haf 7 of them against the same guy . Ain't that fun?\n\nMy recomendation - unless you are willing to drop ♥♥♥♥♥on of money to unlock cards to be competitive - pass on this game for now. It is inballanced for newcommers, matchmaking pits you against people who unlocked all decks. Maybe when they fix those global problems it will be worth paying attention to.","February 20","false","3.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Personally I was hoping for more depth, but nahh didn't really float my boat. Main thing I dislike about it is that there is no campaign mode really besides a couple of battles at the beginning just to guide you through how to play. There was no in depth guide as to how hero abilities correspond to ability cards and I know it's lazy that I don't read the forum, but the game should do better with details.

Do I recommend it? Yes and no: the game is in early access, so whatever I say now might become irrelevant in a week or so. If you're looking for a finished product or want to invest money into a hobby, you probably won't be interested in an unfinished title in the first place. However, if you're more adventurous, this might be worth a look.\n\nEarly access or not, the direction here is obvious from the outset. This is a Hearthstone clone. It might sound a bit rough, but that's essentially what it is - not a "Hearthstone-style" or a "Hearthstone-inspired" game - a straight and honest clone. And that, I think, is not necessarily a bad thing.\nI've played absurd amounts of Hearthstone in the past, probably more than I should have. And I have no regrets about it, it's a great game and it's popular for a reason. But eventually I stopped, and so did many people, because it has some glaring, hard-to-ignore issues: unhealthy meta, boring ranking system and stubborn, corporate customer support just to name a few. What started as a great CCG with seemingly limitless potential gradually devolved into a braindead netdecking grind. And most of those problems, I think, stem from the fact that Hearthstone has gone effectively uncontested for too long.\nSo this is where Star Crusade comes in. It copies Hearthstone at the very basics, card-for-card, system-for-system. Even the card stats are mostly the same. And I can see the potential benefit from this strategy. Star Crusade promises Hearthstone veterans a fresh start and could be less intimidating for new players. Plus, the devs seem to be adding new concepts to the game and attempting to fix some of Hearthstone's most obvious mistakes.\n\nThe way I see it, this experiment could go both ways. If they manage to take the initial concept of Hearthstone in a whole new direction (Space is a good place to start, no doubt), this could be a big win - especially with a few improvements on the business model. However, if they stick to the source material too much, I don't see why anyone should choose a carbon copy over the original, unless they really prefer space ships over orcs. If the game doesn't evolve into something completely different, it will simply repeat Hearthstone's mistakes, and we'll have two netdeck-dominated grindfests instead of one.\nAlso, Hearthstone didn't earn all that credit on gameplay alone. It has some hugely impressive art direction going for it, and, in all honesty, I think in many cases it wins people over more than the game itself. Plus, it has all the richness and familiarity of Warcraft lore. If Star Crusade is to succed at all, the art team will have to topple that. At the moment most of the cards in Star Crusade are well-voiced but visually uninteresting, everything is mostly grey and navy blue, and the factions look very similar to each other. I'm afraid they will have to do better than this. But hey, it's too early to pass judgement on the looks. All I'm saying is, this is an area that needs a lot of improving.\n\nAs for now, I'll give this game a thumbs up just because I think it's about time someone attempts to give Hearthstone a run for its money. Let's see what happens next.","March 23","true","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Some of the cards are also painfully unbalance, making some games very frustrating. From a game-play perspective, it's also disappointing that Star Crusade doesn't have an innovative mechanic to differentiate itself from it's competition. This makes it more like a clone than it's own card game.\n\nAs of this review, I haven't had the chance to play the Raid mode, so I can't really comment on it.\n\nI believe that Star Crusade can do well in the card game genre, but it will need to improve it's game-play in a way that would motivate people to try it without comparing it to Hearthstone or the upcoming Elder Scrolls: Legends.\n\nI wish the Devs the best of luck, but right now, I can't recommend Star Crusade over it's competitor.","May 5","false","8.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

To my point there are six factions in the game and you start only being able to play one of them, even though you have starter decks for each faction.  The only way to unlock a new faction for playability it seems is to defeat an opposing deck, which is all well and good until you run into the BS psychic decks.\n\n-Additionally there are just things that do not make sense, and again because of a lack of proper tutorial they are even more infuriating.  Specifically why units that do not have attack cannot attack anyways.\n\n-Also the arbitrary rule that you can only have X number of units on the field, I believe seven or eight.\n\n*To the devs who I highly doubt will ever read this:  you need to balance out the psychics, you need to make it so that units with no attack (read 0 attack value) can still attack inorder to be able to sacrafice themselves so you can clear you own board, or remove the arbitary unit on the ground limit.  Additionally you should also add in a better tutorial that explains more of how to unlock your other factions or just have them unlocked from the start.\n\nLast thoughts Spellweaver is probably the best pure old school style CCG out there right now, it both plays and feels like a table top card game and it is easy to be a free player and still get all the cards.  Hex would probably be the best New school style CCG.  How I define the difference between the two games is new school uses random token generation and random number values in card effects, and old school does not do any of that, it follows the rules of what you could do if you were playing with someone in person.\n\nI now uninstall this, good luck with you game.","May 21","false","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Blandness and simplistic card interactions, along with the dumbing down of the genre to make it more accessible ($$$) has turned these games into gambling more than skill or knowledge based. If they need a fancy 3D graphical background to cover up the boringness and lack of originality, then you really shouldn't expect much from these guys. Games like Infinity Wars and Duelyst provide a more fun and enjoyable experience than this ever will.\n\n"The game focuses on fast paced, accessible strategic combat with countless card and deck combinations as well as unique faction specific tactics. We thought hard about the card game we want to play but most importantly, we want to build a community-centered and powered, ever-evolving game focused around interesting player choices. "\n\nObviously these guys can't count very high and the last sentence simply means that they will nerf any overpowered and overused cards that players constantly use to win.","December 16, 2015","false","0.5"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","9","20","0","0"

Too many of the same rules apply. You basically race to be the first player to knock the enemy's HP down to zero. However, I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt as I can see some differences in their gameplay. If I were to score them from 1-100, they would get 50-60 marks, barely passing because they copied too much from Hearthstone. Packs of 50 cost $62.29 and each pack has 6 cards (300 random cards). The price is kind of unaffordable for an online game that doesn't need to worry about shipping costs.\n\nPROS\n1. Cool Sounding Names\nHajirog, Annuranki\n\n2. Modules\nThe commander abilities can be swapped out with modules allowing you to change their abilities.\n\n3. Non-Hearthstone Abilities\nThe abilities are not unique but at least I don't see them in Hearthstone which is where the developers primarily copy from.\n\nSoak: Your units take 2 less damage\nHero Ability Mutate: Units take 1 damage and gain 2 attack\n\n4. Interesting Storyline\nThe story is pretty good and is reminescent of a game called Twilight Imperium.\n\n5. Energy\nInteresting idea. It prevents games from dragging on for too long.\n\n6. Turn order token\nWell done. It's much better than Hearthstone's End Turn flip.\n\nCONS\n1. Pay To Win\nTotally forgot that a CCG is always P2W.\n\n2. Ripoffs from Hearthstone\na. Number of cards in Deck = 25-40\nb. First Player draws 3, Second Player draws 4 and gets an Initiative card (Same as Crystal in Hearthstone)\nc. Hajirog Thrash = Mage Firebolt (Deal 1 Damage for 2 Mana)\nd. Terran Rally = Paladin Reinforce (Summon a 1/1)\ne. Hierachy Nanite Conversion = Priest Heal (Recover 2 HP)\nf. Stacking limit of 2 of a card per deck\ng. Credit: You pay for the card next turn.(Similar to Overload)\n\n3. No Trading of Cards\nYour cards are virtual so they have no secondary market value. This ensures that Rare, Uncommon, Common and Legendary are meaningless.\n\nHowever, they have no secondary market to trade cards. This ensures that players are unable to find the cards that they severely lack for cheap. Fusion mode might sound great but you need to sacrifice many cards to make 1 card you need.\n\nIf you are worried about multiple accounts focusing all the cards to 1 account, you can track the cards with a trade log to find account spammers.\n\nNEUTRAL\n1. 2-Player Limit\nSadly, all CCGs seem to be unable to play more than 2.","March 16","false","1.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

That being said, unless they are planning a major overhaul-- which I assume isn't the case this close to launch-- there are severe inherant balance issues that are intrinsic to the game in its current state.\n\nThe largest detriment here is the steamroll effect. As anyone knows, a well balanced game always has a chance-- even if its small-- to comeback from behind. It is non-existent in this game. There is an illusion of coming back, but it's entirely up to chance and not to strategy. Once one player starts steamrolling, the opponent has literally zero chance of coming back unless the winner just starts drawing nothing. There's no chance for the loser to come back with the cards they have, the only way is for the winner to just start losing. That's it. So most games are won within the first 4-5 turns but still have to played out. As an avid CCG fan, I should feel like the chances are based on what's in my deck, not what the opponent draws. This even makes winning a bore.\n\nThe other large detriment is yet another money grab game. I've played for about 7 hours and still was only able to get enough credits to open 3-4 packs of cards. On top of that, I only got 2 or 3 of those cards that are actually compatible with my deck. It is painfully obvious the only way to get anything is paying real money. If you want us to give you money, just make us buy the game. Developers need to stop giving the illusion that a f2p game can have any chance against paid users.\n\nThere are elements of a good game hidden here: aesthetic, hero abilities, easy format, and good combos. Unfortunately they are far too weak and everything else cripples them.\n\nI would say wait until the actual release but there aren't any kinks to be worked out, there's just hemorrhaging gashes that turn this game into yet another pay to win.","May 2","false","7.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It's surface/volume ratio is larger than the cube's ratio, so poor future manufacturers will have to spend more resources per storage volume. Hexxagonal prism has better ratio than the cube's, but they have problem with the edges. But this is not the problem, the problev is triangle frame around a number on every card make it harder to read. This is obviously bad design decision. And to add to that, the number is much smaller than in a HS, so it even more hard to read. And there are lots of those graphic design problems in this game.\nRotating planet in background... Why is it out there? It just messes with my eyes, distracting me from reading those very little little attack, hp and manacost numbers.\nPlaying this game is HARD.\n\n"Rich styled univers" - I doubt it, I think it is pretty cliche.\n\nToo much gameplay mechanics are taken from HS, so that actual difference becomes not so important. Soak? Mutate? Armor? Eh, whatever. I have a coin (a triangle supply crate, sorry), a mana (crate) per turn, not more 2 same cards per deck and not more than one same paragon ("legendary") cards? It's just a HS with different (poor) skin and different benefactor.\n\nHere is an example of a card game that really thinks how to find A NEW WAY to play cards with minions and spells\nhttp://www.sirlin.net/codex/\n\nSome positive side.\nThis game has some notably new idea - Constructed deck is from 25 to 40 cards, and your starting HP is equal to that number. It is interesting where will this decision take the meta. But this doesn't change overall result.","February 22","false","1.1"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","1"

But that doesn't mean it's a bad game, as almost every game is influenced by something that already exists. Same as if you were to think up your own game in your own head, you may actually have some parts of it influenced or inspired from many different types of games you have played in the past that you liked.\n\nHearthstone is a good game, and I get a good feeling from playing it. Star Crusade almost feels the same as Hearthstone, but in a good kind of way. But that doesn't mean I'd choose it over Hearthstone.\n\nPretty sure the creators of Star Crusade actually like the game Hearthstone and have good compliments for it. Honestly I'd feel flattered if I created a game and everyone in the whole world were inspired from my original ideas and tried to make their own games in the similar genre.\n\n____\n\nStar Crusade, simple good game that seems to be made from inspiration.

Just like hearthstone you've got neutral and class cards and the neatral cards are only creatures while the class cards have spells as well. Why copy even that little detail?

There are a few factions you can use to build your deck,  a few game modes to play. Overall its pretty standard stuff. I am having trouble thinking of a way to put into words what I like about Star Crusade, The gameplay is smooth and simple its an easy game to pick up but I feel like there is a good deal of depth to it. The different factions play pretty differently, building up forces with one faction, or mutating your cards into new things with another, all six factions have a unique gimmick like that.

I no longer recommend hearthstone to new players since it is not new player friendly after so many expansions, adventure wings, and the fact that losses (which ne wplayers will stack) do not helpprogress toward new free packs which holds them back alot.  if you were considering trying out hearthstone, I suggest this one as you'll be on a more even playing field since it's still in open beta and most people are fresh. it beats being farmed by low rank farmers and mmr abusers iin hearthstone, which i am one of myself. (blame bliizard)\n\nthere are some interesting mechanics like the deck count also being your healthpool, and being anywhere from 25 to 40 cards in size form what i read on a post.  that allows for some risk and reward experimenting with larger deck comps. I noticed a 'soak' mechanic in tut that may wind up becoming a pita or may turn out to be comparable to the 'bubbles' in hearthstone after I play a bit more.\n\nI recommend this over hearthstone (for new players) since it is similar enough but you won't be facing legendaries left and right within a dozen matches in i am going to assume, or be forced to spend money on certain adventure wings to have a snowballs chance of winning with anything but a facehunter (and including those for the creepers). the level playing field makes this the better game to start fresh in.","December 18, 2015","true","1.3"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

So what do I mean by that? Well the game literally steals all the mechanics of Hearthstone from the mana to the heroes (even the way of communication via the portrait...) and then just puts a sci fi skin or name on and calling it a day. The only difference between this game and Hearthstone is the fact that Hearthstone has way more players. So what is the point of playing this? To crush noobs of course. I really can't think of any other reason to chose this except maybe if you hate the Warcraft franchise.\n\nAlso in case you were wondering quests in this game can only be completed vs real players so there's no reason for you to choose this over Hearthstone.","December 18, 2015","true","1.0"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","5","15","0","0"

Pretty interesting.\n\nThe only problem?  Why play this instead of hearthstone?  It's in space, sure, but what competitive edge does it have over the most obvious competitior?  People played HS instead of MTG because it was easier to get into, more convinient, more casual and simpler.  Oh well, if you've played a ton of HS and want to try something fresh, definitely give it a shot.  If you're wondering, almost all the mechanics have similar things they relate to in HS.

What's not to like?\n\nInevitably people will call this a reskinned Hearthstone.  Although they obviously iterated their designed off of what Blizzard did, I think Star Crusade is more fun.  There's a lot of additional complexity with deck building thanks to the Hero Module system.  Far more faction specific mechanics to actually make the faction choices matter.  Lastly, I haven't felt this INSANE randomness reliance that Hearthstone has.\n\nIt doesn't feel like you're losing games on a 50/50 coin toss, but rather on the strength of your deck and your piloting of it.\n\nI also really like the idea of being able to adjust my health pool through my deck size, punishing aggressive decks for their consistency.","May 8","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
