However, it has a simple and slow gameplay with really boring missions.Iron Sky: Invasion isn't a bad game. There is a chance, that some fans of space flights and fights will enjoy it. But you need to remember, that it's a simple game that looks more like a complex indie game and if not for the movie tie-in, no one would have heard about it. The politics plays no part in the gameplay, the fights are slow and have a bad difficulty balance. A good idea is not enough to make an interesting game.I'm sure there are Iron Sky fans who will enjoy this game but if you like complex, tactical space battles, Iron Sky Invasion is not the right game for you.

The whole of the game took a fair portion of the latter half of the film - basically the entire space fight and Earth fleet reinforcement segment - and stretched it out without making it boring. The tone of black comedy and "just run with it" silliness from the movie is preserved, from the mission briefings with Madame President Totally-Not-Sarah-Palin, to the political shenanigans of the various national representatives, to the over-the-top voice acting from the various pilots in the fleet.\n\nThe controls are keyboard-and-mouse, primarily mouse oriented. On screen contextual tips do show up from time to time, which can help if you go a long time between having to use a specific feature of the ship. The learning curve for controlling the ships is very short. There are some technical problems - while I haven't noticed any crashes or freezes, it doesn't like my graphics card and the mission briefing videos lag the entire game as often as not. They can be skipped with no penalty and watched later, it's just distracting.\n\nUnfortunately, once the tutorial is over, the difficulty curve spikes pretty hard; it's all but impossible for a new player to know what to do and how to do it. There's a certain amount of flexibility - if a squadron of Nazi ships makes it to earth it just applies a penalty to reputation, which is a score by any other name - but there's no option to turn down or postpone side missions, they get added to your to-do list automatically when you head to a friendly station for resupply and repairs. When you're running all over near earth orbit trying to play space tag with the Fourth Reich, something's gotta give. That said, you can buy yourself time to fight the smaller fighters and do side missions by taking out the engines in the big ships, leaving them adrift - but the only mention of this strategy comes up once during the tutorial on sub-system targets. It's very easy to miss.\n\nHaving said all that, if you liked the movie, you'll probably like the game. And even if you didn't like the movie, you might still like the game. After all, it's a game that lets you fight Space Nazis. I'll repeat that: You get to fight Nazis. In Space. And who can honestly say they never wanted to do that?","May 12, 2014","true","9.8"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","0"

More on that later.\n\nIf all of the following conditions are true, you will have a great time with this game:\n\n1. You have enjoyed Space Combat Sims such as X-Wing, Tachyon or Wing Commander\n2. You have an X-Box controller\n3. You do NOT have a flight stick (Caveot: See end of review)\n4. You grab it while the price is discounted\n5. You do not mind that it uses 3rd party DRM "Reality Pump"\n\nIf you have a flight stick you will face-palm at the missed opportunity and this will probably erode your fun factor of the game.\n\nThe game's control set up is optimized for a 360 controller, or any controller that is XInput-compatible such as the Logitech F310.  Many features are logically crammed into the little controller.  No keyboard use required.  It feels like this game was designed from the ground up to give some arcadey space-combat fun to gamers who do not have a flight stick.  Marksman-like accuracy is not required.  If the target is "close enough" to your crosshairs, you will hit it.  No sweat.  The emphasis leans more towards management of your shields, weapon energy and missiles.  -as well as making sure you are at the right place at the right time.  When you are up against larger capital ships and targeting their various sub-systems, feel free to wail on them with your missiles.  Don't worry, when you run dry one of your allies will thoughtfully drop a box of missiles for you to pick up.  Did I mention arcadey fun?\n\nThe game has a 2D map of the zone of space you will play in.  Pick a location then warp to it.  This reminded me of Star Raiders on the Atari 8-bit computers.  Whoops.. Just dated myself.\n\nThe game is based on the movie "Iron Sky."  It is about Nazis from the moon who invade Earth.  I did not see it, but I would like to.  And yes, it is as tongue-in-cheek as it sounds.  The game has "FMV cutscenes" (remember them?).  The production values are small and the quality of acting varies.  Fortunately, the voice of the main character you control is well-acted and likeable.  The quips he makes when taking out a baddie will never make you cringe.  The graphics are quite good for a lower-budget title.  The outer-space skybox is very pretty.  I don't expect to see much variety in the environment as this is about nazis from the MOON who invade EARTH.. Not too much variety of scenery between these two locations.  I wouldn't expect the game to venture too far from this area either.\n\nI don't know if I will continue the game any time soon.  Why did I stop playing it?  Two reasons:\n\n1. At the very end of the 2nd chapter I hit a game-breaking bug.  Reading in the forums I found that other people have experienced this same glitch.  Sometimes playing the entire 2nd chapter again from the start resolves the issue.\n\n2. I got myself a new flight stick and this game doesn't support it.  Makes it difficult to muster the will to play this right now when I could be bringing hot plasma death to my digital enemies in other space combat games that rightfully DO support flight sticks.\n\nHaving said that, I still recommend the game for everyone who meets all of the conditions stated at the start of this review.  You'll have a great time and if the game glitches out remember; you only spent a couple of bucks on it! :)\n\nEDIT: X360ce Vibmod will let you map your flight stick axis to the XBox 360 control axis.  I just tried it and it works!  So there is hope for games like these where the developer wants to force you to use one type of controller.  Check out a YouTube video on it here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUAhkrZKsVs\n\nMake sure you get the latest version.  The one linked in that video is older and did not work so well for me.","August 2, 2015","true","5.6"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","29","34","0","0"

The biggest flaw by far is the controls. Keyboard and mouse is next to unplayable, no joystick support (although I couldn't test it myself), but an Xbox controller makes it pretty fun. They're also mostly unconfigurable (you can invert the Y-axis, but not remap buttons).\n\nThe game's two other main flaws sort of exist in a delicate balance. They don't introduce many new mechanics outside of newer, larger enemies, but at the same time it's short enough (the campaign kept moving, but the ending felt sudden and rushed) that I didn't get tired of it until I was trying to get through the DLC. Same goes for the music. There aren't a lot of tracks, but it's short enough that they didn't repeat enough to be annoying.\n\nThere are many ships you can play with (some are forced in missions), but upgrades are stuck in the ship you buy them for, so you'll probably be sticking with one ship for almost the whole time. This is a minor flaw, combined with how the upgrades are purely better numbers. Having upgrades that actually change the ships be purchasable (or just the different ships having a real variety of features) would've made it a lot more fun. The actual designs of ships and stations are pretty nice, just like they were in the movie (the cutscenes are practically out of the movie too).\n\nFor a movie game, it's exceptional. Flying was fun, and for the $2.49 I paid, I expected a lot less than I got. I have to give the game credit for its scale, too. When a mission told me there was a 3 mile wide asteroid, I expected it to be just a slightly larger version of the normal ones, but instead they genuinely made me feel tiny next to the thing.\n\n\n\nThe DLC isn't really worth it. One is a more hectic version of a campaign map where you command the other nation's fleets. It's not bad, but it doesn't give you any indication of progress (I was playing for an hour and no end was in sight, so it might be endless). The other lets you play as one of the enemy ships, tasked with fighting the other side of a battle, where you have to hold out for 20 minutes. They're both nice new gamemodes to have, but even for the tiny price I paid, I'd expect something more.\n","August 4, 2015","true","0.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","3"

However, nothing about it is worth full price.\n\nIt's a fairly casual shooter with auto-aim and generic mission types.  It was designed to be a fully cross platform iOS/Android/PC release and it shows though it's quite acceptable graphically, being pulled up by the usage of assets from the movie such as the soundtrack, ship models, cinematics and live actors.\n\nIt has live action mission briefings which are acceptably corny in that Westwood Studios way.\n\nDespite it having auto-aim, they manage to make the combat intense at times due to the number of enemies and incoming missiles you need to accelerate away from or dodge.\n\nIt lets you redistribute energy to your shields, engines or weapons, which adds a nice layer to the combat.\n\nCollecting salvage in order to buy upgrades is a central aspect of the game and becomes more interesting as salvage only remains in space for a short time, so you often want to use your booster to get there faster.  This can make you give up shield or weapon energy to redistribute it to engines to collect salvage, increasing the risks in combat for a time.  A catchy mechanic.\nThe keyboard/mouse controls are supposedly pretty bad, but I never tried them.  It plays ok with a 360 controller, though aiming is a little sensitive.\n\nThe Second Fleet DLC doesn't really add anything of value to the game, so there's no reason to get it.  Meteorblitzkrieg is 20 minutes long and not bad for the 74 cents it cost, so if you still want 20 minutes more then there it is.","July 10, 2014","true","9.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

Other than that the price is too big for this simple shoot em up in space game. It has nice graphics, but nothing spectacular. The humour and actors from the movie, but maybe too much humour (Madam President is annoying as hell :)). Nice acting, though all storyline is presented in a small video chat window at the top of the screen. It's ok though for a game costing a few bucks, not 20. One bad thing about dialogs is that they often run during the combat, so you can't really concentrate on them. And nazi general speaks German and there are only subtitles translating it. So you have to shoot enemies and read the text at the same time. Bad, bad design. Dialogs should be out of battles or battles should pause or something. Gameplay becomes repetitive fairly quickly, though sometimes you have to defend or capture something, but most of the time you have to blast enemies. There are several types of enemies, some are tougher. Some require to shoot at the right moment (like Zeppelins, you should shoot into opened docks, but they stay open for such a short time..). There is some strategy to the game, as you should first destroy all the smaller annoying ships, before going for the big ones. You should watch your shields and energy and transfer energy to shields, weapons or engine according to the situation. But if playing carefully you probably will never die. Even if you do, you will go back to the latest save (every major space jump creates auto save). You are also allowed to change ships sometimes and buy upgrades. Other ships are interesting and have different purposes, like Canadian bomber carrying nukes to destroy asteroids, but most of the time you will fly Dundee australian bomber. Another annoying part is that you have to gather salvages of the blasted enemies to sell them to buy upgrades. You blow the ship, you fly to collect the salvage and you do these hundreds of times.. Well, at least there is an achievement to collect 500 scraps and buy all the upgrades for a few ships. All achievements are rather easy (just don't forget to visit all the stations to get all the side missions), but one should try to get them on the first run collecting as many money, kills and salvages as possible, because trying to replay chapters after completing the game will make achievements glitch and not register.\n\nAll in all, i was pleased with the recreation of the atmosphere of the movie (music, characters, space combats). Last mission was too simple, short and a bit awkward (to fly inside the big ship). The ending was shallow. But it was fun, short game, which doesn't require much skill. For the price i got it i'm satisfyed, and maybe even try some of the DLCs. One of them let you fight for the Moon nazis, and another one even introduces RTS elements of commaning the fleet.\n\nP.S. one can always try a demo to get an impression.\n\nUpdate: don't buy DLCs, they are total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t..","April 13, 2014","true","18.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","4"

Second the space combat feels very much like it was inspired by freespace...though very watered down. If anythign I have to say this game only has two real flaws 1. many of the side missions given will appear randomly and are timed with no way to re attempt them with out replaying hte chapter. and 2, this game is insanely easy. As long as you are in range and kinda sorta pointed in the right direction you will hit your target. Other then that, See the movie first, expect horible silly story, embrace its intentionaly awful nature. This game is just meant for silly fun and is a decent reminder of the space combat games of old. Seriously all the guts for a great Freespace style game are here, it just needs to be polished the right way. Oh, and pretty much just ignore the game bullet points on the store front, most of it is prettty much either wrong, misleading, or exageration.","November 11, 2014","true","3.8"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","0"

I have used a controller for a majority of my playthrough, and have entered this game without watching the movie.\n\nLet me start with the postive-\n1> The graphics are subpar to good; they look 2012-2013ish with decent lighting effects.\n2> Some of the charachters such as the Indian diplomat are memorable and funny\n3> When used with a XBOX360 controller, the game handles itself very well\n\nHere are why I cannot recommend the game-\n\n1> Like others have pointed out, this game gets very repetitive very fast- there are barely 4 enemy types, and there is no introduction of any new mechanics after the tutorial itself. Sure, you get to fly a ship with nukes, but they can only be used on asteroids; and even if an enemy is RIGHT next to the asteroid, it takes ZERO damage with the nuke explosion (you get this ship for only one mission, and the ship is pretty bad compared to the regular ones, you have NO reason to use it)\n\n2> The ships cannot be upgraded in a meaningful way or in a way that would impact how you play the game. Your weapon upgrades essentially deal more damage, but you cannot pick buy any more weapons other than the 4 default ones- 2 types of lasers and 2 types of missles. There is a distinct lack of an ingame economy, and aside from 2 missions of 5 minutes each, you have only two ships to chose from. A multi target missle system would be welcome, considering that you have to engage each enemy one at a time, and in a level with over 30 enemies, it can get cumbersome. Moreso, the ships have no special abilities, and aside from cosmetic differences, the only other difference between your main ships are hull and speed tradeoffs.\n\n3> The pacing is awful, the first one hour were very enjotyable with plenty of videos and dialogue, after which things crawled to you essentially receiving a notification that you have a new mission with a distinct lack of dialogue; this combined with the limited ship variery and limited enemy types made the game repetitive and boring.\n\n4> The way how the game mechanics work-\na>when you destroy a ship, you get scraps which is converted to money at a space station which you then use to buy things- the scraps fall 5 seconds after you destroy the enemy ship since the fireball of the ship needs to explore- if you are darting through an enemy fleet, you need to take another round to get the scrap, assuming the short timer before the scrap explodes doesn't tick out. There are no abilities to attract or auto collect the scrap.\nb> For all the weapons to get a kill efficiently, you need to target an enemy- the game doesn't select the enemy closest to you or the one nearest to your reticule, but rather cycles through each enemy; this means if you have a zepplin with its dock doors open, and you need to quickly get a missle in it to damage the ship; you need to press that next button an infinite number of times before the zepplin is selected, by which time the doors would have closed\nc> The game relies on a small text notification at the end of your screen to notify you of mission critial information such as whether a zepplins doors are open or not, or in the tutorial for buttons; I found it easy to ignore that and not know when an event was happening; a more noticable place would be nice; or a flash across the screen or something more visually noticable.\n\n5> The game is unplayable with a keyboard and mouse; the defaut bindings are very awkward to play with, and the mouse has some weird slowing down after I stop moving it; it feels much more refined with a controller.\n\n6> The story is very nice initally, but midway, it gets boring, and the ending is just awful- if you are playing this for the story, don't- it's very threadbare to non-existent, and the ending really ruins it; you have a 15 second video  after a 5-6 hour playhtorugh.","August 18, 2015","false","21.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","11","16","2","1"

Of note, the Nazi invaders DO speak full German, but there are subtitles to help those who do not speak German. 9/10\n\nGameplay Overall:  Fun, hectic, and full of accentuated international battle-chatter, with intense b***s-to-the-wall dogfighting. 10/10\n\nGraphics/FX:  Great for a game of this size ( under 1 Gig even with all the DLC O.O  ) and the larger enemy Capital Ships take dynamic damage to engines, turrets, hangars, and, when aforementioned component(s) are eviscerated, leave behind nice sized chunks that will rip apart any unaware pilots, be it AI, or the more likely Player. 8/10\n\n\n","July 10, 2014","true","1.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Gamepad required, definitely.  The FMV scenes are hokey but fit the tone of the film, I tend to skip them.  I like that the enemy armadas move on the game map in real time, meaning you have to make quick decisions about what to attack and when.  Diverting power to shields and weapons also makes the combat a bit more interesting.  Graphically the game is quite nice to look at, backgrounds rotate and scale really smoothly, reminding me of late 90s space shooters like like Colony Wars.

Its pretty easy to learn and ship controls aren't overly complicated\n+ The graphics are good - the spaceships look pretty and overall gives the feel of a professional title\n+ Who doesn't like humor - like the film, the game is satirical and funny, although don't expect the same quality of acting as the film\n\nCons:\n- Mouse control is bad - it lacks the fluidity of games like freelancer and war thunder, so you won't get the same precision from the controls as you do from freelancer - maneuvering and aiming can be frustrating on occasion. Play the demo to see if you can cope with that.\n- Lacks strafing and drifting - this along with the clunky mouse controls kinda makes me think that this aspect of gameplay was perhaps an afterthought.\n- Not very challenging. What the game lacks in difficulty it makes up for in bad controls\n- The briefing videos are awkward and slow in which your character and whoever is briefing you seem to not be communicating in the same time frame - conversations like the ship designs are unorganic, and there's always that extra 2 seconds after each transmission in which the actor just stares at the camera waiting for someone to yell cut. Obviously whoever was in charge of editing the videos did not bother to cut out that bit\n- The game doesn't save after docking to a space station, it only saves every time you warp into a location.\n- No adjustable performance settings - not a big deal if you have an average rig but there is no way to perhaps lower the graphics in order to play the game on your haswell tablet - ironic considering this game is also a mobile game\n- No first person view - again not a big deal but lacking first person makes targeting a bit difficult\n\nOverall however the faults are mostly ignorable, and you can enjoy the game for its humorous missions, unique ship designs and arcadey experience, that is of course if you catch it on sale.","July 28, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(beware lots of Satirical use of ethnic stereotypes)\n- decent number of ships ( paying about 2 dollars I had very low expectations)\n- different enemy ships have different week spots on their hauls adding a bit of variety to the fighting\n- the overmap gives the game a bit of sandboxy field\n- I liked the designs of the ships very much\n\nWhat I did not like:\n- enemy variety. I remember about 6 enemy types which is not too bad for a budget title but still repetitive for 7 hours\n- lack of veriety in weapons\n- upgrade system is linear and is mostly stat increase rather than adding new unique abilities\n- game play is repetitive\n- game does not explain itself well.

I just played a little of the extra DLC senarios (Second Fleet & Meteorblitzkreig) and they kicked my butt. Pretty challenging to stay alive to victory..oh well maybe another time. I especially like the ship explosions as it feels satisfying when one is destroyed. Although the character acting during the briefing videos is really a joke, (guess it is supose to be a bit  humerous) it still seems like a decent quality game. I loved the music too at the beginning, and during the game. For the sale price at under 4 bucks for the game and DLC's, how can you go wrong. If it was 10 or 15 bucks I'd still been happy.

At it's core, it's an arcadey space shooter. You fly around in space while aimiing your cursor at painted targets. What stands out about the game is the  various, neat, little systems it incorporates. A large map covering the space between the Earth and Moon is filled with various space stations and allied ships. Enemeis are marked as well, travelling in groups. Quests dot the map and while some are critical path, others are completely optional. Ships travel in real time, meaning that while you're completing one mission, a seperate quest may have passed by, or a set of enemy ships may have made their way closer to Earth.\n\nReminiscent of X-Wing, shields, weapons and engines can draw off each other, giving combat a little depth. It's deepened as well by how you can individually target cannons or engines on ships, wearing them down in chunks instead of slowly draining them with imprecise fire. Heavier fighters have weak spots, and the game has no fixed plane, allowing you to flay around in any direction you want and line yourself up to take those weaker points.\n\nWhat drags the game down is the repetitive nature of the game. Once you know how to approach a situation, combat becomes rote as you first target the light ships then start chipping at the bigger ones. I only ran into one or two scenarios where I was genuinely engaged in executing a strategy.\n\nWhile it's novel that they used the actors from the movie for unique in-game FMVs, the acting is unbearable. It's dull and unfunny and the game's plot is lifeless as well. The mission videos are also badly timed, as it seems they were recorded at a different time than when the game's voice actor recorded his.\n\nIt's evident that someone at the development studio cared about this game, which makes it stand out a bit amongst terrible movie tie-in games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/danklordgannon/recommended/224900/","danklordgannon","danklordgannon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/danklordgannon/","1026 products in account","Iron Sky: Invasion, could be best summed up in the phrase 'wasted potential.' At it's core, it's an arcadey space shooter. You fly around in space while aimiing your cursor at painted targets. What stands out about the game is the  various, neat, little systems it incorporates. A large map covering the space between the Earth and Moon is filled with various space stations and allied ships. Enemeis are marked as well, travelling in groups. Quests dot the map and while some are critical path, others are completely optional. Ships travel in real time, meaning that while you're completing one mission, a seperate quest may have passed by, or a set of enemy ships may have made their way closer to Earth.\n\nReminiscent of X-Wing, shields, weapons and engines can draw off each other, giving combat a little depth. It's deepened as well by how you can individually target cannons or engines on ships, wearing them down in chunks instead of slowly draining them with imprecise fire. Heavier fighters have weak spots, and the game has no fixed plane, allowing you to flay around in any direction you want and line yourself up to take those weaker points.\n\nWhat drags the game down is the repetitive nature of the game. Once you know how to approach a situation, combat becomes rote as you first target the light ships then start chipping at the bigger ones. I only ran into one or two scenarios where I was genuinely engaged in executing a strategy.\n\nWhile it's novel that they used the actors from the movie for unique in-game FMVs, the acting is unbearable. It's dull and unfunny and the game's plot is lifeless as well. The mission videos are also badly timed, as it seems they were recorded at a different time than when the game's voice actor recorded his.\n\nIt's evident that someone at the development studio cared about this game, which makes it stand out a bit amongst terrible movie tie-in games. It's not enough to rescue it though. That said, I would be genuinely interested in seeing Reality Pump further develop the ideas laid down in this game; there's some genuinely talented designer(s) over there and they deserve the chance to make a great game.","November 21, 2014","false","6.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

An armada of Fourth Reich ships, built in secret at a hidden base on the moon, descends upon the Earth to rain terror and destruction.\nBut this is not done without resistance. A cadre of crack space pilots have stepped forth to defend Mother Earth from becoming the new Fatherland of this twisted regime. A lone pilot, entering the hangar to see three state-of-the-art, prototypes ships awaiting him, knows he is the only one who can save Planet Earth. It is up to him and his brothers in arms to ensure that humanity stays free of the yolk of Nazism for good and all...\n\nSet during the main conflict of the movie, “Iron Sky: Invasion” puts players in the cockpit of an advanced new starfighter, to test his or her might, flight and dogfighting skills against the forthcoming Blitzkrieg-on-high. The main objectives are to defend Earth and its space installations from enemy attacks, blast as many Nazi ships into oblivion as humanly possible, collect and skillfully manage necessary resources, and make it alive to the final confrontation… where the ultimate secret weapon of the Fourth Reich awaits those foolishly brave enough to take up the hammer and chisel of heroism and attempt to carve their names onto the tablets of history.","January 14, 2014","true","276.2"," 13 of 34 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","13","34","0","0"

In 1978, he made the National League All-Star team, finishing the season with a .242 batting average, 6 home runs, and 34 RBI in 92 games.

It's not that detailed, the missions are the typical, shoot this and that. But that is where it captured me actually. I like the simplicity of it and I guess  anything that involves space ships and shooting asteroids is always fun. The graphics is pretty decent and the soundtrack is pretty intriguing. Intriguing in the sense that they incorporated a "space-like" theme on it, throw in a couple of beats and dub step mixes. It's actually pretty decent in the ears. The missions are pretty absurd sometimes but overall it's ok, I like the simplicity. The cutscenes, well, not full cutscenes but you'll get like a comm interface where you'll get your missions from live actors are pretty well acted. Actors looks like they know the characters they are portraying and they look like they enjoyed it. The game overall is more aimed to fun and not of a space sim not saying that space sims ain't fun. If you like space ships, and shooting without getting into a simulator-ish theme. And if you're a fan of the Iron Sky movie, then this is a game you must check out.","February 22, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first time I ve played the campaign I ve earned 27/30 achievemnts, and when I ve replayed (many times) the campaign to earn the rest 3, the game is not giving them.\n\nThird: Campaign is fun just at the first time. After the second time it's boring. No different parametrs. Even enemy fleets are the same with exactly the same type of ships and exactly the same numbers. I ended having 35+ hours gameplay just because of the achievemnts bug (see above). Otherwise the game length is 5 hours for an average player.\n\nFourth: Some times the Dundee bomber becomes unavailable in the latter chapters.\n\nFifth: ALWAYS crashes on exit after a long session (usually if I have played 30+ minutes)\n\nSixth: DEAD support. And I mean it. Those guys obviusly wanted some money fast. They seem they abandoned the game. Obviously this is not good for their future plans as game developers.\n\nAs a conclusion the game is far below average. Even on 90% discount is not worth the money.","March 26, 2015","false","61.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not that detailed, the missions are the typical, shoot this and that. But that is where it captured me actually. I like the simplicity of it and I guess  anything that involves space ships and shooting asteroids is always fun. The graphics is pretty decent and the soundtrack is pretty intriguing. Intriguing in the sense that they incorporated a "space-like" theme on it, throw in a couple of beats and dub step mixes. It's actually pretty decent in the ears. The missions are pretty absurd sometimes but overall it's ok, I like the simplicity. The cutscenes, well, not full cutscenes but you'll get like a comm interface where you'll get your missions from live actors are pretty well acted. Actors looks like they know the characters they are portraying and they look like they enjoyed it. The game overall is more aimed to fun and not of a space sim not saying that space sims ain't fun. If you like space ships, and shooting without getting into a simulator-ish theme. And if you're a fan of the Iron Sky movie, then this is a game you must check out.","February 22, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is, there is a big map where you can in real time choose where to warp\nthis is fundamental, as you are expected to protect earth while completing your main objectives\nthere are side quests too, but they require you to stop by a space station (warp close to it is enough) to start the dialogue with each nation, so if you don't stop by them you'll miss out those\n\nEDIT:\nafter reading many negative reviews, let me make some points staright\n- upgrades are "expensive": well, they are at mission 1, but trust me, once you get doing missions and collecting salvage (they sell at a fairly low price, but their drop rate increases sharply in o time, and big vessels drop from 3 toup to 15, so well, there's that), there is no problem. After long battles which happen to be a mission objective you'll end up with more than enough to buy a few (maybe 4 or 5) upgrades. Considering that you have 2 "full time" ships (the rest being temporary for certain chapters), i think that's pretty fair\n\n- combat is difficult: as i said, the game is not easy enough taht you can just stay stationary and shoot enemies. It requires you to keep a good micro on your energy, and transfer energy from engines to weapons or shield or from weapons to shields, or whatever you need, all the time. If you think you got blown up "for no reason", let me iluminate you (let this be word of advice): capital ships, frigates, and some fighters shoot missiles. Some are guided, which you can dismiss with flares(kepp an eye on the count, they are limited and you need to recharge them at a station or with an ammo box). But some are not guided, and these are the most dangerous, because there is no warning that they are coming. Most of the time they will blown up most of your shield and hull, and if you happen to be in a fight with already low shields and/or hull, well, bad news my friend. Remember, always keep an eye out on capital ships BIG cannons, they do very high damage too, so you should prioritize them before attempting to destroy the rest of the subsystems","September 6, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are looking for a fun space arcade game, then this is for you.  It is well done and plays smoothly, the controls are simple and easy to learn and it is a blast to play.  It is based off of a movie but it is not required to see it unless you want background information and context of the game.  The game is relatively short, you can finish in a few hours so don't expect days long play to get through it.  The DLC is fun and adds a couple missions to extend your playtime including one that lets you play as the Nazis.

Me neither, but I was pleasantly surprised by this game. First, I'd like to say that I got a copy for only $1.99 using a coupon I received in the Steam Market. Second, upon getting a copy I learned that the game coincides with the movie "Iron Sky". I watched the movie before beginning the game in order to get a better understanding of the plot. The first few minutes were kind of bad, but once I realized it was a comedy more than anything, I was sold. So I went into the game understanding that the plot was meant to be a joke. That aside, the flight mechanics are really good (I played using a Dual Shock 4) other than my ship got stuck on the hulls of much larger ships from time to time, but only if I actually impacted the ship, and it wasn't hard to break out of. The music gets a little repetitive as there aren't that many tracks, but I tended not to notice that too much. The game's weakest point is by far the sub-par acting of the foreign diplomats during the live-action cut-scenes (again watching the movie helps). On the other hand, the game's strongest point is assaulting the space Zeppelins and other capital ships. All-in-all if you like flight simulators, killing Nazis, and can get a copy of this on sale, then it's probably worth your time.","December 8, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is great and it has everything needed for a great space shooter.\nNow what went wrong? Well, most of it.\n\nMy first problem was that my joystick did not work. What kind of dimwit skips joystick support in a space shooter??\nNow, it does have support for the Xbox controller for those of you that has one of those.\nWhat else is wrong with the game?\nWell, the acting is the worst I have ever seen in a game of movie ever, bar none. It is painful to watch.\nI was kind of hoping one actor would do something right, but alas.\nThe only thing that really shines in the game is the two cutscenes from the movie. Almost gave me goose bumps.\n\nThe only part of the game "worth" playing is the invasion, the orignial story. It is the only one that has some kind of narrative.\n\nThe two DLC:s I got with the game was not what I consider DLC at all. They are just minigames based on the game.\nThe first one lets you fight all crooks in a map and suddenly without any warning it just says "Victory" when you have killed them all.\nThe second DLC was the only one I did not finish so far and that is because the only "mission" is to survive for 20 minutes in a huge battle, well, technically it is protecting zeppelins.\n\nI got this game at a 80% sale and I still do not recommed it. Sure if you get it for 1 Euro, maybe, but there are way way better space shooters out there.\nToo bad really for I really like the story of the move and think it would be great in a game.","July 29, 2015","false","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
