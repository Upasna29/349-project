Reminds me a lot of playing Titans Quest on hardcore. I will say its not as in depth as TQ but it does a great job of keeping you entertained and always on the edge of your seat. Also you have to be a fan of RNG, as the skills and loot are based off it. Each skill seems to go to level 5, so you have to find the scrolls and craft them in order to level up your skills.\n\nBTW this is made by 2 people and I will say they are VERY involved with the community on the forums and doing a great job in putting this together. Its well worth it and I can't wait to see it as a finished product.","December 12, 2015","true","34.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","16","17","3","0"

While level layout is static, the amount of enemies and their type (i.e. champion, elite etc.) is random, making each playthrough of a level unique.  Perma death system keeps you on your toes adding a nice bit of tension to your adventures ever so deeper into the dungeon. All learned skills carry over on death, howerver any crafting recipe you have will be lost.\n\nThe devs are very active and friendly as well as the community thus far. There are a few things  in need of tweaking as others have posted, relating to ambient sounds and music etc. but overall the game is stable and in very playable condition as it stands and will only improve from here in my opinion.","December 5, 2015","true","57.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

I usually do not write reviews but as I was part of beta I feel I should put my thoughts on current state of game and where I see it going.\n\nFirst of all this game is really hard. Not unfair hard like some rogues I played but still it wont hold punches. You need to stayed focused especially at later spins(game's term for how much times you passed all levels and restarted without dying). You progress by putting points into 4 distinct stats and you gain those points by leveling up. While 4 stats may seem not too much it opens possibilities for varied builds as every point you put into something is important. For example high level abilities cost great amounts of mana so you wont be able to spam them if you didn't put big chunk of points in intelligence.\n\nThere is really great amount of abilities, categorized into 10 tiers. With 5 abilities per tier it gives nice amount of 50 distinct abilities. In current state about 70-80% of abilities are viable imho and I hope devs will manage to bring that number up before release. Abilities are nicely done graphics wise, especially abilities of higher tiers.\nThat brings us to overall graphics. I would rate it as above average, most certainly passable. I do not think that more can be expected from 2 man team. Music on the other hand is really excellent and I really enjoyed it. There is certainly room to make OST purchasable. Voice acting on the other hand varies. Most of it is good but there are some parts that need improvement, mainly main character narator between levels.\n\nNarrative is imho superbly written and while you will need to read a lot of lore books and think a little about timeline to make sense of it you will be rewarded with a tale of great depth. There is also neat secret mechanic tightly linked to the lore and whole point of those spins(hint and maybe a bit of a spoiler: Pay attention to those wisps that fly around you).\n\nI would personally like for game to be a bit faster but that's personal preference and after all that's what early access is for, to gather opinions and make game suit majority of people.\n\nI can recommend this game with certainty because after countless hours of testing it I still have desire to play it and it didn't grow boring for me. This 17h of playtime is just from latest prerelease beta which started yesterday. If you do get it, be sure to invest some time into it, lots of great stuff about this game needs to be found and game will reward you greatly if you put effort into it.","December 2, 2015","true","30.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"

The first thing I have to point out, which in itself is really enough to choose to buy this game, is that the devs are awesome! They frequent the steam forums a lot, respond to players' feedbacks, they are very friendly, polite, non-abusive and are taking all criticism properly. I got this game since day 1 as I backed them up on indiegogo, and since the start they are making everyday patches and hotfixes and are greatly improving player experience. A breath of fresh air in the dev teams department, as I've not so commonly seen such dedicated devs and overall lovely people. This in itself is enough of a reason to get the game, to support the awesome devs and help them deliver the content they intend to.\n\nBut still, you are buying the game for playing it in the first place. Well fret not. The game, although an early access title made by a devteam consisting of only two people, is coming along nicely. It is more than playable in its current early access state. First things first, the level design is unexpectedly great, considering the small devteam. The levels are very rich in detain and really help you immerse in the game. The ambient in this early state is already immersive and breathtaking, and I am sure it will only improve. The variety of enemies is also very good. You will meet quite a few different foes in your journey through the sunken horrors that have befell on your fate. The item and spell variety is not all to great, but there are still loads of spells and items, and this number will only improve.\n\nFor an indie early access title made by two people, this game is unbelievably amazing. It is well worth its price and if you are a Diablo fan, or ARPG fan in general, be sure to try it out","December 9, 2015","true","1.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taatudi/recommended/405960/","taatudi","Feikki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taatudi/","278 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR: It's not playable yet. Go play Torchlight or something.\n\nLong Story:\nOf Audio:\nThe sound work is horrible, i can still hear the static tap-tap of my footsteps. Some of the in-game narratives were goodish, but in general, they were in bad quality, and the poor acting made them seem a bit silly for such a 'hardcore' game. The game has no hit sounds/effects of any sort for the player, for example the enemy arrows just dissapper into you, which makes it really hard to tell if you are hit or not (in cae of you are shot from afar).\n\nOf Graphics:\nThe map looks nice, and the models are decent. Everything else? Complete utter poopoo. The splash at the start has worse quality than youtube videos from 2005. The intro video (which the game wants to show you every time you start the game) is ... hilarious? I can't honestly do nothing but laugh at it. And the game tries to sell itself as 'hardcore'. Well, you can't really be hardcore without the right atmosphere, which the horrible voice acting and poor intro video certainly do not set.\nThe items you equip seem to have no effecr on your appearance, which is understandable, for this is a game from small team with no time to model each item.\n\nOf The Map:\nThe levels are static, which is kind of fine, though i hope they will change this later on. Static maps really hurt replayability in these sort of games. What I don't understand is, why is there no automapping? Since the levels are static, it should be easy to implement, and I see no reason why it isn't there. (Back to this later on).\nNow, I must admit I only played the first level, which was somewhat dull. We got some prison cells, some zombies wandering(not) around, etc etc. The typical rpg dungeon settings. The first level seemed lacking, as because of the horrible voice acting i could not follow the story (had to consentrate not to giggle and cringe). It was just a bunch of rooms thrown together.\nThe boss of the first level was. well, 'lacking', so to speak. The combat was closer to point and click then actual arpg combat, for the boss only seemed to have 2 spells; one which was AoE that hit basicly the whole room, doing little damage (so easy to soak, no reason to stop hitting/move away), and some sort of curse(?) or likes, that cast a kinda nice looking effect on the player, making them unable to move (but could still hit the boss), and after a period of time, inflicted some damage. There seemed to be no way to play around these spells, so the bossfight was pure dps race.\n\nThe Combat:\nI really like combat, like, really. When i play a ARPG game i expect fell-refined combat system with multiple ways to aproach the fight, that supports different playstyles, and suchs. Now, the combat in Sunken is pretty much point and click. Press 1 for damage, left-click when OOM, and Q for heal. The game decides not to explain the combat system in anyway, which could be another failed attempt to make the game feel 'hardcore'. Even the first bossfight was a dull DPS race. During my second run on the first level, i found 2 spells, so there seems to be some spellcasting system in place. However, the damage of spells is static, and spellcasting is limited by a) mana b) cooldown, and from my experience, there is no way to affect cooldown, so it's the limiting factor. With static damage and static cooldowns, going for caster type doesn't seem reasonable.\n\nThe Character:\nYou get experience points from killing monsters. You level up when you receive enough experience. Each time you level up, you get 5 'points' you can assign to attributes. Each attribute does something 'Each click', which seems to be a ARPG term i do not know, but I assume they meant by attribute level. Dexterity, for example, improves armor by 0.5, and crit chance by 0.1%. You start with 10 points in each attribute, so for example to max out crit chancem you have to be level 190, and by then you have 100% crit chance, meaning your attacks do 150% damage. Sounds rad, right? I haven't played long enough to actually confirm this, but this is what the game tells me when i first choose which attribute i want to level. I'll most likely write a full analyzis on how much each attribute affects gameplay later on.\n\nThe 'Hardcore':\nThis game aims to be 'hardcore', I like that. I like hardcore games. In fact, I'm designing a game that I'd like to call hardcore. But what makes a game hardcore? Sunkens ideology seems to be, that stripping down user experience is 'hardcore'. The lack of minimap/automapping, the lack of tutorial, or any explainations of basic game mechanics or even showing the user the keybindings (or list the buttons for the action bar thingy) seems to be their way of doing hardcore.\nFor me, hardcore is more about being punishing. The game should be hard to beat, not hard to play. Players should have to think about which their choice will be, and the game should support that. Sunkens total lack of transparency makes it really difficult for me to recommend it, as it is nowhere near 'the fun of a hardcore game'.\n\nThe Conclusion:\nIt's not ready. The developers have fallen into some pretty basic pitfalls of game design. Luckily, these can be fixed, and there is lots of material available on how to do this. here is some of my suggestions.\n\n- Remove the intro. Seriously, it's bad.\n- Add a way to skip the ingame narratives.\n- Add a tutorial. The first level could act as sort of a tutorial zone that introduses the player the mechanics. The is plently of material on this avaiable on the interwebs.\n- Add a hit effect to the player. It's the simplest things that make the combat so much better.\n- Add floating texts to combat. I want to see how much damage i did, and how much i received. Even ascii-based roguelikes have these nowadays. Easy to implement.\n- Add a way to hit while standing still, even when not aiming at any monster. Basic ARPG.\n- This game does _NOT_ need more content at this point. It needs better gameplay. Look up how to 'juice' the game. Even hardcore games require some juice to make the combat more pleasing.\n\nThat's about it. Summing it up again, this game is nowhere near the 6€ pricetag it has now, but I'm still looking up to see how it develops. So, don't buy it now, come back later :)","January 4","false","0.9"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","0"

I played only first level back than and a lot of things changed, so here are my opinions on the game now that I did go thro all the levels almost two times before getting killed.\n\nIll start with some things I think should see some more work:\n\nMusic on level 2 is too repetitive, longer loop would be nice. I turned music on or off depending on the level, since some levels have pretty good music. I can understand why someone would turn it off and not hear any of the tunes later on. Since all levels have their own music that fits the theme it would be a shame if its not heard for that reason.\n\nAnd the big problem, material disenchanting. Since there is no visual way to differ tiers except mouse hovering each one, disenchanting mats becomes a chore. And another question is, why do it? You will get lower level mats, but at this time you probably have all the skills learned and better gear. Only reason are potions, and that is not compelling enough to manage your mats for 15 mins only to get 5 hp and 5 mana pots. I ended up tossing all the mats some time after I get up to new tier.\n\nAnd yeah there are a lot of bugs and problems that people are writing about, and kudos to devs for quick response on fixing those. Just to mention a few: exit game crash bug, no support for 32bit os, some skills are not balanced properly, bad tooltips and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I like about it is the effort invested in making an interesting death and endgame mechanics that tie into lore of the game. I would not like to spoil anything in the review, but lets just say it gives you a logical reason for continuing.\nIt's not just here that the game is connected to its lore. Design of levels, their size and atmosphere, monsters that you fight, music that is playing in the background, all has it's reason, that you will understand better as you read the lore books scattered thorough the levels.\n\nCombat vise, it starts a bit slow, but as you get more mana (and you will if you didn't die and go back to lvl 1) and more skills (that persist thro death and can be improved, which makes next death just a bit more easier) you will get the opportunity to make interesting builds. If you don’t die you constantly get new skills and deciding which one to use was fun for me. Low tier skills do less dmg but cost less (and have less omph), and its the other way around for the high tier ones (although the difference in dmg is not that great and since it scales with your weapon and stats I found that all skills have use even after getting almost all the skills of the last tier). Clearing mobs around the level when you learn the best tactics for them is not a big problem, and after learning level layouts you can effectively farm them pretty quickly. Bosses are tied to the lore, and the tactics that you need to use are things that make sense. Problem I found is that its really hard to see their debuffs. Hovering over an icon to read what it does usually means my head getting smashed. But you can kill some of the bosses on muscles, which would require multiple farm runs to make possible.\n\nSound is ok, as I said loop on some of them is too short to enjoy, but then again some other levels have music that I really liked. If the devs have time and resources it would be nice to hear more of one sound for monster strikes, sword swings and so on. Voice acting for some characters is all right, but I didn't like the voice of the character that you hear in the loading screens. All of the books that you find have voice actors reading the text. And now that I’m mentioning it, it would be awesome if there was a journal containing all the books that we found.\n\nVisually its all right, I would say that worst part of it is low resolution of some assets. UI needs some improvements, I like the overall style but some things should be more visible (health and mana, mouse). Spells do look powerful, and even with full screen of monsters while casting visually taxing spells the game worked fine and frame rate was really high, maybe even way more than it needs to be (maybe frame cap it).\n\n\nSo considering the limited manpower, time and resources I believe this is a pretty good addition to the genre. Problems do exist atm, but this is early access afterall.","December 4, 2015","true","32.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ginsomniac/recommended/405960/","ginsomniac","Ginsomniac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ginsomniac/","300 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDISCLOSURE: I'm friends with one of the devs. I backed this game on Indiegogo. I've also contributed some voice acting to the game.\n\nI don't play many ARPGs. I think the last one I really put any time into was Titan Quest. I didn't really have any expectations going into playing Sunken, but I honestly quite enjoyed it.\n\nFirst off, yeah, this game feels like an Early Access title. It's rough around the edges. But saying that, it also feels like it achieves a lot of what it sets out to do. You walk around a dungeon, you click on various monsters, and they die in various ways. All the while, you step further into the labyrinth, getting more powerful spells and items, as well as ingredients for crafting those two things, which I'll get to in a minute.\n\nThe combat is pretty simplistic, but compelling in that time honoured dungeon-crawling fashion. Kill things, get more powerful, kill bigger things. It doesn't re-invent the wheel but it worked well enough to keep my interest. It starts off pretty easy, but as you encounter more powerful foes, you start having to play more strategically. I found the permadeath aspect to be one of the most compelling aspects, as it made me more cautious while playing. This really came into play when fighting the bosses, and I enjoyed having to work out an effective strategy on-the-fly without a save point to run back to if I failed. That said, the game could benefit from some sort of save system. If not a quicksave or autosave, maybe a Dark Souls style bonfire system would fit the feel of Sunken better.\n\nTalking of Dark Souls, this game barely explains anything to you. I found this both good, and bad. If you don't have patience for poor tutorial design, you probably won't enjoy this. I personally feel like it's on the verge of a good balance between explanation and experimentation, something the Dark Souls series excels at. But right now it's not really found that balance. I wasn't too put off by this, though - if you've played a game like this before, then you'll know exactly what to expect. But if you're anything like me, just be prepared to spend five minutes pointlessly clicking around to try to use the crafting system. Once I worked out I needed to find an anvil, though, it all fell into place. From what I've played so far, the system isn't particularly in-depth, but it's satisfying to use and helped add a little extra involvement to the otherwise combat-oriented gameplay.\n\nPresentation-wise, I found Sunken quite pleasing. It aims for that grim, gothic fantasy vibe and pretty much nails it. It's a Unity game, so it looks like something from 2006, but the regular introduction of scenery changes and enemy types helps to keep it visually interesting. The music is pretty good too, or at least good enough that it didn't grate on me after playing for a couple of hours. The lore texts scattered around the levels add something for people looking for a story. It's not the main focus of the game, but I think it's compelling enough to want to seek them out. I don't feel like I'm qualified to comment on the VA quality, being involved in it myself. I heard myself a couple of times and didn't think I sounded like a complete tool - I call that a personal success.\n\nLike all Early Access games, if you're not 100% confident in spending your money, don't buy Sunken. I personally feel, however, that Sunken really embodies some of the best qualities of an Early Access game - it's clearly made by people who have a passion for the genre and a dedication to making the game as good as they can. It comes through in the surprisingly robust combat, the decently-sized skill tree and the actually helpful ability descriptions. If you want to spend some time doing some old-school dungeon-raiding, and help a solid little ARPG come together, you could do a lot worse.","December 2, 2015","true","3.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Well [spoiler alert] its a little charmer, and its from two-man dev team Hit The Crow called Sunken.\n\nOk, well I've kind of given away that I like this game in the first paragraph but there are caveats to this as we shall find out as I continue............ /url]","March 24","true","18.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","5","12","2","0"

This game looks promising, I didn't even have a hint of fun yet. The loot drops leave much to be desired, also a good amount of the time I can't pick up the loot. Crafting is dry so far, as is the story. This review has nothing to do with end game, but the first 30+ minutes of the game, which I feel are important. I am already bored and unimpressed, and I am gonna find it hard to play through more content. Also the first "Boss" was absolutely uneventful and also left much to be desired.","January 26","false","0.6"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","2"

It feels like good start, but at current state it's not fun, the combat feels slow, the progression is extremely slow and most of stuff I got in first 30 or so minutes was +5% autoattack damage, +10% power attack damage, etc. Meh!","May 27","false","0.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"
