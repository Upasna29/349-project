Still, it is a good game if you can find a way to avoid all the game crashes and glitches.\n\nIt's too bad the pc port is so terrible. This is the first Splinter Cell pc game that I've had problems with. I made it halfway through the game with about 10 game crashes. Also, sometimes i run into a glitch where an invisible wall randomly appears in front of me to block my path. The safe-unlocking minigame is bugged as well. It took me a while to figure out that you have to have your movespeed set to 2 mouse-wheel ticks higher than the lowest in order to open a safe. Otherwise, the sensitivity is REAL high.\n\nIf I look past the port problems, there is a good game here. The missions provide decent environment variety. They added in a double-agent objective mechanic where you can choose what objectives to complete. Your decisions affect your trust with the Agency and the Terrorists. This is probably the most stealth-heavy title in the series so far, but it doesn't feel satisfying. Chaos Theory felt a lot better. The visuals also look worse than Chaos Theory for some reason.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think I will finish this game. I decided to quit halfway through because of all the game crashes and the inability to disable intro videos.","October 2, 2013","false","6.3"," 50 of 74 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","50","74","0","4"

Experience the thrill of editing .ini files and having the game crash on you 75% of the time when loading between levels. I was somehow able to get the game to crash when switching between weapon attachments on the tanker level. And at the very end of the storymode if you've edited the game to support 1920x1080, because it doesn't natively, it will freeze. The only way to get around this is by setting the game to a resolution that it actually supports. How the hell does it not support 1080p. What a piece of trash.\n\nChaos Theory really was the pinnacle in terms of stealth for this series. Instead of keeping the perfect light and sound meters, they decided to just completely remove the sound meter, and attach a traffic light onto Sam's back, to let you know if you're hidden or not. There are plenty of instances in this game where you should be 100% hidden, but because of the terrible lighting system they opted to use for this game, you're not. There is no absolute darkness in this game and for that reason I never found myself having to use the trademark goggles. The Stealth in Double Agent is a joke.\n\nLastly, you can look forward to suffering through a nonsensical barebones story that will leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth after it's over. In some alternate reality Ubisoft didn't hire a b-team to crap out this game and instead allowed the Chaos Theory team to port over their version of Double Agent once the 6th gen one was out. This version (the 7th gen) of Double Agent is where Splinter Cell died.

That being said, this game I had some trouble with. The controller support only goes towards official xbox controllers which sucks, I have crashed quite a bit, there have been a couple game breaking bugs, and some parts just take so many retries to do. Also the fact that it doesn't have the light meter or sound meter is disappointing. It does have many good parts to it though. The storyline is in my opinion better then Chaos Theory's, and is original. It is fun to play when it does work right. The soundtrack is simply outstanding. It is still a Splinter Cell game at heart, but with some welcoming twists. The verdict for this one is, if you look deep down inside this game to the heart, you will find a great game, but it isn't something that I would consider top-notch material. I recommend getting this one on sale or for as cheap as you can get it, because it is worth playing, but it isn't worth paying too much money for.

The game crashes almost every mission for no reason, quick saves will randomly decide to not load, the entire game just freezes during certain loading screens. Also, the game looks awful compared to previous games in the Splinter Cell franchise, which is odd, considering Chaos Theory was absolutely gorgeous for its time, and still holds up to this day. Sometimes shadows won't even render when the level loads, making the whole stealth mechanic extremely awkward. Being a huge fan of Splinter Cell, it's really unfortunate that this game is unstable, to the point of freezing my computer. I could only recommend this game to hardcore fans of the Splinter Cell franchise. I will attempt to finish this game, and if it gets better, I will edit this review. Until then, this still stands.\n\n[EDIT]\nSo I've finished the game. The bugs and glitches are still present, no suprise there, but there was one specific bug that stood out amongst others: a game breaking bug. After completing the final mission, a cutscene is supposed to play, the credits should roll, and you are rewarded with a bonus mission. For me, and many others, this didn't happen. The mission would end, and then cut immediately to an overhead scene of the level where you are unable to move and unable to quit properly. (you have to enter the Task Manager and end it manually.) Aside from the awful technical issues, the gameplay and story are some of the best in the Splinter Cell series so far. It takes place shortly after the events of Chaos Theory, in which Sam must pose as a criminal and join a terrorist force in order to destroy them from the inside. The game has a "trust meter," in which you have to complete objectives for the JBA: the terrorist force, and the NSA: the good guys. Due to trust being a factor, the game forces you to enter in these moral gray areas just to keep the trust of the enemy. While in the base, you have the option to research and spy on your allies/enemies to learn more info about them. This information will assist you in traversing the base as well as unlock special items for your missions. As with all previous games in the franchise, it is all based on stealth and using gadgets as well as the enviornment to your advantage to accomplish your objectives. If you've played a SC game in the past, you know what you're getting yourself into from a gameplay perspective.\n\nSummary: Splinter Cell: Double Agent is a fantastic game form a gameplay and story perspecrive, but it is hindered by so many techinical issues that it is not worth the purchase, at least not on the PC. I have heard that the concole version is much better, so if you would like to play this game, play it on the Xbox, PS2, or PS3.","December 31, 2013","false","9.1"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","3"

Let's start at the beginning.\n\nWhile the previous game of the franchise - Chaos Theory (yes, yes, one of the BEST stealth game of all time, however I won't go into further detail now) - got an update (1.05) to run in widescreen resolution (up to 1920*1200), this game did not, so you have to do some .ini tweaking to get the desired one.\nSince we're at tweaking, there are couple of options in the .ini which aren't even present in game (for tweaking and issue resolving I recommend this page: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Splinter_Cell:_Double_Agent ).\nEven after you've done everything in your power to make the game a bit better, the shadows frequently flicker or just outright don't appear.\nThen comes the sound: sometimes after loading the game, the game won't display a huge number of sounds (but you can still hear Sam's breathing, steps and muffled/glitched gun shots).\nThen comes the loading issue: the save system is abysmal, you have 3 spaces to choose which one you'd like to load from / save to, you can't rename your save files (maybe you can, but I got so frustrated with the menu that I'd rather used the quicksave/load option) and sometimes quicksaves just outright disappeared. This usually happened when the game crashed, I reloaded my game using the "Continue" option which did load the quicksave file, however after wanting the quickload said file, I couldn't. What?!\nI've written about the menu and how bad it is, but why you ask? Sometimes you can't navigate it with the keyboard (moreover it defaults to WASD rather then the arrow keys, but whatever), the mouse is janky and you can't use your mousewheel while browsing your save game files.\nThe OPSAT (Sam's ~infobar on his wrist during the game) is also equally bad, has all the problems just mentioned.\n\n"Okay okay, but how's the game play?" You might ask. Well I could have gotten over all of the above, if only it was good or at least not as bad as I've come to know it. One word: awful. The controls are sometimes unresponsive, Sam just doesn't want to grab that ledge or crawl into a ventilation system no matter hard you try (like he's also fed up with the whole game "Nope, not gonna do it"). More often than not you get stuck on some random object which can also lead you being discovered or just missing your chance.\n\nI might have missed some issues because there's plenty and I didn't write any of it down, all of this is just off the top of my head. A real shame though because it was a great idea executed so poorly...\n\nSo the question is: would I *recommend* the game? NO. If you like Splinter Cell, just skip it, if you're a "hardcore" SC fan, then you might, only might, want to give it a shot.","March 20, 2015","false","11.9"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","23","32","3","0"

Buy this game on any other platform and you'll have a fun time, but avoid the PC version like the devil.\n\nIn-Depth: I'll start with the game itself. It's not going to be anyones favourite Splinter Cell as, quite frankly, it's one of the more linear and demanding of the series. Gone is the option to play the game your way and still get the best score if you complete the objectives; now the game ranks you on stealth. It provides penalties to how many guards you knock out/kill, locks you break etc. Meaning you have to basically be a shadow to get the best score. This is a fair idea, but the problem is, the level often throws enemies at you you HAVE to move out the way, or you have to do something ridiculously convoluted to get them to move; which just takes up way too much time.\n\nAlso introduced is the trust system; a fine line you have to take between both the terrorists and your employers. Alot of people were kind of iffy on this, but I honestly liked the idea. The main issue stems from the fact it's completely pointless. There are enough side objectives and such that you'll honestly always have full trusts 99.9% of the time; even on hard mode where you lose trust more and gain less. If they had made it much more imperitive to the game and maybe had it so you gained rewards from having certain levels, or even something as simple as dialogue change, it might have been  a worthy addition. As it stands, it's just kind of there; a nice idea that dosen't realise it's full potential.\n\nAs for the core game, it's pretty much Chaos Theoy's mechanics again. This is fine as, in my opion, Chaos Theory really got it right when it came to the stealth aspect and design; n both games have a nice, easy to navigate ingame inventory, the layouts easy to see etc. One major gripe thought is that they changed the stealth meters; as in, they no longer exist. In Chaos Theory, they had two bars which showed your visibility and sound. This was useful as it indicated how alert enemies where sound wise and indicated clearly how sneaky you were being. In this game, you have a light, that's it. It's green when your safe, yellow when not, and red when spotted. The problem is, while it takes into account shadows and does change when enemies are more alert, it never shows how much noise your making; which can be a HUGE problem if your next to an alerted enemy and want to sneak past him QUIETLY. But, that aside, it is for all intents and purposes just more of Chaos Theory sanded down. Back handed as that is, I'm not complaining at  a few more levels.\n\nNow for the crux of the problem; the PC Port. The best summary would be 'A glitched up mess that everytime I play I find another'. The most common one is random crashes and lost autosaves, but there are weirder ones. Lost sound, not gaining your bonus equipment, a door not supposed to be there stuck in another door (Yes, that actually happened), do I need to go on? Not to mention graphically, the game just looks off. There is a guide to tweak this on steam, but the fact you HAVE to do this is pretty appaling; without the tweaks, the game looks... well, off, it's hard to explain, kinda like the world is slowly falling away pixel by pixel in the background. There are alot of things in this port that just make it dissapointing, and I really tried to look past them. But the bugs really were the final straw. Avoid the port like the devil, patches have been known to exist, but wether they work is apparently 50/50. Go buy another version of the game elsewhere; you'll be glad you did","December 20, 2014","false","10.6"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","19","25","0","0"

When you get a game you saw in a LP and which seemed good, a game even your friends and relatives told you was good, and when you finally get your hands on it, you realise it's absolutely terrible?\nWell that's my Double Agent experience for you.\n\nLet's start from the top. The game has an unskippable super long intro, one you must endure every time you boot the game, but also every time you come back to the main menu for some reason. Loading times are attrociously long for a game that old, especially seeing how good and new my computer is.\nControls are bad, especially the "new" water controls. You also no longer can grab an opponent on stairs, despite the fact you could do it in Chaos Theory, and that game was a lot older. Somehow the elevation slight difference mess up with the prompt.\nThe game is crash heavy. First I had a bug where the game automatically loaded my last save without giving me the main menu, which always crashed said game until it stopped to do that for some weird reason. Then the game crashes every single mission change. In multiple parts missions, it crashes at zone change.\n\nThe HUD that was so convenient in Chaos Theory is completly gone. The new system is too simplistic and vague and seldom helps.\n\nThe PC version smells like a terrible port. It's choke full of bugs. If your remap your keys then try to rename your profile, instead of using your normal keyboard, it will change every key you remapped to its new equivalent. For exemple if you put couch on ctrl, you will need to press ctrl to write a C, because the original key for crouch was C... The safe cracking game is horrible because it was obviously designed with a controller in mind. Not only that, but there is a crippling bug which prevents you from moving the gears if you don't raise your speed to max. On some missions, bodies will get detected even if they are hidden and there is no one to detect them. On others, you will get your stats messed up, like one mission dependant kill which will somehow count as two kills... Ennemies see you with their butts. The particuliarly huge offenders being snipers, who are similar to the ones in the very first splinter cell in terms of complete bull. It's especially obvious on some missions where you can watch a video of someone playing on hard and doing something on console, and not get seen, while you do the same thing on easy on PC and will get noticed(Shangai mission, the guard opening the vent when you're hanging from the ledge).\n\nControls are klunky and overall unresponsive. Jumping is particularly awkward, but any kind of "platforming" is terrible. You can't rename your saves, so identifying which one is which is a nightmare. Besides the system is so bad if you select a save with your mouse to overwrite, you may overwrite an other save. Only the one in the middle of the list is the one affected, even if you selected the top or bottom one. And yes, this can cause you to delete a very important save. You can no longer use the mouse to press the key on a keypad to enter the code...\n\nThe list goes on. It's like a HUGE step backward from Chaos Theory. It's just so bad I can't focus on the story... I just can't because every enjoyment I could have is ruined by thoses crippling problems. And like I said, they all seem to share the same origin: Being a terrible console port. It's just a wonderful exemple of "When Ubisoft started to really decline".\n\nThis game is pure pain, and I recommend to anyone to stay clear from it.","October 30, 2015","false","6.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

Saves are very unreliable: they either disappear or just don't work.\n\nThe stealth isn't great. The levels are rarely dark.

Sometimes you're not hidden, but there's a huge snowstorm going on and a guy on the other side of the level still raises the alarm. Especially on "Hard"-difficulty, not getting spotted is VERY strict.\n\nThe interface is ported almost straight from the console-version. The inventory and interactions are kinda slow to use, as you have to cycle through them. There is no way to bind different weapons or gadgets to keys on your keyboard. You can't just plug in a controller to play this game. One positive note: you can use the Steam Controller set to KB/M-bindings. That works pretty well.\n\nThe options in the menu are very limited. You can select "Normal" or "Next-Gen" graphics, and resolutions up to 1600x1200 pixels. Not all keybindings can be changed. The list of saves is very short, so you have to scroll a lot (and as mentioned before, the saves often don't work).\n\nThere are some good things about this game, too. The story is arguably the best part of this game. The undercover-aspect is a fresh approach which works well enough. There are some very interesting locations, and they often look well (for their age). And finally, it is more Splinter Cell.\n\nIf you are a die-hard Splinter Cell-fan, you might be interested to pick this up. But be warned that the experience might be troubled by technical difficulties or can be plain frustrating. If you're new to series or only a casual fan, check out the other games like Chaos Theory of Blacklist.\n\n=====TL;DR=====\n\n+ Story\n+ Locations\n+ Undercover\n+ Splinter Cell\n\n- Interface for controllers\n- No support for controllers\n- Unreliable saving / loading\n- Very limited menus\n- Many crashes\n- Many bugs\n- Average stealth:\n* It's barely dark\n* Enemies are super sensitive\n\nConclusion: Double Agent is a very bad port which suffers from many bugs and is often frustrating. Only get if you're a very big Splinter Cell-fan.","January 25","false","15.2"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoismatt/recommended/13580/","whoismatt","WhoIsMatt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoismatt/","521 products in account","I bought this in a steam sale with the other Splinter Cell games. After really enjoying Chaos Theory, I had very high hopes for Double Agent.\n\nThe first sign of trouble was the game did not support 1080p.  Chaos Theory from two years prior did, but Double Agent did not.  Instead, I was stuck with 720p.\n\nDouble Agent suffers from bugs and graphical issues throughout the game.  The lighting engine went from being very powerful and realistic to downright terrible.  The designers also removed fun features such as the sound meter and degrees of light.\n\nEverything has been dumbed down in this game.  To make the UI more minimal, the light meter is now green for hidden, yellow for visible, and red for spotted.  Half the time you'll be standing in total darkness and have it still be yellow.\n\nThe PC port of Double Agent also crashes horribly.  Expect it to freeze up when loading requiring you to restart your computer.  Like previous Splinter Cell games, it lets you save wherever you are in the level.  Unlike previous Splinter Cell games though, there is no way of sorting your saved games.  So expect to have to dig through all your saves when you are trying to find the one you are looking for; there is no way to sort them.\n\nLastly, the gameplay is horrendous.  Half the missions take place during the day and are better played like a first person shooter than a stealth game.  Just shoot everything, don't bother with stealth.\n\nI had high hopes for Double Agent and was sorely disappointed.  Don't buy this game!  Just read the synopsis and move on.","March 15, 2014","false","12.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

When I was younger, I was astounded at seeing Sam like never before and divulging in his world as a double agent; replaying this game allowed me to fully appreciate the detail that was put into the old Splinter Cell series. This isn’t the new Fisher with a kid’s voice and superman agility; this is Sam at his finest in a world that, in this gamer’s opinion, flawlessly assimilates secret agent movie and video game into one body. While the Steam version of this title isn’t without its programming flaws, I still respect Double Agent as the greatest Splinter Cell and honestly believe it was the first and only of its kind.\nIf anyone is on the fence about playing this game, please give it a chance and, if you do, take the time to EXPLORE EVERYTHING!

(atleast not on PC)\n\nThis game is so broken that youre not left with the choice of enjoying or hating a game, this game is ppure torture on PC!\n\nFirst of all just getting this game to run on a higher resolution and with a somewhat semi fix of the games lighting requires you to use a search engine. Once youre past this you might think the hard part is over, well think again whoever tested out this pile of trash must have done it on godmode.\n\nThe games after the lighting fix still causes problems at some spots but the biggest annoyance is no matter how you toggle the games brightness settings still cant manage to find a setting that manages to give the player a fair chance to use the games shadows. There is tons of moments where you might think youre about to enter some shadows but then the in game indicator still shows a yellow light which means youre visible, this is how you will get rekt for the most of the time.\n\nSome other bugs:\n\nAI is really bizarre, sometimes they cant see when youre in front of them after getting semi detected while at other times youre spotted from far distances in crouching position about a hallway away semi hidden between 1-2 pillars of cover. other times they will wander around like headless chickens circling a limited area just waiting to be put out of misery.\n\nDoor bugs. There is a couple times where walkign through a door is a problem, the same goes for grabbing ledges to climb and cutting fences.\n\nThe safecracking puzzles doesnt always respond to keyboard directions, i had to pick up the xbox controller 1-2 times during these to finish em.\n\nThe game crashes heavily towards the last few missions, also you cant see the games ending without reverting back to a in game menu resolution if youve have changed the config file to support a higher one than 1280x1024\n\nIn the 14 hours i used on it i had to restart the game about 50-60 times after it crashed to desktop.\n\nThere doesnt seem to be a way to disable Xbox controller vibration when using keyboard/mouse, it will start vibrating at times so its either unplug it or put it at a soft place like i had to do lol.\n\nMultiplayer did not boot up in any way, didnt have a chance to see which version of the game i had nor if it had the latest patches,atleast for the EU steam version that is i played on.\n\nTheres more bugs/problems i cant remember.\n\nThe game itself is the worst in the series up to this the 4th game i have played so far. It had some good ideas like missions taking place in the hideout of the bad guys in the game where youre undercover and decisions making a difference on how youre perceived between the good/bad guys youre working for.\nIt still feels somewhat of a barren version of the older Trilogy though, theres really no reason to use most of the gadgets in the game except for the the 2nd last mission or when a objective requires you too.\n\nThe menu system is one of the most unintuitive i have ever seen going back and forth the game is a hassle and if that wasnt bad the save system is even worse, theres not indicator besides a image of the map, due to the many game crashes it has you will save very often and finding through these saves requires almost a monocle next to you since you have to look closely at the time stamps. I couldnt use my windows watch and had to look at my phone next to me constantly to find the right save file since minimizing the game is a risk factor due to crashes/lockups.\n\n\nIf youre gonna get this game get it for some other system, i have only played the PC version even though i had heard alot of complaints about it but i preferred playign the old ones with keyboard/mouse and after finding it on a winter sale how could i go wrong ? it went so bad it turned into pure torture to play through this.\n\nPC Version: 1/10\n\nGameplay: 4/10","July 29, 2014","false","14.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

It's a very unsatisfying game. If you really want to play Double Agent, get the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube version, which was made by the Chaos Theory devs and it actually feels complete.

Very long loading screens, poor graphic options, some graphical issues (in the tutorial area the bloom was so high I couldn't distinguish walls from floor - the whole thing takes place in a assassin's-creed-like digital while room,) and the game would freeze by the end and refuse to play the final cutscene until I changed my resolution. The controls worked just fine with keyboard and mouse in previous installments but they don't work well in this one. Movement feels clunky and some minigames (like safecracking minigame) have some serious issues.\n\nThe game itself is a mixed bag. I wish Steam would have a "maybe" option for recommendations. There were quite a few frustrations. Instant failures are common and it is not always clear where can you go and were you can't. The levels are still pretty linear with a few exceptions.\n\nThe theme though. While it is still a Splinter cell game and you will sneak a lot this time you are a double-agent breaking the terrorist cells from inside. The biggest addition is the trust meter of both Terrorists and Echelon. You need to keep both factions satisfied otherwise you loose. It makes the missions more tense as you get multiple objective from both factions (often conflicting with each other) and you have to choose on fly which ones you can afford to skip. This system also rewards skilled players. For instance killing innocents will couse the Echelon to be displeased with you, therefore players ability to stay hidden and avoid contact with the enemy is rewarded.\n\nMy favourite part of the game ere the semi-sandbox levels which take place in terrorist hideout. In these the player is given a main and sideobjectives from both terrorists and echelon and has around 30 minutes to complete as many of them as possible. It is a great idea which works really well and uses Sam's stealth ability in a very organic way.\n\nSo yeah, I think it is an interesting game and it is a worth a shot when caught on sale. It does have a lot of issues though.","October 24, 2014","true","0.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Another one of Ubisofts crap buggy ports which you can buy from steam without knowing that it has tons of issues crammed into it.\n\nPersonal experiences:\n\n- UI menu's and mouse controls horrid especially on the 3d map.\n- Levels of speech between NPC's sound unbalanced on rare occassions.\n- Game crashes when trying to save the game 'RunTime' error during Shanghai level including saving on automatic checkpoint.\n- AI bug out and become unresponsive and paths become broken quite often.\n- Checkpoints to load the next part of the game sometimes do not execute. Including the completion of the final mission.\n- Intro audio to West Africa mission does not have audio, nor was there any sound effects, ambience enemies voices etc.\n- Sometimes game will crash between loading screens on missions.\n- Sometimes game will crash when trying to load a save game.\n- No support for HD resolution or AA without 3rd party mod - very dated.\n- Can't load save games from menu sometimes either, just refreshes the load menu.\n-  No ability to delete save games from the menu.\n\nDespite these issues I had fun with the game itself, it ran smooth, the ingame keyboard and mouse controls are responsive but can be a little twitchy at times. If you are really wanting to play the series and don't want to skip this one I reccomend that you download an 100% completion save game so that if there is any major issues preventing you from playing a part of a mission you could just watch the remainder of the mission on youtube then load the next chapter.","April 8, 2014","false","23.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Make no mistake, the game is certainly buggy, but if you look carefully you can find guides to help you get it running. For around $3.50 I would certainly say you should pick it up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatonedutchguy/recommended/13580/","thatonedutchguy","Darren and his Dead Computer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatonedutchguy/","172 products in account","A very average game plagued by countless, strange bugs. Yes, it's the 4th Splinter Cell and one of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest pc ports you can get on PC. Even while patched (which, for some stupid reason, you have to do yourself since the Steam version is unpatched), the game has its bugs. AI tends to mess up, though that's one of the rarer bugs. Sometimes you fall through the floor. Sometimes an objective or the like can't be finished. For some reason, I couldn't use my goggles in some missions unless I whistled first - which you know, tends to attract guards. So yeah, sometimes I had to whistle in order to turn on my friggin' night vision goggles. That's one weird bug.\n\nBugs aside, this is an average game. As far as Splinter Cell titles go, this might just be the weakest. I also suggest you read up or play the previous games since they're excellent (especially Chaos Theory), as this review is written for those familiar with the stealth series.\n\nThe story is quite interesting in setup: after a mission in Iceland, Sam Fisher receives the news his daughter has been hit by a drunk driver. In order to help his friend, his superior Lambert decides to put him on a tough undercover assignment. Weird way to have your friend deal with grief, but alright. Lambert has him send to jail so he can befriend and assist in breaking out a known terrorist sympathiser, in order to join their group and become the double agent of the title. Sam is welcomed with open arms into the JBA (John Brown's Army, the terrorists) and sent on JBA missions almost right away.\n\nAnd here we get to the main issue with the story: it's barely coherent, and barely there. So you go with your new terrorist buddy to the terrorist base... Any other game would introduce all the characters one by one, have you run around talking to people, basically set up the characters and the environment you will be spending 4 missions in (as the terrorist base acts as an inbetween mission hub). This game introduces a few characters with barely any dialogue, leads you straight to an obstacle course the terrorists want you to complete (with a timelimit!!), and to top that the NSA wants you to sneak around the base planting bugs. Calm your ♥♥♥♥ game, I just came here and barely know the place, now you want me to sneak around while the clock’s ticking? Can I at least know what this terrorist organization is all abo- OK OK I'M GOING TO TRY TO PLEASE THE JBA AND THE NSA SIMULTANEOUSLY RIGHT NOW.\n\nThe game operates on two trust meters: the NSA's and the JBA's, meaning the game has moral choices. It forces you to please both your actual employer (the NSA), and your new terrorist buddies. This means at certain moments, the game will have you choose between pleasing the JBA through EVULLLLL  and doing a nicer thing for the NSA, preventing either meter from depleting. This can lead to a few tense moments, at least one standing out, but these choices are far and few between and the lack of connection (due to lack of dialogue) to the characters means you won't give as much of a damn as you should. Also mind-boggingly stupid is that after the start of the game  Sam's daughter never ever pops up again in conversation. Why this had to be the catalyst for the game's events is beyond me.\n\nGameplay wise, it's also pretty weak. Gone are Chaos Theory's sound and shadow meters, which I had come to find a core element of the series' stealth mechanics. But no, in Double Agent you just get 3 states: invisible, visible, and spotted. There is some leniency with visible mode, as enemies far away will investigate, allowing you a stealthy retreat. But seriously, what was wrong with the stealth meter? Or the sound meter? Shadows are rather confusing: places that you'd think would give you thegreen light indicating invisibility instead make you light up like a Christmas tree and places you'd think make you stick out like a sore thumb make you invisible. The game's shadow contrasts make no sense, so there will be guesswork involved in whether a hiding place actually makes you hidden or not. As far as making sound goes, gone are masking environment sounds, and it's trial and error in finding out whether you're walking silently enough or not. It’s hit or miss with the game’s missions and moments.\n\nFurthermore, this game has more cover based sneaking than the previous titles, amplified in the game’s daylight missions. I don't necessarily find that a bad thing: the gameplay flow of shadow hunting can be tiresome, so it's nice to break it up with cover to cover based sneaking, but it doesn't always work. The mechanics are built around shadows, so in the daylight missions you're going to come across situations where in a regular cover-based stealth game you'd be hidden, whereas here they see your head sticking out from behind a box or something. Again, more frustration.\n\nWhen the game isn't just a frustrating affair with poorly defined stealth parameters, it can be fun and has its moments. It's just not up to par with Chaos Theory as it's back to trial and error gameplay, and stupid - sometimes gamebreaking - bugs can sour the experience.\n\nMultiplayer is interestingly enough, still alive, though you won’t find anyone at random unless you’re in a lobby all day. Sadly, the game doesn’t have a coop campaign like I expected the game to have, since Chaos Theory had one. No, you’ll have to make do with the competitive mode. You’ll have to reach out to those few players keeping the MP alive. Once you’re in a game, it’s actually pretty fun. Spies VS. Mercs, the stealth-multiplayer competitive mode, is pretty cool. Spies are quick, nimble, agile and blend in the shadows (but have no guns to speak of), who either have to kill all the mercs or hack all the terminals in the level and get the hell away. Mercs try to prevent this, and do so in a first person mode with guns. Quite fun asymmetrical gameplay, though as with the SP, can be buggy, and tends to be laggy as well. Worth a try, really.\n\nThe singleplayer I can only really recommend for completionists. Supposedly, the PS2 and Xbox versions are quite different from the PC version and what it’s ported from: the original Xbox 360 game. These older-gen titles play out differently and are more similar to Chaos Theory gameplay-wise. I will have to try them out since hardcore fans seem to like them.\n\nPlay this to complete the Splinter Cell series, or to give a shot at the game's fun, though dying multiplayer mode.","March 5, 2014","true","24.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

The Double Agent game offers so many choices for Sam, eah leading down a different road to who he is to become by end game. It is definately recommended by me.

So the aiming has definitely improved and you can actually take people out silently with one shot without first missing five times, then alerting everyone from here to Timbuktu.\n\nAt least some of the levels are decent, and some are meh, then you have the reoccuring JBA levels where you are given a timer of about 25 minutes or so, and in that time you can complete objectives for either the NSA, or the JBA. Usually at least one of these objectives is more or less mandatory but if you sit on your ♥♥♥ too much and not complete anything, you will lose trust with whichever side you were sitting on your ♥♥♥ for.\n\nOh yeah, this game has a trust system, where you can choose which side to stab in the back and then get a different ending and certain cutscenes are different :D! Some objectives in any given level can gain trust for one side and reduce trust for the other, and if you lose too much trust for either side, its game over.\n\nWell I guess I should mention those bugs now, well for me anyway; some of the safecracking minigames would just act like my keyboard was dead or something, and it wouldn't react to my input  whatsoever, so I had to skip them (Good thing those particular safes were optional) and lose a staggering amount of trust for the NSA, nearly causing me to get a game over. Also at the ending cutscene where some guys break through the ceiling windows, they just stand around, staring angrily into the next room where Sam was, doing nothing, and the soldiers would just randomly move around and glitch up and down stairs and whatnot (What a fitting, hilarious ending to this glitchy mess of a PC version of a game), so I couldn't actually see the credits and the ending, so I raged out of the game and just watched the ending online.\n\nIt's kind of ridiculous how the other two earlier Splinter Cell games on steam work just fine but this, the more recent one, is a good bit broken and glitchy. Either way, they should have this ♥♥♥♥ patched, period. And not have us get a third party patch or go on their site or whatever, it's just plain annoying.\n\nIt's not a terrible game but I just wish it wasn't a glitchfest of a PC port and the game did certain things better.\n\nThis is definitely my least favorite Splinter Cell game, right next to Conviction.","November 1, 2013","false","8.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","1"

The worst port of all time gives you wonderful glitches every 15 minutes that makes you restart the game, not to mention the crap controls, horrific story (old gen version is sooo much better), and level design that instead like other splintercell games would take me about 45 minutes to 90 minutes per mission going through first time, i beat all mission in about 10 to 18 minutes going first time in this game. Even the last mission gave a crappy very easy (on the hardest difficulty) level. The only thing hard about this game is avoiding all glitches and figuring out, that to stop the glitch upon Fisher getting arrested in the last mission and the game freezing, is to turn the resolution to the smallest for the game move forward into the last cutscene. Also every you alt tab it either crashes or takes ♥♥♥♥ing 5 minutes just to load back in. Not recommended 2/10 would not play again.\nHell this game was worst than Blacklist and its basic story, and Essientals combined.","August 15, 2014","false","13.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

On top of that; you can only select resolutions below 1080p.

The bugs and glitches in this game are abundant and are a glaring problem. Add this with where autosaves and hard saves don't actually save, and you got yourself a piece of crap. I have given this game 7 chances (meaning I have restarted the game because of the issue with saves being deleted) and each time have recieved the same bugs and glitches.\n\nGameplay\nSplinter Cell Double Agent is like every other Splinter Cell game. You stealth your way through each level and complete the set of objectives given to you without raising to much alarm or getting killed. Not to hard right? Well it is when game breaking bugs come into the picture. For example, in one level you are prompted to make mines, but before you start making the mines, you are supposed to listen to 2 people talk. I listened to the people talk, and when I went to make the mines, the mini game to make the mines didn't work properly. However, as little as I played, the game itself was an average stealth game.\n\nGraphics\nThe games graphics are average in my opinion. They aren't anything spectacular, but I can forgive it for how long ago it came out.\n\nStory\nThe story is rather mediocre. It's a story that countless spy movies and game have copied and pasted for years now and it's not very creative. In my reviews I don't tell plot summary, so if you want to read the story, look it up or read the description for the game.\n\nFinal Scores\nGameplay: 7\nGraphics: 6\nStory: 4\nOverall: 5.7\n\n\n","October 10, 2015","false","11.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Kinda.\nSingleplayer is pretty linear and most of the levels are a drag; like who wants to sneak around in some African battlefield in broad daylight? Or hide behind tents and glaciers in Iceland? And don't get me started on those damn JBA missions...\nThere are some cool levels like when you escape from prison or blow up a cruise ship, but it still doesn't suffice for how boring the earlier segments are. The ending level is the most excitement you'll get from this game but you'll probably be bored out of your mind before you can get to it :D\n\nOh, and I forgot to mention, you get to make choices in this game. None of it really matters, though, because you don't really care for anyone that your choice affects so you're basically trying to be good (NSA) or evil (JBA) for no real purpose except for the ending, and there's only 1 true ending to this game (which happens to be the ending everyone hates), so the others are baloney.\n\nMultiplayer is fun, probably the only redeeming thing this game has to offer but I won't go into that.\n\nConclusion:\nSplinter Cell: DA is a subpar stealth game with a subpar story with subpar character with locations that are subpar for stealth -- but the multiplayer is good. 6/10\n\nSide Note: The console version of this game (PS2, Wii, Xbox) is amazing, almost as good as Chaos Theory.","December 12, 2014","false","23.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AmericanPatrol/recommended/13580/","AmericanPatrol","Mand'alor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AmericanPatrol/","62 products in account","I loved Chaos Theory like a brother, but this might be the worst game I've ever played.\n\nIt's not just the glitches and the crashes. Alpha Protocol was buggy (though not as buggy as this), but I still love that game. I can get past a few bugs, but this game was broken from its inception. It's muddled in terrible, dumbed-down, counter-intuitive design. It's an insult to the brilliant design in the previous three. The horrible PC port was just the icing on the cake.\n\nThe first three games were reasonably paced, and emphasized a reliance on light and sound. If you were going to complete your mission, you needed to be a master of the shadows. In Double Agent, they dial it back to the lowest common denominator, and just make you hide behind conveniently placed objects. They try to pretend that light still plays a factor with a little yellow light on the back of your suit, but even when the light says you're concealed, enemies can still spot you from miles away. Direct concealment, and exploitation of predictable patrol patterns, is your only option out in the field.\n\nBut it's out of the field where it really hits the fan. In the JBA headquarters, Sam is tasked with skulking around the base and completing tasks for both the NSA and JBA, but doing so requires mastery of one of the worst level layouts in history. If you remember that 3D map that you never used in Chaos Theory, just because it worked so poorly that the game was easier to navigate without it, you'd be happy to know that it makes a triumphant return in Double Agent. Prepare to squint like your life depended on it, as you try to make heads or tails of all the different branching paths that lead to dead ends, and plot a precise route to your objective, only to be sent back to the drawing board when you come across a secuity door, and need to plot a new route to whatever grand McGuffin will unlock it. None of this is even challenging at all, it's just unbelievably tedious.\n\nAnd that's my biggest problem with this game. It's so lazy, so insecure in its ability to give you a single, satisfying experience, that it just piles on busywork and hopes that'll keep you satiated.

Alpha Protocol was buggy (though not as buggy as this), but I still love that game. I can get past a few bugs, but this game was broken from its inception. It's muddled in terrible, dumbed-down, counter-intuitive design. It's an insult to the brilliant design in the previous three. The horrible PC port was just the icing on the cake.\n\nThe first three games were reasonably paced, and emphasized a reliance on light and sound. If you were going to complete your mission, you needed to be a master of the shadows. In Double Agent, they dial it back to the lowest common denominator, and just make you hide behind conveniently placed objects. They try to pretend that light still plays a factor with a little yellow light on the back of your suit, but even when the light says you're concealed, enemies can still spot you from miles away. Direct concealment, and exploitation of predictable patrol patterns, is your only option out in the field.\n\nBut it's out of the field where it really hits the fan. In the JBA headquarters, Sam is tasked with skulking around the base and completing tasks for both the NSA and JBA, but doing so requires mastery of one of the worst level layouts in history. If you remember that 3D map that you never used in Chaos Theory, just because it worked so poorly that the game was easier to navigate without it, you'd be happy to know that it makes a triumphant return in Double Agent. Prepare to squint like your life depended on it, as you try to make heads or tails of all the different branching paths that lead to dead ends, and plot a precise route to your objective, only to be sent back to the drawing board when you come across a secuity door, and need to plot a new route to whatever grand McGuffin will unlock it. None of this is even challenging at all, it's just unbelievably tedious.\n\nAnd that's my biggest problem with this game. It's so lazy, so insecure in its ability to give you a single, satisfying experience, that it just piles on busywork and hopes that'll keep you satiated. I do not play Splinter Cell to navigate through a cartoonish series of security doors, I play it for a challenging, satisfying stealth game. Double Agent is the complete opposite of everything the original three games stood for, and as a result, has none of what made them fun or interesting.\n\nIt's a horrible game even if you forgive the bugs, but they're still well worth mentioning.

I remember having this game on Playstation 2 back in the day and having fond memories of it and yet people keep saying this is not nearly as good as Chaos Theory.  While Chaos Theory is amazing I recall Double Agent having most of the same mechanics and an interesting undercover element.  So I install it to give it one more playthrough only to see what everyone was fussing about.  This is NOT the game I played on PS2.  Not by a long shot.  The missions are all different.  The story, the gameplay... Everything dumbed down.  As a long time fan of this series I was always confused by how so many people said this wasn't a good game.  Now I see why.\n\nPC Double Agent is a very different animal to the console Double Agent in every way.  All the things I liked about the PS2 version is not here.  I enjoyed this game but despite its flaws and unlike all the other Splinter Cell games I have no desire to ever touch this one again.  The biggest problem was just how hard it was to avoid being spotted.  Like when you thought you were well hiddent and it turns out you weren't and there's no chance seeing it coming.  Enemies can spot you miles away and will shoot you instantly with pinpoint accuracy.  Sometimes through walls.  The undercover aspect between missions where you sneak around the terrorists base to do things during a time limit has been significantly dumbed down as well.  Oh get spotted in a restricted area "Fisher you're not supposed to be here" with a little bump in trust.  I rememebr the stakes being much higher on PS2 with them shooting you on sight and better level design as well.  There just doesn't seem to be any tension in the stealth.   You either succesffully sneak through or you dont.  Half the time I would just go around a corner after being spotted and wait for the alert to go away after a second and its like nothing happened.  Oh noes my stealth score goes down?  I can't unlock gear that I'll never need?  pFFFFt say what you will about Conviction and Blacklist being more action oriented but at least those game's mechanics work well.\n\nEdit: I didn't even talk about the crappy interface and other issues that plague this game.  When spacebar is your action button for everything from opening doors to turning light switches to grabbing guards from behind it makes sense to have a prompt on screen to let you know exactly what you're about to do.  All the games before this had it simply say it at the bottom of the screen.  Here its shoved in your face in the middle of the screen as if to say "YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO A THING JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ADD AND CAN'T TELL"  As if thats not bad enough you can't use your mouse while hacking computers or reading emails.  You can't even type in the numbers when using a keypad lock!  Sometimes while opening safes it doesn't register the keys until you play with the mouse wheel for some reason.  Top it all off with glitches such as bodies flying away after you drop them completely destroying your efforts of hiding them.  On a couple occasions they just flopped around for minutes until enemies nearby noticed and i was screwed.  This doesn't even touch on the save issues when it doesn't read its own auto saves or in one mission reoloading a save causes the game to crash.  Its all these little problems littered throughought the game that just made it more of a hassle.  I mean Chaos Theory (the game before this) had gamepad support!  It didn't work very well.  It didn't register R2 and L2 on a PS3 controller but it was there.  This one has none.  Doesn't read the controller at all... How do you have so many downgrades?  Its so counter-intuitive to PC gaming when even the first Splinter Cell was more intuitive than this!!!!\n\nThis is the only game in the series where I will say skip it.  If you can get an old copy of a console version in a bargain bin somewhere go for that.  That version is far superior to this extreme change for no reason.  Makes no sense why they made two completely different games for different platforms.  For all I know the Xbox version is even more different so I would play it safe and just find a PS2 if you must play every game in the series.","August 7, 2015","false","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I suffered from the famous and seemingly unsolvable "unlocked-gadget"-bug: Unlocked gadgets don't show up in the inventory and are hence not usable. This makes the game less fun as some of the gadgets are really cool. Also, the game is way harder this way because gadget advantages like speed-hacking or additional hacking time due to the upgraded hacking device can't be profited from.\nAnother bug I encountered is the "resolution bug" that lets the game freeze during the last mission if the screen resolution is not 800x600. Seriously Ubisoft???\nOther bugs include missing savegames after restarting the game, forcing you to start missions all over again, etc...\n\nThe game itself is decent. The morale feature is a neat upgrade and most of the missions are fun. The "JBA-HQ"-missions (of which there are 4) are really annoying, however. They consist of playing boring mini games and then struggling to find the NSA objectives using the totally useless and heavily confusing 3D-map that "features" dancing labels as you rotate, making it completely impossible to precisely pinpoint an objective's location.\n\nBottom line: The game is okay despite the fact that a third of the missions are crap. But the fact that Ubisoft releases such an unfinished piece of software and fails to patch it into a playable state within a decade is simply pathetic.","March 16","false","15.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I then bought the first 3 Splinter Cells on PC and finished all three of them a couple of years ago. Each one was fantastic though I felt that the shadows in Pandora Tomorrow were a little off but otherwise good. The game that stood out of the three however was Chaos Theory with hardly anything to critise about it. It had brilliant stealth mechanics, a great soundtrack, great level design, good story, supposedly good co-op (haven't played it) and of course the legendary spies vs mercs mode.\n\nAfter three amazing titles, you would expect the 4th installment of the series to be able to live up to its predecessors right? Wrong!\n\nThis game makes me rage in so many ways! The game feels rushed and unfished, the first game had good stealth mechanics, it beats this in terms of stealth mechanics by far which means that this isn't just a step back, this is a few jumps backwards. There are rarely any proper shadows in this which means that the only way you can tell if you're invisible is by looking at the indicator either on your back or in the bottom left hand corner of your screen; if it is green you're invisible, if it's yellow, you are visible and are at risk of being detected and if you are red then you better run mofo because you're about to get your backside handed to you.\n\nThis sounds like an okay system and may have been more acceptable had the light metres in the previous games never existed, but the problem with it is that the shadows aren't dark enough most of the time like they were in the previous titles which makes running into the shadows game of chance as either it will hide you or it won't, it's not obvious when you're about to enter an invisible area and because of this, I was constantly being detected in absolutely rediculous ways which was not fun at all and because of this I was constantly autosaving way more than I would of needed to in the earlier splinter cells, I think on average I autosaved about 55 times per level.\n\nThe story however is actually good and I did enjoy it, what this game does offer that the previous titles did not were the ability to make choices in the game and making those choices would result in different outcomes which would give the game more replay value if the gameplay wasn't so bad.\n\nBut one of the biggest problems I have with the game is it's incredibly bad PC port, it is so sloppy despite it being the same version of the game as the xbox 360 and the PS3. Why is it so bad? it crashes constantly for no reason and I have quite a high spec 3 month old pc and this is 2014, the game is so badly optimised and it is absolutely outrageous that ubisoft haven't fixed it, I'd hate to think what would happen if I were to run this on my old computer with 10 year old hardware.\n\nThe menu system in the game is annoying and every time you want to hack into a computer or look under a door, you have to watch this stupid animation on your opsat which lasts 3 seconds, that might not sound that bad but when you have to watch it so regularly and it's the same animation over and over again it really gets frustrating.\n\nI've also heard that Spies Vs Mercs was completely ruined in double agent which is just another reason not to like the game so just throwing that out there.\n\nOh, and every time you either want to hack a safe or the mine assembly (both of which are annoying events that you have to do), make sure that you are in running mode as the game was so badly ported from console that when you try and do this whilst in walking mode, your controls to crack the safe or assemble the mines will simply not work.\n\nThe only thing I can praise about the game are it's graphics and it's story oh and about that! I finished the last level last night and it loaded a cutscene in game, but the AI kept getting stuck on one of the textures which means that the cutscene was just stuck and my camera was stuck on the guy who was stuck and kept clipping through the catwalk so basically, I couldn't actually finish the game properly and so I had to look up the endings on youtube, absolutely redicolous given how old this game is now!\n\nOne other thing I forgot to mention is that for the JBA which is the organisation you're working for but are actually a double agent, you have to visit and carry out objectives within their safehouse 4 times! 4 times! That's just repetitive and it's confusing trying to get to know your way around it especially for the final level seeing as the map on your opsat is just plain awful.\n\nSo all in all, this game is worth playing I believe, but not on PC. Get Double Agent Version 1 on Xbox 360 or PS3 but not PC, it is just too buggy and it will annoy the hell out of you otherwise!\n\nOne final note, there are actually two versions of Double agent, version 1 is on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC and version 2 is on Xbox, PS2, gamecube and wii. Version two was done by Ubisoft Montreal and as a result, I've been told that version 2 is much much better than version 1 and it is a completely different game with a completely different level layout even though they share the same name, apparently it feels more like Chaos Theory so I can't wait to check that out at some point.\n\nThe bugs in this game make it unacceptable and it is a dissapointment given how great the last splinter cell was, only thing that holds it up are the graphics, the story, voice acting and I guess the level design.\n\nAll in all, this game gets a 4/10 for me on PC as even though the story was very good, the gameplay was littered with bugs, bad stealth mechanics and felt nothing like its predecessors.","April 2, 2014","false","18.3"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","13","1","8","2","0"

There is a good amount of intensity in this game, there were times where I would be hiding in lockers or in the shadows with my heart beating as I narrowly dodged those metaphorical bullets.

Also for reasons I don't know, certain graphics such as shadows and textures are missing or unexplainably low. These problems aren't present in any other port. The PC port is capped at 30fps and doesn't support widescreen without hacks, something that was present in the previous game. If you want splitscreen multiplayer, buy it on PS3. The Xbox 360 version is missing it, which is odd, because the demo on Xbox Live has fully functioning splitscreen.\n\nIf possible/you have a 6th gen console/you liked Chaos Theory/You already played this, buy the 5th gen version instead for Xbox, PS2, or Gamecube. The screenshots in the steam store page are from that version, which shares the story in common and is otherwise a completely different game, that is an experience more like Chaos Theory, rather than a new game engine (All games are Unreal Engine 2, but Chaos Theory, and the 5th gen version of DA use one version, while the 6th gen/PC version of DA use a rewritten version of UE2).\n\nThis game is great but suffers from being a rushed PC port, and suffers from being misleading (Nonsteam advertisements also used media from the 5th gen versions)","October 17, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At least i'm lucky enought and the game din't become unplayable, but others aren't so lucky.\n\nI recomend?

The level designs and concepts were great.  But the huge number of bugs/glitches/annoyances managed to suck all the fun out of this game.  I regularly I had to do internet searches on how to get around various problems so that I could progress in the game.\n\nThe game crashes frequently.  And the saves sometimes get into some sort of corrupted state so that you have no choice but find a previous save (if you have one) and replay parts of the game.\n\nAnd if the save system wasn't so bad, this could be tolerable.  But quick saves don't work at all (apparently related to what drive you have the game installed on).  So you have to do manual saves and the saves don't get any sort of name and just appear in an unnecessarily small window (can see 4 at a time) in a random order (not even by save date) -- a total pain if you need to find the 2nd or 3rd last save so that you can replay to work around a problem.\n\nAnd the final level was just a travesty.  The game crashed in so many places and saves got corrupted.  You work around all of that and then you finally difuse the bomb and then the game just freezes -- nothing.  You have to use task manager to shut down the game and restart yet again.  Then finally found out that you had to change screen resolution to 800x600 just before you completed the final task so that could see the final cutscene and progess to the bonus mission.\n\nI can't believe that a product ever got released like this and obviously received such little support from the developers.  I don't really care whether this was Steam's fault, the publisher's fault or the developer's fault.  But the result is that a potentially very engaging game has become an epic fail.","September 12, 2015","false","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Regardless of what you think of the gameplay itself, the PC version is a mess. The first thing I noticed was even on "Next Generation Graphics" as the game calls them, the game looks worse than its console counterparts. Okay so graphics aren't everything, well there's more. Certain areas of the environment also aren't as fleshed out. For example in the console version there is a section in the 2nd mission where you have to sneak past a prison guard as usual, but it's pretty easy since you have natural cover to sneak behind. In the PC version, this cover is mission and the guard walks in circles on an empty plateau. Still, this doesn't really bother me. So why the negative review? Well there's the broken lighting. Yes in a game about hiding in shadows, the lighting doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing work properly by default. You have to edit ini files and maybe just maybe it will work, but good luck. And finally most infuriating of all are the crashes. Alt tabbing will crash your game, loading levels will crash your game, saving will crash your game.

Allow me to be as clear as possible. I purchased this game from gamestop years ago and the game ran just fine. What's wrong with the steam version? Let's see: Constant crashes, resolution fixed at 1280x900, screen flickering, and did I mention the crashes? All in all it feels like I am playing a pirated version of the game. There are no achievements or cards for the game. I'm going to sit here and guarantee you that the pirate version of the game runs 100% better than the steam version.","December 25, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first glance this is just another sh***ty Ubisoft port, but if you take some time to make the proper tweaks to the configuration files ( I know its not the way it should be, but this game is worth it) than this game really becomes one of the best in the SC series and a proper PC version. It has that the same mechanics as Chaos Theory (variable speeds, lockpicking, hacking) with a very interesting plot and mission setup. I love wandering around the JBA HQ in-between missions and suddenly realizing your somewhere you shouldn't be and find a hidden objective, the game doesn't hold your hand through this you just have to figure it out. As always with SC play on the hardest difficulty for that super-tense experience.\n\nRefer to this page for graphic tweaks and other fixes:\nhttp://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Splinter_Cell:_Double_Agent\n\nYou can also look up how to force 'ultra-high' settings, which are not guaranteed to work but do make this game look stunning for a 2006 release.\n\nIf SC 7 is ever coming I hope the devs look back at this title and Chaos Theory, not Blacklist and Conviction which were still fun and gorgeous but didn't have as much focus on stealth and planning.\n\nI really hope we get Pandora Tommorow on Steam some day!\n","May 8","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will admit this game was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc port but everything is 100% fixable with a half hour at most of your time. You can just google some fixes for the errors and you can fix it to 1080p. Also the online servers are still up as well so if anyone wants to ever play hit me up. I have 4 other friends who still play online as well and it's super fun.
