This will allow players to easily see which resource icons tie to which goods (making it easier to determine which goods will be in demand next turn).  Since this addresses my primary problem with the game, I'm changing my review from a "thumbs down" to a "thumbs up".  It's always great to see developers making an effort to listen to their community.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/games/346080/announcements/detail/178226731035200853\n---\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nThis game seriously frustrated me to the point where I had to quit, which is a real shame because I really wanted to like it.  The goal is simple: make as much money as you can by buying low and selling high within so many turns.  The problem: the tutorial will leave you with some unanswered questions and the market simply doesn't make sense, at least to me.  For one, the pictures above the planets don't always match the goods in the market...take the tree symbol, for example.  Does this represent oxygen, lumber, or both in the market?  If the atom icon is a category (it's not sold in the market), then what goods fall under it?  Why can't the symbols above the planets match the pictures in the market exactly so that there is no confusion?  Very little about this game makes sense (lack of tool-tips don't help either) and has the potential to frustrate first-time players as it did me. I personally can't recommend this game until it becomes a bit more-user friendly and less unnecessarily difficult to figure out.  If the above issues don't deter you, then please feel free to pick it up as the idea of a quick buy/sell romp does have value for when you're in a pinch and need a quick fix.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAs-hnb7MlA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqL21J3KzvU\n\n----\n\nUPDATE 2/16/15:\n\nThe developer dropped me a line and was nice enough to provide me with intel as to what the different icons represent:\n\nThe Atom  = Technology Type. (Scrap,Nano Bots, Ship Engines)\nThe Tree = Organic Type. (Wood , Food, Oxygen)\nPink Diamond  = Gems (Crystal, Siliumantite, Amandamite)\nGold Bar = Metal (Iron, Gold, Palatium )\nBrown Box = Normal (Not seeking or selling any specific type)\n\nHope this helps anyone else who may also be experiencing the same frustrations I had.","February 16, 2015","true","1.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","8"

This isn't casual, it's simply so shallow that it lacks any kind of staying power after a couple of games.\n\nThe actual resource generation and prices are also very weird. For example a "mineral" planet would often have iron, gold or gems for a price much higher than one not producing them...while I understand having a fixed system would make the game even duller this randomness makes trying to plot trade routes an exercise in frustration. The planets in need of a certain commodity would also often just accept a single type from that category, and sometimes at a somewhat poor selling price.\n\nAll things considered Astro Emporia is simply lacking, there's not enough to do to keep you interested for more than 15 minutes and what's there is not good enough.","December 21, 2015","false","4.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Because I was longing for the original DW game, this title made my day, and I spent some very nice time.\n\nThough the assets are not drugs, the idea sounds similar. May be some similar events might be added, like being mugged by space pirates, or price of an asset increasing suddenly due to a catastrophe etc. Even though the game does not have those features, or it won't have them, it got my attention, and I will be spending a lot of time on it!\n\nThere's one slightly negative side to the game: it should be optimized. My Macbook Pro's reballed graphics card handles a lot of games easily but with this one it just started heating and spinning the fans crazily.

While it doesn't fail in what it sets out to do, it sets the bar so low and does so little that it's difficult to recommend. You travel between a random smattering of planets, purchasing goods on one so that you can sell them on another in purley menu-driven travel and barter. Once you get a feel for the price ranges of the very limited number of goods up for trade, you buy low, sell high, and repeat ad infinitum. That is rather literally the extent of the game. No unpredictable events to throw a wrench in your plans, no combat, nothing to add even the barest amount of variation, excitement, or entertainment to the experience. You have debt that grows with each turn, but it's easily paid off within a few turns, bringing the only challenging aspect of the game to heel in short order. There's a mode that allows you to also buy the planets, but having completed that as well, I can assure you that it's a very unrewarding experience. There are early Flash games on Newgrounds with more depth and content than Astro Emporia, making it a poor purchase at any price.","June 9, 2015","false","2.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/srcleaves/recommended/346080/","srcleaves","srcleaves","http://steamcommunity.com/id/srcleaves/","200 products in account","This mobile port is an exercise in randomness and not worth your time.\n\nLately I've been feeling nostalgic for games like Sundog: Frozen Legacy and Escape Velocity Nova. With space trading games I generally dislike the combat systems and would prefer to travel around and explore, perform missions, upgrade my ship, etc. But most of the space trading games I've found force combat upon you. Astro Emporia has no combat, it is purely a trading game, but it is too random and simplistic to be enjoyable. The game was designed for getting the highest score you can in a set number of turns. You have a choice of 15, 30, or 60 turns or a Buyout mode where you attempt to buy all the planets in the solar system. Every game starts you with $4000 credits and a loan payment of $4000 credits. The loan just seems like an artificial difficulty to soak up some of your early profits. Assuming you can find decent trades you can pay the loan off quite quickly. After that there are no costs outside of buying goods. Your ship apparently has infinite fuel and all routes between planets are open from the beginning of the game.\n\nAfter my first couple plays, feeling the game was very random, I began tracking high and low prices for goods in a spreadsheet. Across three games I found the highs and lows quite similar. At that point it was easy to determine which prices were the best at a planet and buy accordingly. Each planet has two icons, one that indicates the type of goods the planet produces and the other to indicate the type of goods the planet wants on the next turn. For the most part you can ignore these. There are 4 main groups of goods: natural, mineral, gemstone, and technology. Each of those groups has 3 possible goods. For example, natural is comprised of wood, food, and oxygen. Each of the groups has a low-end good, a medium good, and a high-end good. For example, technology has scrap at the low-end, nano bots at the medium level, and ship engines at the high-end. As the game progresses you'll need to focus on higher level goods to maximize profit from your limited cargo area. What I've found on numerous occassions is that planets which indicate they specialize in a good will have terrible prices for those goods. And the indicator about what goods the planet wants on the next turn as often as not ends up with you bringing a good they just don't want at all. You will have turns where you are unable to sell and just need to go to a different planet. Once you complete the number of turns in the game you will be insulted for your score, even if it is quite good.\n\nThe buyout mode doesn't change the game in a major way. Your goal is to buy every planet in the system. The starting price is a bit over 39k and it doubles each time you buy a planet meaning the final planet will cost around 50 million. You score is basically the number of turns it takes for you to buy all the planets. I found the prices did not line up as well with the timed modes in my spreadsheet in that prices were often lower than I'd seen in previous games.\n\nThe port is fine. It is built on the Unity engine and you can select your resolution and graphics quality as well as fullscreen or windowed mode. The game looks nice, though it definitely has a mobile game feel to it. The artwork is fairly generic but there is no confusion between the various goods. Although the solar system is randomly generated it doesn't matter. You can get to all planets from turn one and each planet's goods change from turn to turn.\n\nI picked this up for $0.89 on a Steam sale and I've gotten my money's worth out of it, but it wasn't due to enjoyment. It was much more because I stubbornly wanted to see what the economic system was like. In a word: random.\n","February 27, 2015","false","4.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","8","11","3","0"

You buy resources in one place, go to another place and sell them for a higher price. And that's it. That's all there is. Well, you can upgrade your ship to hold more cargo and there's a negligible debt you have to pay off. There's also a few different modes: one where you buy up planets and another where you see how much money you can get in a limited number of turns. That's it.\n\nThe game functions. It works. It does what it is trying to do. What it's trying to do is so slight, it's not worth paying for. It's just so bare bones and basic. The dev makes it clear that they were trying to create a casual, simple game. That's fine. That's absolutely fine. I have nothing against casual games, I like casual games, I play casual games. However, this is something that truly feels like it should be available for free on Kongregate or Newgrounds. Even three dollars feels like too much for this. There are better and fuller versions of this concept out there for free.\n\nEven if all you want is a very basic trading game, there are other places for you to go.","July 13, 2015","false","3.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
