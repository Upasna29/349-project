It took me a fair amount of time to solve the couple of (actually very simple) puzzles that are there, the time taken mostly by not noticing visual clues which lead to the solution of the puzzle. But even with this relatively slow problem solving the whole game lasted 90mins. Its like a single level of a game.\n\nI fully understand the tiny market the developers are dealing with here and they would like to pay their own wages and invest in the future of the platform, but I have come away from this game feeling very impressed with the content that is there but unhappy with the amount of it.\n\nI feel like even within the small level that you play through the developers could have stretched out the content, maybe making it a little more difficult or simply putting more puzzles in each stage of the level.\n\nI think ultimately it comes down to this: Are you prepared to invest $30/£23 in not just your own experience but in the future of the platform and the developers, because you have to want both as the experience itself just isn't worth the asking price in terms of what we are used to as far as games go.\n\nI wouldn't have chosen a 'yes' or 'no' for the recommend option if I didn't have to as I think it hinges on the above question. Personally I think bringing the price down to £17-18 would make it easier to accept and help the game gain wider adoption ultimately resulting in not much loss of revenue, if any at all. Having said this I expect the developers have done more research into the market than my anecdotal guessing.","April 17","false","2.6"," 101 of 132 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","101","132","0","0"

Specifically the Vive until Oculus Touch arrives assuming dev support for the Touch controllers.\n\nAt a $30 price point for the time I spent in the game I would be hesitant to recommend this right out, but I think that the quality of the game and the polish I felt while playing it I would definitely suggest giving this a shot. Don't go into this thinking it will be like the old school point and click adventures as the puzzles are generally nonexistant and you rarely interact directly with any characters. Go into this for the feeling of adventure.\n\nPros:\n-Looks and sounds beautiful\n-Great acting\n-Movement system pretty intuitive and with no motion sickness\n-Interacting with everything feels great\n-Feels like I'm in a movie\n\nCons:\n-Short, very short. Short enough that I am concerned about the price point.\n-Shooting flares was somehow the hardest thing I had to do in the game\n-Very subjective, but I wanted significantly more puzzles than I got.","April 5","true","1.4"," 57 of 66 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","57","66","6","12"

On one hand I want to give this a positive review because it's a great gaming experience with some neat writing, fun ideas, amazing atmosphere and immersion, etc. It hits on nearly every single element a VR title should.\n\nSome gripes though....\n\nWhy does the first video on the store page for Gallery spoil the entire ending? Like, I think they show every single segment that happens to close the chapter in that one minute video to preview their game. Seems really....Strange.\n\n30$ for a single episode of a multi episode series? Will this be five episodes? To finish the story we'll be paying around 175$ after tax for this product. Jesus. I mean....That's like a full fledged triple A product with the largest DLC bundle that'll be dishing out content for 12+ months to come....Maybe they'll be cheaper? Hope so.\n\nSecondly the content is short, I mean, really short. Don't let my two hours fool you, I started and restarted and started and restarted and spent like an hour in the main section of the game. I'd say this game could probably be beat in one sitting spending around 30 mins if you know what you're doing. Probably less.\n\nSo for 30$ we only get the first episode (as bizarre and economically shady as that sounds) and hopefully enough excitement to sustain interest long enough to purchase Episode 2....Whenever it comes out and however much they charge for it (the fact I don't know these things is also disconcerting).\n\nI guess....Please just make it longer. You've kind of trapped me between my expensive new device and curiousity because I've already dropped money into your project. So, please make it longer and even offer different avenues and solutions to puzzles so the game can have a tiny bit of replayability.\n\nFor now? Negative I guess, wish I didn't have to. I just don't have a positive feeling despite reallying enjoying the product, I think how they have handled that episodic system is really amateur and it leaves all of these early adopters who just spent thousands on gear standing yet again outside waiting to be let in with the hope and promise it'll be nice and warm when that time comes.","May 21","false","2.6"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","35","42","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxolus/recommended/270130/","toxolus","Toxolus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxolus/","9 products in account","Summary:\n\n+ Very polished, beautiful graphics\n+ Nice and fluent user interface\n+ Quite atmospheric\n- Way too short\n- Negligable content\n- Generic story\n\n"When I finished this game and put off my headset, it was the first time I left VR with an undeniable feeling of disappointment."\n\nI'll start my review with the most obvious and outstanding positive aspect this game has to offer: It's visuals and atmosphere. You won't encounter the best graphics a PC game has ever offered, but perhaps the best so far incorporated into a VR experience. To stroll around in this environment is a nice pastime in itself, and I really recommend to do so if you want to squeeze some play time out of this game.\n\nThis positive impression is even intensified by the relatively large number of interactive objects placed all over the area. Admittedly, most of these items do not allow much more than to grab and view them before you have to put them back or throw them away, others even can just be pushed around. However, in my opinion non-interactive decoration is especially disappointing in VR, so I really approve of this level of detail.\n\nThe second big plus of this game is its fluent user interface. The backpack inventory works well and just looks great. Picking up, using and combining items mostly worked like a charm.\n\nIf you want a decent example of what is currently possible in the visual department of VR, don't expect more and just have the money, don't read any further and just open your pocket. I suppose in this case your rig also contains at least a GTX 980, which I would more than recommend for this game.\n\nIf it is the label "VR puzzle adventure" that caught your attention - like it was for me - then you better prepare for a disappointment that reaches from slight to huge, depending on your expectations. Either Cloudhead Games put a disproportionate strong focus on visuals right from the start, or they just ran out of time, budget or both, and didn't manage to add a decent amount of puzzles and story elements. Taking into account the large number of absolutely useless (in the sense of unused) clues littered all over the walls, I'd vote for the latter.\n\nTo put this into numbers: The whole game contains not more than four puzzles that are halfways worthy to be named as such. This is even less than the number of stages or levels, and consequently there are stages without any puzzle at all. Well, if you need a map to navigate from your living room to your kitchen and perceive this endeavor as challenging, your counter might go as high as half a dozen puzzles. To put this lack of content into other words: If you watched the video and screenshots on top of this page, you didn't see a teaser but literally every single relevant scene of the game.\n\nWhen it comes to the story, there is not much to say, as there is not much story. It is not particularly bad or good, it is just generic. You'll encounter stereotypic video game story elements as the crazy scientist, the alien artefact, the guys that litter the environment with short audio snippets (for whatever reasons, probably because they are just carrying too many audio tapes with them), the sewers (big plus, I love sewers), and some nondescript bad guy. As the story starts to unfold, the game unfortunately ends.\n\nConclusion: Cloudhead Games put a lot of effort and budget into the visual appearance of this game - with success. Unfortunately they forgot to divert some resources into the creation of a sufficient amount of puzzles so the game could be called a puzzler. Most browser escape games offer more and more challenging puzzles. If you decide to give this game a try, do it slowly. Take your time, enjoy the environment and then even slow down more. If you start to rush, you'll ecounter the credits in less than an hour.","April 19","false","3.5"," 39 of 59 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","39","59","0","0"

On paper it's a straightforward adventure game but, if The Gallery is any indication, VR will be transformative for the genre. The hand tracking makes such a difference. For example, early on you're navigating some dark tunnels. You've got a map and you've got a torch. To look at the map you reach over your back to grab your backpack, get the map out, hold it up to your face and shine the torch on it with your other hand. While these interactions are necessarily a little abstracted (without any kind of finger tracking you're only really able to grab and release), they're enough to really draw you in to the experience. And it is absolutely worth being drawn in to.\n\nRegarding price, I don't have a problem with it at all. Maybe in the future when there are thousands of incredible 10+ hour VR games to choose from at the same price point I would think twice. Right now though this is an experience you can't get anywhere else. Compared to the IMAX, a football match or a theme park I think it’s totally reasonable. If anything it might be too cheap considering the limited user base and the high production values. I hope the developers make enough from it to finish the story.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is great; please buy it so I can play the next one.\n","April 9","true","2.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThePengu/recommended/270130/","ThePengu","Pengu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThePengu/","263 products in account","Summary:\n\nPros\n- Looks good\n- Immersive\n- Inventory system is fantastic\n\nCons\n- Cumbersome teleport mechanic compared to the teleport mechanic in other VR games\n- Overpriced\n- Short (1-2 hours)\n- Puzzles and exploration are the main focus of the game, but the puzzles fall short\n\nIn Depth:\nThis game is very visual, it tries to look good, and succeeds most of the time. There are only a few moments in the game where I noticed poor-quality textures or mesh clipping. The textures could be due to the fact my GPU is the minimum recommended, so it's not a big deal for me. The game ran fine, no graphical lag, no crashes.\n\nAt the time of writing Call of the Starseed is probably one of the most graphically appealing vive reality games out, if you want to experience a nice looking game, this is your best bet, but don't expect the earth.\n\nThe main pro here, is that the game is quite immersive due to the way it looks and plays. Another main plus point is the inventory system, I think it sets the benchmark for every other future VR game. Hands down. It doesn’t break the immersion, it’s easy to use, I just wish I could put anything in there not just key items.\n\nHowever, there are quite a few cons.\n\nThe teleport navigation is bad, when so many games have done it so well, it makes me a little baffled to think what they must have done to make it so counter-intuitive. It’s like trying to drag a cat around. How you move your controller and where the teleportation target moves does not seem to be linked by any logic.\n\nPicking stuff up is questionable. Quite often I found essential or interesting items impossible to pick up. In numerous circumstances the floor was lower than my own, meaning pressing my controller against the floor would leave the item an inch from reach. This is not a calibration issue, there are different heights in some of the in game floors. There also seems to be a bug when in which you are unable to pick anything up if holding the magnet gun. No matter what you try to pick up, a vacuum tube will teleport to your hand from the gun. In general that portion of the game was very frustrating. Tubes got stuck inside objects and are needed to complete the puzzle, placing your hands inside one tube and trying to pick it up would pull up another tube to the right of it. You could argue this could be a tracking issue.\n\nThe game is overpriced. It just is to me. I understand that a developer, or multiple developers worked hard on this and need to make a living, but for 95 minutes of gameplay, I paid £22.99. Which means I would be paying £15 per hour for something I didn’t even get 2 hours into. That 95 minutes includes credits and restarting areas several times due to item bugs. If the experience changed my life that would be no problem, but the game is 90% wandering and interacting and 10% puzzles. I only noticed 2 puzzles in the game, (ones that require you to think and work out the solution); both of which only took 5 minutes to complete. Which leaves this game drastically lacking in the gameplay department. Leaving the game a mostly interactive story experience, but for this beggining of an episodic story, there really isn’t much story to be had, and any tidbits you get are from listening to tapes. The final nail in the coffin for the overpriced status, is this game is Episode 1, that’s right, the game is episodic. I understand developers sometimes need to break up a game in order to fund the development process, but if people are not impressed they’re not going to buy the second part. By the time I finished the game, it felt like I had just paid for a lengthy demo. The end was visually spectacular, but that’s it.\n\nTo finish. I had fun, I played it to the end, would I recommend it? Yep. If you don’t mind the cost. Which may seem counter-intuitive to what I have been saying.\nThe fact is the faults of the game could be forgiven if the price was reasonable, and a reasonable price is subject to personal opinion. I will not be asking for a refund, for the following reason. I want the developers to take my money and spend it on the next one, use people’s suggestions to improve the game. I want to see a much longer episode, with more puzzles and more character interactions, but if it falls short again, I will get the episode refunded and wait until the game is a reasonable price.\n\nAlso, the people in the game seem really really small.\n","May 1","true","1.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

If you can afford to buy it, you absolutely should, that said... 30 bucks...? Ehhh... 15 or even 20 may have been easier to swallow, considering I've completed it, and steam shows me at exactly 103 minutes. There's no replayablity, unless you just want to "do it again", or maybe showcase it to a friend.\n\nTHAT SAID, it's awesome for that 100 minutes or so. The puzzles are trivial, and you're mostly just plowing through it to do it. Right when it gets interesting, it ends, but it's episodic. I expected that.\n\nAll told, 30 bucks isn't a big deal to me, and I think it was worth it.

All i can tell you is that if you own the Vive, you need to buy The Gallery: Call of the starseed. I was trying to think of a way of describing how i felt about this VR game and it hit me like a ton of bricks. The Gallery reminds me of PRE-DOTA Valve!!! I am not trying to do Cloudhead games a disservice by comparing them to Valve but their games attention to detail in the environments, the physics of the world and the story completely remind me why i once loved Valve and i think i found my favorite new developer in Cloudhead games. I just started playing The Gallery earlier today and i played for 2 hours straight because they brought their world in this game to life in an amazing way and it sucked me in without any hesitation. I keep reading about people complaining about the price of the game but 30 dollars is a fair price for the best VR game out there right now on the Vive or any other headset bar none.

Polished, Innovative, story driven and ahead of its time. The game is exactly what I have been looking for in a VR experience. The controls just work and the inventory system is very innovative. There is a level of polish seen here that is truly breathtaking for a first gen VR game. The real con here is the lack of content on offer. This game doesn’t feel like a $30 piece of content. It took me only 2 hours to finish and that was after having the final puzzle break on me the first time after completing it; albeit The only bug I encountered in my play through. Seeing as the game does not offer much on the replayability front, it is a hard sell at the current price. I strongly recommend this game to anyone once it goes on sale for $25 or less.

NOW IN 3D","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feroxxy/","123 products in account","The Gallery is an episodic VR game which gives you the vibe of games from the past like MYST - only now you're "really" there! The atmosphere is great and ominous, making you move through greatly detailed area's. As a VR game you can interact with a great deal of items and props which only adds to the immersion (yay fireworks!).\n\nHowever, the game has so many shortcomings that it's impossible for me to upvote it at this current time.\n\n- Performance issues are all over. On the beach I had regular moments in which the screen started to flicker and the framerate would drop to 5, instant nausea for some I bet. In the sewers the game would also go blackscreen on me (luckily your progress is saved per chapter and a couple reloads helped get past the part that'd bug).\n\n- The loading screens are long and prone to crash the game if you interact with things like SteamVR.\n\n- The game does NOT listen to one of the basic rules of Roomscale - keep the virtual ground on the same level as the room's ground. I was unable to pick up multiple items during the game because they were 10cm below my floor.\n\n- For the puzzle adventure genre I found it lacked puzzles - there were only 2-3.\n\n- If this was a game played with a controller / keyboard you'd be finished in an hour, tops. Thats how short it is. VR is there to make you gaze at stuff and be amazed and immersed, I know. But its mostly the movement controls that add to the time played. I tried using the "walkAbout" technique but the cursor would sometimes not flip the room, and I'd find myself traversing back in the level on accident. In the end I just started teleporting instead of walking.\n\n- With a price of 28,- all of these shortcomings are a bit too much for me. Don't forget its only one episode, too, and if you are invested in the story you will have to throw even more money at the screen. If its gonna be anywhere above 15-20,- it will definitely need to feature more gameplay and a longer timespan.\n\n\nNo, I did not hate The Gallery. I loved it. I wanted to be there, shoot fireworks and drink empty bottles of booze. But for 28,- I expect the bottles to be filled. Wait for the price to drop, people.

One, the way the camera adjusted up and down in height depending on what you are standing on is extremely uncomfortable with me and the only time I've experienced motion sickness with my Vive. Granted this is the only game that that has different Heights in room scale that I've played but if it's for immersion reasons I'm two floating hands that cast shadows, having my view locked to a height to avoid screwy motion sicknesses on each blink would be OK.\nTwo, the price.

The blink movement mechanic (with directional selection) took some practice, but once used to it I found little issue exploring.  The puzzles weren't overblown and felt attached to the narrative, each leaving me with a smile on my face.  The story told is a launching off point to a bigger tale and delivers a satifying first episode; leaving me excited for the next one by the time the credits rolled.\n\nMy only criticism is that sometimes I didn't notice the colour outline on objects and had to trial and error to see if it was something I could store in my backpack.  Perhaps more distinct/customized colour choices could help in future episodes.\n\nAlso note that this game is definitely on the higher-end graphical scale, so you'll want to tweak your graphical settings to ensure you're not dropping frames.

I played it for longer than a couple of hours and spent a lot of time searching for things and completing some of the achievements. The inventory system is easily the best I've seen so far in VR, the camera repositioning/blink system is incredibly good (if slightly confusing at first and a little wiggy on inclines), and the graphics are very good at highest settings for a first-generation title.\n\nHaving that said, I am a 30-year-old gamer and have been an ardent comic book, fantasy, and sci-fi geek my entire life. And what I experienced tonight in Call of the Starseed reduced me to tears when I finished the game. When the credits finished and the game closed out, I took off the headset and sat in the dark, openly weeping with happiness.\n\nI won't spoil it for any of you, but the experience was equivalent to being a child and seeing Stargate for the first time, at the moment when Jackson first sees the Stargate activate and walks through it. Or the first time you saw The Goonies and they found the bottom of the Wishing Well. Or like the first time you played Myst and were swept away by the fantasy of discovering the secrets of the ages. The elation and fear of the unknown, and the sense of impending adventure... it came crashing down on me so suddenly and overwhelmingly that I completely lost my sense of self.\n\nFor people the need a TL;DR:\n\nPROS:\n- *Excellent* presentation\n- Detailed environments\n- Interesting puzzles\n- Voice acting, audio, and music are splendid\n- Inventory and blink movement systems are easily among the best in VR to-date\n- Achievements!\n- The beginnings of what promises to be an excellent and engaging story\n- No motion sickness during moving bits (Elevators, etc.)\n\nCONS:\n- Hand tracking will (very rarely) spaz out for a half-second\n- Blink movement will sometimes wig out on inclines or too close to walls, which can be disorienting\n- Short length, if you're rushing through it. (I recommend taking your time)\n- Pricey for the length, but it's VERY polished for a first generation title\n- Physics for loose, thrown, or falling items can sometimes be a little wonky.\n- Graphically intensive. Ran perfectly on 980ti at highest settings, might need to go lower with other GPUs\n- Accidentally forgot my in-game hands weren't real and punched myself in the face with the Vive controller while reaching for my backpack\n\nTL;DR: The first title I've played for the Vive that truly made me forget about reality and engaged me on such a deep level that it stirred profound emotions and reminded me why I love gaming.

The game has a very noticeable level of polish and production values, and the visual quality is probably the best I've seen in the Vive so far. There's a lot of things in the environment that can be interacted with, and even if something isn't related to a puzzle it can be a lot of fun just messing with things, like throwing beer cans at rocks and watching them fizz around or cooking popcorn on a campfire. As a first episode of a larger series, a typical playthrough will last maybe 1 or 2 hours, but it can easily go more depending on how much you like to interact with the environment. My only complaint is that the checkpoint system is somewhat lacking, and if you encounter a bug or something that makes you quit the game you can sometimes find yourself replaying a lot of gameplay, particularly in the longer early areas.

It is a story, a good one, before you play this: turn off your phone, turn off steam notification, decouple your door bell. Proceed to play the game in one go. It will take 2-3 hours.\n\nI don't want to say to much about the game itself, it would be spoiling it like a good book or film. But it start on a beach and ends somewhere you have never been before. On the way you will discover audiologs, do puzzles and play around with objects and the environment.\n\n\nVR technical:\n- The world is gorgeous!\n- When you get to close to walls, your vision starts to blur. At some spots it maybe starts to blur a bit too quick.\n- The ingame movement is a blinking system, you can even rotate your play area.\n- There is some automatic height adjustments which is quite uncomfortable. So avoid walking on and off ledges, but just blink. There was one point where I went to close to a ledge to look down and I sort of fell to area below. I had to take a breather to get back on my feet. (Devs try to look at these high adjustment mechanics because they could probably improve)\n- There is tutorial area which teaches you how to blink and interact with object, which is quite good but doesn't take to long if you already know all this stuff.\n- Moving object around can be a bit flaky and could use some work. Somehow it was quite common to bump the controllers together. Mainly because I wanted to try and manipulate items with two hands, which is not possible.","April 22","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There has been a resurgence of adventure games recently with Telltale's series and Life Is Strange. This game harkens back more to those adventure games of the 90s that LucasArts used to make, and the popular Myst series. There is still a strong narrative but it doesn't take as much focus as the more recent adventure offerings which are often small bits of gameplay peppered around long cutscenes and NPC dialogue. Here the emphasis is more on environmental storytelling, with additional exposition being delivered via cassette tapes you'll (perhaps inexplicably) find around the game, and traditional NPC dialogue.\n\nThe game has some of the best interaction with objects I've seen in a game. Most objects you can find in the game are able to picked up, and the way your virtual hands interact with them feel very natural. This game also has the best virtual inventory system I've seen in a game; you pull a backpack out from behind your back and reach to grab the items you want from it. If you want to stow something into your backpack, whilst holding the item you reach behind your back. The occasional puzzles you encounter in the game use this excellent interaction model to great effect.\n\nThis is one of the best launch titles for VR, highly polished with about two hours of content. So the question is is it worth it? Currently it is one of the highest priced games on Steam for VR. Personally I felt the price was worth it, but that opinion is coloured by virtue of this being a VR game. If this was not a VR game, I feel like this game would be better priced at about $20 for the episode. I don't think you can disregard the VR because right now the audience for VR is very small and the developers likely need to charge a higher price to compensate for smaller sales. If you're looking for a VR adventure game in the vein of Myst or The Dig, then I recommend this. If you're on the fence, it might be worth waiting to see how future episodes are reviewed or for price drops.","April 13","true","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's probably the best "story-driven" game that's available on the HTC Vive right now.\n\nHere are a couple things that disappointed me:\n\n- Lack of subtitles. I'm not a native English speaker and I had some trouble understanding some of the dialogue.\n- The game adjusting your height if you move around on sloped terrain. It's really disorientating. I understand why it's like that but it breaks the feeling of presence.\n- It's a little expensive for the length, about 2 hours. That said I understand that for a production value of this caliber, and with VR having such a small market base right now, that's a necessary compromise. It was a bit disappointing since the game ends in the middle of a really amazing moment. I also see the "expensiveness" of this as a way to support the funding of the future episodes, so I'm okay with this.\n\nOverall I would absolutely recommend this game unless you were really short on money, but if you bought a VR headset anyway you probably aren't... so go for it!","April 27","true","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Even admiring the beautiful environments didn't get me more than about an hour and a half of game time with no replayability beyond admiring the quality of the production.

What a brilliant game! Immersive! The mood set by each "scene" is incredible, where I was properly on edge in certain parts. I had tingles in a lot of it, and it is the only/first game for the Vive that made me jump... Stupid glowstick falling into water behind me...\n\nThe story is very well put together, the characters are really well acted/fleshed out considering the minimal contact you have with them. I can't really explain how effective it is.\n\nConsidering the graphics, the performance of the game is great. I've had so many problems with other Unity games, but this one ran nicely on a R9 290, i5 6600k. Maybe 5 dropped frames the entire time. I did run the game on low, mind, but it still looked great :)\n\nMy only critical review point would be about the backpack. I found myself struggling to juggle 2 items then get the backpack out etc. I don't know how I would improve it though, it was just too real :P\n\nI haven't finished the game yet, but I'm already happy with the purchase. The amount of quality content is 10x to 100x that of a lot of £15 games for the Vive, and I feel bad that the devs are getting negative reviews about the price. My argument goes: at least 5 games in the top 20 Vive games are a single scene, with low quality content but good replayability. Now those are great games and they absolutely have a place, but charging £10-£15 for them just seems wrong when put up against disproportionately  high quality content like this.\n\nAnyway, I hope the next episodes are quick for the devs to produce as they have the format, interactions, optimisations all down now. I'll be buying the next episode and cannot wait.","April 30","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If there ends up being 10 episodes (each lasting about an hour), that would be €300 with no price reduction, and I just can't see them charging that much for a bundle.\n\nSo I was going to wait to buy it, but people kept saying: "OMG, the last 10-15 minutes are amazing! This is exactly what is finally made possible by VR!" and I was like: "Ah, that sounds like there's a big twist! I better experience the first big VR twist and have my mind blown, before someone spoils it!" I had all kinds of ideas for twists that could only be done in VR where you suddenly realize everything is different than what you thought.\n\nWell, there's no twist. This is fine, since it's only the very first part of a story, so it doesn't need a twist. But that means it can't be spoiled, so you don't have to buy this now. You're not taking any risk. There's no chance of you having your experienced ruined, because of something you hear or read somewhere.\n\nAs many other people have pointed out, everything is high quality, but the game contains one actual puzzle that will take you more than 30 seconds to solve and you will likely finish the entire game in an hour. (I spent longer than that due to technical problems. If you have a GTX 780 make sure you downgrade to driver version 364.51 before playing. This will fix the chaperone frame drop problems.)\n\nSo, I would definitely recommend you wait for a sale or for a bundle with multiple episodes to come out before you buy this.

It really has some amazing wow moments, and a few really cool mechanics.  While watching the trailer you do see most of what happens in the game, just not in VR which is a world of difference.  The biggest gripe is not being sure what the future episodes are going to cost.  If the are $5 or so each, I will certainly feel they are worth it.  If they are $30, they are not getting any more of my money unless they take 10+ hours to complete.  I have a total of 2.3 hours on this game.  Like most players, it wasn't really due to the content taking that long.  I did a demo of the game, as well as got lost in the sewers by going the wrong way, which took up some time.  Really, if you do know how to complete it, there is only 30-40 minutes of game play.  The puzzles really are pretty basic.\n\nIn a lot of ways, this shows the potential of VR.

But, I also ran into some bugs that broke immersion and also made me kinda motion sick.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Intersting story\n- Nice Audio in general\n- The backpack storage is cool/better than traditional menus/ect.\n- Some nice iteraions with objects/environment.\n\n\nThe Not So Good/Bugs:\n\n- Blink Navigation (Default Settings) felt a bit clunky to me.    Trying to rotate the teleport space was a little akward with the touch pad, but that's maybe a hardware/firmware issue.   Also aiming with your head is awkward/kinda uncomfortable.  I really like how Valve had it setup, where you aim with the controller, and press the touch pad to instantly teleport.  You have a delay in this game, as you "walk" to the teleport area or something.\n\n- Some of the env. art felt a bit in-consistent.   The last env. felt pretty rough.  Geo wasn't too bad, but the textures looked almost placeholder/temp.  Lower res/too large of UV scale/noitceable seams/ect.\n\n- In multiple cases, when I leaned my body left/right, the whole world seemed to move up and down or something. Which started to get me a little motion sick/unstable.  It wouldn't always move, and in some cases only 1-2".  But the worst was when it moved 6" to 1ft, and I really started to feel un-easy.  Not sure if a bug or what.\n\n- When I loaded into an area once, maybe since I teleported into a doorway before the load, the loading icon/menu was broken, and I saw 3 large grey planes infront of me.\n\n- In multiple cases, the Flare Gun ammo got stuck floating in the air attached to my gun.  Or I couldn't drop the ammo/interact anymore.  So I had to load it into the gun to get rid of it, or shoot my flare gun till empty, then reload.\n\n- The backpack, while cool, wouldn't get put away many times, when I thought it did.  So I started to walk away, and it was floating there yet.   Or I could try to drop items into it over my shoulder, and it would miss and fall to the ground.  Unless I wasn't doing something right.\n\n- The game is very short.  Depending how fast you solve the puzzles.  But, even still maybe only 2-3 hours long.\n\n- The env was very linear/not really much to explore or checkout.   I probably wouldn't play through a second time. Unless to show friends/ect.\n\n","May 9","false","2.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

How this didn't cause red flags in QA, I don't know. It feels horrible... so much that you have to limit any moving around and teleport everywhere, which broke my immersion.\n\nPros\n- Good art direction, sound and music\n- Really inventive inventory system\n- Some really cool visual moments in the last third\n\nI would probably normally return this game because I am under the refund time limit, but I would like to support VR developers in this new market.

The problem is that the world raises/lowers based on the position of the headset. Since most of the ground is sloped, shifting your weight or leaning/etc causes the world to raise/lower. Also with the winding map, you're constantly having to turn around and reorient yourself after teleporting. There are a lot of objects close to your player, which isn't comfortable on a Vive. The 'sweet spot' for view distance on a Vive/Rift is at least a few feet from your character. I got this weird sensation after taking it off when physical objects that were close to me felt too close, since the Vive renders near objects as a few feet away. I also found myself impaled by objects several times while teleporting from room to room. That's a little awkward when you're already starting to feel sick.\n\nOverall, a high quality game but they need to apply some VR learnings to their level design. I'll try to work through the rest of this game in small chunks.

On the one hand, it was lovingly crafted, with lots of little details and a great interface and UI. The time I spent with it was enjoyable, and it felt more like a tripple A game than most launch VR titles do... but on the other, it's so pathetically, laughably short for an adventure game it is insulting to those who pay good money for it. There isn't a whole lot here that isn't what you'd expect from an adventure game, but there's so LITTLE of it is what makes it a problem.\n\nThe story barely, BARELY gets started. If this was a book it would have ended halfway through the prologue, it's that short! I don't know what else I can compare it to, but the length is just plain a joke. Is the story good? Who knows? There isn't even a ghost of enough of it here to be able to tell. Should we be excited for the next chapter? Who knows? This one is so short we barely got past the title before it was over.\n\nA serious player can beat this in well under an hour. The only reason I have as much playtime as I do on record is because I spent an unusually long time playing around with the environment... and despite the shortness, I managed to find a bug that wasted my time for over an hour by denying me a clue that was floating around that I needed to progress.\n\nI hate to harp on how short it is but I just can't get past it. To put it another way, fire up an episodic game from Telltale. Watch the intro. Now play for fifteen minutes. Stop, and that's about how much is here. Now look at what they are charging for this. Can this content possibly justify the price? Another way to put it, there are so few areas for screenshots, the store page actually has one from the tutorial room that has nothing whatsoever to do with the game, other than forced padding! That's some seriously bad form.\n\nIs this a cynical cash grab from a company that is exploiting the launch of VR by overcharging for a glorified demo because they know people will buy it due to the lack of titles at launch? I hope not, because I'd heard from the developer and thought they were more passionate about the project than that. More likely, it wasn't anywhere near completed, but the April 5th launch of the Vive was coming close, and they had to lock down what little they had completed and publish.\n\nI love the quality on display. I love the interface and gameplay, and I'd love to play a full-length adventure game using the systems developed here. It hurts me to have to bash something so polished, and I really, really want to give it a good review... But I cannot, and will not overlook the insane price being charged for a piece of game that is so short it is outpaced by demos on the old PC Gamer disks from the 90s.","April 21","false","3.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Although deeply flawed in its \'blink\' locomotion mechanic, low graphical fidelity, and short length, the 15 straight minutes of shivers sent down my spine during the latter end of the game made every penny worth it.

The assets are incredibly detailed, physics are great, story is good so far. The enviroments are quite immersive, the begining beach scene is almost relaxing, I kinda just chilled there for a bit. If your into adventure and crave to see what future VR games might be like then buy it. For everyone else.. wait for a sale ^^. btw devs.. the hand motion is so realistic.. watching 'my' hand as i grip, so immersive. Silly but it makes a big difference.","June 3","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So regardless of the price, I do feel like it's worth the experience because it is amazing. I would put this right behind Vanishing Realms which is my #1.","June 2","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, the way they took that concept and adapted it to tell a story so well in VR, so immersive that you forget where you are and become part of the story is just mindblowing.\n\nThis game is a must get if you like story driven games. You will not be dissapointed.\n\nKeep in mind that each episode sells separately, so it might take a hit to your wallet. Try to think of it as supporting a new platform. The entry cost is usually higher for first adopters :D","June 4","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The world is lush and immersive. The blinking movement gets a little clunky navigating around in tight spaces. And... there will probably be at least one time when you are stuck in the games progress and unable to tell if you are experiencing a game bug or a hardware bug. The fuse box puzzle part of the story is a little frustrating, but once you get through it the pay off is worth it.","June 5","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
