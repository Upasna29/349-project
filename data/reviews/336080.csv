The game tries to depict a complex conflict in a very simple way and is not unsuccessful.\n\nPros:\n\n- Despite its simplicity, it managed to capture a few basic tenants of COIN warfare, such as “Partisans win just by surviving and remaining active”.\n- The game is constituted of 3 different factors: local sentiments, military situation and the opinion of your higher-ups in Washington. All 3 influence one another in a way that is more subtle than it seems.\n- The “search” part of COIN warfare is there and it is most often more important and more difficult than the "destroy" part.\n- The unit list is limited, but each one has its specific purpose.\n- Maps are randomly generated, and this really does increase replay ability, even in some basic strategic choices remain the same.\n- You win by influencing the local population, rather than through controlling territory.\n- Overall the game is engaging and invites the player to think a few moves ahead. The basic design means that there is always a level of uncertainty of what the enemy is up to.\n\nCons:\n\n- The game is a "Top-down design" and quite abstracted. The combat mechanics are simple (think old Panzer General). This is not necessarily bad in itself, but people who expected combat complexity on the level of "The Operational Art of War III" will certainly be disappointed. More depth when it comes to actual combat and units could enhance the game and this is where there is room for improvement.\n- Each unit is about the size of a platoon and your entire force will be max about the size of a regiment. You fight to control one valley, not a whole province. As such, there is no finer elements of politics and historical events, such as South Vietnamese coups, attacks on provincial capitals etc.\n- While the Political-Military-Local sentiments score is not a bad idea, it leaves some elements to be counterintuitive or unrealistic (why does NVA deathtoll increase local support for example?)\n- You can play only as the US, no possibility to play as the communist side. So far no multiplayer\n- The NVA AI may decide to send in some PT-76 tanks, which is ahistorical\nas far as 1965 is concerned.\n- The randomized map while helping with replay value, does not offer any historical background.\n- The sounds are generic ad there is no period music in the game. I ended up turning sounds of and playing Vietnam-era American music mixes from YouTube. This is a strategy game, so its not a major issue but still I'd like to point this out.\n- Its a game designed for mobile devices and it shows on the PC.\n\nFinal verdict: The game succedes in simulating the basic tenants of COIN operations quite well, which is not something most wargames do. It could use more depth as far as unit types, public relations, historical events or civil aid programs are concerned. This is a game with Panzer General (or even below given limited unit variety) -level combat complexity and if you are willing to treat it as such, the game can be rewarding and fun.\n\nMore in-depth description of some core gameplay mechanics.\n\nHigher relations with the locals will allow you to detect the ennemy more easily, which in turn will allow you to detroy them getting positive political clout in washington. On the other hand, losing units will cost you political clout and allowing VC to run around villages will lower the opinions of the locals - which in turn makes it harder to spot saidVC, which in turn makes it harder to prevent them from lowering the local sentiments even more.\n\nThe partisans can win just by not losing, the COIN force needs to actively win in order not to lose. This game really depicts this well. A lack of sucess mans that you can end up in a spiral of dropping political support and local opinions, which in turn make military victories harder and harder.\n\nThe map is randomly generated each game, which helps the replay factor more than it seems. The game is low-scale though, so you will not get any game changing hstorical events.\n\nEngineers are an important part of the game and your strategy will certainly include building new firebases, clearng jungle and building roads.","March 5, 2015","true","48.6"," 120 of 149 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","120","149","6","1"

For the last decade America has been ratcheting up her presence in the troubled region while France and Japan watch on knowingly, having tried to woo Vietnam with guerrilla warfare and baguettes in the past. And while America too would become weary and stop her particular explod-y romancing, 1965 was just the beginning of serious courtship. But enough with this weird sexy subtext history lesson, how's the game?\n\nThe game starts off giving you an overview map of the (procedurally generated) Ia Drang Valley. You have a base on one end of the map, and the rest of the map is populated with little villages and forests full of Charlie. From that base you deploy infantry, army engineers, helicopters, tanks... pretty much anything and everything to change the tide, and move them across the hex grid. You build roads and tear down forest to better navigate, you search for mines and set up ambushes, you build forward and fire bases, and you resupply your units in the field. All the while you have to juggle political capital to keep the war going, and that capital is affected by how successful your efforts are in putting down NVA, Vietcong, and turning the local populace to your cause. Some very cool ideas happening here, including the political capital, “hearts and minds” thing, the fact that your military accomplishments and achievements are displayed on a uniform, and the fact that you have to build equal parts to explode.\n\nBUT.\n\nBut. These things happen seemingly arbitrarily (seemingly, anyway. Apparently troop levels, American and communist, influence sympathies). Some villages raised American flags in support while others chose the communist North, for reasons not entirely clear initially. Enemies pop in and out of nowhere (an interesting way to depict the guerrilla warfare that marked the conflict, but it just looks lazy and rushed. The developer has told me they appear on the Ho Chi Minh trail so it isn't at random per se, but they still will just materialize as if out of nothing). And the resupplying gets real old real fast, flying choppers sometimes every three turns to feed your hungry units in the field. It's boring, monotonous, repetitive, and tiresome. You play the game once, you've played it a dozen times.\n\nVietnam '65  is a lot like something you download from the App Store, play in the airport while you wait for a flight, and promptly delete after a game or two – all the while muttering how you need to manage your money better, how eight dollars here and eight dollars there add up eventually, how you could have read a book and bettered yourself. Maybe you start crying and people start recording you on their phones and you're a reluctant viral sensation – I've lost my train of thought again.\n\nThe game doesn't just FEEL like a tired App Store game, it looks the part too. Sharp, PS1 textures and models, awkward, janky movements, bad tutorial, poorly explained mechanics, one game type, an options menu that allows you to change the volume and admire the developer credits. It's just lame, it's pathetic, and  in a market full of classic and brave new strategy games, why bother with this drek? Even for you history buffs out there, this isn't the Vietnam War game that breaks the crappy mold.\n\nAvoid this one. When there's literally dozens of amazing strategy games out there right now for the taking, why bother with bad, lazy iPad ports?","March 5, 2015","false","3.4"," 315 of 446 people (71%) found this review helpful 85 people found this review funny","71","315","446","85","22"

The war for hearts and minds had to be won. When I saw the battlefield my heart sank. My only advantage lay in five villages near my HQ along a dirt-track road. If I could control this line of villages, I could secure the Northern half of the territory. However, almost 2/5 of the map cut off from my influence by a meandering river. Four cities lay on the other side. Cities I needed to take.\n\nAnd so I created a forward base along the track and began recruiting a flurry of new conscripts. We'd win this war by placing a permenant garrison in every single town.\n\nAmbitious? Hell yeah.\nSuccessful? Hell yeah!\n\nOur operation kicked off to a major success, the five villages near me were within the influence of the pro-US AVRN. A great start! One village even gave information leading to our first successful firefight against the VC. Support for the war was increasing at home!\n\nFor thirty turns I drastically expanded the size of my airforce, hiring hueys and a chinook to ferry supplies to my vast army. Firebases were established to ease the burden of supplying my troops that my brave pilots faced. The occassional helicopter took an RPG hit, but we hadn't yet lost any. It was now turn 36 and support was running at 71 for the US government. Every village in the map had been brought under our influence. Minefields were routinely being located and destroyed, villages gave up VC rebels which we made short work of with our fighter-jets.\n\nWhy on Earth did I ever think this war would be difficult?\n\nThen my engineers hit a minefield. No big deal, I can ferry them back to HQ next-\n\n*BOOM*\n\nAn RPG hits the Chinook heading over to rescue them.\n\n*BOOM*\n\nA second RPG hits my already damaged huey sending it spiralling out of control and crashing into the ground.\n\nWaves of Viet Cong guerillas ambush and wound two of my squads, putting extra pressure on my choppers to ferry them back before body bags start heading to the US mainland.\n\nA couple of turns more and disaster continues to ramp up. The North Vietnamese Army joins the fight en masse, swarming over the border.\n\nIt's turn 42 now; APC's and waves of infantry have broken my hold on the three Westernmost towns. My popularity in the opinion polls is barely scraping 70 again. Almost every soldier on the front line is badly wounded and I'm continuing to expose my remaining choppers to greater and greater risks to ferry back the wounded to my command station.\n\nI debate abandoning the four most Western towns and one of my fire bases, just so I can redraw a more firm defence line a few clicks back.\n\n*BOOM*\n\nA wounded squad manages to take out the North Vietnamese Army's APC, only to be overrun seconds later by two squads of Vietnamese soldiers. At least they stunted the brunt of the attack.\n\nAnd then it happened. Turn 45.\n\nThe war was over. Things almost fell apart towards the end, but I had been rewarded, the 'man in every village' plan had worked in stopping the VC. My brave recruits, combined with the AVRN's that my Green Beret's trained managed to hold every village for almost the whole game, with only a single APC for armoured support.\n\n9/10 would Decisive Victory again!","March 7, 2015","true","20.5"," 70 of 93 people (75%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","75","70","93","16","1"

It sustained numerous attacks from VC and NVA (including tanks).  Whatever I put there, SF, INF, ARVN would take casualties.  So there is a constant ferrying of troops in and out of the area via Huey and M113.  The helicopters occasionally get damaged as well by RPG attacks.  I placed an arty there but being so far from the Main Base means it takes a lot of time for it receive ammo.  So it was quite useless at times especially during the intense attacks.   When I finally got a tank and sent it there, time ran out for it to see some real action.  I won the campaign (normal difficulty) anyway with 60+ "hearts and minds".\n\nThis game captures the feel of 'Nam nicely.  And there is a big emphasis on logistics.  Don't be fooled by the price.

This seems to have, among other things, added some options to tweak the game settings on a new game and therefore probably helped with variation.\n\nMy major complaint is a lack of replayability. The new patch will likely help with that but, for the price, it still leaves only a single scenario. If you wanted to improve that the best method would be a simple campaign or two and really that isn't a huge amount of work. Essentially you'd just need to have a pre-made map/pre-placed units and certain restrictions/changes for each faction or in the weather etc for each mission (you could, in fact, just set the map generation options and unit-type limits for each mission and still have it semi-randomised). Throw a little piece of text (no voice acting required) to lead into the mission and you're done. You could do everything from time-limited standard operations, defence missions and even pitched battles. While, on paper, it looks the same as just having the user generate their own scenario it really helps give the game some length.\n\nThe second real issue (and what makes it only mildly entertaining) is the seemingly arbitrary nature of some of the gameplay. From what I've read it appears that everything is actually happening for a solid reason but this reason is almost completely behind the scenes. A slight increase in feedback about why certain things are happening would help.\n\nOtherwise there isn't anything hugely wrong with the game. The units are a little unbalanced (from what I remember APCs weren't great while tanks and particularly helicopter gunships were too effective). Infantry are actually the biggest annoyance due to their constant resupply needs and slow movement etc. These points are again based on an older version of the game and might have been due to a lucky map.\n\nAdding scenarios with changing limits would help here too as it allows you to limit access to certain units or toy with their effectiveness.\n\nFinally larger maps to allow for longer games would be nice though that might require some changes to the cost/upkeep of units and limits on their price increases. The current size of maps doesn't help the general impression of a tablet game ported directly to the PC.","July 22, 2015","false","2.2"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","25","37","2","4"

I hope others will weigh in and this will turn into a really fun game.  Currently, I see little replay value.\n\nReview after 8 hours.  I played the tutorial and three missions on easy mode.\n\nYou fight one tactical scenario/battle after another, each is generated predurally and game play does not vary, so limited replay.  If you like turn based tactical battles, this has potential but needs further development.\n\nPROS:\n- good graphics\n- easy UI (except at times the popup radial menu hides hexes you are trying to click on)\n- good AI (I am playing on easiest level and did not win the tutorial the first time, so tactics will take time to learn)\n- turned based strategy (gotta love it)\n- I am a supporter of war games and of Slitherine, the Lords, Matrix Games, and other small, independent development teams making war games, so please help support them.  Keep up the good works guys!\n- no bugs.\n\nCONS:\n- No Undo button. It is such a pain to fight a battle for an hour and then due to a misclick get screwed because you can't undo an errant click that had no affect on anything.  If they add an Undo button, or an alert to warn you not to run out of fuel with the helecopters that solves most of this issue..\n- For example, it is too easy to click on a helocopter that is low on fuel and accidentally move it too far and it runs out of fuel and crashes the next turn. Seriously, how often did a fleet of helocopters run out of fuel and crash? Never. This needs to be fixed with some sort of warning.\n- Your experienced troops do stay with you and roll over to the next scenario.  I don't think there is a campaign, jut the same battle over and over? So lacking in any RPG feature.\n- The constant requirement to keep resupplying units, while I understand is integral to the game, is a bit harsh if you forget to resupply a unit, it is totally lost. I think it would be better if the unit could not move until resupplied and if attacked suffered total loss, or maybe just suffered a 50% hit like in combat.\n- Not much diversity in troops, having more diversity would be fun, e.g., Marines, Riverboats, Paratroopers, Napalm flights, but this is due to my love of tactical level and this is more operational level and I believe modeled after a specific piece of geography and unit history (i.e., not in the Delta).\n- Seeing faint hex grid would be nice so can count artillery distance before building a fire base.","March 8, 2015","false","8.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","7"

I'm going to give a quick review and get right to the points.   Now I'm getting a start to this review since I only made it through the first tutorial because I played it out to the end which is 45 turns.  I was thinking there would be some achievement but there wasn't one  I also noticed that there was no progression after the tutorial.  So it's not worth playing it tout to the end.  this is for all the achievment hunter save some time\n\nPro's  and con's (After playing just the tutorial)  The game really puts you in command of an Area of operation.  The down fall is that the Controls will frustrate you.  Example Click a Huey  send it to a base to refuel well if it still able to move after reaching the base it will remain active. So when you go to click on another unit that Huey will move out of position and it runs out of fuel the next turn it will crash.  This applies to all units.\n\nNow there is no economy to worry about, You buy troops with political favor, the more units you have the less favor you carry.  Now for every unit or base you kill you gain political favor and support with the locals.  every unit you lose, lowers your favor and can slow your progress.\n\nOk Nothing below was explained or was really light on detail You have 3 types of basesYour Command center has  four functions\nAllows you to heal ground troops and provides you the supplies for all troops.\nAllows Helicopters to refuel.\nAllows you the buy/create new troops.\nAllows you to set up artilleryYour fire base (is your 2nd main base)\nProvides you the supplies for all Infanty and Engineer's.\nProvides a place for Helicopters to refuel.\nProvides you a location to set up artilleryOutposts have 2 functions\nAllows you to set up artillery\nAllows your Green berets to train Arvn forces.  This caused me to lose more troops during the tutorial then anything.\n\nSupply line management Planning your distance will greatly help your supply lines, rotate troops off the front lines.\nBut also your artillary can only be set up at bases and they provide your troops fire support support.\n\nSo far its not that bad of a game but there is a good learning curve, while some might get it quicker then others. by all means this shouldn't scare you away from a small little game.  It's not fancy in the graphics department, but it really tries to capture the Essence of what it was like for are troops fighting over in Vietnam.  You'll  have no clue who or where the enemy is an at the beginning of every turn you Intel of potential  enemy activity that shows up on the map.  Guess what they could be there or not, this bring another depth of realism because your intel could be good or bad, hell you could even be ambushed, hit a mine field in an area you already cleared.  Even how the enemy forces fight NVA will always stand and fight while the VC will hit and run, or you just might have a squad or rpg that shoot at your helocopters then disapear.  The enemy can pop up anywhere no matter what you control or cleared on the map.","February 24","true","20.6"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","19","28","3","1"

This is more Unity of Command style abstraction.\nSecondly, don't expect a typical (i.e. 4X) TBS game approach either.\n\nVietnam '65 is a different style of strategy game. You don't push out from your base in order to push your opponent back into his. Map control is still very important, but your opponent is fluid and the jungle is his friend. Enemies might appear at a village you thought was secure or your brand new tank might roll into a minefield way before he can get to where the action is 'meant' to be. Your infantry will hunker down in your Forward Operating Bases whilst your Special Forces prowl the jungle on recon missions. You'll frantically call in artillery strikes to try and save an ambushed unit of Infantry, or howl in despair as an RPG ambush downs your Chinook, as your units will now not get the supplies they desperately need this turn!\n\nThe game manages to capture the pitfalls of fighting such a war quite well, and despite the price there is a remarkable level of depth in there. That being said, once you've grasped the rules and basics, I've found the game a little easy. I'd like the AI to thwart me utterley from time to time. Again though, that being said, you will easily get your money's worth of entertainment at such a price point. I hope that the success of this game will spur the developers onto much more ambitious plans. The asymmetric nature of the war depicted in this game could be really good for multiplayer (or even a pausable real time strategy using something like Eugen's IrisZoom engine, wow! I can dream)\n\nIn summary, a great little game for the price point.

At first I was skepitcal because it looked more like a mobile game that lacked depth. After playing quite a few games now I can see firsthand that there is a lot to learn.\n\nHere is a run down of my only victory so far:\n\nIn the middle of the map I setup a Firebase to help support forces further away from the main base. I had troops constantly heading to all nearby villages to check for intel.\nGreen beret's in the woods to locate any VC or NVA forces trying to flank.\n\nAfter creating a forward base on the opposite side of the map and having it attacked repeatedly I decided to take action;\nSetting infantry squads to ambush enemy troops around areas where contact was previously made.\nHave reaction forces able to move in by huey's if contact is made to try to cut off the enemy's escape.\nA Cobra gunship on standby if support is needed.\n\nThis stopped enemy forces assaulting my forward base, gave me map control and allowed me to move troops to the local villages.\n\nAfter this game I tried veteren.. long story short I ended up with the last few remaining troops in my base, my green berets on patrol locating enemy forces moving in so I could hit them with artillery and air strikes. They were everywhere and I could only try to hold out until the 45 turns were up and try not to be over run.\n\nThis game may look simple but there are a number of different tactics to try, and every game you play will have a different map making the replay value huge! The game is largely about logistics, positions troops and making sure they stay supplied. Like in real life, you can't just let troops wander around without food/ammo and you will have to make decisions. Keep your troops out in the field, patrol or ambush, do you get a supply run to them or just pick them up and take them back to base? Is the path clear or is there a good chance you'll run into enemy forces with RPG's that will try to shoot down your supply chopper, which could result in losing the chopper and the infantry unit it was supplying.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun and the more I play, the more fun I am having. For the asking price you will get a lot of play time out of it and the devs are very active on the forum and listening to what people want to have added to the game. As a starting point the game is great, and with updates and additional content coming, this will be a game worth trying out.","March 12, 2015","true","30.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","3"

And it is.  The game mechanics are easy to learn and the interface is very friendly.  The unit types are basic but fairly accurate and once you move onto Veteran the gameplay becomes quite a bit more challenging.  That said, it still seems overly easy to win a decisive victory.  I have found in my own games that mechanised infantry and armour can be totally ignored, in favor of plenty of heli-transport and cobra gunships backing up the boys on the ground.  I only use the Green Berets for recce duties, not training, and reserve airstrikes for bases, enemy armour and RPG teams out of reach of other assets.  Engineers clear LZ's next to villages without one and also form LZ's in dense jungle areas for sweeps and clear duties or recce insertion.  Placing your fire base well, so it can cover several high value areas, is critical.  Ideally, it wants to be within chinook range of your HQ, for rapid casevac and artillery replenishment.  So far, that has paid off well.\n\nThis game is fun, easy to learn and play, and highlights one fact better than almost anything I have ever played.

Since December 1964 the South Vietnamese army repeatedly suffered major defeats against North Vietnam, to the point of breaking.\n\nTo prevent that a first deployment of just 3500 Marines in a defensive role in March '65, quickly escalated to 200.000 GI's by December '65. Marking the beginning of a full grown offensive ground war, of the US and his allies, against North Vietnam. In a plan to destroy the enemy and his infrastructure in 12 to 18 month.\n10 years and 1 month later at April 30th 1975, the last US Soldiers left Vietnam by the largest helicopter evacuation in history.\n\nThis game recapture the events starting in November '65. When the US for the fist time implement Air-mobility doctrine & Air-Assault tactics. Trying to hunt down enemy forces and interrupt supply lines (Ho-Chi-Minh Path, HCMP), in even the most remote parts of Vietnam. By deploying, supporting and extracting an entire Battalion size force just by helicopters. Making the Bell UH-1D Iroquois (Huey) the maybe most iconic helicopter in the world.\n\nYou got 45 turns to secure the valley running from the Cambodian border, and win the hearth & minds of the civilian population. Stopping VC reinforcements coming down the Ho-Chi-Minh path, and the NVA from crossing the Cambodian border. Setting up bases and trying to wipe you off the map.\nYou see, it's all easy peasy. ;)\n\nVietnam '65 is certainly one of those addictive easy to learn, but hard to master games. That offer the excitement of a rogue like game. The game seems easy and simple at first, but soon you will find out real thinking and deductive skill are asked for. When trying to figure out the pattern of VC sightings, to pinpoint possible locations of Ho-Chi-Minh trail spawn points across the valley. Then building forward bases in strategic locations, from which your units will operate to lay ambush to any VC coming down the HCMP. Inviting a Claymore mine full of surprises.\n\nFor just $10 bucks this game is not only a bargain, but for me personally already amoung the best strategy games of 2015 with a high re-playability value. Almost like FTL back then.\n\nMovie recommendation: We Were Soldiers (2002)[www.imdb.com] with Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot Madeleine Stowe and Clark Gregg.\nThis movie depicts the first conducted Air-Assault in history, from November 15th to 18th in the La Drang valley (The Valley of Death), near the Cambodian border.

The game takes place in 1965 and you're tasked at the United States to combat the Vietcong and North Vietnamnese Army.  The games combat is pretty much rock, paper, scissor format when factoring unit strengths, health, and supplies.  You must seek and destroy the VC and NVA by dividing and conquering the land given(however, the VC will still conduct raids on you in friendly areas).  While doing this, you must also win the hearts and minds of the people, along with managing your political support at home.  Political support is used to purchase new units, new bases, along with repairing and refueling vehicles.   The game aims to gain victory with hearts and minds by visiting local villages, and destroying the VC and NVA(and negative effects if they kill you!).\n\nThe game is reasonably priced and it has replay value since each map is a little bit different from the other(although the core concepts of the game stay the same regardless).  If you're an enthusiast about the Vietnam War, and enjoy turn-based games, this game is worth a shot, especially for the value.\n\nI wanted to add to the review that the game doesn't have a steep learning curve.

It is all about supporting your bases, and making sure your supplies are in sufficient distances of your combat troops(logistics is extremely important in planning!).

Victory conditions are also different, in that winning does not provide the closure most games have.

Yes if you are a Strategy game fan, the Spawning of VC due to the trail keeps you on your toes and requires a lot of tactical flexibility on the players part.\n\nI thought the balancing in this game was actually well done, unit and tech wise its not too deep but the game will punish you for not taking a tactical approach to the situation and the fact that if you over extend your area of ops without the proper infastructure to support the expansion you will be shooting yourself in the foot by leaving gaps that allow enemy units to slip by undetected and give the VC & NVA a chance to do some serious damage to your forces.\nWith the trail i pinpointed a few locations where enemies would usually appear around, making sure to set up FOB's nearby to cut their numbers down as they arrived.\nThe resupplying does feel a bit boring after a certain point, it would've been cool if you could set certain hueys and Chinooks to auto-supply units when they began to run low on supplies.\n\nThe overall tactical overview of the Vietnam war isn't to do with lighting fast attacks and overwhleming of the enemy from the Americans side due to the fact that they were fighting a ghost force, its meant to seem sneaky, frustrating and dirty.\n\nThat being said it is a bit sore on the eyes and screams ipad/portable port, it also feels way too short and a bit too small in scope for my liking, was hoping more for a long and scrappily fought operation. if it had much more content and was expanded for the PC it would be a helluva lot better o:\n\nIt's not a game that you'll play for weeks upon weeks, its a game that is there for when you are looking to play a bit of strategy but don't want to have to spend hours and hours trying to play a single game.\nComparing it to much larger scale TBS games wouldn't make much sense considering they are two different beasts even though they both inhabit the TBS genre.\n\nFor simply what it is i'd give it a 7/10, if the game was larger in scope and had been expanded upon with it being brought up to PC i'd say it would've scored better around the 7.5-8/10 mark.\nI love all types of strategy games whether they are TBS or RTS so take this review with a pinch of salt if you want or simpily take it for face value.","March 8, 2015","true","6.0"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

You will tire soon and often of watching units die and completely dissapear if you are one turn too late resupplying them...but read on.\n\nEDITED REVIEW: I found their forum and the developers are working to fix their issues. They do realize the constant helicopter resupply of units is completely unrealistic and takes away from the gameplay of an otherwise excellent game.\n\nSome gamers could care less about realism and love this aspect of the game. To them I would say that a lot of truck tires were replaced in VietNam too. Do you want to play a game that requires you to change truck tires every turn?

Often it's an ambush, traps and gathering intel.\nIntel is critical. You get it by moving into populated hexes. However, if you don't actively secure the populated area, the pop become hostile to you and won't feed you any intel.\nIntel is used to reveal VC/NVA units. It's particularly needed for VC units who disband and vanish after setting a successful ambush on your troops. So you have to find them first. NVA is a bit easier because they are conventional and you can chase them later (provided you can divert the firepower to that).\n\nOnce you have your intel, you will have to fall on the VC units. At times, the task is tricky as you may have to drop your infantry into a hot landing zone (where your helicopters are attacked when entering the hex) or you may have to drop your ground troops farther, but then they may lose track of the enemy.\n\nThe other tricky part is the logistics. Refueling armor, giving ammo to arty or supplying infantry, the helicopter is your workhorse. Overextend yourself and you may have unsupplied units. In that game, it means they are eliminated. It isn't sudden, you get warnings. But if you didn't plan, you may not be able to fix the problem in time.\nLogistics is then the backbone of your action. It hints where you should build your firebase and where your firebase is built tells you where you can hope to project your troops.\n\nWhen the situation goes out of hand, you may face troubles : are you going to evac the worn units and their injured, or leave them and haul ammo to the artillery of your firebase instead ?\nThe rotation of helos in the game is actually critical. It is a micro-management system but limited in size. You don't have that many units to handle. But if you hate the idea of being forced to pay attention to supply and ammo and set your resupply carrousel, you may want to look for another game.\n\nFinally, you win or lose based on the "Hearts and Minds" of the local population. Kill the enemy and you improve your rep. Have the enemy move freely around or, worse, destroy a unit of yours, and the locals will stop supporting you.\nYou don't build troops, you request them. The difference lies in battlefield results. Your political support is your currency to ask for new troops. The more you win, the more support you get. On the opposite, if you lose...\nGetting new units is more and more expensive. Mostly, you get to conduct your whole operation with not much more than the starting troops. You may replace units, get a few new ones but that's all.\nYour Green Berets can recruit ARVN units. ARVN troops don't cost your political support. They are also better at getting intel from the locals. But they are weaker than the regular US troops. training ARVN troops also requires a forward base. Just setting one, where and when, can be a little challenge.\n\nUltimately, you win or lose the game by decimating the enemy. Logistics, intel, it's all about being able to know where to strike and being able to strike.\nSometimes you win after a bloodbath where the VC and the NVA bleed themselves against your bases. Sometimes you win with a combination of patrolling and securing plus a handful of aggressive moves.\nSometimes, it just snowballs out of control, from an array of VC attacks to NVA armor coming across the border.\n\nThe game is simple but efficient. It has a bit more depth than it looks. Difficulty also depends a lot on map layout (you can also somewhat decide the map style when starting a game).\nReplayabiliity is debatable. Some players will enjoy the same mechanics on a different map each time. Others will look for scenarios and all and there the game is lacking.\nIt's remotely historical but gives you a good feeling of what can be airmobile operations in Vietnam.\nThe price tag is still a bit high.","February 24","true","13.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game is deceptively complex, whilst on paper you think "Oh i'll just post troops in every village, gather intel and crush the enemy", in practice it's a bit harder. Some villages may be uncooperative, or the helicopter ferrying your troops to a village may be attacked forcing a hasty retreat lest that helicopter be ambushed again, and you have to keep those troops supplied which means you'll need a fleet of helicopters, your base may be too far to efficiently ferry supplies and men so you need to build bases closer which need to be defended from VC or NVA assault.\n\nMy only major gripe is that currently the game is somewhat unclear about combat, only giving a % based chance that you'll successfully engage and destroy that enemy with no info on what factors increases or decreases your chances, although I do believe that this is being fixed in an update in the near future.\n\nDespite this I like it and I'd recommend it to History nuts and strategy fans.","May 18, 2015","true","16.4"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","1"

I cursed Slitherine for publishing such filler, and shook my head in disgust that they were wasting their time and not spending it remaking Age of Rifles or the Operational Art of War.\n\nI bought some other games in the meantime, but that easy to play, yet satisfying gameplay wargaming itch just wasn't being scratched. After watching a video of this game, it intrgiued me, and I thought it's only £7 so not a biggie if it turns out to be fluff.\n\nAround 8 hours of play later, and I can say that I find this a very satisfying wargaming experience. It's a budget wargame where most of the money has gone into developing absolutely compelling gameplay with mechanics that would be at home in any serious wargame (and it looks nice too). All the bits fit together smoothly, and the game designers must be experience wargamers to have been able to streamline it down to the essentials in the way they have. It all feels conceptually and mechanically very economical, and presents a real wargaming challenge, particularly since the assymetic nature of the conflict enables the AI to provide a compentent insurgent opponent. You are constantly trying to manage your resources to satisfy your needs for intelligence, firepower, territory control, mobility and logisitics, and difficult and shifting tradeoffs of these are continually called for to combat a fluid and elusive enemy.\n","April 12, 2015","true","16.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

Don't be discouraged by how the enemy melts away into the jungle. This is supposed to happen and is part of the rules of the game as an abstraction of the war. If you are confused by what is happening, do read the manual. At first glance, it might seem like there isn't much going on here (i.e. go forth and seek and destroy). But the robust logistics system in the game is really the meat and potatoes. You can't sit back on your laurels either once you get your first foot hold. The political points system forces the player to keep on the offensive even after building a firebase. Veteran is pretty hard, at least for me. I wish there was an intermediate difficulty level between low and high - that is the only critique I have.","April 12, 2015","true","10.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"

The randomly generated terrain adds a great deal in terms of tactics and boy is it tough at times. I got a bit complacent during first game when things seemed to be going well and an unfortunate choice of forward base which led to me getting pummeled by NVA artillery from what turned out to be a nearby base, which was the begining of the end since I spend the rest of the game getting ruthlessly driven backwards across the map. I can't imagine how the AI on Veteran behaves.\n\nWhat I find very interesting about this game is that its not so much about winning gung ho as it is about making every move count towards the bigger picture (45 turns). It's a much about damage limitation at times at it is about winning and the H+M balance being so tight at times doesn't allow you much room to recover if you balls up significantly. Certainly worthwhile getting behind the developers here, it's rare these days to see a game where time has been spent on the right things and not just graphics porn. While not setting the world alight, the graphics here are very likable too in their own way.\n\n65/10","April 27, 2015","true","18.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

The voice over is not annoying and one can actually pump some good 60's blues and rocks on the media player to give it some added mood.\n\nThe game is asymetrical. The sides in conflict work by different means to achieve the same objective. This is a plus on my book.\nThe mechanics are, in my opinion, well designed. The rules are clear - win the hearts of the population by keeping territory "control". Sounds quite complicated and it is because it is not simply a question of moving what where. It is about moving somewhere, half blind and with a supply chain support.\n\nIt provides fun in the long run and some degree of replayability. For the new players the game can be merciless but it has a decently fair learning curve, not steep, not shallow.\n\nInteresting game with excellent fun factor. Simple setup wargame with well designed mechanics.\nNever mind the "random stuff naysayers". It is Vietnam.
