It was never intended to be a serious blood and gore vampire game, It was a satire on the whole vampire thing, and I found that refreshing. It was also corny like a 1950 B movie, which I believe was done intentionally. There is a lot of comedy in the game. I also liked the fact that the achievements were easy to obtain for a change. The game was also short in length which I consider a plus.

I really like hidden object game so that's not the issue. The thing is... This game is poorly made. The story, the voiceacting, and you will encounter tons of bugs e.g.:\n\nWhite boxes everywhere in a hidden object scene\nIn certain hidden object scenes each click will throw you out of the scene, rinse repeat (unless you restart the game)\nYou need to guess where the hidden object scenes even are, how many of a certain item is placed in each one + no indication what is clickable or whether there is an item hidden behind another one or not. In order to complete the scenes, you basicly need to click on everything..\nYou often need to restart the game because of bugs e.g. when the game doesn't register any clicks being made in a scene\nEvery time someone finishes a sentence you need to click to get to the next sentence\nGenerally the story is really poor concerning the dialogue\nThe English subtitles are even different from the spoken English\nThe graphics are not the greatest thing and sometimes the characters are floating above the ground when they obviously shouldn't.\nThe animations in the game are extremely poor. Especially the raven flying away at the castle.\nThe puzzles are really dull\nThe achievements are not unlocking in right order and there is a broken achievement - but they seemed to have fixed it today (20/11-14), so the game might be further improved.\nThe only good thing about the game is the ending. The outtakes are a bit funny. But that's all. And the fact, it's 3~ hours game with possibility to unlock all achievements since they finally fixed it. Though I would still not recommend the game at all.\n","November 20, 2014","false","5.3"," 70 of 90 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","70","90","4","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kzwen/recommended/326180/","kzwen","kzwen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kzwen/","2201 products in account","I have a lot of issues with this game. I am a fan of HOGs (hidden object games) thus it is not the genre that I have a problem with. I believe the devs intended Sinister City to have a B-movie campy feel. In some parts, they succeeded but the storyline ended up feeling jerky - for lack of better term. I can poke a lot of holes at the story but alas, it is not the main problem.\n\nGame issues:\n\n1) In this game, you are simply given items to search, eg. 5 rungs of a ladder, and you have no idea where the HOG scene is. In some games, this is part of the fun. In this game however, the "fun" is marred by the fact that those 5 rungs are spread among various hidden HOG scenes. You have no idea how many rungs this particular scene has.\n\n2) This can actually go hand in hand with pt 1. In usual HOG scenes, there are some items which are doubly hidden. Eg. You are to find a pearl. That pearl could be hidden in a oyster shell. Thus the game will show 'pearl' in your search list in a different color, to let the player know that it is a hidden item. This is the case for ALL the hogs I have played so far and I have played way more HOGs than my fingers and toes could count. Sinister City has NO SUCH THING. Thus you have zero idea if that item you can't find is simply staring at you right in front of your eyes or if it is hidden behind something irrelevant in one of the many HOG scenes.\n\n3) In advanced mode, the game is not supposed to show you your task but on occasions, it shows up and then flickers off. This is likely another bug.\n\n4) The game is pretty much fully voiced. This is supposed to be a good thing but the voice acting in all honesty, is crap. Furthermore, they don't match with the subtitles at all.\n\n5) Despite being a HOG lover, I will be the first to admit that you often do some illogical things in HOGs. However, in this game, it takes the cake. Eg. Your task is to brew a truth potion and get the Count to drink it. What you do actually, is finding all the ingredients and brewing it RIGHT IN FRONT of the Count. After the potion is brewed, you hand it to the Count who actually said something along the lines of, wow, something healthy, give it to me quick. Like...seriously. What.\n\n6) Achievements are bugged. They unlock out of order for almost every achievement. This is not a major issue but as of writing, the achievement for playing in advanced mode doesn't unlock.\n[EDIT: After a whole month later, the devs finally fixed the issue and the advanced achievement is now unlockable.]\n\nI can go on but let's just say this is a do not recommend in my books. Being a HOG, the game can't even handle itself well on the gameplay and you end up randomly clicking items in hopes that one of them hides the item you are looking for. The only saving point is that the devs did not implement any achievement for "have less than xxx misclicks" because that is impossible.\n\nPer pt 1 & 2, if you want examples of HOGs that do them well, try any of Artifex Mundi games or MumboJumbo's Midnight Mysteries.","October 23, 2014","false","2.5"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","43","56","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/326180/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","590 products in account","I've played many hidden object games but have never bothered reviewing any of them, partly because I think everybody generally gets the idea by now and more or less knows what to expect, but also because, with a few exceptions, there's usually so little difference between the content and quality that were I to write reviews for each and every one I'd essentially end up trying to find dozens of different ways to say the exact same thing. (By the by, just about anything published by Artifex Mundi should see you right if you're looking to get into the genre) But I'm writing one for Sinister City as I feel I need to come to its defence a little and share my own take on it.\n\nIt seems like such a cop-out when people say the only reason somebody doesn't like something is because they don't understand it. It's sort of a thinly-veiled way of calling someone stupid rather than accept they might understand it perfectly but just not like it, that they simply have a different preference than you. But after reading a lot of the negative reviews, this is one occasion where I actually feel like some people kinda didn't get it. As pretentious and w*nky as it is to say, there is a difference between something being parody, pastiche and just plain bad, and this game dips its toes into all three, which is where I think a lot of confusion comes from.\n\nLet's get it out of the way and say what needs to be said, many parts of this game are bad, unintentionally so. Graphically it's kind of somewhere between looking like a PS2 and PS3 era game and there were quite a few times in the hidden object sections when I wished everything was clearer or more distinct. In other games in the genre these sections can have a more artistic slant with their high quality renders of interesting scenes and items. Here, everything is far more workmanlike and pretty forgettable; a straight on view of some open cupboards or top down into a box with a small handful of items in it. They don't feel hugely inspired. But worst of all are the bugs and glitches that plague the game. It happened to me a few times where some strange artifacting would appear in the form of white blocks across the screen and completely obscure my view, or every time I'd click anywhere in a hidden object scene it would kick me out of it forcing me to manually enter the scene repeatedly after every object I found. In fairness, this only happened to me in the second stage of the game then never bothered me again after (exiting to the main menu then hitting Continue eventually seemed to fix this for me. In some cases I think Steam pop-ups may have triggered this to happen, but I'm not completely sure). They were the only issues I had personally, but others have complained of far worse, like losing save data every time they closed the game or buggy achievements not registering properly, or in some cases, not even being able to start the game at all. And if anyone had these issues then they'd be absolutely right to give it a bad review as their experience with the title. But, thankfully, I had a far better time with it. Well... eventually.\n\n[View Comments for the missing 4th paragraph]\n\nYou play as a sort of Tom Cruise lookalike trying to find his kidnapped fiancé and being lead to Sinister City in the search. A kindly old hotel receptionist tells him to stay away from there, that it's a vampire city, and the guy doesn't even bat an eyelid at the mention of vampires. Nor does he when he's invited to a session of telepathic communication to try tracking her down, he just accepts the offer and follows an old man into a darkened back room. I think pretty much everyone who plays it either laughs their *ss off at these points or else says it's stupid and loses all hope for the game, I know they were certainly my reactions. But then I got to a point where it just sort of clicked with me. I realised they understood these games are dumb and their stories make no sense, so they start having a little fun and going all out ridiculous with it. The head vampire kidnaps his own daughter to arrange for her to marry a kid's TV presenter to vicariously live out his own failed ambitions of movie stardom that he's secretly harboured for centuries. Oscar Wilde, this is not. But I love that they have fun with it rather than being so serious like most of the other games and I was surprised at how much I laughed at some genuinely funny moments in it. If you have to make a crazy, nonsense story, I think it's way better to go funny with it instead of trying to be respectable with how legit you are with your craft, and I applaud them for making that move here.\n\nLike I said, if anyone had a bad experience with this on a technical level then I can't argue with that, and to begin with I was right there with them. But by the end this game thoroughly won me over and I had a great couple of hours with it. With some funny moments, some interesting hidden object play that I eventually came around to, and at least an attempt at a new variety of mini games for the genre, I can easily say this was the best 9 cents I've ever spent.","November 7, 2015","true","2.3"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","15","15","2","3"

In other words, she'll be wed to a vampire the next morning. Your only way is  to convince him that you're the one for her...\n\nSinister City has probably one of the worst plots in HO games if you take that seriously. In reality, the plot is a great parody of horror stories as the father wants to be an actor, the mother is a powerful businesswoman and that every vampire met is friendly.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as other games of the genre: list of items, objects to find and to use, puzzles to solve. Everything is quite easy. However, there is a game-breaking bug at the beginning and the only way to get past it is to exit the game and relaunch it. If you don't know that, you may be frustrated to be stopped so early in the story and that you can't do anything about it. Once past that, you can enjoy the game that isn't so bad as you could fear.\n\nThe graphics are correct, even if the vampires aren't really terrifying as they should but as it's a parody, it's normal to have them behaving comically. The soundtrack is correct too.\n\nI played the game more than a year ago and I suppose that you can feel that with my review. But I remember clearly that I said to people: Once you get past the famous bug and if you can handle a silly plot, you'll enjoy the game.  So, while Sinister City isn't the greatest game out there, it's still a good moment to pass. Other titles from JetDog are better (Frankenstein: Master of Death is the best example) but well, Sinister City will not make a hole in your wallet and will not hurt you.","February 27","true","2.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It's not even funny bad, it is depressingly bad. Worse even...\n\n2) you can't escape the story.

But that is the only thing good it has to offer.  If you are looking for a dark and scary story, forget about it,  there is nothing scary about this game.\nThe story evolves around a silly plot that goes like this: Your girlfriend was hidden from you by his father who turns out to be a vampire lord.  Your future father-in-law is basically against your relationship because you are just a mere mortal.  Because you are more interested in the undead than the living, you still went out and searched for your bloodsucking girlfriend.\nYou do this and that. Then followed by you look for this and that.  And a little more of you fetch this and that.  Then towards the end the story takes an odd turn which was absolutely ridiculous.  I don't want to spoil the ending for you, but believe me it was rather silly.\nThe puzzles are rather easy and the only challenge is when you are trying to locate objects that were microscopic and finding things that blend with their backgrounds, other than that it was smooth sailing for me.\nIn conclusion, I would NOT recommend this game,  I like the artwork and the graphics but I just could not stand the horrible plot.  As they say " Don't judge a book by its cover" or in my case the "Title".  If you are looking of a challenging game, I suggest you find it elsewhere.","April 10, 2015","false","10.2"," 26 of 45 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","26","45","0","5"

Since the otaku fan boy is having a mid-life crisis (at 500 years old), he is causing grief for his daughter and her fiance, who has come to find her.\n\nFor the amusement value alone this game is worth the playthrough (and the price of 99 cents).  How serious can the storyline (or the characters, for that matter) really be when the News Station is called "Plan 9"?\n\nTrivia 1: Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) starring Bela Lugosi directed by Ed Wood is considered to be the worst creature feature ever made.\nTrivia 2:  Bela Lugosi's protrayal of Dracula (1931) in some circles is still considered one of the best.\nTrivia 3: The 1922 back and white German silent film 'Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror' is considered to be a cinematic influential masterpiece, and even by today's standards is still considered to be one of the best Dracula movies ever made.  (Dracula's name in the film was changed to Count Orlock.)\nTrivia 4: Jonathan Harker and "Mina" Murray were the bethrothed and eventually married "lovers" in Bram Stroker's 'Dracula'.\n\nGameplay is twitchy and glitchy (if stuck just exit the game then hit continue when coming back).  There are no  instructions for any puzzles, so previous puzzle experience and a bit of intuition is needed.  (I got stuck once and had to look up the solution, which is randomized I discovered on a different playthrough.)  Plenty of HO scenes to do, and not the usual type of getting an object at the end.  I sorta wondered the entire time why the HOs scenes were even there but they do serve a purpose.  In some ways this game feels like an experiment in third person play by Jet Dogs Studios and reminscent of how Syberia and Niburu plays, without defined instructions on what to do or where to look.\n\nWorth a look and at least one playthrough just for the campy cheesiness of it.  (This would be perfect fodder for MSTies  (Mystery Science Theatre 3000)).","September 3, 2015","true","9.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","2"

The game itself is very straightforward and you can't get stuck on a puzzle if you wanted to, thanks to the unlimited hints system.\nThe puzzles are not at all difficult and won't be a problem to anyone, while the hidden object screens will occasionally annoy you with the low res graphics, but still won't be much of a problem.\n\nThe story is not trying to be serious at all, it almost felt like a parody in a way. The bad guy is a vampire that is apparently the one responsible for your finacee's disappearance, and you will have a chance to talk with him as the time goes on. The game is quite short, took  me less than 2 hours to finish.\n\nI did encounter some bugs while playing, like sometimes the graphics of a certain objects will disappear, or while in the hidden object scene, every click of the mouse will exit the screen until you go back to the main menu and reenter the game from there.\n\nVoice acting was ok, I've heard better, but it's tolerable. All in all, if you like hidden object games you are probably gonna like this one too. If you have never played a HO game, you probably want to try a better game to see if you'll like the genre.\n\n+ decent voice acting\n+ mostly bug-free\n+ cheap\n\n- quite short\n- not  very innovative\n- some low res graphics\n- a few bugs\n\nIf you like the genre, go ahead and buy it (it's really cheap), and if not you might wanna skip this one, although with this price tag, you can't go too wrong.     6/10","December 30, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You will spend the entire hour or so of this game in constant fear and...Whoops!\n\nGot my intros mixed up.\n\nYour fiance has been kidnapped by a vampire! Are you a bad enough dud to rescue your fiance?! Action and adventure await in Sinister City!\n\nHmm..Nope...That one kinda sucks too.\n\nTruth is, there's not much to discuss when it comes to Sinister City. Not too long ago, this game was on sale for around 10 cents. On top of that, it has cards, so you're all but guaranteed to profit off of the purchase. Therefore, I'm going to assume that you already own this game, and are just reading this review because you assume there will be some funny jokes.\n\n\nYou know what they say about assumptions right?\n\nIn the interest of being "helpful" I'll talk about the actual game. Sinister City is a hidden-object puzzler. Look for the object, find the object, click on the object, become a winner. I must warn you though, the objects tend to be hidden. Occasionally there are puzzles to break up the monotony, but nothing too strenuous. For those exceedingly rare situations that you're actually stuck, a handy "HELP!" button is always nearby.\n\nNot all hidden-object games are equal, and Sinister City is IMO an example of a mediocre one. The images are of a lower resolution, which makes objects muddy and difficult to spot. Yeah I know, it sounds ironic when you think about it, but bear with me on this. Another unfortunate technical issue is the prevalence of bugs. These can range from disappearing images to the game no longer properly responding to your inputs. Thankfully, these are usually cleared up by quitting to the main menu. The game saves automatically and constantly, so all you have to fear is those wacky vampires, not the possibility of losing progress.\n\nThe following couple paragraphs include SPOILERS!\n\n\n----SPOILERS----\n\nThis next aspect is not so much a complaint about Sinister City, but about adventure games in general. All too often they rely on this logic that is baffling to normal human behavior. At one point in this game you have to find some books so that somebody will talk to you. There is an abandoned bookstand nearby, but the protagonist doesn't want to steal the books. In order to pay for these $20 books, he finds 75 cents in loose change scattered on the ground. If that made too much sense, consider that the protagonist steals a key from the bookstore to open a mailbox.\n\nSinister City's attempts at humor are also...pretty laughable. Early on the protagonist acquires some vampire hunting equipment. He's getting geared up to kill a vampire, but then some guy points out that not everything is as it seems. The protagonist takes a closer look at a stake he picked up, and he finds the words "MADE IN CHINA" engraved on it. The "Made in China" gag is as old as time, but it doesn't work when written on a stake. A stake is a piece of wood sharpened to a point. It's possible that the Chinese stake is actually made of soft rubber, but wouldn't the protag notice that? Here's a thought: Crosses are also commonly used to fight vampires. So how about having the Cross say "MADE IN CHINA". Eh? Eh? Okay whatever. The point is this, when you're trying to make a gag out of something that's almost impossible to screw up, it doesn't really work. Yes, I have a nasty habit of nitpicking. What can I say? I love talking about mistakes.\n\n----END OF SPOILERS! YOU CAN BREATHE EASY NOW.----\n\n\nEven with its faults, Sinister City is still an enjoyable romp. It doesn't take itself seriously at all, the voice-acting is amazing, and the game ends before you get tired of it. I'm not usually one to recommend bad games - even the ones that are "purposefully" bad - simply because they take too long to complete. This game delivers on hidden objects and puzzles, which is always nice to have when you're not in the mood for more Counterstrike or DOTA2 or Sakura Angels. It's nothing difficult, but at least it'll give you something to do if you have an hour or so to burn.","August 30, 2015","true","5.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Well...maybe it's a bit harsh of me for saying it. Either way the game itself can't be taken seriously.\n\nGame Visual/Audio\nThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're okay. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGameplay\nThere are two different game difficulty modes to choose from:  Easy and Advanced.\n\nThere are seventeen different achievements to be earned from the game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements that needs to be completed before they can be obtained.\n\nThere's no inventory panel that's visible. It only shows when an item is collected.\n\nMost of the hidden object scenes consists of traditional word lists, find "x" amount of an item.  Some of them do require little or no interaction. Please note that later part of the game, you'll have to keep entering the hidden object scene, after each item is found. Maybe it's glitch/bug in the game that the developer of the game didn't bother to fix.\n\nThe puzzle, at least the first one, it's rather simple to solve.\n\nThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nBottom line, the game itself, doesn't has the quality of replayability. Nor, it's rememberable.  On top of it, it has some glitches/bug, making the game hard to complete. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.\n\nEdit (9/28/2015): Reinstalling the game did fixed some of the graphical and exiting hidden object scene glitch that I was having before.

Hidden objects scenes are challenging, indeed some objects can only be found after interacting with the scene by combining one or several items or solving a medium puzzle. The only bad point is that you need to click everywhere to find an Hidden Object Scene. Also you'll have to find several items through your quest in these Hidden Object Scenes.\n\n(*):\nSome achievements required you to not skip any mini-game, hidden objects scene or cutscene.

I really like hidden object game so that's not the issue. The thing is... This game is poorly made. The story, the voiceacting, and you will encounter tons of bugs e.g.:\n\nWhite boxes everywhere in a hidden object scene\nIn certain hidden object scenes each click will throw you out of the scene, rinse repeat (unless you restart the game)\nYou need to guess where the hidden object scenes even are, how many of a certain item is placed in each one + no indication what is clickable or whether there is an item hidden behind another one or not. In order to complete the scenes, you basicly need to click on everything..\nYou often need to restart the game because of bugs e.g. when the game doesn't register any clicks being made in a scene\nEvery time someone finishes a sentence you need to click to get to the next sentence\nGenerally the story is really poor concerning the dialogue\nThe English subtitles are even different from the spoken English\nThe graphics are not the greatest thing and sometimes the characters are floating above the ground when they obviously shouldn't.\nThe animations in the game are extremely poor. Especially the raven flying away at the castle.\nThe puzzles are really dull\nThe achievements are not unlocking in right order and there is a broken achievement - but they seemed to have fixed it today (20/11-14), so the game might be further improved.\nThe only good thing about the game is the ending. The outtakes are a bit funny. But that's all. And the fact, it's 3~ hours game with possibility to unlock all achievements since they finally fixed it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kzwen/recommended/326180/","kzwen","kzwen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kzwen/","2201 products in account","I have a lot of issues with this game. I am a fan of HOGs (hidden object games) thus it is not the genre that I have a problem with. I believe the devs intended Sinister City to have a B-movie campy feel. In some parts, they succeeded but the storyline ended up feeling jerky - for lack of better term. I can poke a lot of holes at the story but alas, it is not the main problem.\n\nGame issues:\n\n1) In this game, you are simply given items to search, eg. 5 rungs of a ladder, and you have no idea where the HOG scene is. In some games, this is part of the fun. In this game however, the "fun" is marred by the fact that those 5 rungs are spread among various hidden HOG scenes. You have no idea how many rungs this particular scene has.\n\n2) This can actually go hand in hand with pt 1. In usual HOG scenes, there are some items which are doubly hidden. Eg. You are to find a pearl. That pearl could be hidden in a oyster shell. Thus the game will show 'pearl' in your search list in a different color, to let the player know that it is a hidden item. This is the case for ALL the hogs I have played so far and I have played way more HOGs than my fingers and toes could count. Sinister City has NO SUCH THING. Thus you have zero idea if that item you can't find is simply staring at you right in front of your eyes or if it is hidden behind something irrelevant in one of the many HOG scenes.\n\n3) In advanced mode, the game is not supposed to show you your task but on occasions, it shows up and then flickers off. This is likely another bug.\n\n4) The game is pretty much fully voiced. This is supposed to be a good thing but the voice acting in all honesty, is crap. Furthermore, they don't match with the subtitles at all.\n\n5) Despite being a HOG lover, I will be the first to admit that you often do some illogical things in HOGs. However, in this game, it takes the cake. Eg. Your task is to brew a truth potion and get the Count to drink it. What you do actually, is finding all the ingredients and brewing it RIGHT IN FRONT of the Count. After the potion is brewed, you hand it to the Count who actually said something along the lines of, wow, something healthy, give it to me quick. Like...seriously. What.\n\n6) Achievements are bugged. They unlock out of order for almost every achievement. This is not a major issue but as of writing, the achievement for playing in advanced mode doesn't unlock.\n[EDIT: After a whole month later, the devs finally fixed the issue and the advanced achievement is now unlockable.]\n\nI can go on but let's just say this is a do not recommend in my books. Being a HOG, the game can't even handle itself well on the gameplay and you end up randomly clicking items in hopes that one of them hides the item you are looking for. The only saving point is that the devs did not implement any achievement for "have less than xxx misclicks" because that is impossible.\n\nPer pt 1 & 2, if you want examples of HOGs that do them well, try any of Artifex Mundi games or MumboJumbo's Midnight Mysteries.","October 23, 2014","false","2.5"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","43","56","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/326180/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","590 products in account","I've played many hidden object games but have never bothered reviewing any of them, partly because I think everybody generally gets the idea by now and more or less knows what to expect, but also because, with a few exceptions, there's usually so little difference between the content and quality that were I to write reviews for each and every one I'd essentially end up trying to find dozens of different ways to say the exact same thing. (By the by, just about anything published by Artifex Mundi should see you right if you're looking to get into the genre) But I'm writing one for Sinister City as I feel I need to come to its defence a little and share my own take on it.\n\nIt seems like such a cop-out when people say the only reason somebody doesn't like something is because they don't understand it. It's sort of a thinly-veiled way of calling someone stupid rather than accept they might understand it perfectly but just not like it, that they simply have a different preference than you. But after reading a lot of the negative reviews, this is one occasion where I actually feel like some people kinda didn't get it. As pretentious and w*nky as it is to say, there is a difference between something being parody, pastiche and just plain bad, and this game dips its toes into all three, which is where I think a lot of confusion comes from.\n\nLet's get it out of the way and say what needs to be said, many parts of this game are bad, unintentionally so. Graphically it's kind of somewhere between looking like a PS2 and PS3 era game and there were quite a few times in the hidden object sections when I wished everything was clearer or more distinct. In other games in the genre these sections can have a more artistic slant with their high quality renders of interesting scenes and items. Here, everything is far more workmanlike and pretty forgettable; a straight on view of some open cupboards or top down into a box with a small handful of items in it. They don't feel hugely inspired. But worst of all are the bugs and glitches that plague the game. It happened to me a few times where some strange artifacting would appear in the form of white blocks across the screen and completely obscure my view, or every time I'd click anywhere in a hidden object scene it would kick me out of it forcing me to manually enter the scene repeatedly after every object I found. In fairness, this only happened to me in the second stage of the game then never bothered me again after (exiting to the main menu then hitting Continue eventually seemed to fix this for me. In some cases I think Steam pop-ups may have triggered this to happen, but I'm not completely sure). They were the only issues I had personally, but others have complained of far worse, like losing save data every time they closed the game or buggy achievements not registering properly, or in some cases, not even being able to start the game at all. And if anyone had these issues then they'd be absolutely right to give it a bad review as their experience with the title. But, thankfully, I had a far better time with it. Well... eventually.\n\n[View Comments for the missing 4th paragraph]\n\nYou play as a sort of Tom Cruise lookalike trying to find his kidnapped fiancé and being lead to Sinister City in the search. A kindly old hotel receptionist tells him to stay away from there, that it's a vampire city, and the guy doesn't even bat an eyelid at the mention of vampires. Nor does he when he's invited to a session of telepathic communication to try tracking her down, he just accepts the offer and follows an old man into a darkened back room. I think pretty much everyone who plays it either laughs their *ss off at these points or else says it's stupid and loses all hope for the game, I know they were certainly my reactions. But then I got to a point where it just sort of clicked with me. I realised they understood these games are dumb and their stories make no sense, so they start having a little fun and going all out ridiculous with it. The head vampire kidnaps his own daughter to arrange for her to marry a kid's TV presenter to vicariously live out his own failed ambitions of movie stardom that he's secretly harboured for centuries. Oscar Wilde, this is not. But I love that they have fun with it rather than being so serious like most of the other games and I was surprised at how much I laughed at some genuinely funny moments in it. If you have to make a crazy, nonsense story, I think it's way better to go funny with it instead of trying to be respectable with how legit you are with your craft, and I applaud them for making that move here.\n\nLike I said, if anyone had a bad experience with this on a technical level then I can't argue with that, and to begin with I was right there with them. But by the end this game thoroughly won me over and I had a great couple of hours with it. With some funny moments, some interesting hidden object play that I eventually came around to, and at least an attempt at a new variety of mini games for the genre, I can easily say this was the best 9 cents I've ever spent.","November 7, 2015","true","2.3"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","15","15","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/recommended/326180/","espresso651","Espresso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/","281 products in account","In Sum: Playable but not great hidden object game with some glaring flaws. Do not buy at full price.  3/5\n\nThis is another grudgingly recommended game, which I would have preferred a neutral rating on.  This is not a horrible game, and I have suffered a share of stinkers on Steam.  It is just a hidden object game, not much more or less than that, and I suspect a lot of the objection here is due to the casual nature of the game.  However even as a genre, within hidden object games, there is something to be desired.\n\nThe concept is seemingly inspired by Dracula and early vampire movies that novel inspired, but with a twist that comes off somewhat amusing but not pulled off as well as, say, a similar theme in Magicka.  Unlike most hidden object games, you actually get to play a character and move around some parts of the game.  The visuals are actually decent for the non-searching parts of the game, and the voice acting is not bad.  It feels like it would have been a well-received, even high quality game in 1998.  I am not saying that the graphics are that ancient, just that I can't help but recall the casual  games of that era.\n\nThe game consists of exploring very small areas for hidden objects, talking to NPCs, and solving puzzles.  Through playing, you effectively unlock search quests where you must find a certain number of specified items.  In some areas, there are item lists that must also be found before a quest item is revealed.  Once the quest is completed, a puzzle must be solved.  The puzzles are not complicated in the least.\n\nSome HO games are difficult for various reasons, including devious trickery in design, such as putting similar looking objects, wordplay in clues, shifting images, interactive objects, and so on.  This game uses it's own method of frustrating the player, and it unfortunately is not very satisfying.  The objects are often hidden behind other objects that are not related to the puzzle (like a book or a plate), which must be clicked on to reveal the item underneath.  Makes it hard to search for something that isn't there.  Worst of all, the lighting and visibility of the objects is often terrible, to the point where I found myself clicking the screen randomly...and still succeeding!  Despite screen settings, the images can be so dim that they are practially not there, and I am sure on some monitors, would not show up at all.  And with the secret movable items and the poor display of items, and a lack of consequence for random clicking, it can become as much of a clicking game as Cookie Clicker...but without managers.\n\nSome seem to say that the objects are hard to find because they are not what people are expecting.  I have played many hidden object games, and as far as the genre goes, this one is actually very good at properly telling you what you are looking for.\n\nThere are two major glitches, however.  If you are using Windows 7 or above, you will need to set the game to XP compatibility mode, or it won't even launch.  Sometimes during the game, you will not be able to interact with environments after a cutscene.  Going to the main menu then resuming will fix this.\n\nAll together, it is an acceptable HO game, purely casual and good for destressing or a waste of time.  On the easiest mode, there is no pressure and no consequence for wrong, and the soundtrack is not bad at all.  It was worth the 9 cents, but not the $10 full price by any means.","August 24, 2015","true","4.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The game is simple, the graphics are basic and the sound/voice acting are mediocre compared to others of the same genre that I've played.  I hit a couple graphical bugs where the screen had white boxes covering up part of the hidden object scene.  I also had a bug where after finding an object in the hidden object scene it kicked me out of the scene and back to the main game.  This made it very tedious and frustrating, when casual gaming should not bring up these types of situations and emotions.  The goal is save your girlfriend from a vampire in Sinister City.  The game would be easily recommended even with its below par graphics and sound if the bugs were fixed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ganondork/recommended/326180/","ganondork","Ganondork","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ganondork/","159 products in account","This game is a perfect example of why I wish Steam had a "Meh." option, instead of just yes or no to a recommendation.\n\nI have played several point-and-click, hidden object games at this point, and there are definitely some things that Sinister City does that I appreciate, albeit not well enough to not be a bit, frankly, dumb.\n\nHere's the break-down for me, + signs being positives and - being negatives.\n+Incorporation of 3-dimensional character models. While most games of this type simply present you with a two-dimensional scene, in this you do actually have to move the protagonist, John, around in a space.\n- However, on that same note, the areas where you can move are more or less two-dimensional and not all of them seem to have been designed with a character walking around them in mind. This results in some frankly hilarious looking scenes, like John and the TV Station security guard just hovering above the ground in front of the TV station, as if they were part of the door and not actual characters.\n+ Voice Acting - for a casual game of this type, it's actually really good.\n- Except for John's voice. And he's the main character. So he talks all the time. (Ipkis is pretty bad too but you only have to talk to him a couple times)\n- The background music isn't bad, but it is extremely repetitive.\n- Game is short, even for a HOP game.\n+ Price. Guys for real, it's a dollar. Even if you end up despising it, are you really gonna cry over that dollar?\n+ Story...it's satirical of your typical spooky vampire motif, which is actually genuinely amusing at times. Not funny, but amusing. Worthy of a slight smirk. Also, John and Nina's lovey-dovey-ness is so over the top that it becomes a humorous exaggeration of dime-a-dozen love stories. Whether or not this was intentional is debatable, but seeing it as satire makes it more bearable.\n- Story ... buuuuutttt a lot of it feels rushed and nonsensical, even for a game about a town full of vampires (who completely openly exist and no one really questions it....?). Spoiler free example: When your character finds out his fiancee is being held in a town full of vampires, he at no point stops and says, "Woah, man. Slow your roll. VAMPIRES? Vampires are real?" He's basically Anakin Skywalker in Episode 3 of Star Wars, but without the death, ("Oh my god, what have I done? Waaaahhhhhhh"  ... "So you wanna join the Dark Side?" ... "Yeah, okay.") He just immediately accepts something that you would think would be a hell of a revelation for your average human dude who just wants to get married.\n- Saw the last bit of the ending coming a mile away.\n+ All the characters actually have a unique design and personalities, however minimal those personalities may be.\n+ Several objects in the HOPs were genuinely difficult to find, which I like.\n- But all the other minigames were horrendously easy.\n\nAll in all, it really is a "meh" kind of thing for me. I didn't like it, but I didn't dislike it. Had it been fleshed out more into a bigger and longer story, and more time taken on animation, it could have been really good. The developers definitely have some skill; it's just in need of serious refinement.\nI labeled it as recommended in the end because of the price. It's only a buck, and there are definitely worse things to do when you're bored, and worse games that I've played for more money--on sale.","November 6, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here we go.\n\nI knew from the Jet Dog Studios intro that this was, in fact, something I would enjoy.\n\nThe voices do not match up to mouth animations. I was not deterred.\n\nFirst time leading man talks, his spoken lines do not match up to what is written in the text box.\n\nClassic wheelin' and dealin' from receptionist. Thumbs up.\n\nFirst creepy scene. You know what I mean(no spoilers). Was actually pretty good. Thumbs up. Short and sweet.\n\nIn my youth, I loved Where's Waldo and the knock-offs, but I-Spy wasn't my thing, so the gameplay is knocked down a little due to a bias against. Although, the way the puzzles are introduced is well done.\n\n\n-Glitch Report #1: After being locked in Astral Plane and told to search for mirror pieces, the game would not let me click on anything except to walk around. Had to return to main menu and continue. This fixed the issue.\n\n-Glitch Report #2: When I reloaded to fix glitch #1, while I can click to search areas, when i click to check or pick up an item, it brings back to the walking section. Everytime. This makes searching very tedious.\n\n-Glitch Report #3: I reloaded, but #2 prevailed. So I continue, despite frustration. This lead to accessing a puzzle and half the items are whited out. Impossible to search for everything. Correction: I found everything very easily as they were about half of what was actually visible. Nice.... for a while. Until the items are in the white areas. Eventually have to keep using hints to show me where they are, so I can click them. Now I have to repair the mirror and half the screen is white.\n\n-Glitch Report #4: I have one piece left. everytime i try to put it in place, it askes me "Are you sure you want to skip puzzle?" I keep saying no.\n\nGlitches subside. Will let me take garlic and knives to a fight, but not the guns. I even had to find a bullet in a puzzle. I have at least one. Let me take the gun. Thumbs down.\n\nOrlock didn't notice I was preparing a truth potion right in his fire? Got to Tv Station. I'm kinda bored, and was gifted two wishlist games. I'll go there for now.\n\nRecommend: For ISpy fans, yes. Umm....4/5 for what it is. A find-the-item-puzzle game with a few walking sequences between puzzles and a very cheesy "hollywood" vampire love story.

Even adding a maybe button would be enough.  Now that that's been said, this game.\n\nSinister City is a point-and-click hidden-object game, in the vein of the Mystery Case Files series.  For only being 99 cents, it isn't the worst game in the genre.  It doesn't stack up to the aforementioned MCF series, but for what it's worth, you could do much worse.\n\nYou play as a human guy whose bride-to-be is a vampire.  Her father doesn't want her marrying a non-vampire (for hopefully obvious reasons), so he LOCKS HER IN A CAGE.  To free her, you need to complete a series of puzzles that aren't hard at all.  I played through the game in full, and only clocked in about 2 hours.\n\nI have to give credit to Jetdogs Studios for getting some decent voice talent in this game.  Whether or not I recommend this game to you is dependent on whether or not it looks interesting to you.  If so, then yes, and vice versa.  This game gets my Seal of Approval.  Just, don't play for the plot.  And if you do, keep a state-of-mind altering substance of your choice at the ready.","January 24","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a few bugs and the gameplay isn't flawless. You never know if you found everything in a HO scene, because there isn't even an indicator wether you can find anything there or not, which means that wild clicking is the easiest and fastest way to finish it. There is no penalty for it even on advanced, The puzzles are so easy, that they are just there for making the game a little bit longer. If they are not too easy, then they are annoying. Sometimes you have no idea where to go or what to do.\n\nBUT! The story and how everything is told is so hillarious, that it compensates everything! It makes jokes about vampires, adventure games, hollywood and all the classic cliches about lovestories and movies in general. Sure, it has a hard start and you will probably need a little bit time to get in, but after that, it is really nice to watch the characters. Wish, that i could say the same for the actual gameplay, which is only "acceptable".\n\nSo if you are a hard boiled fan of HO games and horror-commedy, then you can have fun with it.","November 15, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Only fixable by restarting the game.\n- No fast travel, This shouldn't really be a complaint but when both of their other games have it and this one doesn't with even more back tracking it really needed it.\n- Normal hints on the puzzle are fine but this game really doesn't tell you where you need to go most of the time where the other two did via their fast travel system.\n\nOverall Score: 6/10 I was pretty harsh on this game, it was the first hidden object game I played by Jetdogs Studios and the least enjoyable. It's still a playable game and has a good amount of hidden object gameplay to it but it's just not quite the same quality as their other products. I would be giving it a 5 instead of a 6 due to the bug i encountered twice but I didn't see anyone else complaining about the same bug, Additionally the free soundtrack is a nice touch.\n\nIn the end if you need a hidden object game there are better to play and worse to play, If you enjoy games by Jetdogs by all means get this you can tell it's one of their games. But if you haven't played one by them play their other ones first, Save this one for later so you don't put yourself off of the experiances their games can provide.","September 25, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is visually appealing as far as character design graphics, but it has standard bland backgrounds and props. The puzzles are 99% typical hidden item interactions and mini-games, with only one that stood out as unique. The click and touch recognitions are wonky in spots, but a majority operational.  The audio and dialogue are bland at best. Support for the game is untested, as it was unneeded. I was able to complete the game on both easy and advanced in a total of about 4 hrs of gameplay. It has very little replay value beyond its second playthrough.\n\nIn short, on my 10-point scale of rating games based on Concept, Appearance, Content & Replay Value, Mechanics, and Sound I would have to give Sinister City a 5/10. This is an overall decent game, but has very little replay value, is short in content, and contains minor flaws.\n\nIn the end, I would recommend this game only if it is on sale for the cheap, as in less than 50 cents, so you can make almost half your money back. Its an ok game, but doesn't have enough to it that would make it worth full price.","August 26, 2015","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Some minor bugs and annoying mechanics are out-weighed by the exceedingly low price and the genuinely fun story and dialogue. If you enjoy the genre and you enjoy a good B-movie story, you should have a reasonably good time for a low price.\n\nReviewYou play as John, a generic American guy looking for his missing bride who apparently got kidnapped by her vampire father. You chase her to the titular Sinister City, the haven of all that is unholy. If that sounds rather silly, don’t worry, that’s the point. Not at any point are you supposed to be taking the game’s story seriously. That, combined with competent voice actors and well-written silly dialogue, provided a good amount of fun for me. Luckily the game does not last long enough (I finished it on advanced mode with all achievements in apparently 2.6 hours according to steam) or use the silliness too ham-fistedly for it to grow stale. I especially liked how they incorporated the silly story with the already silly “go find X items” or “go fix my Z” missions that are the staple of hidden object games. It made it amusing instead of just silly.\n\nThe mechanics of the game were not the best admittedly. The hidden objects and mini-games were decidedly average for the genre coupled with an annoying tendency to have items hidden by other items with no indication that you can interact with the covering item. For example you are in a bookshop looking for item X. Item X is hidden behind a book… you need to click the right book to show it, but your cursor will not change as you hover over it. So basically you need to click all the books in the scene to show it. Sometimes it is more obvious which item is the covering one, but quite frequently you need to click a huge number of random items to find the right one. Which is not great design. However, there are no penalties for misclicks and there is a robust hint-system so when you get used to it, it’s not a huge deal (using the hint-system will costs you an achievement though if you care about that).\n\nThough old areas remain open as you open new ones, the items you need to find is always in the new areas or the game makes it obvious that you need to return to an old area (like, a character tells you to go back to the castle) so there is no annoying backtracking.\n\nPeople have reported a lot of bugs it seems. I only ran into one in one area and it was partially fixed by exiting to the main menu and totally fixed by restarting the game.\n\nOverall, I had a good time with Sinister City. I enjoyed the silly dialogue and story. The mechanics were nothing exciting, but I quite enjoy the genre so that was fine. For the price (I got it for 0.99 euro) I would definitely say it is worth it.","August 20, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

In other words, she'll be wed to a vampire the next morning. Your only way is  to convince him that you're the one for her...\n\nSinister City has probably one of the worst plots in HO games if you take that seriously. In reality, the plot is a great parody of horror stories as the father wants to be an actor, the mother is a powerful businesswoman and that every vampire met is friendly.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as other games of the genre: list of items, objects to find and to use, puzzles to solve. Everything is quite easy. However, there is a game-breaking bug at the beginning and the only way to get past it is to exit the game and relaunch it. If you don't know that, you may be frustrated to be stopped so early in the story and that you can't do anything about it. Once past that, you can enjoy the game that isn't so bad as you could fear.\n\nThe graphics are correct, even if the vampires aren't really terrifying as they should but as it's a parody, it's normal to have them behaving comically. The soundtrack is correct too.\n\nI played the game more than a year ago and I suppose that you can feel that with my review. But I remember clearly that I said to people: Once you get past the famous bug and if you can handle a silly plot, you'll enjoy the game.  So, while Sinister City isn't the greatest game out there, it's still a good moment to pass. Other titles from JetDog are better (Frankenstein: Master of Death is the best example) but well, Sinister City will not make a hole in your wallet and will not hurt you.","February 27","true","2.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It's not even funny bad, it is depressingly bad. Worse even...\n\n2) you can't escape the story.

(!) *The voiceacting is so unbearably bad I muted it. *The list of bugs and glitches is endless.\n\nWhich brought us to what I loved most about this game: I got a game-breaking bug. :D So I can now in good conscience remove this game from my backlog, toss it in the garbage can, and never think of it ever again.\n","December 14, 2014","false","1.4"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","18","26","0","0"

The game also was very buggy, in one scene the hidden object area kept kicking me out of the area everytime I clicked on something and certain places had graphic glitches.

You've come to Sinister City because your fiance has been kidnapped. Sinister City is where vampires live... or something? It's hardly explained, but apparently vampires and other supernatural monsters are not just fully accepted in this world but also big business.\n\nI get what they're going for, a comical deconstruction of vampire tropes strung together with hidden object sequences, but the jokes tend to fall flat. What's worse, far worse, is that there are several glaring bugs in this less-than-two-hour game. Just after the main villain got revealed (your fiance's father objecting to your marriage) I got stuck and only after exiting back out to the menu and returning did it allow me to progress. Later on, at the big finale (...or what passes for it anyway) every click in a hidden object scene not only clicked something but also exited the scene. It was still possible to progress, but it was frustratingly tedious to automatically exit and then manually re-enter each scene after every single click. The icing on the cake is that the very last sequence even had its background bugging out, just showing the clickable items on a white background. Comical deconstruction indeed.\n\nWith the Artifex Mundi games also available on Steam there is no reason at all to pick this up.","June 3, 2015","false","2.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

But that is the only thing good it has to offer.  If you are looking for a dark and scary story, forget about it,  there is nothing scary about this game.\nThe story evolves around a silly plot that goes like this: Your girlfriend was hidden from you by his father who turns out to be a vampire lord.  Your future father-in-law is basically against your relationship because you are just a mere mortal.  Because you are more interested in the undead than the living, you still went out and searched for your bloodsucking girlfriend.\nYou do this and that. Then followed by you look for this and that.  And a little more of you fetch this and that.  Then towards the end the story takes an odd turn which was absolutely ridiculous.  I don't want to spoil the ending for you, but believe me it was rather silly.\nThe puzzles are rather easy and the only challenge is when you are trying to locate objects that were microscopic and finding things that blend with their backgrounds, other than that it was smooth sailing for me.\nIn conclusion, I would NOT recommend this game,  I like the artwork and the graphics but I just could not stand the horrible plot.  As they say " Don't judge a book by its cover" or in my case the "Title".  If you are looking of a challenging game, I suggest you find it elsewhere.","April 10, 2015","false","10.2"," 26 of 45 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","26","45","0","5"

Since the otaku fan boy is having a mid-life crisis (at 500 years old), he is causing grief for his daughter and her fiance, who has come to find her.\n\nFor the amusement value alone this game is worth the playthrough (and the price of 99 cents).  How serious can the storyline (or the characters, for that matter) really be when the News Station is called "Plan 9"?\n\nTrivia 1: Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) starring Bela Lugosi directed by Ed Wood is considered to be the worst creature feature ever made.\nTrivia 2:  Bela Lugosi's protrayal of Dracula (1931) in some circles is still considered one of the best.\nTrivia 3: The 1922 back and white German silent film 'Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror' is considered to be a cinematic influential masterpiece, and even by today's standards is still considered to be one of the best Dracula movies ever made.  (Dracula's name in the film was changed to Count Orlock.)\nTrivia 4: Jonathan Harker and "Mina" Murray were the bethrothed and eventually married "lovers" in Bram Stroker's 'Dracula'.\n\nGameplay is twitchy and glitchy (if stuck just exit the game then hit continue when coming back).  There are no  instructions for any puzzles, so previous puzzle experience and a bit of intuition is needed.  (I got stuck once and had to look up the solution, which is randomized I discovered on a different playthrough.)  Plenty of HO scenes to do, and not the usual type of getting an object at the end.  I sorta wondered the entire time why the HOs scenes were even there but they do serve a purpose.  In some ways this game feels like an experiment in third person play by Jet Dogs Studios and reminscent of how Syberia and Niburu plays, without defined instructions on what to do or where to look.\n\nWorth a look and at least one playthrough just for the campy cheesiness of it.  (This would be perfect fodder for MSTies  (Mystery Science Theatre 3000)).","September 3, 2015","true","9.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","2"

The game itself is very straightforward and you can't get stuck on a puzzle if you wanted to, thanks to the unlimited hints system.\nThe puzzles are not at all difficult and won't be a problem to anyone, while the hidden object screens will occasionally annoy you with the low res graphics, but still won't be much of a problem.\n\nThe story is not trying to be serious at all, it almost felt like a parody in a way. The bad guy is a vampire that is apparently the one responsible for your finacee's disappearance, and you will have a chance to talk with him as the time goes on. The game is quite short, took  me less than 2 hours to finish.\n\nI did encounter some bugs while playing, like sometimes the graphics of a certain objects will disappear, or while in the hidden object scene, every click of the mouse will exit the screen until you go back to the main menu and reenter the game from there.\n\nVoice acting was ok, I've heard better, but it's tolerable. All in all, if you like hidden object games you are probably gonna like this one too. If you have never played a HO game, you probably want to try a better game to see if you'll like the genre.\n\n+ decent voice acting\n+ mostly bug-free\n+ cheap\n\n- quite short\n- not  very innovative\n- some low res graphics\n- a few bugs\n\nIf you like the genre, go ahead and buy it (it's really cheap), and if not you might wanna skip this one, although with this price tag, you can't go too wrong.     6/10","December 30, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You will spend the entire hour or so of this game in constant fear and...Whoops!\n\nGot my intros mixed up.\n\nYour fiance has been kidnapped by a vampire! Are you a bad enough dud to rescue your fiance?! Action and adventure await in Sinister City!\n\nHmm..Nope...That one kinda sucks too.\n\nTruth is, there's not much to discuss when it comes to Sinister City. Not too long ago, this game was on sale for around 10 cents. On top of that, it has cards, so you're all but guaranteed to profit off of the purchase. Therefore, I'm going to assume that you already own this game, and are just reading this review because you assume there will be some funny jokes.\n\n\nYou know what they say about assumptions right?\n\nIn the interest of being "helpful" I'll talk about the actual game. Sinister City is a hidden-object puzzler. Look for the object, find the object, click on the object, become a winner. I must warn you though, the objects tend to be hidden. Occasionally there are puzzles to break up the monotony, but nothing too strenuous. For those exceedingly rare situations that you're actually stuck, a handy "HELP!" button is always nearby.\n\nNot all hidden-object games are equal, and Sinister City is IMO an example of a mediocre one. The images are of a lower resolution, which makes objects muddy and difficult to spot. Yeah I know, it sounds ironic when you think about it, but bear with me on this. Another unfortunate technical issue is the prevalence of bugs. These can range from disappearing images to the game no longer properly responding to your inputs. Thankfully, these are usually cleared up by quitting to the main menu. The game saves automatically and constantly, so all you have to fear is those wacky vampires, not the possibility of losing progress.\n\nThe following couple paragraphs include SPOILERS!\n\n\n----SPOILERS----\n\nThis next aspect is not so much a complaint about Sinister City, but about adventure games in general. All too often they rely on this logic that is baffling to normal human behavior. At one point in this game you have to find some books so that somebody will talk to you. There is an abandoned bookstand nearby, but the protagonist doesn't want to steal the books. In order to pay for these $20 books, he finds 75 cents in loose change scattered on the ground. If that made too much sense, consider that the protagonist steals a key from the bookstore to open a mailbox.\n\nSinister City's attempts at humor are also...pretty laughable. Early on the protagonist acquires some vampire hunting equipment. He's getting geared up to kill a vampire, but then some guy points out that not everything is as it seems. The protagonist takes a closer look at a stake he picked up, and he finds the words "MADE IN CHINA" engraved on it. The "Made in China" gag is as old as time, but it doesn't work when written on a stake. A stake is a piece of wood sharpened to a point. It's possible that the Chinese stake is actually made of soft rubber, but wouldn't the protag notice that? Here's a thought: Crosses are also commonly used to fight vampires. So how about having the Cross say "MADE IN CHINA". Eh? Eh? Okay whatever. The point is this, when you're trying to make a gag out of something that's almost impossible to screw up, it doesn't really work. Yes, I have a nasty habit of nitpicking. What can I say? I love talking about mistakes.\n\n----END OF SPOILERS! YOU CAN BREATHE EASY NOW.----\n\n\nEven with its faults, Sinister City is still an enjoyable romp. It doesn't take itself seriously at all, the voice-acting is amazing, and the game ends before you get tired of it. I'm not usually one to recommend bad games - even the ones that are "purposefully" bad - simply because they take too long to complete. This game delivers on hidden objects and puzzles, which is always nice to have when you're not in the mood for more Counterstrike or DOTA2 or Sakura Angels. It's nothing difficult, but at least it'll give you something to do if you have an hour or so to burn.","August 30, 2015","true","5.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/recommended/326180/","espresso651","Espresso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/","281 products in account","In Sum: Playable but not great hidden object game with some glaring flaws. Do not buy at full price.  3/5\n\nThis is another grudgingly recommended game, which I would have preferred a neutral rating on.  This is not a horrible game, and I have suffered a share of stinkers on Steam.  It is just a hidden object game, not much more or less than that, and I suspect a lot of the objection here is due to the casual nature of the game.  However even as a genre, within hidden object games, there is something to be desired.\n\nThe concept is seemingly inspired by Dracula and early vampire movies that novel inspired, but with a twist that comes off somewhat amusing but not pulled off as well as, say, a similar theme in Magicka.  Unlike most hidden object games, you actually get to play a character and move around some parts of the game.  The visuals are actually decent for the non-searching parts of the game, and the voice acting is not bad.  It feels like it would have been a well-received, even high quality game in 1998.  I am not saying that the graphics are that ancient, just that I can't help but recall the casual  games of that era.\n\nThe game consists of exploring very small areas for hidden objects, talking to NPCs, and solving puzzles.  Through playing, you effectively unlock search quests where you must find a certain number of specified items.  In some areas, there are item lists that must also be found before a quest item is revealed.  Once the quest is completed, a puzzle must be solved.  The puzzles are not complicated in the least.\n\nSome HO games are difficult for various reasons, including devious trickery in design, such as putting similar looking objects, wordplay in clues, shifting images, interactive objects, and so on.  This game uses it's own method of frustrating the player, and it unfortunately is not very satisfying.  The objects are often hidden behind other objects that are not related to the puzzle (like a book or a plate), which must be clicked on to reveal the item underneath.  Makes it hard to search for something that isn't there.  Worst of all, the lighting and visibility of the objects is often terrible, to the point where I found myself clicking the screen randomly...and still succeeding!  Despite screen settings, the images can be so dim that they are practially not there, and I am sure on some monitors, would not show up at all.  And with the secret movable items and the poor display of items, and a lack of consequence for random clicking, it can become as much of a clicking game as Cookie Clicker...but without managers.\n\nSome seem to say that the objects are hard to find because they are not what people are expecting.  I have played many hidden object games, and as far as the genre goes, this one is actually very good at properly telling you what you are looking for.\n\nThere are two major glitches, however.  If you are using Windows 7 or above, you will need to set the game to XP compatibility mode, or it won't even launch.  Sometimes during the game, you will not be able to interact with environments after a cutscene.  Going to the main menu then resuming will fix this.\n\nAll together, it is an acceptable HO game, purely casual and good for destressing or a waste of time.  On the easiest mode, there is no pressure and no consequence for wrong, and the soundtrack is not bad at all.  It was worth the 9 cents, but not the $10 full price by any means.","August 24, 2015","true","4.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The game is simple, the graphics are basic and the sound/voice acting are mediocre compared to others of the same genre that I've played.  I hit a couple graphical bugs where the screen had white boxes covering up part of the hidden object scene.  I also had a bug where after finding an object in the hidden object scene it kicked me out of the scene and back to the main game.  This made it very tedious and frustrating, when casual gaming should not bring up these types of situations and emotions.  The goal is save your girlfriend from a vampire in Sinister City.  The game would be easily recommended even with its below par graphics and sound if the bugs were fixed.  I played the game twice to get all achievements, and both times I experienced these bugs.","September 27, 2015","false","12.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

When doing the hint button it can be spooky as a it sounds like that and also I have seen the negative views and some people did experience bugs, but I never did and was able to play the game till the end. If not using the hint system to solve puzzles then it can take longer as you are doing them on your own.\n\nSometimes some objects can be tricky  but still enjoyable and also worth the price as the game is well made and more character development could of been added in and maybe more vampires trying to stop you form reaching your goal. This is worth the money and time as it is only a few hours, and have noticed that when collecting objects more get thrown in and you spend more time finding objects since the story is not that strong and still good to pass the time.","August 30, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ganondork/recommended/326180/","ganondork","Ganondork","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ganondork/","159 products in account","This game is a perfect example of why I wish Steam had a "Meh." option, instead of just yes or no to a recommendation.\n\nI have played several point-and-click, hidden object games at this point, and there are definitely some things that Sinister City does that I appreciate, albeit not well enough to not be a bit, frankly, dumb.\n\nHere's the break-down for me, + signs being positives and - being negatives.\n+Incorporation of 3-dimensional character models. While most games of this type simply present you with a two-dimensional scene, in this you do actually have to move the protagonist, John, around in a space.\n- However, on that same note, the areas where you can move are more or less two-dimensional and not all of them seem to have been designed with a character walking around them in mind. This results in some frankly hilarious looking scenes, like John and the TV Station security guard just hovering above the ground in front of the TV station, as if they were part of the door and not actual characters.\n+ Voice Acting - for a casual game of this type, it's actually really good.\n- Except for John's voice. And he's the main character. So he talks all the time. (Ipkis is pretty bad too but you only have to talk to him a couple times)\n- The background music isn't bad, but it is extremely repetitive.\n- Game is short, even for a HOP game.\n+ Price. Guys for real, it's a dollar. Even if you end up despising it, are you really gonna cry over that dollar?\n+ Story...it's satirical of your typical spooky vampire motif, which is actually genuinely amusing at times. Not funny, but amusing. Worthy of a slight smirk. Also, John and Nina's lovey-dovey-ness is so over the top that it becomes a humorous exaggeration of dime-a-dozen love stories. Whether or not this was intentional is debatable, but seeing it as satire makes it more bearable.\n- Story ... buuuuutttt a lot of it feels rushed and nonsensical, even for a game about a town full of vampires (who completely openly exist and no one really questions it....?). Spoiler free example: When your character finds out his fiancee is being held in a town full of vampires, he at no point stops and says, "Woah, man. Slow your roll. VAMPIRES? Vampires are real?" He's basically Anakin Skywalker in Episode 3 of Star Wars, but without the death, ("Oh my god, what have I done? Waaaahhhhhhh"  ... "So you wanna join the Dark Side?" ... "Yeah, okay.") He just immediately accepts something that you would think would be a hell of a revelation for your average human dude who just wants to get married.\n- Saw the last bit of the ending coming a mile away.\n+ All the characters actually have a unique design and personalities, however minimal those personalities may be.\n+ Several objects in the HOPs were genuinely difficult to find, which I like.\n- But all the other minigames were horrendously easy.\n\nAll in all, it really is a "meh" kind of thing for me. I didn't like it, but I didn't dislike it. Had it been fleshed out more into a bigger and longer story, and more time taken on animation, it could have been really good. The developers definitely have some skill; it's just in need of serious refinement.\nI labeled it as recommended in the end because of the price. It's only a buck, and there are definitely worse things to do when you're bored, and worse games that I've played for more money--on sale.","November 6, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here we go.\n\nI knew from the Jet Dog Studios intro that this was, in fact, something I would enjoy.\n\nThe voices do not match up to mouth animations. I was not deterred.\n\nFirst time leading man talks, his spoken lines do not match up to what is written in the text box.\n\nClassic wheelin' and dealin' from receptionist. Thumbs up.\n\nFirst creepy scene. You know what I mean(no spoilers). Was actually pretty good. Thumbs up. Short and sweet.\n\nIn my youth, I loved Where's Waldo and the knock-offs, but I-Spy wasn't my thing, so the gameplay is knocked down a little due to a bias against. Although, the way the puzzles are introduced is well done.\n\n\n-Glitch Report #1: After being locked in Astral Plane and told to search for mirror pieces, the game would not let me click on anything except to walk around. Had to return to main menu and continue. This fixed the issue.\n\n-Glitch Report #2: When I reloaded to fix glitch #1, while I can click to search areas, when i click to check or pick up an item, it brings back to the walking section. Everytime. This makes searching very tedious.\n\n-Glitch Report #3: I reloaded, but #2 prevailed. So I continue, despite frustration. This lead to accessing a puzzle and half the items are whited out. Impossible to search for everything. Correction: I found everything very easily as they were about half of what was actually visible. Nice.... for a while. Until the items are in the white areas. Eventually have to keep using hints to show me where they are, so I can click them. Now I have to repair the mirror and half the screen is white.\n\n-Glitch Report #4: I have one piece left. everytime i try to put it in place, it askes me "Are you sure you want to skip puzzle?" I keep saying no.\n\nGlitches subside. Will let me take garlic and knives to a fight, but not the guns. I even had to find a bullet in a puzzle. I have at least one. Let me take the gun. Thumbs down.\n\nOrlock didn't notice I was preparing a truth potion right in his fire? Got to Tv Station. I'm kinda bored, and was gifted two wishlist games. I'll go there for now.\n\nRecommend: For ISpy fans, yes. Umm....4/5 for what it is. A find-the-item-puzzle game with a few walking sequences between puzzles and a very cheesy "hollywood" vampire love story. Might finish someday.","November 13, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

And for the most part, I got just that. Horror-trope homages, nice graphics, and a good variety of puzzles. The part of this game I did not like that caused me not to recommend this game? The hidden objects aspect of it. More than half of the time I spent in this game is looking for hidden objects to advance to the next segment of the game. I wouldn’t mind it so much if the hidden objects puzzle appeared once or twice, but it appears in every area I go to and it gets to be really tedious after the third area in the game.","May 21","false","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

These are sometimes hidden behind things in the scene, which you have to click on to move & reveal what you're looking for. But these concealing objects won't move out of the way if you click on them before you've gotten the collection task for the object they're in front of, which seems to me like cheating, in a way.\n\nAnd since there is no apparent penalty for mis-clicks, and no clue that something is moveable in this way, the best strategy is often to just spam the screen with clicks everywhere, in case something comes into view.\n\nThe hit zones for hidden objects are also remarkably large, so you just have to click sorta kinda *near* what you're looking for. Several times, I was able to pick up multiple things by clicking repeatedly in exactly the same place.\n\nAspect ratio is messed up - it's obviously a 4:3 screen stretched to 16:9, in both full-screen and windowed mode. Text size & placement was also messed up on my 3840x2160 screen, and doesn't reset properly when switching from windowed to full-screen without closing & reopening. All-in-all, not one I can recommend.","July 13, 2015","false","3.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Even adding a maybe button would be enough.  Now that that's been said, this game.\n\nSinister City is a point-and-click hidden-object game, in the vein of the Mystery Case Files series.  For only being 99 cents, it isn't the worst game in the genre.  It doesn't stack up to the aforementioned MCF series, but for what it's worth, you could do much worse.\n\nYou play as a human guy whose bride-to-be is a vampire.  Her father doesn't want her marrying a non-vampire (for hopefully obvious reasons), so he LOCKS HER IN A CAGE.  To free her, you need to complete a series of puzzles that aren't hard at all.  I played through the game in full, and only clocked in about 2 hours.\n\nI have to give credit to Jetdogs Studios for getting some decent voice talent in this game.  Whether or not I recommend this game to you is dependent on whether or not it looks interesting to you.  If so, then yes, and vice versa.  This game gets my Seal of Approval.  Just, don't play for the plot.  And if you do, keep a state-of-mind altering substance of your choice at the ready.","January 24","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Did you think that you’ll never find a hidden object game on par with The Flying Dutchman? You were wrong.\n\nBecause this game is bad. Astonishingly, mind-numbingly bad. For starters, it fails as a hidden object game with almost completely empty scenes. Don’t put much hope in the puzzles either, they are about as complex as a slab of stone.\nAnd there is the story. Oh gods, the story. It has an interesting premise, sure: vampires are an everyday part of society, they work like anybody else. But unlike True Blood, this one was written by dumb people for dumber people. The plot is stupid. The characters are even more stupid. And the dialogues… the dialogues make a five-year old child’s screenplay look like Oscar Award material.\n\nBut!

I paid 15p for it in a sale and i'd be annoyed if i'd paid any more than that for what the game offers, especially as in total it offers around 4 hours gametime for 2 play-through's on both modes.\n"Normal" mode though is a joke as if you just stop to look for 5 seconds then the screen lights-up telling you where everything is, it doesn't give you nearly enough time to search for yourself.\n\nObjects to be moved bear no distinction to background objects. So often you will find you cannot see what you need on the screen and you have no way of knowing which objects can be pushed aside to reveal more.\nThe only way to get around this is to play it on "Normal" difficulty and have the game tell you where you're supposed to be going next then remember for the next time. I can't imagine playing "Advanced" mode without this knowledge; it would be uber-frustrating.\n\nThe game is locked to a 4:3 image stretched to widescreen: there is no option to reset the ratio. This is the first and only game that has ever done this to me so i just ignored it and played regardless; not going to upset my gfx settings for 1 game.\n\nOverall it's a thumbs-down from me, there are much better HOG's out there and you only really need play this one if you've literally exhausted the other offerings out there.","September 25, 2015","false","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes, sir..But it was worth every second to endure the exciting tale of you, John, some guy and your wife..soon to be wife..Nina, who is staying with her vampire Dad Orlok in SINISTER CITY (where the bats do crap and the wits are ♥♥♥♥♥♥..) and you are trying to WHATEVER, THIS IS GARBAGE !","January 22, 2015","false","1.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","42","5","12","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/326180/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Sinister City, developed by JetDogs Studios, puts you in the shoes of John, and man who is sent on a quest to chase after his Fiancée Nina. The thing is that Nina just up and left John to go to a strange city of darkness and vampires. You will have to find your way through hidden object puzzles, collection puzzles, and many more different types of puzzles if you hope to rescue Nina.\n\nGraphically it feels a bit dated, but then again judging from some of the wording used in the game I'm going to say that this was a port of a tablet game. That being said there's nothing wrong with the look of the game. You will be interacting in a 3d environment broken down into five main areas, and of those areas there are several "rooms" you wil get to interact with in order to advance the storyline. The vampire modeling makes the game feel like a cheesy B-movie, but I think that's what the developers were going for, so in other words they nailed it.\n\nThe voice acting was interesting. Almost every character sounded like they were just reading lines, and it just didn't feel like there was any energy put into it. The only character that was really believable was the vampire that was supposed to be the TV star.\n\nYou are going to use the mouse for everything in this game, when it comes to controls. Basically you are going to click and drag, or just click your way through this game.\n\nSo here's the deal, as cheesy as the storyline was I enjoyed the game, when it worked, and that was the problem with this game. There were several times where after I solved a puzzle and I tried to go on to the next puzzle or thing, I had issues. For example when I am trying to collect items after solving a puzzle, I would go into the next piece of the game where several items are present and after clicking on the screen, anywhere, I automatically exited back out to the area. Then there was the issue of this game only has autosave, which is fine, but I really wish there was a reset button that would reset the scene of a certain piece of the game because during one of the times I had to collect several different items, I was unable to collect the last one, even with the hint indicator highlighting it. I tried restarting the game, steam, and lastly my computer. None of these things work, and so I had to start the game all over again from scratch.\n\nThere's also the subtitles, or text that the characters are supposed to be saying, you know when you hear the audio how it is supposed to line up to what is written on the screen? Well its all over the place, sometimes its correct, but most times its hit or miss. The context might be mostly the same but the phrasing and words are completely different. At the end of the day I'm going to have to say that even though this game was enjoyable there were just a couple too many bumps in this game to make it worthwhile for anyone who isn't willing to wrestle with the game doing strange things. So with that I have to give this game a 5.3 out of 10.","October 23, 2014","true","2.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

Sinister City really brings out the C-Grade horror flick vibe with its cruddy voice acting and spectacularly cheesy dialogue. Not to mention the entire plot of the game, which is to get your bride-to-be, Nina, back from Count Orlok. There's also a hefty side of tongue-in-cheek references; Nosferatu, Lugosi, and even the name Orlok are all cultural references.\n\nBugs, bugs eeeeeeeverywhere. And I'm not just talking about little ones, this game full-on stops rendering important stuff. Like the city map, and the hidden object puzzles! The entire screen goes white, with bits and pieces floating around in nothingness. And they aren't always the items that you NEED to get either, making it incredibly difficult to find what you're looking for. Oh yeah, and the achievements don't function properly either. My first achievement? The one for not skipping any puzzles in the game. I hadn't even finished the first puzzle.\n\nAvoid at all cost, and for the love of Dracula don't even bother with it on sale. For me, this one came in some long forgotten bundle and I decided to try it out this Halloween. I can't recommend this title because of the horrid glitches, it's unforgivable really, but despite its super flaws I found myself enjoying the time spent playing the game.

It's a fun waste of time if your brain is looking for something to do but hardly anything groundbreaking or exciteing. The puzzles are fairly easy once you figure out what they want you to do and the only hard part seemed to be finding them, even in easy mode where things are suposed to tell you where to look I sometimes found myself randomly clicking around the room till I found something. Once you know where to click and what to look for odds are you'll beat it in an hour.\n\nThe plot is goofy and the overdramatic dialogue is worthy of a saturday morning cartoon but I think that was the actual intent this time, like the developers knew no one actualy takes the story part of a HOG seriously and decided to just have fun with it. While good for a laugh or two it's hardly engaging or suspenseful but considering it's dirt cheep you can't really expect Shakespeare.\n\nTaken for what it is, a cheep brain teaser with a B-movie plot then it's worth playing if only to score some easy acheaves or take a break from shooting zombies, but if your looking for something more serious I'd give this a pass.","November 28, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a few bugs and the gameplay isn't flawless. You never know if you found everything in a HO scene, because there isn't even an indicator wether you can find anything there or not, which means that wild clicking is the easiest and fastest way to finish it. There is no penalty for it even on advanced, The puzzles are so easy, that they are just there for making the game a little bit longer. If they are not too easy, then they are annoying. Sometimes you have no idea where to go or what to do.\n\nBUT! The story and how everything is told is so hillarious, that it compensates everything! It makes jokes about vampires, adventure games, hollywood and all the classic cliches about lovestories and movies in general. Sure, it has a hard start and you will probably need a little bit time to get in, but after that, it is really nice to watch the characters. Wish, that i could say the same for the actual gameplay, which is only "acceptable".\n\nSo if you are a hard boiled fan of HO games and horror-commedy, then you can have fun with it.","November 15, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Only fixable by restarting the game.\n- No fast travel, This shouldn't really be a complaint but when both of their other games have it and this one doesn't with even more back tracking it really needed it.\n- Normal hints on the puzzle are fine but this game really doesn't tell you where you need to go most of the time where the other two did via their fast travel system.\n\nOverall Score: 6/10 I was pretty harsh on this game, it was the first hidden object game I played by Jetdogs Studios and the least enjoyable. It's still a playable game and has a good amount of hidden object gameplay to it but it's just not quite the same quality as their other products. I would be giving it a 5 instead of a 6 due to the bug i encountered twice but I didn't see anyone else complaining about the same bug, Additionally the free soundtrack is a nice touch.\n\nIn the end if you need a hidden object game there are better to play and worse to play, If you enjoy games by Jetdogs by all means get this you can tell it's one of their games. But if you haven't played one by them play their other ones first, Save this one for later so you don't put yourself off of the experiances their games can provide.","September 25, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The amazing world building and dynamic characters are only the beginning, as they only scratch the surface of the actual genius and innovative gameplay.\n\nNow as opposed to todays RPG, shooting and action based this game takes a creative path in making you think deeply about your choices, as you uncover the mystery of what happened to your missing wife. You're always forced to stay focused and look for subtle clues in your enviroment, and the aesthetics just makes the experience a whole lot better.\n\nWhen I first saw this game on steam I was unsure about it's directional capabilities, however I found myself surprised by the sheer level of thought and care taken into crafting such a epic and emotionally investing story that will keep you thinking about it for days on end. I would have to give this game a solid 20/10 and I hope that more people will be able to experience this hidden gem amongst the rocks. -Aru","November 14, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a little dull at times, and the excuses for making you go find stuff were lame, but it was a couple of hours of mild entertainment for almost nothing.\n\nThe characters who inhabit Hidden Object Games are some of the messiest people I've ever seen - I'm no longer surprised by the piles of junk they seem to have in all their cupboards and corners and desks.  Unfortunately in this game, some of the objects you were asked to find were barely visible behind other objects (just a tiny piece poking out), were hard to see clearly, were named oddly, or were completely hidden behind other objects that you probably wouldn't know you could move unless the hint sparkles told you so...\n\nSpeaking of which, the 'easy' mode was far too easy.  Pause in your random clicking for mere seconds and the game would show you what you needed to find, without you asking it for help.  That said, though, some tasks or locations seemed so obscure that I'm not sure I would have known I could look closer at a particular spot in the room if it hadn't shown me.\n\nI did encounter one bug, where the game refused to respond to my clicking and I thought I'd have to restart, but it was fixed by going to the main menu and then continuing the game.  Other than that, the only issues I encountered were with the clicks picking up objects I wasn't actually clicking on in some cases, which may have something to do with it apparently being a mobile port (I presume, what with it telling you to 'tap here' or to swipe the screen in order to complete a mini game).\n\nI had a few laughs while playing, and especially at the end credits - I'm not sure I would have been happy to pay full price even though it IS cheap, but on sale it's worth a play through.  Just don't expect anything serious and you'll be okay!  :)","August 31, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is corny and the reasons for you to clear nearby closets and trunks of lists worth of various objects grow increasingly absurd as it unfolds. Some actual puzzles are thrown in here and there which adds a bit of variation to simply looking for various items in the scenery. If you get stuck you can have the hint-system flat out show you what to do next, and any actual puzzle can be skipped for those who are just in it for mindless clicking.The game is a short affair, and I can't imagine it having much replay value, but it should be good for wasting a short hour for anyone who are into the hidden object style of games.\n\nOn a side note, the game did glitch out pretty severely on the second "act" when I played it, with both broken textures and issues with the game mechanics, but this was solved by simply restarting the game and continuing from the autosave.","January 1","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I finally figured it out about halfway through that it is meant to be hilariously bad -- but it shouldn't have taken me that long to get it.\n\nSo, ignore the voice acting and story, both of which are either bad or hilariously bad.  As a hidden object game, it's okay.  It has two modes: easy mode and advanced mode.  I wish there were a middle one.  In easy mode, if you don't find an object or a location within a few seconds, it will sparkle for you.  So you might as well just mindlessly click wherever is sparkling and you could finish the game with absolutely no brain power on your part at all.  But in advanced mode, sometimes locations were finicky to find, so I spent several minutes just clicking randomly around the screen before giving up and switching to "easy" mode just long enough to get the hint, and then switching back.\n\nI enjoy hidden object games as a mental break.  This one took me about 2 hours to finish.  For the price I paid (a few cents, on sale), it was a fine way to spend an evening.

Actors they are definitely not.\nThe game itself is so full of bugs you will not be able to solve it without repeatedly restarting the whole thing, and even then your success is not guaranteed. If you're just after trading cards (may that invention burn in hell), then ok, buy it and let it run on background while doing something worth your time. But if it's a game you want, just forget it, this is not a game.","April 13","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Alchemy Mysteries - Prague Legends, being one that I played prior to this. That game showed the talent and the creativity of the developer in this genre, and Sinister City is not even on the same scale.\n\nI enjoy HOGs, but the story, voice acting, puzzles, map, and even the hidden object scenes were annoying. I just couldn't get into the game. Add an occasional bug that refused to allow you to click on objects without either exiting to menu or even the game, before continuing, just added to the frustration.\n\nThe game tries to create comedic atmosphere, and a unique world and just fails in both.","April 23","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure, it's not the best game ever made, but it is one of the best hidden object games that I've ever played. This game has a pretty good, but simple story, unlike most hidden object games that don't even have a story.\n\nThe only con I had with the game is that there were probably a dozen or so places where the audio said something different from the subtitles. It kind of took me out of the story for a second, but it wasn't a deal breaker.\n\nThe game clocked in at right under two hours, and I was able to finish it in one sitting, but it sure was fun filled.

Once you play for a little bit it bugs out to where you can't click to get into the hidden object areas. And the only way I've found to fix it is to completely close out of the game and reopen it. That really ruins any fun the game could have had and makes things difficult for people like myself who records games online.\n\nMaybe if that bug gets fixed, I'll come back and revise my review.","June 2","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only fixable by restarting the game.\n- No fast travel, This shouldn't really be a complaint but when both of their other games have it and this one doesn't with even more back tracking it really needed it.\n- Normal hints on the puzzle are fine but this game really doesn't tell you where you need to go most of the time where the other two did via their fast travel system.\n\nOverall Score: 6/10 I was pretty harsh on this game, it was the first hidden object game I played by Jetdogs Studios and the least enjoyable. It's still a playable game and has a good amount of hidden object gameplay to it but it's just not quite the same quality as their other products. I would be giving it a 5 instead of a 6 due to the bug i encountered twice but I didn't see anyone else complaining about the same bug, Additionally the free soundtrack is a nice touch.\n\nIn the end if you need a hidden object game there are better to play and worse to play, If you enjoy games by Jetdogs by all means get this you can tell it's one of their games. But if you haven't played one by them play their other ones first, Save this one for later so you don't put yourself off of the experiances their games can provide.","September 25, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Some minor bugs and annoying mechanics are out-weighed by the exceedingly low price and the genuinely fun story and dialogue. If you enjoy the genre and you enjoy a good B-movie story, you should have a reasonably good time for a low price.\n\nReviewYou play as John, a generic American guy looking for his missing bride who apparently got kidnapped by her vampire father. You chase her to the titular Sinister City, the haven of all that is unholy. If that sounds rather silly, don’t worry, that’s the point. Not at any point are you supposed to be taking the game’s story seriously. That, combined with competent voice actors and well-written silly dialogue, provided a good amount of fun for me. Luckily the game does not last long enough (I finished it on advanced mode with all achievements in apparently 2.6 hours according to steam) or use the silliness too ham-fistedly for it to grow stale. I especially liked how they incorporated the silly story with the already silly “go find X items” or “go fix my Z” missions that are the staple of hidden object games. It made it amusing instead of just silly.\n\nThe mechanics of the game were not the best admittedly. The hidden objects and mini-games were decidedly average for the genre coupled with an annoying tendency to have items hidden by other items with no indication that you can interact with the covering item. For example you are in a bookshop looking for item X. Item X is hidden behind a book… you need to click the right book to show it, but your cursor will not change as you hover over it. So basically you need to click all the books in the scene to show it. Sometimes it is more obvious which item is the covering one, but quite frequently you need to click a huge number of random items to find the right one. Which is not great design. However, there are no penalties for misclicks and there is a robust hint-system so when you get used to it, it’s not a huge deal (using the hint-system will costs you an achievement though if you care about that).\n\nThough old areas remain open as you open new ones, the items you need to find is always in the new areas or the game makes it obvious that you need to return to an old area (like, a character tells you to go back to the castle) so there is no annoying backtracking.\n\nPeople have reported a lot of bugs it seems. I only ran into one in one area and it was partially fixed by exiting to the main menu and totally fixed by restarting the game.\n\nOverall, I had a good time with Sinister City. I enjoyed the silly dialogue and story. The mechanics were nothing exciting, but I quite enjoy the genre so that was fine. For the price (I got it for 0.99 euro) I would definitely say it is worth it.","August 20, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

You've come to Sinister City because your fiance has been kidnapped. Sinister City is where vampires live... or something? It's hardly explained, but apparently vampires and other supernatural monsters are not just fully accepted in this world but also big business.\n\nI get what they're going for, a comical deconstruction of vampire tropes strung together with hidden object sequences, but the jokes tend to fall flat. What's worse, far worse, is that there are several glaring bugs in this less-than-two-hour game. Just after the main villain got revealed (your fiance's father objecting to your marriage) I got stuck and only after exiting back out to the menu and returning did it allow me to progress. Later on, at the big finale (...or what passes for it anyway) every click in a hidden object scene not only clicked something but also exited the scene. It was still possible to progress, but it was frustratingly tedious to automatically exit and then manually re-enter each scene after every single click. The icing on the cake is that the very last sequence even had its background bugging out, just showing the clickable items on a white background. Comical deconstruction indeed.\n\nWith the Artifex Mundi games also available on Steam there is no reason at all to pick this up.","June 3, 2015","false","2.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

For what it is, it can be quite a deal. Achievements and Badge progress for profile progression are always a good thing in my book so i give props when it comes to that. As for the "game" itself, and i say that quite loose, It is what it is. Being a more or less point and click adventure and a discovery title, the gameplay is rather stale. The story and graphics are nice enough for the pricetag the developer posts for the product and the OST is given to the player as a gift for purchase which is also a bonus. It is impossible to fail at this game, and the achievements can all be earned in a single playthrough (which takes even the sluggish of sifters maybe 1 or 2 hours max) making this a steam perfect game in no time at all. You play John, a man in search for his missing wife to be, whom was kidnapped by a mysterious vampire of sorts. Solve unique puzzles, locate objects to progress the world of Sinister City and meet many colorful and strange characters on the path to happiness. Cant really knock on this game too much. Not much to knock on.\n\nDecent enough game. Worth a look for anyone with a couple spare dollars and a desire to find things behind things. And also, Vampire demon teletubbies and cheeseburgers.

The hidden object scenes only give you a few items at a time, and you can't move on to the next part of the list until you've found all of them. The mouse pointer doesn't give any indication of what's clickable, so sometimes an object will be behind something else in a scene, and you don't know what you can move unless you just frantically click on everything. There's no indication of area transitions, either, so even the most basic action of moving from place to place gets irritating. Plus there's a bug where sometimes the game won't register ANY area transitions as being clickable, so you're stuck unless you restart the game.\n\nI bought this in a bundle with 6 other games for $1.89 and I still think I paid too much.\n\nEDIT: Went back to finish the game. I think the area transition issue was fixed since I wrote my initial review, but I got some buggy minigames. (At least you can skip those.) The biggest issue for me was still the lack of a context-sensitive mouse cursor.\n\nI do like how the adventure game-style gameplay and art set this apart from the many samey-looking hidden object games out there, but it's not good enough to make this worth playing.","October 29, 2014","false","1.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

It's a tongue-in-cheek vampire Hidden Object Game (HOG) that's got good graphics, nice puzzles and mini-games, and darn good voice acting (far better than the norm for the HOG genre).  The story is simple but interesting and the poking of fun at normal HOGs is really well done.  But, the game does suffer from bugs and some irritating design decision.\n\nThe poor design decisions are firstly that if you're playing the game in either Easy or Advanced mode, the cursor does not change to indicate hot, live, or actionable areas.  That means that as you search the scene, you have no idea if you can pick something up, use something, open a HOG or mini-game, talk to someone, or even just leave the scene.  Easy mode puts a sparkle on the screen after a few seconds for the next thing you should be doing.  But, you end up watching for that and blindly following it instead of thinking about what's showing.  In Advanced mode, there's no sparkle.  So, you're essentially reduced to just clicking on everything possible in the hopes that something will happen.  Secondly, the mini-games have no instructions at all.  It's not just that there's nothing telling you how you need to manipulate things.  It's also that there's no explanation of what the win-state (i.e., what you're supposed to do) is.  And finally, In the HOGs, the items you're searching for can be so small as to be indistinguishable.  Similarly, the HOG scenes usually have in-focus/out-of-focus, lighted/non-lighted areas implying where you're supposed to be looking for things.  Nope.  The items can be anywhere at all (the out of focus ones were a real treat).\n\nAs for bugs, I first tried playing the game in Advanced mode.  I quickly got to a point where nothing I clicked on would activate anything.  I could do no HOGs nor leave the scene.  I had to start a new game in Easy mode to play.  There are also several places where the character floats over the pavement.  In one such scene, there IS no pavement.  The characters are both floating in air.\n\nIt's a shame that those issues are spoiling an otherwise very good game.  But, at the current list price of $0.99, I can live with it (it took me 2.4 hours for my playthrough on Easy -- but I still have to go through on Advanced to get 100% Achievements).  So, I'm recommending the game.\n\nEDIT:  I've confirmed the bug I ran into earlier.  In Advanced mode, once you're given the task to collect the magic keys to unlock the mirror, none of the active points will activate.

You get what you pay for I guess. I recommend this since I was happy with my purchase, see the pros and cons though to see what exactly you're getting with the buck this game costs. Some of the things listed are strong matters of taste.\n\nThe review\n\nThis game is an extremely short and extremely easy hidden-object puzzle game. It's very silly and the whole plot is just finding your girlfriend, freeing her and [spoilers]kickstarting her vampire father's film career[/spoilers]. Voice acting is bad and the texts don't match the lines, but due to overall campy feel of the game I really didn't mind.\n\nGameplay consists of you mostly clicking a person / object and seeing what he / it wants / needs, finding the items from nearby and then usually solving a puzzle of sorts. Some of these necessary items are often hidden behind some other items that are involved in a hidden object game, totalling to about 11-16 items (5 at a time), the last of which usually has the final items you are looking for hidden behind them. It's really simple and usually you can just get through most of it by randomly clicking the obvious items in the scene. If you want all of the achievements though, check the items required and then click through 5 of them (the hidden objects, not the quest items) in 10 seconds to get the achievement, that's basically the only one needing bit more effort.\n\nThe puzzles are the most interesting part in this game (beside just seeing the silly plot and clunky conversations go by). Unfortunately there were like 2 or 3 puzzles requiring actual thought while the others were passable by randomly doing stuff or just matching things together. There's not much explanation to them, but they're so simple a child will understand their point, you really don't need the included hint system. (also there's an achievement if you don't!)\n\n- Funnily, you can actually tell the main character to walk somewhere in the scene, but it really has no function as clicking on hotspots trigger them immediately.\n\nThat's about it. Game really doesn't span far. I played it 100% through on hardest difficulty in ~2h. More lucky person can probably do it in less time. Well, here's the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n+ Cheap (like really, got it for 9 cents)\n+ Campy (got a few chuckles from some events, couple unexpectedly silly ones too)\n+ Money's worth of entertainment and ultra-light brain exercise\n+ Achievement icons look pretty cool\n+/- Easy even on hardest difficulty\n\nCons:\n- Some bugs (backgrounds messed up or characters floating in the backgrounds, also one time (in the psychic dimension) game didn't let me click any hotspots, closed and restarted the game and it worked again though)\n- Typos\n- Lame story (and there's barely any of it)\n- Harder puzzles can be calculated with a single quaternary digit\n- Finger got tired from all the basically useless random clicking\n+/- Bad acting\n+/- Easy even on hardest difficulty\n\nScore 6 / 10","August 28, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

The problem is that this game clearly isn't for everyone, the story was alright, but not the best. When I read the description, I thought, "Oh, maybe this game will be horror related perhaps or at least have that sense of 'scary' vampires as well as his future wife turning into a vampire possibly making him turn into a vampire." Although, instead it gives you more of a comedy like relief than anything else, to me it really ruined the whole dark, 'scary' vampire part that I wanted. If you want a puzzle related game with a story that has nothing to do with dark vampires, but instead gives you a light-hearted, childish related vampire scenario, then this is the game for you. Although, paying only a dollar just to get it wasn't a total waste of my money for I did enjoy the game.\n\nThe problem with this game is the lack of the horror element in the game, this is a vampire game after all and therefore the characters should feel scared. It's also easy to beat the game, I beat it the first time in roughly 3 in a half hours, although that was on 'easy' difficulty.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy the game, it was light-hearted, seemed more like a kids game than an adults game, especially with the 'find the items' part added into play. Do I recommend this to everyone, no, I only recommend this to people who want a light-hearted, puzzle related game that is kid friendly.\n\nI rate the game 7/10.","June 11, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

When doing the hint button it can be spooky as a it sounds like that and also I have seen the negative views and some people did experience bugs, but I never did and was able to play the game till the end. If not using the hint system to solve puzzles then it can take longer as you are doing them on your own.\n\nSometimes some objects can be tricky  but still enjoyable and also worth the price as the game is well made and more character development could of been added in and maybe more vampires trying to stop you form reaching your goal. This is worth the money and time as it is only a few hours, and have noticed that when collecting objects more get thrown in and you spend more time finding objects since the story is not that strong and still good to pass the time.","August 30, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am not a fan of HOG or point and click games, what made it for me was what more people is complaining about, the storyline. Yes, it is too cheesy and badly scripted, but that is what appealed to me. That and the low production value feeling from the nineties that that this gaame has to offer.\n\nAs an old school gamer these are days where I need to play many games before I find one to my liking, so I appreciate the enjoyment I got from this game, despite the short experience.\n\nI got this in a bundle but I saw that some reviewers are writing that the game is not worth the full price (3 EUR or 2 GBP) and to wait for a sale. Really? It is totally worth that amount. I have paid much more for AAA titles that gave me less enjoyment.\n\nI do recommend this game.","November 6, 2014","true","2.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

And for the most part, I got just that. Horror-trope homages, nice graphics, and a good variety of puzzles. The part of this game I did not like that caused me not to recommend this game? The hidden objects aspect of it. More than half of the time I spent in this game is looking for hidden objects to advance to the next segment of the game. I wouldn’t mind it so much if the hidden objects puzzle appeared once or twice, but it appears in every area I go to and it gets to be really tedious after the third area in the game.","May 21","false","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

These are sometimes hidden behind things in the scene, which you have to click on to move & reveal what you're looking for. But these concealing objects won't move out of the way if you click on them before you've gotten the collection task for the object they're in front of, which seems to me like cheating, in a way.\n\nAnd since there is no apparent penalty for mis-clicks, and no clue that something is moveable in this way, the best strategy is often to just spam the screen with clicks everywhere, in case something comes into view.\n\nThe hit zones for hidden objects are also remarkably large, so you just have to click sorta kinda *near* what you're looking for. Several times, I was able to pick up multiple things by clicking repeatedly in exactly the same place.\n\nAspect ratio is messed up - it's obviously a 4:3 screen stretched to 16:9, in both full-screen and windowed mode. Text size & placement was also messed up on my 3840x2160 screen, and doesn't reset properly when switching from windowed to full-screen without closing & reopening. All-in-all, not one I can recommend.","July 13, 2015","false","3.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Here it is then!\n\nLong version:Do you believe that Twilight was the worst thing to happen to vampire stories? Did you think that you’ll never find a hidden object game on par with The Flying Dutchman? You were wrong.\n\nBecause this game is bad. Astonishingly, mind-numbingly bad. For starters, it fails as a hidden object game with almost completely empty scenes. Don’t put much hope in the puzzles either, they are about as complex as a slab of stone.\nAnd there is the story. Oh gods, the story. It has an interesting premise, sure: vampires are an everyday part of society, they work like anybody else. But unlike True Blood, this one was written by dumb people for dumber people. The plot is stupid. The characters are even more stupid. And the dialogues… the dialogues make a five-year old child’s screenplay look like Oscar Award material.\n\nBut! If you can enjoy terrible movies like Plan 9, The Room, or Birdemic, then you will surely have a hilarious time with Sinister City.","April 24, 2015","false","1.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

The voice acting was decent and mindless clicking could find most of the objects. It used all the standard tricks of hiding objects behind scenery as well as having moving scenery.\n\nThe game also had various puzzles. If you didn't mind waiting, you could skip them, but they were fairly straight forward. I found them fairly enjoyable.\n\nThe game took under two hours and was well worth the 9 cents I paid.","August 29, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/326180/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Sinister City, developed by JetDogs Studios, puts you in the shoes of John, and man who is sent on a quest to chase after his Fiancée Nina. The thing is that Nina just up and left John to go to a strange city of darkness and vampires. You will have to find your way through hidden object puzzles, collection puzzles, and many more different types of puzzles if you hope to rescue Nina.\n\nGraphically it feels a bit dated, but then again judging from some of the wording used in the game I'm going to say that this was a port of a tablet game. That being said there's nothing wrong with the look of the game. You will be interacting in a 3d environment broken down into five main areas, and of those areas there are several "rooms" you wil get to interact with in order to advance the storyline. The vampire modeling makes the game feel like a cheesy B-movie, but I think that's what the developers were going for, so in other words they nailed it.\n\nThe voice acting was interesting. Almost every character sounded like they were just reading lines, and it just didn't feel like there was any energy put into it. The only character that was really believable was the vampire that was supposed to be the TV star.\n\nYou are going to use the mouse for everything in this game, when it comes to controls. Basically you are going to click and drag, or just click your way through this game.\n\nSo here's the deal, as cheesy as the storyline was I enjoyed the game, when it worked, and that was the problem with this game. There were several times where after I solved a puzzle and I tried to go on to the next puzzle or thing, I had issues. For example when I am trying to collect items after solving a puzzle, I would go into the next piece of the game where several items are present and after clicking on the screen, anywhere, I automatically exited back out to the area. Then there was the issue of this game only has autosave, which is fine, but I really wish there was a reset button that would reset the scene of a certain piece of the game because during one of the times I had to collect several different items, I was unable to collect the last one, even with the hint indicator highlighting it. I tried restarting the game, steam, and lastly my computer. None of these things work, and so I had to start the game all over again from scratch.\n\nThere's also the subtitles, or text that the characters are supposed to be saying, you know when you hear the audio how it is supposed to line up to what is written on the screen? Well its all over the place, sometimes its correct, but most times its hit or miss. The context might be mostly the same but the phrasing and words are completely different. At the end of the day I'm going to have to say that even though this game was enjoyable there were just a couple too many bumps in this game to make it worthwhile for anyone who isn't willing to wrestle with the game doing strange things. So with that I have to give this game a 5.3 out of 10.","October 23, 2014","true","2.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

Sinister City really brings out the C-Grade horror flick vibe with its cruddy voice acting and spectacularly cheesy dialogue. Not to mention the entire plot of the game, which is to get your bride-to-be, Nina, back from Count Orlok. There's also a hefty side of tongue-in-cheek references; Nosferatu, Lugosi, and even the name Orlok are all cultural references.\n\nBugs, bugs eeeeeeeverywhere. And I'm not just talking about little ones, this game full-on stops rendering important stuff. Like the city map, and the hidden object puzzles! The entire screen goes white, with bits and pieces floating around in nothingness. And they aren't always the items that you NEED to get either, making it incredibly difficult to find what you're looking for. Oh yeah, and the achievements don't function properly either. My first achievement? The one for not skipping any puzzles in the game. I hadn't even finished the first puzzle.\n\nAvoid at all cost, and for the love of Dracula don't even bother with it on sale. For me, this one came in some long forgotten bundle and I decided to try it out this Halloween. I can't recommend this title because of the horrid glitches, it's unforgivable really, but despite its super flaws I found myself enjoying the time spent playing the game.

I almost would regret it if it weren't for the corny story.\n\nIt starts off normal enough, John has to rescue his Nina from vampires. Then you realize everything is light hearted and not dark nor sinister. I found myself groaning more than once over the story but overall I laughed at it and enjoyed it for all it's horribleness.

I.E. hotspots are not visible to the player.\n\nThere were 2 pros to the game.  The first was the character detail and the second was the plot.  Note that the plot is very cheesy, but it works in this game.  I enjoyed the plot enough (and some of the voicing and visuals) that I'm very tempted to recommend the game.  But, the overall polish, length of game, and bugs that exist in such a game that clearly isn't being updated is unforgiveable IMHO.  If you can pick this up in a bundle, its worth playing.

By doing various quests he finds out about his bride.\n\nNor Cons Nor Pros:\n-Picked square white thing and aapparently it was a key.\n-Had bugged twice with buttons (had restart game twice)\n-Dialogues don't go on themself\n\nWorth buying it. 99ct c'mon people this game has everything that you can want for 99ct dialogues, cinematic entrys, puzzles, mysteries.

Great game for kids I guess.\n\nThe trailer for this game presents itself as something dark and dramatic, like you'd expect from other popular hidden object games, but really it isn't.

Definitely worth the dollar if it's what you're into.\n\nIf you've played hidden object before, you know what your getting into.  Nothing is advancing the genre here.

It was a little dull at times, and the excuses for making you go find stuff were lame, but it was a couple of hours of mild entertainment for almost nothing.\n\nThe characters who inhabit Hidden Object Games are some of the messiest people I've ever seen - I'm no longer surprised by the piles of junk they seem to have in all their cupboards and corners and desks.  Unfortunately in this game, some of the objects you were asked to find were barely visible behind other objects (just a tiny piece poking out), were hard to see clearly, were named oddly, or were completely hidden behind other objects that you probably wouldn't know you could move unless the hint sparkles told you so...\n\nSpeaking of which, the 'easy' mode was far too easy.  Pause in your random clicking for mere seconds and the game would show you what you needed to find, without you asking it for help.  That said, though, some tasks or locations seemed so obscure that I'm not sure I would have known I could look closer at a particular spot in the room if it hadn't shown me.\n\nI did encounter one bug, where the game refused to respond to my clicking and I thought I'd have to restart, but it was fixed by going to the main menu and then continuing the game.  Other than that, the only issues I encountered were with the clicks picking up objects I wasn't actually clicking on in some cases, which may have something to do with it apparently being a mobile port (I presume, what with it telling you to 'tap here' or to swipe the screen in order to complete a mini game).\n\nI had a few laughs while playing, and especially at the end credits - I'm not sure I would have been happy to pay full price even though it IS cheap, but on sale it's worth a play through.  Just don't expect anything serious and you'll be okay!  :)","August 31, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an older style of graphics, which look rather weak in comparison to what people are used to these days, and the movements were clunky.  I also found that the game would bug randomly and not allow me to do the hidden object puzzles, so I would have to go out to the menu and begin the game agian to make it work.  This was frustrating, but it at least did not hinder my ability to finish the game.   Besides that, the game is short and not terribly well written plot-wise.\n\nThis being said, the mini-games were actually quite entertaining, I liked how the game map was used as opposed to being an add-on, and I liked that the locations were self-contained and you didn't have to run all over the map to find that little key or that random oil can which has no uses until almost the end.  I wouldn't recommend spending a lot of money on this game, but if you're getting it on a discount for under a dollar and you want something to blow an evening on, it isn't the worst game I've played in the genre before.","October 1, 2015","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I finally figured it out about halfway through that it is meant to be hilariously bad -- but it shouldn't have taken me that long to get it.\n\nSo, ignore the voice acting and story, both of which are either bad or hilariously bad.  As a hidden object game, it's okay.  It has two modes: easy mode and advanced mode.  I wish there were a middle one.  In easy mode, if you don't find an object or a location within a few seconds, it will sparkle for you.  So you might as well just mindlessly click wherever is sparkling and you could finish the game with absolutely no brain power on your part at all.  But in advanced mode, sometimes locations were finicky to find, so I spent several minutes just clicking randomly around the screen before giving up and switching to "easy" mode just long enough to get the hint, and then switching back.\n\nI enjoy hidden object games as a mental break.  This one took me about 2 hours to finish.  For the price I paid (a few cents, on sale), it was a fine way to spend an evening.  Recommended if you enjoy the genre and don't have high expectations","December 27, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The amazing world building and dynamic characters are only the beginning, as they only scratch the surface of the actual genius and innovative gameplay.\n\nNow as opposed to todays RPG, shooting and action based this game takes a creative path in making you think deeply about your choices, as you uncover the mystery of what happened to your missing wife. You're always forced to stay focused and look for subtle clues in your enviroment, and the aesthetics just makes the experience a whole lot better.\n\nWhen I first saw this game on steam I was unsure about it's directional capabilities, however I found myself surprised by the sheer level of thought and care taken into crafting such a epic and emotionally investing story that will keep you thinking about it for days on end. I would have to give this game a solid 20/10 and I hope that more people will be able to experience this hidden gem amongst the rocks. -Aru","November 14, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
