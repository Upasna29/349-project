With one of the recent patches/changes the game has been re-balanced for single players so you're not punished for wanted to play alone!\n\n+ A daily quest system that can hold 3 quests! This mean each day a quest will be given, the game will hold 3 for you so you don't have to play every day.\n\n+ Don't like a daily quest because it doesn't fit your play style? Or maybe you just don't wanna do it? Then you can re-roll!\n\n+ The monthly quest system introduces major rewards making them feel they are really worth doing.\n\n+ With how the new item system works alot of gear now introduces abilities and effects to your towers will gives way for more\ninteresting play, frost towers being able to buff the damage of other towers, or having your harpoons explode on each and every target as they pierce the horde of monsters.\n\n+ Many maps and modes to play on, you can hit the hard maps for the godly gear or play the normal maps to relax and just bank up your coins and pets.\n\n+ Did I mention pets?!! You can find eggs during matches and then take them back to the tavern to be hatched! Pets can do multiple things for you from giving you a boost in stats, damaging the monsters you fight to having a an ability that assists you or damages enemies and there are lots of abilities.\n\n+ NO PAY TO WIN  at all Trendy has made it their goal to do this, all micro-transactions are skins for pets,heros and (planned) Tower skins! So towers will look different and have different animations, oh and bags let's talk about bags.\n\n+ Trendy has recently introduced a system where you can now Auto gather to specific bags and auto sort with them to keep your cache of loot neat and tidy! You can also customize your bags icons/names to what you want making organization a breeze.\n\n+ It may not seem like it, but the developers read every scrap of feed back people offer for the game, the forums are incredibly active and the developers do listen and will partake in the forums and chats, sometimes you may even run in to a white named person in a game and play with em!\n\n+ Every week they have a Developer cast on twitch to show case some of the new features, talk to the players, get feed back and improve the game, they will also answer various questions from chat and forums. The developers are really active in the community.\n\n+ Vibrant art style full of colors and awesome effects.\n\nCons every game has em.\n- The loved lobby system is no longer, we can no longer scroll through a list and see a list of players playing what maps and what levels they may be or modes they may be running, you just kinda go in to a tavern and go to the war map and join a game based on map and mode, and if there are others playing it will put you with them, if there isent any then it will create a new game for you.\n\n- No offline single player, this will effect some more then others.\n\n- The RNG in this game is heavy, some times you just want that one item with those beastly tower stats and all that drops is hero skill gear.\n\n-The game is currently in alpha, so bugs and other issues are to be expected as well as changes, this may include wipes or changes to the core of the game, so once you get a feel for the game you can lose everything you thought you knew due to the changes,\n\n-The pet skins the only negative thing about this is the fact you have to buy and apply a skin before knowing what rarity the pet will be so its a gamble and not a very good one.\n\n-There are some Anti Troll mechanics put in to place for the actual game, but while in the tavern they have almost free reign(can always make a private tavern to bypass this though)\n\n-4 classes at this time there are only 4 classes in the game so options can feel limited, however trendy has said they will release more heros(free)\n\n- NPC shop keepers kinda have nothing useful for sale, all the good stuff is out there in the monsters gullets! So get out there and get chopping-\n\n-Pet hatching time is a bit long, as of now it's 8 hours for a single pet to hatch, that's real time, there is talk from the devs that the time may change soon.\n\n- Unlike DD1 the mana is sparse so you have to play more carefully so no more maxing out all dem towers and seeing all the pretty stars.\n\n- The current lack of content you can play on multiple maps on multiple modes which is really fun, but I just wish there was more raw content, I know they are working on it though.\n\nOver All I would recommend this game, please remember this game is in alpha, so if that bothers you then you may wanna wait or go watch some game play on twitch or youtube before you decide, if you're like myself and don't mind a few bumps here and there and get to watch the game grow then jump on it.","September 30, 2015","true","330.6"," 536 of 592 people (91%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","91","536","592","44","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KleineErdbeere/recommended/236110/","KleineErdbeere","Little Strawberry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KleineErdbeere/","490 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n17.10.15 - I'm recommending it now and will replace the review below once it gets out of early access.\n--\nI loved Dungeon Defenders 1, I even loved the nightmare-gear gap that a lot of people struggled with.\nThis is my opinion about DD2 on Day1/2.\n\nDD2, out of the box and eventhough it still is in early access, is a heavily gated experience. It forces you through an abyssmal grind while isolating you from the rest of the player base the higher you go. Personal skill isn't rewarded, but how many times you attempted a mission. You can win a campaign map but it doesn't unlock the next one - something I have never seen before - it's behind a ridiculous mechanic where you have to grind previous maps over and over for XP until the next one unlocks even if you wouldn't have any problems winning the next ones. You can't even attempt harder maps or harder difficulties. I know a fair deal of grinding, but I don't understand why a game won't let you progress even if you conquered all the maps you've previously played. The whole war table thing doesn't make any sense and should be abolished because a system where players are put into tiers is dumb.\n\nA lot of my fun in DD1 was figuring out placements, but it seems it has been completely thrown out of the window here.\nIf you're too strong, the game just downscales all of your stats/towers and always attempts to put you on the verge of barely winning. It's good if you want that sort of challenge, but the game also forces you through this item progression grind. In DD1 you could perfectly well do maps below Nightmare if you knew how to play. You would also believe that finishing on normal would unlock harder difficulties for the map - it doesn't, you have to accumulate a ton of XP until the game decides you're up for 'hard' mode on specific maps. It doesn't make any sense, considering that the game limits your access of maps depending on your level. Most of the times you will not be able to even replay levels in the next tier. So the progression system actually regresses the options you should have available. WHY?\n\nI think this is all an effort to stop people from twinking and powerleveling, because otherwise selling gold or other services isn't going to be profitable in the future if it wasn't obstructed. Which is probably going to be a big deal because even upgrading your gear requires a lot of gold to a point where you waste more gold on a level 1 upgrade than you possibly get from finishing a map. That's completely bonkers. Though there are a few silver linings.\n\nThe PC version is well done, as opposed to DD1 which struggled with a lot of port problems. Eventhough there are a lot of interface options, it's still lacking a way to disable ally health and enable that tower health is always being shown or at least if it's on low health. I like the concept of the chests at the end and that you don't have to complete all waves to still get a reward. Actually between finishing or failing a map there is very little incentive, aside from the possible higher rarity loot at the end and slightly more xp depending on the wave you were. All that matters in the end is that you've attempted it and you get your fair share of a reward. It turns everyone into a winner, behind a heavily grind/gated based mechanic.\n\n\nI can't recommend this to anyone who loved DD1, as it is right now. Wait for it to come out in 1-2 years and hope that they didn't turn this into a game on-par with a mindless cow clicker and with more substance instead. Also be aware that this game can only be played if you are online, it's basically a mmo.","December 5, 2014","false","157.4"," 1,326 of 1,584 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","326","1","0","90"

You'll ruin the game for yourself.\n\nAdvise people interested in the series to start here - buy full package (That means game + DLC) on Steam Sale, Indie Bundle or otherwise where cheapest.\n\nDDE (Dungeon Defenders Eternity - the worst one)\nA rereleased version of DD1 - purported as the 'definitive' version, which is basically a glorified DD2 beta - testing out features of the new engine for the recent DD2 release, I'm not even going to list the features here - they are so insubstantial to what was lost and you just shouldn't bother even considering buying this one.\n\nNo Local Multiplayer.\nNo Steam Workshop.\nAlways (forcibly) online, with god awful connection - just trust me on this one.\nIngame store with microtransactions despite already having paid for the bloody thing.\nThis is the MOBILE PHONE version of the game ported to PC.\n\nWould not recommend to my worst enemy.\n\nDD2 (Dungeon Defenders 2 - What you're actually here for)\nI was incredibly wary of DD2 upon hearing of its release - having read other reviews I made the decision to take the plunge into buying Early Access, here's what I think, take it as you will:\n\n~ Larger emphasis on combat, for better or worse depending on your own personal tastes: each class has had their number of unique skills increased from DD1 from 2 -> 3, however the total types of towers each has fell from 5 -> 4.\n\n+ Combat, thankfully, feels better for the most part.\n+ Animations are more lively than the previous game.\n+ Skill spheres are a pretty cool concept.\n+ Microtransactions ingame grant no play bonuses to those that pay for them (ergo: no pay-to-win), and Trendy have made the promise to keep to this.\n\n- ...But damn, ingame purchases are expensive: for a single Monk Ninja costume it will cost you 1200 gems - the equivalent of $12.\n- Characters are normalized across the board: no colour customization at the time of writing and the game has lost the RPG character development in favour of gear being the sole provider of stat boosts, along with Skill Spheres, which, depending on the size can increase stats by variable amounts or completely change the way a facet of your character works (such as a tower's mode of fire) though there aren't many of these at the time of writing either.\n- Characters feel somewhat imbalanced - Monk and Huntress have great synergy together (for those who have/n't played: Geyser Traps and Electric Aura can stun & damage for days) which writes off the viability of the Squire (my class) and the Apprentice - which is a shame because while tower synergy is really cool, the current designs indicate little synergy outside of the Monk-Huntress combo I mentioned - making them more popular for people who know of it.\n- Maps can feel claustrophobic compared to the previous game (we're only counting DD1 as a comparative: screw DDE).\n- It's always online - you can host a Private Game and play by yourself, but good luck: this game was NOT meant for soloing, and is significantly harder to do so alone, considering prior shady practices of Trendy in and outside of DD (look them up, and need I mention DDE again), it's worrying that once this game - as an MMO - gets out of Early Access, they may simply drop it if the money isn't good enough anymore, meaning people who have invested into the game will flat out no longer be able to play it (which is my biggest overall apprehension - but it can't really be avoided).\n\nFinal Thoughts\nAs surprising as it was, despite my skepticism I still really enjoyed (and am currently enjoying) my time playing DD2, and was impressed for what it offered, being pre-alpha.\n\nDo buy if you:\n\nAre crazy for another blast of Dungeon Defending goodness.\nHave tried it elsewhere and like it and can see yourself playing it in future (It's good value for money!).\nOr alternatively you're one of many Steam-goers who just likes wasting money on games they'll never likely play.\n\nDon't buy if you:\n\nHave never played DD1: try that first and THEN consider this game.\nDidn't like DD1 - at the time of writing it still currently stands as the best of the  three  two Dungeon Defenders games.\nFelt that stat allocation and creation of character builds was vital to your enjoyment of DD1 - as an MMO this game currently just doesn't boast the allowance for such individuality and feels homogenized as a result.\nAre on the fence on the matter - you can always wait rather than waste your student loan on an eventual F2P MMO.\nDon't have enough money in your Bank Account/Steam Wallet/Steam Point Card because Steam will refuse to let you purchase a game you can't afford and you'll just look like an idiot.\n\nAll in all, I actually really enjoyed myself, and got the Collector's Edition on top of that to show my support: don't let me down Trendy.\n\nEdit: Steam completely destroyed my formatting for some reason.\n\nMost recent Edit: ♥♥♥♥ dis grame","May 2, 2015","true","19.9"," 219 of 256 people (86%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","86","219","256","35","10"

I'm impressed. I just hope you'll take some of this to heart.\n\nTL;DR at the bottom.\n\nIt is a good game, right now a downgrade from DD1 sure, but a good game still.  I'd like nothing more than to change my review to a positive one, but It has some concerning flaws that makes me want to discourage the purchase of any dlc/gems until they are fixed though, especially since Trendy seems more intent on making more skins rather than adding content or fixing bugs. The game is still in alpha with alpha amounts of content, and its making me kinda nervous when Trendy is saying they're planning on releasing the game this year.\n\nThey are as follows:\n\nLoot and loot customization/upgrading is completely shallow compared to DD1. Items have class specific traits though that make 99% of the loot you find without said stats useless, making it harder (read: not in a good way) to progress. In dd1 you could just grab near any piece of decent loot and upgrade the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. All gear say for some legendaries are now trash. There's no real achievement to getting legendary pets either, considering a single onslaught run up to 15 gets me on average at least one.\nGetting good loot used to be such a rush...\n\nUpgrading your loot nets you about one items worth of the single stat you want, whereas in DD1, depending on how much mana you had and the upgrade levels, the benefits could be massive. This makes upgrading to get a grand total of 300 tower health split across all your items such a letdown.\n\n\nThe game has general lag and disconnecting issues for many players, even while playing singleplayer(!).\n\nThe game runs over 60 fps, mostly, but never 144 fps, even on my gtx 970 and i7-4770k... And suffers frequent fps drops in certain areas, like the tavern. For a game on the Unreal engine it should run better.\n\nThere are few maps, most of which not really that interesting, and no fun challenges like in the previous game (incursion is just more mobs and minibosses, onslaught is near pointless to do for anything other than golden egg farming). This, combined with the loot problems doesn't exactly encourage the progression into the higher nightmares.\n\nExperience gain is really weird. Out of the gamemodes and all the difficulties, the most efficient way to earn exp as of the time of writing is to just repeat liferoot freeplay hard over and over. Nightmare 1 dragonfall gives you about 100k exp, while liferoot hard gives you 180k.\n\nNo trading (yet?) and no playershops. This was a really big part of the previous game for me and many of my friends who enjoyed DD1. Customizing your very own tavern with your items and having your achievements on display was a really neat feature.\n\nThey keep using the words "Play [the hero] your way" in the devstreams, but in reality, there's only the four builds (dps, towerdps, waller and hybrid), and mostly just the same way of beating levels with the same ways of placing turrets.\n\nTrendy is adding more heroes as their first priority (according to what I hear on the devstream) and I think it is the wrong way around, they need to add more stuff to do with those heroes rather than the heroes themselves. Otherwise it just feels like doing the same over and over only barely different.\n\nThe reason I list this bunch of cons and not recommending the game is because I have a blind hope that trendy can fix their game and make it live up to its grand potential. I'll thumb this review up in an instant if Trendy ever decides to fix some of these issues.\n\nTL;DR\nThis game is good, it is a dungeon defenders game, but everything it has from DD1, it has less of.","February 8","false","293.7"," 138 of 184 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","138","184","6","13"

I will try to save you some frustrationg, disappointment and money in the process. This is a copy/paste from my post at the official forums here: https://dungeondefenders.com/2/topic/131203/ with a few edits so that it makes more sense as a review. Hope it does not get deleted from the forums so you can always refer to it.\n\nNote that this is not a negative review because of bugs or early access status etc. This is due to design choices and the direction the game is taking.\n\nDungeon Defenders II or "Farming players for cash." or "How you go from a great game, to a mediocre one in order to increase revenue". Take your pick.\n\nEverything that is wrong with this game is everything that differentiates it from Dungeon Defenders 1.\n\nMeaning:\n\na)The Hero Deck. It is awful, restricting, makes it impossible to solo high difficulty if you need to do so, makes you go in and out on multiplayer as people join up who have what you need but..not in their deck. Hey we all left our purge monks out of the deck. The moment you decide to bring your monk, no one has whatever else is missing...\n\nb) The match creation/joining system. Old DD1 was just great. The current one is a mess.\n\nc) No bank, selling inventory space and generating content that clutters inventory space. Consumables are now in the game, yeah!! NOT.\n\nd) Loot went from huge amounts or interesting loot, item sets, etc (DD1) to loot that only allow cookie cutter builds (forget hybrids folks).\n\ne) Tedious monthlies. Seriously 50 pet affection levels? 600 waves? Leveling pets you don't need on maps that generate loot that you don't need. Yeah!! You're a casual gamer? Have a job? Family? Tough luck buddy.\n\nf) Timers on eggs. What for? Inventory clutter. Buy bags, buy gems.\n\ng) Did I mention separate pet inventory? Buy more bags and gems.\n\ne) Overpriced skins/models, yeah! 4800 gems to show your support and buy a new character model. Wait, I already showed my support with the collector's edition and the awakened pack. You obviously need even more support. Yet because I missed the "promotion" (which also required buying!) I can't be recognized as a DD1 veteran. Shows how much you support me, the player that's been loyal to you and already supported you with lots of money although they smelled the direction this was going for. I didn't want the gems that came with the promotion, I only wanted the title. It's the first game ever that I see requiring a payment for giving you a title recognizing you as a veteran from the previous game (and I collect games for over 25 years--1035 games 872 DLCs owned currently on Steam alone). Every game out there that offers such title, all they require is you owning the previous title (which of course I own, with all available DLCs). And I own 2 of copies with all the DLCs, not one. Because I played it with my other half.\n\nf) Overpriced skins for pets that you gamble your money on. Yes, I can't even buy the skin I like and apply it to the pet I farmed for. I have to buy/spend gems to transform eggs to get random quality that may or may not have the elemental damage I want. Ad infinitum.\n\ng) Here comes the carnival event. Offering a wheel that drops up to 700ipwr legendaries (at least not like the useless shops that cap at 550) with bad combinations of stats and..inventory clutter. Masks(see head skins) that you don't even get to keep, they're consumable and serve as inventory clutter. Either you use them up immediately/sell them or if you want to save them, buy even more gems/bags. While the good part of the event requires..gems again!\n\nh) We now know there will be many more heroes coming up! Heroes that you have to buy space for. And skins for. With.. gems! The perpetual carrot. You wanted a MOBA element to this game exactly for this reason, the community of old DD1 players said no and you backed off, yet you kept the MOBA carrot in the game, new heros every other week, new skins for the new heroes, new things to buy gems for. Ad infinitum. Yet, the existing heroes have useless towers, bad combinations and there are only cookie-cutter builds viable. But sure, lets get more heroes because strategy and tower defense is not the point. The point is having new heroes and new skins every month so we have something to spend gems on.\n\nI could go on. And I'm sorry for the sarcastic tone in my post but I feel that this way it gets the message across much better. We played DD1 because it was a fun game of tower defense with FPS elements that required strategy as well. This game is turning into the mindless perpetual money making machine that defines games like League of Legends etc. I have already deeply regretted that I supported this title but obviously the romantic in me, smothered the cynical critic and hoped that it would not go this way after all.\n\nI have already paid a lot for DD2, but from now on I will not spend another cent on it UNLESS it changes business model, or at least adds a SINGULAR pay-once-for-everything option and addresses the real issues with the game instead of creating perpetual carrots. Fix all existing heroes so that they all have viable tools with synergies with each other and provide content updates in terms of new maps etc that require strategy instead of things that constantly require gems or indirectly just cause an influx of revenue.\n\nEVERYTHING that was fun in DD1 is missing from DD2 or has turned into something that generates revenue.\n\nThis report/review will go up on steam as well as my negative review, addressed to the players of DD1 that may have not yet experienced this, in order to perhaps save them from the frustration and disappointment that I personally experienced.","February 9","false","318.1"," 80 of 98 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","80","98","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ragingmuffin/recommended/236110/","ragingmuffin","StormGust2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ragingmuffin/","395 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs of early access. I have to give this one a thumbsdown and here's why.\n\nFirst of all the positive:\n\nGraphics - Game looks a lot better than the previous in my opinion. It  doesn't look blocky, It looks smooth. Lighting's quite impressive and it is also colourful which is what I like about the game. Not to mention they actually manage to put a little bit of realness(if that's a word) to it by making trees sway, leaves on trees move and grass and other plantation have animation as well.\n\nItems - The item actually looks better in terms of quality. Like my squire for example I have a common, epic and mythical sword. By looking at the three the higher the quality the better than look of the weapon, I mean I played DD1 and a lot of the time, I prefer the looks of my supreme quality items than my ultimate quality ones which doesn't make sense since you want to make the better quality to look more epic, right?\n\nCharacter specs- Ok I like this on my squire since It got specwhere it would make my barricade have a chance to stun enemies after hitting and knocking them back which is good for a defensive structure.\n\n\nNow heres the bad part:\n\nCharacter specs- Even though I said good things about character specs, The fact of the matter is that, there's not many of them and some of them are just outright useless like the "powerful spears" on my squire. 18 im at lvl 13 with 18 spec points and If i use it on "shiny spikes" which makes my barricades stun, It gets a 47.62% chance to stun while If I use 18 specs points on powerful spears, I would give me 3% chance for my ballistas to do penetration do full dmg which is sooo low considering there's no stats to add when you level up to get more defense speed, these are all items based now. Im guessing to prevent people from using cheat engine like DD1 but that is just bad.\n\nStructure's Stats - Ok There's no way to increase your structure's range other than upgrade....Yep..you heard it right. Ok how does this affect the game you might ask? Considering that there's barely any green crystals(currency to build turrets and stuff) you are pretty much stuck with at most time tier 1 or tier 2 upgrade and not to mention that YOU HAVE TO PROTECT them for a round because 100% of time at my level, it gets destroyed because at the first round you get 230 crystals so for example i put in a ballista which cost 50crystals and upgrade it to tier 1 for another 50 crystal and tier 2 to make it decent cost 100 crystals and the best at my level is tier 3 which is 150 crystals. Now as you can see, at 1st round you can only go up to tier 2 and that is only ONE structure while the maps have several of these paths where enemies will spawn! so you are forced to almost not upgrade any of your structures at 1st round because you will NEED barricades to at least slow enemies down and 60% of the time, they get destroyed because of the fact that theres about 4 enemies on my level that would far outrange all my structures including the ballista which makes structures almost useless at my level. Firebomb chucking enemies, Dragon that fire fireballs from its mouth, spear throwers and flying dragons all outrange any structures from any classes that is IF you do not upgrade which is more likely what you are going to do because green crystals are soo limited. What the hell?\n\nSort Button - No sort button considering you can easily get full inventory quite quickly unless of course you got the gold to buy more inventory spaces.\n\nItem/Stat Downscale - You get downgraded when you try and do low level maps which is just bad because grinding is much more tedious now considering the game is based on grinding for items and most of the time you get sweet\n(F word) all.\n\nI just don't like the way DD have changed from its previous predecessor. It feels more forced into you like you are forced to grind for level to unlock the next skill or map. The range enemies need nerfing and what the hell is up with the ogre? It can one hit kill my barricades with 8k hp (either this is a bug or intended I do not know). There is not much variety in terms of classes. You still have your base classes with almost the same structures as in DD1. The only good thing is your character's skills, it's more useful now and is actually needed in order to win the game such as the earthquake attk that stuns AoE for squire. However,  I really think they need to improve on this, I know it's only early access but I cannot recommend it at the moment in its current state. Wait for it till it goes free to play.\n\nEdit: Edited Structure Stats","December 6, 2014","false","14.6"," 408 of 600 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","408","600","3","26"

Part of me loves this game and wants it to succeed so very much, and part of me is very bitter at the moment.\n\nI'll try my best to explain why, and you can make the call based on that, whether or not it's worth your time.\n\nLeveling, and getting to max level is not bad at all and in fact if that's all you intend to do, I say play it, you have nothing to lose really and things are quite fun especially if you have multiple friends to play with. The art is well done, the gameplay is quite smooth and it's a fun casual relaxed experience which I think anyone can enjoy really.\n\nHere's where it starts to get gritty, and you'll either hate it or love it for the most part. Once you're maxed level, and you want to start to improve your gear, there's really not much left to be desired. You'll play the same maps you were playing, only with higher HP monsters and higher damage. And you'll not see any variation from that at all. Allow me to reiterate:\n\nOnslaught, previously Survival in Dungeon Defenders, is ♥♥♥♥. Literally. I'm not going to sugar coat it, it's a big steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥. Literally the only reason people run it, is on a super low difficulty, so they can farm gold. Rewards suck. The time it takes to do sucks. Nothing special about it at all. Don't even waste your time, IMO.\n\nIncursion, a slightly different variation from maps, but really nothing different other than throwing mass quantities of mobs at you in each lane. Yeah I guess it's harder but it really doesn't bring anything new to the table. Nothing new, just more mobs, more HP and more damage. Sounds so fun right?\n\nNightmare 1-4 is my gripe with the game, I suppose. In DD1, we had one nightmare mode and that was it. This game tried to change that and it's pretty much fell flat on its face. There is no difference between Nightmare 1-4 outside of damage numbers. So much engaging gameplay. So you farm the same enemies while you're leveling, to continue farming the same enemies through nightmare 1-4 only scaled higher. Absolutely nothing different, you'll run the same maps until your eyes bleed, and then more.\n\nPets are bland. Seriously if you played DD1, you're going to be very disappointed here. Liked that mega chicken and it's badass DPS from DD1? Well sorry to say you're going to laugh when you see the pets here.\n\nOverall, this game lacks the fun that Dungeon Defenders 1 had in all aspects. No goofy weapons, no goofy pets, nothing fun at all. Defense speed and range are not a thing here, and I hope you like watching a tower fire slow as hell. Gear is boring in every since of the word, and you'll see what I mean if you play this in comparison to DD1. The same stats, and you'll be looking for 1% upgrades which is laughable to me.\n\nDon't even get me started on the ♥♥♥♥ they've pulled with the latest update they had in which they threw a carnival at us when the game has been needing core changes for months, and what do we get along with it? A 40$ costume that's a reskin. Yes, you read that right. A frickin costume that's 40 bucks. I believe in supporting a game if you enjoy it, but they seriously overstepped their bounds on this. Every patch seems to roll out costume after costume and core gameplay changes that need to be made, have yet to make it into the game.\n\nTake a look at steamcharts and you can see what I mean.\n\n\nTL;DR: If you enjoy casual relaxed play and just shooting the ♥♥♥♥ with friends and trying out a tower defense game to level to max level and not expect much more than that, check it out.\n\nIf you want fun, laughs, and was hoping to see a sequal to the dungeon defenders name, and are expecting a hell of a fun time, avoid it.\n\nMy two cents, take it or leave it. Obviously I can't cover every major gripe/perk of the game, and if you want a good view on what players think, check the forums out for yourself and you'll get an idea for how negative they are, especially after last patch.\n\nObviously I want better changes to come, and I hope they do, I'd really like to recommend this game, but sadly in its current state, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","February 17","false","774.2"," 68 of 85 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","68","85","2","0"

I follow the game and look forward to when it is complete.

It doesn't even look like DD1."\n\nThis is Dungeon Defenders. If you want  to play a sequel of games that are all the same, buy Call of Duty. They are right about one thing though, this isn't like DD1 but this is a good thing! This is only and pre-alpha and the work they did with it is just amazing.\n\nThe graphics are amazing: just look at all the colour in the artstyle. Got to admit, not like the first Dungeon Defender which was, in my opinion, a bit low on graphic quality.\n\nLook at all the content!! So much new stuff in there! The new pet system, the costume system and much more.\n\nIn only one patch, they doubled the fun I had the first time I played Dungeon Defenders 2.

Don't buy this game expecting a fully developped game, it is a work in progress (which progresses like crazy!).\n\nI played over 500+ hours of Dungeon Defenders 1 on console and I am really satisfied with the sequel. I digged the first one and liked even more the second one. This is the kind of game that you can't get enough of.\n\nThe only thing that scares me is the idea to go free to play. What will happen to the community? Will it get ruined? Will it be even better?

From the leveling to the gear to the social interaction.\n\nLeveling:\n\n-In DD1, leveling always was fun, at any time, you could pick which map you felt you were strong enough for, and you     were rewarded for completing more challenging maps.\n-In DD2, it doesn't matter which map you choose, it is much faster to just play the quickest (hard difficulty) map possible, and keep repeating the process. The difficulty is trivial at best, and it just feels like a chore.\n\nLoot:\n-In DD1, loot is very diverse when it comes to the stats on the items that are dropped. There is a continuous search on any map for those rare pieces of gear with the perfect stats for your character. Many times, there are pieces with negative stats, because other stats on the gear are over leveled, and it is up the player to decide if the loss in some stats, is worth the gain in others. This makes you want to see how far you can push yourself in each wave to find the most overleveled piece of gear possible, even if it means sacrificing all of your character health and damage, for a full tower stat item.\n-In DD2, all loot feels linear. You progress through the maps which have an indicator of what item level of loot will drop. You run the map and get gear that is slightly better than the previous map. You repeat the process, slowly getting better, but never standing out for pushing yourself. You never feel the need to push yourself.\n\nSocial Interaction/trading:\n\n-In DD1, you get your own tavern, where you can place items on the floor of your shop, or in your personal shop. In your personal shop, you set prices on any items you wish to sell for mana(currency). Players tend to place the best items on the floor, in an attempt to barter with players that join their shop. It really makes you feel like you are selling something that has meaning, because items can have very unique stats. This makes the player WANT to go do more tougher and tougher maps to improve their shop. Having a personal tavern is one of the best aspects of the whole game, you can spend hours just setting your shop up the way you want it, and chat with customers who enter.\n-In DD2, trading is non-existent. You get a personal tavern, but can't sell or trade.\n\nPlease Trendy, randomize stats on loot based on map difficulty instead of just increasing the gear by a percentage. Give us taverns that we can sell our items that we work for, and let us level up the way we want to, with more experience based on how tough the map and difficulty is.","February 8","false","33.1"," 89 of 120 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","89","120","2","10"

Fans of the first game which is also good should enjoy this, and newcomers should as well.  Fans of Dungeon Defenders Eternity, well...we don't talk about that one, but you should enjoy this too.\n\nCurrently there are 4 characters.  The monk, the squire, the apprentice, and my personal favorite, the huntress.  Each one has 3 different abilities (with the 4th always being a heal) and 4 different kinds of towers/defenses.  Use these to fend off waves of monsters and bosses who follow paths to try and destroy whatever it is you're defending.  As you play, you will get all kinds of loot drops.  Armor pieces, weapons, and eggs which can be hatched into a bunch of different kinds of pets.  There are quite a few maps, as well as higher difficulties and some different modes to play.  As you level up, you can also unlock special slots that you can place various passive buffs in.\n\nYou can play solo, with 3 randoms, or a private lobby with friends.  You'll all be gathered into a cool little player HUB area before you start, where there are all kinds of things you can do.\n\nI do believe however that you need an internet connection to play, so keep that in mind.  If that bothers you, stick with the first game or wait until this one is released and goes F2P.\n\nLots of fun, definitely worth checking out.","August 5, 2015","true","27.9"," 63 of 79 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","63","79","7","5"

It just needs content, changes and some fixes here and there. It runs surprisingly well for a game that’s in pre-alpha. I did glitch through the map once, but I have yet to find another bug.\n\nAt the moment it has only 10 maps that all feel unique and rich in detail, and difficulty selection is just like it was in the original. Monster variety is given but there are some monsters that have a higher range than your towers, and since you cant increase your tower range with stats anymore its pretty difficult to counter them. Also there are new monsters immune to physical damange, so squires are not OP anymore, as they were in the original. There are only 4 classes at the moment, with 4 towers and 4 spells each, and the max level cap at 25. Sadly, the game is quite difficult if you play it solo and it even gives you a disadvantage in the rarity of dropped loot. If you play with a group it’s much easier overall, and you get better loot for every additional group member (up to 4), so it seems to be clearly intended for co-op play.\n\nNew:\n\n- Combining different elements to get bonus exp/gold is a nice addition to Dungeon Defenders, as it lets you experiment with the different tower elements (water + lightning, knockup + ice, etc).\n- There are sub-cores that can now be destroyed without ending the entire round. However, if you let them get destroyed, new enemy paths will open up and you’ll have to build additonal defenses.\n- The cores are now unique level based objects that fit nicely with the surrounding map (doors, portals, generators).\n- New manually activated traps which do damage in an area, and can only be used again after a cooldown (Gas, Fire, Water).\n- Upgrading towers now shows visual changes, which is awesome.\n- There are now 2 kinds of mana, which I think is a good thing. (blue for spells and green for towers).\n- Items can gain levels by fusing other items into them, which will also reward you with skill points that you can spend on the tower/hero stats on those items.\n\nThe graphics seem very minimalistic at first look, but upon closer inspection they are quite detailed close up, a clear and improvement over Dungeon Defenders 1. I personally enjoy the changes, but other fans might be put off. The new tavern looks fantastic and I can't wait to find out what they’ll add in later, as the game is currently in early access.\n\nAll in all it’s a solid tower defense game as it is right now and you can have some fun with your friends for sure, but keep in mind that it will be Free to Play on release,  so you might want to wait untill then.\n\nThe devs have claimed that the microtransactions will be purely cosmetic (costumes, tower skins, and tavern decorations ), but we’ll see if they can keep that promise. It’s sounds promising but other devs have changed their minds down the road. (Loadout, for example)\n\nThere you have it, my first impressions. I will update this review if I encounter anything notable and as I play newer Early Access builds.\n\nThanks for reading :)","December 8, 2014","true","168.5"," 108 of 152 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","108","152","0","15"

Guess the reason is that the developers always work on this game to improve it. Dungeon Defenders was released in the year 2011. The second part can not be compared to DD. Duneon Defenders II with new 3D animations is the next step with lot`s of improvements. This game belong to the tower defense game genre. The second pre-alpha update include some new game types ( campaign, free play ) like incursion, onslaught, end game, end game incursion and end game onslought. The difficult level has added ( easy, normal, hard ) four new nightmare levels. The match type Quick match is for multiplayer co-op and Private for invited friends only. New pets are available now in epic, mystic and legendary. For all of us who expect more, we can power up and increase our pet`s affection level in order to evolve. It`s necessary to use Shellium shards for evolve. To receive shellium shard let the founded eggs in your inventory about 48 hours. The first pre-alpha offered medium challenge, now with the second alpha it`s more challenge. From easy to hard difficult it`s possible to play single too, but on nightmare it`s obligated to play in a team. The currency in this game are crystals and wyfern tokens. The crystals are included in pre-alpha and the wyfern tokens can be earned in daily and monthly missions. With the crystals for example we can buy more inventory bags, new character slots or discover accessories. For all Uber Speres and lockbox master key it`s possible to pay with wyfern tokens. The balance of this game is good. From the  fondly social and private tavern we can choose challenge on the war table. Bug report is possible too at the tavern keeper. There are some different Shops in this game. The Gran`Masta ( Skill Sphere ) support improvements for hero skills and defense improvements. The Alchemist can improve your items ( clothes, relics and weapons ), simply put all stuff you don`t need inside around your good item and improve your `better choosen item`. The Hatchery for pets can be found at stable boy. For feed your pets go to the Keeper. The Seamstress offers assessories and on the Relic Hunter shop we can buy relics.

I think well over 100 hours is perfectly fine for a game such as this one. Overall, I'd say my past 2 days roughly have not been very enjoyed. Honestly, this is a loot based game, and all loot based games generally boil down to the same point. Gear. This games content can run you about 200hrs for the highest difficulty. I had no friends to really play with, and I spent quite a bit of time dicking around. I got there about 125-150hrs if that, the other 50ish was spent again. Messing around, or playing with randoms.\n\nPeople can tell you that you have to play 1000hrs for a game such as this one, and its clearly not the case. I've played other games, that are more complex and they do not even take that long to understand, or even get to the highest difficulty. That being said, it takes about 100hrs, if you're actually 100% focused on getting to the highest difficulty, and maybe 10-25 depending on your luck to get the gear you need. This includes leveling every character. It just doesn't take that long as people seem to think it does.\n\nThis is a pretty sweet game, ESPECIALLY for an ALPHA.. Man, it blew my mind on terms of how well optimized this game is, honestly I think games released sometimes are thrown out in alpha states.. Anyways. on with the Pros.\n\nPROS\n\n- Decent combat\n\n- Lots of variety in ways to play, and extremely customizable builds.\n\n- Well balanced between the characters, none of them really feel Overpowered (trust me, thats a +)\n\n- Nice pet system (actually pretty customizable too)\n\n- A tack to add on to variety in ways to play, You could honestly play strategy or go play it without any strategy in mind.\n\n- Music, its actually really nice. (Although, I think the most recent patch got me looking for positives to this game, and I can't believe I didn't notice how amazing the music was at times)\n\n- The few cutscenes in games were pretty nice, and slightly entertaining\n\n- Developers seem to listen, and quite fast. They seem to take action on it too.\n\n- Visually, this game looks pretty nice. I know some people will beg to differ on that, but I think this game has a nice     style, it doesn't look bad at all. I think it fits the game perfectly.\n\n- Harbinger boss fight is actually quite good, and not as stale as the other one they released. Giant thumbs up for that one.\n\n\nCONS\n\n- Gear/loot system is terrible now for certain builds, that are unattainable and didn't deserve to get nerfed. Everyone is about average like said in the pros.\n\n- Builds are tedious, and take more "perfection" (enter bad cell quote here) "This isn't even my perfect form" Although, this isn't really a con since more gear is "perfect".\n\n- Although not a bad for some people. This game is definitely a time soak. (Although still a time soak after recent patches, its a lot better than it was, guessing time frame would be 100 hours to get to final NM4 content if you're not as lucky as me)\n\n- Does have minor bugs (they get ironed out pretty quickly generally. Its an alpha lol)\n\n- Overall currency gaining in game, is horrible right now due to lack of drops, and drops being your money maker, even the trashy drops had use.\n\n- Definitely a game to play with friends, its a nice game but like most. It is definitely a lot better with friends.\n\n- Feels like uber spheres are generally useless, or not really any better than the original skill/tower if not weaker. Some Ubers are useful, just some are down right awful, and even questionable how it got through, and still hasn't been messed with.\n\nIts a good game, I just cannot recommend it at the moment. I honestly love this game, and I enjoyed it 170 hours. The farming isn't that bad anymore, still a bit of a time soak really not that much compared to other mmo-like games. Much better with friends and casual play in my opinion. Sorry for the long review. The game has been getting updates to fix the problems I had, but I feel as the damage is done, hopefully others can enjoy it. Its not a bad game, but I'm not going to reccommend it.","December 16, 2015","false","209.6"," 102 of 144 people (71%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","71","102","144","9","5"

The devs did a good job making this game similar enough to the first one, but added enough originality to call it a brand new game. This is NOT just a retexture of the first one, but so much more, there are now sub cores that if destroyed open a new spawn point for enemies, ability spheres, several levels, and much more. Also, unlike most other early-access games the devs are CONSTANTLY updating, the more you sign in and play the game, the more points you earn to vote on what they add into the game. These people truly care for their players.\n\nPro's:\n- Better looking (Graphics, animations, enemys, tavern)\n- Tons more levels, items, and pets.\n- New types of equiptable items including vanity items.\n- New enemies and boss fights.\n- Item leveling requires other items to be enchanted into it, instead of just paying with gems.\n- Seperate tower gems and ability gems\n- I could freakin' go on forever haha\n\nCon's:\n- ONLINE ONLY; This is one thing I don't really like, since a lot of times my internet is down or just bugging out, but there is a private lobby mode, and as long as you have a feint connection to the internet, you should be good.\n- The menu is somwhat complicated and progression is unclear, it's hard to tell what missions you have done on what difficulty, and which one you are supposed to do next.\n\nI was a huge fan of DD1 and I am really really exited for the release of DD2 when everything is finished up.","December 23, 2014","true","65.5"," 84 of 120 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","84","120","7","7"

I first tested DD2 very, very early on, before it was redone to be much closer to its predecessors, Dungeon Defenders, and Dungeon Defenders Eternity. Team Trendy was still deciding on the direction they wanted to go with the project. At the time it was PvP, and I for one am extremely happy that they went back to the tried and true formula that makes the series great. After trying the game again, post-redesign, I bought into the Defense Council, and it's not often that I feel thrilled to have paid $70 for a game. Here are the things this game does SO right:\n\nDungeon Defenders at its finest:\n\nDD2, even still in alpha, trumps the first 2 games already. The tavern is bigger, better, and packed with things to unlock and discover as you play. The game features quests, NPC's, mad amounts of loot and items, a solid campaign, and once beyond that, multiple new game modes to dive into. For an Early Access title, there is a tremendous amount of content here already, with more updates pouring in every 6 weeks or so. I do look forward to plenty more maps coming in in the future, those are pretty limited currently, but not so much so that you get bored.\n\nTrendy!\n\nTrendy Entertainment, once again, shines in their interactions with the community, in addressing bugs and issues, and in building a great experience. These guys GET IT. I mean REALLY get it, when it comes to how to treat the community, and even in alpha they're right on top of things. You'll see them reply to nearly every thread, and for a game with around 14,000 concurrent users at the time of writing this, that's impressive to say the least. They've gone above and beyond the call, even compensating the community when issues arise which reset quests or cause the players to lose progress. This is an alpha, we will ALL lose progress at times, but these guys still know how frustrating that can be!\n\nImmersion\n\nOne of the big surprises for me in DD2 was getting into the campaign and seeing more than just the same crystals to defend. There are interactive traps on the map, and other things to defend besides just the main crystal. In one case, there were even NPC's on the map, cowering up near the throne while you defended them and kept them alive. Tel ya what, having actual characters there made it feel so much more worthwhile! Who wants to defend an empty throne? I love the added depth they've brought to DD2, it brings so much life to the game!\n\nF2P done RIGHT!\n\nTrendy has done a perfect job with the cash shop. There is absolutely nothing pay to win in DD2, and never will be. It's a promise they made, and have stuck to like glue. You can buy costumes, bags, things like that, but never boosts, or anything that changes the way the game is played. You can't go to the cash shop and make your game any easier, or make it impact the experience. You can sure look great though! The costumes for each character are quite cool, and worth a spend for people looking to support the development of the game.\n\nAdditionally, even with an already bustling community, I LOVE the option for private taverns/friends only gameplay. Let's face it, most people don't want to play with "that guy", who presses ready before the towers are even placed, or who afk's mid battle. There are plenty of players around, and getting into a public tavern/game is definitely easy to do, but if you want to chill alone or with the best friend, being able to do that is a huge plus for me. The game has taken the best of what makes a free to play game fun, and added in the way to play the way you want to play.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nPro's:\n\n-The game is already head and shoulders above previous games in the series\n-The development team is ROCKING this!\n-The game has depth, immersion, and a ton of fun, even for an alpha release\n-It's Free to play done beautifully right\n\nCons:\n\n-It is an alpha, so you are going to find the hiccups and bugs that come along with an Early Access game\n-Maps are still limited this early on, but there are enough to keep you going for hours even now","October 17, 2015","true","56.7"," 82 of 117 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","82","117","6","6"

Like a decently functional upgrading system for your items. A pet system. Alot more synergy between classes and the ability to have 4 heroes in your deck and alot more out of your deck.\n\nThere's still alot of things wrong with the game.\nOne frustrating bug i encountered was said to have been around for over a year with nothing done to adress it.\nBut these are bugs and even if Trendy works slowly, they will be resolved and i am ALOT more confident in saying today, that i am happy with what Trendy has done with DD2 over the last year. Alot of strong updates to the game and i'm looking forward to seeing the full package.\n\nNot recommending because its still in alpha/beta (whatever its called these day) and bugs are a frequent thing. If you love the game you should wait untill its full release, when bugs wont frustrate you into abandoning the game.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW - OLD REVIEW\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOh how i loved DD1..\n\nFor me the only similarities, between this game and the original one are the graphical themes, the characters and enemies.\nThe rest was apparently destroyed by Trendy and the Defense Council. Max 3 classes in a 4 class game? No thanks.\nLeveling down heroes? No thanks.\nClasses having synergy with only 1 other class, forces players to sit endlessly searching for multiplayer games, with a correct setup, though a system that tries to find sessions for you, but does utterly nothing to look for class balance at all.\nSo try try again, and hope it finds a good session... No thanks Trendy.\n\nThe lack of choices in this game makes me flee, but above all else, the utterly stupidly abysmal item upgrade system, realy just... No.\n\nI'm gonna go cry that this game turned out to be only a but a shadow of its predecessor.","April 24, 2015","false","159.7"," 438 of 704 people (62%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","62","438","704","29","26"

( though obviously a full geared level 25 that is downscaled will still be a bit stronger than a normal level 1 ).\n\nDownsides:\n- Only 4 classes, this is mainly due to the game being in early access so I will remove this one eventually but for now it feels lacking even though they are working hard on it.\n- Some towers are completely useless while others are a must.  This is also a temporary thing with balance patches coming in the future but I had to throw it down since at the current state some towers are just vastly superior to others.\n\nThere might have been some things that I missed out on but all in all I greatly enjoyed playing the game and will check back with every big patch , on that note a big patch is coming again soon so those kinda waiting with buying it should totally get it when the patch comes out.\n\nedit:  removed the lack of endless survival mode from downsides since it was recently added.\nThis game is being updated a lot and I still have high hopes for the future.","February 2, 2015","true","383.7"," 66 of 94 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","66","94","6","0"

Overal decent to look at for once, very colourful!\n\nAudio: The audio is actually suprisingly good, cute cat meows, funny slashing with monsters growing, cool weapon swooshing and bangs with some really really relaxing old style music that draws you in!\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is pretty simple! Seriosuly the character controls and the way you move is so smooth and easy, you master the game in seconds and cannot complain!\nIt is basically a tower defense with a mixed in RPG (XP, stats, money, armour etc) so you earn coins and ranks, with armour offering certain things to make you better, you get pets which are awesome from eggs to hatch into some more support... It feels like Fable meets Diablo too me which is pretty decent to me (Even though I do not like Diablo) but this game really you work at it, play with friends, form defences and fight to survive against monsters.\nIt also feels a lot like "Orcs Must Die" which is another amazing game but this game feels more refined and balanced correctly!\n\nToo date I am playing at early access alpha, so I am unsure if there will be any character wipes! Too which I hope there best not because I am spending over 8hours waiting for an egg to hatch for a pet to hopefully gain a legendary or mystic!!!\n\nYou can also have multiple characters to create the perfect setup on maps, example I have one character which is soul Hero DPS which I use to kill the bots, I swap to my tower dps to build which is tower power so it holds my damage, once built I swap again to another character to buff my towers health and DPS and finally I swap again to another just to deal damage before hitting my turrets... Once the build is setup I change back to my main hero damage, press ready and fight. The hand has a very in depth tactical edge which you can dive into and tank the game alone.\nThis I prefer to play on all fields to hold the best edge at all times. (You cannot swap while a combat phase, only during build phases)\nThe armour you obtain is important to what build you would like to have for that character so it's best to pay attention to what you are doing when trying for the right strategy.\n\nA draw back I do not like is the game uses matchmaking, no party create in main menu, you have to physically press play or private and then invite a friend into the game, but even when you select private and have 1 friend, you press play and that session is no longer private! Only the lobby is because you can and most likely will join a random person (happens every time with my wife and I)\n\nThere are a decent supply of maps but my wife and I went through every one in campaign in 8hours (again to date of this review I am writing) we are. Ow playing free mode which is the same maps.... There are other modes but they are... The same maps! Which believe it or not is getting tiring already even though we cannot stop playing the game!\n\nIs it pay to win? Not that I can see!\nI bought the digital deluxe because I enjoyed the alpha code I was given so much, I was given the special blue coin things and found the only thing I could buy with them WAS access the the vault boxes which gave me clothing items (They do nothing, they are only cosmetic) and clothing store clothing (Which again is cosmetic)\nI could not find ANYTHING that makes them useless, you cannot speed upgrade or use them (Too date of writing this review) that would make them worth the money or beneficial to me or the game or like any cash cow, because it is not.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\n\nYes, in a heart beat.  I love some tower defence games and now this is a game that is XP/ Stats/ Gold/ Ranking/ Community and much more on the side to enjoy!","September 12, 2015","true","189.9"," 42 of 55 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","42","55","0","3"

Thats the reason this game is still in alpha, early access. So people can test the core of DD2 and developers fix any problems to create a refined game. Luckily, big content updates are being released giving DD2 more end game something to work towards.","April 2","true","347.3"," 77 of 115 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","77","115","6","6"

In Dungeon Defenders 2 you continue the story as the apprentice, the squire, the huntress, or the monk.  The kids are now what appear to be teenagers with slick overhauled graphics.  And, More characters are coming.  The game is now in early access on Steam and I thought I would provide my initial impressions on this unique game.\n\nJust like the original dungeon defenders game, this is also a hybrid tower defense and Action RPG.  You still get all the same fun loot collecting, leveling, and skill points, along with a slightly tweaked gear upgrade system.\n\nBefore I get too far down the rabbit hole, I was an original Dungeon Defenders 2 Defense Council Member.  This meant I have seen every build prior to the Steam Early Access public release.  This game has progressed immensely from the days of its infancy and with much excitement I am glad to say this is one of the best feeling "Early Access" games I have experienced in a long time.  They did right by the community and didn't release a buggy product.  I have yet to see a crash.  The only issues I have noticed are a few camera clipping issues.\n\nFrom the first few moments in the game you can tell this is a smooth product.  If you were a player of the original this will feel liquid, with a slightly faster pacing.  When the game was initially announced it was going to be a MOBA styled tower defense game that was free to play.  A lot of the original fans were obviously upset that it wasn’t a true continuation of the original game; I was not one of them.  I thought the MOBA style might provide something unique to this game but those ideas were tabled, but will it probably make an appearance in the future in some form.\n\nThe game did keep the Free to Play ideology though and that will likely propel this game to new heights on the PC.  However to actually in the "Early Access" you do have to purchase a copy for $25, or catch it on sale.  This does come with perks such as premium currency, a unique title, and some exclusive skins.  This is the standard fare when a game comes to early access.  However, unlike other free to play titles all items sold for cash currency will, I quote "Never grant gameplay advantage. Ever."\n\nBeing part of Early Access does have a unique perk. Influence.  Influence points are earned every day you login which can be spent to vote on what various features or implementations of features in coming builds.\n\nBack to the game, each playable class has 4 spells and 4 unique "towers".  The game builds upon its original format with each spell and tower unlocking through level progression, along with ability to upgrade the existing towers.  Another area where this game excels over its predecessor is the new Wave Director which will slightly randomize enemy waves.  This could mean different enemy types, where they come from, or various stat buffs.  They are also looking to get in the occasionally, "caught you with your pants down" events.\n\nThis game is currently planning on remaining in Early Access for at least a year.  Hopefully the Trendy can keep up the momentum and keep new exciting features releasing until the game’s final release.\n\nIt currently doesn't have any form of cash shop available, or pets.  The biggest downfall to the game currently is the tedious matchmaking process, which can have you struggling to get in and out games fast.  Layers and layers of menus slow the process even though finding players to play with is the fastest part.\n\nKnowing this game is going free to play but still costs money to play before launch can dissuade a lot of players, but if you enjoyed the first game, tower defense, or casual ARPG games you will easily get your monies worth in entertainment.  This game sets a good example for what Early Access games should be in their launch status.","December 10, 2014","true","40.9"," 90 of 138 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","90","138","0","0"

They tried to stagger your abilities, you get something new practically every round, but it's still about playing the same maps over and over.  I was level 30+, but I couldn't even play the events.  Pretty lame.\n\nI don't even know why they have the tavern.  It's just a glorified menu.  There's no interaction with anyone in there, and when you're in a shared tavern you are likely to get sucked into a game on accident.  That will drop you out of whatever thing you were doing.\n\nBalance is a big issue.  Having a ranged weapon that fires two projectiles is dumb, because neither of them go straight.  They also do 1/2 damage each, so you might as well just get a 1 projectile weapon and hit things.  Attack speed is the same, you do the same DPS whether you're firing 1 or 4 projectiles per second.  There are a few interesting weapons, but they become obsolete very quickly.  Higher tier items have a formula.  You get more effects, but the stats are the same.  The effects are totally unbalanced.  Some of them are super powerful while others don't even make sense.  Eventually I just sold all weapons if they didn't drain HP or if they fired multiple projectiles.\n\nFor a game that is all about items, item management is stupid.  You can get hundreds of drops per round, but there's no way to just sell all the low quality ones or anything.  No favorites.  No filtering.  Just a pain.  I was spending more time selling items than I was playing the game, what with all the waiting for rounds to start and an item overflow that times out too quickly.","December 15, 2015","false","34.3"," 81 of 125 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","81","125","5","1"

Has it been 2 years already?\n\nWell like most I was highly anticipating this game and was expecting that original DD feeling.  Did I get that?  ...Not exactly, but that is ok given games have to evolve in some way, even though it's not always based on our personal wants & needs.  At first I was excited and then somewhat disappointed and then hardly play anymore, but I come back time to time and it seems DDII can't grab me and keep me prisoner like the original still can.  I still recommend this because it has some changes coming, but replay-wise for now, not so much.  I still love the DD universe and appreciate all its parts, so hoping that flare to keep playing returns.\n\nNOTE:  Some of the below are based on friends of friends opinions, but seem to be matching equally to random people I asked the same question.\n\nPROS:\n\n1. Familiar Music themes\n2. Familiar map areas revamped\n3. A little more hero customizations\n4. Knight actually welds a shield without being an accessory\n5. Graphics are well done frame to frame animations\n6. Still maintains that unique hero feeling\n7. Abilities are a bit different, but still enjoyable\n8. Handling pets has changed\n9. New Quest system is realistic & fun\n10. Month-to-month quests for pets & other rewards is a nice addition\n11. Still has that Boss Fight fun factor\n12. Customizing inventory = Names, auto-loot categories, by class, etc and etc\n13. Easy leveling\n\nCONS:\n\n1. Limited inventory compared to the original\n2. You have to purchase inventory slots (Bags)\n3. Towers to damage to creature formulas have changed\n4. Huge limitations on gear upgrades compared to original DD\n5. Handling pets has changed (placed as PRO and CON because it’s a huge argument to most in my circles and circles of circles)\n6. Open tavern creates some negative feedback on the community as a whole and reporting system might as well not exist (can be avoided with solo tavern play or private + inviting friends); which leads to a very immature atmosphere\n7.  Normal Mode difficulty does not feel like Normal mode, so difficulty to difficulty is not a realistic transition from one to the other.\n\n\nMost arguable PROS & CONS:\n\nHandling pets\nGraphics\nAbilities\nOpen Tavern with no control or monitoring\nDifficulty\nEasy leveling (easy to vets but to new players? ...compared to the original)\n\n\nAll-in-all I love that the DD community is still going in some way, but...

Am I not playing due to the unregulated chat?    No, but I see how the racist names and 24/7 bashing among people in the community can alienate many new players and some vets alike.\n6. Will I stream DDII?    No, and it's not because the community is very small, it's just that I only stream/record games I play daily to almost daily = no streaming or YouTube\n\nSo basically I like this game and can recommend it, because I do play it, but for me it lacks that replay value like the original granted.\n\n\nSirspoony rating:    7.5/10","May 2","true","224.8"," 42 of 60 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","42","60","3","0"

He tells you that he values your input and listens to what you say. But then ignores you and runs away yelling lololololol while wearing a crazy cap (CC for short).\n\nAll you can do is stare at the thing that moves, like your hypnotized by the movement and the stupity. You know you could do something better with your time. Do it, run away from the guy with the CC. It's not worth it, he will never change. It's all empty promises.\n\nThere comes a point in every gamers life, when you must realize what's in front of you and let go... Just let it go.. Or don't go there in the first place. It's a wery bad and dark place filled of regrets, and restless nights waking up screaming in the middle of the night...\n\nRemeber It's all a fantasy, like the fantasy you have about this game ever being any good. It's time to face reality.\n\n\n\nAnd if you who tried DD1, DD2 is not the new DD, it's something else but with the same name. The game is just not that interesting or fun. It's like a dull idle game / hold down the button action rpg hybrid.\n\nI have som great memories from DD1, played it around 300 hours. Lots of maps that was fun to explore, just running the map and failing a lot of time just to understand the mob movement, was part of the fun. Finding unique loot on the maps, and big maps that you could get lost running around. There was always a sense of progress. A lot of...  let's try that map again and see if i can go one wave furter, maybe if i tweak a little here and a little there. There was a lot more strategy involved in DD1.\n\nDD2 is like a no brainer action-rpg with towers. You get a clear line that shows where the mobs will be, and chokepoints pointed out where you should build your defences. A lot more focus around finding the right loot, not upgrading loot as in DD1. Now you can spend days just farming for the perfect loot so you can take on the same map as you where farming the loot on.\n\nEven the skins in DD1 was a lot more rewarding since you hade to accomplish something to get the skins, now you just hand over your money and get your skin.\n\nMost of the time you fail a map while in a group is because someone from your team fell asleep and forgot to repair the wall. Or was watching youtube on his/her laptop while holding down the fire butting pointing the bow down a lane not caring what happens in the game at all.\n\nThis game is so bad i regret playing it, I could have done so mutch more with my time like staring at paint while it's drying or contemplating my navel.","February 15","false","447.8"," 48 of 73 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","48","73","3","4"

Yes there are streams every thursday and friday ; Forum activity by the Devs ; A devlog coming out weekly about what the devs are working on!\n-Better than DD1?

Its mind-boggling the scope of how you took a fun game and what should've been an easy sequel, and managed to make something awful. All in the goal of chasing after a market you will never get.  Seriously, it's never going to happen.\n\nSure the graphics are much nicer. Kudos for great artwork trapped in a horrible frame. The gameplay is now awkward. The forced social stuff is exactly that, forced and impersonal; in ways you simply can't seem to understand because there is no point to "team building" in DD2. This isn't an MMO, and it's also not LoL, and it never will be.

As the first one the gameplay is very cool and the maps are wonderful. The characters and towers are very much alike too.\n\nThe bad parts are the one that differs from the original DD. As you level up you are given a very limited and poor choices of specs for your skills and, as I have seen, most of the choices are pretty useless. That messes up a bit with your character customization, since you are forec to buff up a single tower with your specs, and once you get 10+ points on that skill its upgrading becomes pretty useless, since you wil get a 0.45% boost on that skill or less.\n\nThe other aspect is that you can't level up the things you want to play with. You can't level up tower damage, health, hero speed, attack speed etc. You depend on item drop to do that, and you depend A LOT on item drop (and I say A LOT). You can go almost 30 hero levels without ever finding a gear that fits your hero, so you won't play it the way you want for a very long time. That is a terrible decision by the game designers and, for me, what ruined the game, because what makes a good RPG is character creation and the fact that you can costumize you hero to play the way you want to play it. DD2 won't let you.\n\nPersonaly I like to play builder. That is not an option either in DD2, since you get enough "build mana" to build one or maybe two towers in a map. And, if you don't go aura, there is  good chance you will waste your mana by having your tower destroyed in the first waves.\n\nThe other thing is that you cannot kick a player from the map or even vote kick him. So if someone decides to troll the party on the last wave, he will do it, and will remai unpunished. But I believe that there will be something regarding that for after the pre-alpha.\n\nIf the game was just a few dolars expensive or maybe free to play, I would give it 5 stars, but, when I pay almost $20 for it, I feel a lot of regret.","December 9, 2014","false","62.2"," 155 of 270 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","155","270","0","11"

Like before i only needed a barrage of cannon towers and maybe one or two ballistas sitting close together.\nNow with the spacing you cant have as many cannon towers to make the range work all the time which then require the heavy cannonball sphere so you can set out some long range cannonball towers. The heavy cannonball tower isnt as great as the standard one in damage but the range makes it more effective in some lane defences.\n\nThat being said it gets kinda weird to go to your character changing station on the map just to change the sphere so you can set out the heavy cannonball tower then go back and change back to whatever sphere you are using on the ultra sphere slot.\n++ a bigger combination of towers on the map then just three (two good offensive and the wall tower)\n- - weird way to make it happen\n\nsuggestion\nThe heavy cannonball sphere should either have more effects or make the sphere into something else you maybe unlock upon reaching level 50 and not something you have to equip. More like just a alternative version of the cannonball tower that you can EASY change to when in the building stage.\nThis also applies to the other tower changing spheres the other characters have. Its a great idea so i say: more alternative tower version = more gameplay (yeah i know, it requires a lot more work and balancing also).\n\nLoot\nI love how they changed up the hero weapons to have more variety in weapon speed and attack pattern. There is also the special weapons (betsy weapons and spooky weapons and more) and thats real good. "more variety" = "more gameplay" to a certain degree.\n\nStory\nBecause i have played from the start of this game when it was more difficult to see any story then the Dark souls games, i dont have any say in this, i think i have to play from the beginning with a new character to experience it.","December 30, 2014","false","35.0"," 48 of 78 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","48","78","0","1"

I just don’t enjoy playing these “walking stick” characters. I feel that all the small things, that made me enjoy DD1, are no longer part of DD2.\nFor me personally, it’s a huge step back from DD1.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when I played is, that nothing is familiar. Everything is completely different and not in a good way. All the menus such as character, level and inventory menus are very confusing. The enjoyment of upgrading your character and spending time on searching through good items, is no longer there for me. I find find it rather annoying and confusing to go through all the menus.\n\nIn DD1, the mana crystals which are needed to build towers, were so much fun to collect. In DD2, I don’t even see them properly. What happened? Why are they so tiny?\n\nSame for all monsters and player characters along with the weapons. They’re all so small and look like walking sticks. Sometimes the monsters blend into the environment and you can’t even make them out. I don’t like the art design of the 3D models that they went with. I prefer the more “bubbly” look from DD1.\n\nTowers? I loved playing a mage in DD1, the art design was great, but in DD2 all the mage towers look cheap, as if they were rushed.\n\nAnd no, don’t say “Oh but early access, they might change these things”. No they don’t. The development of the game is now focusing on optimizing the game and bug fixes, they are not making any major changes anymore.","December 22, 2015","false","3.3"," 55 of 93 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","55","93","0","2"

It will become Free To Play at around the end of the year. Also, a lot of the negative reviews on the front page are complaining about issues that have been fixed or changed or complaining about features that are not in the game YET.\n\nIn my opinion, This game has a lot of potential. Even though it is currently in early access, it feels like it has enough replayibility to keep me going for hundreds of hours with the latest update. Now, here are some of the pros and cons for the game in its current state.\n\nSome Pros:\n\n+ Pretty art design, the way it is done gives the game a more 'Toon' feel to it.\n+ Alot more enemy diversity compared to DD1.\n+ The Game is regularly updated, with the latest patch adding loads of content in to the game.\n+ The people who work on the game interact with the community and hold Developer streams on Twitch every friday.\n+ According to the developers, There won't be DLC Map packs, so the community won't be split.\n+ The music in the game is good.\n+ The towers have more 'Personality' as i would call it...\n+ Once it goes F2P, It won't be P2W.\n+ Betsy and cute Propellor Cats\n+ If you do buy Early Access, you get $30 worth of ingame currency to buy costumes with.\n\nA few Cons:\n\n- It's in early access, so you have to pay to be able to play it.\n- Tavern is laggy and the game feels slightly unoptimized.\n- Uber Skill Spheres cost waaaaaaay too many Wyvern Tokens.. (i call the tokens 'Betsy Bucks')\n- Level cap that does not take long to reach. (Level Cap will be increased later on)\n- Earlier maps become meaningless to play once you hit level 25. (They are adding Incursions soon for them to make them playable in late game again)\n- Bug paradise\n- No controller support yet.\n\nNote: Most of the problems i have with the game a due to the game still being in development and a lot of the features are not in it yet.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nWhile the game is unfinished and has it's fair share of problems, it's fun, which is what people really look for in games.\n\n8/10 (in it's current state)","April 24, 2015","true","489.8"," 78 of 136 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","78","136","4","0"

DD2 stops being a game of strategy long before you reach even the hard or insane difficulty levels preceding the nightmare ones.\n\nCons:\nGrind, Grind, Grind goes the player. Item drops are arbitrary. What I mean by this is that the high lvl gear that drops as you solo a difficult map, will hardly ever be gear you actually want for ANY of your characters.\n\nWhat adds insult to injury is the carnival ticket mechanic. During every map playthrough, carnival ticket's drop, and for every 10 tickets that drop, you can spin the carnival wheel for the chance of getting Legendary gear of your current avg item lvl. This is the only way to dependably get good gear, because Legendary gear is the best in the game. So, even if it is not perfect for your build you may still be able to use it. To use the wheel in this way requires that you equip terrible tier gear that have high item lvls. This way you increase your avg item level before you spin the wheel.\n\nIf you do not have tickets, you can use 2500 in game currency to spin the wheel. So, you end up farming maps for gold, then spinning the wheel until you get better gear, finally playing the same old maps at a higher difficulty setting, and then restarting the process all over again to advance to the next difficulty setting.\n\nTherefore, this game is more than just a grind fest, but also a redundant waste of time with no true reward for effort expended.\n","March 26","false","114.0"," 47 of 79 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","47","79","2","0"

It's Pay to customise (mainly your look)  there are a few convinances that cost also (like extra bag space) but in general you don't pay for better weapons, upgrades, faster leveling, or anything else required to win.

The company listens to the players, lets you vote on upcoming choices and has great live streams where they actually address and answer YOUR questions.

Technically tower defense but not really. Hack-n-slash and pew pew game that takes almost no skill at all. Farm endlessly for no reason because there's literally nothing else to do.\n\nNo real strategy. Basically block off every path and prevent the mobs from getting through. Have good gear = win. Not having good gear actually makes it fun and challenging but the fun doesn't last all that long.\n\nThere's essentially one only one way to play each of the 4 characters. There is no depth to this game at all.\n\nHigh level play, like level 30+, devolves to players swapping their high level characters in to place OP towers and afk every round. Bugged flying mobs are the only thing keeping people active because it slows down the farmfest. Beyond level 40 the game begins to feel nearly dead. Probably because people with half a brain don't keep playing hoping it gets more interesting like I did. There are barely any players to play with aside from the farmers. Once you find a farmer, you can afk and go do something better with your time. Literally anything.\n\nYou constantly replace gear because this game is all about ascending and descending in power. Take a few zeros off the numbers and check it out! It's as if you're still level 10! The difference is maybe your weapon looks cooler and your gear icons glow and have colorful borders.\n\nThe gear you are constantly replacing isn't shown on your character. Instead, the devs have opted for costumes that you can buy with real money so your character actually changes appearance aside from weapons. Some of the costumes are cool but that's not going to excuse how silly the Squire runs and pretty much just makes it look even more ridiculous. It's like the devs looked at the melee character and said, "Make this one pretty much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥." However, the attack animations are pretty damned good. The character goes from derp to Spartan warrior at the click of a button.\n\nIt's charming and could be cool but deep down, just like The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot, it's garbage and will be until time erases it.","December 29, 2015","false","32.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The fact that when you level you cant put any upgrade points into tower stats is a massive fail, it is necessary to reinstate this to be able to even have the smallest chance on higher difficulties. The fact is to improve your towers you are completelly reliant on equpment drops (which are rare as ♥♥♥♥)\nThe lack of controller support is annoying for now but i understand that this will be added later so isnt that important of a point to make now.\nThe graphics are a nice improvement and i like the art style in general.\nTrash equpment that nobody wishes to pick up now no longer vanishes and gets banked at the end of each wave it stays until the end of the map making everything look cluttered by the end and instead of auto selling everything and splitting the cash it splits it into each persons inventory which you then have to manually sell or wait a few days for the auto sell.\nthe preorder stated $30 of in game cash but my account has 0, not sure if thats a UK thing but i havent got a dime.\n\nThe map order is strange and have yet had a chance to work out what sort of order I should be doing them in with no solid structure like numbering added to the map names it is slightly confusing. The lobbies need an option to kick or to votekick idle players as they come in the game and build a few towers the reap the benefits of xp with no action able to be taken against them and it gets worse when the random lobby host is rolled onto them on endgame and everyone has to find a new lobby.\n\nThe building mana needs to have a higher drop rate as I have gone through games only being able to build a handful of towers that are then just destroyed as I dont have enough mana to upgrade or repair them.\n\nTo sum up, levelling feels pointless apart from being able to equip slightly better armour now and then when the lynchpin of all rpg style games is character progression and on dd2 it feels completely dead and worthless. Many more issues such as droprates need to be looked at and until this is updated i will probably stay away from this game for now. I will change my reccomendation upon further updates if improvements are made.\n","December 10, 2014","false","18.6"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","2"

The opposite goes for players that spend XXX hours playing the first Dungeon Defenders.\n\nAnyway let's write about few things that I would like you guys to know...\n1. This time they've made a game as F2P(free to play) with cosmetic microtransactions(mostly) as Cash Shop. Don't be fooled by this. Character slots are limited to 4 - you need to pay to get more slots. And you will need more, when new characters will be introduced to the game. The second problem is you Inventory, starting bags are limited, they fill with items really quick - more bags of course are available with cash. It wouldn't really be that big problem if the items like chests or pet stuff would stack, but sadly it doesn't...\n2. Unlike DD1 you characters here have more skills to use, which is kinda nice - 3 skills + heal, but you have less towers to build, only 4.\n3. Game looks a bit better than DD1, a bit more cartoony I would say.\n4. If the game host got crappy connection or his internet will start doing some nasty stuff(high ping, dropping packets, etc) you and other players will be laggy as hell, be ready for that.\n5. Pet hatching time, 48h to hatch an egg - hatching can fail(no pet, sorry)\n6. Number of trash items dropped isn't bad, like it was in DD1, it was earlier in alpha but they've reduced trash drops.\n7. No character customization - just outfits unlocked via chests.\n\nI think that would be all I can think about at the moment.\nTo sum it up, DD1 sucked me in for many, many hours of fun, and I really enjoyed it and love the game, while DD2 just doesn't feel this way, it lacks something that keeps you interested in the game.\n\nIn a bit funny way I will type this:\nYou sit at the table and you see two things on this table - 1. Sandwitch with cheese(represents DD2) and 2. Pizza(represents DD1). Which one would you pick? - This is how I see this two games.\n\nDD1 - 9/10 (-1 for the number of trash drops)\nDD2 - 4.5/10","January 29","false","12.2"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

It just feels like a generic knockoff of Dungeon Defenders 1. The levels feel really claustrophobic, the lanes are so tight that when your towers are firing down a lane it looks like the finale to a 4th of july fireworks show, obscuring all sight of what is actually coming down the lane. The movement just doesnt feel intuitive and many objects on the levels seem to have almost the same height as your jumps apex making navigation through the tight levels a pain. The only thing i do like is the new action skills but other then that the game is a huge letdown and id recommend just playing DD1 over this mess.\n\n**Update: The game has improved alot. theyve fixed some of the movement issues. collisions could use some work because atm u get stuck on many invisible objects and cant walk over any little bump so u have to jump alot to get onto things that you would think u could just walk right up onto. its easier to see the mobs coming over the graphical effects from your towers, although it can still get a little crazy at times and could be toned down abit or use more transparent effects. atm they seem to use alot of opaque 2d sprites for effects that obscure everything behind them. net code could use work when your in the tavern but seems to be pretty good in co-op matches. figuring what stats have what on an item has been greatly simplified and is much more intuitive now. im still not a fan of the small inventory. u can buy larger bags with earned gold though so thats a plus and alleviates quite abit of that headache but it still feels lacking when u start to play multiple char's. overall though they have improved the game greatly and is worth trying if u were a big DD1 fan. keep an eye on it atleast.","December 7, 2014","false","36.5"," 31 of 51 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","31","51","0","2"

It may not be your viewpoint, so proceed with caution.\n\nUPDATE 3\nAfter coming to check this out again after the Halloween patch, I was pleased to find levelups give you more control over your character, two new maps, and other additions such as weapon types. For the first time since I bought it, I felt that the Dungeon Defenders experience was becoming cohesive. If they continue along this path I feel we're sure to get something worth a look. It may not measure up to DD1's legacy just yet, but I'm hopeful that we're going to see something great. I still have problems with Item Power and I wish item descriptions were given like the original game (those icons made it easy to know exactly what your weapon was gonna give you at a glance. Text doesn't work as well for me.) but it's gotten better since the last update. Also, it's free, so anyone can give it a go and make a more informed decision. Seriously, stop reading reviews and go give it a go.\n\nUPDATE 2\nWith the Loot and Survive patch, the game has come much closer to being something I'd spend a lot of time on. With the addition of a real campaign and direction, the maps are tied together much more compellingly. However, beyond the campaign has been problematic, though they have and will continue to fix issues. I do take issue with the Item Power system, as it is consistently inaccurate with its representation of items, forcing me to appraise items myself (for instance, an item that would give me around 50 of both magical and physical resistance was placed below one with 50 physical resistance). This is frustrating. In addition, I still wish for more customization (levelups are meaningless to me without my input on how my character grows). That aside, however, for the most part this was a good update.\n\nUPDATE\nHaving played the new patch, I've noticed a few things. One: They have begun monetization and Costumes are now available for purchase with gems. In addition, the Perks system has been replaced by a new system I haven't had time to try out, but seems sound in theory. However, it's a mixed bag: I've noticed an abundance of Chests, which can be opened for rare items and costumes...with Gems. That feels very P2W to me, and I'm very against it. That's really the only black mark on DD2's record at the moment, but it's a big one. EDIT: The Skill Spheres system is much closer to customization than the previous system, with the highest-level sphere completely changing your one of your towers. While I would love for them to go even farther, I'm happy with Spheres.\nEDIT: Fixed a typo (spear).\n\nFirst off, Dungeon Defenders II is a very pretty game. It looks excellent, the gameplay feels solid, but it's missing one core element that made me spend hundreds of hours in Dungeon Defenders 1: Customization. Perks are nice, but they don't change gameplay. The beauty of DunDef1 was in the myriad of playstyles: I built a ferocious multishot apprentice that would zip around the map, mowing enemies down. He couldn't build towers AT ALL, but he was strong. I had another Apprentice that couldn't fight at all, but had unrivaled towers. These both made the game VERY different to play through, and that was awesome.\n\nI'm not getting that in Dungeon Defenders II.\n\nThat said, it's still very enjoyable. I just don't see myself investing hundreds of hours, I see myself investing a few more every time they update. And I don't want it to be like that.\n\nShould you buy? If you liked Dungeon Defenders 1, then sure. If not, give that one a go and come back.","March 29, 2015","true","60.5"," 33 of 55 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","33","55","3","8"

Stuck behind a grindy pay-wall.......... I supported this game forever ago with a lot of cash and I have to grind or pay $10 USD for the new content. I love DLC in early access games <3. Before you charge me for new content, polish your netcode and engine.\n\nI still stand behind the idea that you'll get your time's worth of entertainment here. That being said, after leveling one or two characters, there isn't any reason to return to the game. It's not the lack of content, but the lack of well-polished content. Loot is confusing and clunkier than it was before, and there quickly becomes no incentive to play early-encountered maps. You'll still enjoy your time here, even if that time is less than 20 hours.\n\n--- ORIGINAL REVIEW ---\n\nTLDR: Great MMO-Tower Defense-RPG romp with enough content on offer to justify the purchase as-is.\n\nAn incredible experience. Well worth the fee to enter the Alpha. I'd be freaking enraged if the developers did not make true on their word and finish the game with the features they had discussed. But, I wouldn't feel like I was out any money if they didn't. I've had so much fun with the content on offer, and there is a ton of it. About 10 hours to beat the campaign with each character (for a total of 40), and you will not be max level by then.\n\nAfter that, there are still about 4 more gameplay modes that your characters can enjoy that help level them to the cap! In addition, the Free-To-Play model being implemented here is solely for skin customizations and inventory space. (Spend your gems on the inventory space) Skins can be unlocked through random crate drops a la Counter-Strike, but those can be opened with tokens earned in-game.

As other have said, no controller support yet, and no split-screen local multiplayer either!! So those 2 things right there limit my enjoyability for this game since my brother and I have been playing the original DD together for a few years.\n\nAlso, I'm not a fan of the forced online "instances", a la MMORPGs. I hate those kind of games. I generally play games alone or locally with a friend, or very rarely with a friend online. I seriously do not have any interest in playing with random people online. I did not know this was the case before I bought it.\n\nAnd, did something change, because I distinctly remember the Dungeon Defenders website saying that DD2 would be a free-to-play game, with in-game purchase of items, levels, etc. Yet they're asking $24.99 (20% off until 12/12) for this unfinished game! I went ahead and bought it yesterday anyway, though, since I loved DD1, but the current state of the game leaves a lot to ask for.\n\nYes, I get that they're calling this "pre-alpha" and "early access". But since this game has been in development for a long time now, I would have imagined they be further along, and at least have the same features as the first game (controller support, splitscreen multiplayer, pop up menus for your powers/summons, ability to upgrade your items in your inventory with mana, etc.)\n\nThe good: The game looks great; the graphics and animations are well polished. Some neat new game play aspects. Simplified mechanics, each hero now only gets 4 types of powers and 4 kinds of summonable defenses.\n\nThe bad: Core features are missing! HELLO? What happened to controller support and split screen multiplayer??? Also, the music gets repetitive very fast. Some of the new aspects and mechanics are confusingly presented. For instance, you can't get your inventory or character stats without visiting the defenders forge. Level ups seem to be automatic, except for points you can distribute, but you must go to the forge.\n\nAs others have said, you don't get as much green mana for summoning as DD1. Basically there's now blue mana for powers and green mana for summons. In my 2 hours of play so far, the levels end up littered with blue mana crystals that I can't pick up because I'm already full, yet my green mana is either empty or nearly half full. I guess this is a balance problem, hopefully they'll address it.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Not worth even the sale price of $19.99. They need to bring back the core features I loved about DD1. Maybe once they've released a few more patches it'll be up to my expectations.","December 7, 2014","false","6.1"," 66 of 117 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","66","117","0","1"

The item progression and character progression make you feel more powerful as you play. The art style is unique and fun. Having it free to play is a bold move, but having paid for access earlier, I do not feel rewarded.\n\nHowever, this is a shell of what it could have been. Dungeon Defenders 1 had more classes, a better item system, a higher level cap and even more enemies (feels better killing 1000 enemies rather than 100). Rather than refining on a tried and true model, they created a different game, taking multiple steps backwards. Character leveling takes far too long, enemies do not spawn properly, waves take ages...\n\nAfter the trainwreck of Dungeon Defenders Eternity and this game falling flat, I cannot recommend this game, or even Trendy. While they produce many podcasts, they seem to have almost no involvement with the community (or at least the vast majority). The games have tons of bugs, many of which should have been easy fixes.

This is what I will say for now, however:\nThe game is rather similar to the original DD but to me it just feels straight up bad in comparison. Let's talk about the main two components of both games, combat and strategy:\n\nThe combat of this game is quite different to the original, in the original you will be greeted by hordes of weak enemies who surround you and make combat a challenge as you smoothly slice or gun them down dodging lots of orcs (basically like big tank enemies who slowly swing big axes) and projectiles along the way, it sounds easy but as there are so many of them, it makes it an awesome but still balanced challenge.\nHowever, in this second installment, it's changed for the worse, there are around 15 enemies on each part who all just feel a chore to kill, they have a lot more health but as it's not a proper fun horde, they are all easy to dodge and kill, it just takes AGES, it takes around 5 hits just to kill a goblin (a small enemy which is extremely weak, obviously there are a lot more in DD1). Did I mention melee? Using a melee weapon is just annoying as anything, every attack lunges you forward in the most awkward and uncontrollable way with a melee weapon. I've fell off cliffs trying to fight as a squire (the knight class in the game), so melee weapons and melee combat has just turned to total crap. Ranged weapons aren't any better though, really, all you do with one is move backward and shoot, which is no fun, I'd probably rather be a messed up knight, jerking uncontrollably. Basically, all the combat really is, is hitting and using your abilites when you can (just extra powerful attacks in this game really, and self healing). Squires can block but in this game it's useless as anything, I don't even see any difference in the damage they do me.\n\nThe strategy in this is probably even worse than the combat, let's start with DD1, all the maps could be built up in lots of different ways, some ways a lot better than others, all of the good looking builds worth trying, if you're smart (or you just have ridiculously high stats for the level) you can just build up and sit back to watch it perfectly working, or just grab a cup of tea. Now let's look at DD2, there are two obvious builds for every map, put turrets on the walls of the map and walls to block them off as they die, or just put turrets and walls on the obvious bits of the path. Both aren't really that different at all and no matter whether you chose the best out of the two possible decent builds or not, all the towers need constant supervision, repairing, fighting and all that. There are also environmental traps (such as valves you turn to release smoke and damage the enemies) which you NEED to use, forcing a lot of players in one game, it's hard to play with just one friend, you end up on a public game packed with 7 year old idiots. All the towers also have huge like spaceboxes so you can't place a tower within a meter's range of another, making placing them properly difficult, in DD1 they just couldn't overlap, unless they were monk or hunter traps. In short, there's no real strategy, you just need to run around like a headless chicken attending to your towers and activating environmental traps.\n\nLet's move on to looting, this isn't that main a thing in both but it gets a verrrrrrrrrrrry annoying in DD2, you get a new, better weapon almost every wave and upgrading them does barely anything to the stats, all considered (In DD1 you need to upgrade your weapon to do good damage, which in my opinion is good). There is an option to automatically collect loot but it fills up the few bag spaces you have in DD2 very fast and you find yourself sorting good from rubbish after every level. There aren't many different models the items can spawn with either, so you will probably find someone with the same weapon as you in a public tavern. There's also only like 20 different pets in DD2 but tonnes in DD1 and in DD1 EVERYTHING spawns in different sizes and colours, nothing does in 2. This makes looting very bland. The items do spawn with different weights but this is broken so that heavier weapons do more damage per second, even with the same damage stats.\n\nNow on to DLC, there's a lot of better, more optional and reasonably priced DLC in the first game, such as different characters with unique abilities but in DD2 it's inventory space for £20, More items and IN GAME FREAKING CURRENCY(!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????) for £30, how reasonably priced, fun and worth it this is (sarcasm BTW), oh and if anyone wants it's £17 for a costume pack on special offer!\n\nSummary:\nDD2= rubbish\nDD1= awesome\nIf you like the look of this then just play DD1, you'll have a much better time.","December 27, 2015","false","7.8"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","2"

What I see are a bunch of little changes that I found unnecessary, the little things so to speak. For example...\n\n-Mana crystals\n\nIn the first DD it was fun just running around watching the mana crystals float around and gobbling them up. Killing an ogre and watching it explode into huge mana crystals was oddly satisfying. And seeing the ground littered with mana crystals after destroying wave after wave of minions was awesome. Now there are just little uninspiring little diamonds, just makes it feel more grindy.\n\n-Towers\n\nThe towers feel kind of meh. I mainly played as a squire, the cannon balls towers in the first game which albeit not the best towers were hilarious to set up and watch all the balls just go bouncing around. They are replaced by generic projecticle explody turrets. The ballista towers which were so fun to just watch go pew pew pew and tens of ballista projectiles go all around the map is so boring now. They just fire every 5 seconds or whatever and the range sucks.\n\nAdditionally my friend plays a monk and I don't like how the auras from the monks are just so small and are basically circles on the ground instead of huge epic semi spheres. All these little changes that just make the game less epic compared to the first DD.\n\n-Maps\n\nThe maps are alright. Nothing amazing, nothing outright bad. All of them boil down to find chokepoints, build towers at chokepoints, kill big health mini boss at end of round. Gets kinda repetitive after a while. But its the beginner maps so thats to be expected.\n\n-Armor\n\nI was highly disappointed that armor doesn't show up on your character still. Felt like that would've been an obvious added feature upgrade from the first DD.\n\n\nAnyway, I know I've only played ~8 hours on this game so far, but I compare this with my experience with DD I.\n\nWhen I first got DD I i was skeptical of the game, I got it for like 5 bucks and thought it was going to be one of those play for 5 hours and forget it indie games. But then I logged over 400 hours officially but probably alot more (steam account got reset), got to end game farming perfect 600/600/600/600 kobolds and selling for cubes, getting the super legendary skins etc, I played that game to the fullest.\n\nCompared with this game I went in with so much enthusiasm and after 7 hours or so I just feel meh.\n\nOverall, I know alot of these criticisms seem kind of small but for me they all add up to a product that in its current state just doesn't have the 'magic' of DD I.","August 30, 2015","false","12.5"," 74 of 134 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","74","134","2","3"

So i just left DD1 behind and seeked out all the great potential from DD2 (Comparing DD1 to DD2 will be more fair when DD2 gets an actual release)\n\n-So the game can be played both solo and with other players, i've been playing solo more or less all the way and i haven't encountered any problems that way (My experience when playing with others was just frustrating, lack of communication and semi-afk people)\n\nBut i would say that the game feels very smooth with it's wonderful design, a very toony feel which i absolutely love within games. It sorta feels like it's a key enhancer for this game.\n\nI've encountered some small freeze lags here and there (especially when i upgrade items), but it's really no big of a deal. I wouldn't expect anything else from a pre-alpha game.\n\nThe way you choose maps in the game so far so is to me a big mystery.. I don't think anyone would say it's a very appealing to replay old levels at a little harder difficulty.. It becomes boring\n\nThrow some ideas at trendy how to make ^above^ better.\n\nBut let's just cut to the end,\n\nDo i recommend this game?: Of course i do! It's a fun addictive game that you can enjoy for many hours to come. And i have a big trust in Trendy :)\n\nI wanna throw in some words from another review i read before: If Trendy follows their heart it's bound to become good, Very much true!","December 9, 2014","true","266.6"," 46 of 82 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","46","82","0","0"

Don't get me wrong this isn't a bad game or anything it's just not as fun as the first one and a lot of that has to do with the littering of real money pay options and the inclusion of a live tavern. I can't tell you how hard it is to get into this game when you're surrounded by people who are already way into the game, it feels like I'm a scrub and there's no point in continuing the journey.\n\nIn fact of the three times I've launched and attempted to play two of the times I just logged out because I was surrounded by players speaking an entirely different game language than I was used to and felt just overwhelmed by the amount of new. Not just players, or a new game, but even exploring a cluttered hub with large notifications yelling at me that 'this part is unlocked after XXXXX is beat!' was all just way overwhelming coupled with a new UI that feels like a mix between a moba style skill layout and a diablo II ability clone I was just constantly overwhelmed.\n\nThe third time I played I made it two minutes before I ended up loading DD1 and playing on a much more comfortable and smaller scale. I may return since it is so early but it's just so different from the game I fell in love with and I know the only way I can solidly play this is if a friend drags me along.","December 26, 2015","false","10.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Easily clocked over 1.5k Hours. Even had a Carry shop. Now that was a stratigic tower defense game.\n\nNow DD2 not so much. The game is F2P now and it shows. A once fun and enjoyable series is now very blandtastic, bug support is non exsistent especially for in game mico transactions. Everytime they patch the game they seem to break more things than they fix.\n\nIf this game was suppose to be the new upgraded shiny version of DD1 they failed and failed horriably. This is a soft shell of what it could and should have been. The gameplay is stale and very limited in terms of what and how you can use. The meta is overly boring and require no skill at all to get to the the "hardest" difficulty of NM4.

Costumes in the previous one were able to be achieved through quests and fun game types, whereas in DD2 you must pay. Also, to open chests which include 'oh-so-rare' loot, you must buy keys.\n\nIt's a good tower defense game, but definitely something that gets old faster than Dungeon Defenders 1 -- you'll get bored from the inability of accessing cooler items in the game.","January 1","false","2.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OhhPaigey/recommended/236110/","OhhPaigey","OhhPaigey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OhhPaigey/","84 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHere I'll give you my opinion on the game.\n\nI never played DD1, and I got this game 7 months ago. I did help Trendy beta test a game they were working on (Monster Madness Online) internally, so I did learn a lot about how they work, and manage things, ect.\n\nFirst things first, you can expect constant updates and changes if they don't like how something is working, this company works very hard on their games, and they aren't here to just sell the game in early access and then throw up their hands and stop working on it. This is one game you can buy and know for sure that things will always be getting added/changed, ect.\n\nSo what can you expect yourself to be doing in this game? Well at the beginning you will be doing the Campaign, it's basically a long tutorial with a bit of a story to it, unless you/your group fails the zone, you won't be replaying the same area more than once during this Campaign, you will amass a ton of loot and after each zone, I like to replace/sell whatever items I've gotten. Once you've finished the campaign you will be doing "higher difficulty" zones, this is the worst part of the game according to most people I've spoken with, because it's literally just grinding for gear and replaying the same zones, so that can be a negative depending on the person.\n\nWhat customization do you have in the game? Right now there are 4 classes, you can build each class in two ways, you can focus your stats & spheres (explained later) on your hero doing the bulk of your damage, or you can focus your stats on your Towers doing the bulk of your damage. What are spheres? These are kind of like "talents" from other games, where once you reach a certain level you unlock a new sphere slot, this can buff your skills, your mana regeneration, and a bunch of other things. There's also a new feature recently added into the game, it's kind of like "transmogrification" from WoW, this allows you to change what clothing your character is visibly wearing, without losing stats of your actual items.\n\nExtra bits I forgot to mention: You can not change your skills, whatever class you choose has 4 "hero" skills (like maybe an AoE spell, or a bomb that slows enemies down, ect. Each class also has 4 "building/tower" skills, so you may have a Fireball turret, an Ice Beam Turret, mines, ect. Again, you don't have an option to change any of these 8 skills, but each class has different skills. Building requires green mana, which you get from killing monsters and running over the green crystals they drop, and at the end of each round you open a chest that gives you a lot of green mana to help upgrade/make/repair towers. There is a limit on how many towers your group can place in a map, however it's a fairly reasonable amount. And then there's blue mana which is for your hero's skills, these drop much more frequently than green mana, and you will use whatever amount a skill requires if you cast it.\n\nSo that's about it, I hope this helped somebody make their decision on buying the game, I purposely skipped some mechanics in the game because it would take too long to explain. Overall I'd recommend picking up the game, it's pretty cheap and you can always be expecting updates and changes, and Trendy is a company that does listen to player feedback quite regularly.","August 4, 2015","true","53.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

They say it's all grinding, and its stupid, and that DD 2 should be just like DD 1. Now heres the truth, these people just dont remember the beggining of DD 1. Sure you could beat the set of levels to proceed to the next 3, but guess what? Usally those levels were IMPOSSIBLE for your level! Sure Sure, you could say that you just needed skill in tower defense to win, but remember how you unlocked toweres? By grinding! Not just a little grinding, ALOT of ginding. For me atleast I thought it was alot of grinding. So then I play through the story, replaying the same levels over, and over again until I win. Then guess what? I was level 30, so all the challenges were ♥♥♥♥♥ IMPOSSIBLE! I had to gind to 50 to have a chanse at those. I went hell no, and downloaded the DLC. I invited my buddy over to play and guess what? It was impossible for a level 30. So you know what I did? I grinded my ♥♥♥ of. So please dont tell me DD 2 is a grind fest, because DD 1 beats it sooooo far out of the ballpark, it's in a whole new planet. All these people remember is the end game, but there was a incredibly long grind to victory.\n\nNow lets talk more about DD 2 way of handling levels. You start in the 1-3 level select. With my three characters it takes one game to unlock more levels, therefore in the 3-5 group. I play another game and I'm not there so I play an online match to get levels faster and boom I unlock another (this time set) of levels. See the way this works? The game is just helping you through the grind with you having to sometimes replay levels to level up, instead of giving you a level your 10 levels off beating, then you keep getting to the last wave and crying when you wasted 30 minutes of your life. Then I have to grind previous levels, then every level replay it until I'm stroung enough. This is more of a way to let you know if your stroung enough. Could it not force you to not play those levels... well yes but you'll die anyways so I dont really care.\n\nNow on to the review side of these DD 2 has some proublems. First I wish there was a story, but oh well it's only pre-alpha and it will be added later. (plus, who play DD 1 for the story any way?.) Next is the glitches. Theres a wierd teleporing all over the map/tavern glitch that keeps happening, but again it's in pre-alpha so what did you expect? Third point is that while weapons and shields change with loot, the armour never changes and I REALLY what this to change because I'm disencoureged to find armour when that new sword will be flaming, or that new staff have a crystal with mist around it. Kind of a knit pick but, it does effect how I play so I put it here. (plus this game is so good I don't have many knit picks, and im the biggest knit picker I know.) Lastly is a good and bad thing that won't apply to everyone. You have a character deck for who you can switch out in between waves like in DD 1, only the limit is 3. So if your like me and levels all 4 characters, say good bye to one or later when theres DLC but 2 other characters and cobine them with your left out choice. This may not affect most people because they have only one character, but I had to say good-bye to my monk... for now.\n\nNow the good things, aww yeah. Lets start with the obvious, the GRAPHICS ARE SO GOOD. I mean like INCREDIBLY good levels of good. Set this game to high and you won't be sorry. Also EVERYTHING look 10 times beter from background, to envirment, to the glourious loot, to my favorites the characters and enemys. My good good there so detailed, the goblins which are the weakest trash enemys of the game are so detailed, clearly someone spent countly mounths perfecting each design to make it just perfect. AND THIS IS IN PRE-ALPHA! Not even the full game yet!\n\nNext good thing is the level design. DD 1 was good, even amazing, but this is borderline pefection. I mean it there was some clearly good designers here. You all deserve a cookie, wait no a pie. Infact I'm coming to Trendy with pies for everybdy, unless there to busy prefecting more enemy's and loot. Next is the new lines that show the path of all the enemys. Thats right, theres no more comlaing that you lost because you didnt know a enemy ogre could go there, or a pack of colbots went another direction you didnt expect. (I HATE COLBOLTS! I take it back, goblins arn't all trash I take it all back.)\n\nThe next thing amazing about this game is what was in my opinion, not that solid in DD 1, the combat. In DD 1 the combat was simple, press button alot in a swarm of enemy's and when you lose to much health (which im garunteeing you will in survival mode on mave 15) go and heal. The best thing about combat was the  ogers, but they were so slow you just have to back off while they attack and go in for the kill after the attack. Simple, and with a friend you could trick the AI shooting at him from both sides, and therefor confusing him making him turn around alot. Then the ninjas were stupid, would lose me all the time, and shouldnt be in DD 1 in the first place. In DD 2 It's much better. First off all death has a big consenquense. when you die your dead for a LONG while instead of 10 seconds, so dont ever die. Next healing costs alot of blue gems and takes a long time. So don't get hurt, because theres a consequense unlike the DD 1 where you wait 2 seconds to heal. The combat its self is more balenced so squire wont steal all the kills like in DD 1, and most importantly the enemy AI is good in combat. They are worthy opponets and running in with a sword to a giant lizard (forgive me I forgot there name.) Will hurt alot or kill you unles you sheild ALOT or back away at the right time, and shooting the lizards is just as hard because you'll have a arrow (or mana) vs acid the giant lizard is spitting. And thats just one enemy. Trust me, the AI is better.\n\nNext is the class balencing issues with DD 1, Squire is way to Over Powered, Wizard is Over Powered and has mana bomb, Monk is balenced with nothing good or bad about him, and huntess us Under Powered with long reloades. On the other hand DD 2 made everyone good in there own way, and the huntress is even one of the three people in my main deck.\n\nNext is the defenses themselves for each character are more balenced but if your solo, you need the wizards or squires blockades. The best thing about the new defenses this time is there alot more fun, like the guyser the sendes enyemes flying in the air for you to shoot. There really cool, and the huntress traps have way more ammo.\n\nI'm going to stop here because this review would go on forever but i'll start the conclusion. If you love DD 1 you'll love this game but remember, there is a little grinding that you may of forgot from all that time in the end game. If your new I would wait until this becomes free to play, with DLC on the way. I say this because there is no tutorial for newbies, however if your new and your friend is begging for  you to play now I HIGHLY recommend this. Play with ypur friend a little while and you'll soon get the game inside and out. I want to cut this short so message me if you have any questions about thing like level count, loot, ect.

Here you get 4 for each but expect to only be using like one or two of them.\n\nI liked the monk in the first game so I picked him again here. My job is to put up boost auras on each tower and then baby sit them all. My lightning field just doesn't help all that much and it's much better to just boost the mages fire tower.\n\nSo the strat me and my brother have been using it. Mage shield, mage fire tower and then boost aura. Every single time we played it. Not even the slightest hint of being able to change anything with the setup.\nIt's boring, soul crushingly boring.\n\nAlso you basically get up the setup on the first and second round and after that it's mainly buffing up the towers.\n\n\nTl:dr version: Developers added bare minimum in terms of towers and variation and it's making the game pretty damn boring.\n\nGet Orc Must Die 1 and 2 if you want a quality Tower Defense game. Some actual planning in those two games.","February 5","false","4.2"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","18","30","0","0"

Now, it is online only. In DD1, with a push a button, you can see your tower set. Push another button, you can repair or heal yourself/towers. Now, you have to push a few more buttons to repair or heal. I like the look of the game and the fact you can build towers without needing to be there anymore but the tower placing, equipment, and attacking are completely different. Control tutorials dont change when a controller is connected. So good luck finding out how to ready up or build towers with a controller when they say hit G. I don't recommend this yet but have high hopes they don't require us to buy gems to progress like most F2P games.","January 11","false","1.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","2"

Can it be played without paying? sure, but I remember the days when this stuff we pay for now was referred to as unlockable content already in the game. YOU PLAYED TO UNLOCK STUFF BECAUSE THAT WAS HALF THE FUN.  Game is bleh, I dont recommend. You will have more fun playing the first one even though its loot system is broke.\n\nBetween Xbox 360 and the pc version I played the original dungeon defenders well over 1000 hours combined, it was a game I absolutely loved.  Then the announcement came for dungeon defenders 2 and I was all giddy and super excited for its release.  Then I read that it would be free to play, and my excitement turned to "meh".  Because we all know what free to play really means. But i remained optimistic, so I bought the game a couple months ago.  I must say I am incredibly disapointed.  Every time I turn around I am bombarded with treyarchs "give us money" free to play philosophy and im tired of it.  Wanted an extra bag? gotta pay for it, want another hero slot? gotta pay for it. want some costumes? gotta pay for it.  Most recently however is, want to get super rewards? give us money for a chance at a loot wheel.\n\nAs for the game itself, meh, levels are not very fun, balance between champions and towers are just bad.  The progression system could have been awesome, but it turned out to be "meh" as well.  Playing with friends is boring, one person sets everything up, everyone else just pulls out their dps champions while the tower person just sits in a corner watching every one else mindlessly shoot enemies in their lane, and this is nightmare 4 im talking about, the current hardest difficulty.\n\nThis game is nothing like the first one, its been in development for some 50 freaking years and they've got very little content to show for it. I cant recommend this game. Maybe the developers will pull magic out of their ♥♥♥ and actually put out a decent game but at the moment its a money sink and nothing more.","February 11","false","112.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Now I am not saying that DD1 is bad, It's brilliant, but personally I think DD2 shines where DD1 failed to do so.\n\nYes it is a bit cheesy that they are selling the same charachters again for dlc, but remember, it IS free to play.\n\nIf you have played this game when it was pay to play, let me reasure you that it is almost a different game, everything is alot smoother and flows better.\n\nOne of the only things I am dissapointed in is the lack of upgrading items and pets at low level, which in my opinion let players get used to it before choosing a pet was the most important thing in the game.\n\nAnother is the lack of harder difficulties on low level players, I love a challenge and was dissapointed to see that the hardest difficulty for my noob mage was Normal. What happened to trying to beat The Deeper Well on Insane level 1 char only?\n\nThis game is definantly worth getting since it is an amazing game, if i were to put a price on it, I would say around $15-$20 AUD. but since its free there is no reason not to give this a spin.","April 25","true","63.7"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","21","36","0","0"

The difficulty of the game for starters was not easy and it took time to learn how to play.\n\nThe same can be said about Dungeon Defenders II currently. It's difficult, it isn't easy to learn, and there isn't ANY DLC just yet. However, this is currently an Early Access Game and it isn't the end of it's expansion. Currently I would recommend this game to be played with friends and you will have a fun time exploring the new maps, learning the new mechanisms, and enjoying the overall gameplay with friends.\n\nThis game singleplayer is not recommended at all because it requires alot of strategy and time to understand the complexity of the new set of towers and defenses, finding out what works for you. You only get 3 heroes overall per map (unless there is more in later levels or something) and you can only do certain maps and difficulties in a particular level range so power-leveling your characters is not really that much of an option.\n\nHaving more people on your team also gives you a better chance at an item bonus so working with 3 other people aside from yourself is the most ideal way to make it through every map and level range. This game is a great multiplayer game and is far superior to Dungeon Defenders when it first started out. It is more balanced and fair and it makes the game a little more challenging and competitive.\n\nAnyone who does not like this game only doesn't like it for the fact that the game isn't done.\nThis is an Early Access Game and it isn't completely finished. They haven't even brought out the PvP just yet and they are already complaining about the Co-Op. All the heroes have not been released yet and it certainly makes for an interesting game to watch come into development.\n\nHighly recommended.","January 5, 2015","true","21.8"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","16","27","0","0"

To be honest, I was extremely skepticle on whether or not it would be worth my $14.99 for, and it's not (Maybe), but I got it off another site Steam keeps blocking with a Four-Pack for $2.49, completely worth it. I did however buy the Collectors Edition to show my support for this beautiful game. But enough bantering, here's the Game in a Nutshell.\n\nMECHANICS\nDungeon Defenders 2 plays like a Tower Defense with a complete twist of Four characters you play in 3rd person, all with their own Abilities and Towers, Strengths and Weaknesses. Your 4 Heroes are The Apprentice (WHY NOT CALL IT THE MAGE?), Squire (AGAIN, WHY NOT CALL IT A KNIGHT?), Huntress, and Monk. All have their own good Synergies with the other Heroes.\n\nThe Apprentice is a good Form of DPS, Squire is a Tank, Huntress makes Traps that Synergize well with all other Heroes, and the Monk uses Buffs and Debuffs for your Team.\n\nENDGAME\nThis game probably has a lot of Life ahead of it, despite being in Alpha for a year, the Devs listen to their Community, and have made the Game extremely long for anyone looking to do a Completionist run on it.\n\nOVERALL REVIEW\nThis game is Beautifully made, but make sure you have a good enough computer for it, sometimes the particles can make your game lose framerate. All in all, buy the game, either on Steam to support them or get the Value price of 2.49 on a site steam keeps blocking, which I recommend. 11/10 would buy four pack again on a site that Steam keeps blocking because the site sells games for very low prices and is trusted...

Dungeon Defenders 2 is a far cry from a sequel to do it justice.  While 2 does have its few improvements, most of what they have tried to do and the changes they have made just fall well short of 1.\n\nI do have to say that I PAID for early access and now this game has become Free To Play which I think is not at all a good thing.  Cheated with no reward.\n\nComparisons of 1 and 2:\n-The size, scale, and scope of the levels are very dissapointing compared to 1.  The maps are small wiith no real options for strategy, just put down big towers and hit the mobs as soon as they exit the doors or just barricading the crystal.  Towers seem too big and bulky on most maps.\n-Character depth and selection is so much less than 1.  Why do so many changes and break a great stat and equipment system?  Less skills, less stats, less customization, less options, big part of what made 1 great which is gone in 2.\n-Sloppy developement in a lot of ways.  Parts of the game, which were disabled from early beta, have just been abandoned in place, or left not working and broken.  Glaring glitches, major errors, updates that break the game, cumbersome control and gameplay (ex. can't use controller due to faulty button mappping on programmer side), major lag and sluggishness on normal game operations and loading which suggests a bare minimum approach to developement.\n\nI would say that they have a long way to go before this early access build is anything like Dungeon Defenders 1.  I don't feel the experience is anywhere near as good.  While I would love to help develope this game towards that direction, I don't think Trendy's direction is a good one at the moment.\n\n","February 11","false","97.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","2"

Hands down, the hardest part of this game is other people. You can't throw down your towers without reason, you have to communicate(esp. for Hard-mode), and plan out a "strategy" which at the moment is basically Lightning aura/Gyser/Ice Tower and a Boost aura(there are other combos that work of course). Sure you can add on some towers that synergise with those as well, but that is the core layout that many people are running. (Squire - cannon/Apprentice- earth are the best additions)\n---Edit: They fixed a bug with lightning aura, so it's not as op now. However, the gyser/lightning is still a strong combo.\n\nFurthermore,  I'm glad they're willing to make changes, I wouldn't want just a reskinned DD1. Because lets face it, if you want DD1, play DD1. Any re-skin they do will always pale in comparison to nostalgia. As for me, I'm loving where they seem to be going, and hope they implement new ideas that make DD2 look like, what DD1 wanted to be.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTowers/Classes -\n\nWith all the negative things being said, I still think having synergy between towers is a plus. Yes, it does somewhat limit gameplay at the moment, but, it creates some purpose to playing with other classes/using various towers together. it just needs some tweeks in the way it's implemented atm. Remember, Pre-alpha.\n\nCurrently, I can think of 1-2 optimal builds for a map/character(excluding legendaries that buff certain towers and may make them very valuable). that's extreemly boring in the long run, and limits the replayablility of the game.\n\n*More towers, combos, and specable talents would open this up some, because currently the Meta for a good team-based build seems to be -\n\nApprentice? Max the ice towers chance to freeze, place ice towers\nMonk? Max lightning aura dmg, place lightning aura's and boost aura's\nHuntress? Max the dmg the next atk does to a doused target. Or, If you want to go single target dmg, Dmg+ for target dist./ AA Full charge chance. Either way, place gysers.\nSquire? (haven't played squire, so no idea) Cannons are rediculous, as are balistas.\n\n\n\n----So, why do I reccomend the game?----\n\nIt has potential, a lot of potential. Remember, this is Pre-Alpha. They're still working out the kinks, and adding in a ton more content, this game, as is, is the foundation with a skeletal structure for what's to come, and it's shaping up very nicely. At the moment, it's meh. Not amazing, but not worth a thumbs down. IMO the game looks a lot more promissing than DD1, it both looks better, and has a more intuitive UI in place. I'm loving it so far.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSuggestions for the game -\n\n. More than 4 towers per character. But you can only chose 4 to bring into a map.\n. Improve lvl'ing experience. The game really starts 15+ when you have all your towers, but takes a while to get to depending on solo/group play.\n. Lower chances for green chests. . . 1 non-green chest in ~70-80 runs is rediculous, and it was a blue.\n. Item Drop chance not dependent on # of players in the map, but on difficulty of the map. . .\n. Stat re-roll option for items. (i.e. Changing M.Def -> def)\n. More Weapon options.\n. Clan option in-game\n. Improved UI/Overlay\n. Improved Matchmaking\n. lvl25+/++ and all challenge modes should only be able to be played by 1 of your characters, no Hero Deck option, unless in private play.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTL;DR -\nThis is not DD1. If you're dissapointed it's not just like DD1, play DD1. . . but you'll be missing out.\n\nTL;DR V.(Patch 1.1 Pre-Alpha)  -\nThumbs neutral, at the moment it's ok, but has a lot more potential than DD1 IMO. Hardest part of the game is learning to communicate, and strategize. They made multiplayer mean something, so don't be a 1-man army in a group of 4.\n\n\n\n----Currently 7/10,\ncould easily be 9/10 - 10/10 with some minor tweaks by Launch.\n\nIf you're on the fence, waitlist it, hopefully the upcoming improvements will push you over the edge =P\n\nIf not, it'll be Free-To-Play upon full release. . . whenever that is.","December 12, 2014","true","80.5"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","25","45","0","0"

The games scaling does get a little weird first two maps you are doing pretty well against the waves then all of a sudden you get to your 3 map and BAM it hits you. The learning curve is kinda weird for this game but once you have it down it the game curve seems to smooth out a lot. The new sphere system is really cool and i REALLY hope they expand more on it than it is right now because it is extremely small and the uber spheres seem to be a little lengthy in obtaining.\n\nLong story short the game is fun, game curve is a little weird, talent system is pretty decent, item upgrade system which i didnt mention sucks due to the amount of gold and gear you need to sink into it, another thing i didnt mention is how cool the combos are but sometimes in higher level stuff they feel really needed and you cant do high level content without them.

This second one does a fantastic job building on what was great. Keeping what made it successful, yet deepening the gameplay, and setting itself up to become a very successful and long lasting experience.\n\nI've played the Pre-alpha so far, these days with so many Early Access floating around on steam, very few are actually entertaining for long periods of time and don't portray a very good picture of what the end product will be like.\n\nAfter purchasing it (based on the gameplay I've seen, and my experience of the first game) I read up on some of the difficulties the Studio faced, and as a member of a fellow game studio, I can understand their struggles, but I also commend them for making the right decisions to make the game they want to make for their fans.\n\nWhat I didn't know was that DD2 is intended to become a Free-to-play game. Even though I bought into it (with a 4 pack) which I think will work really well if done correctly, and it sounds like they got their heads on straight.\n\nI fully intend to cover this game in my future video guides, as I feel there may be enough depth to the game to make regular videos for fans.\n\nBut one tip I can share right off the bat: PLAY WITH FRIENDS. It is infinitely more enjoyable, especially if you're around the same level. The matchmaking system is probably still in the works, so do yourself the favour, and don't expose yourself to potential malicious players who could ruin your experience.

The story line is dull, and lacks the content that everybody loved so much about the first Dungeon Defenders. Overall, I am satisfied with DD2.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daikaze/recommended/236110/","daikaze","Patches","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daikaze/","327 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's not a great game and honestly it's a step back from the original. However, DunDefToo does grow on you a bit. Finding rare loot and pets feels nice... but loot is so overabundant that you stop caring about anything that isn't mythic/legendary. The game has an auto-collection feature but it doesn't let you choose what is collected/left behind. This means you gotta sift through the garbage to make sure you didn't miss a pet or pet food (they don't have an indicator on the screen/map to make them easy to track).\n\nThe maps are all super boring, small, and mostly tight spaces. This is problematic because players and towers have collisions on them. So, the game gets crowded very quickly.\n\nPlayers get their own mana (currency for making/repairing/upgrading defenses) each round and it scales based on the player count. This is pretty nice and you can hand it off to the other players. Sadly, the game is totally anti-social. A single player can (like the first game) change their character to place additional defenses. The players also have a shared point limit for placing defenses. So, most of the time you either put up with bad placements or a single player doing everything. Basically, the game stops being tower defense and more about doing nothing or going combat focused (killing things yourself). This was a problem in the first game as well, but those maps were usually laid out in a way that a combat player still retained value.\n\nThe pet system is god awful. You need special materials to "evolve" your pets... this sounds cool, but you need a resource called "shellium" which is obtained by letting pet eggs expire. This means you have to give up the chance at an interesting pet for some resources... and it takes 48 hours of sitting in your inventory to expire. Pets occupy their own special bag space, but eggs take up normal bag slots. Leveling up pets requires food... food does not stack with itself and therefore takes up extra bag space. The eggs can be hatched instantly between matches (in the tavern after you reach a certain level), but the timers could change. The timers used to be 8 hours and you can only hatch one at a time.\n\nSo, your inventory will consist of the following:\n* Garbage items for upgrades/selling\n* Eggs\n* Cosmetic item boxes (requires premium or daily quests to open)... you'll get a lot of these.\n* Quality items (so you can use a different build.\n* Pet Food\n* Pet Food\n* Pet Food\n\nIf you want to get materials to upgrade pets then you'll spend even more space on eggs.\n\nWhat the game sells for a premium:\n* Character slots (5$) - you get enough for each class at leas\n* Bags - 2-5$ depending on the size of the bag\n* Pet Bags - 2-3.5$ depending on the extra space you want\n* Costumes - 10$ or more for costumes\n* Pet Skins - 2$ or more depending on the costume\n\nAt first glance the game seemed pretty fair (monetization-wise)... but with the inventory problems and sheer cost of space it began to feel greedy. Like they sacrificed usability to sell more things.\n\n\nPhysics/Networking:\nSo, the game is prolly hosted on a server rather than on the leader's system. This wouldn't be so bad, but the game's server is authoritative and the client has to obey. This means rubberbanding, or worse, the server sends you flying forward because it didn't notice that you had stopped. This means that input lag exists... and it's pretty awful. It's like they built the game on an old-school architecture without realizing that there are superior options.\n\nThe game has large, blocky, collisions for everything. The characters slide (prolly input lag) around and so it's not uncommon to throw yourself off of a cliff. When your character attacks they move a little bit and the animation can't be canceled. This again, leads to the feeling of input lag (this is animation related rather than server related though). Basically, ranged attacks function better than melee attacks.\n\nBottom line:\nIt's a skinner box disguised as a game... a game with poor physics and networking. While it's free-to-play it has a lot of greedy elements hidden in there.","October 14, 2015","false","24.6"," 81 of 154 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","81","154","5","0"

It's literally impossible to find a group through matchmaking anywhere else.\n\nJoin a group, watch one guy build all the towers and then sit around doing nothing while you wait for loot.

But once you've figured out a working setup, it's still just a matter of building the towers and waiting for the enemies to die, then doing it over and over exactly the same hundreds of times until you have all the best loot and nothing left but to wait for a patch to bring some new tier of gear.\n\nMany many people have mentioned these issues on the official forums.

However, when you first start off playing the game, you are met with utter confusion. The first maps start off as hard as most maps were half way through the game in the first game. By the way I reached the third or fourth map; It had four places where monsters kept pouring out, and the items I were to defend were placed in a haphazard manner. The maps are in general just poorly designed in comparison to the first game.\n\nSo, right from the start; This game is impossible to play alone to get a hang of it. So you are forced to play with people online, which I figured is the way it's supposed to be played, of course. Well, it would have made a bit more sense to let a person who is new to the game actually start off in a brand new game, and not throw the poor player into a group that is already half-way through the map, leaving you unable to build any towers. So you stand alone in the onslaught, doing no damage, simply waiting to get your free loot.\n\nAlso, throwing all the leveling info, stats, customization, and everything of the sort ALL AT THE SAME TIME, is extremely daunting and off-putting. Slowly introducing mechanics to new players would be extremely helpful, since most info you get is either too detailed or not detailed at all.\n\nIt's not a terrible game by all means. But it would at most get 4 out of 10, where the original DD would easily get 8 out of 10. If it was as simple to learn as its predecessor, the game would have been better in general. But the useless stats thrown around, no proper info or pointers given, poor optimization, and the maps being completely rubbish in comparison to the first game, does make it feel extremely lackluster.","January 10","false","51.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This game is very much worse than the first Dungeon Defenders. It just does not offer much in comparison but since it is free (open alpha), feel free to try it out yourself.\n\nI personally enjoyed this game a fair bit.\nThis game was also very fun playing with friends and theory crafting strategies for beating maps we were having trouble on. Figuring out the most effective/efficient tower placements made it quite fun the first time around.\n\nAfter the initial 50 hours I started to grow quite boring and tedious to do anything and everything.\nThe journey of getting your first max level character (level 50 at this point in time) is probably the most fun I've had in this game. Getting to max level and grinding out for the best gear you can and then replacing it instantly after climbing to the next Nightmare difficulty becomes less and less rewarding and feels like more of a chore.\n\nWith everything I've said, this game is fairly fun for the first 30-50 hours.\nIn that time you can:\n-Learn about the classes\n-You can reach max level on a character or two (or 3 if you're really diligent)\n-Learn about every map\n\nF I N A L   V E R D I C T\nAll the maps are given to you and you can play them all before you ever reach max level.\nThere is no real reward to reaching max level besides being able to start the Nightmare difficulties which are just a pain the butt and offer nothing new besides identitcal weapons with better overall stats.\nYou get the feeling of "Oh great now I get to grind the same maps but its even harder...woop dee friggin' doo"\n\nI give it a rating of 6/10 and I'm listing it as a positive review because I did indeed have a lot of fun.

However even though being a sequel this game couldn't be more diffrent. As a veteran in DD1 and DDE I'll have to say this game isnt the same, but that doesn't make the game less fun. Everthing has been reworked from Enemies all the way to Heros. Heros have gotten new Abillitys and Towers, however keeping the old themes of the Heros. As of now the 4 basic Heros and Series EV have been brough back along side an all new Character the Abyss Lord. The Abyss Lord is a rework a the old Summoner.\nDifficulty curve in this game is alot diffrent aswell. Still featuring Easy to Nightmare, however Nightmare 1 to 4 each being more difficult.\nSomething verteran players will notice over the course of the game is that Item stats have been changed alot. Instead of featuring upto 10 stats, Items will now feature 3 stats and upto 3 passives. Also not to mention the Defense Speed stat has been removed from items and can only be skilled with Stat points from leveling up.\n\nDD2 is somewhat recommendable to old veterans.\n\nReview for all new Players to Dungeon Defenders\nDungeon Defenders 2 is a 4 player cooperative Tower Defense RPG. Unlike most Tower Defense games you do not just sit arround and watch your towers defend, no you actually get to make a diffrence yourself with your Heros.\nThis game features 5 diffrent heros (more to come) each being unique in their own way.\nThe story of this game has an playtime of about 50 hours. However the overall game has an playtime of over 400 hours.\nAfter completing the Story your hunt to reach the highest level and Item Power begins in order to take part the the most difficult challenges of the game.\nThis game features a very balanced loot system that almost always ends up with you finding better items. However grinding gear is still a thing.\nDD2 does feature mircrotransactions to keep the game alive however they are just cosmetic.\n\nKeep in mind that this game is in Alpha (at the point of this review) and alot of features in this game a subject to change. I'll keep my opinion on the game updated as updates come and go.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to anyone who loves Tower Defenses.","June 5","true","501.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I could stare hours into the beautiful landscapes and also write hours about it ;)\n\nBalance/Bugs/Ingame Currency\n-> Trendy constantly adds new content to the game, so they can have all features they want as quickly as possible, but this also results in a lot of bugs. The worst bugs get fixed quickly. The balance issues are not that bad in early stages of the game, but in the endgame there are only a few viable towers/characters. I´m sure the balance will get fixed, since most of the old characters will get reworked soon to be as good as the new ones. The ingame currency is fine. You can get some skins and additional inventory slots with it, but nothing that would give you an advantage in the game.\n\nGameplay:\n- A lot of variation in maps, difficulties, items and characters. You can even equip spheres to boost your character to the max. or take a pet to help you in battle\n- Tons of enemies, each with their own strengths and some with special abilitiess\n- The normal gamemode is nice and balanced and will take you a good amount of time to reach the last difficulties.\n- The second gamemode is named "onslaught" and is basically an endless mode. The gamemode is fun but does not provide good rewards at the end. I´m sure they will make some work on this gamemode soon.\n- The third and last gamemode is named "incursion" and is a much harder version of the map you choose. The gamemode is very challenging and is okey so far. But they currently work on adding a different task for each map and a unique reward if you win. There is already one map with this concept and i´m very happy with it.\n- Daily missions/monthly missions have good rewards and are well done.\n- Characters all have their own playstyle and look.\n\nI could write on for hours, because there is so much more to talk about, but i wanted to keep it short and just give you an idea of the current state of the game!\n\n\nResult:\n-> The fantastic graphics, love to details and the variety of characters, pets, enemies and maps, make this one of my favorite games. I spent over 440 hours on this game so far and don´t regret anything. The Trendy team is friendly and listens to the community. Constant patches with new characters, challenges, maps and much more keep the game interesting and fun. Just keep in mind that the game is in development and still contains some bugs and balance issues, but overall I can totally recommend you to test it out yourself, you won´t regret it!!","June 4","true","442.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/choondoge/recommended/236110/","choondoge","chinny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/choondoge/","89 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTo be quite honest, I DO RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR THOSE WHO HAVE PLAYED DD1 AND LOVED IT. It's great, but there are multiple problems that you would commenly expect when getting a pre-alpha game. Ignoring the fact that I have down voted this game, there are multiple aspects of this game that include DD1 gameplay style and newly intergrated styles in this new game.\n\nNow for the main reasons I have (not) recommended this game.\n\n- A lot of the features of DD1 have been removed/rehased/recycled. This means that some of the things have been kept, while some of these things have been reworked, while most of the other stuff has been reused.\n\n-Style of the game is great, it is visualy appealing and very well textured/graphics are amazingly good for a pre-alpha.\n\n- A lot of the classes have been reworked and nerfed heavily. Huntress's mines/traps and bombs area of effect has been greatly nerfed had has no were near the the effect they did in DD1. Squire's defences are while the same, have been heavily nerfed, and dont hold a candle to DD1's squire's defences. Monk and Apprentice are in the same boat, thus making the game a lot more difficult and challenging when progressing onwards in leveling. Defences are also quite weak, and you're forced to rely on your hero to do most of the cleaning of waves.\n\n-Mana: Mana has been drastically altered and is no longer the main currency of the game. While you still use mana to build towers and use abilities, the new incorperation of a coin/gold system is now the new money of the game. Speaking of mana, there are two different types of mana. Ability mana (Blue) and Tower mana (Green) both drop off enemies, but in very LOW quantites.\n\n-Online system: They have a very strange working of the Online/Server set up which at first greatly confused me. However it took a while to get use to. You are thrown into a recruitment tavern where you talk to a recruiter. This brings up a menu allowing you to pick from multiple different level groups. E.g. 1-5. 5-10. 10-15. This also stops boosting somewhat as if you were a higher level, (E.g. 15) and joined a lower level bracket, (E.g. 5-10), you would be brought down to level 10 for the remainer of your time in that bracket, once you leave, you are returned to your normal level. This also kicks lower level characters from trying to join higher level brackets.\n\nOverall, the game is very different from DD1. I was expecting it to be a lot better than the first one, and wasn't expecting much of the workings of the characters to change that much considering they were perfect in the first game. However this is my opinion and that doesn't mean much on the internet.\n\nThe main reason I am not recommending this game is becuase it's purely a pre-alpha and the the fact that its $24, (from New Zealand), is not really ideal. However, in another case, if you loved DD1 and want to give it a try, by all means, i would recommend it to you just becuase its a great start to a game that has LOADS of potential. However, definately needs work, and lots of changes.\n\n~~TLDR~~\nIf you liked DD1, get it and see for yourself. If you haven't played DD1 or didn't like DD1, don't get it, becuase it's simply not worth $24 or whatever its going for in your country. Especially when rumour has it that on offical release its going to go Free 2 Play.","January 19, 2015","false","18.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(And it's only on early access! Imagine when it's fully released!)\n\n~PROS~\n-Better Graphics (LMFAO wHo cAREAS Xd seriously.)\n-Characters are more customizable with the new accessory patch!\n-The new sphere skill tree is better than dd1's skill point system imo. + UBER SPEC !!! (game-changing spec for each classes towers.)\n-4 HERO ABILITIES COMPARED TO DD1'S 2 HERO ABILITY.\n-The world is more interactive (Pre-Set Traps!)\n-Class COMBOES! water + electric = electrocute? oil + fire = ignite? yes please!\n\n~CONS~\n-The towers are BOOORING. I miss the bowling ball turret from DD1 T_T\n-BUGS GLITCH BUGS GLITCH (But it's okay, since its only Pre-Alpha.\n-NEED MORE HEROES!\n-Some Spec is just utter 5H!T AND USELESS. MORE CHARACTER SPEC PLZ!!!\n-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI GETS STUCK AND IT PISSES ME OFF! (Could be exploited too, but what fun would that be?)\n\nOverall, the game's progess is looking REAAAAL good. I was skeptical about buying it first, but then Trendy really showed me their hard work on making this game, even convincing me to buy the collector's edition (DAMMIT TRENDY!)\n\n9/10.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND PLAYING THIS WITH YOUR FRIENDS! Soloing is possible, but it gets BOOORING REAL FAST, but if you play this game with your friends (4 stack if possible) it is just simply AMAZING.\n\n<3 u Trendy, keep up the good work!\n\n-Popon","May 6, 2015","true","183.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It runs rather well, I have expirienced very few to no bugs at all and the Devs are quick to fixing any that happen to pop up. The classes are all fairly balanced in their own ways and they're all able to be built about 2-3 different ways, which adds some more diversity to the game itself.\n\nThat being said, it is till only in Alpha stage so there is a rather large limit to most of the game's features at the moment. After completing the Campagin mode you're left with Free mode and a newer insane mode, which both become repetitive and annoying at times, especially with having only so many maps to play.\n\nGood news is that the community is alot kinder than most and if you don't mind replaying maps here and there it can become addicting, and one hell of a lootfest. With the many ways of playing classes and spending 8 hours a day waiting for the damn eggs to hatch just one legendary pet to admire; you'll get alot of time into it. It's also possible to play singleplayer, if you're the anti-social type or just don't have any friends.\n\nAll in all, it's a fairly good game for being in Early access, and there's clearly alot more coming to the game. So if you don't mind the repetitive gameplay and watching the game grow, then this is for you. If you'd rather get the full expirience then go ahead and wait, either way this certainly is, and most likely will be a wonderful game upon full release.","September 22, 2015","true","89.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

As far as I can see those folks didn't even play the game enough to make such harsh reviews of the game, they simply give up after having to do some grind, which is sad cuz the game is very promising and fun.\n\nTo begin with I must say that I never did any review about an early-access or beta/alpha games, but well ... like they say : there is always a first time.\n\nSo here we go. The first Dungeon Defenders games come out a couple of years ago, and I never had a chance or time to try them out on that time. Just this year I had a chance to play it and without any surprises I immediately loved it.\n\nAfter getting all the collection I decided to also buy the upcoming Dungeon Defenders II, which is currently on alpha (I probably will update this review later), but for now the game is running really GOOD, So good that doesn't even feel like an early-access, As you can notice I got tons of hours already, that's all because the game hook you in, lots of fun playing solo or online, and will be even better when this goes F2P, cuz all your friends will be able to play it without spend a cent.

I have played DD but not DDE.\nThis review is also written from Pre-Alpha.

(sometimes too much?)\n+Keeps the cartoon style of DD1 but slim and tall instead of short and stalky\nBias+ I enjoy the pet system of having to hatch your pet from an egg, feels more of a pet than equipment\nCons:\n-Still early access ofc\n-Premium currency? even if it isn't P2W so far (It is looking like $1 = 100 runes and cheapest skins are 400, 800, and 1600 runes so skins are not extremely expensive and a nice way to support the devs)\n-Once you get about the last 5 campaign lvls its hard to find people playing them in MM\n-You have to finish campaign before dailies/monthly (this is only con because its hard to find people for last 5 missions)\n\nConclusion:\nBuy this game if you're interested and have the money. If it is on sale just buy it you'll enjoy at least a few hrs of play.\n\nThis game is still in Pre-Alpha which for most games out there it looks pretty much done. For full price of $24.99 It is worth the 11hrs I've played so far. (The week I write this it is on mid-week madness sale of $15) The only bugs I've really had to deal with in my hrs of play is the Drakins will get stuck on small senery and they update almost every time I want to play :P\nEdit: After about 20-30 minutes of posting this review I had a DEV! comment. A++ they're asking players how the game is and getting our feedback to know how to make it better. I can no longer recomend this game more now.

Some towers in the game have combinations but the squire class seems to have been left out of this equation - something I hope the developers are planning on addressing.\n\nLoot is more fair in this title, in the previous game loot was dropped and visible to all players, this would lead to a mad scramble as everyone abandoned their posts to try and snatch the loot before someone else. In Dungeon Defenders 2, loot is instanced (players can only see their own loot) and means that people focus more on the battle than watching for a nice drop. Nice drops are also alerted to so people don't have to stare at the map all the time.\n\nHowever a lot of the game is still missing, I'd like to see:\n* More bosses\n* Improved pet system\n* Higher level cap (as content comes)\n* More game modes\n* Balanced uber spec spheres\n* A way of selling unused spec spheres\n* More adventure maps\n","May 14, 2015","true","83.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

I am jsut glad i dont have to deal with all those crazy hacks and mods i feel like were rampant on the first game.\n\nFor those not familiar with Dungeon Defenders, you chose your hero and battle waves of enemy's in tower defense gameplay with up to four friends. Dungeon Defenders has a good deal of classes to chose, but so far in Dungeon Defenders 2 we only have the 4 original to chose from, those being the Huntress, squire, monk, and apprentice.\n\nReally I am hoping that Dungeon Defenders 2 ends up better than the first game.

As it stands, the game plays very similar to the first, with some minor changes. So far it seems to be living up to the greatness that was Dungeon Defenders 1.\n\nUnderstand that because it is early access, I know a lot of my concerns with the game will be fixed, and I will update my review when that happens.\n\nPros/Cons:\n\n+ The AI seems to be smarter, and more dificult than those in the first game.\n+ The ability to move your hero while in place/repair/upgrade defense mode is amazing.\n+ The Dual Mana system is also an awesome addition. You now have mana for abilities, and a separate mana for towers.\n+ The new defenses each hero has are either upgrades from the first game, or new all together, which is good.\n+ The ability to vote for the next addition into the game is an awesome early access feature, and should be done more often by developers.\n- The gear upgrade system is lacking, and confusing at first.\n- There has yet to be added a proper tutorial system for new features.\n- The small amount of maps gets old quite fast, and the game tends to get boring after a bit.\n- Costumes and pets are nowhere to be found, and is one of the things that made the first game a favorite.\n- The gear shops are barely useful, as the only reason I use them is to get junk gear to upgrade my current stuff.\n\nAll in all, the game is damn good, and can only get better from here.","February 15, 2015","true","16.1"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

I'll explain why below.)\n\nPros\n- Personal loot drops make for a more relaxed game where you don't have to constantly keep your eyes out for drops you need (There's no more race to grab the good loot before other players and that is a great design call)\n- The classes have some really cool attacks and abilities making each feel unique\n- Changes to mana and loot selling have made things much easier, both for sorting through loot and for upgrading it\n- Seperation of mana for building and for personal powers was a great call\n- Easy group finding system gets you right into the action\n- Reputation system makes random players more inclined to be polite\n- Synergy system means you can make powerful tower combinations if you have a cooperative team of players.\n\nCons\n- Can't play offline\n- Long lags between games.  Due to the fact that a game has no clear leader, everyone has to ready up for the game to progress between levels and after the games.  This doesn't sound too bad, but when people go afk or someone new isn't paying attention, it can end up being 2+ minutes to continue on\n- Solo, each classes tower set is lacking (I'll explain more about this below)\n- A lack of mana will prevent you from doing much during a combat round (at least at low level)\n- The win points and fun-factor strategies to this game aren't as obvious as they were in the original\n- Builder specs feel very nerfed thanks to the lack of mana (EDIT: Again, this is only when you don't try to work with the other player's towers)\n- Maps are a bit bland, there aren't as many strategic points where you can put towers to have them cover multiple lanes\n- Tower synergies are esential to effective play\n- Certain specs are almost completely useless right now\n- Gating low-level players means that you can't power level your buddies.  It also means that, if your buddies get too far ahead, you can't play with them unless you make a new character.\n- Certain monsters outrange your towers.  I'm not sure if this changes at high level, but at low level it's extremely frustrating.  It means that you'll be babysitting your towers instead of being able to place them in different spots and trust them to do their job.\n- Due to the fact that you have to babysit your tower clumps, you cannot solo most of the levels (At least as an apprentice)\n\nSo I went back and started playing as the monk with a friend who was playing the huntress, and I quickly figured out a pretty devistating combo that made the game much more playable.  I also figured out that one of my mages towers, while not super impressive when combined with his original towers, was extremely effective when combined with one of the monk's auras.\n\nSo it seems the devs are really pushing for cooperative gameplay in this one, the game almost feels more like WoW than it does Dungeon Defenders.  To be successful, each player must assume a certain role in their tower construction.  A group of apprentice towers isn't very effective, however an ice tower combined with an electric aura (monk) combined with a water geyser (hunter) is devastating.  The concept is fun when it works out, the big problem is that new players or stubborn players will often build whatever they want, effectively lowering your chances of success.  I feel like this sort of design choice needs to be combined with a matchmaking system that tries to put one of each class in a game together.  (Maybe this is already the design, I don't know, but I was often in games with several members of my own class.)\n\nThe good news is, I did start having a lot of fun once I figured out how the devs expected me to play.  However, I had to do a lot of digging to find that answer.  The game needs to guide its new players better so they know what's needed for victory and don't just build whatever, therebye frustrating the other people who are trying to work as a team.\n\nAlso, the game needs more towers and more tower synergies.  As of this review, there is one devastating tower/aura/trap combination and everything else is very meh.  Certain towers are very meh and pretty much un-needed.  This needs to be changed so that there are multiple metas (tower building combinations) showing up in the games instead of just 1 or 2.\n\nIn closing, the game is fun but very different from the first Dungeon Defenders.  You'll have the most fun when playing with friends, and you may want to watch some videos on how to effectively use your towers depending on your class.\n\n* Update\nSo the game changes quite a bit at high level.  Once you get your gear established and start the process of farming, you pretty much only need one skilled builder (generally an apprentice or squire) to do the tower setup for the level.  To be honest, it is kind of grindy and not always fun.  And while finding new items to improve your stats can be fun, the actual gameplay isn't.  This may change once more maps are available and harder difficulties are provided.  I'm going to keep my recommendation for now as the game isn't bad and still has potential, but I'm really looking for some new kinds of juicy cooperative gameplay.","December 7, 2014","true","587.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

I especially liked that they separated building mana and ability mana so you aren't put in a position of being restricted from using abilities because you have to save up mana to upgrade every tower to the highest rank.  Their new rune system is nice as well to add some customization in terms of passive abilities.  The only down side that I can think of is that if you were one to completely neglect one stat and focus on others (i.e who needs health and attack when I plan on just using the character for towers?  Or vice versa.)  That you will still collect gear that has stats which affect them, but the stat bonus when gaining a level has been steamlined.  I personally don't mind it, but I do know there were people who would have multiple versions of the same character, one for building and one for combat.  One other feature that is nice is that the enemies per wave seem to be no longer dependent upon the number of players, thus the probability of someone booting you because they don't want more bad guys to fight per wave is no longer an issue.","May 27, 2015","true","268.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great gameplay, extremely rare to come across bugs. Very nice and helpful community both in the game and on the forums. I'm guessing the old generation plays these kinds of games, I rarely meet any kids.\n\nEverything runs extremely smoothly with graphics and whatnot, I would however wish they made it harder to level in the future, and do the drops for rare loot even more rare, it's easy to get good gear atm, or at least that's how I feel.\n\nEasily worth the price, even with the low game-time I have.

For the players familiar with DD1 it's a feast of recognition and for those new into the world of "hybrid FPS combined with tower defenses" there's a tutorial and campaign easing you into the game.\nAt the moment of this writing there's only 4 characters available, the same foursome from the original. But in true spirit the characters have aged a bit and no longer look like grade-school Southpark aged characters but more like teenagers. Quite a nice detail giving you the feeling of story progression.\nThe game is still defend a crystal (see it as a homebase) from getting damaged by angry enemies. You can do this actively by killing them with your hero (the FPS element) or using your heroes defenses, arrow shooting towers, explosive traps auras and walls/barriers.\nNot all is quite finished yet. The way xp evolves at the moment is still a bit unbalanced the same if you compare the ratio of hero damage versus the damage traps/towers do. At the moment there's lots of ways to share your feedback via the forum and the developers seems to take the feedback into account.\nIt's not a finished gem yet, but from what I can tell it plays a lot better than plenty of other "beta games" available on steam now.\nSo if you can live with a few issues and enjoy playing either solo (doable) or with friends (co-op) then this can be a fun game","August 6, 2015","true","610.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The dungeons are quite challenging later on and the skills still have a nice impact. You can feel your character growing in power with each upgrade.

I bought every single bit of game changing content the previous Dungeon Defenders had, and loved the characters all the way. This dungeon defenders, though? It's a breed bought in microcontent and not even close to the original's quality. I am willing, nay eager, to pay $30-40 for a sequel - but I refuse to pay for gems, points, or widgets to make a lackluster base engine shine enough to make this work. From my play experience, I swear, it's like they farmed out design and even sensibility to a foreign country for cutthroat rates. I haven't spent a dime on the sequel, but I'm willing to chip in a fiver to pay for the tombstone of tedium for this developer group.","January 4","false","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

After a couple emails and sending them a crash report, the response I received was that I was basically S.O.L. and that I would have to wait for a full release version for them to fix my problem. I'm pretty disappointed in this response.

You will have to exit the entire game and relog in to fix it.	♥♥♥♥♥♥ server coding that makes you use so much bandwidth to access any games it actually borks itself and makes you get a connection issue even after you are in the game. You can also get a match making error that pops up when you try to leave a party. So...yes. You get a connection issues for leaving the server host? ha. When you are in a game and change characters it has a random occurance to kick you out and tell you your login session expired and you have to restart the game to play. It will also do this on other occurances that tell you someone else is logged into your account. Sometimes your spheres won't equip and the network inconsistency makes it so you have to try and try until it works. When you switch characters some of the previous models will be stuck inside the other characters.\nThere are a million problems with this game yet content is being released over the absolute nonexistence of server stability. For a game on unreal you would expect it to run better, but no. No it doesn't. Needless to say there is alot of content to observe! This is the kind of roller coaster of a game where it's so fun you go again even though the sick guy in the front keeps puking all over everyone. when you are ending a map and getting the chest if you change characters it has a 3in5 chance to randomely kill you.","March 11","false","214.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

It's one of the most played games on my Steam account. I've only played a little bit of the sequel so far, but man, I am struggling to find any enjoyment in it.\n\nThe structure is mind-boggling. The focus on online/social taverns, extremely limited quick match options with no server browser, having to load back into the tavern in between every map in the campaign? What are the developers thinking? Forcing everyone to be online all the time and giving us no control over who we match up with leads to every game being half full of afk players or max level characters who are wiping the floor with the low level maps for some reason.\n\nAt least when playing solo in a private game, I finally get to stop and look at the maps and use some strategy. But even then if I exit out of a map and try to do another one, I run into errors saying that I have made too many matchmaking attempts recently and to wait a few minutes. Can't even play the game alone. Thanks Trendy.\n\nI cannot recommend this game at all in its current state. If a loot and stat-based tower defense/action game sounds appealing to you, I would highly suggest playing the first game instead.","January 16","false","3.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

I would have gladly paid $60 for a better experience. I recall annoucements that you would only be able to pay for asthetic items, nothing that would make the game easier. Well you have to pay to have more than 4 heroes and pay for more inventory. I personally am not dumping in the money pit. As far as content goes, only 4 heroes(which is understandable with early acess), but who knows if you would have to pay for some hero packs when those come out. Tower changes for each class which is refreshing. Not that i didn't like the old towers but something new like that is good. Maps are terrible. There is no challenge on a build. The enemy paths are so short that you could literally build anywhere and win. Armor does not show up on your hero, so you will buy costumes. Again, i would have gladly paid money for the game to have that capability and avoid a money pit. Costumes, as of right now, aren't that great. A couple of good ones for a couple heroes. Huntress costumes are garbage in my opinion. Amount of content is lacking and bugs are present. I wouldn't expect anything else from even a game that was just realeased let alone an early access. The deciding factor for me is this has been in alpha for over a year. Seems like progress is going to be very slow considering they were working on it before it was released for early access. But don't worry, the money pits are up and functional so you can dump some money in. It is free to play so it's not like you are going to regret the decision to download, but not worth the time for me.","January 23","false","60.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It's about to go free to play (as intended) on October 13th. This game, blends together tower defence, and an arpg together into one game. You can play as a monk, a squire, a huntress, and an apprentice. With the hero deck system, you can swap between 4 characters (or more, if you buy the slots). Each hero has 4 abilities and 4 different tower types, and each hero has it's own specializations. Each of them feel unique and fun to play. The graphics, the art styles, and the soundtrack are all amazing. The gameplay itself is also really great, and I have yet to see any gamebreaking bugs even in this early alpha stage.\n\nPros:\n+ graphics\n+ sound\n+ gameplay\n+ loot/pets!\n+ classes/abilities\n+ Really fun to stratagize with friends!\n+ Steam integration\nCons:\n- Needs more weapon styles especially for Apprentice\n- Needs a better way to level 40 - 50 instead of grinding same map\n- Could use more maps/gamemodes (which I'm sure will be added)\n- Could possibly use an explanation for Hero Stats. (when I first started I had no idea what to focus on)\n- No trading system or player market yet\n\nIf you buy it before the 13th, your money will help develop this awesome game, and you'll get premium currency and other goodies. If you wait til it goes f2p, well, try the game out! It's very addicting and tons of fun.\nThanks for reading! :)","October 8, 2015","true","48.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Also only one inventory for all characters.\nTheir personal interface is buggy and doesn't run well with Steam at times; definetly needs work.\n\nI am one of the first to mention their prices but with their newest event the Carnival i am pleased to say they finally put in reasonable prices for the carnival tickets (don't get me started on that $48 skin though!!)\n\nI will say to new players, the community can be fickle but not inhospitable just be open to learning and listening.  If you come in and yell at builders for not letting you build instead of asking why, you're not going far trust me.\nAsk questions, read the forums and be patient, people will answer and help you.

In my opinnion for its current stage is a big improvement from DD1. Hopefully when its on its final release the anti-cheat will stop the hackers. Since it will be free.\n\nSo far I rate it 8/10.\n\nGreat game! Must buy if you got the cash!\n\n^ 12/13/2014\n------ Updated Review.\nNow for a better review as I have more game time.\n\nStraight off we will start yes this game is lacking some very needed functions or should I  say core elements for the game, as trading or even just to drop items in your tavern should be in but I am just going to leave that as it's still in Pre Alpha.\n\nAs you journey on playing the difficulty "Normal" on some levels if you are new or unexperienced, the levels seem to be some what difficult for someone new to the game. If you are playing alone that is. As again you are meant to play with people, More people more chance of bonus loot(better loot) 4 Players becomes a large chance of good loot.\n\nFrom DD1, I can say that the towers have been nerfed? That don't seem to feel do as much damage as I would rather expect.\n\nI was suprised when they had said there wasn't going to be PvP, slightly dissapointed but it isn't that much of a big deal as I got the game to play with friends.\n\nGraphics:\nIn my opinnion I think they are a lot better then the previous dungeon defenders and truly like the new graphcs! But again I miss the more cartoony side of the old DD not sure if that makes sense but can't really explain it. - Overall: 7.5/10\n\nMaps:\nGreat maps, so far loved all of them! each map is unique and some what different in a way wether your helping crystals or just a cart. Overall: 9/10\n\n\nAI:\nAI are great, so far there are some great monsters/enemys to verse in DD2, they have annouced there will be more enemys which is great and excited about that! overall: 6.5/10\n\nTowers:\nSo far I've played as Monk, Apprentice and Squire. From what my experiences have been the towers lack power as they had more power in DD1. other then that I really like the desings of some towers that are in the current DD2. Overall 5/10\n\nTaverns:\nIt can be quite confusing as there is an "Entry Tavern" and a "Private Tavern" (Not sure if there was a public tavern as I played in private groups) And going to the war recruiter is a bit annoying as if you have a player thats 1 level below the war recruiters you can't play, I guess it's to stop boosters? Eh overall: 6/10\n\nInventory:\nInventory is really basic at the moment all though, the "Temporary bag"(if your bags full it goes there) just seems to be endless and you can keep getting items not sure if that was intetnional or what. Inventory can be a bit buggy, you can purchase a "Small Bag" for $10,000 In-game Credits and a "Large Bag" for $50,000 In-Game credits. I am not sure if I like this or not, I haven't purchased one as I don't need it. But seems pretty cool. Each item you get can be transferred to other characters ( just stays in your inv) which is handy as same does your money transfers across, I am not sure what happened but a mate and I both got the game at the same time, played same time and he ended up with $40,000 and I had $13,000 but had collected close to same amount of coins laying around. Not sure what happened. Overall 8.5/10\n\nMoney system:\nI like how they approched this, insted of Mana being your currecny it's gold. Which is great!\nOverall: 8/10\n\nOverall:\nStill think with everything I have mentioned it is a fun game, and it is great to participate in the development of this game.\n\nRating:\n7/10\n\nWorth Buying?:\nYes and no. It all really depends on yourself. Do you want to support or just wait?\nIf you want to help development then sure go right ahead, but aside that there are a lot of bug's that will be fixed in the near future hopefully but still great game and I do personally think it's worth buying.","December 9, 2014","true","22.4"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","20","39","2","3"

I told myself I'd never pay again for early access and I stuck to my guns with that in regards to DD II. I'm glad I waited.\n\nI will start by describing what I have played so far to give you a point of view to read my thoughts from. I've played the game about 14 hours and have beat every map on the campaign on the starting hardness setting. I have a decent strategy on how to beat every map with using just the Mage. Normal difficulty or hard requires you have multiple characters leveled up to do physical damage.  I am almost level 30 and found a few good pets so far. The pet system is interesting. I like how you can get the eggs and hatch them but.... we are talking about RNG and the frustrations that come with it. I am always excited to see what the eggs turn into. So far the pets have been mostly crap. I did however get one legendary one and a few rares all of which do not have the stats I wish to have on them :( Don't think of pets as something which will make or break your character. It helps, but isn't going to determine your win/failure on a map.\n\nWhere are all the dang maps???? DD II has maybe 15 maps total as of 11/26/2015. Yes you can play the maps in different modes, wooo still the same dang maps. DD I had a ton of maps with the DLCs which were great and allowed for some interesting trap/field combinations.  DD II feels simplier, the only level which I feel has any difficulity to it is the Wyrvern Nest with Betsy on Easy. That was the first map I lost on during the campaign.  Above Easy hardness you need multiple characters or happen to play with someone who has a physical damage tower based hero.\n\nPros:\n+Free to Play: Awesome! Does it include free cake?\n+Tower Defense: Yes please, give me more!\n+Variety of Critters: a good amount and variety of monsters.\n+Evolving Pets: Who doesn't want to catch em all?\n+Tons of Loot!: You can find what you are looking for stat-wise fairly easily.\n+Getting loot 99% of the time for the character you are playing on: yes! thank you jeebus. It frustrated me to no end playing on X character in DD I and getting amazing items for other heros but not the hero I'm currently playing.\n\nNeutral:\n+/- Micro transactions: The amount of stuff you can spend premium currency on is a bit rediculous. Want to ensure the egg you are hatching evolves a certain way? Spend premium currency. Want cosmetics? Spend currency. Its not game-breaking, just let it be known you have many ways to spend premium currency.\n+/- Simplier: No leveling up 6 characters to utilize one or two things from a Monk and Knight and Mage while you are playing on X character for Y reason.\n\nCons:\n- Tons of Loot!: There is so much crap that drops it takes a good 5+ minutes to sort through it all after heading back.\n- I feel "meh" about it. Sure it kills time and takes strategy, but I could also not play it for 2 months and be completely fine with that. Its like I'm watching a movie I've seen a hundred times before. Sure its a good movie but... where is the innovation?\n- Having to pay for expanded bag space: I feel like you guys decided to throw so much loot at people to just make the upgraded bag slots valid purchase to people because its F-T-P and its their way to show patronage and support while getting something ingame.\n\nRemember this is still ALPHA/Early Access. I am not giving up on this game yet. I really hope the Devs have some shake-N-bake up their robes to bring the current game up to the expectations people have for the game. Maybe my expectations are set too high for DD II, maybe not. Is it worth downloading? Its alright and kills time, the only reason I played as much as I did is because I've had an enjoyable experience so far and do not like losing. Download those 7 gigs and give the game a try, but don't make your final decision on the game till its actually fully released.","November 26, 2015","true","22.0"," 23 of 45 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","23","45","3","1"

I've only played upwards of 25 hours in DD2 and to be honest, I couldn't be more pleased so far. That said, judging this game now would be ridiculous, it's in PRE-ALPHA, which translate to this not finished game, they will add more things and the game will continue to improve. So just wait a bit, taking a pre-alpha game at face value would be silly. So a word of advice from a random gamer, if you're on the fence about this game wait until it's released to give it a chance.\n\nPros of the game:\n-Great graphics\n-More levels\n-New enemy types/ bosses\n-New abilities\n-Specs\n-The Squire found pants.\n\nThe cons:\n-Must be online to play. Who knows though, that may change.\n-Some of the spec options are "Meh" at best.\n-You're unable to out level an area, If I'm 16 in a 10-15 zone, I'm scaled down as to not over power the level.\n-Increasing the range of your defences can be a pain as it is not a stat, you find it on gear.\n\nAll in all this is a wonderful foundation for a game, As they add more into the game, I'm sure it will continue improve and it will be a worthy successor to DD1. As for now, it's one hell of a fun game.","January 5, 2015","true","344.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","4","8","3","0"

But after being release (in early access, which is still the case now) the reviews were pretty mixed, especially from the ones that players DD1. So I waited a few months hoping the game will use the same magic recipe as DD1 and will be an improvement.\n\nAs the game was on sale, I decided to get it and give it a try hoping I will have a tremendous number of hours coming on. Unfortunately after 20 hours on it I was pretty disappointed and don't understand why Trendy made so many bad changes:\n\nPRO:\n- better graphics\n- details on monsters for the incoming wave\n- can see your defenses range by holding the Shift key.\nand to be honest that's pretty much it.\n\nCONS:\n- right after getting the game I wasn't able to join any public game, the servers weren't working properly. Seems to have gone better but it seems like that's a recurring issue. Even joining the public tavern sometimes doesn't work.\n- 4 heroes with 4 towers, compared to 8 x 5. They might add some more later on but right now we are missing a lot on diversity.\n- the stats system has totally changed and is so confusing: gear rating/comparison doesn't seem right, can't boost particular stats anymore (you've to find objects with stats you want), we've lost the range stats (no more high-range harpons).\n- this game will become a free to play (Yeah!) but some upgrades will require real money (Boooo!)\n- most of the shortcuts have changed from DD1\n- DD1 was having a listing of all games and it was easy to join the party you felt will be fun to play (map/mode/difficulty). Now you just join a public tavern and have to select a map+difficulty and you might join a starting game or it will create a new game (and if you quit/cancel right away you are loosing social points, wth!?)\n\nSo far I haven't had any fun playing DD2, I might try to continue leveling up (I've 3 heroes lvl 20) to see if it gets better and unlock some other maps but I'm seriously considering going back to DD1...","August 3, 2015","false","65.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

For those of you who havent played the previous said games, this will be a fun, quirky, 3rd person shooter, tower defence that can entertain you for hours. If you do not know, DD2 is a tower defence based on the fact that you must defend your base by using towers from 1 of 4 classes. Each class can place down a vastly differnt set of towers from each other, and so it is highly suggested that you play with other people of different classes (so sorry all of you fellow defenders who would play as the squire and solo every map). Other than placing towers, you are supposed to use your third person shooter skills, that you obviously aquired from Star Wars Battle Front 2, to shoot the enemies and help defend your base. Overall, the main point i want to portray is that DD2 is BALANCED. The towers of every class are really good and helpful (yes, the huntress's traps are REALLY good!), and each class has different attacks and abillities to make every class able to dish out decent damage without the use of towers.","December 16, 2014","true","163.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

So why even do it ? You probably do it one time then let it go.\n\nLater they added a Nightmare 4 version of the "Spooky maps" but the loot was and is still useless ... good job!\n\nAt the moment trendy focuses on providing more skins (10€ / skin) which seems to be a greater idea than fixing bugs ( like Ogres who are stuck in the spawn ) or providing content which makes the game worth playing.\n\nThe latest patch also nerfed all the gear we were farming for more than 300h but there was at least one good thing, they finally realized that they should remove the legacy gear which gave some people a very big advantage over other people who didn't have a chance to get it.\n\nSadly i can not recommend this game anymore since the major focus is on making money.\n\nOverall opinion:\n\nFeeling punished and betrayed for beeing a long term player. If i could i would refund my collectors edition.\n\n----\nOld Review:\n\nThis is the "true successor" to the original Dungeon Defenders.\nDungeon Defender Eternity made me leave and loose my trust into this company but they changed to the good it seems.\n\nGraphics, controls and gameplay feel really good and smooth.\nThere are still some bugs but tho but nothing game breaking, you won't believe that this game is still in "alpha".\n\nI'll recommend this to all the Tower Defense and RPG Fans out there, you won't regret buying it!","September 24, 2015","false","754.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Now they removed that feature, and replaced it with skill sphere. Oh joy another thing that become completely dependant on item drops.

But after being release (in early access, which is still the case now) the reviews were pretty mixed, especially from the ones that players DD1. So I waited a few months hoping the game will use the same magic recipe as DD1 and will be an improvement.\n\nAs the game was on sale, I decided to get it and give it a try hoping I will have a tremendous number of hours coming on. Unfortunately after 20 hours on it I was pretty disappointed and don't understand why Trendy made so many bad changes:\n\nPRO:\n- better graphics\n- details on monsters for the incoming wave\n- can see your defenses range by holding the Shift key.\nand to be honest that's pretty much it.\n\nCONS:\n- right after getting the game I wasn't able to join any public game, the servers weren't working properly. Seems to have gone better but it seems like that's a recurring issue. Even joining the public tavern sometimes doesn't work.\n- 4 heroes with 4 towers, compared to 8 x 5. They might add some more later on but right now we are missing a lot on diversity.\n- the stats system has totally changed and is so confusing: gear rating/comparison doesn't seem right, can't boost particular stats anymore (you've to find objects with stats you want), we've lost the range stats (no more high-range harpons).\n- this game will become a free to play (Yeah!) but some upgrades will require real money (Boooo!)\n- most of the shortcuts have changed from DD1\n- DD1 was having a listing of all games and it was easy to join the party you felt will be fun to play (map/mode/difficulty). Now you just join a public tavern and have to select a map+difficulty and you might join a starting game or it will create a new game (and if you quit/cancel right away you are loosing social points, wth!?)\n\nSo far I haven't had any fun playing DD2, I might try to continue leveling up (I've 3 heroes lvl 20) to see if it gets better and unlock some other maps but I'm seriously considering going back to DD1...","August 3, 2015","false","65.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

After playing DD2, i really like the game as it has all or not most of my favourite gaming genres, TD, 3rd person shooter/hack and slash. This game is really fun if u have a group of friends that can coordinate well together. But i have played this game most of the time with strangers and i can say that 90% of the time i meet friendly people. So, i can say that the community is good here. The devs have come up with new content for the future and bugfixes here and there.\n\nSo... great game,good community,good devs = GET THE GAME!\n\nAlso, there will obviously be bugs in early access, u can't expect it to be running smoothly without bugs. But so far the bugs i have experienced isn't game breaking.\n\nThanks for reading my review.

As well as the main objective on the harder maps, are side objectives which the player needs to defend otherwise it will allow for more enemies, often flying types to be able to access the map making it harder especially without certain classes.\nLogical thinking is required by the player to complete for ever changes and more difficult maps. As the game calls upon the player to think through the use of their 'Tower Budget' whilst building defences to stop the enemy minions form reaching the main base, the better the tower the higher the cost. Along with the budget, the player has the choice of class types, which impacts the levels massively, as depending on what characters are on the team during the missions effects the difficulty as some cannot attack air units or some are not able to take as many hits as others.\nAlong with the thinking required is the effect of the choices made, as in the game they are able to have a very negative or positive outcome as for example having a Mage try to tank hits from enemies would be a poor choice compared to having a knight tank the hits. But there is a lot more than just deciding what person defends where, each player chooses their class each one having different abilities or attributes that can help the team and as stated above the choice of towers will be one to rule all or end all within an instant.\nConsidering these whilst looking at the game play allows you to see that things are coming together well, the game entices the player into what is called a 'one more round' mood, in which if a player is enjoying the game by winning or by having or rethink the same map several times to pass. As well as being able to invite friends to have a more cooperative team and a more thrilling experience as everyone will be able to have a laugh no matter what the outcome.\nOverall my experience with Dungeon Defenders 2 was a good experience and produced a lot of good points, however with every game there are a few things that can be tweaked. Such as the enchantment system as I never truly understood it whilst using it and the glitch at the main hub (tavern) where players fall through the floor.\n\nOverall i give DD2 a 9/10 rating.","March 19, 2015","true","14.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

Firstly lets go over the game play, dungeon defenders two is a 3D tower defense game basally but more vamped up than you typical td game. You play as one of 4 characters that is available at the moment due to the game being in pre alpha, which is the apprentice, monk, huntress and squire. The apprentice a ranged fighter and is useful for placing down extremely high dps towers that deal aoe dmg but is quite squishy and has low base dmg. The huntress is a high dmg sniper with medium dmg traps they can place down, useful for taking out flying monsters. the squire is a tank with towers that deal a medium to high single target dmg, but makes up for the single target problem by tanking while his towers takes down mobs. Lastly is the monk, who is a melee fighter who deals aoe dmg and also has medium dmg aoe towers but he has extremely hard times dealing with flying enemies.\n\nThe game play that is available at the moment is both challenging and fun at the same time, along with that all maps are beatable with the right strategy which is necessary to have in more higher level maps. The strategy element in the game has been quite nice at the moment,  to be able to win any map you need to use a certain amount of strategy by coordinating with your team mates, for example having the tank take multiple lanes and drawing agro while the towers kill off the enemies. This level of strategy in placed is at a good balance where you can easily pick up how to play properly and the learning curve is quite gentle to newer players to jump right in and not feel way out classed.\n\nThe texture of the game is quite nice with no eye sore images where its to bright or to dark, and doesn't require a high end computer to run the game at a nice medium quality. so far the game has no bugs to be found and from my experience has a smooth game play experience and is really enjoyable to relax with.\n\noverall the only aspect of the game which annoys me is the enchanting system in place, it clunky and slow as well as costing way to much gold to the ratio that you earn per level you win. in my opinion i would make an option to fast enchant the item you're trying to upgrade along with reducing the cost of enchanting slightly or increase the gold income per round or income for selling items\n\nOther than that i would highly recommend the game to all players that are into this type of game.\nRating 9/10\n\n\n\n\n\n","March 19, 2015","true","13.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Minenik/recommended/236110/","Minenik","Russian Cookie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Minenik/","116 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDeep review This is a towerdefense game of a 3rd person view. I would say this game can be comapred to diablo series. Because of the loot system and the grinding involved into it. So lets start of picking your 4 heroes, each hero has its own kit/style.\n\nMage\nThe mage has a  LOT  of aoe spells and places turrets that also deal aoe dmg. Hes ranged and builds turrets pretty well (The mage has a freeze turret that helps pretty well in defense also because his normal turrets deal aoe dmg he can easy deal a lot more dmg). The weapon he uses i a staff.\n\nFighter\nThe fighter is a mele class hero and uses of course a sword. He can build small walls better than others (they deal dmg when someone tries to destroy them).\n\nHunter\nThe hunter places traps that can CC (Crow Control: Stuns, Slows, Silence etc). Also some just deal dmg. She places turrets that can poision the target for a small amout of time. She is ranged and uses a bow.\n\nMonk\nI like to call him lee sin  Because in league of legends lee sin is a blind monk  . Hes weapon is a staff but different from the mages cuz he is mele. He can create totems that will heal you or buff your turrets.\n\nGameplay As i said this is a towerdefense game with where you can roam freely building your towers and walls to not let the enemies get pass you and break the core. You have crystals (green crystals is like your building material and blue is more like your mana to let you use spells). There is a limit on how much building you can build in the field so if a person uses all that liming to build only in one lane and dosent want to destroy it youre screwd.\nThe  loot  system is almost the same as diablo (if not the same). A big amount of grinding is nessecay for leveling up and getting the best loot. Most of the loot you get are usefull at start but at the end game lvl 38 for example, 95% of the loot you get will be useless and is just junk that you sell. Even if you get a legendary it might be useless, someway because of the level cuz youre grinding on low levels and somethimes just of its stats.\nSo lets talk about  XP . At the start its easy to level up as you proceed the campain but after youre done it will get easier. To unlock the insane difficulty and nightmare, nightmare 2 and so on. You have to complete the called quests, but the quest are no more than just lvl up to 50 so when youre lvl for example 38, you have to replay ALOT of the same level to get the most xp out of it and do it agan and again and again till you reach lvl 50 and unlock the insane difficulty to get better loot. Here is where i think is a big gap and alot of people thinking of quiting when they reach this certain point.\nYou can see that the developmers has helped a bit and added daily exp to the first finishing missions. But on the other hand there is still something missing. That gap from lvl (exmpl) 38 to lvl 50 takes a lot of time of replayability so i think that the devolopers can add something into that like for exaple letting them acces the unlimited modes at a lower level than at 40 and still keeping the insane difficulty there. I think that would at least do something (if not fix it).\nCo-Op  is in this game and i highly recommend playing this game with a friend. You can still solo it and do well. But plaing multiplayer is easier because heroes in this game has a great synergy with each others for example lee sin (Monk class) can create totems that gives your turret a lot of power and a significantly increase in dmg.\n\nFree2Pay As the develpers are saying its NOT a pay2win game. Right now you can only use special money on cosmetics and chests that you find as loot. The chest CAN have very good loot but often dosent and just gives you a small boost on your items (Other words: you get better loot but not too far away from what you had). I hope this systems will stay as the realise comes.\n\nDevelopment The game patches is pretty common and i mean it. There was a patch yesterday and a patch today. Those patches arent that big BUT add small features that the community requested. For example the sort panel on bags that wasent before todays patch. You can see (or read) with your own eyes that the developers react to their community and helps.\n\nFinal verdict I dont mind grinding and farming for loot like in diablo with a small gap between the hero lvl. Graphics are ok for a free to play game and port is well optimised. This game is specialy good to play with friends but you can still solo it. The developers are nice and  hear  the community.\n\nI give this game a  8/10","October 24, 2015","true","5.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I just wish the game had mmore boss fight throughout the campaign. Like in the original game there would be a nice big boss every so few levels. Now there is only a final boss at the last level and the campaign simply introduces new enemy types as if they were bosses when they will be regular mobs later on and in the harder difficulty/modes.\n\nIts still got a ways to go.

The event stuff for halloween was fun. We have our four base classes back like the Squire, Huntress, Apprentice, and the Monk. They all play similarly to the original game. I just wish the game had mmore boss fight throughout the campaign. Like in the original game there would be a nice big boss every so few levels. Now there is only a final boss at the last level and the campaign simply introduces new enemy types as if they were bosses when they will be regular mobs later on and in the harder difficulty/modes.\n\nIts still got a ways to go. I also know people are eager to see what classes will be added, as well as more maps for modes like Incursion and Onslaught.\n\nStill pretty nice for an Alpha at the moment.","October 30, 2015","true","148.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I havent beaten the campaign yet but it feels pretty easy so far, though each level I go through gets more complex than the last. So far the monk was mind numbing to play but the mage was an absolute blast. I dont really feel like writing a long drawn out review at the time so I'll just list out some pointers.\n\n+ Items can have cool enchantments like "10% chance to shock your attacker for X damage" or "-1  second manabomb cooldown" which means you're not always just going to be looking for which weapon hits hardest or gives the most of x stat.\n\n+ Co-op with friends is easy to set up and play together. Being 7 levels behind because I wanted to try a different class at the start didnt make us have to go back and level me up. It was still possible to beat the level we left off on.\n\n- This is probably more of a personal point but the monk feels really bland to me. I thought the game was a little bit of a let down when I'd picked him first. But I didnt like him in the other games either.\n\n+ From what I can tell there's alot of customization to be done through Skill orbs such as bonus crit chance, specific bonuses to towers (such as the ice tower slowing more, I think), bonus attack damage, bonus specific tower range, global tower range. I hope they add more skills to switch out with some of the current ones to just add onto that level of customization.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to drop a positive review on this because I had a ton of fun playing it. I cant wait to see what all happens between now and full release. I'll add onto my review if I come over anything else I like or dislike.","October 12, 2015","true","22.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Very enjoyable. For a while.\n\nIt lacks all the little things, the depth, that makes you want to keep playing the game beyond the first 10-15 hours.\n\nIn DD1, you could really delve into stats, builds, and have fun with varied maps and challenges. Plus, there was an actual feel of progression. Here, you grind through a lvl 30 map until you get to the level cap (50), simply because it's better than any other gamemode or map when it comes to XP per hour per effort.\n\nIn truth, if DD2 didn't kill all activity on DD1, I'd still be playing DD1.\n\nThis game is not an improvement. It's a dumbed down game with better graphics.\nBut the potentional is there.","February 8","false","43.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Even as a pre alpha game the gameplay is pretty darn good especially if you include the fact that the UI is more user friendly and also the POV is much much better than DD1. Not only that but the graphics aree really good compared to DD1 whose models and textures were pretty dark and didn't seem that much satisfying to play with. Overall the game is somewhat buggy as sometimes you might experience some usual pre alpha stuff you find in most games. The multiplayer is ok but laggy at some times. I also look forward to having more skills and towers/traps per class and also an offline mode which TBH i only want when i'm bored because soloing the maps are soo much harder than DD1.\n\nOkay. I've been playing alot more of DD2 now, and I have to say that the negative reviews this game is getting, it dosen't deserve it. People are complaining how "grindy" this game is, but that's the actual nature of the game. You compare this to DD1 wherein basically people have found ways to hack both the casual and "ranked" mode to get items that give imense amounts of stats, so that's why trendy pushed how DD2 is now. Honestly i'm a fan of grinding in games, and maybe that's a personal preference, but if you're one of those people who complain, and on the side plays monster hunter or some other MMORPG, then if you can do that there, then why not here. Please do not give me the Bullsh** that "Because it's not thesame game" well give it a Fu***ng chance. It may be repetetive, but so is alot of current F2P models out there, like league. If you can stand playing on thesame map, thesame 3 lanes, and somewhat basically the heroes/champs in dota and lol, then why can't you stand playing different maps, using different strategies, using different stat build, etc. I'm just sad that people would give up on the game just because of small resons.

Game feels to linear and only provides a few days of fun after each patch, a TD game usually tends to not be as fun after each map playthrough. Going Open Alpha shortly id recomend you wait for that, as good graphically as the game and costumes are, the game experience is lacking.\n\nwith a few more modes for longevity, some competitive modes and more maybe (they could look into other custom maps on wc3 for idea's.)\n\nThe game can become great, it has potential. But its all round the place and patches are very sporadic and feel un-tested.\n\nEdit.\n\nCame back for a bit games still bad if not worse (aside from weapons) with a even more horrible patch called "Carnival" and patches that came with mroe bugs than fix's. Im looking forward to New heroes, but even more core rebalance and the hero deck change. I'll probably be back again after core rebalance hopefully its good enough for me to change my review then.","September 4, 2015","false","587.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've reached level 50 on all 4 characters, sure I've grinded a little bit, but with the monthly mission, and daily missions, all different characters, lots of different maps, I'd say I haven't grown bored yet from always having variety of a certain kind. Sure, the characters are each amazing for one specific build and suck at the rest, but does it matter? It does come into play with tactics when you reach the end, because the dropped gear is most likely useless if you want defense gear for a tower builder, and you're playing on your hero character, since the "passives" will be made for that particular character you play as. That adds challenge, in my opinion, to using your characters and towers correctly.\n\nAlso, fun to play with friends, I haven't put money into it, and probably won't put any money into costumes since they, easily unlocked by real money, can still be unlocked with the in-game special currency, that (as far as I know) only comes from Dailies and Monthly missions. I really think people should consider playing the game a little, before complaining about it being all "Microtransactions? This will be a pay-to-win game for sure!"\n\nSo, all in all, I recommend this game, whether you're a solo player or have friends to play with, though it's always better when you have friends to play with :).\n\n\nP.S. If any developer see's this, I'm curious, when we step out of Alpha, will people keep their characters and items, or will it be reset and we receive stuff based on our playing? Something else maybe?\n\n\nP.S.S. I noticed only 2 bugs in the game so far.\n\n1: Sometimes (SPOILER) Harbinger may stay around even after you finish a "phase" with him, where you can't touch him, he can touch you easily aswell as the ship.\n\n2: Sometimes gold & tower mana (greens) can disappear from the ground when I, or a teammate, opens the tower mana chest after a round, and I do not get it picked up, neither gold nor mana, but perhaps there's another explanation to this?","January 8","true","125.7"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","14","28","3","0"

What can I say? I bought the first Dungeon Defenders on my Playstation 3, loved it, so I purchased it on my pc with all of the DLC. One of my all time favorite games, this one had a lot to live up to. So does it? Heck yeah it does! I purchased the game on Early Access, and let me just say that this is Early Access done right! With so many dev teams abusing the Early Access platform on steam, this definetly gives me hope for Early Access in general. The developers respond to feedback and even allow players to vote for changes to the game on the launcher. Early Adopters were rewarded with $30 of in-game currency as well as a unique cosmetic for each of the 4 heroes currently available in the game (although I do wish the items were a little flashier for bragging purposes :D) I would say the campaign is a bit shorter than the original, and develops the story very little. I would assume that expansions are on their way, as I cannot stress enough how little the plot progresses, so if you're looking for a full story, you won't find it yet.\n\nBut how's the gameplay? The tower defense is amazing, although there are many tower's that haven't returned or have been altered significantly. But to make up for this, there are a few new towers. Hero spells have also been changed, and a whole new type of energy is used for them, which frees you up. You don't have to choose between using hero abilities, or getting that tower upgrade you desperately need. The action element of the game definetly feels nice, but you won't find yourself being able to completely ditch towers like you could with a maxed barb or huntress in the first Dungeon Defenders. You could argue that this is actually a plus though.\n\nShould you buy it? F2P? YES! What are you waiting for!? P2P? YES! The Devs deserve the support! But I recommend trying it F2P first, just to make sure it's your thing.","October 13, 2015","true","64.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Level up and fully custimize your hero with stat points, spehres, pets and gear to deal with the baddies in the way you see fit. Work on your hero themselves or your defences. Each hero has there own set of defences such as walls and towers and traps to ''defend'' the chosen objective. Each mission is very colorful and completed with difficulties for your team to overcome. A great co -op and friends game , becuase you all need to work together, hero and defence wise to protect the objective and well, from experiece if you don't....you fail. You spend equal time defending, as setting up defences to gearing up and looking through loot.

So why even do it ? You probably do it one time then let it go.\n\nLater they added a Nightmare 4 version of the "Spooky maps" but the loot was and is still useless ... good job!\n\nAt the moment trendy focuses on providing more skins (10€ / skin) which seems to be a greater idea than fixing bugs ( like Ogres who are stuck in the spawn ) or providing content which makes the game worth playing.\n\nThe latest patch also nerfed all the gear we were farming for more than 300h but there was at least one good thing, they finally realized that they should remove the legacy gear which gave some people a very big advantage over other people who didn't have a chance to get it.\n\nSadly i can not recommend this game anymore since the major focus is on making money.\n\nOverall opinion:\n\nFeeling punished and betrayed for beeing a long term player. If i could i would refund my collectors edition.\n\n----\nOld Review:\n\nThis is the "true successor" to the original Dungeon Defenders.\nDungeon Defender Eternity made me leave and loose my trust into this company but they changed to the good it seems.\n\nGraphics, controls and gameplay feel really good and smooth.\nThere are still some bugs but tho but nothing game breaking, you won't believe that this game is still in "alpha".\n\nI'll recommend this to all the Tower Defense and RPG Fans out there, you won't regret buying it!","September 24, 2015","false","754.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've only played upwards of 25 hours in DD2 and to be honest, I couldn't be more pleased so far. That said, judging this game now would be ridiculous, it's in PRE-ALPHA, which translate to this not finished game, they will add more things and the game will continue to improve. So just wait a bit, taking a pre-alpha game at face value would be silly. So a word of advice from a random gamer, if you're on the fence about this game wait until it's released to give it a chance.\n\nPros of the game:\n-Great graphics\n-More levels\n-New enemy types/ bosses\n-New abilities\n-Specs\n-The Squire found pants.\n\nThe cons:\n-Must be online to play. Who knows though, that may change.\n-Some of the spec options are "Meh" at best.\n-You're unable to out level an area, If I'm 16 in a 10-15 zone, I'm scaled down as to not over power the level.\n-Increasing the range of your defences can be a pain as it is not a stat, you find it on gear.\n\nAll in all this is a wonderful foundation for a game, As they add more into the game, I'm sure it will continue improve and it will be a worthy successor to DD1. As for now, it's one hell of a fun game.","January 5, 2015","true","344.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","4","8","3","0"

But after being release (in early access, which is still the case now) the reviews were pretty mixed, especially from the ones that players DD1. So I waited a few months hoping the game will use the same magic recipe as DD1 and will be an improvement.\n\nAs the game was on sale, I decided to get it and give it a try hoping I will have a tremendous number of hours coming on. Unfortunately after 20 hours on it I was pretty disappointed and don't understand why Trendy made so many bad changes:\n\nPRO:\n- better graphics\n- details on monsters for the incoming wave\n- can see your defenses range by holding the Shift key.\nand to be honest that's pretty much it.\n\nCONS:\n- right after getting the game I wasn't able to join any public game, the servers weren't working properly. Seems to have gone better but it seems like that's a recurring issue. Even joining the public tavern sometimes doesn't work.\n- 4 heroes with 4 towers, compared to 8 x 5. They might add some more later on but right now we are missing a lot on diversity.\n- the stats system has totally changed and is so confusing: gear rating/comparison doesn't seem right, can't boost particular stats anymore (you've to find objects with stats you want), we've lost the range stats (no more high-range harpons).\n- this game will become a free to play (Yeah!) but some upgrades will require real money (Boooo!)\n- most of the shortcuts have changed from DD1\n- DD1 was having a listing of all games and it was easy to join the party you felt will be fun to play (map/mode/difficulty). Now you just join a public tavern and have to select a map+difficulty and you might join a starting game or it will create a new game (and if you quit/cancel right away you are loosing social points, wth!?)\n\nSo far I haven't had any fun playing DD2, I might try to continue leveling up (I've 3 heroes lvl 20) to see if it gets better and unlock some other maps but I'm seriously considering going back to DD1...","August 3, 2015","false","65.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

The main issue I had was performance issues, not the usual kind of fps issues that people are complaining about on the forums, but there was few troubles just trying to get the game launched.\n\nOn my first try, I clicked the Play button in the launcher, then nothing happened. When I sorted programs by RAM usage in the Task Manager, I found out that the .exe was the the bottom of the list, so I had to force close it.\nMy second try got a step further, which got me relieved. However, the DD2 logo appeared, then the whole thing froze. Appeared as "Not Responding" RAM usage doesn't cost as much as running Steam.\nI decided to give myself a final try. Sadly the result I got was the same.You might say:\nThe game's in closed alpha - give the developers some time. Um, how about no. Since its launch date, the developers had 9 months to work on the game, but nothing was done in terms of performance optimisation/bug extermination?\nMy PC is not up to its performance requirements. You may be right.  Either that or the requirements listed on the store page is giving out false information.","September 13, 2015","false","8.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","5"

You want to try and tell me that this game costs $25, slap on an early access or pre-alpha tag and think you can get away with a fully functioning micro-transaction system? $50 micro transactions?! THATS NOT MICRO! YOUR FULL GAME DOES NOT COST THAT MUCH. Almost $10 for a single costume, and then more on top of that to unlock the alternate accessories? How about you guys actually focus on making and FINISHING the game instead of some cash shop items. Hell the $50 extra for the collectors edition upgrade is even more crap. 4 character skins, 4 tower skins (which aren't in the game yet) 10,000 in-game cash shop currency, and a title. You could spend that $50 and get DD1 with all of the DLC, or a 4 pack of DD1 and have even more fun with your friends.\n\nAnd for those of you saying "Well this is just there way of gaining support to make the game better." No, it's not. The collector's edition, maybe. Not this BS micro transaction crap. I already know where this is heading, there going to make the level cap high, and slow the leveling process to a halt halfway through. Then they start selling speed-ups, EXP, money, item droprate boosters. At the prices I'm already seeing I imangine they'll be $5 each, or a bundle pack for $10. Other games and other companies have pulled this same crap, and a lot of those were crucified by gamers. Just because they made a decent game once doesn't mean they should be immune to this.\n\nWhat happened to my character customization? Why can't I change my characters colors, put skill points into the towers and skills that I like the most? Because they monitized how your charcter looks and streamlined all forms of character building. Now you pick a character, name it, and that's all you get to do. Oh, but you get skill spheres. That's scool right? You get a total of 7 skill spheres: 3 small (stat boosters) 2 medium (tower/skill boosters), 1 large (tower/skill modifier), and 1 uber (huge boost to tower ability I guess). And that's it. That's all you get to do. There is no other form of customization, you don't get to level up skills or towers, you don't get to modify any of that crap. This is basic stuff that was in the first game. Why whould you take it away?\n\nYeah, I get it, the game is pre-alpha (which is a BS excuse to ignore any problems people like me have considering how this game looks and plays) and a part of me really wants to like and enjoy it for what it is, but these terrible business practices will need to either change. I will not play this game ever again, and I will go back to playing DD1 as it is a more fun, enjoyable, and fulfilling experience, with or without friends. Do yourself a favor and go buy that. If you'll excuse I'm going to go put in for a refund now.","August 7, 2015","false","2.3"," 23 of 46 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","23","46","5","4"

You make a 'sequel' with less depth to draw in the F2P crowd.\n\nThere isn't much to say about Dungeon Defenders 2.  It's practically the same game with less towers, smaller maps, fewer bosses, fewer heroes, and an even more tedious grind-to-progress system.  And while the first game could have stood to benefit from more focus this shifts the focus more towards hero action than a tower defense game.  Dropping in a multiplayer game you will rarely be able to build your own fortifications as you start with little mana and the players already there will have taken up the defense limit.  It forces you to recruit friends to play so you can manage some strategy or treat the game as if it were a shallow Diablo-clone focusing on your hero stats.\n\nTechnically the game is in rough shape.  After nearly a year of Early Access on Steam (and a longer period where it wasn't available for sale) optimization is extremely poor.  Stutters and slowdowns are constant on my 770 with an i5 processor and in two days I've lost count of the number of times I've had to Alt F4 out of a loading screen that hangs forever.\n\nUpdated: The loading screen issues have been fixed although there is still a degree of stuttering after transitions.\n\nTo their credit there's no P2W going on.  The stuff you buy with cash is mostly cosmetic and/or speeding up the time you can acquire pets and such.  And, of course, there's daily quests, gold farming, all that 'fun' stuff.  All Trendy has done  here is repackage DD1 and wrapped it up into a nuBlizzard F2P shell.","September 14, 2015","false","54.5"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","20","40","0","6"

Where to begin? Well...let's start off with what I don't like.\n\nThe game is quite a bit easier. The maps are visually more interesting to look at and have more full 3D depth to them, which makes them interesting to run around in at times. But each lane is identified for you immediately, and the maps are designed in such a way that you can't have an "aha!" moment as you discover a way to place a single tower to cover multiple choke-points. Either the developer placed the chokepoint for you and pointed you right to it, or the chokepoint doesn't exist. This can help to eliminate the feeling of "trial and error" gameplay that existed in the first game, but it also means you can never feel like you're outsmarting the developer when you find a good way to place your towers.\n\nIn some ways, this doesn't necessarily change the final feeling of the game, as in the first one, once you figured it out, you always placed towers in the best spots. I suppose this makes it easier to play the game in public groups or with friends that don't really play video games the same way you do, but it makes all of the maps feel a little samey after awhile, because you never get to experience that first moment of wonder as you treat the map like a puzzle to be solved.\n\nThe pricing of the cosmetic items is...quite high. I find myself learning to enjoy the default skins, since purchasing the outfits i'd like would quickly put this game at a higher price than an off the shelf, AAA title. I don't have a problem with the microtransactions themselves, I think it'd just be nicer if they were a little more "micro" so I could get a few skins and not feel like i'm getting robbed.\n\nNow on to what's been improved!\n\nThe new hero-deck system will (eventually) prevent a single player from effectively filling every role. Playing with friends in the first game could be quite difficult at times, because you were capable of leveling up and gearing out the entire cast, and placing every tower type. Your friends could quickly outgrow you, and if you didn't play a ranger or barbarian, there was little reason for you to be in the game with such a person, since their towers would be better than what you could make. Being limited to a certain number of heroes encourages you to work together - once there are more hero types than there are deck slots, you'll need at least two players to do everything. It's forced co-op sure, but at least you can always be useful to your friends, since you can bring something that they cannot.\n\nThe way they introduce new unit types as mini-bosses feels good. Later maps and harder difficulties can repeatedly spawn mini-boss versions of these enemies too. Since there are a lot of things that can define an enemy (such as movement speed, walking or flying, special attacks, resistances), they keep your defenses in check and ensure that everyone has something to contribute. Defenses and your attentiveness get tested as each lane fights to divert your attention across the map. The new, proper bosses feel a lot more interesting than all of the bosses from the first game, too. They have mechanics that make them more than a "bullet sponge", and it was an excellent move making them a bit of an outside force that interacts with the map and the waves in interesting ways, instead of just being placed awkwardly and requiring that you blindly hit it with regular attacks and awkwardly placed towers.\n\nThe aesthetics of the game are sweet. Everything is much nicer to look at.\n\nI think my biggest complaint is that I just wish the game was harder. Not in a "just make the numbers bigger" way, but that the maps were actually more interesting to play. It feels like the entire campaign is a tutorial to get you acclimated to the games mechanics. The maps never seem to get nearly as complex or interesting as they were in the first game....The revisited maps in 'the harbinger awakens' content update come closer and are definitely more fun than the maps that came before it, which gives me hope for the future. You really can't go wrong with "free" though, and I can see myself losing a few more evenings as I continue to play this with my fiancée. But ultimately, I don't think either of us will be sinking dozens or even hundreds of hours into it like we did the first time around.","December 29, 2015","true","25.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Game feels to linear and only provides a few days of fun after each patch, a TD game usually tends to not be as fun after each map playthrough. Going Open Alpha shortly id recomend you wait for that, as good graphically as the game and costumes are, the game experience is lacking.\n\nwith a few more modes for longevity, some competitive modes and more maybe (they could look into other custom maps on wc3 for idea's.)\n\nThe game can become great, it has potential. But its all round the place and patches are very sporadic and feel un-tested.\n\nEdit.\n\nCame back for a bit games still bad if not worse (aside from weapons) with a even more horrible patch called "Carnival" and patches that came with mroe bugs than fix's. Im looking forward to New heroes, but even more core rebalance and the hero deck change. I'll probably be back again after core rebalance hopefully its good enough for me to change my review then.","September 4, 2015","false","587.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Even as a pre alpha game the gameplay is pretty darn good especially if you include the fact that the UI is more user friendly and also the POV is much much better than DD1. Not only that but the graphics aree really good compared to DD1 whose models and textures were pretty dark and didn't seem that much satisfying to play with. Overall the game is somewhat buggy as sometimes you might experience some usual pre alpha stuff you find in most games. The multiplayer is ok but laggy at some times. I also look forward to having more skills and towers/traps per class and also an offline mode which TBH i only want when i'm bored because soloing the maps are soo much harder than DD1.\n\nOkay. I've been playing alot more of DD2 now, and I have to say that the negative reviews this game is getting, it dosen't deserve it. People are complaining how "grindy" this game is, but that's the actual nature of the game. You compare this to DD1 wherein basically people have found ways to hack both the casual and "ranked" mode to get items that give imense amounts of stats, so that's why trendy pushed how DD2 is now. Honestly i'm a fan of grinding in games, and maybe that's a personal preference, but if you're one of those people who complain, and on the side plays monster hunter or some other MMORPG, then if you can do that there, then why not here. Please do not give me the Bullsh** that "Because it's not thesame game" well give it a Fu***ng chance. It may be repetetive, but so is alot of current F2P models out there, like league. If you can stand playing on thesame map, thesame 3 lanes, and somewhat basically the heroes/champs in dota and lol, then why can't you stand playing different maps, using different strategies, using different stat build, etc. I'm just sad that people would give up on the game just because of small resons.

Combinations of traps and defenses is the hidden gems of this game ( like Water trap goes really well with Electric aura, Frost turrets and heroes's skills, .. etc)\n-The possibility of defense layout is endless, but due to some unbalanced perks of a certain traps, the current layout is pretty much plain and similar. However, there's a undescribable joy when you and your friends discovered a new layout that actually work.\n-The diversity in each heroes is wonderfully rich. Each and every characters have their own fun and perks so think twice before you choose your heroes.\n-The only one thing that can really bore you is the grind. Much like every games, you must farm to be stronger, to be able to climb higher; but this game is weighted heavily on the farm and the endless grind, which is fun at first but will quickly turn into a chore rather than a game. So my advice is to not focusing too much on your stats. Looking for a piece of gear that has 1% higher in passives won't bring you any good, only frustuating and miserable; just enjoy the victory with your comrades after an epic match.\n\n> To DD1 players, this game is designed with the co-op in mind, so it's probably a lot harder to solo; try to find some friends to play with.\n\n**tl;dr: A good co-op strategy tower defense with a mix of RPG, game requires you to be quick on your feet, not just afk and let the defenses do all the jobs. Despite the name it's completely different from DD1 so don't compare it too much with its former self.\n\nedit: grammur","February 25","true","596.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

It is extremely addicting and easy to get into. Most tower defense games you just place stuff and go afk for a few min but DD2 makes it incredibly interactive and almost like a tower defense mmorpg. Characters have attacks that feel pretty satisfying. It can work with any playstyle. If you just want to take it easy or cause yourself many hours of frustration, this game will suit your needs. I do recommend playing on easy or normal until you get a good feel for where to place towers. The classes are all very fun and new classes will probably continue to be added.

Well, people still can hack on a server sided game, It's not that hard when you know what you're doing plus It's just stupid, stop being lazy and make a good anti-cheats system or use VAC with some kind of overwatch, It is not perfect, far away to be, If it detects any kind of modifications or applications that modify stuff, It will gets you a VAC ban so of course It is not perfect but It gets the job done, making the game server sided won't do anything good, people won't want to buy it and you know what they'll do then, I don't need to explain do I?\n\nIt's funny but at the same time It is not, developers think that something is worth that much but for real It is not even worth 9.99$ For example "$100 of in-game currency ($130 of total in-game currency)"\nNo, just stop it, all of that is not even worth 5$ It's just skins and a few gems that you can use to buy skins with, It is NOT worth 100$ neither 50$, stop it with that crap, It's getting real annoying.\nThey said the same with Evolve, that the game is worth 150$ The game is barely worth 29$ Stop it with that damn crap, it's breaking my balls, all that crap is seriously breaking my balls.\nCome on, a few worthless skins and in game currency is not worth ♥♥♥♥, stop acting like you guys know everything, you don't know anything about video games neither marketing.\nDamn developers these days, they're such a nuisance to the video game industry.\nIt takes 7 hours or more to hatch a pet, this is not a simulation or a facebook game, we PC gamers want the best, no phone or console crap.\n\nNow, yes you can get some of the outfits in game (not all of them though) without having to spend real money but It's still a bad thing.\n\nThat is the reason why I'm giving this game 4/10.\n\nI do hope you'll do something about it, If you do then I'll change my review.\n\nIf you do own the first Dungeon Defenders then you should stick with it, if you do not own it then you should get it.\n\n\nEdit: I've lost my characters for no reasons plus I've just noticed that you have to pay new slots with in game currency (the one that you pay with real money), how far are you going to do? Stop it with your BS and be a real developer, not a pathetic money grabber one.\nThe difficulty is too easy In my opinion (except the last level that can be harsh on hard if but that's all) and I should say that It is easiest when alone (except if you play with people that know how to play unlike some).\nThe hitboxes with the square are horrible but since It is Alpha, I'm fine with it as long as it gets fixed.\n\nIn the end, the game is good, I'm not hating on it, I just hate the fact that the developer decided to use the bad method of marketing, the one that should not exist that is microtransactions and online required to play.\nI seriously hope that they will fix it, if they do then It will be a really great game, perhaps not better than the first one but a great game.\nFor now I can't really recommend it except if it is on sale for at least 60% or in the franchise pack for   75% or more.","August 6, 2015","false","15.7"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","21","43","0","28"

It's pretty good to me but what renders it a little unplayable is how you actually play it.  To play a level, you much join a server, even if you want to do a singleplayer run.  The servers are very laggy at the moment, with 3+ second delays between when I press a key and actually seeing it in game.  I'm constantly "teleporting" due to this server lag and sometimes falling to my death; and the horrible sound I hear when jumping sometimes, just hurts.  I don't like hearing the same sound played multiple times when it should only be played once, but that again is due to server lag.\n\nI would recommend the game if there was an option for local games or a singleplayer mode, just something so that people don't have to deal with BS server lag and bad connections to the current servers.\n\nOther than that, I like the game so far, but it's a little difficult for me to make much  progress at the moment.","July 31, 2015","false","4.0"," 19 of 39 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","19","39","3","2"

Go on the DD2 forums and read the "Game Feedback" subforum for a good idea of all the things that are wrong with this game. I used to LOVE DD1 and I'm still playing DD2 because it genuinely is fun but I hate myself for it because Trendy truly just don't deserve anyone's support at this point.\n\nThere are countless easily fixable bugs which have existed for who knows how long and keep getting ignored because the devs are too busy creating the next moneygrab event or whatever. Bugs you come across every single time you play. They're not critical but they can be extremely annoying, especially considering the fact that they could all probably be fixed in a single day by a competent programmer. The heroes are grossly unbalanced and a lot of towers are completely useless.\n\nInventory space is extremely limited, events and game mechanics(eggs, lockboxes etc) add a LOT of useless clutter items while extra inventory space costs money. The endgame content requires several builder heroes, so many in fact that you have to buy extra character slots just to have everything you need. Many aspects of the game such as item upgrading or spinning this ridiculous event wheel have unnecessary animations you have to sit through and although the upgrade wheel does have a skip function it's really buggy and only seems to work about half the time.\n\nItem stats are horrible, there is no leeway or room for customization. There is a certain type of item you want for a certain type of hero and there is no alternative. You get that perfect roll or it's trash.\n\nThis game has potential to be amazing, the concept is a lot of fun and the artwork in this game is just awe inspiring. Really one of the best looking games I've ever seen. However it's being ruined by the devs seemingly focusing purely on things that can make them money and turning a blind eye to things that will make the gaming experience better for the players. I personally will not spend a cent on this game until Trendy makes a LOT of changes and I will tell anyone who asks to stay away from the game because even if it is a lot of fun right now it's not worth all the frustration caused by bugs and dumb gameplay design decisions.\n\nIn case anyone's still on the edge about this game, let me illustrate the kind of crap you can expect: There is a gamemode named Onslaught. It is quite hard, possibly the hardest game mode. In Onslaught you can decide what kind of loot you want - weapons, armor, trinkets, pets or gold. Now any reasonable person would expect the gold farming mode to be the most efficient gold farm in the game right? When there is a dedicated gold farming mode you expect that to be a good way to go about farming gold.\n\nWell, you'd be disappointed because it's completely useless. You could faceroll a regular campaign map on Easy difficulty and earn more gold than doing the Onslaught gold farm on Nightmare.\n\nThis is the kind of crap Trendy's playerbase has to put up with. It's not a huge problem in itself, it just illustrates very clearly how misguided the developers are. They add things which make no sense, ignore things that should have been fixed months ago and generally just mess up everything.","March 26","false","163.0"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","16","33","0","0"

Secondly most of the ranged enemies int he game out range most of the tower making it near impossible to focus your attention elese where. The constant baby sitting of your towers is kind of counter-tower defense in my opinion.\n\nMobs - Spear chuckers toss spears for 3 miles away out ranging everything and thier spears appear to be armor penetrating as well. Orge's one shot pretty much everything from towers to heroes.\n\nHero's - Armed with weaksauce weapons, and slightly less damp toliet paper armor, they feel weak and borderline uselss against the bigger mobs you have to take on. No hero stats anymore like in DD1 where you could tune your gear to be DPS or Tower spec.\n\nMaps - Made by someone who odviously likes playing hack and slash, and has no knowledge of tower defense games and choke points. Almost all the maps have no good defenseable choke points that some spear chucker or dragon cant just range down from afar.\n\nMisc - This might just be me, or the game but it is extremely annoying that in order to choose a differnt difficulty range while playing with other people who are lvling up with you, that you have to leave and enter the starter tavern again, just to set the difficulty again.\n\n\n4/10  - wait for free to play and pray they dont make it Pay to win.\n\nBottom line is, if you loved DD1, dont bother with DD2 unless you like feeling like your at a contant disadvantage.","December 11, 2014","false","90.7"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","14","29","0","0"

Was well worth the price if you enjoy this genre of games. And for a "pre alpha" this is one polished game. glad to have picked it up during early access.\n\nUpdate: 2015-04-26\n\nDevelopers are constantly keeping up to date with new patches and content, as well as interacting via twitch on upcoming goodies :P This game really is alot of fun with a group of friends or even randoms. It offers that itch i've been looking for.\n\nLike i said before it is well worth the money. I realize that the goal of the developers is to make it a free to play which will allow them more options in the future, but currently its in "pre-alpha" and im not sure when it'll change to alpha or even beta. so if you think it looks like something you'd like. i'd say go for it. this was my first free to play purchase that i've made. And at first i was like great its going to be free to play, and yet i bought it. But i'd have to wait for this extremely fun defense game to come out.\n\nPros:\n-Developer Interaction via Twitch\n-Increasing amount of content\n-Great art style\n-Fluid Gameplay\n-Fun Co-op Experience\n-Teamwork is essential :P\n-Current community is great\n\nCons:\n-Minor bugs (but hey, its pre alpha :D)\n-Not as much fun solo\n-Some difficulties/maps almost impossible solo\n-Currently a small community\n\nUpdate: 2015-07-28\n\nIll be 100% honest. If you played DD1 this game may not be for you. i never played DD1. It seems as though everyone who has, has become disappointed with the turn out of this game so far. i haven't play much as of recently, but being new to the Dungeon Defenders franchise, i really like this game so far. Which probably means i'd love DD1.\n\nIts still a great game. Has bugs. Starting to see microtransaction creeping in which no ones a fan of. But so far it has a great community and i like how its turning out. Maybe wait till it goes Free To Play before you give it a shot? but i felt it was worth what i paid.","April 26, 2015","true","107.1"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","14","29","0","1"

Now I just hope that some of my friends will join me...\n\nOverall, the game has changed it's every aspect. It has become different, though remained the same. The atmosphere is magical and charming. And gameplay is quite smooth, actually, both in terms of fps rate and the game process itself. And, what really is importmant to me, the interface is quite intuitive, though still leaves much to be desired. For example - I've set a mouse button for some ability, and on the icon of this ability it says: MouseThumbButton1.

I do not recomend it because the vast amount of my time playing was spent dealing with matchmaking issues - even in private games. The latest patch said they fixed matchmaking errors, and I gave it a go. I couldn't even get into one private match.\n\nThis game is still in alpha so they can downplay all the bugs - bugs that should've been fixed before they started adding very expensive content (for real money).  One costume in particular costs $50 USD.\n\nI don't recomend this game because there seems to be far more of an emphasis on selling in-game items for real money, than fixing gameplay issues - you know, the thing the Alpha stage is meant to be about.\n","April 16","false","10.1"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","14","29","0","4"

Few issues I hope are fixed:\n\n1. half of the games you join the host is afk, when you go to join a new one you'll re-join the same one half the time. gets annoying.\n\n2. after you win a match and everyone hit G, it goes to an overview screen that has an additional countdown that you can't skip - makes each game take longer for no reason.\n\n3. no votekick\n\n4. green mana seems a little too scarce each round - you're spending it all on repairs and not really able to expand on your towers much.\n\n5. gear seems uninteresting.  I'm still wearing lvl 5 gear on my lvl 16 mage due to not finding anything better.\n\nThis is pre-alpha so i'm not complaining - so far i'm having a blast.

It's more of a tower defense-lite. You can not select priority on your units, so your towers will likely focus on goblin fodder on the ground while a flying bomb passes overhead and goes straight for your objective.\n\nThe AI is a joke, many of your losses will be due to just straight up horrible AI.\n\nThis game is in one word; broken. I crash at least a dozen times a day, and that is not exclusive to my experience, this happens to everybody. Trendy refuses to acknowledge it. Instead they sweep it under the rug while they continue to release more content.\n\nTrendy Entertainment as a studio is a total failure. This game is being begrudgingly birthed out of the UDK engine while Trendy Entertainment sits on live stream and straight up admits they have no idea what they're doing.\n\nRecently Trendy Entertainment sued Ark development team for a whopping 40 million dollars, while I believe they were 100% justified legally, I fail to see how this money is being used to improve their game. Nothing has changed, this game is still cobbled together by misshapen, broken lego bricks. You'd think when a company makes more money in a suit then they have ever made in their entire existence that you'd see some sort of change.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game, and I don't know why. I have 500+ hours and I will continue to play it. I really wish I could explain why I enjoy it, seeing as I spend most of the time playing being frustrated by how broken everything is, but I can't.","May 14","true","602.5"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","1"

This is the game for you! It is casual (but rewards those who put their time into playing it), it has excellent equipment system with amazing variety, decent hero progression and a lot of tactical planning. You can play it solo (it allows you to create your own "party" of heroes), with friends or with some random people.\n\nDespite it being an alpha version, the game is perfectly playable and offers hours and hours (and hours) of content. Constant updates keep the game balanced and add lots of content. It's very intuitive (apart from map selection but well, it's an alpha after all), the engine is solid and the game as-such is quite nicely balanced. It's definitely worth supporting.

Hopefully soon weekly quests or tiered monthly quests as discussed on a recent blog.\n\nCons\n- Slow development time for new features and small bug fixes.\n- Gear resets have happen instead of limiting gear and then releasing better gear that make the OP gear obsolete.\n- Leveling for new players is about 5x slower than it should be (my opinion).\n- Pets are cool and fun but dont really do much to make them unique besides another piece of gear.\n- Many of the in game purchases are a waste. For exapmple, some pets you can only get from spending $$$ and then you often get a common quality one. No one keeps those and they should be legendary if you are going to spend the money on it. See the comment above where pets dont really give you a big bonus from pet to pet anyway. Just make it Legendary for the 5% extra stats or whatever it is imo.\n\nThis game is worth giving it 20 minutes and making your own decision from there.

Thou i could not personally say much as i basically only have a level 4, i will say what i do know.\n\nThis game is awesome in many aspects, it rebuilds the foundations for which original Hero's were made. This is certainly something i almost did not expect with the Abyss Lord, also refered to as "The Summoner *Dungeon Defenders*.\n\nHowever, the only thing that i do feel about this game that is diffrent and may make this feel lacking is the scale of where and what you can build, and defense area. I could be just saying that, because i'v only seen the small maps. But when i really think and feel about it, i can't defend as natrually as i'd like to.\n\nFor anyone just starting out, this game and many others will basically feel like a game not worth your time, but i strongly suggest you rethink what you have said, if you put in as many hours as i did on the Original game, you might find that the higher your level, the more fun you start having, and the more balanced things start to feel.\n\nIn the Original game, i had the Jester, Hunter, Summoner, Barbarian, Countess, Squire, Huntress, Ev Series 1, Monk and most of them i got to either level 100 or close. This is when you start setting a goal for the ULTIMATE gear which takes waves and WAVES of time to loot. The fun part is, that while your farming for this loot, you acctually get a chance to think about defense Stratagys, and maybe even what you should primarily upgrade your gear to. Personally, i started throwing all my points into Countess and Hunter for Defenses, The Monk was Area of effect and tanky ammounts of life or defenses collapsed. Also Ev for her buff beam... Yeah, the good times.\n\nI never offically started having the fun of my Life till i hit the level 80 mark, but when i did, i started thinking about playing the game all over again, maybe even with my friends :)\n\nI'd Recommend this game, and can't wait till i get ALOT of spare time to play it, also can't wait to play it with my friends.\n\nPS: I felt i had to say something, because thou i am not enjoying the game at this current point in time, i do enjoy building a character and enjoy playing more with friends.

As someone who played and enjoyed a lot of ARK, I can say if someone breaks the law then someone breaks the law. Its the developers fault for not checking contracts.\n\nThat being said, the game is fine. If you liked DD1 you will like DD2, plain and simple. Its a third person tower defense with farming and character deveopment. Just like the first one. They are adding a bunch of content and seem to do regular fixes for the game.\n\nIt's free to play so try the game for yourself and try not to listen to people who are only ruining the games credit because of something they cannot comprehend.\n\nContracts are contracts. The law is the law.\n\nP.S. I have WAY more hours in ARK than DD2 so I'm not just some fanboy douching out over my favouritest game in the whole wide world, I'm giving an objective opinion based on the facts.\n\nHave a nice day!","March 24","true","58.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

After I finished the game and modded the crap out of it, I played dungeon defenders eternity and fell in love with it all over again.\n\nThis sorry excuse for a dungeon defenders game is just that. A sorry excuse. The graphics may be 'nicer' (I personally prefer the look the old games had), and it may be less prone to awkward crashes, but damn. At the very least, DDE had some half/decent gameplay to go along with it.\n\nBack to my point about being hooked at the first mission. I played through the tutorial level as the sorceror (which was my go to character considering how the summoner was yet to be implemented) and after putting up with the crappy enemy spawn times, the crappier enemy walking pace and the even crappier enemy damage (despite not having any armour at all), I uninstalled it and am glad it's no longer taking up space on my SSD. I did head back to the hub world, but got lost as to what I was doing. The UI was wonky and difficult to navigate, the new systems failed to improve the solid old ones and there was basically no point to having such a massive scale revamp.\n\nIt makes me even angrier that my favourite hero from DD1/DDE, The Summoner, had the one gimik that made his character interesting and different from the rest removed. In DD1/DDE, The Summoner had the ability to summon crystal versions of the enemies in place of towers. These crystal enemies has the ability to move and even chase enemies. Despite the AI for your minions being wonky and just plain broken at times, the gimik changed the flow of gameplay and allowed for such a dynamic sense of strategy. Suddenly, if my tower went down and I had no mana to replace it, I could choose to relocate some of my other minions to it's job. This was such a cool and different mechanic, and I loved it the instant I started using it.\n\nNOW, The Summoner (as of the writing of this review) has had his best quality removed. All his towers function like towers and blockades, which is a huge let down and a shame. On top of that, he lost his other two great abilities which allowed easy surveying of the battlefield, namely his "Phase Shift Overlord" ability, which turned the classic 3rd/1st person perspective into a top-down look of the entire battlefield. He could even summon and move minions from this perspective, once again adding to the extra gameplay elements. But NOPE, Trendy thought it would be a good idea to remove the interesting mechanics they had set up in the previous games.\n\nTrendy, get your act together. I'm happy that you're not actually charging anyone to trial what is essentially a shiny pile of garbage compared to your previous works, but seriously. What happen to the old magic, that made DD1/DDE so good?","April 10","false","0.2"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Regardless, I've played a lot of Early Access games, and this is the only one I seriously regret paying for.\n\nNot fun. Not worth it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fermis/recommended/236110/","Fermis","Fermis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fermis/","296 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst off this game is in alpha. This means that the game still has issues and isn't feature complete.\n\nTL;DR The game has a few issues but is still quite good.\n\nI have enjoyed this game so far it has many features I enjoy more than Dungeon Defenders 1.\n\nThe gathering mana system has greatly improved. Instead of going around to all the chests on the map you just have to interact with one. The other thing about the mana system that is a huge improvement is that you don't lose mana when you pick up a large chunk for example, if you only have space for 5 mana left and you picked up 10 in DD1 you would lose 5 mana in DD2 you gain 5 mana and 5 mana drops on your player. The only issue I have is with dropping mana, you can only drop 10 at a time and there is no drop all mana button.\n\nThe sub-core system is fantastic in my opinion. You can easily just build up around your main cores and deal with extra mobs released from destroyed sub-cores or you can spread your defenses out more, take that risk and the payout is a fair bit more exp.\n\nThe skill / tower build system now gives you four options instead of five. This is both a pro and a con to me. The fewer skills and fewer towers you have, the more balanced the game will be. This is because it will be that much simpler to balance, but on the other hand that extra skill or extra tower would be nice. The placement system for some of the monk's auras are slightly aggravating. If you build the monk's auras first you can then place traps or towers quite close to then, however if you build traps or towers first then you can't place the auora in the same spot as if you did the order the other way around. On a side note all the towers look quite nice.\n\nMob pathing seems to be fairly good. I have had a few issues where mobs get stuck behind the spawner wall and have had to use skills to kill them. I get the occasional mob stuck on a wall but as the game development progresses I am finding this to be less and less of an issue. Also flying kobolds are ♥♥♥ holes.\n\nThe maps are pretty exciting. They look quite nice and every map has it's environmental traps. The environmental traps can also be activated from a player shooting at it which is nice for when you can't get over there in time but there have been a few times when a stray shot has activated it. The maps are also where the game shows being in alpha a little bit. There are still a few ways to get outside of some of the maps, but as of the latest patch (November 21 2014) many of those have been fixed.\n\nSolo play versus group play is a huge difference. The ideal way to play this game is with a party of four. This is due to the item drop system giving higher chances to parties with more people in it.\n\nThe game still lacks a trade system that makes me sad, but it looks like it's coming. There are references to it in the config files for the game.\n\nI know there is content missing and I am looking forward to seeing how the game development progresses.","December 8, 2014","true","132.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

However I don't think that will change how I feel about the game, and here's why.\n\nI played DD1, and there are a lot of similarities. The problem is there's nothing new and exciting enough to draw me to playing DD2 instead of DD1. The four main classes are all basically the same with a few differences, but nothing has changed in their mechanics or the way you play them.\n\nCombos between towers show a lot of promise, but that alone isn't enough. All this work for building a new game seems like a waste of time to me if it's basically the same game.","December 28, 2014","false","32.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Should I have researched it a little more before I bought into it? Maybe but they had the repuation with the first game, and I figured they had the understanding that they had a good community behind them. Why charge me for early access when you just plan on releasing it free? Is that the thanks I get to help test your new crap business model? Thanks alot Trendy, you guys really made some moves to drag your name through crap. I no longer can recommend this game anymore than I recommend the first one.

After all you guys are trying to turn a succesful tower defense game with a great community backing you up into a crap MOBA, great work, you really did a fine job alienating every one of your original followers.\n\nTL;DR If you love the first game, stick with it, but I can't recommend this game, or any other game that they release, as they basically ripped everyone off.

Some might complain about this in comparison to DD1, but again, there will be more hero classes in the future.\n\n\nNeutral:\n- Non boostable leveling.  This is something that I can't quite tell if I like or not.  Allow me to exaplain...\n- In the first game, if you wanted to level up a character very quickly it could be done easily by setting up a defence with multiple high level heros and then switching to your level one to instantly hit around level 70 after maybe 4 waves, depending on your setup.  In DD2 this is not possible, your character level is capped with a maximum level difference between both characters of 5.\n\nCons:  Last time I played the game was still in Pre-Alpha, might be in Alpha now, and these cons will repesent the game in Pre-Alpha.\n\n- No kicking system.  Nothing grinds my gears more than when someone ques up for coop and afks.\n- No Pets.  I miss my treadmill buddies.  Maybe we'll get some elliptical pals this time around.\n- No survival mode as of yet, I'm sure they'll get around to it soon though.\n- No outfits yet, not much of a con.\n\nIt's very difficult to think of cons for this game.\n\nEventual pro:\nThe game will eventually become free to play with microtransactions for cosmetic overrides.  If you buy it now you'll recieve in game credit for what you paid!\n\nI highly recommend this game.

Game servers is laggy too, interface is non-convinient. Didnt had any chance to test gameplay in-deep because it eats all my memory and crashes. Also vsync not working. Uninstalled. 0/10 atm.\n\nOh, did I mention that this game is absolutely P2W?\n\nI mean F.UСК free to play P2W garbage games, which DD2 is right now. Stash space for money? Additional character slots? Seriously? This is just what I able to see by the time I was wandering around tavern and playing first map for a bit, but I guess since there is some kind of gems currency which you can buy - game is complete p2w garbage. Devs say you can only buy cosmetics with it, at the same time game wants your money for char slots and stash space.\n\nTower balance looks pretty poor at least on squire. In DD1 you could put, as I remember, 3 harpoons on starting map from all chests you got at first level (4+1 chests that give you 40 mana each and harpoon worth 80 I think). Here I just spammed some tower around crystal, I had enough mana to build like 8 towers on first level before first wave. Towers feel less important because of that, you just spam them everywhere because you cant even upgrade them before level 4.\n\nMap selection screen looks poorly made with really crappy models and overall worse than DD1's simple and good looking level interface.\n\nNo option to cancel this really annoying squire attack-step animation.\n\nTab key cant be rebinded (i guess its a console or something). Fix this please.\n\nSome weird chests appeared at the end of first mission which took about 10 seconds to appear in unskippable cutscene, then it took me a while to find a little area where I could press E to open middle chest (and why there is two gray chests around it?) and it dropped some loots.

Some might complain about this in comparison to DD1, but again, there will be more hero classes in the future.\n\n\nNeutral:\n- Non boostable leveling.  This is something that I can't quite tell if I like or not.  Allow me to exaplain...\n- In the first game, if you wanted to level up a character very quickly it could be done easily by setting up a defence with multiple high level heros and then switching to your level one to instantly hit around level 70 after maybe 4 waves, depending on your setup.  In DD2 this is not possible, your character level is capped with a maximum level difference between both characters of 5.\n\nCons:  Last time I played the game was still in Pre-Alpha, might be in Alpha now, and these cons will repesent the game in Pre-Alpha.\n\n- No kicking system.  Nothing grinds my gears more than when someone ques up for coop and afks.\n- No Pets.  I miss my treadmill buddies.  Maybe we'll get some elliptical pals this time around.\n- No survival mode as of yet, I'm sure they'll get around to it soon though.\n- No outfits yet, not much of a con.\n\nIt's very difficult to think of cons for this game.\n\nEventual pro:\nThe game will eventually become free to play with microtransactions for cosmetic overrides.  If you buy it now you'll recieve in game credit for what you paid!\n\nI highly recommend this game.  I love it.\nRecommend buying with friends!","February 16, 2015","true","69.8"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","6","13","2","1"

Game servers is laggy too, interface is non-convinient. Didnt had any chance to test gameplay in-deep because it eats all my memory and crashes. Also vsync not working. Uninstalled. 0/10 atm.\n\nOh, did I mention that this game is absolutely P2W?\n\nI mean F.UСК free to play P2W garbage games, which DD2 is right now. Stash space for money? Additional character slots? Seriously? This is just what I able to see by the time I was wandering around tavern and playing first map for a bit, but I guess since there is some kind of gems currency which you can buy - game is complete p2w garbage. Devs say you can only buy cosmetics with it, at the same time game wants your money for char slots and stash space.\n\nTower balance looks pretty poor at least on squire. In DD1 you could put, as I remember, 3 harpoons on starting map from all chests you got at first level (4+1 chests that give you 40 mana each and harpoon worth 80 I think). Here I just spammed some tower around crystal, I had enough mana to build like 8 towers on first level before first wave. Towers feel less important because of that, you just spam them everywhere because you cant even upgrade them before level 4.\n\nMap selection screen looks poorly made with really crappy models and overall worse than DD1's simple and good looking level interface.\n\nNo option to cancel this really annoying squire attack-step animation.\n\nTab key cant be rebinded (i guess its a console or something). Fix this please.\n\nSome weird chests appeared at the end of first mission which took about 10 seconds to appear in unskippable cutscene, then it took me a while to find a little area where I could press E to open middle chest (and why there is two gray chests around it?) and it dropped some loots. Well, easy to fix this, right?\n\nI have no idea why it gets so many positive rewiers, I guess people see that its free to play and happy about it, it also brings a lot of new people to the game.

I loved the game so much when I first began. All of the different class combos, strategy, loot, and overall fun. I quickly got all of my classes above level twenty and maxed out two of them. "Twelve dollars for this? Money well spent," I thought to myself. Turns out, I was wrong. Very wrong.\n\nAfter playing for a while, I started to lose steam due to the lack of a "real endgame" (which was a problem existing practically a YEAR ago that's still around today) I've seen talked about on other reviews here. I started logging in less and less, and by the time the full wipe (if anyone remembers that) came around, I had basically quit. Now, playing months later, after Trendy made this game free, I'm really sad to see where DD2 has gone. Just today they released the first new hero since launch, and it costs more than I payed for this game originally in real money, or over a month of farming!\n\nTrendy, what happened? Where are the old days of monk and hunter combos, nice (or at least talkative) strangers in matches, and real free content? The last two (maybe more) big updates require you to pay to get anything from them! And if that's not bad enough, they legitimately release more skins than content. That's not even hyperbole, just look at the shop. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this game went full DD1 and had you pay for maps (although in it's current state I would say DD1 is better). If you don't yet have the game, don't bother. If you do have the game and think that it's going somewhere, trust me and the hundreds (if not more) of others who thought the same thing only to be thrown under the bus because Trendy decided they want to make more money.

This is  NOT  an in-depth review and I'd just like to address my experience compared to other reviewers.\n\nOkay so, the first thing I want to address is the difficulty of the game. I've noticed a few reviewers talking about the difficulty of the game when it comes to playing solo. I myself enjoyed Dungeon Defenders 1 alone and rarely went online (partly due to the amount of hackers, but that's besides the point), so obviously I would be spending a vast majority of my time on this game offline or with a select group of friends, meaning if the game is much too hard for one person, I wouldn't be playing this game much at all, nor would I like it to be quite frank. However, as you can see, I've given this early access game a thumbs up. Why? Because it's not as hard in single player as others may believe. The entire game actually feels much easier overall compared to the original dungeon defenders.\n\nThe mechanic that stands out as to why it's easier, is that  you no longer have to stand next to your towers and wait to repair or upgrade them.  While it's true you still need to be close to the towers to begin the process of repairing or upgrading them, you still move freely, and can carry on fighting enemies or go elsewhere on the map while it's repairing. A little bar on the side of your crosshair shows you the progress of the repair/upgrade so you're still conscious of your tower in the meantime. You can only upgrade or repair one tower at a time, like in the original dungeon defenders, but the fact you can no guard the tower yourself while it's repairing for example, ends up helping you in the longrun. Personally, this is a very welcome change to the core game as it feels like I'm now doing more than just running around the map repairing my towers; It's more of an incentive to fight yourself.\n\nJust to let any readers know, I've tried out all four of the heroes ALONE and had little trouble beating the first few maps with each of them WITHOUT grinding for experience to level up nor switching between heroes mid-game. I'll admit, the huntress is a little hard to play solo as she uses traps, but as they're so small and use little mana, you can place many of them around before filling out the max tower limit. The Monk is clearly made to play as part of a team seeing as it has health and tower boosts, but he can still very well stand his own ground alongside his defenses. Oddly enough, the Squire and the Apprentice felt very similar, as their first two towers are ranged projectile defenses and barricades. When playing as either of them, by the time I got to the final wave, I could (and did, to prove it to myself) sit back and watch as my towers did all the work. In my opinion, that doesn't make playing as them "easy", it just means I created a defense that was effective on the map.\n\nMoving on, let me just say this game looks so much better than Dungeon Defenders 1. If you've seen the trailers or screenshots, as many of you have, you probably already know that. Besides the overall look and the new animations, it's just the little things I love most in games like this. On the first map, there's a tree with a squirrel on it, and sometimes it'll run down and jump on the fence posts and take a look around before running back up the tree. Things like that make the levels feel more unique and less hollow. Levelling up towers make them look drastically different, such as Squire's level 2 cannon getting taller and aining studs, or Apprentice's level 2 fireball shooter gaining eyes. This means you can know what level your tower is from a distance, just by looking at it, which is great for the fast-play action of this game.\n\nBottom line, this game takes everything from Dungeon Defenders 1 and improves on it. Gameplay feels smoother/more inviting, the whole game looks better, the enemies are fiercer and even the Tavern is vastly improved (don't get me started on the item upgrader, I love what they've done with it). However... content-wise, there's not a lot of replayability right now besides finding weapons, changing the difficulty of the available maps and switching up characters, and that is literally the only reason why any self-respecting tower-defense fan should not have this game already, in it's current state.\n\nFinal Verdict\nIf you're new to the Dungeon defenders franchise, then you should definitely go play the original game and wait for this game to become free-to-play. If you've played the original game, are a fan of the series, and want to help support the developers and watch this sequel go through it's development process, then you should get this game for sure, whether you want to play alone or with others.\n\nIf I didn't know any better, I would never have believed this game would be free-to-play, as the quality here is much too good compared to most current games in the field.","December 8, 2014","true","8.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Seeing as how its going to be free to play, I don't recommend paying for it unless you actually plan on influencing the game. I would much rather a game be a one time purchase and have a good game, rather then having in game shortcuts for real world money. They say they wont have anything in the shop that will effect the game, but I don't see that lasting long.\n\nTalking about the game now, the graphics got a major boost. Very pretty, and you don't need a massive build for your pc to play on max. The simplified skills and tower building is nice, as is the fact that upgrades are all one unified price.\n\n\nAs far as the forseeable issues... Crafting has taken a massive hit in the quality department, you used to just put mana into an item and choose a stat to boost, and mana as a currency has been removed, its now just gold coins, which is kinda dumb, and instead of the innkeeper selling you a selection of 3 items, the innkeeper is who you report bugs to, and you buy armor from some guy, and your trinkets from some other guy... now to upgrade items you just combine things till you can make a stat SLIGHTLY better... its not really worth upgradeing gear till end game.\n\nHaven't figured out how to change my character, or if i can even do that...haven't really looked into it, so I could just be being dumb...\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, they made it harder by making your towers far less effective, and make the enemies drop way less mana for your towers. They added a personal mana bar for your spells and abilities, so that was nice, instead of making you waste upgrades for towers on your spells.\n\nCompletely lost my train of thought just now, so I leave you all with what I have written.\n\n\nTl;Dr Its not as good as DD1, but will be worth playing when its free.","December 7, 2014","true","88.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

And I regret it a bit. The first thing is, that this game has a really poor performance for that little thing what they call 'graphics'. Sometimes this game drops under the 60FPS and this is really eye cancer on a 144Hz monitor. But, what about the gameplay? The gameplay is boring, and I didn't play the first game. But I heard from some friends, that the first game does make more fun than this. But as I can tell, this is good game to talk and play with your friends. But I think you could also play the first game and would have a lot more fun. Then I see, this game has ingame credits, which you can buy with real money. I hate this transactions and as I could see, they are for skins. SKINS. I can't understand why you should buy these, but hey, you get 4000 of these diamonds at the beginning! Now you can buy 2 or 3 skins and you can also open cases! Great thing. No, not really. If I would have paid for this, it would be a shame for me. I think you should better play the first game, really. But for those of you, that have fun with this game, have fun. I can't have it and I didn't play it for an hour.

I personally played DD1 quite a lot.\n\nAbout DD2:\n\nPros:\nF2P (Free To Play), with NO P2W (Pay to Win), Only Pay to boost, making life a lot easier, such as extra bags, more character slots and cosmetics, Defenders pack is worth it, and if you bought this a lot earlier you probably got some extra bags from that.  (I dunno if they will change this view)\n\nLess towers, Less characters than DD1, Making life simplier than DD1 end game, which was basically 1 misplace and you got ruined...\n\nIf you played DD1, and you liked it, then I highly recomend it.\n\nVery short Bugged Enemy Timer compared to DD1 which had like 10 minutes.... Yes that's a PRO!\n\nCons\n\nEXTREMELY limited build options at start of end game (NM1-NM2), requires specific gear, they are currently balancing drop rates, but I think the build options should be required at the end stage of Game rather than start of End Game\n\nGrinding, If you don't like it. I recomend you go away....\n\nVery small inventory space, in DD1 you had an entire Tavern to fill, Gems must be used to get more inventory sadly, I think its a con. but hey, at least you get to a F2P game.\n\nLaggy as hell sometimes {Doesn't matter computer}, please note that they state the game is in alpha, although the game content is like DD1 when they first released it, it has enough content to make you spend several hundreds of hours for grinding, but for just campaign? then no don't buy it.\n\nWould I recomend?\nDo you like Tower Defense in 3rd person?\nDo you like to DPS?\nDo you like to Grind?\nDo you like to Grind even more?\nAre you a grind-a-holic?\nDid you like Dungeon Defenders 1 (Or Eternity)\nDo you like Sanctum but wanted more of a fantasy setting?\nare you a Unreal Engine lover?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tigerhawkins/recommended/236110/","Tigerhawkins","TigerHawkins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tigerhawkins/","36 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI personally have not played the first Dungeon Defenders game, but I put a ton of hours into Dungeon Defenders Eternity, and saying I enjoyed the experience is an understatement. For something in Pre-Alpha, the amount of development that has happened in this game is extremely exceptional. What you get out of the game depends on what you put into it, and to be perfectly honest, I feel like I have put a decent amount into it.\n\nCompared to Dungeon Defenders Eternity, this game offers a variety of ways to play, since one aspect I particular enjoy is the synergy that certain defenses can undergo with one another. To name a few, There is the Geyser/Storm Combo, which can keep certain targets in place (some argue the combo is broken, but I could not care less on that point), and another combo is something I call Magic Shatter (people may call it something else) where you freeze a target, then send it airborne. The result is when they come back down, the target shatters, most of the time instantly killing it. The point is unlike in DDE, The defenses all seem to have a particular place, and do not seem to make any single tower worthless. (except for maybe the Squire's Training Dummy)\n\nThe gear in Dungeon Defenders 2 is already extremely versatile , with unique abilities to a certain item type that can greatly improve a player's performance, meanwhile in DDE, gear just improved tower and player stats directly. An example of some gear affixes are improving a specific tower performance, such as "Increased Flameburst Tower damage by 5.03%" making the item effectively an apprentice ideal item to improve his flameburst tower damage. This allows items to cater to specific classes, and once again improving the depth of the tower and also the character. There are some rarer mods that are extremely significant, so if you want to get truly powerful items, you have to be ready to hunt for them to get the best performance. Another thing I believe is improved compare to DDE is that gear is still able to be leveled, but leveling gear does not break the game as hard as it did in DDE. When you upgrade items, the stats will go up by a fixed amount every time, unlike in DDE, where the amount that the stat will increase is dependent on the stats the item had when it spawned.\n\n\nThe next thing I will address is the leveling system. The leveling system itself is pretty straight forward, you get experience by completing waves and defeating enemies, as well as completing certain conditions to gain fixed experience points and gold. That is pretty standard, but it's a good system. The thing that I believe that DD2 has done amazingly is that instead of being able to allocate points to character and tower stats directly as a result of leveling up, the character and tower stats go up automatically, and once you reach level 5, you gain 2 points that you can put into passive skills to improve your characters performance in a series of ways. For example, the Squire is able to place points into an ability that gives his spike barricades a chance to stun enemies when they attack targets. The more points you put into a skill, the more effective it becomes. As you put more points in, the results will have diminishing returns, so a player can decide when enough is enough, and begin skilling other abilities. Furthermore, you can completely respec your skills for free at any time, so long as you are not in the middle of a wave, allowing you to test out various builds and find a setup that suits you. Each character has 6 skills you can invest in.\n\n\nThe next thing I will address is the enemies. A few of the classic enemies make their return, goblins, orcs, wyverns, etc. The enemies still come from a variety of spawn points, where a variety of enemies will come out of each one. Those enemies were great in DDE, and most of them return in DD2. The enemy cast also expands, offering new challenges to overcome. One particular subject that has received mixed criticism is that some enemies have the ability to attack towers from outside of the common tower's attack ranges. This makes the game a bit more of a puzzle, due to the fact that unlike in DDE, tower ranges can't be increased to such an obscene level to counter absolutely everything that the map may throw at you. This does not break the game, there are still measures that the player can take to manage the various enemies, both old and new.\n\nThe final subject I will touch on is the Co-op play. I never went to public taverns and went looking for people to play with, so I won't comment too much on public matchmaking, but I have friends I have played with, and this game is just as awesome in Co-op as it is in solo play. If you have friends that you know and can communicate with, the experience is far more satisfying. The enemies will scale with the number of party numbers, both in health and overall difficulty, making it a perfect game to either play solo, or bring in some of your friends to go beat down the Old One's armies.\n\n\nTo conclude, for a game in its Pre-Alpha state, I believe this game is exceptional, and will go far. The devs are working to update the game, listening to feedback, and working to balance the game. Some things in the game still need fixing, some things still need to be balanced, but the game is still very young, and I am certain it will develop into a memorable classic. It will turn into a F2P at launch, but to be perfectly honest, I don't mind having paid for the game. I'm actually glad to have paid, because it's a way people can say "thank you" to the creators, especially since the game will be free at launch unless something changes that. In a nutshell, if you enjoyed the first Dungeon Defenders, I would assume you would enjoy DD2, the same holds true for Dungeon Defenders Eternity.","February 1, 2015","true","875.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","8"

Offcourse it could be so much better, but let's remember they are still working on it.\nCan you compare the game to DD1? Partly, and that is what frustrates the DD1 players. You have to look at this as another game enterily.\nCan you play the game without spending real cash? yes you can enjoy everything playwise, you can buy costumes which cost tons of money. And with the carnival update you can "buy" older monthly pets, like bearkira. Why the quotes, well you buy tickets for the carnival game, and you have fixed rewards which include bearkira.\nDid I buy gems, yes, as I enjoyed the game very much and I want to support the creators.\nDo I hope the game evolves and get's better? Yes very much, and I'll be playing/following this game closely.\nBefore this game I was an avid mmorpg lover, but all the mmorpg are just bland and boring.\nThis is a mix between tower defense and rpg and I love that part as it keeps making to come back.\n\nI have high expectations for the game.\n\nSo if you like tower defense games with a few rpg elements, this might be it.\n\nEnjoy it, as it is free\n","February 23","true","452.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

And it can be as challanging as you want.\n\nIt is a free game which makes friends try out the game more appealing.\n\nAlso, Its not paytowin or anything like that, you can grind out free skins  by doing daily and montlhy quests.\nLacks a bit of endgame once you hit level cap, gets grindy too. but thats doesnt mean its a bad thing.","February 23","true","60.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

A few short months later, I was left with a free game that I wouldn't enjoy touching on, with only 4 hours I don't have a majority when it comes to hours yet I feel the game needs more to fit what I expect. With it being free I can see people playing the game as it fits a titles like this, yet it doesn't compare to the greatness I experienced from it's predecesor. - Pengz ;[","February 7","false","4.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"
