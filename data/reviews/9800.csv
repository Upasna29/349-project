And if it didn't had an unlimited save option on the last difficulty, it was going to be a lot harder than any of the Hitman games. This game is definitly not for everyone. It is one of the hardest stealth games ever made and shooting your way out is impossible on most of the missions. The game has the wonderful stealth feauture of hiding in plain sight by using different disguises to infiltrate enemy areas. But most of the places are so crowded, that you will find it very hard to remain undetected, even if you take an unique disguise. Getting a disguise is not easy, enemies are hard to be distracted most of the times and after getting distracted, they can become very unpredictable, so you have to be very patient. Things I liked about the game are:\n+ this is a pure stealth game that combines a lot of elements from other stealth games\n+ disguises work significantly well, as long as you don't do anything suspicious;\n+ things like running, crouching or crawling are suspicious, so you cannot act strange in front of your enemy and hope you can get away with it;\n+ in order for you disguise to work, as a Russian spy, you must only carry enemy German weapons or they will detect you;\n+ disguises work only if they are acquired after sedating, strangling or stunning an enemy, which means you cannot shoot someone, take his clothes and expect to fool someone else, while the outfit is covered in blood;\n+ if enemies get alerted after sounding an alarm, like when they found an unconscious body for example, this will automatically mean you can no longer use stealth as an onption because enemies know there is something very wrong with the situation and won't be fooled again. So you must be stealthy all the time, in order to complete most of the missions;\n+ you have a lot tools at your disposal like chloroform for sedating, strangling wire, pliers, knifes, pitlocks, explosives, snipers an other other guns and most of the times, you can choose what you need the at the start of every mission;\n+ the minimap and the detection meter are very helpful to complete the mission;\n+ you have a rating system that monitors your playstyle like in the Hitman franchise\nThings I didn't like about the game are:\n- you don't have that much of a freedom like in the Hitman titles;\n- they can detect you too easily at times, especially when enemies tend to stare at you for no reason.\n- characters seem to be communicating with each other, but you can never hear real actual conversations\n- the story is very weak, so if you are looking for a good plot in the WW2 era and a motive to complete the levels to see what happens next, this is not the case\n- the character you play as is also too plain. You won't hear him say anything during the missions and you won't find him interesting at all like Agent 47 from the Hitman games.\n- the game was not polished and it has some technical issues\nOverall, this game was not fully developed. It has some very interesting and challenging gameplay and most of the times, it surpasses the gameplay of other stealth games especially in realism, but due to the fact that the game was made with a low budget, it wasn't developed to be a top-selling title. I only recommend this game to people who really enjoy playing stealth games, especially Hitman fans.","November 16, 2013","true","104.5"," 114 of 122 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","114","122","0","4"

Most of the characters in-game are lacking any sense of real voice acting.\nMost blatantly the international version of the game is censored to not include swastikas or Hitler portraits.\nThere are NO subtitles whatsoever, and the few english voice actors they brought on to do cutscene work are absolutely monotone, beneath even Bethesda level.\n\nThankfully, if you're in love with stealth games, all of this is trumped by the frankly insane amount of work put into the game's levels and mechanics. You will probably never find a stealth game that's as hard, yet as fair as this one.\nYou will work for HOURS finding the perfect disguise and route to penetrate the ONE small hole in security the developers made for you, and you will ♥♥♥♥ing LOVE it.\n\nThat said? If you don't feel like spending loads of time, patience and thought on any given level in a stealth game, you're probably playing the wrong one.\nDeath to Spies has levels so difficult and guarded that the game expects a degree of lethality, rewarding the best rating in spite of 10 or so guards killed at times. This makes it fairly unique amongst the game's peers in that while it doesn't encourage lethality, it makes it a necessity rather than shunning murder altogether.\n\nIf you like tough as nails, yet fair and complex stealth games to the point that you can tolerate questionable delivery? Pick this game up.\nYou owe it to yourself.","August 3, 2015","true","68.2"," 89 of 90 people (99%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","99","89","90","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/n0cl1p/recommended/9800/","n0cl1p","Profit-Prophet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/n0cl1p/","15 products in account","You are a Soviet counterintelligence agent reliving his memories of sabotage / assassination assignments for SMERSH through flashbacks during an interrogation. The storyline is scattered, as it features select important missions from the spy's CV. Each mission is thus standalone and the main character remains the mysterious strong & silent type. The graphics and controls remind me a lot of Mafia 1 and Max Payne 1 and 2. The shooting accuracy is very messy (not smooth). The game is undemanding and runs smoothly even on older / weaker rigs. Despite it being set in WWII, you won't get that "nazi bashing" feel you get with most games set in that era. DTS is a long enough (will take you 10-12 hours to comlete), stealth-oriented game, so you get lots of rewards for acting qietly - infiltrating enemy compounds, silently disposing of bodies and walking around in enemy uniforms, for the obtainment of which you get a rich array of tools (strangling cord, cloroform, poison, throwing knives, silenced weapons, distraction tools and opportunities, whistling, etc) and you get a rating for your work at the end of each mission.\n\nA lot of people and gaming magazines claim the game is overly difficult, and it is not due to the quality of AI. As a matter of fact, the game is difficult mostly due to their quantity. Some missions are literally spammed with civvies and soldiers (who are immune to spatial awareness) to the point where you can't reach your objective on time. Don't get me wrong, even on the easy difficulty, the AI has excellent sight, hearing and identifying capabilities. The higher up you go in uniform, the less suspicion you arouse. Enemies will also recognize foreign weapons and backpacks. Trigger an alarm and you'll have to redo a whole section. Save, save, save. I normally have around 7-10 saves per mission and each mission is about an hour long, mostly because of unknown variables, such as random civvies / soldiers walking in, or you walking in on an uncomfortable set of enemies. You'll spend a lot of time scheming and waiting for an opportunity to strike and hide a body, or a window to run past a diplomat, pick his safe and replace his documents. Compared to other stealth games like Splinter Cell, Death to Spies is more "wooden" and realistic in terms of the human limitations your character has - get in trouble once and it's over. He can't even climb stuff other than ladders. He's just a regular guy, and that makes fooling an entire enemy base such a rewarding experience.","November 25, 2014","true","26.6"," 48 of 50 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","48","50","0","6"

It is very different from your average WWII game which there's a lot of shooting.  This game involves careful planning and stealth.  You will find yourself dead very quickly if you start shooting.  I will discuss this game under these heading:\n\nLEVELS: There are 10 levels in total.  Most of them take at least 1 hour to complete.  The levels include; a German concentration camp, a British hotel, an American military base and a German military school.  A detailed tutorial mission can be done at the start of the game.\n\nDISGUISES: Disguises are an important element of this game.  Most levels you start off in Soviet military camouflage clothes.  German soldiers will immediately start shooting at you until you get a disguise.  There are different disguises available.  A German soldier is the most basic disguise.  Most German soldiers will not bother you but higher ranks may see through your disguise.  Some levels require you to get officer's uniforms, staff's clothes (e.g. a chef) or a worker's clothes.\n\nWEAPONS: Before you start each level you can fully customise your equipment.  You can carry a shoulder, side and a knife weapon.  Main weapons include MP40s, MP44s and Stens.  Many pistols are also available.  The silenced pistol is he most useful.  Knifes can be carried - they can be used at close range or thrown.  For silent kills you are equipped with a choke cord and chloroform.  You can also punch people, although this is nosier.\n\nVEHICLES: Vehicles can be driven in some missions.  Trucks, motorbikes and cars can be driven.\n\nUI: You can swap between a main map and a mini-map.  You can use the + and - keys to zoom in and out.  The AI are shown as green, yellow, red and grey icons; green meaning no suspicion of you, yellow - vary (don't stay around these guys too long!), red - alert, usually if they see you they will raise the alarm and grey - civilians.  A suspicion meter appears at the top of the screen when guards are suspicious of you.  If this fills the alarm will be raised.\n\nAI: There are many different types/appearances of AI people, though they aren't great.  Once you start shooting they tend to run around crazily until they compose themselves.  Mostly they're OK though.\n\nSound: The sound is good in this game.  German music can be heard coming from gramophones and the environmental sound are good.  The AI are pretty wordless.  This is improved in the sequel Moment of Truth (they say  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  to you if you're dressed as an officer!)\n\nOTHER: You can pick locks, spy through keyholes, sabotage functions to distract attention away and more.\n\nThis is a great game I recommend you buy it (wait for a sale somewhere - and get the Gold Edition, it works out cheaper).  If you like a game with lots of pace and action this may not be the game for you.\n","May 18, 2014","true","34.2"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","0"

It is certainly a challenge. It is not a "shoot anything that moves" game, rather, it is more of a game of stealth. I started the game on easy mode, and figured I could just charge in and shoot all the enemies to complete the mission, like you would do in a call of duty type game. I ended up dead realy quick. it took me about 5 hours just to complete the first mission, but it did not get boring. Buy this game, or better yet, buy the Gold bundle and play both the games.

However, if you are a big stealth fan like myself, then you will get some enjoyment out of this game. That enjoyment is limited though, and I'll explain.\n\nIf you've played the Hitman series, Death to Spies should instantly remind you of it. You're walking around open areas with multiple paths and disguises are a vital aspect of the gameplay. The difference is that Hitman does it a lot better. The disguise system in this game is a strange beast - you can wear multiple disguises in each level, usually 2 or 3, and usually one will be "better" than the other - as in, there will be less "red" enemies who are able to see through your disguise. The whole thing doesn't really make sense - some enemies, for whatever unexplained reason, know you're a spy. I've completed the game from start to finish and I still don't really get it.\n\nThis game is also mercilessly difficult and frustrating. I won't say "challenging" - because that implies you have to think deeply and strategically about what you're actually doing. Most of the time, you'll have quick save and quick load at the ready, doing things in hope rather than guile and seeing if they actually work. The game leaves you very little hints or clues about how to achieve your objectives, which I know some will love as they hate the idea of "hand-holding", but it isn't a black-and-white concept - there is a middle ground where the game can both help you out and you can think for yourself how to solve situations. Other stealth games like Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid get that middle ground, while this unfortunately doesn't. People who dislike stealth games often criticise popular titles in the genre for being trial and error games - and yet, as a stealth fan who's played most games in the genre, I found this overly trial and error based. I don't think I've ever looked at a walkthrough as much as I did on this game as often I was left wondering how I was actually supposed to complete my objectives.\n\nJust to add insult to injury, the game is rife with bugs and glitches. You'll find yourself getting stuck in walls and tiny unexitable areas. You might experience a glitch where the camera is in a completely opposite direction to where your character is moving. Oh yeah, and the music in the intros is incredibly loud, so you've got that to enjoy whenever you launch the game.\n\nOne area where Death to Spies does deserve credit is the map design - these maps are unusually large for stealth games and is a great change from dark, linear areas in many stealth games. However, there's nothing to do in these areas - if you want to complete the missions, there's always some linear path that is by far the simplest way to complete the missions. The game makes it far too difficult for you to actually use these open areas so you can complete a mission a different way from someone else.\n\nDespite all these issues, I still had fun with Death to Spies, and other stealth fans will feel the same. Credit has to go to the developers, as you can see they tried - the poor English grammar due to the game being a low-budget Russian title adds to the appeal a little. Unfortunately, the game is just plagued with too many flawed gameplay mechanics to make it enjoyable for the general gaming populace - and it's that which kills it.","October 10, 2014","false","19.9"," 32 of 53 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","32","53","3","4"

Enemies will respond accordingly to mostly all of your actions on the field but I recommend stealthing this game fully as the A.I. can become brainless when you are caught. They run around aimlessly and constantly chuck grenades at you. The game is definitely meant to be played silently and it is way more rewarding this way.\nDeath to Spies has you tackling Nazi prison camps, bases and even tasks you with destroying an entire bridge to cut of enemy reinforcements to the front lines as well as a few other locations I will leave to you to find out for yourself. Do not expect anything exciting from the story and dialogue as that does not seem to be a huge focus in Death to Spies. Character voice acting and lip to voice synchronization is a mess but I did not let that take away from the stories I created within each individual mission.\nTo say the least, Death to Spies is truly underrated and was lost in the shadows of Hitman.

God, this game was hard!\n\n'Death to Spies' puts you in the shoes of Russian counter-intelligence agent Semion Strogov who, whilst under interrogation, re-lives the covert operations he undertook as field agent. Mission objectives range from assassinating high-ranked enemy officers including spies, traitors and deserters, stealing secret documents and missile/weapon plans from scientific facilities, freeing (or assassinating) prisoners from concentration camps/lock-ups and blowing up bridges.\n\nThe game is divided into ten missions, none of which are inter-linked in any way. Similar to other games of the stealth genre, disguises are an essential part of gameplay. The protagonist can change into any enemy (or civilian) uniform provided the fabric isn't damaged via acts of shooting or stabbing. Enemies, depending upon their ranks, can see through disguises so it is better to don the disguise of a high-rank official to pass unscathed.\n\nGunplay and explosives are barely functional so don't expect to complete missions Rambo-style. Enemies converge from all sides the moment you're spotted and a huge barrage of them bring you down within seconds. A silenced revolver, muffled sniper-rifle, chloroform rag or knife are usually all that is required but useful ammo is scarce so essential targets have to be chosen wisely. Stunning enemies produces noise in a limited area around which could alert nearby adversaries. Knives can be thrown, with their trajectory depending upon the intended target's distance from you.\n\nAn overhead radar map shows enemy positions with vision cones that exhibit their fields of view, which may either contract or elongate depending upon the protagonists posture. Whistling and smoke bombs are efficient methods to distract enemies, making them leave their positions. Running also produces noise which can result in an enemy sentry come investigating. Discovery of enemy bodies results in the alarm being raised which might fail the mission or consequently increase the number of highly-alert patrols.\n\nEnvironment interaction is extremely restrictive which makes missions all the more harder. I've often looked at windows/ledges and wished they could be opened or accessed in some way. Actions have to be timed perfectly to fulfill objectives. A few vehicles can be driven but they have little use unless driving them is part of the mission objective. Enemy bodies can be picked up and stoved inside boxes or trucks. Drinks can be poisoned on more than a few occasions. And locks can be picked through a fun, yet challenging mini-game.\n\nThe game is gorgeous, if you don't go over the textures with a magnifying. There are a variety of locales which include wide open camps with buildings that can be entered, academic institutes, bombed-out towns, scientific facilities, hotels and an embassy. And the period attention to detail is flawless and extremely well done.\n\nDeath to Spies is a deeply flawed game. What makes the game so frustrating at times is its restrictive gameplay elements. I've heard its sequel has improved upon a lot of areas. It requires some time and effort to calculate one's next move and the quicksave/quickload button would be abused mercilessly. But regardless, completing missions is a very rewarding experience.","May 27, 2015","true","36.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It can be difficult to gauge how obscured you are, and once the alarms are raised, there's practically no chance of escape or success... Howeverthe levels are large and open, and it's very clear which disguises will work on who.  There are none of the clever machinima interstitials that suggest optimal methods to eliminate targets that Himan relies on; instead you're left to figure out the best course of actions through your wits alone, and this can be no easy task.  The graphics can be convincing at times, and are above average for a small-studio game from 2009, but everything's rough around the edges, from weather effects, to the ambient noise in rooms.  This is definitely a "great for what it is" kind of game, so don't expect a triple-A title.","September 16, 2014","true","19.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's pretty difficult and unpolished, so I'd just recommend it for more hardcore stealth fans who can look over a relatively steep learning curve (I didn't have much trouble, but many other people seem to) and an overall lack of polish. If you can get over that, Death to Spies is a really fun game. I especially like the overall atmosphere. My only complaints are that it's relatively short (especially Moment of Truth) and that missions don't seem to have as much replayability as in Hitman.

The levels are huge and well thought out, dispite the WW2 setting you get to sneak around some very nice and often quite exotic places including an old medieval castle straight out of Wolfenstein.\n\nStory:The story is about as good as its competitors in the genre. Think of the Hitman series up until Blood Money or Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. It is told through the main character reciting what he was doing behind enemy lines to a member of the KGB.\n\nGameplay and Feel:The mechanics are solid and easy to get used to, levels have no element of randomness, they will behave the same way every time you restart them. While this may hurt replayability, it insures that you will not be screwed out of a successful run of the mission because the game didn't play by its own rules. The game comes with a full inventory management system which is what separates it from the Hitman series, you can only carry so much with so many pockets and things stored in your rucksack aren't immediately availible when you need them.\n\nDifficulty:I'm currently playing through the original Hitman: Codename 47 and I've completed Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, I would say that Death to Spies is easier than both of them but for the right reasons. Death to Spies does a great job of making sure you know what you need to be achieveing and even presents you with options for completing it, but the game doesn't play itself, it'll expect that you know how to get to where you need to be and you'll find yourself trying alternatives to the obvious. I found each level needed to be replayed about 2 to 4 times in order to get it right.\n\nScrew Stealth what else is there on offer?:The combat is pretty standard for a third person shooter of the day, no cover based shooting, no regenerating health, just you, your ammo, and your guns (think Sniper Elite). Guns sound nice and satisfying, and as you are fighting soldiers there is enough ammo in most levels to blast your way through. However in levels like the Hotel level you will find you are lacking firepower, and as your targets also lack their own personal army they will often run instead of going searching for you.\n\nWhat is the Tutorial like?:If you are new to the stealth/spy genre (not to be confused with pure stealth or stealth action) then I can confidently tell you that this isn't the deep end, but it's no paddling pool either. You'll find the tutorial pretty compresensive, but slow. I don't recommend skipping it even if you are a veteran of the Hitman or Splinter Cell games, as there are differences in mechanics that can open possibilities you wouldn't otherwise know about.","September 1, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

For example, most dead NPC's uniforms can be stolen and worn. Be warned though: This game is hard! I don't play many stealth games, but even on the lowest difficulty, the enemy's suspicion meter seems to increase very quickly and easily. One thing that makes stealth hard is that silent takedowns are hard to perform. When you crouch run behind the enemy to complete a takedown, their suspicion raises to full almost instantly. If you screw up here, the guard will turn around and quickly unload a mag and kill you. Another thing, which I have yet to see in another stealth game, is that when you are disguised and walk into a guard's "cone of vision", their cone of vision will follow you for a time because they are watching you, which could lead to the suspicion meter growing. Also, even when disguised, like in hitman, higher ranked NPC's will get suspicious of you faster.\n\nSo far, I have not completely finished any level stealthily, as I'm not very patient. Instead, I use more of a run-and-gun playstyle with a small mix of stealth. So far there have not been any stealth requirement levels, but I expect one might come up. One thing to note if you plan on run and gunning is that the guns are realistic in terms of recoil. Holding down the trigger for more than 2 seconds will send your sights flying upwards, so you will find yourself clicking your left mouse button for every shot to be accurate, even on smgs.\n\nOne con that I have noticed is that on multiple occasions, I would stealth kill one guard, and then the body gets found. Normal, right? Well, if there are five or six guards nearby, and they all see the body, they will run to it and start searching nearby. This system makes it so that at times, one body will make multiple guards clump around it and make easy targets of themselves. A couple of times, I've thrown a grenade at these groups and gotten multiple easy kills.\n\nAnother problem is that if you camp in a one enterance area and hold your crosshairs on the door, wave after wave of guards will come running through the door idiotically, and run right into your spray. The only way they can prevent this, is if they see you, they will sometimes throw a grenade at you (Instant death, no matter how much health). The problem with this is if you are camping a door, you will most likely spray them down before they have time to throw a grenade. Because of this exploit, after several camping sessions, the door way would literally have a heap of 10 to 15 corpses.\n\nAnother complaint I have is that when driving cars, going reverse will make the camera akwardly look down, then back. Also if you are reversing, the camera gets locked looking backwards, meaning that you cannot look in fromt of you while reversing, and vice-versa (this mechanic gets really annoying specially when you are trying to escape guards and can't look at them unless you are driving towards them.\n\nAlso, if you are worried about content, you don't have to. At the time of me typing this, I have run-and-gunned my way through 3 missions in 9 hours (though I did make it my mission to kill all the nazis on all of those maps, even the ones that were out of the way) Plus, these levels are highly replayable, as you can choose your loadout at the start. You can choose any combination of equiptment you want through a weight system.\n\nBecause of the difficulty in stealth, health system (no regen and only one full health medkit-sometimes none-per level) and shooting mechanics, this game really is hardcore stealth-action.\n\n\nFor me, Death to Spies is a steal a $10 for any stealth, action, or WW2 fan!\n\n\n\nOh, and also, lots of people say their game is buggy beyond playability, but I haven't experienced any game-breaking bugs yet.

I personally like stealth and espionage games therefore this game fell right into my domain.\n\nMission design is pretty good and allows for a variety of approaches. Voice acting is a bit off in the intro scenes of each mission in terms of quality. It is not carried out throughout missions which is a good thing.\n\nDynamics are added that will not allow you to wear an enemy's outfit if you put a bullet through it however sometimes it glitches out and won't let you change costumes even with headshots (I tested this out since I saved before trying to obtain an officer's outfit and I was able to get it in my 4th or 5th attempt).\n\nPhysics seem good and the graphics are not bad for a game that was created in 2007. The graphics are pretty good actually.\n\nThe AI is okay as well; not dumb but not super alert as well (this may differ on your difficulty settings).\n\nThe retail price of $4.99 seems to be quite a good price for this game. I got Death to Spies: Moment of Truth but I have yet to play and possibly review that game too so I cannot say if $12.99 is worth the two games or not; if it does go on a sale the 2 game bundle may be worth it.\n\nRating - 8.2/10","July 15, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

On one hand, you will dive into a series of detailed and fairly open maps, stealthily accomplishing complicated tasks. On the other hand, your patience will be tested as you scum saves and restart missions again and again, because the difficulty level is just brutal even on easy.\nHonestly, although the graphics are dated and the mechanics are clunky, the detection system is one of the most realistic I've found, forcing you to forget your previous notions of darkness=concealment, and sneak based on line of sight and noise. The gameplay is easy to get used to, and after a while may get repetitive, but it is moderately worth buying.

Plays like a cross between "Hitman" and the old "Commandos" games, but it also has some unique twists on the genre that make it stand out. The missions are nicely varied, complex, and are refreshingly light on the hand holding. Often times you are dumped in a field outside of a city with nothing but a map, leaving you to tackle objectives as you wish. Likewise, while it's not quite the ultra realistic stealth game I've always been dreaming of, there are some nice nods to reality here and there (for example, you can't wear uniforms if you've bloodied them and guards will sometimes recognize you regardless of your disguise). Of course it does have the silly "choke dude for 2 seconds, dude sleeps for hours" mechanic, but there are also dozens of more realistic ways to take people out as well, so it's optional.\n\nThe writing is dry, production values are low, and it has some bugs, but it's worth a try if you want stealth that's a bit more demanding.\n","July 30, 2012","true","30.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

And what about old splinter cells? Did you enjoy them? Okey then, you will enjoy this game too.\n\nGame and story setting is unique and you probably have'nt seen anything like that before. Levels atmosphere are great and game mechanics will remind you some of the most iconic old school stealth games. Game gives you freedom to choose your approach through levels, you can choose your equipment before starting missions, levels are big enough so you can pick a strategy, there's no "Mission Failed" after raising alarm so you can always try "Plan B". So what are you waiting for, just buy the game and jump into the missions... NO, wait a second.\n\nThere's a show-stopper issue which will not let you to proceed into levels. When character enters an "Indoor" place, such as rooms, bunkers, etc. two things happen:\n\n1st) It reduces character movement speed so much, even when character is in the running state. It feels like character has been stuck between some invisible walls and just keep colliding with them. In this situation when I use jumping button, character just begins to fly in the room and it seems that Gravity Scale has been set so close to zero.\n\n2nd) At default condition, when character is faced forward (Local Rotation = 0), camera is just set behind the character. While player is changing camera position in Indoors and also moving the character, the relation between camera position and character rotation gets messy. Some of players have found some solutions to reset camera/player relation (like entering a vehicle) but they aren't some proper way to keep playing the game.\n\nAs I'm writing this review, this major bug can still be find in game.

The other game breaking bug that I encountered was the character getting stuck for no reason within any interior location.

Death to Spies is, without question, the absolute worst of these games.\n\nI say this with no sense of hyperbole. This game fails to implement even the most basic move and shoot gameplay elements competently.\n\nI challenge anyone to finish the tutorial without quitting in a fit of range. It's the basic "shoot these types of weapons and then throw some grenades" military game tutorial with a few additional quirks. First, the way your avatar is facing and moving has only a tangential relationship to where the mouse is pointing. Second, once you get into the indoor firing range, there are invisible and intermittent impediments to your movement that have you running in place for seconds at a time. Finally, should you manage to actually pick up and fire a gun (no small feat), you can move your cursor over the target, press the fire button, all while your avatar is visibly firiing a gun at a 90 degree angle from said targets.\n\nThere are other niggling things that I could go on about: there's the fact that Russian characters in a Russian-made game speak in stilted American accents. There's the poor-man's Hitman inventory system, and the way that the whole map is alerted if one lone soldier spots you. But all of this pales in comparison to the fact that the TUTORIAL IS THE SINGLE MOST ONEROUS GAMING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER SUFFERED THROUGH.\n\nNobody ever playtested this game. Nobody should have ever released this game. I would say it is funny, but I paid fractions of a dollar for this game, I invested almost an entire hour of my life into this, so I will just say do not play this game. If you do, please make a video of your tutorial experience and send it to me.","January 1, 2014","false","0.6"," 10 of 32 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","10","32","0","0"

Unfortunately, the reviews claiming that it is buggy - the reviews I didn't see before purchasing - are accurate.  The game seems to have a glitch that causes you to lose your ability to move when nearing an obstacle - namely walls, corpses, trees, or, well, anything else that you can stub your toe on.  With some patience and maybe a little grease, you can get your character unstuck from these situations.  Unfortunately, you will then face the glitch in which your character is aiming about 45° off-screen to the right.\n\nI tried restarting the tutorial mission then the game, but that did not help.  I thought maybe it was just an issue with the tutorial level, but it persisted on the first mission.  I uninstalled and reinstalled the game, and I was disappointed to see that the issues were still there.\n\nTL;DR:  The game seems fun, but the glitches and bugs outweigh that.","November 3, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some enemies will just simply detect you (or not) depending on how the game feel. An enemy will be deaf and won't hear you breathing down his neck, or won't see you in his peripheral vision depsite you being in plain light, very visible. The very same enemy can detect you someties if you're out of his range (marked on the map), on a different elevation than him (you're uphill, he's downhill) and laying down in the grass with a camouflage suit.\n\nAnd even when you finally get a disguise, you're not out of trouble and will continiously be frustrated by the way the disguise system works.\nOnce again, if it is good in theory, its application ruins it.\n\nBasically, when you are disguised you are authorized to be in certain area or perform certain action (an outer patrol isn't authorized in buildings), you won't fool commanding officers that are directly related to the disguise you're wearing (ex: the chief for outer patrols will spot you in an outer patrol uniform but the chief for inner patrols won't) and you need to carry the standard issue guns related to your uniform (while wearing a german guard uniform, wielding a Tokarev will get you spotted but an MP40 won't)\nI told you, it seems really interesting on paper.\n\nBut in-game, while the interface will pop a message when equiping a weapon that doesn't fit the uniform, there's little to none indicator to what zones or actions are restricted to the uniform you just stole as most uniforms you can steal are by definition those of soldiers in secluded area and thus were not interacting or meeting other soldiers. How can you know if you can enter a building with your current uniform? The guard will tell you that you can't enter. If there's no guard, you enter and meet someone inside? They'll shoot you, no question asked. Same goes for most interactions.\nThis makes the whole inflitration more based on trial and error rather than on observation.\n\nIn brief, Death to Spies could have been so good, but ended up falling short on most of features.\nA waste of potential: 44/100","October 18, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, the reviews claiming that it is buggy - the reviews I didn't see before purchasing - are accurate.  The game seems to have a glitch that causes you to lose your ability to move when nearing an obstacle - namely walls, corpses, trees, or, well, anything else that you can stub your toe on.  With some patience and maybe a little grease, you can get your character unstuck from these situations.  Unfortunately, you will then face the glitch in which your character is aiming about 45° off-screen to the right.\n\nI tried restarting the tutorial mission then the game, but that did not help.  I thought maybe it was just an issue with the tutorial level, but it persisted on the first mission.  I uninstalled and reinstalled the game, and I was disappointed to see that the issues were still there.\n\nTL;DR:  The game seems fun, but the glitches and bugs outweigh that.","November 3, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You manage your mission loadout with a weight and item slot limit forcing you to carefully decide what you need without being too punishing. You can scrape through a mission any way you need to. The challenge is nice without being impossible, and you can salvage a situation as quickly as you can screw it up. One weird thing about this game is that it doesn't recognize MMB as an input. not too big a deal since there aren't so many controls that you'll be all over your keyboard.","March 5","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some examples are: Infiltration in Los Alamos Lab to gather intelligence about the nuclear project of US, and the assassination of Nazi officers in an Abwehr Intelligence School in Krakow.\n\nA very interesting game, the interface may be a llitle clunky but you will get used to it, many people say that this game is hard, so I recommend to play on easy and use guides. I think you will find this game very satisfying even if you are not a fan of stealth games.\n\nThere is no much story in the game, the goal and end of the interrogation of Strogov is not revealed in this game and I am not soure if this is concluded in the sequel.\nIn any case the missions are interesting by themselves so I recommend this game.","June 27, 2015","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
