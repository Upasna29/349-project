Stephen King\nVenon's legacy puts you in the shoes of a man named Robert, he learns of his uncles death and returns to the uncles estate Dunkenhof manor.  Upon reaching the manor he notices something is amiss as no one is around to greet him, he finds a letter on the nearby table and this sets you out on a journey to find out what happened at your uncles estate in the years since you've been gone.  The story unfolds via letters left behind by the estates residents who are now conspicuously missing.  The game plays out like many other walking simulators as no combat exist in the game, instead you're greeted by a eerie atmosphere and music, which often times leaves the gamer on the edge of his seat waiting to see what pounces out at him behind the next locked door.\n\nThe game can be both frustrating and rewarding at the same time, many of the puzzles are riddles hidden in the pages you've found, others seem to be complete random and require a ton of guess work.  Requiring guess work in a game isn't really the most exciting game play mechanic, but it can be forgiven as Vernon's Legacy has a very interesting story to tell.  The scare factor isn't gained by having strange creatures jump out at you, (although I'm not saying something couldn't jump out at you)  but rather by creating an atmosphere that makes you think something will cause you harm.  The deeper you get in the manor the more nervous you feel with each successive door you unlock or key you find.\n\nThe controls and movements were silky smooth, and the controls were spot on, the only issue I had was occasionally the inventory would bug out, normally the RMB would put an item back in your inventory, but occasionally the item wouldn't be placed back in my inventory and I'd be forced to stop playing and reload the game.  That would clear up the issue, I never lost any progress and it conveniently placed me back in the main hallway.  Some of the puzzles were rather frustrating, such as trying to unlock the second safe door, for the life of me I couldn't find any pattern or message in game which gave me a description or hint as to which direction the tabs had to be placed, likewise with the hidden panel which required using the crowbar, it was randomly that I discovered the panel could be interacted with..\n\nOverall the game left me with a very positive feeling, and I felt it was a wonderful experience, not the scariest game ever made, but it certainly had me a bit creeped out at numerous times, like discovering that darkened room on the second floor, it was unnerving going inside and expecting some creepy creature to pounce into your face and end your adventure.  Lucky for me that never happened so I got to continue my journey through the possibly haunted house.\n\nPro's\nBeautiful graphics\nsmooth movements\nInteresting story told through notes\nChallenging puzzles\nA great atmosphere\n\nCon's\nBiggest con was the inventory glitch\nNext up was the puzzles solutions which were a little too well hidden, maybe a few additional notes with information helping to show the gamer where those hints are might be helpful.\n\n\nConclusion and recommendation\nVernon's Legacy was a well put together game, the story was interesting, the manor was beautifully put together and the game was fairly challenging to solve without resorting to seeking out a guide or walkthrough.  The only thing that would have been slightly great to add would be something to add tension prior to getting into the tunnels, maybe some noises, some floor creeks, possible even a few shadow figures which disappear as you approach them.  Even without these things the game is well worth a purchase and a play.  If you have a few hours to kill and want to play a game which tells a good story, I'd highly recommend Vernon's Legacy.","April 4","true","5.5"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","3"

In the first half an hour alone, you can find twenty long correspondences relaying the back plot, scrawled out in dainty long-winded chickenscratch. By the time you've left the relatively normal surroundings of the manor, you'll have read what feels like the equivalent of a novella. I'm certainly not going to complain about such great effort going into a game's lore but the pacing of it may instantly turn a lot of players away; there are instances where you read a long journal entry from the house cook, only to walk two feet and run into another full page from the maid, an issue compounded by the fact that very little actually happens in the beginning aside from poking through drawers and garbage to find keys or lock combinations.\n\nIt's a decent game so far but I'd urge caution for more traditional fans of the genre. It's far too lethargic to rustle up any sort of fear factor or tension at this point, leaving you with the equivalent of an old ghost story that has fallen out of relevance with today's more steely-nerved audience.\n\nMy wanderings below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGAZDjJohTI","March 31","true","1.2"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","23","29","4","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kagespartan/recommended/367010/","kagespartan","Lord Crocosquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kagespartan/","881 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor an Early Access game, this stands head and shoulders above a lot of others. It's not perfect, but that's what Early Access is for, right?\n\nWe pay for the right to Beta test and get some face time with the devs, and tell them what we think, and where they might go about doing things a little differently. Yes?\n\nExcellent.\n\nNow for the fun part. I wasn't sure what to make of this on the store page prior to release, as they had a few bits of war footage, a creepy-looking run-down/abandoned house, and such. Reminded me more of 7th Guest than Amnesia, if we're being honest. Then again, I saw more of Amnesia in videos than I did playing it.\n\nI spent a half-hour with this game, and what I saw was the look and feel of 7th Guest with the gameplay of Gone Home. I rated the latter hard in my review of it, primarily because it was simplistic, walky, and full of bits and bobs that didn't seem to have a lot to do with one another.\n\nNot so the first area of this game. The world is fully realized, and you can see the love and care that went into setting the  stage in a rather creepy mansion. The various bits of the environment are blended together nicely, and it almost feels like you're in post-WWI France (or maybe Germany, the exact location isn't particularly clear). The missing people here make it clear that soemthing went on, and that they left for what they considered a real reason-- not that they were out for a few hours away from their puzzle-trap.\n\nThe puzzles make sense in context, and what you're looking for in one area may be in another area that you still have access to. A very early puzzle requires that you find a couple of objects, and *then* you can work out the main puzzle in one room while the clues to solve it are in another entirely. They're not brain-breakers, but they're certainly enough to keep you exploring all the nooks and crannies while trying to solve them.\n\nThere are lots of bits of paper floating around, but mostly they're just background. They do help, but they're not strictly necessary. There will probably be an achievement for getting them all, but you don't *have* to have them if you feel like floundering around for awhile.\n\nIt's stagecraft. Very nice stagecraft if you're someone like me that adores story, but if you just want to power through, you can go without. I recommend getting as many as you can the first playthrough and trying for a speedrun after that.\n\nNow for the Bad Things, and I only really have two:\n\nFirst, turning the texture quality down will definitely impact your ability to play. That first puzzle I mentioned won't work if you're using low-quality textures. I tried that, and had to turn them up to see what I was doing. Once I returned them to the default (high), it was doable. If you don't have a more modern rig, you might want to give it a pass, or at least turn them up for a few minutes while you work through puzzles that require you read things.\n\nMy three-year-old laptop tolerated it, but it was kind of a near thing. Same of the shadows: at lower quality setting, they're a murky green color, but set to default, they work well.\n\nThere was a bug with an inventory puzzle at the end of my playthrough, and that was with a thing that didn't return to the inventory when commanded. Not sure what that was about.\n\nNow for the other thing, and this one was a problem (for me): The graphic settings allow you to change the quality of the experience, and well done, but there are no options to change the resolution. I tend to play games at 1600x900 Windowed so I can look at other things that might need addressing, whereas this game really loves to run Fullscreen. You can window it, but it retains that 1920x1080 frame size, and it cannot be adjusted. Your mileage may vary, but I found it rather irksome.\n\nAs stated at the top of the review, this is an Early Access title, and the Dev says they want to make sure they've got all the bugs out before they finish things. Sincerely, I hope they do. For all my griping in the last couple of paragraphs, it's a solid start to what looks to be a really interesting game. For the full price, it's not a bad deal. For the intro price of $5.99, it's very nearly a steal.\n\nWell done, Triple Brick. Well done.\n\nYou're welcome to contact me about any specifics, and I can show you the footage with the issues I had, and maybe a few ways you might resolve them.\n\nTL;DR: Fun little creep-out in an environment that makes sense and isn't overloaded with oppressive music loops. I'll wander back and append more to this as I get further through the game.\n\nEdit: Since there seems to be some dissent as to whether or not the game is any good, I present this video: Zaxtor99 and I did some commentary and a review for the game live, and here's the video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV-v9vl0eR0\n\nVernon's Legacy is after the Unconscious footage and shredding.","March 31","true","0.7"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","16","22","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/recommended/367010/","morphicmetal","morphicmetal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/","3532 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nVernon's Legacy is a first person horror based game where you move about collecting notes and other inventory items to progress further along.  It later changes and becomes more of a chase-style game, where you still must collect items, but the chases can make it more difficult, along with the way the map system is done for the second half.\n\nThe new game itself opens with some voice acting and a few lines about your uncle dying, and then you enter the manor located in what seems to be an area in post war-torn Germany.\nThe movement begins with the cliche "find the key" type of scenerio, and then you must do various things to move forward and progress inside the manor.\n\nLater on you realize you have gotten into more than you bargained for, as there is a bit of a twist, and things get a little more difficult and intense.\nThe element of having to run away and yet still collect various items adds some extra difficulty to things, but it's still not too overly hard.  You can keep anything you collect if you end up dying, but it definitely changes up compared to the beginning once you get beyond a certain point in the game, which I thought was a great thing.  Anyway, my full take on it so far:\n\n\nPros\nReally well done graphics.  I liked the impression I got from this right off the bat.\n\nThe theme was very well done too, and everything fit nicely for the setting.  The documents were sometimes interesting, and they were not overly long or too boring, for the most part.  They would generally relate directly to what was going on in the house once you were there.\n\nI thought it was fun gathering items to unlock other areas, or progress further onwards, kind of point and click style.  It was sort of a seek and find, with a few puzzle elements where you had to notice things around you through observation in order to break codes, or find hidden meanings behind things around you.\n\nThe later twist in gameplay was quite well done, I thought.  I enjoyed how thrilling and suspenseful it could be with the chase elements.\n\n\nCons\nI'm not really fond of the voice over narration at the very beginning.  I mean, it's not terrible, but it feels strange since it's only the very very beginning part, and nothing else has anything like this once you start to move around and play.\n\nI wish I could do a little bit more with my character, in a general sort of way.  Interact with things more, have more options for my character, or things like that.\n\nSome of the information in the letters was not important to me, or did not seem too relevant, but other letters were directly related to what was going on, explaining things a little further about the events unfolding at the manor.\n\nI would like this to be a good bit longer before it is finished!\n\n\nGlitches\nI can move through the first statue on the left side.\n\nThere is a picture on a table that I can see through in one of the first rooms if I look around the back side of it.\n\nIn the kitchen, there is a drawer that moves through a piece of table cloth.\n\nLots of other clipping issues (putting objects through walls and such).\n\n\nOther Thoughts\n***POTENTIAL SPOILERS! HOWEVER, WILL TAG AS SUCH!***\n\nWell, after playing through the game so far, I thought it was interesting.  Slow start, but the game turned from a point and click kind of first person information and object gathering run - to a literal run for your life, or die game style at moments!\n\nI wasn't really sure what to expect from the game at first, since it was so focused on finding this key or that item to repair or open this door or that other item.  After the first section was cleared though, it got very very interesting...\n\nOnce you get to the basement, the evil manifests in front of you, and will patrol areas.  You have to run if you are detected, and it can be hard to get away from these skull-like evil dark beings.\n\nIn some areas I was able to trap them between doors, since they are unable to open them, but other areas I had to just power search or run around in a big circle, kiting them until I got to their patrol areas so I could thoroughly search where they were initially camped out.\n\nI liked the suspenseful chases and the rush-like style of having to risk death, or move to escape the later stuff, in the second half, and all in all I like this early access game, and I would recommend this to anybody into the first person style horrors where you have to run for your life or die, to give this one a try!  It's pretty thrilling when you are noticed and have to run away!\n\nMaybe not enough yet for the full ask price, but to be fair, it's still in early access, and there will be more to come.  Very neat concept, and the overall impression I got was nice.  Well done graphics, and a nice vibe to it, overall.  Enjoyable from start to finish, out of what is available so far.  Give it a try if you enjoy this style!\n\n** Disclaimer:  I was given a key to review the game.

Visuals are nice, the puzzles are good, and fairly typical for a horror Adventure. While the first part in the house dosent bring too many scares, but once you get into the basement, you will find your self running for your life several times :) well worth it to check out, especially at this low price it is now.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/igvNiE42Vc4","March 30","true","2.5"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","17","26","3","0"

This game has a few puzzles and keys that help deliver everything you read in a particular order, but nothing is terribly difficult or should take you more then a few minutes to solve.\n\nWhere this game delivers is once some of the back story has been established and you come face to face with what haunts this home of your deceased uncle.  As you try and piece together the whole story, you'll need quick wits and calm nerves keep you from looking like a big scardey cat to anyone who might be watching you play the game in your home.\n\nIt's not complete at the time of its launch in early access, but the developer has made that well known and been up front that the rest of the story is coming in the months to come.  If you don't mind waiting to see the resolution of this game, then I highly recommend that all horror game fans not pass this one up.  For the price, it delivers and promises to deliver even more as is completed.  While there are a few random glitches and oddities in the game, the fact that it's in early access excuses these minor set-backs and I'm confident they will be ironed out before this game is released as a final product.\n\n7 out of 10 on early access launch day, much likely a higher score once it see's completely and delivers a full game and more value.\n\n","April 3","true","2.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

An intriguing game of survival horror. Will you be able to survive the experience?\n\nIntroduction\nThanks to games like Vernon's Legacy I love graphic adventures. This is an immersive story of someone who starts to investigate about the last days of his uncle and the people who surrounded him. You'll find a lot of letters that will give you a clue of what's going at the Dunkenhof manor who contains an intriguing secret in depth tunnels.\n\nGameplay\nAt first glance, this is an easy game to play. Point and click(ish) style but with a good context about the story of the main character and  a lot of exploration.\n\nYou'll have to investigate and search every room and read every letter. May contains clues very important to continue the game and understand what's going on there. Some of the puzzles are obvious others not, don't hesitate to move things if you think you can find something useful. If you played other graphic adventures the mechanics use to be the same.\n\nThe combination of music, ambiance sounds and graphics introduces you in an immersive situation in a creepy Dunkenhof manor. And when I say creepy I mean it. Turns creepier at the second level. You'll have to run, from what? Well play the game and you will know.\n\nI loved the details of the old photographs and the paintings of the belle epoque. They seem old even in that period of time where the game is placed. Also, the furniture and all the architecture are quite correct. The whole house is full of startling sounds. I really love those details, it really improves the experience of gaming and being part of a horror mystery.\n\nPros+ Lovely graphic quality\n+ Immersive experience thanks the music and ambiance sounds.\n+ The letters helps a lot to put a context to the game\n+ Good story\n+ Easy controls\n\nCons- Some of the puzzles are very obvious.\n- Too point and click(ish) sometimes\n- No checkpoints in harder levels (like the second one)\n\n\nFinal ThoughtsI really like this game. The second level could be frustrating, you have to run with a really creepy music. Maybe you can change the "Benny Hill" show music to have more fun. First time happen something was shocking then starts to be frustrating.\nBy the way, this is a really good game and I enjoyed it. I love graphic adventures and survival horror, this is a good game with a good price.\nThanks the developers for this game!\n\nRating:8/10","April 10","true","3.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","2"
