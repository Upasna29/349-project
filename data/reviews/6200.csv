I remember this one from my teen years as a hilarious strategy simulation with an innovative concept, especially for its day. I spent days with my retail copy of the game, trying to find ways of releasing those trapped ghosts so I can recruit them! Ghost Master was developed by Sick Puppies Studio in 2003 and enjoyed some critical acclaim due to its intriguing concept. Yet, the game failing on a commercial level, the company closed its doors and Ghost Master remained to be a one shot wonder. Now looking back and enjoying the gameplay yet again, I can positively say that the game lost little in its fun and aged quite nicely anyhow.\n\nWelcome, Ghost Master! You are an incorporeal entity: a commander of the spirits of long deceased, haunting this realm to drive those silly mortals out of their wits! ...and you got summoned by a bunch of teenagers via an Ouija board for kicks. Immediately, you get rid of those pesky mortals by summoning your servants and set HQ in the abandoned school in Gravenville. Your next task: scaring the heck out of all those mortals inhabiting your town, teaching them paranormal lessons for their various misdeeds and recruiting new members for your team while you are at it. Enjoy!\n\nOkay, this all sounds wonderful. You are a big, bad ghost master capable of controlling various ghosts and scaring people... But remember that mortals are not defenseless. You'll face witches, mediums, mad scientists and ghostbreakers - actually ghostbusters, but you know, copyright issues - and try to overcome many challenges in each new mission you are introduced with. Gravenville also comes with its own distinct setting, consisting of countless parodies centering paranormal horror stories like Blair Witch, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Phantom of the Opera etc. Characters have their own stories wrapped in situational comedy.\n\nTalking about gameplay dynamics, in each mission you are to choose a team of 4-8 ghosts in your repertoire and go on for the haunting. As you win missions, you are given gold plasm based on the success of your haunting, calculated according to how much of a havoc you've managed to wreck in the building: how many mortals scared, any of your haunters get banished, how many new recruits you've managed to save etc. At the end of the haunt, you can visit your HQ and use gold plasm to train your ghosts to unlock many new abilities, building up different strategies for different missions.\n\nThe game environment and graphics basically seem like The Sims 2 with a couple story buildings, AI people interacting with the environment and each other. Main difference is that you are the intruder. All your ghosts, depending on their types, need different fetters - items or places that they can be bound to, so their area of influence is limited. This is where the strategy part comes in. You collect plasm during the mission by scaring them and use collected plasm to activate their power levels, also arranging orders for when to use certain powers. Most levels come with puzzles to figure out and as you unlock new missions, things get harder and harder. All missions contain various other ghosts that you can newly recruit if you are to figure out how to free them from their mortal entrapments. They all will ask for certain obscure conditions in riddles to be met and figuring those conditions out is the half of your job. Once figured out, you are left with strategy and patience.\n\nWell, I think that would be all. The game isn't that long, but you are welcome to revisit old missions to gather gold plasm, unlocking new abilities and trying new strategies. The Steam and GOG versions of the game contain a new level at the end that wasn't presented in the original version and it is insanely hard. There is some talk that a fan-made Ghost Master 2 is in development at the moment, so fingers crossed!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","May 1","true","12.8"," 42 of 42 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","42","42","0","0"

In Ghost Master, you control an organisation of ghosts, spectres and horrors. Your objectives range from the simple and amusing frightening of mortals to gather energy from their fear to more complicated matters such as making sure the mortals find the bodies of murder victims to appease their spirits and many other tasks that are suitible for one controlling ghosts and spirits.\nMany levels have oppertunities to pick up new ghosts for your future missions, with their requests ranging from complicated tasks such as proving the corruption of one mortal to an other to the relatively simple tasks of freeing them from a fetter or bond placed upon them by breaking it in some way. The key aspect here is that you can not go and just smash or destroy the object yourself. You will need to use either your team's powers to control the circumstances such as the wind and rain or the mortals in a mission. Ghost Master will let you feel like you're playing a god...All while delegating these tasks to your ghosts and having goals set by someone or something higher up the chain of command. You organise an invisible force that tries to acomplish its goals through subtle manipulation of the mortals. Mortals who themselves might intervene in your plans - maybe they call in a medium to try to banish your ghosts, or perhaps they're just incredibly stubborn and refuse to believe in ghosts. Whatever the case, you can choose to do the absolute minimum needed, you can just scare off the mortals in as entertaining matters as you can...Or you can subtly manipulate them to do your bidding, get all the potential ghosts freed and play with those scared fools by checking on their individual fears and phobias to scare them as best as possible for as little energy as possible, or try to drive them insane(Though complete insanity is a thing that usually only works on those who are already unhinged, or with a LOT of time). Every one of them is different, with their own fears and a bio, their own jobs to do, their own behaviors their own relationships, and so on.\nMany of the levels include a puzzle-like request by a ghost, having you complete a task to set them free(At which point they join you for future missions). Usually this is a matter of resolving a last grievance they had while alive, or to do them a favour or break the item that holds them there. Some are easy, and others are incredibly hard.\n\nThe ghosts are controlled by placing them at a fetter, something that they identify with and can use to stay in the physical realm. Something that fits them that they can inhabit in the physical world. It could be an electrical appliance for a gremlin, or a fireplace for a fire elemental, or objects with an emotional charge to them, a place, or even a child. You control what powers they have access to by feeding them energy, which you extract automatically from the fear of mortals(And powers with a bigger effect tend to have a higher cost).\nMortals who do not believe in ghosts are harder to scare, so you need to boost their belief in the spirit world by odd events, such as rain indoors, unnatural cold, heat or luck, a sudden storm coming out of nowhere or several other things that don't quite fit or erode their mental barriers...Which coincidentally makes them easier to scare.\n\nBut then there aren't only good things. The story ends on a cliffhanger, and sometimes the favour needed to free a ghost can be annoyingly frustrating and appear based on random chance more than your own actions. The game's recommend haunting team does not always have the powers needed to complete these favours, and you do not know what you're going to find in a level until you check it out. There are no missions aside from the story ones, and in my personal opinion there weren't enough that were simple missions to scare away everyone, or a sandbox mode - Just for the fun of it all.\n\nWhatever the case, you'll spend hours enjoying building your team, toying with the mortals or just trying to do the missions, in the end it is well worth the price. If you're not entirely sure even then, it goes on sale quite often and you can pick it up for incredibly cheap almost every steam sale.","June 27, 2015","true","0.1"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","31","35","0","0"

Might be something like having the authorites come to a certain room to find out about a previous murder, or scare everyone out of the building.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goodguynickpt/recommended/6200/","goodguynickpt","Good Guy Nick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goodguynickpt/","418 products in account","In Ghost Master, you command an army of ghosts and are trusted with completing an array of different objectives.\nThe story takes place in Gravenville, a town where a lot of paranormal activity takes place, after a group of teenagers summons you – the Ghost Master.\nBefore entering a haunting, you must choose which ghosts you take with you. You can pick anyone you want, but sometimes, especially when you are trying a level for the first time, it is better to press “Recommended” which will pick the best available ghosts in your army for said level.\nOnce you’re in, there are 4 main features you must worry about: Haunters, Fetters, Plasm and Mortals.\nThere are 47 playable ghosts and you can choose where to place them and which powers they can use. You can’t directly control them, so you need to learn when and which powers you want each of them to use and which orders to give (Allow a ghost to go after someone on its own or even use a certain power when no one is around). You start off by commanding a small army of classic horror characters, like the jack-of-all-trades ghost Boo or the glowing poltergeist Whirlweird. You will also be able to rescue restless spirits throughout the game (every level has at least one of these), increasing your army’s size and versatility. These trapped ghosts need to be set free but that is easier said than done. During the first levels, most ghosts are fairly easy to recruit; maybe you’ll need to destroy the fetter they’re on or scare someone they hated when they were alive. Later, though, there are a couple of complex puzzles you need to solve that require a lot of planning – make a certain person use a fetter or carry something across the building to a certain location. These are hard to figure out but extremely satisfying when solved.\nThere are 6 kinds of ghosts in the game: Sprites, Disturbances, Elementals, Vapours, Frighteners and Horrors. Each type of ghost has a certain area of expertise. Sprites, for instance, consume little to no plasm (the game’s “resource”), which allows them to use most of their powers early on. They are usually bound to smaller fetters, usually electrical, and can make them malfunction and cause blackouts or power surges. Horrors and Frighteners, on the other hand, consume large amounts of plasm and can terrorize mortals like no one else can. They can possess humans and materialize into gruesome sights, making them useful to get rid of humans who are harder to scare.\nGhosts can also level up; the more you use a certain ghost in the field, the higher its training level. Higher levels mean you will be able to give said ghost a bigger number of ever more complex orders, making its powers more effective and allowing you to let it haunt on its own, while you focus on something else. There are 8 training levels for each ghost.\nFetters are where you can place your ghosts. You can’t just simply place them wherever you want, which makes planning ahead and ambushing something to consider. Certain ghosts can only be bound to mirrors, for example, making them very useful if used strategically, while others can be bound to sleeping mortals, children, water or even emotional objects.\nThere are 2 kinds of plasm. Normal and gold.\nRegular plasm is something you need to summon ghosts and to use their powers. The stronger the ghosts, the more plasm they need to be bound to a fetter and the harder it gets to manage used and available plasm. Plasm is not spent – rather, you allocate an amount of available plasm to a ghost. If you need a certain haunter to use a more powerful spell, you can just unsummon one of the other fettered ghosts so the used plasm doesn’t surpass the maximum amount of available resources or make it use a weaker power which does not use as much plasm. Scaring people is the only way of earning a bigger plasm threshold – that is quite simple and straight forward when you need to scare all the mortals away from a level; on the other hand, when you get to levels where you can’t scare any of them away or you have a more subtle objective that doesn’t involve scaring, it is a rather tense experience. It is all a matter of balance. Failing to do so will have you banned from the mortal realm and you’ll have to try again.\nGold Plasm can be used to buy new powers for your ghosts. You can usually choose different powers for ghosts in the same category, making a more versatile army. Gold Plasm is earned by completing levels and time trials.\nEach mortal has a Terror (Red), Belief (Blue) and Madness (Yellow) bar. Some powers cause belief; mortals with low belief are less affected by terror – so you’ll want to increase all sceptics’ belief before attacking them with your terror powers; this will generate more plasm – so you can power-up stronger powers or bind more haunters. You can also take over a human’s mind, making them go insane. People with phobias or older individuals are more susceptible to this. When a mortal’s willpower reaches its Terror or Madness cap, mortals will either flee or go crazy. Mad mortals provide great entertainment and can also help you – terrorizing the rest of their fellow humans with their insane actions.\nA big part of humans you use to your advantage is fear – conscious and subconscious. All mortals have them. There are some powers that allow you to uncover said fears. When you know what a certain person is afraid of, you’ll be able to use powers which are absurdly more effective than most others. If someone is afraid of blood, for instance, you can just attract the mortal to a bathroom and use a power that turns water into blood, or make it come out of the walls or even flood the whole room with it. Same goes for spiders, darkness, being trapped or even loud noises.\nFortunately, mortals are not defenseless. You will meet humans that can banish your ghosts from the mortal realm, thus, making them unusable until the end of the haunting. From witches that summon protective circles, to exorcists, you’ll have to battle with all of them to be successful.\nMortals’ AI isn’t all that great; they get stuck fairly often and they tend to do the opposite of what you want them to do. Pathfinding is also an issue when the action takes place in smaller areas.\nYou do feel like you are haunting a small town because some of the characters you meet during the first levels will show up later in different locations and they also have the same fears and personalities.\nLevels are extremely well designed and varied– Mortals have a lot of escape routes to temporarily run away from your ghosts and you will need to improvise new tactics and approaches because humans will react to pretty much everything you do.\nGraphics are colorful and the game doesn’t take itself too seriously – which is quite refreshing, in my opinion. It is quite rare for a game about being a ghost and scaring people to embrace such a tongue-in-cheek, comedic approach.\nGhost Master also features a soundtrack I consider perfect. It sets the right atmosphere from the very beginning and I still listen to it from time to time.\nThis game pays clear homage to classic horror tropes; you’ll get the ghost bride that was left at the altar and even the headless horseman who was killed during the civil war. As you can see, movie references are scattered all over the game and characters and levels are smartly named “after” classic movies –“Phantom of the Operating Room” or “Blair Wisp Project”.\nA game that I recommend to everyone. It may look a little bit dated and it may have flimsy AI, but Ghost Master is an inventive game that brings us new gameplay mechanics and is undeniably a game brought to us by people who love and care for their work. The attention to detail and the countless amount of movie references and replay value make it my favorite game of all time.\n\nFinal Score: 9 out of 10.","September 23, 2015","true","20.1"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","1"

By doing so, they will slowly become vulnerable to your scaring tactics and powers.

You can also train your ghosts so that they can learn new powers or enhance their scaring abilities. It's your choice of strategy whether how you want to scare the current residents. The main goal of the game is to scare out all the residents from the house.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who loves the classic scaring games genre.\n\nNOTE: If you want this game, you should buy it during a sale.

There are around 50 ghosts in total and each haunter has its own personality, strengths and weaknesses. The spooks that work for you fall under six categories: sprites, disturbances, elementals, vapours, frighteners, and horrors named after their characteristics and skills. Skills can range from "Rattle Chains" and "Fog" to "Ghostly Apparition" and "Paralyze". Some ghosts are more beneficial in certain situations than others depending on the mission. Each time you scare a mortal you will increase your plasm; the energy that's needed to frighten them to begin with (ghost skills cost plasm to use). Scare them too much and people will flee from the building before all your goals are met, which can make your job more difficult. Mortals also have their own levels of belief, terror, and madness rendering them at times irrational, afraid or even insane! That can affect gameplay for the ghosts assigned to haunt them.  Watch out for  priests, witches, mediums and ghostbreakers, these humans have the ability to banish your ghosts until the misson is over. Missions can be both fun & humorous, poking fun at movies and TV shows (Titles like eg. Ghostbreakers, Poultrygeist, and Phantom of the Operating Room). Once the goals for a level have been met, the game rates your progress. It factors in time, the impact on the mortals your ghosts haunted, and how many mortals fled. If you completed the mission fairly quickly, a multiplier is added to the final score. This score relates the amount of "Gold Plasm" given, which can now be used to add more skills to spook crew!\n****A very unique, funny and highly enjoyable game! Loved it and fully recommend it!

Because I think someone made Ghost Master just for you. As the titular master of ghosts, you take an assortment of spooks and specters into different homes and buildings with the intent of driving out the residents. Each ghost has specific things it can haunt, like electronics or damp things, and several powers that unlock as you scare more and more people. There are also ghosts you can recruit during missions by completing certain tasks, foes to overcome like police and ghostbuster-types, and high scores to shoot for in each level. There are some clever locales to haunt too, like sorority houses, mystery mansions, cabins in the woods, schools, and more.\n\nThe game plays like a cross between real-time strategy and puzzle. You can give your ghosts orders and have to manage your spooking power between them, but scaring off mortals and completing tasks is more a matter of getting the right ghost in the right place. It's a terribly charming little game that is unfortunately starting to show its age, and can be a bit frustrating if certain people or ghosts don't path the way you need them to. Since you have no direct control over movement, tasks that require specific placement can be a chore to complete. Minor gripes aside, this a is perfect lighthearted game for the season, and one that most likely anyone can enjoy.","September 15, 2015","true","2.8"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","14","19","3","4"

In this case, you'll control a group of ghosts, called "haunters", in an attempt to scare the hell out of mortals. It's a Strategy/Puzzle game, and some missions require you to complete different tasks from scaring. Most of these special tasks involve using mortals to interact with certain objects that your ghosts can't use (not correctly, at least). All the ghosts are unique as each one of them as their starting skills and base behaviour (altough many details are never addressed by the game, it's something you pick up with experience). All of them have their special fetter, or a place where you can "bind" them, or summon them in the livings' world. Fetters vary from free roaming to being linked to a peculiar condition, with varying rarity. Often, strict links mean powerful ghosts. Most of the ghosts will be locked at the beginning, and will need to be rescued during missions. Each one of them as its unique rescuing requirement.

You have an arsenal of ghosts available to you and you want to scare people in a Sims type environment. The game starts of great with a cheesy fmv, you get to scare people in different ways with different ghosts.\n\nUnfortunately, they took it a step too far for me. The third and fourth mission were very puzzly. You needed to use certain ghosts in certain situations or you wouldn't be able to progress.\n\nI completed the third mission a little bit aggrevated because you needed to guide people to certain locations which was a chore. The mission after that was straight up "use this ghost in this situation to trigger this event, then use another ghost to do this and that".\n\nI wish they just kept it to scaring people and didn't make you solve puzzles. There is depth in just scaring people since certain people are scared of certain things.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it if you're not into the puzzles. Still, it's quite an unique game and I might persevere to see if things change.\n\nEDIT: I made it to the final mission before I became too frustrated to continue. As expected, most of the later missions are puzzle based and can be quite frustrating without a guide (in some cases even with a guide). The final mission is completely bonkers, in a bad way. You're reliant on luck for a correct scenario to occur and you pretty much need a certain secret ghost to complete it.\n\nIf you do pick this up, I would recommend using a guide if you're feeling frustated.\n\nUnfortunately even with a guide I was able to get stuck in a mission because I didn't have the proper ghost power to proceed. My only options were to go replay a previous mission and unlock a secret ghost that had that ghost power or go buy it for one of my existing ghosts (which wasn't an option as I already spent my coin for powers on other ghosts). I ended up editing my game with a save game editor to get that power.\n\nThis game was an unique experience.

I'm sure that with ALL ghosts in the ghoul castle I will be able to scare the hell out of mortals more effectivelly.

You start out with a handful of ghosts to send a group of college girls screaming from their sorority house. Over time, you get to recruit spirits to tackle more challenging scenarios.\n\nMany of the characters and scenarios in this game are inspired by TV shows, movies, and comics. Recognizing these pop culture references may get you chuckling. I’ve spotted references to The Evil Dead, Casper, Ghostbusters, The Three Stooges, and many more. The whole concept of gathering ghosts to scare off mortals makes this game immensely fun, especially when plenty of humor is thrown in. It certainly helps that many of the scenarios are cleverly designed.\n\nDespite all the good things going for this game, some of the fun is sapped out of it when trying to figure out what powers should be activated to get mortals to do certain actions. For example, in one scenario, you need to send three mortals to a cabin to complete a ritual, but the mortals would first have to find a way to cross a raging river and a deep chasm. Since the solution to these and other problems isn’t always obvious, you may need to experiment with different powers before making headway.\n\nThis wouldn’t have been a problem if not for the fact that mortals move around the map randomly like characters in The Sims. Some will use the bathroom, take a drink of water, or converse with their friends at random moments. While it does seem natural to have mortals behaving in this manner, it doesn’t help if you have to wait a long time for a mortal to do a particular action, such as bringing a gift to a specific room. If you aren’t even sure that what you’re attempting will work as intended, then having to wait more than a minute becomes an exercise in frustration.\n\nEven with these problems, Ghost Master is highly entertaining. If scaring the bejesus out of little computer people sounds like fun (and believe me, it is), do yourself a favor and get yourself a copy now.\n\nFor a more in-depth review, see my blog page[standoutgames.blogspot.com].","January 15, 2014","true","80.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I really, really do.\nThe concepts are solid, the visuals are very good and the senarios are intriguing.  It makes you wonder what could have been if there had been more planning and polish.\n\nHowever, a few levels in it becomes a punishing experience because you are often at the mercy of the clumbsy AI pathfinding and baffling level design that more often than not makes things much more frustrating than they have to be.  Combine that with poorly explained goals that only get worse as you go along, and you get a game that just isn't worth playing to completion.","November 25, 2013","false","16.0"," 31 of 58 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","31","58","0","0"

The people are dumb, and you screw with them as they investigate their surroundings - which is supposed to resemble real life "walking around the house" behavior but is a bit more active. Speaking of active, you're not "a" ghost - you're about a half dozen at a time.

If you didn't play this as a child, which I didn't, and so don't remember the solution, you will spend a lot of time having no idea if what you're doing is working. Is fear not rising because this ghost isn't working, or because the humans are just hanging out in the doorway and technically aren't inside the range of the power he's using? Is this spirit not getting freed because the power i'm trying to use isn't the right one, or because the humans just haven't gotten around to reacting to it yet?

GHOST MASTER was one of those hidden gems that I have replayed god knows how many times and still has a lot of legs today.  It is joyous, funny, and occasionally frustrating -- but an amazing strategy title that is funny and well designed and at $5 or less you can't go wrong. . .","December 18, 2010","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I played it through a couple of times, and I loved it each time.  It was challenging, funny, and I loved the movie references -- Funnily, a name of one of the levels became a movie a few years later (I'll let you figure out which one).  Though it looks superficially Sims-like, its definately an RTS.\n\nI wanted to play this again recently and couldn't find the disk, so I'm glad this is available on Steam.  The clincher to purchase was when I read that the bonus scenario is available on the Steam version.  On the original retail version, the bonus scenario was not available for the US version.\n\nIf you want a twisted strategy game that will make you laugh, I would recommend this.","February 10, 2014","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics are not bad for that time and are still not unpleasant. It can take a while though to build up everyone's fear meters enough to scare them out of a house so you will be looking at the same graphics for a while and they will make you miss your shiny new graphics because they are actually pretty dull. But your ghosts have pretty neat effects. All the people speak gibberish like in a Sims game to give it the illusion that they have unlimited speach properties hence the illusion of being more realistic. I would rather have real spoken english.

This is fine on it's own, nothing exciting, but fine. However, for them to read it all three must be in the cellar. I managed to get two down there, from what I can only assume was a glitch in the programming, but the third one (a lady if it matters) would not, under any cirumstance, go down there. I sat there for almost two hours waiting for the dumb broad to walk down there but instead she looked at book then put it back, sat down in two different chairs, looked in the fridge, washed her hands then walked to the out-house and took a ♥♥♥♥, got up, walked back to the fridge, walk back to the outhouse and took another ♥♥♥♥, walked back in and sat down on a chair. This cycle went on for *TWO HOURS* I tried luring her over to the cellar, but as soon as the charm wore off she went and took a dump and went back to the same cycle as before. I eventually was forced into restarting the "Mission" because of the broken cycle, but choose not too. Suffice to say it's unlikely I'll ever play the game again.

And even if you do figure out the "puzzles" sometimes the game will just refuse to let you solve it by flat out not having a person go into the room you need them in to solve the "puzzle".\n\nThe first couple of stages are simple enough to be kind of fun, but as you get further in the game quickly turns into a horrendous, frustrating slog.\n\nReally a pity.","November 4, 2011","false","2.5"," 14 of 33 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","14","33","0","0"

The cinematics were low-res. I wasn’t really impressed by it but it is from 2003. I didn’t realise it was so old until after I played the game. Looks a lot like the Sims.\n\nThe gameplay is not too bad. I got the hang of it with a bit of fiddling around (after skipping the tutorial). Doesn’t really seem to be a way to lose from what I saw (but I only played the first level). The mortals sound like they are speaking german or something. The most impressive thing about the game was the way you input your name. There is a transition from a cutscene to an interactive circular ouija board; you spell your desired name out on the board.\n\nOn steam the full price is $5 and I’m not sure that it would be worth it.

I lost interest afterwards for that reason and because I couldnt enjoy the game in the resolution I was forced to play in, it's all blurry and disgusting.

Though its quite similar I much prefer the Sega game to this only because it was much more simple to control and you didn't have to worry about placing minions. One map in this game took me an hour to scare one person out of the house. I lost interest afterwards for that reason and because I couldnt enjoy the game in the resolution I was forced to play in, it's all blurry and disgusting. So be warned this game does not support a full screen 1900 resolution and the controls are iffy. Also, the people you try to haunt speak in a repetitive weird language which gets annoying fast.","August 18, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

It's that simple.\n\nYour objective is to usually spook humans out of a house, which you do using the ghosts at your disposal. Different ghosts are 'bound' to different point of focus, the "fetters". So taking several ghosts tagged Corpse into the fraternity level is unadvisable, because they won't have anywhere to be bound to the material world.\n\nThere's a good amount of custom choices, with increased unlockable powers for all the ghosts based on how much ectoplasm (scary juice!) you earn. The levels always give a recommended lineup, but if you know what you're doing you can pick your own ghosts - to great success, or miserable failure: knowing the level helps!\n\nTheir powers can be combined in sometimes unpredictable power combos. As in, this is not mentioned anywhere in the game! But in a sense it rewards experimenting. The music really brings out the goofy, let's-scare-the-pants-off-some-mortals atmosphere. The pickup in tempo once you REALLY get your ghosts going, combined with the screams of the terrified victims, is just hugely entertaining.\n\nSome of the levels with extra objectives require creative thinking, and some can be downright "how the ♥♥♥♥ do I do this" moments.  Nonetheless, the game is absolutely worth its low price tag, is very entertaining, and has good replayability if you liked it the first time around. I loved this game when I was younger and I still love it now.","July 10, 2014","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay requires you to take control of your very own ghouls and each stage provides different objectives that you must carry out in order to finish the level. The difficulty (and maybe the only drawback of the game) lies within freeing certain ghosts. Sometimes you'll find yourself lucky at it, sometimes you won't.

Every time I tried to start it up, it went to a white screen and crashed. I became extremely confused and felt at a loss of 5 dollars, although it's not the money, it's the principle of the matter. Why sell a game that simply will not work? To my surprise, I was not the only one who had ran into this problem. Upon various hours of searching, and attempts to get the game to work, the only option (and very last) was to contact steam support about the problem and recieve a refund. I had then felt discouraged to do so after reading multiple comments from people complaining that steam will not contact them nor deal with the matter.\nThere are no words to describe the disappointment I felt at the time but I did not yet feel defeated, I wanted to know why.\nthe next day later, after reading more about what others have experienced and what they had done to fix the problem, I finally found the answer. There was nothing that needed to be done to the game but search in the folders and start the game from in the "Ghost data" folder, then starting the game by clicking "ghost". You must also have an internet connection and have steam open before starting the game. All along the problem was the game wasn't going to load unless it had a CD to run from. In order to play the game, you must manually dig thorugh your folder. This complaint is not towards the game as it works perfectly fine and is very entertaining and I do reccoment it. I am dissatisfied with steam for selling a game that is not in proper working order and for never dealing with the constant requests for help.","September 4, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I picked it up during a Halloween sale and I'm glad I did.  As another reviewer mentioned, it does remind me of a cross between the sims and evil genius. The first few levels are easy enought trying to scare out the inhabitants to complete the level, but it then becomes complicated with certain criteria you must accomplish during the mission. There are a couple of stages that I had to look up a strategy guide for because what to do wasn't obvious ( a lot of trial and error!).  I also recommend a strategy guide to pick up hidden characters that you would miss if you don't complete certain actions.  I give this game an 8/10 because it was more enjoyable, has more depth and challenge, and comedy than what it appears to have. There is also a stage that is a nod to Evil Dead, how can you not like that? I would love to have seen a part two.","March 16, 2014","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes you need VERY SPECIFIC ghosts to perform tasks, other times your creativity is the limit.\nYou will need to "upgrade" your ghosts with plasm to be able to maximize their performance in game and multitask.\n\nThis is just one of those game for its price you should give a crack at in terms of time, especially for $5.00.\n\nIt is likely that even after you complete the ENTIRE game (it is fairly lengthy), you will probably go back again and see if you can do a better job a second time.\n\nIf you do not mind a challenge, and have a good solid strategy head on your shoulder you should have no problems.\nYou will get a good laugh at the same time and its worth the entertainment.","June 8, 2015","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ghost Master is a game which is quite one of a kind. You play as a 'Ghost Master' who is the leader of a gang of ghosts who's task it is to scare the people of Gravenville.\n\nEach level is a parody of a well known horror movie. For example, there's a level called Poultrygeist. The level is set in a house which was built where a slaughterhouse for turkeys once stood. The goal is to free a poltergeist, who looks like a ball of light with feathers foating around it. Other settings range from sorority houses to hospitals to a military base.\n\nEach level has its own goal. Most of the time, that goal is to scare all humans untill they flee the location, or to drive them insane. In more complex levels, you need to manipulate the humans into doing certain tasks for you. Some humans (priests, wiccans,...) will fight back and try to banish your ghosts. You will find trapped ghosts in each level, who are stuck to an object. If you manage to free the ghost by doing a certain task/solving a certain puzzle, they will join your team. Each ghost has its own skills, and you can teach it new abilities following a skill tree. You can revisit each level and try a new team of ghosts and see if you can get a higher score with them. This adds a lot of replayability.\n\nThe best part of this game is in my opinion the sound design. When starting a level, all you hear is some sort of astral choir, singing in the distance. As your ghosts start interfering with the world, the music reacts to their actions. This builds up untill all hell breaks loose, and then, well, you should hear it for yourself. The music is awesome.","February 15, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since it is more than 10 years old, the visual side is outdated, but since the game has a sort of twisted, mischievous and ridiculous feel, the simplistic characters and environments never bothered me. Other than this possible downside, this game is amazing. Too bad we never saw a sequel.\n\nGhost Master is great fun.You are a spiritual entity who commands ghost. Your main resouce is ectoplasm, with which you pay for your ghosts' abilities. There are many different ghosts at your disposal since in each level, there is a ghost or ghosts you can free by fulfilling their wishes. Their abilities also vary; while some focus mainly on scaring mortals (Clatterclaws being one of the best and cheapest you can get), others have more specific abilities, such as creating artificial bond (a gift) or attracting mortals to their location. Your objectives also vary: sometimes you have to scare away everyone at the current location, sometimes you have to uncover a mystery or free a particular ghost.\n\nEven though the game is highly enjoyable, there's one thing that really got on my nerves. MORTALS. Some of them are stupid beyond belief. Imagine you have to uncover a dead body in order to free the ghost that once resided in it. You use that ghost's ability to attract a mortal to see it. He walks right next to it, shrugs his shoulders and leaves the room. Sometimes it seems like they would rather be killed than help you to fulfill your objective. Oh, the frustration.\n\nSo, long story short...ghosts, scaring mortals, funny references (Hardboiled) and various objectives, classic game...and cheap. You shouldn't miss this one.","March 26, 2014","true","32.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's that simple.\n\nYour objective is to usually spook humans out of a house, which you do using the ghosts at your disposal. Different ghosts are 'bound' to different point of focus, the "fetters". So taking several ghosts tagged Corpse into the fraternity level is unadvisable, because they won't have anywhere to be bound to the material world.\n\nThere's a good amount of custom choices, with increased unlockable powers for all the ghosts based on how much ectoplasm (scary juice!) you earn. The levels always give a recommended lineup, but if you know what you're doing you can pick your own ghosts - to great success, or miserable failure: knowing the level helps!\n\nTheir powers can be combined in sometimes unpredictable power combos. As in, this is not mentioned anywhere in the game! But in a sense it rewards experimenting. The music really brings out the goofy, let's-scare-the-pants-off-some-mortals atmosphere. The pickup in tempo once you REALLY get your ghosts going, combined with the screams of the terrified victims, is just hugely entertaining.\n\nSome of the levels with extra objectives require creative thinking, and some can be downright "how the ♥♥♥♥ do I do this" moments.  Nonetheless, the game is absolutely worth its low price tag, is very entertaining, and has good replayability if you liked it the first time around. I loved this game when I was younger and I still love it now.","July 10, 2014","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I picked it up during a Halloween sale and I'm glad I did.  As another reviewer mentioned, it does remind me of a cross between the sims and evil genius. The first few levels are easy enought trying to scare out the inhabitants to complete the level, but it then becomes complicated with certain criteria you must accomplish during the mission. There are a couple of stages that I had to look up a strategy guide for because what to do wasn't obvious ( a lot of trial and error!).  I also recommend a strategy guide to pick up hidden characters that you would miss if you don't complete certain actions.  I give this game an 8/10 because it was more enjoyable, has more depth and challenge, and comedy than what it appears to have. There is also a stage that is a nod to Evil Dead, how can you not like that? I would love to have seen a part two.","March 16, 2014","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Players assume the role of a Ghost Master who, as you probably guessed, controlls ghosts.  The game is set up very similar to The Sims as far as look and feel go.  Your job as a Ghost Master is to perform various tasks, most involving scaring the crap out of people, and gaining new paranormal allies as you progress.  The game can be challenging learning the best way to scare guests and free fettered spirits, and with the ability to replay any level to get more rewards (Gold Plasm: used to teach your ghosts new tricks), there is a lot of gameplay time to be had.

Sometimes you need VERY SPECIFIC ghosts to perform tasks, other times your creativity is the limit.\nYou will need to "upgrade" your ghosts with plasm to be able to maximize their performance in game and multitask.\n\nThis is just one of those game for its price you should give a crack at in terms of time, especially for $5.00.\n\nIt is likely that even after you complete the ENTIRE game (it is fairly lengthy), you will probably go back again and see if you can do a better job a second time.\n\nIf you do not mind a challenge, and have a good solid strategy head on your shoulder you should have no problems.\nYou will get a good laugh at the same time and its worth the entertainment.","June 8, 2015","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is by no means "great" in all respects, but it is good enough to be enjoyed, and some parts really do stand out. There are a lot of different classes of ghosts and a lot of powers with different animations, sounds, humans' reactions. Each level has a decent story behind it, and the ghosts and narrator dialoges are nicely written and voiced in a tongue-in-cheek style.\n\nIt's a cute original game with much much more value than you'll typically get from $5 titles.","February 18","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not flawless but offers a great amount of entertainment for many hours to play. Almost all levels can be completed with a variety of different methods, and new ghosts to be unlocked in every level. You can replay the levels you have already completed, to unlock stuff that you may have previously left behind. Level designs have a lot of variety and many possibilities to complete them. It's quite laid back game with no sweating or heavy fustration. but double the fun. Not a new piece but still as great as back in the days it was released. Only real cons I've discovered worth mentioning is the unknown elements in the levels. Sometimes there is unlockables in places that you don't even notice, and methods progressing that you couldn't even think of for they are somewhat random.","January 27","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You cannot go back and use it in a previous mission. This can be by-passed with a mod\n- Majority of the time will be spent trying to free the ghosts\n- Very easy\n\nOverall, fantastic game and definitely worth the price.
