You are a farmer with a shotgun in your hand and must protect your barn from incoming waves of zombi cows. In each wave another type of obscure zombi creature joins the hordes. There are a bunch of cliches dealing of a typical redneck life and leading towards the grand finale: Fight against a Nazi UFO.\n\nThe gameplay is quite challing, yes, but it turns out in higher levels even more repetitive and boring. Although there is a mass of funny elements to discover, nothing remains as necessary remindable. Like a chopper support, nukes or a barn sentry. Wow how interesting.\nThe biggest lack are the uncomfortable controls like reloading each shell for one key hit or to aim precisely in the isometric playfield. Also some bugs are still included in this game.\n\nSo I can just recommend it to players of brute and unstrategical shooters.","November 3, 2014","true","9.4"," 54 of 75 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","54","75","5","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantom2450/recommended/297020/","phantom2450","phantom2450","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantom2450/","564 products in account","The Culling of the Cows is an absurdist gag game that, while it may provide you with all the rampant bovine slaughter you could ever dream of, is as of now not at all worth the price paid for it.\n\nAs a lone farmer stranded in rural 'Murica, you must overcome the armies of mutant cows, deranged hippies and obese gothic women that a Nazi UFO sends your way. By reading the previous sentence, it should be quite clear that this game is not taking itself too seriously. However, there is a clear difference between random humor with a purpose and random just for random's sake; this game strictly falls into the latter. Culling is basing its appeal entirely on the fact that the player gets to shoot cows...a lot. All of the other plot points mentioned in the beginning of this paragraph receive no explanation besides a single introduction screen per plot point, and are otherwise meant to serve as comedic masks for generic enemy types.\n\nThe game's fundamentals are disappointingly lacking. Gameplay is divided into levels that contain encounters in either standard "Waves" format, a variation of Waves that is only one large wave, or a last-stand turret mode called "Onslaught". The majority of the game's levels occur in the Waves format, with varying numbers and types of enemies and waves for each level. This variety does little to put off the repetition that sets in after a few rounds of slaughtering the same few animals and zombies over and over. The Waves format does allow for some character customization in weapon upgrades, but after a certain amount of experimentation I discovered an order of upgrades that, with moderate skill, could win all the levels. Some incentive in the level design to switch up gameplay styles would have gone a long way. The other gameplay mode, Onslaught, produces some of the most frustrating levels in the game due to sketchy hit detection, though it often provides a refreshing and enjoyable break from the Waves levels as well.\n\nVarious other parts of the game fail to stand out. The soundtrack isn't memorable and the art style has this feel to it that so many indie games seem to have, which at worst could be descibed as "one step above MS Paint". Largely, the game isn't bad-looking; it just has a habit of piling hundreds of multicolored cow corpses on the screen at once, which grates on the senses and leaves a lasting impact after seeing it over and over. Some parts of the game seem to be implemented strangely: controller support, despite being labelled as both "partial" and "full", relegates movement solely to the D-Pad, which is an odd choice. Culling's achievements are also strange: there are only five, four can be attained by the third level (two are bugged to only work with the keyboard) and the fifth is for beating the game. More achievements could help boost replayability, a facet which is important in this game considering it can be finished in just over three hours. Though most levels contain medals to earn for winning under certain conditions, the game doesn't offer rewards for earning the medals, which makes them largely meaningless. Perhaps tying some customization unlocks to medals would solve this issue?\n\nThough this game faces significant issues, I must give praise to the spirit of the developers. They've implemented some features like an internal cheat console, the achievements and trading cards by popular demand. Additionally, their desire to not make this game be simply a joke shows throughout the game. The farmer's voiceover has some genuinely unique and funny lines interspersed throughout the game, which work because the lines are not beaten to death in every level. As long as the developers stand by the good-hearted cow hate that is the root of this game, there's hope that this could turn into an indie cult classic in the future.\n\nThis game has set off on a mission: to spread the need to shoot cows whenever, wherever. It tries to achieve its goals through a game that has significant flaws. Should the developers focus on the problems that plague the core elements of the game, then this title will definitely deserve a second look. As of now, however, there is no way anyone would feel satisfied paying full price for this game. Save up for a sale, perhaps gift this to a friend in jest. Just...beware the cows. The Culling of the Cows gets a D.","December 26, 2014","false","3.2"," 53 of 78 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","53","78","7","1"

I had a lot of fun with it and would give it a thumbs up, if for nothing else then it is good for a laugh when you get gored by a zombie cow.","May 28, 2015","true","4.0"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","19","31","2","0"

There are 2 "gamemodes" you either control a guy running up-down and left-right while shooting, upgrading your weapon, or bring in assist abilities, or its a simple turret shooter. Number of maps: 1. Yes, only 1 map for a zombie defense game. The only difference between the levels are the assist abilities which. There are around 10 types of enemies, most of them basicly the same: cow, a bit faster cow, a bit tougher cow, ect. Controls are clunky. In the main gamemode you can't aim, you have to move your character in the line where you want to shoot. The hitbox are buggy as hell, bullets often go through the target without damaging them. Finishing the game takes around 2 hours, highly repetitive and there is no co-op. The game also highly overpriced (there are much better flash games in this genre for free). If you'd like to buy a zombie defense game which is cheaper, simple but has co-op and runs on a microwave go with the Yet Another Zombie Defense. It's only 2€ and essentially has the same, but cheaper and has coop (also frequently updated).\n\nTL;DR:\nJust don't buy this.\nIt's boring, has zero content, repetitive.","January 20","false","4.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/297020/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","The Culling of the Cows stands between Plants Versus Zombies (Or old farmer vs zombie cows -- and possibly nazi aliens) and a sidescrolling shooter.\nThis is made by Decaying Logic, the same developers that brought us Radical Roach, which I reviewed a while ago (and was not impressed at all).\n\nWhile I believe this is definitely an improvement over Radical Roach, many of the same flaws and design choices are present in this game, just to a lesser extent.\n\n\nAs usual, I'll start with presentation.\nNot unlike their previous game, the Artstyle is probably one of the defining points. While it feels like flash, the animations are pretty good, although a bit too limited (there is only one animation for each enemy, it seems, as well as the carcass sprite, which makes the field end up looking a bit too monotonous).\nThe interface templates don't really seem to fit the theme, but it's not too bad. Other visuals effects are also subpar, against the cartoony style they were mostly going for.\nThere are a few different areas that slightly change the look of the map, but don't be fooled, as the map doesn't change at all, except for the visuals.\nOne problem I've had with it, is that the dead bodies cover up the screen by the end of the levels, to the point that you can't see new enemies arrive very clearly. That should definitely be changed. Other than that, it's fine.\n\nThe Music is also very similar to Radical Roach. It's not awful, and it has some good moments, but it's very repetitive, and doesn't loop very well, which is unfortunate. It's upbeat, and a mixture between some rock/metal and electronic music which goes for the more arcade vibe than atmosphere. There are some old sci-fi melodies though, which is a nice addition.\nOne improvement that I want to stress is that the music no longer restarts whenever you fail a level! It's a weird aspect to consider, but I think it's very important. It didn't happen in RR, and it was really annoying to listen the song start over and over again. Now, it doesn't happen, and it's a subtle but important improvement, in my opinion!\n\n\n\nSo, let's talk about the Mechanics.\nAs I said, it's has a bit of PvZ in it. Essentially, you have a large lane to defend agains the zombies. There are no specific lanes as in PvZ, you can freely walk around, and so can the enemies. You have a shotgun, different ammo types, upgrades, and assists. You'll also, periodically, be able to call for a crate with a random power-up.\nYour job is to stop zombies from entering the barn, and also avoid being killed by them (if they hit you). Pretty straightforward.\n\nYou have a world map with the levels spread around (unlocking more as you go) with a couple of spreading paths, somewhat like One Finger Death Punch, only much smaller. These levels include a few different modes. There's Waves, in which, well, you fight waves of enemies, and there's a limit number of zombies that can enter the barn; Kill 'Em All, in which there's only one long wave and you can't let any zombie pass; Onslaught, in which\nsome zombies can go through, but you have a machine gun (or a bazooka in one level) and shoot from the top of the barn, not worrying about dodging. And then, there's a couple of Boss levels.\nThe first two play essentially the same, with the exception that you can a few seconds to "rest" between waves. It had very, very little to the overall experience, but hey.\n\nThere's a significant number of different enemies, although a bunch of them are just faster or healthier versions of the previous. Still, it keeps the game interesting when starting out, since you need to change up your play a bit. Later on, new enemies stop coming, and every level becomes waay too similar (which is a feat in a 3 hour game).\nThere are also 3 badges to unlock in most levels -- these make the game harder, but they're barely there to reward you. There are some not to let any zombies pass, or not to miss any shot, but the others are simply about not upgrading your weapon, not using assists, etc. These do NOT make the game more fun at all. On the contrary, you're just shooting yourselves on the foot by limiting variety. It would certainly add challenge, but it's not very interesting challenge, in my opinion. But they're all optional, so it's fine. If you're into that, it exists. Overall, I'd say rethink your design on that.\n\nWeapon upgrades are only on a level to level basis, and not persistent. You can increase the number of bullets, the number of bullets you reload at a time, add a laser to increase accuracy, or do something else that I'm not entirely sure of. I assumed it's reload speed.\nRegarding ammo, you have Spread Shot, Explosive Shot, and Penetrating Shot. These do not stack, much to my disappointment. It could be really fun to have Spread Explosive Shots and just explode everything! But no... there are no synergies. If you purchase both, they'll alternate between them, from what I could tell.\nAssists go from a chainsaw in the barn entrance to an AirStrike, or an Auto Machine Gun, for a few seconds. There are more to these, and they have a cooldown associated. I didn't use any of them, most of the time, because they weren't needed, nor particularly fun to use. You just press the button, and have the game made easier... But it's good that it's there, there's certainly room for different playstyles! Maybe you'd prefer not to upgrade your weapon as much, and focus on "traps", that's totally fine!\n\nAmmo and Upgrades in-game cost money. And here's the big issue I have with it: You start each level with a certain amount. Then, by calling the random power-up, there's a chance you'll get a bit more, but it's generally not significant. So, you'll mostly upgrade your weapon at the start of the level, and then play with that. It's not dynamic at all, as every level played out pretty much the same to me. Sure, I could have forced myself to use different "loadouts", but the one I had worked for me, and the enemies didn't really require different tactics to be beaten. It would have been better to gain money over time, having waves get progressively more difficult, scaling with the upgrades you were able to buy!\nPacing is pretty much unexistant, unfortunately.\n\nWell, maybe I'm being a bit too negative. The fact of the matter is that the game didn't do anything interesting to me. However, it was still somewhat fun for a bit. The kind of mindless fun you need to just pass time. You'll fight dozens of enemies per level, making each field become just a bunch of bloody cows on the ground. It's dumb, but it's somewhat enjoyable. Just not very interesting... Take One Finger Death Punch, for instance. That game is totally mindless fun! But it's far more interesting. First, it's very rhythmical, and you need to be in the "zone" to identify which enemies require which clicks to perfectly complete a level. And there are many different weapon that actually *feel* different, and make you look like a badass, cutting everyone up. I realize that these are two different games, but they both go for a similar feeling, that's why I'm bringing it up.\n\nOne aspect I enjoyed quite a lot was the last Boss. That was a pretty fun fight. Even though it had no upgrades or anything, the 3 phases complemented each other pretty well, and while challenging, it didn't feel frustrating to me. It should have had a few more boss fights, would definitely make the game more interesting.\n\nThat's enough rambling. For the price, I can't recommend it at all. But if this seems appealing to you, give it a shot if the price drops. While I've beaten it in 3 hours, you can get a bit more out of it, if you go for the badges. And the developers seem to update the game from time to time, so it may get better.\nOverall, not awful, but not particularly good either.","November 16, 2014","false","2.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I saw an advert for a free copy of "Culling of the Cows," so I figured I would give it a try. And I am very glad that I did.\n\nPart 1:  Storyline and Gameplay In COTC, you are a farmer who encounters everything from zombie cows to Nazi UFOs on his farm. It is your job to shoot the oncoming cattle and other enemies before they can enter your barn. There is a plethora of upgrades for your weapons, barn, and even "God Abilities." It could be considered a sidescroller (but with no scrolling), but this game will appeal to both arcade gamers and retro shoot-em-up gamers alike.\n\nAs for the length of the game, COTC has an adequate number of "missions" which provide for plenty of hours of fun gameplay. And if you ever, for some odd reason, get bored of destroying zombie cows with a barn-mounted machine gun, there are cheat codes to get you to the final mission and other such objectives.\n\nPart 2: Graphics?  There isn't too much to say about the graphics here. The game could have done well as a pixel graphic game, but I believe that the developers made the right decision sticking with non-pixelated cows. You get an arcade feel from the graphics while still being able to make out sharp lines and appropriate detail.\n\nPart 3: Is it fun?  Of course it's fun! This game is unlike any other arcade-zombie-tower defense game you've played before! Imagine Farming Simulator, but instead of growing crops, you shoot cows, and instead of upgrading your equipment, you upgrade your explosive-bullet extended mag infinite ammo no reload shotgun! This is a game that you can definitely lose track of time while playing and get caught up in the hilarity and epicness of the goals.\n\nValue As I said before, I got this game as part of a special promotion, however, I would gladly have bought this game. It's well worth the money (At time of writing: $1.94, 85% off)! Let's put it this way - you can get a pack of gum or two which might last just a few days, or you can get COTC and have dozens of fun hours of gameplay! The only thing is that I feel like $12.99 is a little bit much to ask for regular price, I would wait for it to go on sale. Definitely a game that you can casually pick up right where you left off, even if it's been a week or two. Would recommend.\n\nAspect        Rating                Gameplay        9                Graphics        8                Enjoyability        10                Value        7\nFinal Points on the Game This game is a definite buy, whether it's 2 bucks or 10. You'll have a great time playing it, and best of all, it has zombies with  no early access ! What's not to love about that!\n\nBe sure to check out any of my other reviews on my profile, and please upvote if this helped you, I hope it did!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantadidi/recommended/297020/","fantadidi","Fantasy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantadidi/","3018 products in account","The Culling Of The Cows is a side-scrolling shooter. You are Sammy, a farmer, and you have to defend your properties with your shotgun against waves and waves of cows, zombies and undead cows.\n\nThere are lots of levels in this game. The classic type of level involves defending your farm against successive waves of ennemies. You will also play some levels where there is only one wave, but a big one ! Not to forget the last kind of level, which is a level where you are in your farmhouse, shooting ennemies from the window with infinite ammos !\n\nFor the first two types of levels, you can :\n- Upgrade your ammos. 4 different types of ammos are available : the normal ones, the "spreading" ones, the "piercing" ones and the "explosives" one. You just have to buy the type of ammos, then you have access to an infinite amount of them.\n- Upgrade your weapon. The first option is to increase the amount of ammos you have in your shotgun. The second one is to increase the number of bullets you put in your weapon each time you reload it (the most useful to my mind). The third one allows you to decrease the delay between each of your shot. The last one gives you an horizontal red line to make it easier to aim.\n- Use Assists. These are special powers that will greatly help you. You can have access up to 4 of them, depending on the level. They can be used freely, you will just have to wait a little bit between each use. For instance, you can spawn an helicopter that will destroy ennemies with a machine-gun, or ignite a fire that will burn any ennemies that will walk (or at least try) through it.\n- Use Supplies. Just using a specific key, you can spawn supplies which will grant you money or a bonus for a short period of time (invicibility, infinite ammos, speed increase, time slowed down, ...).\n\nFor each of these levels, you can get 3 "medals" (it looks like achievements for each level, but they are only in-game, not Steam). To unlock that, you will have to complete a level without upgrading your ammos, upgrading your weapon, using Assists ... You do not need to unlock all three of them at the same time, you can focus on a specific one and complete the level again focusing on an other one.\n\nRegarding the ennemies, you will encounter different kinds of them : standard cow, charging cow, very big cow, explosive cow, standard zombie, pretty-hard-to-kill zombie, etc ... Also, beware the crows falling from the sky, they are indicated with a blue beam, so that you have time to avoid them ! And, of course, there is a final stage with a final boss, which is not that difficult to defeat.\n\nIn the end, The Culling Of The Cows is a fine game, I had a lot of fun playing it even though it is kind of repetitive after the first levels and the gameplay is mainly based on "when to reload your weapon". It took me ~5-6 hours to get all of the medals and defeat the final boss. This will unlock all of the Steam achievements. The soundtrack fits well with the game and the graphics are fine. I played with a gamepad, I think it is much more enjoyable than using a keyboard.\nMore content would be great because, once you have killed the final boss + got all of the medals, there is nothing more you can do. And, for more than 10€, it seems expensive to have only a 6 hours-game. I would recommend to buy this game during sales or try to get it in a bundle, but do not spend the full amount for it :-)","December 26, 2014","true","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The game is essentially a defence title, with an assortment of monsters rushing into the barn, and as the farmer it is your job to prevent the said monstrosities from getting in. If you fail a certain number of times, the stage is over and you have to restart again.\n\nTo mix up the formula some monsters act a little different to one another, along with varying amounts of hit points. To aid the chaotic game play, players can also summon a few tactical skills on the field, along with some limited and temporary upgrades to the shotgun.\n\nRepeat the same formula with increasing difficulties for dozens of stages and you get the general idea of how this goes. Every rarely you’ll get to fight a boss or two, but they’re way too simple to pose a challenge.\n\nThe art style is hand drawn and mostly consistent, like the game play that may not strike everyone’s fancy either, but it sat well enough for me. The biggest problem I had with the game was that it lacked a sense of progression, you’ll upgrade your weapon level after level, but they never stick. There is also little point to divert from the main path and complete every stage, since there is nothing to unlock or to accomplish.\n\nFor the low price though, I would recommend it for a decent distraction.","March 6","true","7.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You play as a farmer defending his barn from ever increasing waves of zombies and zombie cows. There is a large variety of what enemies you face as well as various weapons and defense assists that keep the gameplay feeling fresh.\n\nOne positive addition to the game is the special achievements, which adds to the ways you can enjoy the game.  The interface is simplistic, as is the gameplay. That being said, it is high paced with a feeling of momentum, and a great threat level. If you find it too easy, there are achievements that add a new layer. It can be repetitive, and I would have liked to see a lot more maps.  The weight of your weapon has impact, and it's satisfying to see your enemies explode.\n\nThis game is enjoyable, but has a feeling of 'the same'.  It is a casual game, but it does what it needs to do very well.  I never felt like my time was wasted, or that I wasn't being respected by the game.

This is just like one of those browser games that you can find on Newgrounds or Kongregate that you can play for an hour or two at a time. Give it a try if you like that sort of thing, it’s a small download size.\n\nYou play an old dude with a shotgun defending your farm against (zombie?) cows charging at you on a small 3D field.  You can move up down and side to side but the screen doesn’t scroll. The zombie cows of various speeds and toughness will run from right to left toward you and you need to blast them before they get into the barn you’re guarding on the left side of the screen. To help you on your task, you can purchase gun upgrades and different types of ammo (buckshot, exploding, etc.) in each level, or use “assists” such as sentry guns or firewalls that are free but on cooldown timers.\n\nPros:\n+Simple gameplay that can occupy you maybe 30 minutes at a time when you have nothing better to do. Each level is maybe 5-10 minutes long and not too hard once you get the hang of it.\n+There are some humor elements to the game so even though each level is mostly the same, you can get a couple laughs.\n\nCons:\n-There are maybe 50 levels of the same gameplay and you may get bored pretty quick.\n\nOverall the game is fun for a short time and if you’re like me, you’ll probably be done with it after getting the easy Steam achievements. Play it and forget it.\n","December 30, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Armed only with a shotgun, you must defend your barn from these zombies.\n\nEven though you have a single weapon through most of the game (the aforementioned shotgun), there's two extra weapons that appear in specific levels: a machine gun, and a rocket launcher. Even then, the shotgun can use four different types of ammo, and there's several upgrades for it, that make it even better at killing stuff. You can also get supply drops (like extra cash for upgrading your weapon, invincibility, etc), and use different abilities to kill the zombies, like providing your barn with a machine gun, or a saw, sending a nuke, etc.\n\nEven though the idea of shooting cows might sound dull at first, there's a good variety of enemies: different types of cows (even cows strapped with TNT, helpful for blowing up nearby cows!), and, as already mentioned, a few human enemies. There's also crows falling from the sky.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, all the levels consist of you defending your barn against waves of enemies (or against a single, large wave), with a few changes: in most of the levels, you're in front of your barn, and the cows can kill you, while in a few "Onslaught" levels, you shoot the cows from the safety of your barn's second floor.\n\nNice game, once you get the hang of it. I recommend it.","December 10, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A minor annoyance, but a very simple thing that should have been in the game.\n- Tutorial failed to inform me that I could shoot backwards, and skips forward to the next tip if you accidentally press A rather than showing the hint text first, even if you've never run the game before.\nGot insta-killed three times trying to do the first level because I was attempting to move back far enough to protect the barn from cows that managed to run past me, and found out accidentally when trying to select a different action bar option.\n- Spelling error on the text for the very first level after the tutorial. "Surly" this could have been fixed before release, or in any of the 3 updates during the year and a half since it appeared on Steam.\n\nThis could have been a good game, and there's potential there... but a little bit of quality control goes a long way, and is something this game is lacking.","November 5, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'd say this is a game worth playing.\n\nMany things were enjoyable such as the following:\n\nPositives:\n♦ Almost Each level is unique\n♦ Every level you beat unlocks new enemies\n♦ Every level you beat unlocks new support items\n♦ Unique way to upgrade weapons\n♦ Breaks between waves\n♦ Random Events in the form of a deployable Crate\n♦ Hilarious story and voice overs\n♦ Achievements for playing the game basically\n\nNow don't get me wrong there are many positives, but still not every game is perfect and this one has the following negative points:\n\nNegatives:\n♦ Accuracy of the shots are slightly off\n♦ Cheats which can be used to get the achievements\n♦ Waves per level are way too long\n♦ Can get repetitive quite quickly\n♦ Little overpriced as I got mine in a bundle and Indiegala gave it away free\n\nImprovements:\n♦ Fix the Accuracy\n♦ Make Cheats only usable once finished the game\n♦ Lower Waves per round (So it feels less repetitive)\n\nOverall, in my opinion, the game is hillarious, fun and worth playing despite the accuracy of shots being slightly off and the slight repetitiveness. Though if you don't use cheats, enjoy easy to get achievements and love a laugh whilst playing a video game, then I highly recommend this for you.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this 3.5/5!\n\nPS: If you try and get all the stars for every level in the game, you'll be there for a while making this game have very godo replay value!","November 8, 2014","true","3.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #36 - The Culling of the Cows\n\nThe game description notes that this is a combination side-scrolling shooter/tower defense game.  But I wouldn't put much emphasis on tower defense.  Really the focus of this game is on the shooting.  The gameplay primarily consists of you shooting at cows which charge at you from the right side of the screen.  You have to be lined up vertically with the cow in order to hit it when you shoot.  This is a fair bit trickier than it sounds, as the side scrolling perspective works against you here.  I had a lot of cases where I was sure I was lined up, only to see my bullet miss.\n\nIn addition to shooting at cows, you also have to dodge them as they charge you.  If a cow touches you, then you are immediately gored to death.  There's no health bar or second chance here, so you have to be careful.  This was another case where I found the perspective difficult to deal with, as my bullet would miss the cow, but it had no problem goring me.\n\nThere isn't much of a tower defense aspect to the game, other than the fact that you are limited in how many cows you can let pass.   Let too many pass and you'll lose.  So you have to be pretty quick, and missing a shot will cost you valuable time reloading.  Some games you can reload your entire magazine at once when you run out of bullets.  But in this game, you reload a single bullet at a time, and it takes some time, so every missed shot counts.\n\nThis is where the strategy comes in, although I use that term lightly.  The game gives you money to spend on upgrades.  So for instance you can buy an upgrade that gives your gun a laser sight, to help you line up your shots (it didn't help me at all).  Or you can buy an upgrade that lets you load an additional bullet at a time (far more useful).  You can also upgrade your ammunition.  Since money is limited, the strategy comes in wisely spending what you have on the right items.\n\nThe other bit of strategy comes in the form of a parachute that drops a care package with something random that's useful.  It takes a while to recharge so the trick is deploying it when you start getting overwhelmed.\n\nThe graphics are pretty simplistic, but I did like the art style.  I wasn't as impressed with the animation, particularly for the player.\n\nOverall I found the game to be more difficult than I expected, due to the one 'one touch and your dead' mechanic.  In fact I never made it past the 4th stage in the time I played.  But I figure if the game is already that hard for me, I'm probably not missing that much other than even harder enemies to kill and more variety in weapons, etc.\n\nWhen you add in the $12.99 price tag, I really can't justify that for a game that I had so little fun with.  There are far better shooters, far better tower defense games, and far better games in general for the money.  Culling of the Players would be a more accurate title for this.","October 21, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay itself is repetative, with level after level of Cow Culling as one would expect from the title. Basics of the game include upgrading your weapon so as to blast the oncoming waves of cows, hippies and fat goth chicks. You would think that the gun upgrades would keep the game fresh for a little longer, but every level the upgrades are reset, and thus you just find yourself picking your favourite upgrades at the start of each level time and time again.\nHonestly this game is not worth the money they are asking. I got it with a 75% discount coupon, and even then I am wondering whether what I have recieved is worth it. If you purchase this game, get it for the cards (which is why I orginaly purchased it), and not for the gameplay, but it is quite a steap price merely for cards.","July 24, 2014","false","4.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","1"

But I think of it still as quite a humorous game and it adds up to how much I like it. The upgrades aren't really original same as abilities but still has some potential... if the devs decide to carry the game on.\n\nPros\n\n- Pretty stupid, the story and the overall design.\n- Horribly voice acted, which I think is a good thing.\n- It's fun, as a 5 minute timewaster and nothing more. Expect this to be played for at most 3 hours and then left in your steam library and with the cobwebs growing...\n\nCons\n\n- Fairly limited gameplay, gets repetitive.\n- Not completely original, the upgrades, the style of side scrolling defense and the overall feel, makes me wish this was free as a flash game.\n- Not entirely worth $13 USD, but if you have some money lying around when this is on sale. $3.79 (75% off) is quite the interesting deal.","January 20, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Even though you are clearly firing a spread of pellets from your shotgun, you have to be very careful that you're not too high or too low to hit the stampeding cow (all of which KILL YOU IN ONE HIT). Again, I'm used to this kind of system from old arcade games, but it feels unfair in this game, especially given the way that cows will run in fast at a diagonal. There's actually a laser sight upgrade for your shotgun, but it doesn't help much.\n\nYour shotgun has a high ammo capacity (especially if you upgrade it) but you have to reload each shell manually by pressing R. (This is more annoying than it sounds).\n\nYou have sentry guns and such that you can activate to kill some cows for you, but you have to activate most of them at just the right time, which is not really practical with the standard mouse+keyboard controls.\n\n...What's that you say? You'll just use a controller with a nice, convenient button for each trap? Nope, sorry, but controller support is AWFUL. You can only move around with the directional pad (the sticks do nothing!), and there are no dedicated buttons for the traps and upgrades. (The game actually tells you "Controllers are for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!" when you select it in the options menu. That's the quite the excuse for terrible support...)\n\nAlso, the levels end up covered in so many cow corpses that it becomes difficult to tell which still need shooting (some of the basic enemies stop moving for a second or two, which ends up faking you out) and of course having to climb over dozens of their fallen cow-sisters doesn't slow them down at all.","May 28, 2015","false","4.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The mechanics basically boil down to a unidirectional horde-mode shooter with Zero enemy intelligence and Zero chance for player creativity.  The "Assists" are so overpowered such that it would be foolish not to use them at each and every chance, and the "Upgrades" are so unbalanced that it would be foolish to not buy the scattershot at the soonest possible instance.  Not to mention the pre-school level shooting mechanics.  For a "shooter", you might expect a fair modicum of skill necessary, but nope, you shoot in a straight line, can't aim, can't angle your shot, just from left to right in a 180 Degree line rendering the whole use of the mouse completely unneccessary other than for the sole purpose of having the "fire" button.\n\nThis would've been fine as a browser game, however, somehow it made its way to steam with an outrageous $13 price tag.

The game is interesting for a while, but that fades away sooner than later, thus the thumbs down. Keep in mind that the price you pay for it is a big factor: if you get it cheap, the relation cost-value can make the purchase worthy.\n\nCredit is due to the developers for trying hard to keep this game interesting for its duration, adding elements and in-game mechanics aimed at keep things interesting, but it wasn't enough to do the trick.

It has a funny little gimmic which is basically a nazi ufo turns the cows into zombies. So it's not that serious.\n\nGraphics:  The art style is okay, nothing special. Looks like a flash game.\n\nSound:  The enemies have good sounds (except that annoying crow) just like the weapons. I think the voice over work is rly cheesy sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. The music is repetitive as hell you won't stand it longer than like 2,3 levels. The problem is basically there is a 30 sec loop and nothing else except for the menu music.\n\nGameplay:  You have to shoot down cows and other enemies in front of you. There are many types of enemies like super fast cow,\ntank cow, a crazy cow that comes at you in a crisscross and many more. So the enemy variety is good. But the algorithm is easy: Is this guy ahead of the others? -> shoot OR is this guy faster than the others? -> shoot that first.\nThere are game modes like simple turret sectons, boss fights, 1 big wave, normal wave. You can upgrade your shotgun in the previous 2. There are ammo types like birdshot, buckshot, slug... each is different but I think the buckshot is your bread and butter because it shoots in a cone. And the awkward hit detection (or the sense of position I'm not sure) is really annoying and it puts you out of the mood. You can also upgrade your ammo capacity, reload speed, fire rate, and you can attach a laser pointer on your shotgun. These upgrades can be obtained by your starter and drop money. You can also call for a care packege which contains money or powerups like unlimited ammo, unlimited health, slomo... for a limited time. But I walked through them almost every time because of the awkward sense of position.\nYou can also call aids like air strike, napalm barrels, nuke and other over the top stuff.\nThe game gets really repetitive after 30-60 minutes. There is only one level type (The Farm) but it indicates like there will be other themes but no... just the farm.\n\nReplayability:  There are achievements per stage but you mustn't use the upgrade system or the aid system to earn these which defeats the only good thing in the game.\n\nOverall:   Pros:\nSetting\nNice upgrade system and air support bonuses\nGore\nTrading Cards\nCasual fun time for a few hours  Cons:\nOnly 1 weapon (except for the turret segments)\nAnnoying hit detection and sense of position\nMusic is bad and repetitive\nLack of variety in levels\nQuestionable game design\nThe Extras menu leads you to nowhere...\nHIgh price!\nVerdict:  It's not worth 11 euros for sure. If you want some mindless fun for a few hours then buy it on a sale. I had some fun but I had many many frustrated moments as well. It's an average game at best. Won't kill you but won't save you.\nMy recomendation is neutral but the actual price lowers it a little bit. Oh and if you want to play it the "fun" way it lasts 2 hours.","January 6, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd advice to get it on discount.\n\nIn Culling of the Cows you slaughter hundreds of cows, a couple of badgers and also some hipsters. All of them are zombies though. There's a reason for that revealed at the end but it's totally ridiculous like the whole idea itself. For whatever reason you don't want the monsters in your barn. You got to go through the farm utterly destroying all the undead bovine life forms with your trusty shotgun and (!) the muda♥♥♥♥ing airforces.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, this is rather fun and enjoyable. Voice acting is horrible though but for that matter the game lasts only couple of hours even if you try to ace everything.\n\nEvery level you begin with a shotgun shooting slugs. God promises to sell you better weapons and help along the way because he's a such good guy. He also sends you money to pay for all the stuff. Then you proceed to kill all the enemies rampaging towards you. You got to reload manually so proceed with care and precision. This can be annoying as the hitboxes are quite small. This also makes the spread-out ammo upgrade super useful.\n\nFrankly, you can only shoot forward and you're slow at walking, so sometimes you can't prevent a cow from passing or indeed killing you. This is where assists come in: you can call up airforces, bombings, sentry guns, fire walls, all kinds of overpowered defenses that will mostly take care of your job for you, with brief cooldowns in between. Still it often takes another try to ace any level, especially since that means you can't buy some overpowered weapons.\n\nIt wouldn't stay fresh for long but fortunately it's also quite short, the 40 levels taking only some 2-3 hours to ace. However, the short length is also a curse: it's not really worth the full price. However, at a decent discount or in a bundle, go for it.","January 20, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a large map, achievements and cards. Those usually come as a positive. I got the game for free so I'm pretty satisfied. All around it's quite a solid game, however I entirely disagree with the price tag as it should be lower.\n\n>I'd give it a 7.5/10\n>Pros: Solid gameplay, many levels, cards and easy achievements, some sort of minigame levels so it's not the usual defense type, hand drawn(?) graphics, gets challenging.\n>Cons: Gets a bit boring, reset after death so you start again at wave 1 of the level you're doing, price tag.\n\nProTip: When starting a level instantly buy your upgrades and try to get a 3$ bonus from the Care Package. Try to go with 1 level in your Z, 2 in your X, 1 in your C and finally get buckshots. Keep restarting until you get a +3$ and you're on for an easy game.

It's not exactly worth the value that I put into it, but putting money aside, this game is essentially a 2.5D Tower Defense game featuring Zambie Cows. You're the last living redneck living off the face of some rural area and your belief in God has given you the ability to receive care packages to take more undead cows down. Pretty unique if you ask me.\n\nAs far as gameplay mechanics go, I wish it was playtested a bit more. I probably did not play this long enough, but aiming the cows is just as hard as reloading; you only reload one buckshot each time you press the reload button, and there are times where the bullets go past the cow. There was an upgrade that allows you to have a laser sight on your shotgun, but it's not exactly as helpful as you would expect. (The cows are transparent to these laser sights)\n\nThat being said however, it's not a bad game. This game could pass off as a flash game you play online and this would be the "full version" to put it in a different perspective. Since I got this off a random steam key purchase, I'd have to say it was worth it.","May 18, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd advice to get it on discount.\n\nIn Culling of the Cows you slaughter hundreds of cows, a couple of badgers and also some hipsters. All of them are zombies though. There's a reason for that revealed at the end but it's totally ridiculous like the whole idea itself. For whatever reason you don't want the monsters in your barn. You got to go through the farm utterly destroying all the undead bovine life forms with your trusty shotgun and (!) the muda♥♥♥♥ing airforces.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, this is rather fun and enjoyable. Voice acting is horrible though but for that matter the game lasts only couple of hours even if you try to ace everything.\n\nEvery level you begin with a shotgun shooting slugs. God promises to sell you better weapons and help along the way because he's a such good guy. He also sends you money to pay for all the stuff. Then you proceed to kill all the enemies rampaging towards you. You got to reload manually so proceed with care and precision. This can be annoying as the hitboxes are quite small. This also makes the spread-out ammo upgrade super useful.\n\nFrankly, you can only shoot forward and you're slow at walking, so sometimes you can't prevent a cow from passing or indeed killing you. This is where assists come in: you can call up airforces, bombings, sentry guns, fire walls, all kinds of overpowered defenses that will mostly take care of your job for you, with brief cooldowns in between. Still it often takes another try to ace any level, especially since that means you can't buy some overpowered weapons.\n\nIt wouldn't stay fresh for long but fortunately it's also quite short, the 40 levels taking only some 2-3 hours to ace. However, the short length is also a curse: it's not really worth the full price. However, at a decent discount or in a bundle, go for it.","January 20, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game follows a farmer who tries to protect his barn/farm from the diseased alien cows and human zombies. The game is like a tower defense game, where you play the farmer shooting your way through hordes of cows, with a little variety here and there. The concept is okay but can get a little repetitious at certain parts.\n\nAlthough its a fun little game to play, there are a few problems. Firstly, the reloading of the gun. Although I understand that the developers wanted you to take care of not only shooting the enemies right in front of you but also taking care of your gun, however, this can get annoying and when you are in desperate need for ammo, you have to reload, and the reload speed is so slow, you might as well either let the cow into the barn or get yourself ripped apart by the cows themselves.\n\nAnother thing which really bugged me was that there was no checkpoint system whatsoever, this can get really frustrating as you immediately die, and if, let's say you were in Wave 7, you would have to begin all the way back to Wave 1! Very annoying!!\n\nAnother thing is the farmer himself, he walks too slow and his reload speed is slow too. I can understand they made him the stereotypical old hillbilly farmer, but whenever you are in a tight situation, your kinda stuck.\n\nFor the level of difficulty, its not as bad a RADical ROACH Deluxe Edition (which is made by the same people who made this!), however, without the checkpoint system and the slow walk and reload speed, you may need to repeat a stage more than 3 times! A thing which I learnt and really gets you fast running through the wave is to use the powers given to you (ex: A turret, or a meteor shower) wait until its done then shoot until it reloads, simplest way... and it worked for me!\n\nThe music can get a bit repetitious and annoying and the sound quality varies from time to time. Reminds me of the sound quality from One Finger Death Punch where the mentor would speak into the microphone that's recording his voice so close.\n\nThe story... I have no idea what the story is all about. The game literally throws you into the game without even telling you why the cows are mad as they are and why you are trying to protect your house and barn,  SPOILER ALERT! - or why there is a huge Nazi UFO attacking your house!  The game literally does not tell you what's going on, to get a glimpse about the story, I had to go and watch the trailer on their store page!\n\nNow to the recommendation, I have to say that the game was fun to play, however, for the price its asking for... no way would I recommend it, I got this game for free from a giveaway by the way. Its not worth the amount the game company is asking for! For its full price, I would not recommend it, BUT if it is either in a sale, price drop, giveaway, gift or even given to you as a free game like I got it then I would recommend it.\n\nRECOMMENDED :)  Provided it is in a sale, price drop, giveaway, gift or even given to you as a free game, otherwise...\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED :(  For its full price","June 4, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PROFY_GAMER/recommended/297020/","PROFY_GAMER","bot_2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PROFY_GAMER/","104 products in account","The Culling of the Cows is an absurdist gag game that, while it may provide you with all the rampant bovine slaughter you could ever dream of, is as of now not at all worth the price paid for it.\n\nAs a lone farmer stranded in rural 'Murica, you must overcome the armies of mutant cows, deranged hippies and obese gothic women that a Nazi UFO sends your way. By reading the previous sentence, it should be quite clear that this game is not taking itself too seriously. However, there is a clear difference between random humor with a purpose and random just for random's sake; this game strictly falls into the latter. Culling is basing its appeal entirely on the fact that the player gets to shoot cows...a lot. All of the other plot points mentioned in the beginning of this paragraph receive no explanation besides a single introduction screen per plot point, and are otherwise meant to serve as comedic masks for generic enemy types.\n\nThe game's fundamentals are disappointingly lacking. Gameplay is divided into levels that contain encounters in either standard "Waves" format, a variation of Waves that is only one large wave, or a last-stand turret mode called "Onslaught". The majority of the game's levels occur in the Waves format, with varying numbers and types of enemies and waves for each level. This variety does little to put off the repetition that sets in after a few rounds of slaughtering the same few animals and zombies over and over. The Waves format does allow for some character customization in weapon upgrades, but after a certain amount of experimentation I discovered an order of upgrades that, with moderate skill, could win all the levels. Some incentive in the level design to switch up gameplay styles would have gone a long way. The other gameplay mode, Onslaught, produces some of the most frustrating levels in the game due to sketchy hit detection, though it often provides a refreshing and enjoyable break from the Waves levels as well.\n\nVarious other parts of the game fail to stand out. The soundtrack isn't memorable and the art style has this feel to it that so many indie games seem to have, which at worst could be descibed as "one step above MS Paint". Largely, the game isn't bad-looking; it just has a habit of piling hundreds of multicolored cow corpses on the screen at once, which grates on the senses and leaves a lasting impact after seeing it over and over. Some parts of the game seem to be implemented strangely: controller support, despite being labelled as both "partial" and "full", relegates movement solely to the D-Pad, which is an odd choice. Culling's achievements are also strange: there are only five, four can be attained by the third level (two are bugged to only work with the keyboard) and the fifth is for beating the game. More achievements could help boost replayability, a facet which is important in this game considering it can be finished in just over three hours. Though most levels contain medals to earn for winning under certain conditions, the game doesn't offer rewards for earning the medals, which makes them largely meaningless. Perhaps tying some customization unlocks to medals would solve this issue?\n\nThough this game faces significant issues, I must give praise to the spirit of the developers. They've implemented some features like an internal cheat console, the achievements and trading cards by popular demand. Additionally, their desire to not make this game be simply a joke shows throughout the game. The farmer's voiceover has some genuinely unique and funny lines interspersed throughout the game, which work because the lines are not beaten to death in every level. As long as the developers stand by the good-hearted cow hate that is the root of this game, there's hope that this could turn into an indie cult classic in the future.\n\nThis game has set off on a mission: to spread the need to shoot cows whenever, wherever. It tries to achieve its goals through a game that has significant flaws. Should the developers focus on the problems that plague the core elements of the game, then this title will definitely deserve a second look. As of now, however, there is no way anyone would feel satisfied paying full price for this game. Save up for a sale, perhaps gift this to a friend in jest. Just...beware the cows. The Culling of the Cows gets a D.","June 9, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

COTC is simple and harkens to the classic flash game setup, but one thing that most can't deny is that it's downright polished, and lovingly polished at that.\n\nYou have a shotgun. God supports you with farming equiptment and artillery strikes. There is a nazi UFO flying around. There are cows. Zombie cows. There are also some normal zombies sometimes. No one cares about those. You shoot them til they're all dead, as of God's urging.\n\nThis is all you need to know, and honestly, it's not for everyone. The insanely cheap pricetag demands some respect, and there is a surprising amount of content to be had, with a wide variety of levels and challenges, on top of some badge challenges that, while have no incentive, are a fun thing to try and aim for. There are multiple shell types, and each are fun to mess around with, but the buck shot is usually your best bet. You get the point.\n\nThe artstyle is absolutely lovely, and the voicework, while obnoxious after a point, is surprisingly competant and hammy.\nThere is an ending, and an overall plot, which has a kind of sweet if you can get past the final boss (it's a doozy, trust me), but for basic stupid arcade slaughter, you'll absolutely get your money's worth.\n\nNot for everyone, and arguably not worth the full price.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to whatever the developers do that isn't a bunch of jigsaw puzzles.\n\n","September 15, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it really falls short of what one would expect of this type of game.\n\n-The game has an alright theme which gets a little cliche with the Nazi part and the hands of God.\n\n-The music has little variety in music which gets old quickly.\n\n- The game is far too easy. The enemies don't vary too much and some of the enemies seem pointless or almost to help the player. There is not too much balance and one ammo type is incredibly OP compared to other ones and some of the upgrades are really almost useless. The actives are very very overpowered with a short cooldown.\n\n-There are three level types aside from the two boss fights and some seem to just drag on.\n\n-There are three medals to each of the levels, but as there are no achievements or rewards that help your gameplay outside of these there's little to no incentive to getting these.\n\nTL:DR - This game is a poor base defense shooter with little variety. There are many of these flash online that are much better. With the exception of maybe the steam cards and an easy perfect game (With a bit of time dragging through it) I would not reccomend paying a cent on this game.","June 15, 2015","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never knew the game or looked it up on the store. I saw a giveaway and ended up getting this game, so I played it. MY first impressions when I saw the cow crossing the moon was "What the hell is this game?!", little did I know that some five minutes later i'd be saying "What the boring hell is this game?". First things first, this game is paid, that means, you expect a better quality than free games (at least of part of them) but what I really have standing on my library is a game I played 20 minutes that had no originality and only seemed like a generic scroller with waves of You Vs Zombs (like many other games, but they are normally browser ones and are free), secondly, the price, although I only discovered it when I looked up the game, I really think it's unfair, $12.50 aren't made to be spent on this things that I sincerely find useless (not games, but these copy pastes that are made only to sell, that don't entretain). And last, the quality, ok, I do know this isn't Microsoft or some big corporation, but I feel it had some bare development, for example, the controller support isn't good, after it curse you for choosing to play with it, it doesn't teach you how to use it on the tutorial, and doesn´t even allow you to do the power ups with the controller. I really feel this game should be free and isn't complete.\n","June 19, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

COTC is simple and harkens to the classic flash game setup, but one thing that most can't deny is that it's downright polished, and lovingly polished at that.\n\nYou have a shotgun. God supports you with farming equiptment and artillery strikes. There is a nazi UFO flying around. There are cows. Zombie cows. There are also some normal zombies sometimes. No one cares about those. You shoot them til they're all dead, as of God's urging.\n\nThis is all you need to know, and honestly, it's not for everyone. The insanely cheap pricetag demands some respect, and there is a surprising amount of content to be had, with a wide variety of levels and challenges, on top of some badge challenges that, while have no incentive, are a fun thing to try and aim for. There are multiple shell types, and each are fun to mess around with, but the buck shot is usually your best bet. You get the point.\n\nThe artstyle is absolutely lovely, and the voicework, while obnoxious after a point, is surprisingly competant and hammy.\nThere is an ending, and an overall plot, which has a kind of sweet if you can get past the final boss (it's a doozy, trust me), but for basic stupid arcade slaughter, you'll absolutely get your money's worth.\n\nNot for everyone, and arguably not worth the full price.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to whatever the developers do that isn't a bunch of jigsaw puzzles.\n\n","September 15, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here are the issues:\n\nRepetitiveness:\nObviously in any tower-defense type of game you are going to see some repetitiveness involving the levels that you play. However, I feel that this game does an okay job when it comes to level variety. There are 3 types of levels that you can play,  but they are all basically the same type of level just with a minor change that doesn't make it stand out to the others.\n\nLag:\nAlthough I do not usually write about lagging issues in a review due to me playing on a laptop and it usually being on my side of the experience, there is a major issue that needs to fixed ASAP. This has to do with the dead bodies left on the screen. If you notice in any other tower-defense game such as Plants Vs. Zombies for example, the bodies always disappear after a short while of sitting on the ground. This game does not do that, and I found that as I progress on through the waves of enemies, their bodies stay laying on the ground and actually cause the game to slow down and lag making it nearly impossible to successfully complete the level.\n\nSo is the game fun? Yes. I enjoy this game very much cause it does a great job at being a game that is challenging while still being fun. Is it worth $13? As it stands, no. The only reason I got this game was through a key giveaway for the game and I of course enjoy free games. I was shocked however to see that the price of this game to be $13 when stopping by to write a review.

This could easily have been a free flash game on Newgrounds and probably would have been a few years ago.\n\nThat said, the game is a lot of fun for what it lasts (about 2 hours). Anyone who loved Plants VS Zombies will feel right at home with the general atmosphere and charm that pervade it.\n\nThe game could have definitely used a little more playtesting; not because it's broken or anything, but because of how easily exploitable it is: the spread gun (activated by pressing 6 on the keyboard) is incredibly overpowered, and will easily dispatch hordes upon hordes of enemies without any difficulty, completely eliminating the need for accuracy. Couple that with readily accessible upgrades for larger magazine, faster reloading and fire rate, and you will soon put up a barrage of fire that won't let anything through.\n\nAlso overpowered are the special "killstreaks", like sentry guns and helicopters, which are fine per se, but have cooldowns that are way too short, making them easy to spam, especially when you get four slots of them.\n\nExtra challenge is available under the form of medals for each level, daring you to play without upgrading your gun or using any special ability, although as far as I could see, the game doesn't seem to offer any reward for completing them.\n\nDefinitely get this while it's free or when on sale for under 2 bucks for an evening of quality uncomplicated entertainment, just do not fork out the absurd $13 asking price which, in the end, is the only major flaw of this cool little game.","May 27, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Otherwise it's way too expensive for what's inside of it technically and content-wise.

I never knew the game or looked it up on the store. I saw a giveaway and ended up getting this game, so I played it. MY first impressions when I saw the cow crossing the moon was "What the hell is this game?!", little did I know that some five minutes later i'd be saying "What the boring hell is this game?". First things first, this game is paid, that means, you expect a better quality than free games (at least of part of them) but what I really have standing on my library is a game I played 20 minutes that had no originality and only seemed like a generic scroller with waves of You Vs Zombs (like many other games, but they are normally browser ones and are free), secondly, the price, although I only discovered it when I looked up the game, I really think it's unfair, $12.50 aren't made to be spent on this things that I sincerely find useless (not games, but these copy pastes that are made only to sell, that don't entretain). And last, the quality, ok, I do know this isn't Microsoft or some big corporation, but I feel it had some bare development, for example, the controller support isn't good, after it curse you for choosing to play with it, it doesn't teach you how to use it on the tutorial, and doesn´t even allow you to do the power ups with the controller. I really feel this game should be free and isn't complete.\n","June 19, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PROFY_GAMER/recommended/297020/","PROFY_GAMER","bot_2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PROFY_GAMER/","104 products in account","The Culling of the Cows is an absurdist gag game that, while it may provide you with all the rampant bovine slaughter you could ever dream of, is as of now not at all worth the price paid for it.\n\nAs a lone farmer stranded in rural 'Murica, you must overcome the armies of mutant cows, deranged hippies and obese gothic women that a Nazi UFO sends your way. By reading the previous sentence, it should be quite clear that this game is not taking itself too seriously. However, there is a clear difference between random humor with a purpose and random just for random's sake; this game strictly falls into the latter. Culling is basing its appeal entirely on the fact that the player gets to shoot cows...a lot. All of the other plot points mentioned in the beginning of this paragraph receive no explanation besides a single introduction screen per plot point, and are otherwise meant to serve as comedic masks for generic enemy types.\n\nThe game's fundamentals are disappointingly lacking. Gameplay is divided into levels that contain encounters in either standard "Waves" format, a variation of Waves that is only one large wave, or a last-stand turret mode called "Onslaught". The majority of the game's levels occur in the Waves format, with varying numbers and types of enemies and waves for each level. This variety does little to put off the repetition that sets in after a few rounds of slaughtering the same few animals and zombies over and over. The Waves format does allow for some character customization in weapon upgrades, but after a certain amount of experimentation I discovered an order of upgrades that, with moderate skill, could win all the levels. Some incentive in the level design to switch up gameplay styles would have gone a long way. The other gameplay mode, Onslaught, produces some of the most frustrating levels in the game due to sketchy hit detection, though it often provides a refreshing and enjoyable break from the Waves levels as well.\n\nVarious other parts of the game fail to stand out. The soundtrack isn't memorable and the art style has this feel to it that so many indie games seem to have, which at worst could be descibed as "one step above MS Paint". Largely, the game isn't bad-looking; it just has a habit of piling hundreds of multicolored cow corpses on the screen at once, which grates on the senses and leaves a lasting impact after seeing it over and over. Some parts of the game seem to be implemented strangely: controller support, despite being labelled as both "partial" and "full", relegates movement solely to the D-Pad, which is an odd choice. Culling's achievements are also strange: there are only five, four can be attained by the third level (two are bugged to only work with the keyboard) and the fifth is for beating the game. More achievements could help boost replayability, a facet which is important in this game considering it can be finished in just over three hours. Though most levels contain medals to earn for winning under certain conditions, the game doesn't offer rewards for earning the medals, which makes them largely meaningless. Perhaps tying some customization unlocks to medals would solve this issue?\n\nThough this game faces significant issues, I must give praise to the spirit of the developers. They've implemented some features like an internal cheat console, the achievements and trading cards by popular demand. Additionally, their desire to not make this game be simply a joke shows throughout the game. The farmer's voiceover has some genuinely unique and funny lines interspersed throughout the game, which work because the lines are not beaten to death in every level. As long as the developers stand by the good-hearted cow hate that is the root of this game, there's hope that this could turn into an indie cult classic in the future.\n\nThis game has set off on a mission: to spread the need to shoot cows whenever, wherever. It tries to achieve its goals through a game that has significant flaws. Should the developers focus on the problems that plague the core elements of the game, then this title will definitely deserve a second look. As of now, however, there is no way anyone would feel satisfied paying full price for this game. Save up for a sale, perhaps gift this to a friend in jest. Just...beware the cows. The Culling of the Cows gets a D.","June 9, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BringTheNoiseGaming/recommended/297020/","BringTheNoiseGaming","C3LT1C W4RCRY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BringTheNoiseGaming/","63 products in account","As many of us are aware, the "indie developer" scene is exploding as of late when it comes to game creation. With so many independent companies trying to stake their claim in the gaming world, it's tough to keep track of games that are truly worthy of attention, versus those that are... well... just white noise. Among these developers is a company by the name of Decaying Logic, and they have created a unique take on the sidescrolling shooter with "Culling of the Cows."\n\n"Culling of the Cows" is game that is based around, you guessed, killing hordes of livestock that seem to have been infected or otherwise possessed by some strange force. Rather than feeding on hay or grass like their "more alive" brethren, the cattle of CotC prefer the taste of meat. Thankfully though, "God" and his newly appointed tool of destruction, Sammy, have something else in mind: to eliminate the existence of these flesh-craving, ravenous bovine zombie hordes. The entire game revolves entirely around this idea and it is very well executed in doing so.\n\nThrough each level, the player is given the option to choose between several different types of ammo that range from the typical 12 gauge buckshot, all the way up to exploding rounds. These ammo types can be purchased with the in-game credits that are given to Sammy at the beginning of each level. Not only does Sammy old boy get credits at the start of each stage, but he also has the chance to earn more by supply drops. Supply drops give the player a random chance to get certain temporary upgrades, such as the aforementioned credits as well as ammo reloads or speed boosts just to name a few. On top of these supply drops (if the level permits) Sammy can call upon God to rain down various "miracles" which, in all honesty, is pretty much a full military arsenal to rain down death upon the infected livestock. The fun doesn't stop there though!\n\nAside from all of the neat little upgrades and quirky buffs given to the player, there is also quite the selection of enemies. Some easy to kill like the typical black cow, while others... well... they need a little more "convincing" in order to admit defeat at the hands of our hillbilly protagonist. The levels are numerous and the entertainment value can be described as somewhat worthy. At times, the game will seem to get redundant, but it's definitely a must-have if you are in the mood for getting your hands dirty with a little mindless arcade "shoot to kill" action.\n\nAs far as true replay value goes, there might be some to be considered. Given the short nature of the game, speed runs can most definitely be considered. Or... if you wanna try your hand at a perfect run on every level, that is most certainly an option as well!\n\nOverall, Culling of the Cows makes its unique mark on the Indie Dev world and although it is rather short in gameplay length, the features that are included make it well worth the price. Whether you are looking for a time killer, or wanting a new "speed run" challenge to compete with friends with, or even just looking for a good challenge to achieve that perfect score, CotC definitely delivers.\n\nFor more information on Culling of the Cows, or to download the game for yourself, please visit:\nhttp://decayinglogic.com/the-culling-of-the-cows/\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to check out my other content!\n\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9wBb1EsrvF6mEPTWD1d0qA\n\nBlog: http://btngaminggamereviews.blogspot.com/\n\nTumblr: http://bringthenoisegaming.tumblr.com/\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @BTN_Gaming","October 25, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have a base, which is a barn, obviously, and you got to keep the undead cows away from your barn using your shotgun. You can upgrade it with money you get at the beginning of each level, but it isn't much, and gaining extra dosh in a level is rather RNG based, so you got to make those upgrades count.\nAnyways, you can also buy other ammo types, use assists that may help you out in a pinch, ask for a supply drop which gives money or a powerup.\nThere are quite few game modes, not just the usual survive-for-x-waves. After completing a level you unlock the next one(s) and play those! You'll start getting more money to upgrade your weapon, but new cow types are also introduced so the game wouldn't get boring and it works. There are fast cows, exploding cows, drunk cows etc…\nAll in all an amazing game. I mean, instead of zombies you have cows!\n\nLil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsmCOOY-TFA","October 19, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is very simplistic where you need to defend your barn from zombie cows and a few zombie humans. Only reason i have it was due to random Steam keys of ♥♥♥.\n\nYour trusty shotgun can be upgraded on each stage ( the bullets that have spread make everything easier ). with the occsional care package you can call down from God to make things easier. The repeitive nature of this game might be off putting for some but if you seriously have nothing better to do then why not pick it up.\n\nThe game does have a few achievements so there is some incentive to play until the end but the ending is rather lack luster which is expected from a title like this.  There are stage challanges you can try to complete but you get no reward from them except bragging rights.\n\n\nSPOILER:\n\nGOD FINGER RAPES A UFO.","June 22, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this for free, yet still feel ripped off.","December 4, 2015","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls are irresponsible, it's hard to hit anything because cows are strangely drawn and reloading is horrible. I saw better free games on many sites. It's not worth buying.
