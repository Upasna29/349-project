As with most of the choice of games, it sort of pales in comparison to choice of robots in my opinon, but no, bad Gman, mecha ace fixed a lot of problems i have with the others before they were even problems. First thing, the relationships aren't handed to you this time, which is a great upgrade from champion of the gods, in which you could be a blood-spattered barbarian and the timid princess would still be tripping herself reaching for your...well you get the point. This game in particular does a great job of making you feel like you've accomplished something when you actually just picked the logical option in a life or death situation, the story's "DIscount star wars" as all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, right down to a pretty major plot point which I won't spoil, but it can't be blamed as it does a good job of making up for it.\n\nThe combat's about as involving as it gets with text adventures, by which I mean, about as involving as hearing a witness account of an epic godzilla fight from a guy who was watching it from the moon with some seriously effective binoculars, but that can't really be helped. The characters feel...sort of human? It's not that easy to relate to them, but once again, text adventure limitations. One negative point, I've gotta say they missed a trick with the enemy faction, the way they're portrayed they act and talk the same way the empire from star wars does, hell, they refer to the first member we encounter as an "Imperial" for god's sake, yes I know that's standard for empires, imperial being a member of an empire, but...I'm getting off topic. What I'm trying to say is that they're painted as a faction of complete psycopaths, the furthest we get on the spectrum of "Doing what I think is right, Call of Duty is me" is a text option saying "I shoot to injure, he's just doing his job" yeah, sorry mate, but this guy's job description seems to include "Must strangle one orphan kitten per week" or something of the like.\n\nIn short, not as good as choice of robots, but just below it, along with most of Choice of's other titles, pick it up, it's dirt cheap and you won't feel that money was wasted. 7/10","August 22, 2015","true","3.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Somehow ended up getting an achievement for still having everyone alive at the end of the story in spite of my efforts.\n\nI failed at failing.\n\nThere's a handful of spots where taking just the right option can lead to weird disconnects between events (like when I cut the enemy's arm off, removing their monosaber with my plasma cutter, then have to be careful because my chain knife I'm not using isn't a match for the monosaber they don't have any more), but even with those rare moments, the writing is pretty good, and every path through the story is interesting and unique.\n\nIf you're looking for something other than a choose your own adventure novel you can play on your PC, then you're definitely looking in the wrong place, but if you like those stories, and want one with giant robots, this is a great story and it works well.","November 24, 2015","true","69.7"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","11","17","6","0"

It could almost as easily have been a WW2-themed tale of the travails of a Panzer Squad.\n\nIf you've read other Choice of Games, especially those on mobile, be aware that this is NOT their usual fare.  Most decisions focus on tactical squad command decisions: flank, charge or wait, attack at close or long range, delegate a task or assume command, etc.  These are well-written and implemented sensibly and thoroughly.\n\nHowever... characters fall into military tropes (enemy ace, commanding officer, wide-eyed rookie) instead of the usual Choice Of soap opera.  Romance is implemented, but almost grudgingly.  The gender of romanceable characters is randomized by default (this can be over-ridden), and as far as I can tell only F/M or M/F romances are allowed.  (I mention this only because most other games by this publisher go out of their way to be inclusive of all preferences when it comes to romance.)\n\nIf you enjoy the more serious aspects of the Gundam anime, or regularly read WWII memoirs in between PBEM rounds of a Slitherine wargame, you're sure to find a lot to like this game and it's absolutely worth full price.\n\nIf you're looking for something character-driven, emotional or romantic, the company's other works of interactive fiction are probably a better choice.","January 3, 2015","true","2.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I lost literally almost my entire side of my military, including ones I loved but later was treated to what seems like a somewhat rushed ending. It was likely the choices I made that affected my outcome but it was almost like a cliffhanger where you wanted to play the sequel.  I probably know the "end end" result but it would have been nice to (as Mortal Kombat would endorse...) "finish him/them!".  Still very satisfying but would have been even more grandoise if there was a sequel or maybe just 2 more pages of epilogue focusing more on the relationships I had developed  and/or lost (moreso a nod to how HeroesRise ended in each game).","December 15, 2014","true","13.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The game is not really about mechas, though--it's about your choices and how you interact with a small set of characters. I really liked that, because it meant you could actually care (or not) about them.\n\nYour choices offer you some semblance of RPG character development--developing your piloting, tactics, willpower or leadership. The choices really matter in the sense that you could see totally different outcomes depending on what you've done. Some characters can die or live depending on what you do. However, the actual acts are always the same (with differences in the details).\n\nThe game is short, which I actually quite liked--it felt quite the right length, neither stretched nor cut short. I finished my first run in ~3-4 hours. The 2nd run was done in 1 hour or so, since I only had to read the different scenes where I'd taken different actions.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game if you're a fan of fiction or interactive fiction. It's fun.","December 14, 2014","true","5.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But this isnt the first time I've played choice of games product (life of a wizard was awesome) so while I enjoyed the story, I was honestly a bit, unsatisfied. There wasnt enough depth in this game.\n\n\n*Spoilers*\n\nAny stat that goes above 4 (starting 2) ensures that you succeed every related option.\nAnd with the scarce amount of stat increasing/decreasing choices, this results in very limited dimensions for character ability development.\n\nThe custom modification on your starting mecha doesnt carry over to the lionheart. Since the custom modification is given to you in recognition of your past accomplishments and current standing, it should have made sense for the game to grant you a similar customization for the lionheart, especially if its something as simple as a custom paintjob.\n\nOh, and if you picked the thruster mod (+1 pilot) and reload checkpoint right after your first save, you permanently gain the stat bonus (this is most likely a glitch and doesnt work for others)\n\nThe war, or at least the part we get to experience, is freakin short. I know its important to keep a tight pace going, but perhaps the writer could have added a portion/storyline during the early stages of the war, about how the protagonist becomes who he is now, instead of three flat choices and a few paragraphs to cover 5 years of mecha piloting. (The amount of influence the first choice had on your character was just ridiculous)\n\nLastly, a personal rant\nNo matter how badly some people dont want to admit it, this is TOTALLY a Gundam story.\n- half masked rival CHECK (and you thought you could get away if you changed the color of the mask?)\n- same rival/antagonist that has extereme philosophy about war and equally extreme sense of chivalry/honor CHECK\n- accidentally stumbles upon WHITE PROTOTYPICAL mecha and gets chosen as its pilot CHECK (seriously bruh?)\n- Earth federation vs space colonies\n\nLook, I love gundam, and I have no problem with this being similar to gundam, its actually great, just stop trying to deny it.\n\nFor the record, I still recommend this game to people who havent tried choice of games, but as a fan, I don't think there's anything wrong with always wanting more. The fact that choice of games have steered away from traditional/cliche combat heavily themed RPGs makes me that much pickier when it comes to this particular game. it's probably also the one and only mecha text based rpg game out there.","November 29, 2015","true","11.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

This shouldnt have been that hard just make some anime stereotype characters, make them fun and interesting, have lots of cool action scenes, and dont rush the ending.\nI will be fair and say that the one thing it does well is introduce some mechanics that I had not seen in the Choice of Games before. Such as a save state, although you rarely ever see it and your actions have so little consequence, or when they do their consequence is revealed too far ahead in the story. There is also an interesting mechanic to choose the gender of certain side characters so that every male otaku can have the harem anime they have always wanted to be the main character in and every girl can finally get a harem anime of their own.","July 13, 2015","false","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadwarder/recommended/318330/","roadwarder","roadwarder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadwarder/","21 products in account","Before anything else, Mecha Ace is a war story, and it’s a damn good one. This story is dark. If you screw up, there are HUGE consequences. Sometimes the game even drifts into sci-fi-horror territory. The backstory and world are rich and well-written, so much so that there’s a whole guide to read in the menu. But despite all of the tactical military jargon and in-depth descriptions, the game doesn’t expect you to memorize how all of the technology works, like other war-based Interactive Fiction games I’ve played. Decisions are streamlined and easy to understand, and usually boil down to what kind of tactics you want to use in battle. Rush in and overpower them? Stay at a distance? Etc. Mecha Ace also utilizes a feature that I really wish more games from Choice of Games would use: checkpoints. It's really nice being able to go back to a checkpoint instead of all the way to the beginning.\n\nRomance is always a hyped up feature in Choice of Games games (that is really redundant to type). I read another review of Mecha Ace that said that the romance in this game almost feels reluctantly included, and I would agree with that. I only encountered a potential romance plot with one of the four or five potential NPCs, and I chose not to pursue it because that character just wasn’t all that interesting to me. Whatever you have to do to start romances with the others, I never figured out. This isn’t a complaint, by the way. I knew from the beginning that romance wasn’t gonna be a high priority for me. I’m kind of trying to win a war, here. Priorities.\n\nBlue Masque was my favorite character. Her motivations were so complex and alien to me (she was female in my game, so that’s the pronoun I’m gonna use. I know her gender, along with some other NPCs, can be changed), but she was VERY guarded because she knew that I was completely against her personal philosophy, and I never got to fully get to know her. I really appreciated that she responds to the player differently depending on what kind of person they are, and I love complex motivations and beliefs, and characters that will stand by their beliefs, no matter how strange or alien those beliefs may be.\n\nMy only real complaint about Mecha Ace is that I had to bust out my thesaurus (aka Google) way too often. The game likes to use really big, fancy words that don't normally appear in everyday conversation, and it likes to use them a lot. I shouldn't have to use Google to figure out what the characters are talking about. Beyond that, though, this is easily one of my favorite Interactive Fiction games I’ve ever played, and I highly recommend it.","July 1, 2015","true","23.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As an avid reader its a nice change of pace. I do think that the story could do with some music, but thats just me.\nThe story almost reminds me of the story of Sunrider with a few splashes of Code Geass, although that might just be me. I love it so far and would recomend it to anyone who loves a good story.","July 22, 2015","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean that the choices are extremely hard to make and what they will lead to is hard to determine, every choice means something and you can't just go back on it without suffering some losses. And that is a good thing. Sometimes with Choice of Games's games I can just rn through them and easily find the best scenario ending, but this one, gosh, I haven't I even finished it because I don't have the heart to see everything crumble around me and not go my way. This game gives a good dose of cold, hard reality and that gives it heart.","July 21, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thoroughly enjoyed.\nmy only complaints are that some of the achievments are a little broken, I wish i could have saved watanbe and chief (also their deaths were brushed aside eventhough i had romanced watanbe) and the checkpoint system is broken it should have been a save system that you could select save slots throughout a story.\noverall very well crafted (regardless of the terrible name that sounds to generic)\nfluid gameplay without skipping a beat (checkpoint system is broken though)\nand decent character arcs (with some debatable decisions to just kill off 2 characters without deep impact to the character and a few minor flaws in character design that can be overlooked)\n\nI would recommend to anyone that is interested in story rich/driven games.","February 8","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Big fan of robots and mechs. I have put in a total of 11.6 hours as of this posting. Allowing players to pick gender and name is a really good and cool thing. You can even do the same for the other characters in the story. And with multiple choices in the game that allows you to play through it a lot more and have difrent outcomes.","May 8","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
