I don't want to give anything away about the story so I will start with an analogy, *not* an actual example. Imagine you are asked by a story to choose your favorite beverage - water, cola, or liquor. You answer water, only to be told you would have preferred liquor and now you are sad because you wanted to get buzzed. I am? I did?\n\nAgain, trying not to give anything away about the game, but give an *actual* example of what I mean this time ... on my playthrough, the story severely broke down in the end. It was clear that the later elements of the story were written from the perspective of the character struggling against the crisis unfolding, even if your previous choices made it clear you did not view what was happening as a crisis. In other words, I had to choose the same option about six times in a row to get to the next page so the story could tell me how worried I was again, even though I had just chosen not to be worried. To paraphrase the responses ... "It's terrible, you're distraught, you can't believe this happening. Now is the time to act!" Why? I've told you six times I don't care. Next page please ... "OK, but it's terrible, you're distraught, you can't believe this is happening." I can't? I have repeatedly told you to let it happen. Please just get on with it! "OK, but you view your special item as your one hope to stop this terrible, terrible thing!" No, I don't - get on with it! "OK, but ..."\n\nThe result of this defect is that for me, this title wasn't really choose *your* own adventure, more like choose *someone else's* adventure and be told how they feel about it. Therefore, I can't recommend this game based on my experience. I think the reason I don't find this defect in non-text-based games that feature choice is that there is no inner monologue to contradict how you personally feel about the choices. Just something to keep in mind, in case you are thinking of purchasing the game, but would be disappointed by such a disconnect should you deviate from the author's perspective. On the other hand, if you happen to agree with the viewpoint of the author, you would never notice the defect and might really love the story.","December 19, 2015","false","3.0"," 495 of 524 people (94%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","94","495","524","35","2"

Now doesn´t that sound just splendid?\n\nSadly this has to be the first choose your own adventure ebooks, which really fell flat for me in some regards.\nThe development of your own character skills is at nearly no point an important decision, the only thing that matters is research and the stats of the enterprise. While this may be realistic for a CEO, it is kinda dull and mainly influenced through the budget sessions.\n\nAlso the romance part (which for this kind of game should normally offer some options) is a bit lackluster... i kind of got forced into the gay romance line, as he was the only one available.. which didnt matter much anyway in the end.\n\nRegarding the story, it also got somewhat over the top for me, when time travelling became an issue. That´s naturally a very personal taste, but that part just didn´t work out for me.\n\nTo round it up, the end game also has some bugs into it, where people appear twice, while they should be actually dead already (mind you, that was also an important part of the ending judgement, so no small lapsus imo).\n\nSo, while the writing is mostly ok the overall game just had me dissapointed, especially so, since the premise made me very interested in it.\n\nConclusio: You surely can get more refined CYoA books by now, so if you´re no hardcore fan of the topic, you can skip this one.\n\nRating: 5/10","December 21, 2015","false","5.5"," 136 of 152 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","136","152","8","0"

All I can say is that this offers a large number of choices in comparison, and these choices have real impact on what happens and what options you have later on. More than your average Telltale Game I would wager. You also have a lot of control over your companies strategy and which augments you develope for profit or your own use (and you WILL use them).\n\nAlso, you can enter your own name to be referred to, and pick a gender INCLUDING options for "It's complicated but I guess I'll put ___" or "I won't answer this question". Nice touches.\n\nIf there is one downside, I couldn't find a "save" or "bookmark" option, so I had to do it all in one sitting. I'm probably overlooking something really obvious but in case I'm not, something to keep in mind.\n\nOh, and before I forget, the story is well written and memorable, with characters that I found interesting and believable in the world they're in.

If you're the kind of person that cares whether a game accomodates non-binary gender pronouns and the like then you'll find they've taken every measure for sensitivity's sake.  The power fantasy of running, lets be honest here Massive Dynamics from Fringe, is great fun.\n\nThe Bad:  Unlike most of their games there appears to be one path to win, or at least a narrower set of them than the usual.    At points it becomes less-than-realistic.  There is way more randomness than many Choice of Games entries with your resources which are what determines how much you can do and thus how much you can make.  So a bit of bad luck or one bad decision quickly snowballs into an unwinnable playthrough.\n\nThe Bottom Line:  A great game, but not as superlatively awesome as others from this publisher.  The skill development system (which normally is a glorified decision tree system, if you've skilled up in a given area more than X times then you can sweet-talk the guard if not... he kicks your butt) is reused to provide more freeform options.  It's a shame that they never really go anywhere interesting with it because it boils down to "have you checked enough boxes to win?"  Relies a bit much on guessing, the results of actions are not always logically connected to the input: a fatal flaw in a text-based game like this!  This is especially apparent in the first act.  Also, a lot of threads like the Romance options seem shoehorned in so they can say "has X romances!" on the promo blurb and have no bearing on gameplay in a significant way.  In one playthrough I was gay, in the next a lesbian, and the lesbian romance option was slightly more fleshed out (ooh, controversial!) because they went on vacation with me.  But beyond a few more scenes and a chance to ♥♥♥♥ off my partner by ignoring her wishes and engaging in corporate skulduggery she asked me not to, nothing of consequences was gained or loss.\n\nBuy this if you like:  Power fantasies, reading unique novels and genres, streamlined management sims","December 27, 2015","false","3.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Typically, I find stories with this format rather unappealing due to the vast scope of the world and its unnatural setting combined with a familiar story (magic/Aliens - CEO of corporation).

But MetaHuman Inc got very interesting really quick. You become the CEO of a company that creates super powers or enhancements and are able to choose from a range of ways you will manafacture them. I wont go too far into the story, but its very entertaining to be incharge of a large company and becoming a millionare. The story can get a bit much and boring at times but is fairly addicting as you start to have more freedom.

MetaHuman Inc. has enhancements such as physical enhancements and psychological enhancements, which you can receive yourself, which aids in a gargantuan way over the course of the game; you do not have to get any augmentations, but it is recommended you receive all of them. Will you continue to spread the corruption and foster the corruption of the company? Perhaps alternatively, do you plan to change it, for the better? Perhaps indefinitely? Will the company crumble, under your tutelage? May it serve as a beacon of what truly embodies an ethical and methodical or a daring, innovative company? Perhaps it may even just end up as another bankrupt company; way past its expiration date. Are you the type to take the fall for your own mistakes, or pin it on others? Are you an unscrupulous, venal and virulent impulsive corporate-overlord, or a sympathetic, cordial, honest and pertinent CEO, or something inbetween? Whom should you confide in, and whom should you be vigilant of? Perhaps even betray others? Will you become a hated person of the press, or a person whom is praised by the press?\n\nMetaHuman has 12 stats in total: the Executive Bio: Leadership, Resolve, Candor:Guile and Compassion:Ruthlessness, Company Profile: Image, Morale and Intimidation, Research Department Profile: Witchery:Superscience and Research Staffing\n\n--Executive Bio—\n\nLeadership is self-explanatory - the ability to lead. However, thematically with leadership, it is also to an applicable extent, how much your co-workers respect you - do they respect your final say? Or alternatively, would they argue and debate what you say right-off-the-bat, provided you have low Leadership. It is also the ability to keep people calm.\n\nResolve - the ability to follow through with your ambitions and resist and push on through hardships.\n\nCandor is quite simply being honest and open; frankness.\n\nGuile is simplistically how cunning you are - characteristic of a cunning, manipulative and lying CEO.\n\nCandor and Guile are a ratio - when you are open and honest, your Guile decreases, however if you are deceptive and/or you lie, your Candor would decrease, and obviously your Guile will increase.\n\nCompassion is simply if you have a good heart; you're altruistic.\n\nRuthlessness is the opposite of Compassion - if you do not have a heart and you do not mind firing employees just because they made a mistake, or making somebody 'disappear' because they may of gotten on your nerves or done something wrong, albeit un-fair, that is the natural nature of the Ruthlessness stat.\n\n--Company Profile--\n\nImage is how your company is portrayed, indicative to how you handle the press and the decisions you make. 'Your' business could be loved, despised or be seen as another typical company. Business is also reflective on your image as well; if you have bad business, chances are your image will be afflicted.\n\nMorale is the general-construct of your co-workers' conglomerate dispositions.\n\nIntimidation is how much your co-workers fear being insubordinate; a decent level of intimidation is adequate. It is also the ability to scare other people, simultaneously.\n\n--Research Department Profile--\n\nHead of Department is the person whom runs the Research Department; oversees everything, from development of Enhancements, to general well-being of fellow co-workers. There is 3 choices at the beginning of the game. A person whom specialises in Superscience, a person that is proficient at both, so you can effectively choose if you wish to go with Superscience or Witchery, or lastly, you can choose somebody whom specalises in Witchery.\n\nThe simplicity of these stats are sufficient enough, but at the same time, intricate and it tendrils its signifiance, while maintaining transparent simplicity as a stat.\n\nMetaHuman does an exemplary job of capturing the appeal of being a CEO of such a myriad company, with the benefits of a high salary, assets, expensive clothing, influence, and notoriety a respective position would bring. The CEO heavily-entangles himself with all of the interesting affairs of being a CEO of such a large company would entail: the press, distribution of the company's' budget each month, donation to an event-triggered charity, detective work, a company similar to scale with yours, acting as competition, coordinating and/or being in the field with special agents, hunting down mythical creatures, apprehending somebody, or at times, preventing a crisis that could potentially be damaging to your company if you do not handle it correctly, provided it goes wrong.\n\nThis fantastic and interesting installment of this multiple-choice-game tackles interesting philosophical questions - questions that can morally leave you absolutely-conflicted; choices that both seem absolutely morally-viable, but one or the other leaving a catastrophic and baleful mark on the world. Finally, what it is like to truly make a difference - good or bad.\n\nMetaHuman Inc. additionally provides some diverse dialogue options and methods of dealing with certain situations: ranging up to 6 options on a solid-basis, which solidly-provides interesting repurcussions, albeit some seem completely-forgotten about -- some.\n\nHowever, this game is not without its flaws - it has issues. The romance branches seem fairly lackluster, being fairly-simplistic and rudimentary and not having genuine-depth, albeit it being at a 'Satisfactory' level. This game also skims over some decisions, albeit they may not be copious, it still makes a difference, in terms of the competency of a 'multiple-choice-game.' This applies to events that are not necessarily imperative to the story line. It also does not completely do an exemplary job on an alternative ending, rather it gives you an alternative way to replay the game, but in an interesting fashion.\n\nColloquial Verdict: Overall, this game was a fantastic experience. Fantastic writing, not as descriptive for my liking, but still good, concise writing nonetheless! This game gripped me all the way to the ending, me playing for roughly 4 - 5 hours straight, non-stop, and I recommend this game to almost anybody that is interested in science-fiction, or likes thought-provoking, indelible and interesting games -- a poignant game. I give this game a 8.5/10, for its exemplary-execution of the grand concept, the good writing, the intriguing story. What prevented this game from becoming great (in my opinion) is just some work with some of the alternative endings, and the lackluster romance-branches. Other from that a FANTASTIC game.","March 19","true","12.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

This time out, you're thrust into the role of a CEO of a research company dabbling in making humans metahuman - sort of like superpower capitalism, except instead of being a superhero story, it is a cosmic horror story due to the price you have to pay for the research. Nice twist, that.\n\nUnfortunately, like some Choice of Games games, unless you choose a polarized approach and stick to it 95%, you're not getting a decent ending. This makes your first playthrough, the blind one, essentially poking at the game to see what major milestone mistakes you can make, and then prepare for a 'proper' run to see a specific storyline formed by taking a coherent approach.\n\nOn the one side, it's a good thing, since this allows multiple reruns of the same game while seeing tons of new non-repeating content. On the other side, like in imperfect gamebooks, you can clearly see where the tracks cross, like "here's a dialogue option I would have picked if I picked THAT dialogue option two chapters ago... what I'm more interested in, is why there isn't a follow-up to the option I DID pick?".\n\nThe game suffers a bit from what I like to call the "Mass Effect Dialogue Issue": sometimes, the options you are offered aren't 100% related to what your player character ultimately ends up doing, although it has a lot less issues with it than, say, Hero Project. It's also highly unclear at times whether a decision result is calculated based on your stats or RNGed, a traditional issue of Choice of Games games that messed up my enjoyment of Mecha Ace greatly.\n\nAll in all, yes, it's a nice addition to the collection and a worthy recommendation to anyone, especially since the corporate backstabbing angle is weirdly complemented by the cosmic horror setting, but if you had doubts about these games before, this one will not change your opinion in the slightest.\n\nAlso, if you don't mind me saying this, the ending feels somewhat rushed and disjointed due to the need to tell three outcomes as a singular story, since way more focus is given to what your shareholders think of you rather than what state you leave the world in or what your decisions or indecisions did to the various characters. Yes, this will make the next runthrough as a heartless embezzler easier to do, but also sort of undermines any intent to play a person with a stern moral compass, I'm afraid.","April 1","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They've absorbed many, many hours of my time.  I went into it knowing exactly what it was, and was quite content with what I found.  All of the titles from Choice of Games that I've played have been enjoyable, but Metahuman, Inc. is the best one, in my opinion.  It's much more open-ended than some of the others, with more endings, and it takes a few playthroughs before you really get to know all of the characters.  I really felt like the enhancements add a lot to the game, where your ability to run your research department efficiently and the order in which you develop enhancements opens up new options during conversations and conflicts, and therefore new branches in the story, as well.\n\nTo address something I've seen others saying, I didn't experience much of a disconnect between my choices and the replies.  This one seems to be much, much better about it than at least one of the other titles I've played.  However, I'll admit that there are some endings I haven't pursued.

I would advise players with a low concentration span or who generally dislike reading to avoid it, if these traits do not descirbe you then I would recommend this game.

While I found the overall plot development less engaging than Choice of Robots (which is, by far, my favorite of these games atm), the people you interact with are written in a more evocative way than the relatively normal people you interact with in Choice of Robots.\nAnd you certainly can't pretend the plot isn't imaginative, even if it does use lots of tropes and some archetypes even.","January 9","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(especially if you like sci-fi/mystery genre, or if you like TV series like Heroes for example).\n\nThis is well worth the 5€, I personally was lucky to stumble to this while it was on sale for under 3€. Would probably have skipped it, if it wasn't for the positive reviews, so thanks to you all who have wrote reviews also.\n\nI just finished the story. Very immersive. If you've ever read a book to the late hours of the night from cover to cover, just because it's that good, this is it. But it's a game. And it's a book. I quite don't know what to call it - "interactive book" doesn't quite describe it well enough in my opinion. Something in between of a book and a game.\n\nAt one point, I spend almost 15 minutes on one page, thinking and trying to decide what to do based on all the information I had at that point, my suspicions of what's to come, all the possible consequences and outcomes of my actions.\n\nStill, it's very well written. Nothing is too ovbious, you can try to guess what will happen, and when you think you do know, it will suprise you.\n\nYou really get the feel that events are happening because of the choices you make. And there was only maybe one or two pages where it felt a bit like I didn't have enough options to choose from, which broke the illusion a bit (for a second).\n\nI will most likely play this through again at some point, just to see how much I can change the events. So, allthough the magic of this game is mostly on first experience, it does have some replay value also.\n\nI REALLY hope they will make a sequel for this book.\n\n10/10, would augment myself again.","January 1","true","15.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you value graphics over story or player decisions, this probably isn't the type of game for you.\n\nThis is a pretty fantastic entry, which combines compelling storytelling with interesting mechanics and choice that seem to actually matter. I also enjoyed the game testing my own detective skills at a few points, challenging me to solve a mystery with the game only giving me helpful clues for correct choices instead of the direct answer like so many other games do, making it seem challenging without being unfair or obtuse. I felt genuinely immersed when playing this, which seems odd for a cyberpunk-fantasy choose-your-own-adventure, but it was just a very enjoyable experience that I felt a part of.\n\nMy main criticism is that some of the decisions, especially the routine ones which you can adjust regularly throughout the game, should have to be confirmed before they are made permanent, as it is easy to make an error if you misclick or misread the option.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good story or enjoys a game where the player's choices actually matter.","December 18, 2015","true","18.8"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","16","34","3","0"

Seriously, as a tip to new players equip yourselves with enhancements, You'll need them.\n\nIn my first playthrough I was the "Bad Guy".

The story was superb and I'd love to see a movie made using the plot! It's quite interactive. The choices give enough for you to forsee the outcomes, but there's always a murkiness to it to remind you that the future is not as clear as you think. They don't just throw in some outrageous obstacles or interventions(though certain past actions and good planning will certainly help in the long run, so don't be shy with using your resources up).\n\nI've played a few text-based games, but this certainly grabs the top spot for me. The story was certainly unique, developing further and further into the sci-fi/fantasy genre(magic and science are tied together though there isn't exactly an in-depth discussion regarding this. Rather it just exists as it does. Tools of the overall plot). Then at the end comes the twist, with the final conclusion based on the decisions you take at the last pivotal moment.\n\nI just wish there were ways to have more influence on the behaviors and actions of some the close members of the character. Affect them in certain ways that would determine how they'd contribute towards the end, and perhaps affect how well they do their jobs.\n\nIf you enjoy ruthless shareholders, running a shady business to glory(or infamy), time travel, magic, science, and the occassional enigmatic alien making suspicious promises...then this is a game for you. Even in it's text based format, it isn't completely sparse of visual aspects(albeit they're colorful bars representing certain business and personal information) nor is it lacking in entertainment and action.\n\nI'm glad to have bought this game, and seriously hope this takes off  to become something greater.","December 18, 2015","true","4.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

For once, I feel like my decisions actually matter.\nHowever, your decisions don't so much change the events as they change how you handle those events, and there are definitely very clear "correct" choices.\nI can recommend this game only because of the low price point. It managed to keep my interest, but I doub't I'll spend a lot of time with it. Try it out and see if you like it, then get a refund if you decide you don't. 2 hours is more than enough time to get a good feel for this game.\n\nAnd lastly, I really have to point out that Paul Gresky is absolutely terrible at naming people.

The game even allows for diverse gender roles should you Identify as neither male or female exclusively.  25 minutes into this game I have just finished telling the press about my plans for MetaHuman much to their disapproval.

Trying to explain the plot is so difficult because of the interwoven themes and genres that baffles me still about how well it works.\n\nMechanically, I never felt once like my choices were just tossed off and without meaning, just a number that ultimately turns out the same. Every choice had weight. Some choices were difficult. Some were ultimately very satisfying. All were interesting.\n\nThat is something -very- hard to pull off these days, but through masterful writing and an impactful story, they have made it real.\n\nAll in all, this game is way more than what I had purchased it for. Not just for the fact that I'm probably going to restart the experience anew right after writing this, but for an experience unlike any story I've seen or heard of before.

This is my first text based game and I have enjoyed it for my first runthrough for the most part. Miss one opportunity and you get railroaded for better or for worse a couple choices down the line. I played leaning more towards diplomacy yet the only people that applied to were the staff I had immediate contact with. Choices that should have gone in one direction were taken in a complete 180. I "failed" the story yet it when the "epilogue" and it's choices come up that barely gets notice, like it was just swept under the rug, I honestly rate the ending I received (and there are definitely multiple to be had) as disappointing as Mass Effect 3 was pre-patch (too disappointed to actually go back and replay to see the differences after it). Overall the game is pretty decent and eats up more time than you realize and it definitely has some stumbling points, if I were to give this a rating out of 100 it would be about a 78, especially right now when it's only $3. Replayability is there though it might feel a bit tedious although you now have knowledge of what kind of enhancements can play certain roles at different areas of the game\n\nAlso, just because for whatever reason it helped me enjy it more, try picturing the CEO you replace as that Masrani dude from Jurrasic World, not sure why but his image is the first thing that popped into my head when they talk about him.","December 23, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this one. It was surpisingly deep, and the options available to you were clever and astonishingly varied. Many decision-based games have low replay value, but this one seems like it would only deepen given several repeat playthroughs.  I will certainly be trying other games by the same developer.\n\nThere were a few typos, which briefly shook my fervor. A minor quibble in most games, but in a text-based game it's a little more unforgivable.","January 22","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has some mechanics to it where you guide your company and pick and choose which Enhancements to develop but if you don't like CYOA games then you won't like this.\n\nHaving said that I really enjoyed this game, and as someone who grew up reading CYOA Books it was nostalgic and a lot of fun. I really enjoyed the plot and I think they did a really good job at creating this game.","January 11","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is fun and the story has some threads for a laugh. It is lightly wirrten, it doesn't overwhelm you with a text to read. The script gives you enough adequate choises to fit in with most of traits you'd like to play out. Buy it if you are looking for something different. If it is on sale, defenitly buy it.","May 8","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
