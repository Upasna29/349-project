It is the first early access game on steam. A game that has been in a state of early access for 4 years and 8 months(April 1st, 2011) and no sign of ever going gold. In fact, it has been so long since it's last update that it has almost been as long since it was updated as the offical launch of early access games on steam. If Valve had taken a look at how early access worked for this game I doubt they would have ever allowed any early access games on steam. Why any game that has not been updated in over two years without being formally released is allowed to stay avalible to customers to purchase is beyond me.\n\nTruthfully, it's not a horrible game but it is far from great. Most of my hours came from stress testing a video card. This game would cause crashes more often then any other I owned at the time. The rest came from the 2011 potato thingy for portal 2 launch. If your a fan of games that use your own music to generate levels I would recommend a bunch of others others over this one. Even Dejobann's other game AAAAaaaAAaaAAaaaaAAAA!!!!! does the concept much better and is more polished than this rendition. I just can't recommend this game to other people.","December 28, 2015","false","22.8"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","28","29","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/recommended/15540/","ajpos","Andy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/","483 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntro:\n\n1...2...3... Kick It is a music game modelled after Dejobaan's earlier game, "Aaaaaa," in which the player "base jumps" and avoids a series of obstacles on their way to the ground.  This iteration is only a spiritual successor, as Dejobaan has removed many of the more action-oriented elements from their formula and has instead tried to craft a new genre of relaxing music game with only two or three core gameplay mechanics instead of the many kisses, combos, landings, and tricks we saw in "Aaaaa." The concept is much simpler now: fly close to objects to earn something called "TB," and you also get something nice if that object is oriented towards the bottom of your screen. There are no landings, tricks, combos, or crowds to show off to. Because the game is STILL IN PROGRESS, I am trying to be as fair as possible. Please understand that any of the bullet points below may be changed or improved by the time you are reading this.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* The graphics are visually interesting, but there is still room for improvement. I imagine a music game should have something more than plain black backgrounds.\n\n* The Game is constantly updated.\n\n* Interesting and well-developed soundtrack. I am not super into music but I thought the lyrics and beats were fun to listen to.\n\n* The developers are some of the nicest people in the world. Drop by the Steam community forums and see for yourself: they respond to every bug, glitch, and criticism with poise and patience.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* Not all updates are good. For example, it used to have a nice voiceover AI in the menus, which for some reason was replaced by silence in the latest update. Silent menu screens? In a previous build, I was unable to load any actual levels due to the way the game saves music.\n\n* The full-screen is not working at the time of this writing. It opens a window large enough to fill my screen, but there is still the familiar Windows 7 title bar at the top.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n* There is nothing that I can see to qualify this as a music game. Some obstacles will "pulse" with the beat of the music, but everything else in the level seems to be pre-scripted. I can listen to Dolly Parton or speed metal while playing and get the same experience. My recommendation for the Developers would be to replace the black background with something colorful that responds to the music.\n\n* The free-falling mechanic is just not that interesting or immersive like it was in Dejobaan's first game (which was not very immersive to begin with). This feels more like a rail-shooter than a falling simulator. There is no rush of wind passing my ears, no way to slow or speed my descent, and absolutely nothing to remind me that I am falling down instead of running sideways or flying upwards.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBecause the game is still in development at the time of this writing, I think this review (and any others) should be read in that context. Unfortunately, at this stage of development, I never-the-less foresee "1...2...3... Kick It" as being noteworthy just for coming alphabetically in your list of games, and not for the enjoyable time you spend playing it.","December 15, 2013","false","0.9"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","39","48","0","0"

I've repeatedly contacted Dejobaan but have received nothing but lies (they claimed it was a priority but have released four other titles in the interim) and mocking shrugs (along the lines of "gee, we can't please all of the people all of the time"). Valve refuse to refund despite their complicitness in promoting it during a 2011 sale.\n\nThis is a total scam and should be avoided at all costs.

KICK IT! is a rhythm/skydiving game. It's AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! but the level design is set to music.\n\nIt's permanently stuck in early access, but oddly has been developed a bit over the years. It's gone through 2 or 3 major engine rewrites, but seems to be stuck in very early development anyway. Don't buy it if you expect a 'finished' game experience.\n\nThere are a few songs made for the game, which are decent.\nYou can hand it your music library and it'll try to generate levels based on that, but the music analyzer is buggy.\n\nThat's about all I can say about it because there's not that much to do in the game. While A Reckless Disregard for Gravity had point-collecting and levels to unlock, this game can't really do that because of how random the level design is. There's no progression and no sense of achievement because the game experience varies wildly depending on the randomness of the level generator.\n\nThe difficulty is pretty pointless because there's no death or failure state, just less points than you would have had for doing well. Also, there's no rating system or metric for how well you did, just an arbitrary number (and the devs have rewritten the scoring system a few times as well). If I get a 'high' score, I don't know if I actually did well or the song was just easier than most. Often, longer songs will net you more points by default because you get a few points per second, and longer song = more time to get points.\n\nI just can't recommend the game because even though it seems like a decent concept, it doesn't have that much potential and it seems to be totally dead.\n\nTo be a game I'd recommend, it would need:\n-an entirely different music analysis/level generator that actually makes sense for the song\n-a scoring system that can tell you how well you did vs. the difficulty and length of the song\n-some way to actually progress or increase difficulty over time, some way to actually fail a song\n-something that actually makes you move with the rhythm, like osu! or audiosurf. Playing with full audio is no different from having the music muted because the music only affects the quantity of obstacles, not their placement or their difficulty.\n\nAnd if the dev team hasn't done this in the last 4-ish years it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.\n\nThe problem is that even if this game escapes 'early access' status and fixes these issues, it doesn't seem like it could ever be as fun as AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! which still makes this a game I can't recommend. It has some potential, but when compared with other rhythm games or other arcade games, it just won't compete even as a 'finished' product. AaaaaAA only works because of the fluidity and uniqueness of the level design, and if you take that away or leave it up to a music analyzer, you remove the challenge of AaaaaAA and make it repetitive because all levels have to be (about) the same.\n\nUltimately, you should only buy it if you are a die-hard Dejobaan fan for completion's sake.","November 8, 2014","false","3.3"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","27","30","0","0"

I loved the other games Dejobaan have made in the past, and I was curious to see what they would do with Ugly Baby, so I was eager to pick it up. I didn't mind it being in early access since I had faith in their abilities to create a game (especially after Aaaaaaah), and it was one of the reasons that the Potato Sack from 2011 worked so well. There was a lot of good potential there.\n\nIt's been a few years now, and there's still nothing here but an incomplete game.

Do you wish it was easier? Do you wish there was less to do? Do you wish the cool level names were replaced with "City #"?

Then hoOooOooOOOooO BOY you're in for a real treat here.\n\nThis game has been "in progress" or whatever for two years and here's the entire gameplay experience:\n\n1) Pick level. If you pick the first two levels, skip to #5. If you pick the third level, skip to #4.\n2) Wait for the file browser to load. For whatever damn idiot reason, the game decides to scan the ID3v2 tags, which means that just displaying a single album's worth of songs can take about thirty seconds, and if you have one folder full of music then you're in for a real doozy of a wait.\n3) Pick a song you want to listen to.\n4) Wait about a minute for the game to load the level.\n5) Use the mouse to move around the level. Use the mouse buttons to rotate your field of view.\n5a) If a tall building is on the bottom of your field of view, your multiplier goes up and you get about 5 points per tick.\n5b) If you pass within range of a small building asteroid field, you get (100 x M) points per small building, where M = your current multiplier.\n5c) Occasionally the colors pulse, and for about 10% of songs you may notice the buildings being "built" around you at roughly the same pace as the beat.\n6) Collect your score and your "followers" (score / 1,000). Followers can be used for lots of things, such as "absolutely nothing".\n7) After you unlock the first four levels, the game really opens up, as now you can play the fifth city in any order you wish.\n8) There are only five "levels" in the game and three of them are various forms of simplified tutorials.\n\nTwo years of "early access" for this. Oh and they just opened up the scripting editor, so you can muck about there and maybe the game will build a spiral ramp in response to a certain portion of a song instead of a building asteroid field. Or maybe not.\n\nNot sure if there were more levels at an earlier stage of the game, but considering the leaderboards are entirely empty I'm willing to believe the people with the "beat level 15" achievement just used an Achievement Manager.\n\nOn the plus side, "Future Shock" is a really good song and whoever does the voiceover may well be the only chick in the history of indie games to actually know how to read lines without sounding like a terrified dyslexic shut-in with a gun to her head.

Like I said, the concept gets old quickly, and you'll find little to no variety when falling through the same geometrical obstacles and trying to align yourself with the targets.\n\nImho, there are much better rhythm games, and even better, games that let you use your own song library, so if you're looking for something like that, I recommend you look around instead of getting this one.\n\nSince I got this in the Potato Sack, quite a while ago, I don't feel that much ripped off but, seriously, I feel bad for whoever bought this from the store.","July 21, 2015","false","1.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

When I found out, 'Ugly Baby' was exactly that, I immediately bought it, although it stated on the store page (Early Access wasn't even a concept back then) that this game was still in beta, but the full release was an automatic update, as soon as it got out. I then realized that what I had bought was a very, very early just playable version with few different levels.\n\nBy now, time has passed and Dejobaan have release several other games, but this one is still stuck in development hell. I'd love to see a full version once and I appreciate the engine migration and all the stuff that happened since the potato sack like a few additional stages, but a full version is due since a very long time ago.\n\nWhen the full version is out, I'll properly review the game again.","May 17, 2015","false","2.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game is probably my largest disappointment.  They grew bored of the concept and abandoned it and the promise it had.  I like the idea of games generated by the music playing, and it's successfully executed elsewhere, but, not here.  It boils down to the fact that while this game exists, it's here, and it doesn't SUCK, it's not worth grabbing because there's no further promise to the game and it's really not all that finished.","January 17","false","0.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I decided to give it ago to farm some trading cards after this has been in my library for a year or longer. It is in Early Acc..wait what? A game released years ago is in Early Access? Yeah, it is. I didn't quite believe it until I saw the stamp on the store page and the multiple reviews and discussion threads referencing. Many players feel the developers are abusing the Early Access status as an excuse for the game "being worked on" and not up to people's quality standards. Yet, Steam users report that the game hasn't been updated in over a year, so the developer is definitely doing some thing shady. While I don't care enough about this game to feel like I was scammed, I would probably advise most people to not buy this game despite the game in my experience feeling solid and semi-enjoyable enough to be played and possibly beaten. I don't honestly think the game is bad, but the player/customer experience is heavily damaged by the developer's strange behavior.\n\nAnother strange factor is that apparently this game has been redone multiple times. The game I remember seeing from videos years ago (even from a 4 year old video on the Developer's own Youtube channel!) is vastly different from what the game is now. I have no idea if it is better or worse, but it's strange to see a game have a completely different art style and game mechanics from it's release.\n\nFor the most part, gameplay is like an endless runner or a rhythm game played in first person as if you are sky diving around large shapes. Levels have different requirments such as getting enough points by getting close to objects, collecting items, hacking flashing objects by pressing a button while near the object or flying through a open object as if threading a needle. It's a rather simplistic game, but I think it generally works well for what it does, just it doesn't do too much. Some levels are based on specific tracks and other allow you to choose from a list a songs - you should be able to load your own music as well, but I've read at one person mentioning issues with loading custom music.\n\nI think this game is rather alright, though probably a bad purchase due to developer scumbaggery. Fans of the other Dejoban games often recommend the other AAAaaaAA! falling score attacks games versus this one, so I would look into those first if this game piques your interest.","December 13, 2014","false","1.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/recommended/15540/","nww02","<Insert Name Here>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/","400 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo this game has had a whopping overhaul since I last played it.  Dejobaan have clearly lavished a lot of time on the interface.  The game is also totally different from the pre-alpha... Gone seem to be the crazy music-video like spirally tentacles and psychadelic backgrounds.. They've been replaced with lots of flashing and pulsing cubes.\n\nThe other major plusses for this new version are the radio voiceovers which are amusing, the music which is not too bad, and the controls which feel very fluid.  the "city map" screen is enigmatic in its inscrutibility... I can seem to play any of the "levels".. so why are they linked, as if it's some kind of progression?  What do any of the descriptions mean?  What's the benefit of playing any one level?\n\nThe answer, it seems, is "none of it makes a blind bit of difference".   All the levels look, feel, sound and play the same, except for a few which seem to be cut-scenes.\n\nSadly, the game is missing any form of coherence whatsoever.  I so dearly want to love this game. I really enjoy Audiosurf, but that has no pretence of being a "game".. just a "ride your music" simulator.\n\nWhat does 1..2..3 need?  Well, it needs a single-player game for starters:  Let the player play the game using pre-determined music to begin with.  Make it nice and easy.. fun.. like it used to be.. before they added the "three strikes and your out" annoyance.  Once you're through, and have cracked the game using the pre-determined scores and music, open it up.. Let people play whatever.. like Audiosurf..   Add a *POINT* to the game.. you're a spy, trying to scan for agents.. or you're trying to find someone.. any point to "scanning" would be good, rather than just point scoring...\n\nTo be honest, I couldn't be bothered with this new version.  It's a real shame because Dejobaan have clearly tried to salvage it from it's pre-alpha state.  Sadly, it's missed the mark a little.   I haven't got time to put all my music through this to see what makes a "fun" level, because I doubt that any of the levels are truly "fun", now that you've got the rule that "hit three things and you're dead".\n\nI have an urge to create a boring 1hr long MIDI track with a single note, and AFK-ride that note from the comfort of in front of the telly, returning to see I'd scored the highest score ever..  But it's just not worth it.\n\nI still can't give this a thumbs-up, despite the fact it's oh-so-close to being awesome.  Sorry, Dejobaan.","January 25, 2015","false","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So now the game goes from a full retail game and gets put into "Early Access". I'm still not really sure how it's even legal to sell an incomplete game and have it slip past and get thrown on the Steam store to make money.\n\nThe game has gotten a complete makeover and went from a game about playing music and falling through a stage collecting a score and shooting...well...nothing, you see they gave you a gun to shoot stuff but because it was never finished there was nothing to shoot. The gun has since been removed and now the game is nothing more than a screen saver that plays your music.\n\nNow the whole point of the game is to fly through a stage and get as close to an object to gain a score but you need to avoid making any kind of contact with it or you get hit, but don't worry because you can't die... I'm not really sure the developers even know what they want the game to be or what they're trying to go for. Any other music driven game knows what it wants to do and it does it well, this game on the other hand doesn't and in fact if you really wanted you could load up a song and just let go of the mouse and the level will complete itself with no assistance needed.\n\nIf you want a game with absolutely no objective and no real reason to exist then this is the game for you, but if you actually want a game for your money then avoid this game at all costs.","November 26, 2013","false","1.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

(It's been roughly 2 years now, I think)\n\nAnd that may explain why I felt the way I did during the x amount of time I spent on it to get the cards. The game is fun, but it feels like it's missing something. For one thing, it needs some kind of indicator to show what unlocks the next city (unless I'm an idiot and just missed it), because I have no idea how. The first few cities unlocked after doing the prior city once, and then when I hit city 5, the next one didn't unlock, and I was like "huh?". After doing it 2 more times, it did, but I have no idea what I did differently.\n\nThen, the core of the gameplay itself feels like it's just lacking something in general. As far as I could tell, it's impossible to fail. You just fly through the city, avoiding the blocks. You use your mouse to move, and left/right click to rotate yourself. And that's... about it. At this point, it's more like a little stress reliever than an actual game.\n\nI'd say it's worth picking up if it goes on sale to $2 or $3, but not any higher, but for now I'll remain optimistic that, in time, it'll be super duper awesome.","August 19, 2013","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alantryth/recommended/15540/","alantryth","Alan Tryth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alantryth/","553 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThere's something about this series that I find strangely relaxing; soaring through the sky, twirling around buildings ... similar to Mirror's Edge in feel, in that there is a genuine feeling of height and falling that is just oddly cathartic to me. I'd love to see this incorporated in another game; perhaps a way to make fast travel feel less like point and click and more like travelling fantastical distances (I've always felt like my character in Bethesda Games is doing a Megaman-esque beam up whenever I fast travel). This installment brings with it full mouse control, which I find to be very tight and easy to master, the ability to use your own tracks on some levels (Yes, I used Megalovania and Arachnophilia), and an interesting character in Asumi.\n\nThat said, this game has been in Early Access for quite a while, and I think I know why. As much as I like this, it does feel very much the same, and I think the developers know that and are trying to find new ways to mix up the formula. Now, I for one don't mind more of the same; I've already run through all the levels on the other games and like the idea of using my own music to mix things up again (Hopes and Dreams, people). If I had to throw in a criticism, though, the levels where I could use my own music didn't have as much level variety as I would've liked. I also echo the same sentiment as many; a free-fall option where you aren't stopped after three hits would be nice.\n\nSo do I recommend this?  I'm gonna go with a very tenative yes, with a suggestion that you pick up one of the others first if you're a prospective new player and wait and see if the project has truly been abandoned before putting more than a dollar of your money up for this title in particular. I sincerely hope this isn't the case; with VR already descending on the video game industry, this (along with the previous games) is one of the titles that makes me want to plunk down the cash to see where Asumi's story takes her.","May 11","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you liked AaaAAaa!!! and you like music games, it's definitely worth checking out.","June 11, 2013","true","1.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","3"

Which is fantastic for one-handed gamers (A rather overlooked market frankly.)\n\nThe big difference between this and the previous base jumping entries from Dejobaaaaaaaaaaaan however is that you can (now, not in the future, you can do it now.) use your own Mp3 tracks to generate levels.\n\nThis is still early access however, so don't expect things to be perfect and realise there is no guarantee of a final polished product. But 1... 2... 3.. for the game it is NOW not the game you may get later.","October 12, 2014","true","9.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","1"
