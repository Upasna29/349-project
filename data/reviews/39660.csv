"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ecent/recommended/39660/","ecent","^2 ecentrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ecent/","144 products in account","A game with a fantastic concept that was very poorly executed, full of bugs and extremely difficult.\n\nThe game remains largely unpatched since release for most of the inherent problems.\n\nThis is a family dynasty simulator in which you economically grow your family via businesses and diplomatic relations within your townships. You can take office in local parliament, ultimately running the town (this is extremely, extremely difficult to even get close to this). You run business' of various trades, IE a Pub or a Blacksmith, you find a woman to marry, and have children with her, growing your clan and ability to pick up new business through your children (once they are controllable and at apprentice age).\n\nThe Guild II has a relatively steep learning curve, and really is a good example of a difficult rts/rpg from early 00's.\n\nThe Guild II has a nice consistent fantasy middle age art style and it would be nice to see the game remade in the modern day in working order for its conceptual ideas and simply the fact that nothing really like it has come out since.","June 8, 2014","true","95.6"," 57 of 66 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","57","66","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdwardisFail/recommended/39660/","EdwardisFail","Í₫ĽΈ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdwardisFail/","338 products in account","Have you ever wondered what it would have been like to try and make your way in a world of corruption, religious intolerance, violence, hatred, greed and injustice? Well look no further, the Guild 2 offers you a chance to carefully weasel your way to the top of the food chain via sabotage or bribery, blackmail or brute force.\nThe Guild 2 offers a variety of settings for you to play the game. The year starts in 1400 in a variety of famous French, German, Danish & Austrian cities. The Pirates of the European Seas adds the larger maps of London, Denmark, Holland,  Southern Sweden stretching to western Germany. This is because of the addition of sailable ships which can be used for either fishing, exploration or piracy. Before you start a game, you have to choose the rules. There is a difficulty slider, it only effects how much money you start off with, I put it on easy because you start off with 10,000 gold. There's also multiple game types you can choose from, eliminating your enemies, rising to power, gaining wealth or just free mode.\nAfter that you choose your emblem and then character creation. You only have the option to create one playable character. Gender is important in the sense that if you choose to play as a woman you will be incapacitated during pregnancy. However once you marry, you play as your spouse. Making a family is important for your dynasty's survival. There are four classes available and you cannot change them in game. Scholars, Rogues, Craftsmen & Patrons,\nEach class has a variety of buildings they're allowed to build and purchase. There are level requirements to upgrade your buildings, however gaining experience is done easily by going through stages of life. (marriage, children, politics)\n\nOverall I would rate the general gameplay extremely enjoyable, on the highest settings this game looks very pretty despite its poor choice in character quality and design. If it were more realistic looking, this game would be fantastic.\nThere are also serious game breaking glitches, including pathfinding problems for the handcarts that transport your important products to be sold at the market.\n\nTL;DR:\n- This is a Medieval jerk simulator.\n\n- Having a wife & kids is important, you age faster than you'd expect.\n\n- There's four classes, each with respective roles in medieval society. With the Pirates of the European Seas, you can fish and also attack trading ships.\n\n- There's various ways to lose, the most obvious is by death, you can also be in debt for two seasons in a row and will be exiled.\n\n- The politics of the game allow you to dispatch your rivals in a variety of unique ways.\n\n- Finally, the glitches. The Guild 2 has multiple glitches despite the fact that it is aged they will probably have no fixes.","June 1, 2015","true","28.5"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

The piracy features also allow you a lot of new options in the opposite direction as you can now corner markets by denying access to certain raw goods in a specific city.\n\nThe developers also took great note of the community feedback and while Pirates of the European Seas is hardly bug free it is a great step forwards from the main game.\n\nPirates of the European Seas is a good solid expansion to an already entertaining concept and definitely worth a purchase if you liked The Guild II. It does however still suffer from poor AI and a somewhat broken economy.","January 14, 2013","true","136.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

The Guild II - Pirates of the European Seas is essentially Guild 2 but with a bit more improvements applied over it which make it feel a bit fresh. The game is actually pretty good (not the best out there) but certainly among the better of the titles that attempted to emulate this genre!.\nThere a some certain hilarious bugs (mostly not game breaking though) but hey, it's the Guild 2, those things are what make the game much more fun!.\nHighly recommended to kill some time and carve out a dynasty that can stand the test of time :P","November 7, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, it does have less options for customizing yoour character, but no big-e.  Just like The Guild 2: Renaissance:\n1.  Pick a Map.\n2.  Pick Your Faction...and yes, it still isn't really that clear who's sheild is who's.\n3.  Pick Your Mission...I believe they are still the same as The Guild 2: Renaissance.\n4.  Customize Your Character...again, yes, customizing your character has less look wise, but everything else is pretty much the same.\n5.  Click on Start and You are In The Game.\nUsually, I go for The Mission of Becoming Mayor.  In this Add-on, you don't have to bribe everyone before the Election starts.  You wait until the voting.  When the Mayor has called what you've been elected to you have a time slot to Bribe, Compliment, and Begile The Voters to get them to your side.  It's very easy to do.  No need to be flustered over not being able to do all of these things and not know if you'll be voted-in or not, either because of a.  The Person You Bribed Left or b.  The Person Descides to Vote for Someone Else.\nOverall, Great Game.  Even more addicting than some other Medieeval Sims...and you don't feel bad about your Creations.\nP.S.  There is also a Campgin!  :)\nNow, I think I'm going to play this some more after I hit the "Post Review" Button.","July 30, 2015","true","346.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have not experienced many of the bugs that others on here report, and have found the game to be very stable. The general difficulty is absurdly easy, I have never had under 100k after about 45 minutes of gameplay, and generally enjoy it when I can control the government with a family member in literally every position. If anyone causes trouble for you, start a trial and then just vote guilty (and since you control the government you have a family member in every jury position).\n\nYou can then buy or steal every building in town, burn down your competitors businesses and then rebuild another building in the exact same location, and hire thugs to follow your enemies around. You can poison the cities water well to generate more business for your hospitals, and you can summon demons and spirits to give you gifts. Want your own private army of super powered thugs with full plate armour that can take on the city guards? Easy! Just be the only smithy in town that only sells to your own troops.\n\nIf you want an easy game on ANY difficulty, just be in the business of raw materials of any sort, either food or wood or metal.","February 12","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
