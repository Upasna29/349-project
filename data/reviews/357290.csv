That being said, the following review addresses the game as a joke it is.\n\nMy friend got this... unholy masterpiece for me so that we all could have some fun listening to the entrancing stories told by Russkij Ivan (I assume that's the protagonist's name). Well, we did get a few laughs from that, but...\nIt gets really annoying. Even though the death of the protagonist is shown simply by displaying a hilarious text box with "you died" written on it, it is tiresome. Every time creepy UFOs or ghost cats prey on your soul, you have to restart the whole chapter. Yes, even if you have to walk for ten minutes to the point where they kill you. Granted, it gives you couple of chuckles, but not for long.\n\nSo, get this gem ONLY if you are not easily annoyed or enraged by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game mechanics.","March 29, 2015","false","2.6"," 117 of 143 people (82%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","82","117","143","23","3"

There's a start game, "about us", and exit.  Then you get in game.  Every step you take you wobble violently side to side, worse when sprinting, and I'm pretty sure it could give certain people splitting headaches.\n\nAlso, the "stamina" is almost nonexistent --- the guy is out of breath and panting like he's near death after sprinting for less than 3 seconds.\n\n\nThe first spoopy ghosty thing to appear was a cat or a dog that ran across the screen, pure white.  I don't know if it was supposed to be white, because it looked to me like a graphic model that had failed to fully load.  Other random spoops appeared in the exact same spots with each playthrough (having died several times).\n\n\nThere's no option to look down the iron sights of the gun, and there's virtually nothing to actually do, see, or interact with.  The fact that this game is even up for Early Access screams "scam", exacerbated by the broken english of the store page's "About This Game".\n\nThe game at this stage feels like it has gone through nothing resembling playtesting, and should not even be available for Early Access.\n\n\n","April 5, 2015","false","0.2"," 64 of 76 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","64","76","9","0"

Also, the interior environments need lot of works. The only thing that stands out is the forest which is not that bad for an indie game.\n\nAside from the graphics, the presentation itself has nothing positive neither. The cutscenes look so amateurish as is the voice-over.\n\nThroughout the game you will only carry a pistol. Its shooting rate is so ridiculously low that it's not even fun to use. Anyway, there's not many thing to shoot at except zombie dogs, crystal tigers and annoying crows.\n\nAgain, the worst part of the game is not the combat itself but the travelling or backtracking or whatever you call it. Chapter 5 is the most frustrating part of the game. Once you get there (if you haven't gave up before) you will know what I'm talking about.\n\nOverall, this game will only please people who already has a big collection of bad games in their Steam library. Red Lake requires lot of patience. If you don't have much experience with horrendous indie games start with some Digital Homicide Studios games (The Slaugthering Grounds, Deadly Profits).\n\nIf you want to get an idea of what the game looks like you can watch my videos playthrough by clicking on the following link :\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUcvRJfF0f8D9XveC-YP5L6NOzdoEFNmn\n\nRating :\n1.5","August 27, 2015","false","4.1"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","29","31","4","0"

First of all the animations of the dogs you first encounter are bad. I shot one, and his corpse did somersaults at my feet. In a wacky game like goat simulator that may be acceptable, but not here. When you die you respawn at a checkpoint, but the ammo you had does not respawn with you, so if you run out of bullets dying will not bring them back. There were plenty of times that the dogs were a mile away, but still managed to bite me. I would hear the barks after I died. Game is glitchy and full of bugs. When you run, the stamina meter depletes very quickly, and your character will go into an asthmatic attack. I did not make it too far, could not figure out where to go or what to do. I lost interest quick as I found the game painfully dull. A masterclass in crappy game design and execution. Not worth it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMDDTRaO8DU&index=37&list=PLNCk-m24qgLkgLn0G_PjSKus4gRPcU69J","December 11, 2015","false","0.8"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

After that you're thrown in a forested area, have to face a few dogs, read a note, nighttime suddendly comes and you're supposed to survive several dogs in a row.\n\nWell, sadly the gunplay is terrible, the pistol fires slowly and, if you want to flee as the dev suggests, your stamina bar depletes laughably fast (just like your flashlight). Did you die to the dogs after playing for 15ish mins? Well sorry but it's back to square one and you'll have to do everything again. If you're unlucky you might spawn with no bullets at all, or less bullets that intended (I personally had 18, then 18 again, then zero, then 40), or you might get stuck on a brick or on the nose of a dog and thus find yourself a metre above ground. If you're lucky though the second chapter will unlock after you die a couple times and you can enjoy trying to sneak through a zone inhabited by many instakill azure balls of energy.\n\nRed Lake simply isn't worth any kind of money nor an install if you got it from a bundle...it's simply a terrible game and its frustrating gameplay and gamebreaking bugs make it miss even the "so bad it's hilarious" category.","February 26","false","1.5"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","28","36","0","0"

At £3.99 I thought it would be fine and not a waste if it wasn't very good.\n\nThe start is faily poor, not much going on, running makes me feel ill, very little stamina but then most characters in games these days seem to suffer from asthma. The translucent cat and man on the bridge were very poor and the level of graphics for a chargable game were less than I would expect.\n\nHowever - when I look at the game as a whole, the gameplay, whether I was scared, the atmosphere created etc, it actually wasn't bad. It certainly wasn't an easy game to get through either. I spend several hours playing to get the 45 mins of edited gameplay for my channel. There were plenty of glitches but I put them to one side and carried on.\n\nMy main and final gripe with Red Lake was towards the end of the game (I assume its was near the end) when I was attacked and killed by the crows or by the silent black giant I was sent back to around half way through, so had to play another 40 mins just to get back to where I was before just to be killed again to have to replay 40 mins etc, etc....\n\nI can forgive most things and in this game I had to but to be sent back so far was just too much and I gave up in frustration in the end. I'm not sure if everyone has had this glitch or if its just me?\n\nWould I recommend this game...Yes if you didn't have to pay or if this glitch wasn't there! But as you do and it is my verdict is please don't buy it until the glitch has been sorted.\n\nWatch my video to get a taster, then its up to you.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk3b8RmSvIQ\n","April 7, 2015","false","5.0"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncageable/recommended/357290/","uncageable","Gwidhw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncageable/","679 products in account","Red Lake is...  yes.\n\n=======\n\nCONS:\n\n- Lack of intriguing story: The story is first and foremost, uninteresting. I felt bored listening to the opening monologue by the protagonist, and really don't recall why he was there in the first place. The only thing I noticed, was his voice.\n\n- Choice of voice actor: He's not bad! Don't get me wrong; he's alright. The issue is... well, did they tell him to do an accent and then just drop it all together? Or did they just mess up? Also, what accent is he supposed to have?! Is it Russian or something? I only assume because of the Russian newsprint laying around, as well as the option to play it in Russian, other than English. Either way, it's distracting.\n\n- Lack of weapons/choice of weapons: Why does he ONLY have a gun? He should really have a knife, or the use of his fists, if you run out of ammo. Losing ammo supply in this game means game-over, essentially. There really should be an additional weapon introduce, such as melee of some sort, instead of just the gun. It's not even a very good gun, either, as he has to shoot a dog in the face 5 times before it dies. Which brings me to another issue...\n\n- Enemy AI: They automatically know where you are, and how to get to you, without you knowing where they are until you see them. If you CAN see them... maybe it was an aesthetic thing, but, it just looked lazy, wherein you enter the caves and see a polygonal figure of a cat/mountain lion thing(?) that looks like it wasn't finished, textured, coloured, or anything, and was just left, with the addition of some twinkly sounds (akin to wind chimes) thrown in to make them sound like they belong that way. I'm sorry... it looks lazy. Also, the mechanic for killing the giant electro-sphere, things? Well, I don't understand at all how that works. Shooting barrels does nothing but waste ammo for an already crummy pistol.\n\n- World animation: The tree leaves and bushes look like they're jivin' to some crazy tunes, while the grass remains solid as a rock. Very distracting, and again, feels lazy.\n\n- Fighting Mechanic: It works well enough, except... when a dog attacks, how come I can stand on it's face? At one point, I had a dog standing on it's hind linds, with me balancing on it's face, shooting it. Then, another dog jumped at me, so I was standing on the face of a vertically standing dog, who was standing on the face of another vertically standing dog! I don't know if that's what goes on in Russia or not, but... that's just odd.\n\n- Landscape: Drab, unappealing, and boring. Straight up.\n\n- Lack of Menu Settings: No settings, aside from initial boot-up resolution choices, and English or Russian language before starting a game. Disappointing.\n\n- No "Save/Load" feature: Not sure if it auto-saves or what, but, I'm not willing to find out.\n\n- Lack of Scares/Scares in general: This game wasn't impressive at all, when it came to getting a fright out of me. Mostly jump scares, all of which fell flat for me, were uninteresting. A floating head or a man disappearing from sight in a jittery black smoke-type thing (that was just awkward) might have worked well in 1995, but not in 2015. At all. Nor did some giant metal barrels suddenly flinging themselves around bear any fear. Not even the floating head that just slid in through one wall, across the hallway, and into the next well. Just... no. That's, well, AN amount of effort, though, I guess.\n\n- Flashlight: Why does the flashlight only work for a set time limit before needing to recharge? No battery system, nor continuous light, just... insta-charging, over a period of a good amount of time, before using it again. That's just...  odd. No flashlights work like that unless they're manually rechargeable (winding), and this one definitely isn't that kind.\n\n\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Textures (where applied, lawl): The texture for the gun, the arm, and the foliage is well enough done. It looks good, aside from the lack of motion, and serves it purpose.\n\n+ Music/Atmosphere: The music really sets the mood for the game, and fits nicely with what the devs were trying to do. Nothing really to say here.\n\n\n=======\n\nSo, based on these findings, can I recommend "Red Lake" for purchase?\n...What do you think?\n\nSorry, devs, but this one is completely passable.\n\nThough, I won't uninstall it yet... I'm at least interested enough to find out how the barrel/electro-sphere killing mechanic is supposed to work.\n\nThen I'll uninstall it.\nGuaranteed.\n\nDon't buy this game.\nStraight up.\nYou'll regret you did, at this point.","June 10, 2015","false","0.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Teglement/recommended/357290/","Teglement","Rumham","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Teglement/","1674 products in account","I generally like to finish games before giving them a review, but damn.  This game.\n\nIt's one thing to have a game with some technical issues getting in the way of an otherwise great experience, like Deadly Premonition.  But this game is nearly impossible to progress in.  You have a laughably low fire rate with your pistol, which means you're highly unlikely to have a single encounter where you don't take damage.  This wouldn't be an issue if you actually had health kits to use, but in the short time I played, I didn't find one.  The controls are also very slippery besides that.  Movement feels like it takes place in an ice rink and aiming is a chore.\n\nThe scares are there.  But they're all jump scares with little to no thought put into them.  Things darting at you at high speed, bright flashes, all that.  The music isn't awful though.  Gotta get at least one thing (marginally) right.  I would tell you what the story is like, but by the time you get anywhere, you're at such low health that you eventually die in one hit, and most of the enemies (I only encountered dogs) don't give you any kind of indicator that they see you until they're already latched firmly onto your balls.  Also, you float up in the air when they attack you.  It's goofy.  Did I fail to mention that when you die, you go back to the beginning of the game?  Maybe there are checkpoints, but I can say from experience, they are in no way placed frequently enough.\n\nYet Red Lake is not the most lazy game I've played.  The developers do seem to actually care about the product.  They just did not deliver on making any of it refined in any sense of the word.  It's fundamentally broken.  I might revisit it with an iron gut and plow through the game just to see how it pans out and if there is anything that redeems it as a whole.\n\nGet it for cheap in a bundle if you like bad games.  But if you want it for any reason outside of the novelty, stay away.","July 5, 2015","false","0.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

The game is focused in a post apocalyptic world with unknown entities such as wild dogs which happen to look mutated, ghost-like in appearance dogs in really big caves and unknown sphere's which zap any breathing or moving object causing instant death or suffocation on the spot. The game also has very nice stealth mechanics which allow you to bypass enemies with ease but if you find yourself in a struggle for life, you can simply unload your chamber of 9mm rounds into the enemy causing internal tissue and muscle bleeding and external entry of bullet (wound). The reloading animation is some what hindered depending on your character's state which could be near death (i.e bitten by dogs or fallen off a certain height) or fully healthy (in which case it would be fast and smooth with no hesitation). You often write notes into your noteback after certain horrific events (i.e Sphere zaps multiple ghost-like dogs). You can read the latest events remembering the horror you bypassed by just clicking TAB which is the default binded key. The game also introduces a new mechanic which is masterbation! It helps with stress levels which your character has and can be increased if horrific anomalies are spotted such as a fat ghost flying across your screen. Of course, you can walk backwards and miss the whole point of this epic game but what boring person would want that?\n\nCon's: This game only features 1 type of weapon which is the standard us military sidearm (The m9 beretta) which was first manufactured in Italy. Although more than 1 weapon would be cool, I don't mind having a sidearm as it's proven as one of the most effective throughout games and history itself.  Also I have a slight complaint about the sensitivity (too fast) but any person can get used to it as long as they use it plenty of times.\n\nSummary: Realistic high quality anatomy,physics and ballistics of bullets and beautiful extraordinary graphics and gameplay, but the downside being the m9 as the only available weapon and slightly overly increased sensitivity.\n\nOver my years of gaming, I have never played a game as detailed and amazing as red lake.\n11/10.\n\nBuy it, the recent update made the game even more stable and beautiful!\n","August 2, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","2","14","0","2"

You never know what is going to happen next, and a lot of things seem unintentional, and it never plays the same.\n\nI may never need another first person shooter again.\n\nPros:\nGood graphics\nSolid gameplay\nRealistic gun mechanics\nSuper scary\n\nCons:\nThe only problem I have with this game is that I can't find a problem with it\n\n11/10","April 8, 2015","true","0.5"," 10 of 54 people (19%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","19","10","54","22","0"

Of course, the game is not without bugs, but hopefully in the future developers to fix it. Really like the sound of music, as well as to the atmosphere. Do not forget that this is his first major project (game developed only one person). So I do not feel sorry for the money spent.","March 26, 2015","true","0.5"," 18 of 149 people (12%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","12","18","149","13","0"
