There are a great number of highly questionable "synonyms".\n\nFurthermore, the display seems to have a frustrating tendency to glitch out\n\nLastly the claim that the game is narrated by Richard Dawkins is patently false as there is no narration.","September 23, 2015","false","0.1"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","32","36","0","2"

It's true that I'm not exactly english for a start, so playing an english-based word game is tricky, but it doesn't matter, really. That game fails to do what it claims to do in the first place.\n\nThe rules are simple : you're given a target word (say "Silence"), and given a starting word (say "Crash"), and a cloud of synonyms you can pick from. The goal is to get closer and closer to the target word by picking the right words from the words cloud. The thing is, there's not only synonyms in the cloud, but also antonyms, sometimes just analog terms (otherwise you wouldn't get very far)... but not always.\n\nSo for example starting with "Crash", goind towards "Silence" you could expect to go through "Crack", then "Noise" or "Sound", and then choose the antonym "Silence"... but only IF the game knows that "Silence" is an antonym of "Noise". but when you get, for exempale, to the word "Real" you can choose "Lawful"... and also "Unlawful", but can't pick "Silence" out of "Noise".\n\nAnd there you have it : this game is not about knowing your english, it's about guessing what words are linked with what other words in the game's database. And without knowing what dictionary it was built onto, there's NO WAY you could play this game properly.\n\nThis is more a data mesh exploration game than a word game. Therefore it is pretty bad. I know it's cheap, but that doesn't make it any better","March 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","32","37","0","0"

Being a mobile game at heart it's great for those pick-up-and-put-down sessions when you can't commit to something meatier. However, you may just want to pass on this PC port and simply get the mobile version as the PC version gets little in the way of love. A great example of this is when you enter your initials for a high score, you have to click the letters to cycle through the alphabet instead of simply typing them them with the keyboard. Womp-womp. At the price, this portitis can easily be overlooked.\n\nEdit: ICYMI (like me) "All profits from Synonymy got [sic] to Educational Charities, including the Richard Dawkins Foundation." and "the foundation’s mission is to realize Richard’s vision to remove the influence of religion in science education and public policy, and eliminate the stigma that surrounds atheism and non-belief."

It is an interesting concept, and can be neat to explore the word-map, but ultimately there's not much to the game - each pair is self-contained and there is no progression from challenge to challenge, so once you've gone through a single time there's not much variety (beyond the definitions in question, of course).\n\nTo someone who greatly enjoys words and reading, this might scratch an itch. But it's a very niche game without much in the way of replayability, so it is difficult to recommend to the general consumer.","July 7, 2015","false","1.2"," 33 of 44 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","33","44","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Obawan/recommended/342890/","Obawan","Obawan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Obawan/","283 products in account","Firstly, this is a mobile port to PC/Mac, so the controls are very basic keyboard & mouse click. I experienced some overlay issues within the game when I was reviewing the tutorial and wanted to interrupt it to go back to the main menu. There's no intuitive "esc" to main menu, or anything similar. This is a straight up port, so you have to "swipe" back to menus through the arrow or AWSD keys.\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite simple to pick up: you start with a word, given the definitions, and set off with a completely unrelated word to find your way through synonym choices to get to your target word. Remember those "change one letter at a time to get from "Bear" to "Cake" type word puzzles?" This is exactly the same only with synonyms. If you click on a middle word, you are given the definition, and just randomly clicking on words may increase your vocabulary but it won't necessarily get you to your target word. With weekly challenges, and an ability to give a fellow player a code to try and compete against one another, Synonymy is a nice change of pace to other word games.\n\nGameplay isn't complicated (outside of the word-linking; puzzle-solving) but your mileage may vary with the controls. It is, after all a straight from mobile port, so you may find you prefer that interface than your PC/Mac.\n\nAs of this review, the Steam Overlay doesn't work with the game, so you can't screenshot, etc.\n\nThe game does however feature a set of 5/5 trading cards (this isn't yet referenced in the Store Page).\n\nAlso of note, is this is listed as a "non-profit" game. Proceeds from this game go to Richard Dawkins charities which are listed on the game's actual website (store page has a link) and worth a look if this sort of information is important to you.\n\nI recommend this game purely based on its educational value and change of pace gameplay. There is some longevity to it, depending on how much you like to play with words :)\n\nPick it up in a bundle or on sale.","May 30, 2015","true","1.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

The easiest difficulty usually gives you very common words, where the paths are more obvious. But on the hardest difficulty, the words start to be a little more complex, not so common, making it challenging for older people. Since you can see the definition of every single word it's a very educational game - even for adults - you may learn a word or two that you didn't know before, specially on the harder difficulty settings.\n\nYou probably won't play this game for hours and hours in a row but rather on short bursts of time several times.\n\nThe game also features "seeds" (or pass-codes), a 5 character code that you and your friends can enter on the beginning of the game to ensure you have the same starting word and goal. That way you can compare your scores at the end.\nThere's also a global leaderboard, where you can see the the score, starting and goal words of the most recently played games around the world, along with its pass-code in case you want to try the same challenge by yourself.\n\nI absolutely recommend it.

Indeed, it is a good reason to communicate through learning and playing, and I'd like to see this game translated in other languages, as it's planned, to make its educational value even bigger, going beyond the English-speaking world.

No full screen mode, no settings, incredibly annoying audio, and the display doesn't even render at the correct aspect ratio unless you manually tweak the window to exactly the right size.\n\nThe window popped up mostly off the screen, and it was too large for my 1080p display.

Clicking around left me very frustrated as there's a long & terribly annoying noise that plays every time you click something.

Try to find a chain of synonyms that connect two dissimilar words.\n\nNegatives/Gripes:\nIt's come to my attention that any profit goes to a specific charity you may not want to support. Given how less than forthcoming the store page is with this information, that's incredibly bad. For this reason and this reason alone I cannot in good conscious give this game any favorable recommendation.\n\nThis is a game you can play by yourself if you have a thesaurus and the will to challenge yourself or someone else to chain together any two words of your choice. Why does this need to be electronic, other than the fact that most people don't own a thesaurus? Give us something, developer. (I am aware of the scores, challenges, etc? - but I do not acknowledge these as things of value to most people)\n\nStore page claims "narrated" by some guy. That might apply to the TRAILER, but I have yet to hear one word of narration in game.\n\nLaunches in a window as large as my screen, but off-center such that I can't see everything. Can maximize the window but the bottom is still behind the taskbar unless I change my taskbar settings for this one game. No options to my knowledge for changing screen size to something more convenient - not even true full screen.\n\nSomething unpleasant happend the first time I tried to open the menus - the instruction text remained, as if on a bottom layer, and every menu text in historical order layered on top, AFTER I had resumed the game. The result was an impossible-to-read/play eye-sore. Closed the game and had to restart (avoiding menus from now on after I start a game).\n\nSeems primarily designed for touch devices and is minimalistic in many ways. Lack of controls and conveniences that should be simple enough for a mouse/keyboard make for an unneccessarily punishing, redundant, and not-very "educational" experience. Sure, you can see definitions for the word that is your final objective before you start, but that's it. I didn't see much opportunity to learn anything in this game. It's no more educational than any dictionary.\n\nExample of what I mean:\nWhen you pick a synonym, the previous word is usually listed on the first page. Instead of being able to "undo" a word and try a different synonym, the game just keeps adding your choices together. So when you finally complete the "word chain" you can end up with the exact same word appearing several times. For a game that automatically posts every word chain completed to the web, I would have thought it respectful to anyone following those posts if the game bothered to post only the most direct path - NOT every single redundant instance of someone fumbling around in search of the end.","March 6, 2015","false","1.8"," 16 of 38 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","16","38","0","6"

I love the concept of taking two totally unrelated words and connecting them through synonyms. Unfortunately, that idea isn't executed as thoroughly as it could (and maybe should) be. What I mean is when you're choosing synonyms, you only have a handful of choices, rather than the entire gamut of synonyms for a particular word. I can only think this was done to make the game simpler, but why would a game dev ever think that'd be a good idea? Laziness? Pretension? Who knows!\nThis game is already niche, so cater to it & make it complex! ALAS!\n\nTHAT SAID... Synonymy is a fun little brain game, especially if you're a language person, & especially if it's on sale, but don't expect too much.","October 15, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
