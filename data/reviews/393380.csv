There came an awkward silence for a brief moment as we already knew we had no time to resupply, our rifleman made a snarky comment about how we'll catch the enemy with their pants down anyways, we all laughed as together we felt invincible, so onward we marched.\n\nThere we were, a band of brothers, making our way to the last known location of squad 2 when we passed through a small town, we heared explosions not far from us, we were getting hesitent, our RPG man said quietly over local chat that he had a bad feeling about our situation, not even a moment later did the crack of a bullet wizz past my ears as I dived down, scrambiling back to my stance I saw our machine gunner down on the ground, bleeding out as he screamed for his mother over local chat, our sniper started to tell him to shut up since the enemy could hear us but his statement was cut short as he was hit directly by an RPG, we popped smoke and stopped the machine gunner's bleeding, for the next 5 minutes we spent dug in a house fighting for our lives, for the brother beside us, soon we ran out of ammo, it was over, there was nothing more we could do. Our rifleman was the first to go AWAL, in a fit of fear he dashed out of the house screaming "LATER" it wasn't even a moment later that he met the bullet. I stepped outside to see if I could reach him only to get hit myself and fall down, my squad leader screamed in a fit of horror as he ran over to me to stop my bleeding with his last field dressing, that was when our machine gunner, the new guy, stepped out of the house and opened fire without any care for his well being while screaming "COME ON, TAKE ME YOU FILTHY REBELS" as he slowly moved forward spraying down the enemy from the hills with his LMG only to hear a single crack and he fell for the last time and said he did his best. By this time I was not bleeding but could not get up without real medical attention, the only one left, our squad leader looked out into the distance then back at me and said "I'm sorry I got you all into this mess, I made a bad call, I will pay for it." He stood up and pulled out a grenade and charged the enemy who believed they killed us all, moments later I heard an explosion..I knew what the sarge did, as he payed the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nThere I was, alone.

I didn’t.\nThen the game ended.\nUndeterred I picked a new server and got ready to roll into the game with guns blazing.\nTwenty minutes later, I still hadn’t managed to shoot a single insurgent.\nIt took me a full 45 minutes to get my first confirmed kill.\n\nThe first half an hour in Squad was awful, the HUD wasn’t intuitive, and I had no idea what the point of the game was.\n\nThe next hour was filled with short and intense firefights, slow and steady progress and some of the best teamplay that I’ve ever experienced.  Squad’s gameplay bursts to life once you start actively participating in your squad and communicating with your team members.  Each kill you achieve brings you one step closer to victory, and every death you experience cripples your squad.  Squad is an immersive and realistic experience, filled with tense moments, bitter defeat and sweet victory.\n\nOne of my most memorable moments in the game occurred about halfway into the match.  We had just managed to capture the Market and parts of squad 1 were with us(squad 2).  After an incredibly tense firefight, we had finally managed to take down the insurgents and were stationed in a defensive position, looking out towards no man's land, on the lookout for the opposing team.  One of the cool features of Squad is proximity communication, in other words you can push-to-talk and those that are near you will be able to hear what you have to say, with the voice getting quiter the further away you are from the speaker.  One of the members in squad 1 activated his proximity communication, and started talking to us about a firefight that he had experienced the other day.  What happened next was a couple minutes of players, sitting in a circle swapping war stories as if they were old soldiers.  It was an incredibly rewarding and organic experience....until we got way too distracted swapping war stories, and got overrun by the insurgents.\n\nIn CS:GO are punctuated by a bursts of activity, gunplay and death, Squad’s gameplay is much more of a slow and steady burn.  At its core, Squad is a game that revolves heavily around teamwork and being able to communicate effectively with the rest of your squad.  Communication with your squad and your team is especially important and the game allows you a multitude of ways for you to communicate with your squad, your team, and those in your direct proximity.  You’ll need to work together with your squad in order to capture and control each base.  This will require large amounts of teamwork and for you to have complete trust in your squad to watch your back.\n\nThe gameplay in Squad is deadly, with death occurring quickly and oftentimes unexpectedly.  You'll run and duck as a shower of bullet peppers the wall behind you, grip your gun tightly as tracer rounds fly above your heads and breathe a sigh of relief when your squad rounds a corner in order to back you up.\n","January 6","true","17.0"," 699 of 748 people (93%) found this review helpful 110 people found this review funny","93","699","748","110","15"

I place down a rally point for a respawn for my guys, we hold our position for at least 10 minutes fighting off countless enemies from all around.

An RPG shell had just impacted the ground in front of me showering my squad in dust and debri. An eerie silence follwed only to be cut by the unmistakable murmurs of 'medic' crackling over my headset. To my right, I saw our medic inch forward not 6ft feet from me, only be ge riddled with bullets from a hidden AK-47 toting insurgent. Of the 9 man team I had been apart of, 4 lay dead and the rest including myself were disorientated and frozen in place as the pitter patter of steps grew louder. Here I was, on the edge of a poppy field, amongst my enemy with my dead squad mates lying beside me. I've never experienced survivor's guilt in a video game but in that moment, I felt it. In the course of 20 minutes, I'd laughed and sworn with my now deceased squadmates and for some reason, perhaps through divine intervention I had been spared. Through all this time it never occurred to me that I could respawn if I were to be killed such was the immersion of the moment. 'Squad' is the greatest modern warfare tactical FPS I've ever played as it breathes life into a genre that was becoming all to stale with nothing but the ARMA series to counter such an accusation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CanadianBacon92/recommended/393380/","CanadianBacon92","CyberMage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CanadianBacon92/","331 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you don't trust Early Access titles, then this game may change your mind. I can honestly say that I have NEVER in my time playing Early Access games, seen a developer team that works so closely with the community, and even comes on the servers and plays with every one and asks questions and makes sure that the communities voice has been heard. But to get down to an actual review of the game, here goes.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay for it being an alpha early access game is PHENOMENAL, the firefights that you get into are intense, and really get your blood flowing. The game is so well designed that from the standpoint of gameplay, you actually gain a sense of fear before assaulting a compound, or hearing footsteps outside a wall unsure if it is a friendly or not, and being unwilling to check your map for fear of potentially getting shot. The in-game comms are very well done, Local positional voice, Squad voice, and Squad leader voice (For SLs talking amongst other squads). The medical system is an ever changing system, but it is also a system that works, and it works damn well. The weapon handling is fantastic, it really emphasizes not blasting full auto, unless of course you are in a CQB situation then it works perfectly fine. Fob building is great as well, clear images of what is going to be there once it has been built by squadmates, and what direction it faces. Overall, coming from Project Reality myself, the gameplay for Squad gets a solid 10/10 from me.\n\nAUDIO\nHonestly, I have never heard a military shooter with such crisp audio. From the footsteps of friendly and enemy soldiers, to the supersonic crack of a bullet flying passed your head. Nothing in my opinion beats Squads audio team and I really commend them for doing all the research they can to get the sounds as close to what they are in real life. The weapon sounds are crisp, clear, and sound powerful. Not like other games where they sound like peashooters. The death screams are a nice touch, and help with identifying allies that have gone down and need a medic and confirming kills. The music score in the main menu is also phenomenal, it really brings to life the thought of being sent to a warzone and not knowing if your squad is going to make it, although the music isn't featured in the actual gameplay, it's a welcome and very well done touch to the main menu.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe graphics are a huge step-up from Project Reality. I've played games like Arma 3/2 and before that, I've also played the entire battlefield series (but stuck with BF2), and countless other games that are very intense when it comes to graphics. Squads graphics in some aspects are some of the best I have seen. From the backblast of an RPG or LAW, to the actual explosion of hand grenades, 40mm grenades, or the warheads from the LAW/RPG they are fantastic to watch and truly a sight to see, and gives a sense of danger when you see this huge cloud of smoke land just feet away from you as you are taking cover behind a wall waiting for your moment to break cover and return fire. The player models are always being updated, with the new Russian, Militia, and the Insurgent factions getting a welcome makeover since I started playing in September. The Americans are due for a makeover as well, but this will come in due time.\n\nCONTROLS\nUnlike the Arma series, Squad doesn't feel even close to as clunky as arma, but offers the same range of movement(Save for free look which is a possibility in the future). It offers a rich and rewarding movement system that causes you to think before you make an action as the momentum of your soldier is what propels you towards the direction you are facing, unlike games like Battlefield 2/3/4 where it feels like you're constantly sliding around with a constant momentum in either direction where you can turn on a dime and get a headshot. Squad isn't a milsim, but it also isn't a twitch shooter, and it really finds it's balance by bringing the two together and taking the good parts from both, while getting rid of the bad parts as well as incorporating a lot of the phenomenal things that Project Reality has done.\n\nTEAMPLAY\nI'm going to say it simple, and blunt. If you DON'T communicate with your squad/team, you WILL fail. I play in a highly organized clan where we are all comfortable with each other, and understand each other. We know what is expected of us from our Squad Leaders, and the #1 thing that you can, and have to do to be successful, is LISTEN to your squad leader and COMMUNICATE what is going on around you. Giving valuable information such as enemy movement in a certain direction (0 to 345, 0 being 360), letting your squad leader know when you have stumbled upon an enemy FOB, or even letting the medics know you've been tagged and need medical attention. I cannot stress enough how valuable communication and teamwork is in this game, working as an effective squad where that squad is helping the team will make or break your experience.\n\n\nAll in all, I recommend squad 110% the game took my breath away from the moment I stepped on the sandy hills of Logar pressing through hostile fire coming from the central village, or stepped into the deep desert valley of Kohat. Now with the addition of Fool's Road, I can add the intensity it was when we had three squads all communicating together storming up the side of a steep hill, to overtake an enemy FOB and release the capture point from their possession. If you pass up the opportunity to buy and play this game, I guarantee that you will regret it, Squad has been the best money I have spent on a game in a long time and I couldn't be happier. To give you some perspective on what I mean by teamwork, here is a link to a video I recorded tonight (2015-12-14) that should shed some light on what it's like to really play as a team.\n\nThe game takes time to learn. There are bugs yes, but the game is still in early development and the developers are very active in the community and do their best to fix every bug they can find before the next build update. With regards to the learning curve, it's not as steep as Armas learning curve, and it's designed so that the average FPS player can hop in and start playing basically. But, there are still concepts that are not present in other FPS games, like listening to your squad leader and doing what he says, building FOBs, taking defensive positions etc. The game isn't about rushing in and trying to get the most kills, it's about playing as a team, moving as a team, and making sure everyone is ready in your squad before moving in to attack.\n\nThere aren't any bugs in the game that are gamebreaking, AMD users have a bit of trouble playing, but that's not completely on the devs side, that has to do with Unreal Engine 4 not really liking AMD processors and graphics cards. I myself have a Core i5-3570k and a GTX 970 and I usually get between 40 and 50 fps right now while recording video. To end the final edit on this review, the game is great, it's still in alpha and being developed by only 30 people, now for 30 people to do something like this, it's amazing. When you get a company like EA/DiCE who have hundreds of developers at their disposal, and they still turn out a bad game (E.g. Battlefront, Battlefield 4, Battlefield Hardline etc) or Treyarch/activision (Call of duty games = same thing every year no real ingenuity) then what exactly are those devs doing to make sure they put out a good game? Anyways, YMMV with this game, but it's up to the individual to decide whether or not this is the game for them.\n\nI chose to replace the original video with one that shows what you will see more of in Squad. This is what you will experience 95% of the time while playing. Or at least what I have experienced 95% of the time while playing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2XIwzzjOTk","December 15, 2015","true","112.1"," 844 of 937 people (90%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","90","844","937","36","57"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrytigerp/recommended/393380/","angrytigerp","Angrytiger [USN IRL]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrytigerp/","738 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWelcome to Squad: A tactical (but not too tactical) milsim (but not too sim...-ish) designed (I'm guessing) for people who would love to play ARMA, but get turned off by the, you know, not-user-friendly controls and interface. I have NOT played Project Reality, everyone keeps saying OH IT'S BASICALLY THAT BUT BETTER – sorry, I can't offer insight on that connection.\n\nAnyways, I'll make this quick and clean because I've got tacticool stuff to do.\n\nTHINGS SQUAD DOESN'T OFFER/DO:\nVariety by design -- Squad, especially in the current form, is bereft of many of the familiar things that most FPS players look forward to -- a dozen unlockable, customizeable weapons per 'class', gizmos and gadgets to use on the battlefield, a magical radar/motion detector, etc. Even ARMA has more on it with (in certain missions/maps/gametypes) a variety of weapons to choose -- not with Squad! You can be the squad leader, a medic, ONE of up to THREE support roles (grenadier, sniper, LMG guy, etc.), or a generic rifle guy. That's it. Your kit is determined by your role. Protip: You won't always get the sniper rifle, and also your character is not a Delta Force Recon Navy Seal commando, so even when you get one it handles... well, actually, just fine, but high-speed players used to CoD, or even Battlefield, will find it boring.\n\nConstant Action – Most of the game is spent running around from one place to another, re-positioning for another engagement that will last maybe 30 seconds. While, in certain off chances, you may spawn at, say, a forward spawn point that JUST HAPPENS to be in a point that JUST HAPPENS to be getting assaulted by the enemy army, realistically most of the time you'll be watching the hills, taking potshots if you see someone, knowing that you're one observant enemy sniper/DMR/eagle-eyed rifleman away from being popped. Oh, yeah:\n\nPrioritization of gameplay over realism – you'll fall to the deck within a few hits, and even if you don't get killed you can and will bleed out. You will not be able to hold a weapon on target when firing fully automatic. You will get injured (I like to think of it as spraining your ankle) if you fall off something that's about your body height or taller. (People like to ♥♥♥♥♥ about this being unrealistic – have you ever humped around a full combat load while running around [I have.]? Do you really think you can just jump down 6 feet onto uneven ground without serious risk of hurting yourself when you're loaded down with gear?) This game takes some things to extremes, but then is surprisingly gentle about it (If you have a medic nearby, he can patch up your bullet holes and heal you completely!)\n\n”Lone Wolf” Gameplay – This is not to demean this 'style', but Squad is most definitely against the lone wolf/camper/”guys I'm gonna take the sniper rifle and 'scout'” school of gameplay. As mentioned above, you are squishy as a particularly well-worn dog toy; you'll be fighting your own [character's] body's limits most of the time when trying to frag tangos (not to mention as soon as you open up, you'll probably be spotted and lit the hell up by the enemy army); and, oh yes, a brilliant move on the devs' part means YOU CAN NOT HAVE SPECIALTY GEAR/KITS (including sniper rifles/DMRs, grenade launchers, RPGs, etc.) WITHOUT HAVING A SQUAD WITH OTHER MEMBERS. Role availability “populates” as your squad grows in size up to the maximum of 9. Now, you can TRY to be that piece of human waste that joins some random squad, takes their SR, then runs off on your own, but if your erstwhile squad is wise they'll just abandon you in your now pseudo-squad, you'll lose your SR the next time you respawn, and you'll have bad juju in the Squad community. PERFECT SEGUE!THINGS SQUAD DOES OFFER/DO:\n(As of this review) Great Community – I don't know if it's just the fact that most everyone playing this game drank the same koolaid by committing to a game based on the party line “THIS GAME'S COMMUNITY IS AWESOME!” or what, but the playerbase is fairly mature. Maybe it's the fact that you MUST work together with your squad to work well (not to mention to get all available equipment options), but everyone seems perfectly willing to follow along with what the squad leader recommends. It's just a natural inclination. And sometimes YOU'LL get sick of waiting for people to build squads and make your own, and people will join with the intention of following YOUR orders (unless you're totally incompetent).\n\nKind of a negative, too, but: Player Immersion – your mileage may vary. Tactical chatter has sort of 'infected' everyone in this game, probably descending from the actually-been-there guys, and it'll probably get to you, too. Now, this can go badly for you, as you may have guys who are SO intensely desirous to be a cool tactical milsimmer that they inject every bit of milspeak they can into their sentences, some actually used IRL, some not so much, some butchered by bad movies giving the wrong impressions – heck, they annoy me, too. But you just sort of tune them out.\n\nPromise of Growth – As I said, the game is barebones as hell at the moment. BUT... devs have been apparently delivering on their promises (so the community seems to agree) so far, and promised for the future are more weapon types, more vehicles (in the sense that any number > 0 ), more maps, etc. etc. And hopefully it won't require a $60 pre-purchase subscription bundle pack expansion season pass [zing].\nMaybe the community will grow toxic as this game goes more mainstream (Call that the "Day Z" scenario). Maybe the devs will give up on it. Maybe everyone will just drift away from it due to its lack of flashy graphics and attention-span-sating unlocks and ranks and stat tracking popping up every 10 seconds. But for now... Squad is the superlative 'deep-thinking' FPS that doesn't have a very high barrier of entry, but also requires players to play it more... intensely than Battlefield.","April 15","true","30.9"," 218 of 228 people (96%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","96","218","228","20","0"

The game seems great, well it is.. but when you think about how little is currently in the game, I very much do not believe for the $40 price tag that it is worth that amount in it's current stage. I believe later on when there is a lot more features that it will be worth it, but in my honest opionion I believe that you shouldn't get it right now. Especially with not even being able to do basic things, such as climbing over a wall, even sometimes a small bump can cause quite the annoyance. On top of that, the game is not yet very well optimised. So maybe buy it, play for an hour, and then you can always just get a refund. Because what you do in that hour is pretty all there is to the game in it's current stage. Don't get me wrong, I still do think that it is a great game, but there is just not yet enough in it to keep you playing but once the game is done however I think it will truely be amazing but until then, buy with care and have a good day guys! (And be sure to read my review below as it makes many other great points).\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nAn absolutely amazing game! I can not wait for the release of vehicles! :D\n\nRating:\n\nSOUND - 10/10 - The sound design is most definitely one of the best to date.\n\nGAMPLAY - 8/10 - The gamplay can be a bit iffy at times, but with time I most definetly believe it will be one of the most immersive and realistic shooters yet. The teamplay in this game is incredible, just by jumping into a random squad filled with strangers, we all very quickly learnt to trust each other and put the our lives into the trust of our squad leader. There have also been a lot of cheaters but server admins are doing a great job of dispatching of them very quickly.\n\nTECHNICAL - 6/1O - The game runs quite well for me. I have the GTX 760 and I can run the game on the highest settings with at least 35 fps + in the most heated of battles. A key reasoning as to why I rated it a 6/10 due to the fact that if you have AMD, DO NOT get this game as of right now, until the issues have been fixed.\n\nStory Time!:\nI went into this thinking that it was just a game, but within moments that viewpoint forever changed.\n\nAll 3 main squads ran up atop a hill and crouched down, the 3 squadleaders all came together and quickly discussed how we should proceed to attack the enemy, it was decided that Squad 1 would capture the first objective and then Squad 2 would charge the 2nd and Squad 3 (my one) would assault Objective 2 by going for a flank. After a few minutes of wandering the forest in a line formation of 9 men, many gun shots and explosions could be heard coming from the 2nd Objective, we even saw a few terrorists running past but we were given strict orders to not fire due to the risk of our cover being blown. Suddenly an enemy ran straight into us, giving us no choice but to fire, we quickly dispatched of him but in doing so we alerted the rest of the terrorist forces. Within mere moments a rocket hit the front of our squad, wiping out our squad leader as well as 3 other soldiers. Damaged by the shrapnel of the blast I crawl back to the cover of a large rock and apply bandages to my wounds, the medic beside me attempts to run over and revive the squad leader but gets popped in the side of the head from a well placed shot by an enemy sniper. Lying there, bleeding out, watching what was just moments ago an entire squad, getting wiped out in just seconds by the quickly surrounding enemy forces. the last remaining four of us throw smokes in every direction in search of a way out, an oppening, just some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to escape the hell hole. Atop of the hill a large number of terrorists can be seen running down, in a desperate attempt to get an oppening I pull out my Rocket Launcher and run out into the open drawing the fire of the opposing forces, I get hit, fire my rocket and wipe out many terrorists with 1 well placed rocket, now back in cover I attempted to reload but due to the severity of my wounds, I collapsed, bleeding out and dying beside the corpses of my fallen comrades. As I was lying there, all that could be heard were the all too realistic sounds of explosions and cracks of bullets as well as the cries and groans of the few remaining men getting hit by those very same bullets and explosives. It was at that very moment when everything changed... Was I really playing just a game? It felt all too real... Oh god, what have I done!?\n\n7/10 Would get PTSD again!","January 3","true","6.6"," 264 of 294 people (90%) found this review helpful 95 people found this review funny","90","264","294","95","26"

There are constantly new objectives based on how each squad leader reacts to different situations. This sets a foundation for a truly dynamic gameplay experience.\nThere are three channels of communication.\n-Squad leader to all squad leaders.\n-Squad radio.\n-And local voice that has a 20 metre range where volume decreases the further you are away from each other.\n\nThe visuals are very impressive for the sheer scale of the maps and the modelling/texturing of characters and objects are of a very high standard. I have managed to find a happy medium where I achieve a fairly steady 60 fps at the cost of over 3500mb of vram.\nThe explosions and smoke effects are very well done but can impact framerate in some situations. But that's really not worth moaning about, for me at least.\n\nThe sound in this game is unbelievably breathtaking and really forces you to fully immerse yourself deep into fight.\n\nThe guns are to be mastered, but once mastered become an extension of you as you lean around corners checking your sectors and controlling your recoil.\n\nThe community is absolutely brilliant. You will find really cool people from all around the world. I've lost count how many new friends I have made and I only got this game 4 days ago.\nSometimes you may find someone teamkilling but very very rarely and sometimes you will join a squad where the squad leader has no clue whatsoever.\nIf you do find a squad leader like this then you can either help this poor soul out with some encouragement or quickly join a better squad with just a couple of clicks of the mouse and hopefully with a bit of luck you will end up with a squad leader who can be considered a veteran of the game who knows their onion's. And I guarantee you that you will have a blast.\n\nIts early access so things can only get better and I am really looking forward to the future of SQUAD.\n\nAnd finally I want to thank my good friend atrOx who bought me this game as gift because he's cool like that. Thank you atrOx your a star mate  :)\n\nWant some more info then take a look here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyLrrje_wuE","January 2","true","323.1"," 154 of 169 people (91%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","91","154","169","21","15"

My squad of 9 soldiers, me included, had the task to defend the point at all cost. Defenses had been set up all around the compound to block all holes and unwanted entrances so that our chance of survival would be a bit higher. But when were cut off from the rest of our team and surrounded, we knew we wouldn’t survive. Luckily we had an ammo crate, because without, we wouldn’t have held out as long as we did. There were bullets and grenades coming towards us from every possible direction. Our defenses were slowly being dug up by the enemies. We frantically tried to fix them and patch up holes in the walls where we were being shot from. As stupid as I was, I had set up position in the second floor of the only house within a radius of a few hundred meters. Bullets were constantly hitting the walls and coming through the windows. I could barely move without bullets flying inches away from my face. The squad leader kept telling us that reinforcements were on their way, but we knew it wasn’t true. I could see with my own eyes as teammates trying to cross the river to rescue us were gunned down by the insurgent forces. We knew we wouldn’t hold out much longer. But suddenly, the gunfire almost stopped. The constant firing we had listened to for the last 20 minutes had turned into sporadic gunfire bursts. It was in this moment I decided to stand up and look through the window. I was wondering what had happened. And as I looked through the window. I saw a head pop up from behind a wall about 30 meters away. It took me a second to react, but it was too late. I heard the sound of a RPG firing. The rocket propelled grenade flew elegantly through the air as it came straight for me. My whole life flashed before my eyes. I knew this would be the end. But then suddenly my body decided to crouch down. The roar of the RPG clinged to my ears as it went over my head and through the window on the other side of the room. Shocked, I lied on the ground trying to figure out what had just happened. I came to the conclusion that God had decided to let me live another day. And as bullets again filled the air. I told my fellow very christian american army squadmates that the divine intervention that had just occurred was a sign that god was protecting us.

Features and mechanics are only a means to an end. Other shooters end up as chaotic messes, with barely any teamwork to speak of that only have boring kit unlocks and shallow, cumulative rank structures to keep you interested. Squad has more teamwork in it's loading menu than most other shooters do in their entire games, and that's on a bad day.\n\nIf the feeling of being part of a well coordinated team effort is something that you miss/desire in military shooters, buy Squad and jump into the community.

At the moment it's infantry only, nice big maps with views for miles.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/axlevice/recommended/393380/","axlevice","Axle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/axlevice/","319 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhen I played the Project Reality mod way back when it came out, I preferred BF2 over it, so I never really gave it a chance. I've come to really love realistic shooters like Red Orchestra/Rising Storm, ArmA 2/3, Insurgency, and games that require a lot of team coordination like the recent Rainbow 6: Siege or Dota2.\n\nSquad is a game that has many of those team elements, along with the brutal firefights and cheapness of life that comes with great realistic FPS games.\n\nI didn't really play Project Reality in the day, so I will review Squad without the rose-tinted glasses that many here seem to be circle-jerking about.\n\nIt has some problems running well, and anyone who says otherwise is not telling you the whole truth. On the highest settings I consistently got below 60 fps, despite the Auto Setup recommending them as well as a higher resolution than my native one, downscaled. Even after tweaking them, it still dipped below 60 fairly often, and the lowest possible settings gained me a mere 10 fps on average from my tweaked settings, likely indicating it was not a graphical problem on my end.\n\nFrom an audio standpoint, I believe Insurgency to be one of the finest examples of sound design in an FPS. Currently, I would consider Squad to be of lesser quality (keep in mind this game is still in alpha), and it could stand to gain from the signature crack of a bullet passing by you, and some other minor improvements to add to the experience.\n\nAs for the teamwork in the game, it's absolutely required to somewhat participate with your squad. I played a match where the squad leaders didn't communicate with eachother or their squad members, and we got wiped out with a nearly 200 ticket advantage (we lost 300 guys while they only lost 120ish). You see similar stomps in Insurgency or Red Orchestra as well when there is no team coordination and I absolutely love that aspect of Squad, mostly because it goes into more depth. Defending, for example, can be bolstered by building actual defenses and setting up new spawn points, which requires multiple members of a squad to participate.\n\nBut that's not to say a lone wolf can't do anything. I find its actually better to have people, especially single persons, to roam around and flank similar to Rainbow 6: Siege. Doing so in coordinated groups usually gets spotted, whereas I often found myself netting multiple kills, and on several occasions wiping out an entire squad, by going it alone. But I still needed my team to bunker down and hold a fort in order for me to do so. Thus Squad straddles the line between participating in the team when it suits you, and doing your own thing when it would benefit you more to lone wolf.\n\nCurrently my biggest complaint is that the pacing has always been slow, and it's the same complaint I had with the ArmA series. Even in extremely tense, close range scenarios, Squad progresses at a slow pace. My most adrenaline-filled moments were my flanking maneuvers with and without teammates, in order to quickly get around and attack the enemy. These moments, while certainly not dull, are nowhere near as exciting as say, CS:GO or Insurgency can be. But this doesn't detract from the fun, and for most it will have no impact at all. For me, it merely limits it. A slow drip of an addicting drug rather than a full dose, and who am I to complain about that?\n\nSquad is a great tactical shooter in its own rights. The team aspects to it are phenomenal, unlike any other shooter I've played. It lacks the performance of a game that's seen many years of development, and the polish that such a game would receive, but that is what an alpha is for. Squad has incredible potential, and while I personally would prefer to leave the vehicles out of the game (as they tend to make for slower paced games in general), I await their arrival.\n\nIf you like realistic FPSs, Squad is a must-have.","December 19, 2015","true","55.9"," 112 of 123 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","112","123","4","1"

I was pinned down today on Chora outside an enemy compound, with only myself alive and a medic who is helplessly bleeding out next to me. He stayed on coms and described where he was shot from and continued to encourage me while I fought the attacking squad. He stayed conscious long enough and didn't respawn to have a full conversation with me, just because. We reminisced on the fun times we've had on the battlefield, and the future to look forward to. Before the future came, however, his unconscious self bled out, and never in my gaming life have I felt such a pang of sorrow [except Brothers in Arms: Hells Highway. That game made me cry tears of war.].\n\nYou don't find communities that go out of their way to help each other like you do here.\n\nI'm not going to tell you every experience you will have here will be an enjoyable one. If you have a Squad Leader who doesn't know/care what he's doing, it won't be as fun.

However, if you get into a good server, a good community, a smart squad even, who works together, talks, plays for the team and not the individual... you can work together. With real people.

Also it is still in Alpha.\n\nThe Good:\n\nSquad/team mechanics - Ablsolutely love this. Rolls/weapons are limited to what you would actually find in a military unit..basically not everyone in the squad running around with light machine guns and optics (typical of arma groups).\nAlso the ability for squads to work together and coordinate attacks is just amazeballs.\nBase Building (aka minecraft) - The ability to place and build a forward operating base pretty much anywhere on the map  to attack or defend is amazing. You can build items from hesco barriers to tire walls and even bunkers. Some people have gotten extremely creative with this ^^\nMaps/Enviroment - Most of the current maps are expansive with a lot of different areas to discover. For those who have served overseas this game does a pretty good job of making you feel like you are actually over there. I know a few people who are Afghan vets that can vouche for the accuracy of content.\nThe Devs - These guys are awesome. They actually play matches with their fans and listen to what imput they have on the game to make it better.\nAmmo - For once I found a game that doesnt automatically refill ammo on used magazines. Say you have two magazines on you. You get into a fight and use 27 out of 30 rounds after which you reload. That second magazine will only have three rounds left when you reload again. Also it does not have a ammo count anywhere on your hud.. make sure you keep track or you will run out when you need it most =)\nNO THRID PERSON OR CROSSHAIR!!!! - Great for hardcore gamers!\n\nThe Bad:\n\nSound - While the sound of the weapons are close to accurate, there are currently a lot of glitches or dead spots where you lose all sound for a period of time. Also, there are delays in footsteps from your own character. (example: you are running and it sounds like your footsteps are way off behind you or in some other location. It should sound like you running not someone else)\nLevel Detail - Keep in mind this is a realism game so in order to facilitate this, they dont have as much detail as you normally would in a AAA title. That being said, the lack of objects or copy paste of certain areas does get kinda old.\nMaps - this is suppose to be a realism game but there are no elevation markers of any kind on the map =/\nWeapon balistics - little to no bullet drop, recoil is off on several weapons. (basic rifles have more kick than LMG on full auto - mind you this is in any position)\nVehicles - They have been taken out of the current build in order to make sure they are up to par with the rest of the game, however it does tend to make this feel somewhat of a walking simulator at times.\nThe Price - I do feel it is somewhat high for its current content.\nIts Alpha - falling through the map, random kicks from server - lost connection\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nIF you run AMD/ATI you will likely not be able to play this game at all or have severe gamebreaking issues if you do.\nThey know about this and are currently working on the issue - Unknown timeframe.\n\nAll in all I would rate this game (as an alpha) a 3.8 out of 5 stars.\n\nThat being said. I do recommend it if you like this style of game. Hope to see you on the battlefield soldier ^.~","December 19, 2015","true","195.3"," 87 of 90 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","87","90","5","2"

However, Squad manages to please even further. I'll break it down in a simple pros vs cons manner below.\n\nPros:\nRadio system: 3 separate radio channels. Local, squad, and command. Local is voice chat with people around you. Squad is voice chat with your squad. Squad Leaders have access to command chat with other squad leaders. The dynamic of having three separate channels allows you to communicate effectively in various scenarios. A huge plus.\nFOBs: Imagine you're playing Battlefield and you've just taken over a point in Conquest mode. Now that you've taken it you can fortify it with Hesco walls, razorwire, sandbags, bunkers, ammo resupply crates, etc. It's great.\nKit selection: There seem to be a lot of people not liking how Insurgents and Russians (so far) do not have optics. I honestly have no problem with this because the Insurgents and Russians both have access to an SVD sniper rifle with a long range optic where the US Military does not have access to this (yet). You could make the argument that it's easier to aim with the optics or even a red dot with the US Military, but I have had no problems even as the other factions.\nCons:\nMediocre Game Optimization: I'm not running a shitbox computer or anything. Far from it. I can only seem to squeeze out 50-60 fps in fullscreen with high or ultra graphics. I should think 80-100 would be feasible with my rig, but I'm hoping it's just optimization thus far. Either way this does not detract from the overall game experience to me.\nHackers: It seems like there are already a couple scripts out there that people are abusing. The main one I've seen so far is the M203 spammers that can essentially launch as many grenades as they want full auto mode across the map. It really does ruin the match. The game is in early access though so I'm not holding this against them too much.\nClipping: This is a minor gripe I have with the game. When you are prone next to a wall facing away from the wall but still against it, your feet stick through the wall on the other side and you can take damage from the other side. The easiest fix I believe would be to not allow you to put your feet through anything. So your character cannot back up so his ♥♥♥ is against the wall when he is prone and his legs are on the other side. It may suck for players to get used to, but it's how ♥♥♥♥ works in real life.\nQuality of Life Suggestions:\nUI Rework: This doesn't have to be anything fancy and crazy, but something a bit more intuitive would go a long way to assisting new players. First example I can think of right away is the Squad leader using the squad leader menu. It can be a bit daunting to look at. Grey out the things you don't have enough supply for, add help text that describes when / where / how to place items. Mark items that will need assistance building.\nOverall I would recommend trying this game out if you enjoy milsim games such as America's Army 2.8 and Arma. It's got great potential and is one of the few Early Access games I throughly enjoy playing in it's current state as of January 4th, 2016.","January 4","true","30.0"," 183 of 234 people (78%) found this review helpful 104 people found this review funny","78","183","234","104","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yeabitchmagnets/recommended/393380/","yeabitchmagnets","DC Ranger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yeabitchmagnets/","197 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(Disclaimer: This game used to not be on Steam and ran off its own launcher; thus, I have more hours on the game than what it states here.)\n\nAs the spiritual successor to Project Reality, this game surpasses the mod it was largely inspired by. The gameplay is extremely intense, and you often find yourself ambushed or getting pinned down while trying to capture one of the objectives. The suppression mechanic in this game is not overbearing like the one in Red Orchestra 2, and it adds a nice feel of urgency and stress to gunfights. If you've played Project Reality, a lot of the mechanics like healing, grenade launchers, and spawning will be very familiar.\n\nFor those that have not played Project Reality, you spawn through rally points or forward operations bases that squad leaders are able to put on the map. In addition, squad leaders can build various types of fortifications that require players to build them. Other features like grenade launchers, rocket launchers, grenades, and smoke grenades are self explanatory.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it requires coordination and teamwork to win the game. Unlike most shooters in the market, you cannot lone wolf and spawn willy-nilly unless you want to run your team's tickets down. Instead, you have to work together with your squad leaders and other squad members to be effective. Gun damage has weight, and one to three shots can end you within a moments notice.\n\nSqaud members can communicate with each other over squad radio, and sqaud leaders can communicate to each other over a sqaud leader to squad leader radio channel. All players can communicate to each other over a local voice chat as well. In addition, there is a squad, team, and global text chat players can use, but a mic is the best option when playing this game.\n\nAt the writing of this review, there are four teams: the U.S. Army, the Russian Army, a Russian militia force known as Militia, and the Insurgents, who are the game's equivalent of the Taliban. Each team has a unique array of weapons, and each weapon spawns in a different variant, whether it be its camo or variant (i.e. an AKMS when you select AKM). As of right now, there are no vehicles, but humvees, tanks, and planes are planned, as well as more factions and weapons (U.S. Marines and the M16 gun family).\n\nThe people currently playing the game (donators) have all been polite, willing to work as a team, and fun to play with. There have been only a few instances where people have been rude or unresponsive, but every game has its bad apples. To top it off, the devs are very active with the game, and I have often been in servers with them.\n\nAll in all, if you ever wanted a game that is hybrid of Project Reality, Insurgency, and ARMA, this is the game to go with. Squad is a great game, working together and killing enemies has a certain satisfcation to it, and this game will only get better as time goes by. It is one of those rare Early Access games that will fulfill the potential it has.","December 15, 2015","true","30.1"," 161 of 203 people (79%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","79","161","203","9","0"

Amid all the shouting and arguing over fantasy scores a strange thought crept into my head: somewhere on some farfetched server a soldier was lying on the ground screaming for a medic.  I could have been that medic…I could have saved that soldiers life, but instead I was just sitting there on that comfortable couch enjoying myself.  How could I have become so selfish as to have a social life after all I’d seen?  The RPG's... the frag grenades...  I knew what I needed to do.  I needed to rush home to my computer and save those soldiers, it was my duty.\n\n\n10/10 would never have a social life again, again\n","December 27, 2015","true","39.8"," 89 of 100 people (89%) found this review helpful 90 people found this review funny","89","89","100","90","5"

Even in real life I love to go shooting. I've played a lot of Arma, DayZ, Battlefield, Verdun.. You name the FPS and I bet I've played 1k hrs of it.\n\nWhat really caught me in this game, was the sounds. This game felt very familure in traveling to Arma, and DayZ.. Walking quietly through the woods, stop to take a smoke break.. hear a twig break in the trees and then all hell breaks loose after 20 minutes of strategically walking through a Forest. Nothing more caught my interest than the sounds of those bullets whizzing and crackling by my head. The sheer adrenaline I got from hearing those bullets told me my investment into this Alpha was well worth the ticket price.\n\nThe Objectives feel sort of like the Battlefield aspect of the game, with a bit of a twist. If you don't have great communication with your other Squad Leaders of what objectives to take and defend, a game can easily sway into the enemies favor. This is where communication and co-ordination is key. Knowing where to have your squad.\n\nThe Environment is beautiful. Every map puts you into the geographical immersion. From the color of the sand, to the fields of poppy, and beyond the teasing fields of sweet sweet Mary Jane. Every map is satisfying.\n\nNow, to the guns.. the guns.. oh my the friggin awesome guns. I myself have not personally shot all of the guns in this game in real life. However the guns I have shot, the guns in game.. they feel 90% real. I say 90% because the other 10 is feeling the heat, smelling the gunpowder, getting the nice bruise from holding on too tight after a few spontanious 10 round sprays, ect. Things you cannot replicate in a game. Other than that, this game has covered all realistic aspects of the weapons by far. They feel oh so sweet, oh and the best way to get an annoying squadmate to stfu.. is to lay down a good suppressive fire and suppress their useless communication with overburdened sounds of gunfire.\n\nIf you are a FPS enthusiast.. If you like feeling achieved after confirming a kill, the right way.. by walking up and making sure that enemy is dead with a swift double tap. If you have played Arma, Battlefield, Red Orchestra.. any Military style shooter. Make sure your Mic works, and get SQUAD!\n\nEDIT IN- 5/15/2016 Ok so I feel like a bit of a dummy, I've been playing Squad without even realizing it had a great history, with plenty of players who all enjoy the old version. I found out about Project Reality @ realitymod.com - I've been playing this FREE mod for a week or so now, and wow! After playing Squad and visiting Project Reality I am very excited to see the development of Squad turn into Project Reality V2!\n\nIf you really want to try out Squad, but don't want to fork out the money for EA, try out Project Reality, if you end up liking that.. Then you'll end up loving Squad by the time it is finished.\n\nWow what a game! What a Gem to find on the internet. Wish I would of known about PR a long time ago!\n\nThese are the games that put you right into the helmet. Don't miss out on it.","February 5","true","59.6"," 95 of 110 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","95","110","8","2"

I also love and still consider ARMA 3 to be one of the closest games to actual combat. I also enjoy Insurgency, and every now and then a bf4 game or too. I can play COD but I dont enjoy it or get the AWE factor I did seeing something like a building go down in BF4 or seeing 4 tanks roll by you. The audience was broad, and usually immature. I fell out of love with COD.  Now that you know my taste, if I sound similiar to you, then maybe this will help you.\n\nI have only seen 72 player servers at the moment. I have an i74790k OC'd to 4.9ghz with a GTX980 ASUS MATRIX PLATINUMN gpu. I get FPS drops but its still to high to care...That being said I have heard my ENTIRE squad at one time go "WTF is going on im getting 10fps or 25fps" so there is clearly an issue with the majority of players and optimization. That is my only comment there. MY rig is too powerful to be effected., but have noticed alot of others with optimization issues, especailly AMD at the moment.\n\nGraphics: I still think Arma 3 looks better, But this game is a a close second place. Other games that are graphically better: Dying light, battlefront (DUH) lol, Elite dangerous, and COD. Games on par with it...insurgency is a close 2nd to it.. Games weaker then it: Rainbow six siege, CS:GO, Dayz, H1Z1,  Graphically this game outshines all others in 1 area, TRACERS!!! When that flash of green or red flies past your face and hits the tree next to you, be ready for some memories if your'e a fellow vet. Some of the maps resemble Afghanistan very well, qualats, and the clay walls by dirt roads brings back some memories. Similiar to the insurgency level for those that played, but better done and clearly bigger. There are also urban maps that resemble smaller villages, I havent seen a baghdad style city yet :/  There are also battles done at night.\n\nGameplay: As of right now, there arent any vehicles, its 72 players for most servers. I havent seen a single 100 man server so if I cant continuosly log on and find a 100 player server and always play with that amount then I cant say its 100 players yet, I can always find 72 player games. So 36 men per team from BF4's 32men at the moment, and without those helicopters and tanks man is it alittle more quiet and not as chaotic. It may be more players at the moment but it does not really feel like it compared to all thats going on in say BF4. Everytime I join a squad there are enough people with mics to actually do something. I have not found a silent squad yet. Squads are in groups of 9. The squad leader can set fortifications or ladders things of that nature and the squad pulls out their e-tools and create it. Neat concept.\n\nThe thing that will make this game so likeable is you guys. All the squads are talking, improvising, planning, covering their teammates, it can be thrilling, but and dont hate me here for this BUT to me it feels more like 9v9 all over the place instead of 36v36 or even the mysterious 50v50 servers???  SO what you have is that insurgency style gameplay where your team of 9 maybe 12 if randoms are there try to hold a spot or objective from another team of 9 or 12, then a couple hundred yards away is the same thing at another objective, rinse, wash, repeat, it never feels like one massive battle...I like a massive battle, bf4 feels like a massive battle. I was imagining that when it said 50v50, but it doesnt. bf4 feels like more then 64 players. This game is going to make everyone meaningful to their team. Not feel like mindless clones charging into a fray for awe factor. It will feel like 36 to 50 US Marines in a valley. Where everyones life feels like it matters. Its a cool game design over watching helicopters, tanks and jets explode all around you every 2mins. feels more personal on the SQUAD level. lol\n\nThis is more realistic in a sense,  we dont fight in bf4 style battles at the moment, we arent losing tanks and aircraft left and right in dog fights etc etc etc.  There are a few moments where everyone does kinda collide and when it happens OH MY GOD.  2 squads defending against 3 squads on a hill side with buildables...yea its fun. But its not constantly like that. So this game is closer to real life, in that aspect theres a good bit of running and camping or in the new age we call defending lol to be had.. However real life isnt always jaw dropping and intensly fun like the first 1hr you played of star wars battlefront before you got bored. There is alot of fun to be had working with your team, but its just never going to give you an awe factor. Rainbow six siege didnt give me an awe factor, but i still LOVE it.\n\nThere is also a commander who issues orders to the squad leaders and unlike BF4 failed attempt with tablet commander, there does seem to be a rank structure...Verdict... Start clans, get atleast 18 friends or more in a single match together. That way when squad bravo is under fire and you hear it you might actually debate going to their aid because you know them. Something like that, make your own immersion. If you are alone, put your headset on anyway, you will have a friend before the first round is over.\n\nI recommend the game, Just...heres the thing, 40 dollars isnt worth this game today. It really isnt, but mid 2016, I think 40 would be fine. So I say if you got the cash, go ahead an get it. I have a very strong feeling these guys are going to deliever on an awesome game. I really feel this wont end up a broken promised alpha. The game has been availble on steam for 24hrs so far, Im sure they are going to have performance issues... It hasnt been a week, a month...God when I got a ps4, and BF4 (day they came out) I could only play single player for the first 72hrs as the PSN was swamped by people trying to enter digital codes, make new accounts etc etc. Can we give these guys alittle more then 24hrs after their launch here to get it straight? cool.\n\nlastly Sound: Your voice will sound different to those around you depending on where you are. Guys had a richer voice with an echo in a tunnel, while flat or normal out in the fields. Guns sound different indoors, and at different distances. Theres a radio/ comms click each time you talk to your guys or someone comes over the radio. This game to me at its current state is essentially a slightly better version of insurgency, and if you took several insurgency games going on and combined the severs to into 1 bigger sever. lol so I hoped this helped.","December 16, 2015","true","10.8"," 247 of 331 people (75%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","75","247","331","36","4"

New players are welcomed and others will help you to learn.\n- Easy to learn controls.\n- Great netcode. Play with people all over the world with a lot of players in game and no lag.\n- Huge maps.\n- Extreemly polished for an alpha version of the game. I have found very little bugs.\n- Buildable defenses.\n\nCon's:\n- You will spend a lot of time walking/running around with your squad. This isn't a fast paced FPS so if you are wanting that then this isn't the game for you.\n- Huge maps. Some might not like the size of the maps since it means more walking, however I find them to be perfect as it means flanking is more of an option. Map size also won't be an issue once vehicles have been added.\n\nOverall, this game is easily worth the $40 which seems to be the reason so many are holding off buying the game. It is very polished for an alpha version of the game. The community is friendly and helpful (probably due to the price tag as it's less likely that griefers will spend that much just to get banned). Servers also have active admins who ban people for mass tk's or cheating. Plenty of full servers and no lag.\n\nIf you are a fan of military sims, or enjoyed Arma/Insurgency then this is a must buy!

One issue has been tracked down by the devs as an audio issue in the engine that is resulting in users with AMD CPUs having stuttering and FPS hits. The dev team is actively working on this and the following performance issues. (This has now almost been completely fixed)\n-Poor preformance is also linked to the way the engine handles their animation system.\n-Certian maps are also causing performance issues with certian players.\n--Server Issues--\n-Connecting to servers is a pain in the ♥♥♥. When loading into a server your slot is not saved, so it's a race against whoever else is connecting. This can lead to nearly completely loading into the server just to get kicked out due to it being full. (I now experiance this far less)\n-For some people when the server restarts, they get disconnected. This would be an issue if you enjoyed playing with previous squaddies/friends and want to get back in the action with them.\n--Gameplay/General issues--\n-It's not completely clear if your barrel is or isn't making it over cover, leading to constantly shooting into cover rather than over it.\n-Tree branches appear to be bullet proof. This makes it difficult to effectively engange indaviduals in a forest setting, and exceptionally difficult to accurately hit enemies with GPs since they like to go off on tiny tree limbs.\n-The IU has issues with getting stuck on ones screen. This happens rarely however but the only way to resolve the issues is to disconnect from the server.\n-The amount of communication in a squad is directly porportional to the amount of fun had. If you do not have an active squad leader and or do not have any active squad members, you WILL have a bad time.\n\nNow, to the good:\n\n--Teamwork--\nTeamwork is essential in squad, its the key factor to winning or losing matches. Interacting with fellow squadmates is essential and enjoyable when one is with an active group of indaviduals.\n--Factions--\nCurrently, there are 4 factions; US, Russia, Insurgents and Militia. All factions are modeled very well and have enough differences that they can be told apart from a distance. Militia are now wearing track suits, making it a bit easier to tell them apart from russian troops.\n--Sounds--\n-The audio is damn well done, probably better than DICE did in the battlefield games.\n-I constantly find myself instinctively yelling over gunfire as it's hard to hear my teammates over all the noise.\n-Sounds change depending on the enviroment your in, when inside a building sounds are dampened whereas outside gunfire will echo off the hills.\n--Gunplay--\nReloading, aiming and the recoil of most weapons feels pretty solid. The gun models are also of high quality and very well done.\n--Maps--\n-There are several maps in the Alpha state of the game, all are of a very exceptable size. They vary from straight up wooded areas, to the middle east with mud huts. The terrain mapping and building models are very well done.\n-Building System\nFortifying locations to gain the defensive advantage is a very well fleshed out system in squad. Hopefully more constructable objects will be available at a later time.\n\nIn conclusion, squad is in Early Access so the game has a long way to go. That being said, if you have a strong rig and a strong desire to play in a team focused semi realistic FPS, then you may want to look into picking this up. For those with AMD CPUs, give it a bit of thought before you buy. For me, using -d3d10 as a launch peramiter makes my game completely playable now.\n\nEDIT: Updated some things to account for the new update, changed the conclusion as the preformance issues have been improved a bit.\nEDIT 2: Updated review to reflect 3.9 patch.\nEDIT 3: Added more cons and updated stuff about the performance issues.","December 20, 2015","true","289.9"," 67 of 74 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","67","74","8","0"

It's name was Red Orchestra (RO) and it was good.  A small but close nit community formed around its ground breaking realism play and iron sight aiming method.  Since then, RO went retail and subsequently released RO2 (aka COD:Eastern Front) but none could hold a flame to the original RO mod.  The community descended into ruins.  For 11 years we wandered the barren wasteland of such publications as Battlefield, Arma, Hero's and Generals, Verdun, Insurgency, and DayZ in search of the 'good ole days' of tactical large scale gameplay.  Until now. The search has ended my friends. Behold our magnum opus: Squad.\n\nThe recoil system is the most realistic I have seen. The suppression is just enough to make you cower but not overdone to be annoying.  The beedout and bandage system gives you time to hide and heal but keeps your health low until medics arrive.  The zoom in and hold breath is just right for the distance most engagements happen. The weapon sway is just enough. The graphics are great and not over taxing.  You can hide in the shrubbery.  Snipers do not dominate the game.  The maps are huge and you can flank with out having unnatural boundaries. Squad communication and movement is a must to survive and squad leaders can communicate to each other via push to talk makeing pub games feel like a clan match.  Mobile spawn system keeps a well defined front line of battle without any of the "5 enemies spawning out of a squad-leader's butt behind enemy lines"  bullcrap of the Battlefield series.\n\nWant more?

This is the tactical PVP shooter I have been waiting for. Think Battlefield spliced with the realism and unforgiving nature of Arma (Project Reality too). Boasts 100 players on a match but most servers only have 74 or 50 player matches, but even that many people in a match brings the feel of a large scale battlefield. This is very tactical, team and co op orientated. You are going to die, ALOT, but this game makes you fear getting shot like no other. This game does not favour the lone wolf at all. You'll need to listen and follow your squad leader, like in real life. The best matches are the best coordinated ones, tactically.\n\nAlso to add to that fear and immersion are probably the best rifle sounds I've heard in a game to date. I have fired weapons in real life and this is the closest to that sound I have felt, ever. As accurate as you are going to experience bar the real thing, trust me.\n\nThis is the best military sim/shooter you'll find alongside Arma imo. It may seem the price is steep for early access, and I had the same reservations, but I really feel it's well worth the money. This is a very well developed early access game. Has been in closed alpha for a few months before it was released here on steam so it's had plenty of playtesting and been updated to this solid very playable and very enjoyable build.

And I have to say, I haven't been disappointed and am absolutely hooked.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone. It's slower paced than most other shooters. Death happens without always being able to tell who shot you. Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between friend and enemy. The game relies heavily on teamplay and voice communication - which can be difficult in a server filled with mostly new players. But when those few experienced Squad leaders step up to lead the squads, and voice communication within and between squads gets off the ground, and squads work together as a team, magic happens.\n\nIn no other game have I ever had as much fun as in this one. In no other game have I felt so ridiculously happy and PROUD about a game well played. This game has proven to be more social for me than many MMO's that I played, which are supposed to be built around the social aspect. Even if a match is lost; if your squad worked well, it was still rewarding.\n\nOf course, being an early alpha game, it's far from finished. The performance isn't great on slower systems, because it's graphically not well optimized. There are no vehicles in the game yet (at the time of writing), so expect long stretches of running across terrain (which I personally don't mind about at all. It brings immersion, it gets voice chat with your squad off the ground, and it makes sticking together and staying alive that much more important). There are currently "only" two active game modes and six maps (with several control point layouts, however). But all of that still already manages to produce these experiences that have been better than any others that I have had in gaming.\n\nGraphics are nice. 36-versus-36 battles are impressive to watch on the map. Large-scale strategy becomes an actual factor. Sound is AMAZING - let me stress this again - it is AMAZING. Guns sound like paintball rifles if you're used to games like Call of Duty, but watch any military footage or talk to war veterans and you'll realize that *this is what it sounds like*. You'll hear loud bullet impacts around you before you hear the soft pops in the distance, because of sound's travel speed. You'll hear gunfire and explosions in the distance. Vision gets blurred as bullets hit around you.\n\nThis game is intense. Even if this would be it, it'd still be my favourite game - but this is only the beginning. And I'm thrilled to think about all that's yet to come. With the devs from the Project Reality mod behind it, I have faith that they'll put their everything into making this game the best that they can. And in my opinion, with this game in its current state - on top of their well-functioning, still-alive Project Reality mod for Battlefield 2 - they've already proved their worth twice.\n\nHope to see you in my squad some time. :-)","January 6","true","855.0"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","54","58","5","1"

It is unplayable on the lowest settings. As a PR Veteran I was looking forward to trying out Squad. Alas the game is not optimized for AMD based computers. At this time I do not recommend this game for anyone who has AMD. Intel go right ahead, you're going to have a blast.\n\nEdit: I guess Fanboys are going to Fanboy. Don't get me wrong I think in the long run this game is going to be amazing but UE4 is not great for AMD based computers. The fact that people are downvoting this because it is a negative review of the game shows me the kind of community we are. I thought we were better than this but clearly not. I am raising awareness for AMD users to not buy the game yet. This actually makes them not buy the game yet...which is good. Yes I said it is good that they aren't buying it. Why? Because then they don't leave a negative review as well. One bad review that educates some people is better than twenty negative reviews cause they never saw what I said. So which will it be? One bad review on the front page warning off AMD users for now or it can be twenty bad reviews from AMD users. Once AMD issues are solved I heavily recommend the game to AMD users, until then though I only recommend it to Intel Users. That is why I'm leaving a negative review. As I have said already once UE4 is friendly to AMD users I will recommend this game to everyone and it will be a thumbs up from me. AMD users currently should buy at their own risk. I will keep this review updated. In the meantime I hope people find this helpful rather than just downvoting it since its negative. This review in my opinion will help the game in the long run. One negative review that will be changed to a positive in time or twenty+ that will always be left as negatives. It is the communities choice.\n\nEdit 2: I want to stress that the lack of support for AMD based computers is not Offworld Industries fault. This is an inherent problem with UE4. The Devs cannot do anything about this problem. Some people have managed to have great success with AMD in this game and others like myself cannot play. Some people cannot even get into a match. This is a good game, I'm sure I'll enjoy it in the future. But I cannot leave a positive review of a game that doesn't even work on my system currently. It would be a huge disservice to many people if I did saying "10/10 would tacticool again" and I am leaving this feedback for them so they make a practical decision on what they spend their money on. I look forward to watching this game develop. I'll keep the review updated as it progresses. This is currently the only review I have ever written about a game which should show I clearly care enough about this game to review it. I want this game to succeed, but not at the expense of people who can't even play it.","December 17, 2015","false","0.3"," 327 of 479 people (68%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","68","327","479","15","32"

This game doesn't have either of those things...yet. On a personal note, I feel it's very deceptive advertising your game as something it WILL be rather than something that it IS.\n\nI'll lay out my review with pros and cons and go in depth on certain points.\n\nPROS\n-Very addictive gameplay. The immersion is really impressive. Guns have crazy recoil, even in semi auto. Gunshots crack and sound travels realistically outdoors, while shooting inside has an echo that makes you feel like you will go deaf. RPGs flying nearby will make you ♥♥♥♥ yourself and shots landing close crack and hiss. Suppresion feels right and is actually a viable strategy. If you can't kill an enemy, keeping their heads down usually does the trick.\n\n-Squad cohesion. If you don't have a mic, you'll struggle with this game. Not saying you can't play it, but it is almost essential to do well and you'll honestly be a bit of a burden to your squad without it. Call out your targets, ask the squad leader for advice, and call for a medic. The squad chat channel and command channel sound like real radios and adds a little extra to the game.\n\n-Teamwork is key! You can't win without working together within your squad and with the other squads. There have been several games where the squads will spread out to capture different objectives and watch over potential flanking routes. It's not uncommon for your squad leader to send a small group of his own squad to help out others. Coordinating assaults, flanks, and defence makes all the difference, and one man army players usually get shut down quickly.\n\n-Every battle is memorable. Whether it's a last stand within a compound waiting for reinforcements or a massive flank to catch the enemy by surprise, Squad has easily given me many memories from each match.\n\n-Active developers. My disclaimer at the beginning ended with the word, "yet" because I do believe the devs will get the game to where it is advertised. I believe at least one of them is an ex-marine and this game is their passion project. They listen to their community and are very active on their subreddit /r/JoinSquad. Patches and content are regular and usually very high quality work with few bugs. Also if anyone can capture the realism of combat, it's someone that's seen it firsthand.\n\n-Easy to pick up and learn. The depth of strategies and the maps take some time to learn, but as far as jumping in a game and playing goes, it's as easy as it can be. I find it strikes a perfect middle ground between Arma (entirely realistic, but overly complicated) and Insurgency (arcadey and fast paced with some realism). Add in a mostly friendly and helpful community to fill in the rest and you have the perfect recipe for a fun team based shooter.\n\nCONS\n\n-Animations. As said before, the immersion in this game is amazing...until you see someone jump over a wall without moving their legs. It's in alpha, so I get it, but it's still a slight immersion breaker after almost 50 hours in game.\n\n-Trolls. Anytime their is friendly fire in a game, there will be trolls. Why people spend their money on game to ruin it for others is beyond me. But it's not a huge issue. I think I've run into 3-4 trolls in my playtime and the server admins were quick to kick them from the server. Still worth mentioning.\n\n-Some battles feel one sided. Mostly in servers with clans, but sometimes the maps themselves feel like they favor one group over the other. Chora is a good example to me. While the first capture points are fairly even, the US side gets more cover to their objectives in my opinion, and usually all of their soldiers are easy to tell one from another. The Russians on the other hand look different, some wearing balaclavas and others that look like US soldiers. I have killed several teammates by mistaking them as enemies both at a distance and in CQB by accident because I couldn't distinguish one from another.\n\n-AMD CPUs suffer in this game. AMD GPUs are fine, but the CPUs really struggle to keep up with the game as of right now. The devs have addressed this as an issue with the Unreal engine that they've used and they're looking into solutions. I run an FX6350 and a GTX970 and in a fully populated 72 man server at mostly medium settings, I hover between 25-35 fps in smaller firefights. It dips to the low 20s or lower for a second or two when it gets more chaotic.\n\n-It's really hard to play as a class you want to play as. Sometimes I just want to be a marksman and provide long range cover for my squad. Unfortunately that class gets filled almost instantly. Any class with an optic does actually. Optics aren't game changing (if you can't hit ♥♥♥♥ without one, you still won't hit anything with one) but they can provide a huge advantage. Or I want to be a machine gunner, laying down suppresive fire with an RPK. Too bad my squad doesn't have a medic, which is an essential role in this game. Even being squad leader can be a pain when you have someone being subbordinate and demeaning your every move. Offering an opinion on a situation is fine, but often times you'll have one or two players that try to be backseat squad leaders, which is frustrating.\n\n-Price. Personally not a con for me. I've gotten and will get more than my money's worth out of this game. But $40 is a lot of money for an early access game.\n\nOVERALL\n\nThe game is fantastic. Most of my cons are nit picking to be honest. I like mil-sim shooters and working with a team, so this game is great for me. So if you enjoy the same things, grab a mic and squad up!","February 15","true","113.3"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","47","51","2","7"

Some people title it a MilSim, when it really isn't and it is not trying to. Instead, it finds a good balance between MilSim and FPS.\n\nActually, why am I so convinced that the game will be great when it leaves Early Access? Well, firstly, because many of the developers are (former or current) developers of Project Reality, which I spoke about, above. And they worked on that Battlefield 2 mod for over 10 years now, taking so much out of that over 10 year old engine that you wouldn't believe. They made a game targeted for 2x2 km battles and turned it into a full-scaled huge military game with so many assets and aspects, that it turned into a niche in itself.\nNow SQUAD is going to fill that niche, as well.\nBut - With a NEW engine and therefor: new possibilites, new aspects, new features, less bugs (because finally, this concept on a new engine without over 10 year old restrictions). And I have so much hope and love for this game, because this niche is something very special to me.\n\nTo write it in the current internet jargon "ARMA without autism" and "9001/10 would serve militery egain."\n\nNow down to the questions some people might have v\nHow are the graphicsThis is something people like to argue about in any game, because everyone has different expectations.\nI find the graphics incredible, but then again I didn't play all the AAA-FPS shooters in the last years as I was boycotting ElectronicFarts for quite a few years now.\nLooking at some Youtuber-footage now and then I would say SQUAD doesn't come off as very close to AAA-graphics.\nThing is... I don't expect it?! The main focus of this game is the gameplay itself.\nAnd again, I'm a Project Reality player, does 11 year old graphics tell you anything?  ;)\n\nHow is the performancePerformance is a very wide factor because everyone experiences different things.\n- AMD CPU users seem to suffer under various unoptimizations under the current Unreal-Engine-4 build (obviously developed by Epic, and not Off World Industries who made Squad).\nThe game relying on this engine means it suffers the same issues but then again has a very dedicated development team which is focused on the engine alone and will fix these issues sooner or later (they'd be working on it by a few days by now as I read).\n- AMD GPU users (like me) have issues with certain driver-versions. I had huge problems with the 15.x drivers no matter if I ran under Crimson or CatalysControlCenter Software. Downgrading to 14.x and applying various INI-file twaks I found on the official forums ( forums.joinsquad.com ), made my game hop to 60 FPS on my pretty old AMD HD 7970 @ 3GB VRAM.\nRight now, everything is working as it should and I'm super happy about this.\n\nObviously, this whole topic is something still being worked on heavily and also\n\nHow is gameplayThe gameplay is already very similar to Project Reality INF-only layouts, you basically rely on your team communication, on your Squad Leader and on your teammates (damn, what would you do without medics in this game?). Lonewolfing without being in a Squad is a No-No, just like RPG-spamming (will be gone once the supply system which'll be bound to vehicles is finished) and not talking while being an SL (you can very well not talk as a squad member, but please don't do squad lead in that case).\n\nWhere are the vehicles?Calm your ♥♥♥♥, the devs still want to optimize the game before they throw in new assets.\nAlso, vehicles will require a lot of balancing for battles, this aspect will take a lot of time, too.\nI expect the first ground vehicles (HMMVV, MTLB) within the next 1-2 months.\nAirborne vehicles are more likely to come 6+ months later.\n\nYour question?Do you have any questions left before thinking about buying?\nIf so, feel free to be polite in the comments.","December 17, 2015","true","33.4"," 51 of 61 people (84%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","84","51","61","10","8"

Beautiful, realistic maps, effects and situations. Nicely done Offworld! What ruins it are the players who bully others and cause general disruption within the team. Everyone is there to learn the game (and there is a LOT to learn), and we all need to help each other. This is NOT a single player run and gun shooter. The only way to win the round is by working in sync with your squad, and your squad working in sync with the entire team. Hey..if you aren't the greatest shooter, bandage up your teammate or help dig a barrier- you get as many points for that as for kills!

Myself and the rest of 2nd Squad are perched up on top of Hill 15.  A hill which we had just taken away from militia control only moments before.  Our Sgt. has us build defenses and before you know it we have a small but capable FOB from which we provided covering fire and relayed enemy movements to our squads in town.  Our Sgt. got a radio call from 4th squad saying they were pinned down by enemies coming in through the southern entrace of the town.  He made the call to move 2nd squad down into the town west and through the middle to come out on the other side and catch the militia out in the open.  Well the militia saw it coming and in between rounds of AK and RPK fire we were ordered to fall back to the center of town to regroup and resupply.  I look around for my squad and I only see the autorifleman, Dunlap.  Dunlap and I were split from our squad by a sea of angry militiamen.  So we cautiously make our way back through the town.  Covering each other as we cross alleys, streets, fields.  I didn't even know his first name and yet he was my best friend.  Finally catching up to the squad I suddenly hear a loud snap and my vision faded out.  I'd been shot.  Dunlap was calling out to me telling me to hold on but before I knew it he was down too.  We laid there, taking in our last breaths thinking about how we got there.  But it wasn't over yet.  A friendly voice approached.  A fellow rifleman, phozz, had come to our rescue.  After a few moments of silence he said something so profound, so life changing, it shook me to the core..."F*** I don't have a medkit"\n\n-----\n\nFor real though, this game is awesome and I can't wait to see where it goes.  There is a learning curve but it's nowhere near as steep as say Arma's or OFP.  You can jump right in and the community (so far...don't let me down here guys) has been very helpful and an absolute joy to play with.  The in game VOIP is the best I've ever used in any game period.  It's great to see a competitive shooter that absolutely hinges on team play.  And the sound design my GOD!!! The distance sounds of gunshots and explosions made me anxious to move up and see what exactly was going on.  The weapon sounds are spot on in this game.  My heart was pounding as a sniper was taking shots at us as we took cover in our FOB.  I'm a milsim fanatic so I can't recommend this game enough to people who enjoy milsims and tactical shooters alike.  Play it. Love it.

It is sooo hard to see enemies over a distance.\n\nFor me this Game seems to be most fun if you defend and build a base, of course.\n\nExactly that happened in my second Game.\nI joined a German server and played in a german squad, everybody was working together and it was fun. We secured a Compound and prepared to defend, there they came...\nDont try to shoot an RPG through a Doorway, might get TKs for that xD\n... while trying to apologize to the remains of my Teammates, i was trying to bring down some nice RPG fire on those enemies closing in from two Directions. We cant go on the rooftops. We cant peek. We try to fortify us with more Sandbags. I hide behind a Wall in the middle of our Compound, a Medic runs up to me to get some healing done. I look at him, a young boy maybe 18, he shows no fear, he does his best as a Medic.\nSuddenly a read cloud, noooooo Jimmy !!!!! he gets shot ! an enemy made it through one of the side entrances.\nI hide behind the same Wall, reload my RPG and peek out.\nClick! There it flys right into his Face, i see his body flying to the left.\nI look at Jimmy. The squadleader shouts to hold the position. I get my AK out and run to the uncovered spot where the enemy broke through. R.I.P Jimmy\n\nOverall i can recommend this Game after my first Session today. The long Range visibility Problem is annoying, but you just cant change that on such big Maps, not seeing enemies is also kinda realistic. This aint no COD baby.\n\n\nEDIT 1: No Matter how i change the Graphic Settings i always seem to get above 40 frames and in some situations it drops to 30. I hope that performancewise a notable change will happen soon. Still not bored of this game :)\n\nEDIT 2: Srsly some of these people cant be legit... i cant see a ♥♥♥♥ing thing and i am not even visible and i already get shot at... there is no way they could know where i am crawling (up some random ♥♥♥♥ing hill in nowhere), i really like this game but it keeps frustrating me that 70% of the time you have no idea who shoots you and how they can see you. I understand that it is kinda the way it is supposed to be (realistic) but the visibility is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad, it feels like everybody else has WH and Aimbot sometimes. WE NEED A ZOOM FEATURE, without having to aim the weapon.\n(please note, i wrote this when i was frustrated :P )\n\nEDIT 3: If you want to watch a typical round on one of the shorter Gamemodes go ahead (yes i played this) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw2e3Ekv45E\n\nEDIT 4: I thought i just add a more action packed clip aswell, so you can see what the combat feels like when you defend a compund.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdIoyZQZCEA\n\nEDIT 5: So the new Version was released, good to see new content coming. They are also still trying new things out and they dont hesitate to remove them again (Aimblur), i like that.","February 29","true","41.4"," 43 of 53 people (81%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","81","43","53","13","5"

Even as an alpha, the gameplay and strategic processes involved in a coordinated battle between 72 individuals is as rigorous as any military themed CQC games. As new elements are introduced, such as the recent addition of new maps/and the famed Mod Deuce .50, the tactics previously used in past versions evolve to accomodate these new assets, so every month seems to bring about a new wave of ideas and strategies. New players are met with a new-player friendly game where roles are taken seriously and each individuals main purpose is to support the squad/fire team element to the maximum of their capacity. Whilst other modes highlighting talents of clan vs clan and precision on the battlefield, public games with random individuals who coordinate with each other effectively to win the game leads to a higher satisfaction of teamwork, leading to friends who will challenge you to become better and more effective on comms/gameplay/situational awareness. The graphics are amazing, and albeit the gore of wounds could leave a bit to be desired, the sounds of AK fire snapping overhead is enough for anyone to hit the dirt midsprint. I'd encourage any milsim/FPS aficionado to try Squad, spend a few hours playing each role and getting used to the dynamic of the game before stepping up the plate as a Squad Leader.

In one word, amazing! If you are familiar with the large-scale teamwork oriented gameplay from Project Reality, then you will understand the type of gameplay the Squad developers are trying to achieve. There is nothing like being a part of a 9-man squad on a 50 player team going up against the enemy in epic 100p multiplayer battles on maps as large as 4km^2. There is nothing like it in PC gaming. ArmA? Kind of except you do not need to be part of a clan community to get the kind of teamwork that you need to be successful in this game. Insurgency? Not quite.

It heavily focuses on squad based (obviously) infantry engagements, with the main goal to capture and hold more positions than the enemy. The HUD is very simple adding to the sense of realism. This game feels like a more realistic Battlefield, but not as complicated as Arma 3. Considering it's only in alpha, i hope the devs keep their promises about expansion and the addition of vehicles and anticheat. So far it's an incredibly immersive experience that leaves you forgetting you're even playing a video game. It's very unique. Squad requires you have a great deal of patience, and are able to take orders from competent squad leaders. Without a good squad leader you can often end up in a state of chaos where the enemy can easily overrun you. So you need to be good at learning and adapting quickly to intense situations to get any enjoyment out of the game. A good mic helps too.\n\nPROS:\n+ Incredibly Realistic Sounds & Gameplay\n+ Requires heavy teamwork and voice communication\n+ Gun ballistics feel very close to real life\n+ Has a large playerbase\n\nCONS:\n- Takes time and patience to learn\n- Having a microphone is essential\n- Price is rediculous for an alpha\n- Some servers take the game way too seriously\n- US servers are incredibly toxic compared to EU/AU\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nIf you enjoy military simulations and you're okay with cutting the fat and getting straight into infantry combat, Squad may be for you. As long as you have the patience to listen, learn, and adapt, you'll have a fun time.\n\nRecommended.\n8/10 If i didnt already have PTSD i'd have it now.","January 11","true","25.8"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","39","48","5","6"

You won't find the feeling you get when you play it anywhere else. The adrenaline rush when you're assaulting an entrenched enemy position or when you're the last man standing in your squad and still manage to kill the remaining soldiers of the enemy squad that just wiped out yours is something hard to describe, those games when your squad is the only one defending a keypoint, outnumbered, while everyone else is out there to capture the next flag... And it will only get better when they add vehicles and bigger maps, note that the ingame maps are already huge when compared to other shooters.\n\nI hear some people are experiencing problems with AMD processors, which isn't my case.

This game is absolutely stunning. However, and this goes without saying, it needs some optimization. Frames are perpetually low no matter what setting you play due to how some models are rendered and some kinks with AMD CPUs. But this is early access and this is a team you can trust to develop an ambitious game like this. Hell, they've already done it once for free before.\nBe sure to check out the standalone Battlefield 2 mod "Project Reality" before buying.

The only thing working for it now, is only it's concept, it's "how they want it to be".\nFor a game to work, from both a competitively and casual POV, a game it needs to perform in 3 areas:\n\n-Technical\n\nGame is not working properly from a technical POV. Disco's, lag and low FPS on high end system. These low frames even drop further when server reaches a certain amount of filled slots.\n\n-Balance\n\nOnly infantry available ATM. Balance between factions and classes seems ok. There's not one class to rule them all. All classes are dependant on the other classes to perform. No vehicles available ATM, so no opinion on the balance between them.\n\n-Cheatfree enviroment\n\nThe game is starting to get infested with cheaters. The developers are reacting to it to slow and to naïve. The serveradmins seems to be and will become the main protection against cheaters. Serveradmins are still humans and because humans can be uninformed and can get influenced, this sytem will break down quickly, like it did in other games that relied on this system. In a game where intel, stealth, dropping the first shot,... is of vital importance to win or lose, 2 or 3 wallhackers that are going unnoticed during a round, will become the gamechangers. If these kinda cheats are not dealt with, a victory will not be decided by gameplans, but with the amount of cheaters a team had.\n\nFrom this moment in time, prioritization of the developers will decide if this game will succeed or not. Considering the above 3 and it's €40 pricetag, I can't recommend this game for now.

Time for me to sit down and review this game having put in a solid 20+ hours and now have a grasp on what this game is about and what that might mean for you the player/consumer. Take a minute to read through my review and if there are too many words and letters, skip to the end for my final verdict. I use a standard review format on Steam when it comes to categories, so some apply, some do not. This is probably one of the most honest reviews you'll find on here so take that or leave it.\n\n\nOverview\nWhat is Squad? When I first heard about this game I admittedly missed the Kickstarter, missed the big news announcements, missed the gaming convention announcements, I basically goofed and came into this late. I saw the name and the logo on Steam (as an upcoming title) and was immediately unimpressed. "Squad"? That's lame.  Then I watched the trailer. My interest was piqued.\n\nSo I did some digging and research. Found out the game is the spiritual successor to the mod, "Project Reality" made by those mod devs. I had played PR when it first came out many many years ago and haven't touched it since. So I had NO idea what they did to it.\n\nI then watched pre-Alpha gameplay and immediately realized this was a game I was looking for. As a former military servicemember (Marine Corps Infantryman), and a tactical realism player this game seemed to fit right into my gaming niche. I found the Kickstarter page which showed vehicles they intended to put in, and other great and amazing features you don't find much in today's shooters.\n\nFast forward to Steam launch and now I get to experience it. This is a hardcore, unrelenting tactical shooter. It's an in your face, no holds barred look into life on the battlefield. As someone who set foot in Iraq conducting combat operations, this game felt like what real life does (as best as any game can).\n\nYou'll find yourself hunkered down behind H-Barriers with snaps of rounds over your head, grenades blowing up nearby, and a constant state of utter confusion as to WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?! Your radio will be blowing up in your ear as squadmates call out contacts, and you'll be engaged in some brutal firefights. But, not all the time (see below).\n\n\nGraphics\nGraphics are extremely important to a lot of people in this day in age. Many PC gamers will spend thousands of dollars on ridiculous rigs and expect top notch graphics as a result. So it's worth noting the graphics in this game in my review.\n\nSquad utilizes Unreal Engine 4... which is arguably one of the best engines available to the masses right now on a commercial level. I have a project of my own I am working on with UE4 so while I could be called biased, I did a lot of research. UE4 is strong, powerful, and stable. It's a well built engine that commercially speaking is cheap for the developer, and allows some of the best graphical enhancements available today.\n\nSquad does a really solid job of having graphics that are on par with today's standards, but cuts corners on some things. For example, the player models don't exhibit facial expressions, different facial models to look different than the exact same modeled player. When the player dies they look exactly like the model when they were alive (eyes open, ready to go to work).\n\nThe ground textures can be underwhelming at times in some areas, while the overall scope of everything you see on the screen can be absolutely stunning in some maps. It's a toss up but one thing is made clear, the graphics are where they need to be and will only (likely) get better as the game is improved upon, updated, and optimized.\n\n\nCombat\nThis is why you bought this game or are contemplating it. The combat. This game features a realistic approach to a LARGE SCALE combat zone. Right now only infantry based, you will fight on maps with upwards to 50 vs 50 players through wooded terrain, open deserts, Middle Eastern villages, and more.\n\nCombat in this game is unforgiving. If you slip up, you die. If you run off on your own, you'll probably die. If you move too fast, you'll die. If you move too slow, you'll die. You have absolutely GOT TO work with your teammates in order to succeed. I've seen guys go 70+ kills and less than 10 deaths. I've seen guys go with 10 kills and 70 deaths. Neither player was "better" than the other if they didn't contribute to the MISSION. If they ran off and did their own thing, they were a terrible player regardless of stats.\n\nAs I said in my intro, you will find yourself in rabid, bite the neck battles. You may even come down to a hand to hand fight swinging E-tools with your enemy (that happened to me once). But other times you may feel like you're running for 10 minutes only to suddenly die by an invisible enemy (one you never saw coming) and have to respawn again. It's the hard nature of the game and oddly enough just like real life in the sense that you may do a lot of walking and may only see action for a few minutes.\n\nExpect to both love and hate the combat in this game. Expect some amazing experiences that once you put the headset down, you collect yourself and feel good about it... while also getting completely frustrated when your squad didn't work together.\n\n\nSkills, and Upgrades\nThe squad is the backbone of this game. "Upgrades" come in the form of classes for your player. Each one has a player model, and each one has a kit (of gear). Each one unlocks with the more players you have in your squad.\n\nSo, starting out with a squad of one... you'll have a Squad Leader. Add two players and you'll gain a medic slot, and a fighter slot (standard infantry rifleman). Add more players and you gain access to RPG kits, Grenadiers (40mm's), and eventually the Marksman (sniper role). Each class is extremely important to the overall success or failure of the team.\n\n\nGame Performance\nI run a PC with the following specs:\n\nAMD FX-8370 (8 core CPU) @ 4.01ghz\nG.Skill RAM 16GB @ 1600mhz\nAsus GTX 960 2GB\nWindows 10\n\nYou have to understand one thing right off the bat... this is an Early Access (Alpha) title. If you can understand that and appreciate that, you wont be disappointed. If you expect a bug free game, a game without launcher crashes, CTD's, compatibility problems, etc... you should not pick this game up.\n\nI run an average of about 30fps. Sometimes less (around 20) sometimes more. I have most settings maxed with shadows on Medium. I normally put them on low but this game they appear like disgusting blobs (a fence will look like poka dots on the ground). So medium is my best performance to quality spot for shadows.\n\nI have a few problems with being disconnected from servers (always at the worst time or when I feel like I'm rocking on the server). This is a known issue. But the overall performance of the game is pretty solid for an Alpha (better than most I've played).\n\n\nSEE MY FINAL VERDICT IN THE COMMENTS SECTION OF THIS REVIEW\n\nI had to cut this review short because of Steam's maximum character limit. See the remainder of my review in the comments section to the right (or below, depending on where you are reading this).","December 21, 2015","true","39.6"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","25","31","2","15"

An avid Battlefield or COD player will find this game boring. Most engagements occur with you trading fire at medium to long range, trying to shoot a target you can barely see. This game is very tactical and can be thrilling with radio chatter, real tactics and intense engagements when your squad leader is experienced.\n\nMost attempts at a run and gun that works so well in other shooters just gets you killed fast in this game. Personally, I love that.\n\nThe maps are so huge you could spend the whole time circling the perimeters in flanking and not see the enemy, bad for the twitch shooter but good for the tactical military shooter. I've been laying in wait and when not moving you are very hard to see depending on the board and your cover. I was able to ambush several enemy soldiers before being overrun by players smart enough to stick together.\n\nHad I been with my squad, we could have set up a perimter and held that position, setting up an F.O.B. so we can spawn there now then pushing forward towards the objective, which is always to take the enemies base at this time. F.O.B.s can be captured from the enemy as well and then used as spawn points.\n\nPlay is 9 man squads, up to 50 players per team though right now the norm is 36. The 100 player servers tend to crash when full at this time. You can join a squad or form your own. Players can select from roles such as Medic, Rifleman, Grenadier, Leader, Sniper etc with diffrent loadouts. Most weapons come with iron sights at this time making seeing the enemy first key.\n\nFull microphone support, vehicles are slated to be added to the game as updates are distributed. No in game tutorial exists at htis tme, check below and YT for existing help videos.\n\nWill update review as game evolves.\n\n\nOriginal review:\n\n\nPicure a modern military boots on the ground movie where you have a squad of soldiers all defending a perimeter, trading bullets at medium to long range while hunkered down behind cover. Six soldiers rush their positions, gunfire erupts as the charge is pushed back.\n\nThe radio crackles, Squad Leader calls for a push forward. Slowly they advance, covering eachother in leapfrogs, utilising smoke grenades, setting up F.O.B.s to establish a new front line.  You not only can you do this, the game is geared so you must do this.\n\nThs game plays out like a modern engagement, and it's in Alpha. Buggy but playable and totally awesome.\n\nWait for the sale but this game is what I have wanted in a FPS for a long time. Make sure you have a microphone and watch this video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ8lccr0u6M\n\nIt's Squad Tutorial so you can at least function with the basics.","December 15, 2015","true","21.7"," 58 of 89 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","58","89","4","0"

Perhaps it's not a diehard simulation like Arma 3, but like Arma 3, the challenge you'll get from Squad, despite it being about as casual as the Battlefield series of games, will keep you coming back for more.\n\nRich, authentic and downright chilling sound design and detailed environments which explore a range of variety in both scale, terrain type and infrastructure which can and will impact maneuverability of vehicles and foot soldiers.\n\nProjectile arching is very much a thing to realize and compensate for with either firearms, rockets and of course grenades with grenades having an optional underhanded throw for shorter distances for those over-the-fence or out-the-window tosses.\n\nOverpressure from explosions withing confind spaces like building interiors and backblast from rocket launchers exist as well. So even if you're fairly far away from a grenade when it goes off in the same building you're in, you'll still feel it or possibly even die from it. And think twice before firing an RPG inside of a building. Your eyeballs and lungs will explode and you'll also probably end up harming or killing other friendlies inside your building.\n\nMoving is pretty good. The weapon sway/bob is a bit like Battlefield which gets annoying if you fail to work with it. But movement is pretty solid. This makes firing while absolutely stationary being the ideal position to fire from.\n\nAnd keep in mind for this next body of text, there're differences between walking, jogging and sprinting. Jogging being the default speed which isn't stamina intensive.\n\nLike sprinting, jumping requires stamina too and consumes stamina based on how many times you jump over a short period of time. This also limits how much you can jump as you need stamina for both sprinting and jumping. Although there is a key for switching between jogging and walking, there's almost no difference from what I can tell. I think walking increases the amount of stamina regenerated while still moving, but by an extremely small amount. Jogging from left to right is much slower than jogging back and forth but I guess it helps with clearing around corners with your sights up.\n\nMoving up and down ladders in Squad is the most intuitive ladder mechanic I've ever seen in any game. Just walk into a ladder to go up and walk backwards to go down. Or vice-versa if you're turned around.\n\nMoving around while prone is pretty cool. You always have  your weapon pointed outward and ready to fire like you would actually be able to do by crawling on your opposite forearm as your forward method of movement.\n\nThe communication is terrifically crisp and audible with a realistic radio audio filter slapped on for authenticity and immersion. Individual squad leaders can communicate with each other while the lower ranking soldiers are only able to communicate with their designated squad leader and vice-versa.\n\nIf you want the scale, infantry combat, communication and minor simulated elements of Arma, the sound quality, ease of movement and weapon aspects such as backblast of Insurgency and the casual accessibility and gameplay of Battleifeld then this is your game.\n\nAnd it doesn't look half bad to boot! Unreal Engine 4 is quite pretty.\n\n\n\nWhen I can, I'll be sure to update this review as this ALPHA game developes further down the road and features are both added and improved upon. Remember - everything about this game as I type this is subject to change.\n\nVehicles based on factions will be added as developement continues.\n\nI believe TrackIR support will come eventually as well.","December 15, 2015","true","18.0"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","35","50","4","0"

If you have AMD products wait for them to fix it.\n\nLet's start off addressing the elephant in the room, AMD performance.\n\nMy specs are as follows:\n\nNVidia GTX 970 4GB\n16 GB of Corsair Vengence ram.\nAMD FX-6300 6-Core CPU\n\nNow with that setup I can run just about any modern game at Ultra 1920x1080 60+fps.\nSo I thought Squad would be no different. Squad seemed to agree with me, when it ran it's diagnostics\nit set the settings on ultra.\n\nSo, I booted up the firing range; 120 FPS.\n"Wonderful", I thought.\nSo, I joined a server and saw why everyone was complaining; 28fps with lag dips constantly taking me down to 5-10 fps for short moments.\n\nA little sleuthing told me that it may be a problem with the audio engine. So, I edited an INI and changed a setting or two.\n\nI scored 2 extra frames per second.\n\nAt this point you may be wondering why I would reccommend this game. "Why Zach", you might tell me, "If what you say is true, it's garbage; unplayable!" To which I would respond with this retort, "but it fun tho".\n\nThe game is incredibly fun, even with the lag spikes and poor frame rates.\n\nFor early access and only being in alpha, the game is coming along very well.\n\nGraphics are mostly pleasing right now, although improvements should be made.\n\nAudio is fantastic, everything really sucks you in.\n\nGunplay is great, bullets have a realistic damage model and bullet drop. Yet it isn't like Arma where I felt I couldn't hit anything.\n\nWhat really makes this game for me though is the community. Most everyone is friendly, and I have yet to hear someone claiming to have "done the copulation" with my mom.\n\nThe complaints I have right now include:\nAMD performance\nCan be really difficult to see enemies.\nTextures and general muddiness in the graphical area.\n\nOverall this game is amazing. All it needs to make it a must have for anyone interested in more realistic style shooters is better performance.\n\nIt's worth getting right now if you are running an NVidia-Intel setup but if you have anything AMD, wait for them to fix it.","April 3","true","18.8"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","21","27","2","0"

Here's some buy/no buy advice based on what this game is and will be.\n\nReasons to Buy:\n1. Teamwork. The thrill of accomplishing a common goal with a cohesive unit is greater than any other game I have ever experienced. (That's a lot of games)\n2. Fellowship. It's fun to socialize with people like you and make life-long gaming friends. I certainly have.\n3. Realism/Gameplay. Most people field these two as opposing forces that mark the difference between Arma and Battlefield; fun or boring; simulator or shooter. Gameplay > Realism? Realism > Gameplay? Squad has both. Realism = Gameplay. 'Nuf said.\n4. Longevity. Squad's predecessor, Project Reality, has achieved a following since 2006 and has become a constantly enhancing game with updates still being pushed out. Squad is breathed by the same Gods and will be much the same.\n5. Creators. The Devs will personally discuss with anyone on what they can do to improve the game just as they will watch your back during the heat of combat. This ain't EA. These guys care. They're giving it to you for $40 and someday it will be worth so much more. They deserve your money.\n6. Renaissance. The concept that is this game is unique. Imagine Battlefield's combined warfare, Arma's teamwork, Red Orchestra's casualness, and Insurgency's flow. Add huge maps and much else and you get Squad. Why has no one made this game yet??\n\nReasons not to buy:\n1. Early Access. Squad is not comparable or up to par with Project Reality. If you want a working game, patience you must have.\n2. Immaturity/mic. Squad is designed for a mature player who can communicate by mic. You will not feel what this game has to offer if you possess neither of those.\n3. Combat Pace. No 360' no scopin' fools. If you're partial to those games, you'll be disappointed here. Combat pace anywhere between Red Orchestra and Arma, depending on the map.\n4. Walking Simulator. This will change when vehicles are added, but Squad will probably feel like a walking simulator to everyone at some point. Admirable graphics are an instant fix of this for me. IMO, most games don't give you the time to appreciate the finer textures and lights like this one will. Environment will immerse you.\n5. Hardware. Currently in this un-optimized pre-alpha state, the performance is quite low when on populated servers. I probably would not be having fun if it weren't for GTX 780 + 4770k. Others may be frustrated if they purchase it so soon.","December 15, 2015","true","11.1"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","28","40","0","0"

On on hand its been an awesome immersive experience with casual tactical gameplay, on the other ive been experiencing massive lag spikes that are at times unplayable. Before i get hate, i understand that I have paid into an early access game that is being worked on constantly. This is why I beleive that squad has HUGE potential as its bridging the gap between casual shooters such as Battlefield, Call Of duty and more tactical slower paced titles like Arma 3. My only concern is the influx of squeekers and "toxic" players that dont communicate or play the objective if the game goes on steam sale or the game is endorsed by certain youtubers ;) (no names). This can be overridden by careful decisions on behalf of the development team.\n\nAll in all If your someone who can maturely play as a team BUY THE GAME!

Huge, beautiful maps with great game modes. Some very intense firefights where maneuvering and coordination beats run & gun every time.\n\nCons: One of the most glitchy games ever, every map has a few players taking advantage of shooting through walls or terain with immunity. Scopes are OP, everyone rushes to fill those slots and the 10% of players with optics get 90% of the kills. If you don't have a scope, keep some Ibuprofen on hand because you'll spend the whole game a few inches from the screen trying to tell if those few pixels are a bush or an enemy, and hopefully not an enemy with a scope. Russians and US look too similar, so again, hopefully you have optics. You really need a decent computer so you can crank up textures so you can see what is what, hopefully you have optics. US are OP, their basic infantry have red-dots, it just isn't balanced.\n\nMaybe in another year or two this game will be worth it, it is still in Alpha.","February 14","false","119.7"," 44 of 69 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","44","69","8","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UncleBoom/recommended/393380/","UncleBoom","Uncle Boom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UncleBoom/","40 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nStarted off playing PRBF2\nSquad came to my attention and I was really excited.\n\nI played Arma 3 and always hated how long it took to get into the thick of things, Squad looked like a better environment for tactical teamwork (if you are blessed enough to have a good group of tactical players)...\n\nJoin a match and pick a squad. Get told to catch up or be kicked. Listen to others told to catch up or be kicked. When rounds start snapping SL is silent, and no one is coordinating any movements or responses at all. "Catch up or get kicked." ... Sometimes you get extra lucky - listen to kids sing Spongebob squarpants songs, or maybe it's half no-mic's and half flamers -talking race and politics the whole time.\n\nRemind the SL to post a rally, recommend a location, or try to help guide a good decision - and get excuses 100% of the time.\n\nTake incoming shots and listen to either silence, or half information - range but not direction, direction not range - try to help point out mistakes and get more excuses.\n\nGet shot at and take cover - turn around and see your team-mates bobbing behind you as you lay still trying not to be shot. They will literally use you for visual concealment and get pissy when you tell them to go away and stop giving away your position.\n"Sorry I violated your personal space." - actually said to me in a game after this happened.\n\nOpen your map to help coordinate information and a giant ♥♥♥♥♥ is scrawled in icons across the whole map - made with love by people's children who happen to be playing on your team.\n\nWonder why every single game a whole 9 man squad is either FARRRR across the map camping a point which is of NO significance, OR they are huddled around the "FOB" building a "base" with the 5 or 6 placable barracades... for the whole match.\n\nSquad needs a medic? Step Up! CLS OSCAR MIKE!\n...."mmmmMedic" .... "mmmmMedic"\n"Uncle Boom over here! Get me up man Revive me dude Please! Quick!!"\nYou follow the lil red dot to the casualty - then you look up either just in time to be shot by the guy who shot the wounded, or shoot it out with them and live to repremand the IDIOT who was blabbering at you -\n"DUDE CALL the Danger Close, WHERE did they shoot from, How Many, REAL INFORMATION..."\nand get a nervous chuckle in the mic. A little Laugh and a hollow "Thanks" if you are lucky.\n\nGet killed while on the way to objectives and NEVER see the guys waiting for you - sitting still in the trees. They are always there if you fight a good team of Frenchies or British guys, they know where you set up and tighten in - farming kills while your team avoids them like the plague - losing every asset at risk and WORSE - getting CAMPED on those assets (Rallies and "FOB"s) for the rest of the game. Things that could be worked on with a little creative coding ... but...\n\nSuggest that you have an issue with the design of the game. Go ahead. I mean, it started out as a pretty normal community - I say as a guy who cruised the forums a lil and posted once or twice. But it seems lately - if you criticize this game - be ready to fake a whole military career, just like 95% of Squad players who will use their fake story to discredit your views and dismiss your gripes. Why? Because F you. "What's your MOS?" .... It seems even the Mods and Devs make a practice of chin checking people over supposed Military Service - its sad. To be clear don't fake anything, but be ready to be summerarily dismissed for not having served/seen combat, I'm sure they do it all.\nIt really seems like this game is being made for a select group of people who enjoy a blend of Halo - full sprint run and jump across the map camp the objective and beastmode whole squads with spur of the moment flanks - and Arma 3 - where they can pretend they are soldiers and wave their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ around in the forums - while pretending to play a game.\n\nIf that sounds cool then you might like the deal it is at $40 - $50 dollars.\n...Oh - no Vehicles, many nice teasers of them - but huge issues that have kept details from us since they were first teased 6m ago.\n...servers that are either CRAMMED or Dead.\n...a handful of weapons you will never get to use because you only get 3 or so kits for every 9 players who group up,\n...the FOB building which is disappointing and limiting,\n...no free look so good luck keep tabs on your "Tacticool" buddies who wont bother telling you they are moving...\nLets see - OH 50 cal emplacements are coming so if you haven't been popped off of a ridge at 1k+ by an AK wait to find out what those will do.\n...the Acog kit is weird and the kick is STUPID on the M4, single only and good luck following up...\n...Want "practice"? like... to TRY the guns and kits, and to see what works and what don't? ...OH none of that either you just join a match and snag the first kit you can - then abscond with it to "test" it all the while ignoring your SL who is threatening to kick you from the squad if you don't do what he says...\n...There are issues with maps - players able to use spots to hide undetected - you'll NEVER figure out where they are. Admin is getting better so some SOME servers have ACTIVE admins who ban cheese heads.\n...The RESPAWN SCREEN - Cryptic and Wonky, Prompts you to select a spawn but wont communicate ANYTHING else to you, other than a timer - which is madening because you'll get shot, open up the TAB menu, select "Give Up", Check the map, select a spawn to spawn in at, click "Close" which is also "OK" as in "I'm ready to spawn in Let's Play!" ... aaaannddd\nWait for the timer. Wait for it... Wait for it....\n"Please select a spawn"\nAGAIN\nlol you will do this over and over.\n"Hang on Buddy I'm on the way! ...in 5 seconds... SH*T hold on, spawn, yes, GO!"\nover and over.\n\nPOSITIVE? .......\nYou want some Good News?\n-Graphics are sick. It's very natural looking and the effects of light and dust are amazing.\n-Gameplay is a lot faster than Arma, and almost burns you out over the course of the 45-120 minutes it usually takes for a match to run it's course.\n- The CQB feels Great. No laggy hit detection that I notice, the suppression effects are well done.\n- Medical is existant. Bleeding state, bandages and healthkit used to refil bandaged casualties' health. You can run out of bandages making CLS an exciting job on a few levels.\n- Comms are a thing as well, Squad leaders have access to Command channel, while players in a squad have squad net, and everyone has local as well. There is some superstition about using local to call for medics - they say the enemy can hear it - although I can't confirm that I've ever heard a person I've killed.\n- There is even a streamlined Friendly indicator on your hud, its a lil hard to see who is who unless someone is the SL - you'll be following green dots til you find your buddies. It would be cool if you could assign a symbol to say 4 of the other 8 in a squad, or even any player on your team... OH but I'm not a Vet, sorry Squad.\n- The sounds are good, even if it is a little ridiculous that in pairs of gaming headsets my buddies and I can't tell where the shots are originating from always. Usually wide open areas at 100-200m and closer. My buddies who agree ARE Vets for what that's worth Squad. The sound is a great start - just needs more fleshing out.\n- The maps are cool and interesting. It feels like there are some places that we don't get to fight, but overall it is a huge environment every game, and even one or two variants of a small CQB/MOUT type environment that I personally f*cking LOVE. The piles of rubble and busted walls look very good, the whole map, every map, is awesome. Except the rare exploit spot and hidaway - the Terrain work is great.\n- Weapons are effective, no one is a bulletsponge.\n...\nRant over guys. Hopefully you can see that I've played this game enough to share some insight - and that what I've shared here helps you decide if the game is worth the price to you or not.","May 10","false","48.5"," 90 of 155 people (58%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","58","90","155","10","15"

Glancing to my left and right are my squad mates who crouched beside me, quickly acknowledge what I'm seeing. Off in the distance, the chattering of fire reverberates up the valley capping off with the frantic, paniced report from my fellow squad lead that his guys are under heavy fire and pushing the objective. I acknowledge and inform my guys what our teammates are into. My Grenadier pipes up, "Squad Lead, are we gonna move to them?" he says. "We are, we need to take this next ridge to assist 2nd Squad and take the objective." I say. At that precise moment, the sharp crack of a bullet wizzes over us. "CONTACT! 100 meters 12 o'clock!" half my squad rings out. "AR open up!!!" I yell. It becomes a light show, tracers wizzing back and forth frantic screaming and explosions.\n\nAll of it COMPLETELY unscripted. All of it ENTIRELY new every time. Prepare to see true The thrill of trying to outsmart and exchanging fire with another coordinated team of actual people, where your decisions have consequences on the battlefield whether you know it or not, and the most coordinated and team oriented side wins, is what Squad is. Not to mention breaking ALL examples of what people thing Early Access is. This game, community, and Dev team are second to none.

In it's current state and at the current price I couldn't justify recommending to anyone.\n\nLet me say though - the premise is a great one. Teamwork to the fore as you and your fellow squads work to secure objectives and eliminate the enemy. Some great features like fantastic ingame proximity VOIP really serve to emphasise the teamwork vision the developers have for the game.\n\nAdditionally there are no KDR's (Kill Death Ratios), the scoreboard works on a points system so whilst you can see who has contributed the most points on your team it is clear that the focus isn't on the lone wolf soldier just gunning for the best KDR. Here is where the game first comes unstuck, you have no idea who actually killed you - is it the enemy from 300m away or is the the guy team killing on your own team.\n\nAnd that is a nice summary of where the game is currently at. The idea and vision are great, execution is badly lacking. Given the game is Early Access then I have some tolerance for bugs, but this game desperately needs some quality of life features, even at the expense of a little realism (and let's face it a medic reviving someone who is dead and they go straight back into battle is hardly realistic anyway). Currently at the moment hacking seems to be a real issue as well, which to their credit, the devs acknowledge, but the announced partnership with easy anti-cheat doesn't fill me with confidence.\n\nThrow in the almost AAA price tag for a EA niche game and there is just too much going against this to recommend at the moment. Unless you are an absolute die hard fan, I recommend sitting on the fence and see how this one develops over time.\n\nThe Good:\nThe idea and vision to emphasise teamwork over the individual\nInnovative gameplay\nInbuilt VOIP works great\n\nThe Bad:\nSome real quality of life improvements are needed to enahance gameplay, even at the expense of some realism\nBugs (to be expected with EA but you will need some patience)\nMajor content still coming (i.e. vehicles)\n\nThe Ugly:\nHackers can be a problem on servers\nGriefers are a major issue if no active admin\nGame currently does not warrant AAA price tag\n\nOverall Score:\n5/10","January 5","false","1.8"," 126 of 224 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","126","224","7","0"

Since before I knew it existed.\n\nI like games like Hostile Intent, Insurgency, Arma, etc. I enjoy more casual games like the Battlefield series, but let's be honest, I prefer games that are more realistic and punishing.\n\nSquad is like taking the best things of Insurgency, Arma, and the Battefield series, combining them, improving them, and then adding to them.\n\nThe maps are large, to say the least. The terrain is excellent, and still being improved.\n\nWeapons are fantastic. Iron sights and limited scopes currently. Very well balanced, and they hit hard. No ammo counter or magically refilling magazines.\n\nWhen you get critically hit you start bleeding out and need to bandage, or find a medic. Medics can pick you up from being downed, but it takes time, and after being downed twice, you won't be picked up again, you have to respawn. Just one of many game mechanics that I feel really balances things out. You can't be revived 37 times in a row by a medic sitting behind the wall reviving you over and over.\n\n9 man squads are well balanced. You can't make a new squad to get the one sniper class or rpg. As more people join your squad, the rest of the classes are unlocked, to make sure every squad is balanced.\n\nYou can communicate to your own squad anywhere on the map, and in direct chat you can communicate with other friendlies from other squads. It's very well done. The in game voice quality is the best of any game I've ever played.\n\nSquad leaders can communicate with other squad leaders via a 3rd voice chat option to coordinate attacks/defense/assistance.\n\nSquad leaders, when near 1 friendly player, can drop a rally point, where their own squad members can spawn. It only has 9 spawn points, and you can only place 1 every 2 minutes. If an enemy gets near it it goes away.\n\nSquad leaders can also build FOBs, where any player on your team can spawn, and there is no limit to spawns. You spawn faster at fobs than rally's. Your squad leader can design defensive structures to secure your fob, and the other players have to get out their shovels and build what the squad leader designed.\n\nFOB building is very well done, in that it takes time, resources, and teamwork to build, and they can only be build a certain distance apart, so you don't end up with teams having 20 spawn points all over the map. On a good team you generally will see maybe 2 FOBs, possibly 3. Again every aspect of the game seems very well balanced, and it's still in its infancy.\n\nThis game is amazing as it is, and it doesn't even have land or air vehicles yet. It's constantly being updated and worked on. It's only getting better.\n\nYou haven't played a great large scale realistic FPS until you've tried Squad.","December 26, 2015","true","36.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brynwalker1/recommended/393380/","brynwalker1","DoctorFresh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brynwalker1/","180 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTLDR, buy Squad if you\n\n- Like slow paced gameplay compared to something like Battlefield, but faced paced gameplay compared to Arma\n- Enjoy really working in a team. Like, REALLY. You MUST work well with your team if you want to win\n- Enjoy playing a variety of distinct roles\n- Like longer shooter match lengths\n- Enjoy a combination of strategy and action\n- If you're a social gamer (not as necessary, you can get by without being massively talkative, but a mic is still an absolute must)\n\nAvoid it if you\n\n- Don't have a mic (seriously, just get one, they're cheap as chips)\n- Want a large variety of game modes\n- Want shoot-em-up action all the time\n- Have little patience\n- Don't like taking directions/advice from other players\n- Want to lone-wolf/do your own thing\n- Have an AMD CPU. There are some serious Unreal Engine issues plaguing AMD users right now. Probably avoid Squad until they iron them out.\n\nBefore I dive into my actual review, I want to mention that I've played over 500 hours of Arma 3, and that that's where the majority of my shooter experience comes from. I've also played a decent chunk of Project Reality, the BF2 mod that Squad is based on. In my opinion, Squad is a far superior game to Arma 3, and even though they both scratch different itches and are very different games, Squad is probably going to be my go to tactical/'realistic' shooter for at least the next 2 years.\n\nSquad isn't the first game to do what it's doing. If you've played Project Reality (and if you haven't, I really recommend it before buying Squad, it's free) you've basically played Squad with vehicles and dated graphics. However, it does do what it sets out to do extremely well.\n\nA lot of reviewers have described Squad as being 'slow-paced' and while there's some truth to that, I would put it a different way. Squad has a fair bit of down time where you're just walking between objectives, chatting and dropping banter with your squadmates. When you're actually engaged in a firefight, there's nothing slow paced about Squad at all. You're constantly forced to make micro decisions that could lead to your entire squad being wiped out if you screw up, especially if you're playing a vital role such as medic or squad leader.\n\nUltimately what Squad comes down to is the effectiveness of squad leaders and how well they can utilise their squad members' abilities. A single fantastic squad can turn the tide of a seemingly hopeless round, and this happens quite often. This means that even the currently winning team's squad leaders have to be really switched on and constantly on the lookout for game making plays from other squads. Understanding how the maps flow is pretty key to this. I won't talk about how to squad lead specifically, but a great squad leader can literally win the game for you. It doesn't matter if you've got 50 amazing marksmen on your team if there's no one to coordinate them into killing as many of the baddies as possible.\n\nThe gunplay is extremely satisfying and has a lot of really impressive visual and audio feedback. Full auto, or even burst fire is only really viable on the AK model weapons. The M16 and M4 simply recoil too much to be effective on full auto at anything over about 20 metres. The US weapons do come with pretty great optics though, which means that the US team will usually try to engage at longer ranges, while Insurgents will attempt to sneak up closer. This lends a pretty interesting assymetric balance to firefights.\n\nThe audio in this game is almost on par with something like DICE's Battefield 4 or Battlefront. It's seriously impressive and actually pretty important to your survivability. Tracing where gunshots came from, or listening to an enemy fireteam run through the field you're lying in informs all those micro decisions you're constantly making. The visuals are pretty much what you'd expect too, with some nice lighting effects and some really atmospheric and immersive vistas on some of the maps. Could probably use a bit more polish, but nothing to complain about really.\n\nI could talk loads more about this game, but if any of what I said sounds interesting to you, go try out Project Reality. If you like that, get Squad. They're different, especially since Squad doesn't have vehicles yet, but they scratch the same itch. Some of the most tense and satisfying gaming moments I've had have been in Squad.\n\nI'll update this review as the game gets patched.","March 17","true","84.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Although this game is currently in the early stages of the development cycle it definitely delivers solid gameplay mechanics and visuals. The flow of the game is great. It's not perfect but with every single update it gets better and better - a vital sign of the developers listening to community feedback and improving on their previous releases.\n\nOne of my favourite aspects of SQUAD is that this game is intense, and I truly mean intense. Whether you're in a small server with 5 players on each team or in the huge cluster of chaos that is a 50v50 player warzone.. you're going to experience exactly what the developers are working to achieve - capturing combat realism through communication and team play (and this is currently with just infantry based combat.. vehicles (transports, logistics, APCs / IFVs, helos...) improvement / additions to gameplay mechanics are going to multiply this intensity). Ever watch one those deployment videos from Iraq, Afghanistan or Eastern Ukraine? One second you're strolling to an objective and the next SHTF and you're engaged in a 15 minute long firefight with the enemy players.\n\nAll in all..SQUAD is by FAR one of the best shooters I've played and is a prime example of a game made by developers that get engaged in playing side by side with their community. If you're looking to experience a game that will deliver both as a solid title AND be a stellar example of an ongoing game in development.. say no more.\n\nThis game certainly has a long way to go and there are regular news updates and posts on hotfixes / noted issues but with a little bit of time and the great supportive community it will be way more than any Project Reality vet could have imagined and will definitely be the go to title for players that enjoy gaming in tight knit squads, large maps, immersive engagements and atmospheric environments.","December 15, 2015","true","122.2"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","23","35","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/biznit/recommended/393380/","biznit","Ryan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/biznit/","280 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEver since the Xbox 360 shipped with a headset packaged as standard, online games have yearned to create the kind of cooperative multiplayer seen only in advertisements and well-rehearsed E3 demos.\n\nOutside of these scripted environments very few games have put emphasis on voice chat. Sure, we’ve had games like those in the SOCOM series and MAG which have tried to varying degrees of success but the simple truth is that outside a certain genre of game, voice chat just isn’t used. Hell, even in the most competitive games out there today it’s rare to find people using voice chat.\n\nSquad, on the other hand, is one of the few games which seems to be doing voice chat right. Boot up Squad today and within a few minutes you’ll have a voice telling you where to go and what to do. If taking orders isn’t your thing you can be that voice telling others where to go and what to do. It’s actually very close to what MAG was trying to do, except it’s on a platform where people actually have microphones. You also probably won’t have to worry about servers shutting off making the game unplayable. Even though it’s still in an alpha state, Squad has a thriving active community of players. If anything about MAG sounded appealing to you, Squad is the game that actually delivers on those ideas.\n\nThe developers behind Squad started out making a relatively popular mod for Battlefield 2 called Project Reality. Project reality built upon Battlefield 2 adding new levels of realism and a vastly increased scope. It looked better, it played better, its custom-made maps spanned dozens of kilometers. It’s one of the best fan mods out there today. It seems that all of this experience has translated perfectly into Squad with its vast maps and team-focused gameplay.\n\nSquad is unique in that in can take minutes to get to anything resembling action but good leadership will ensure you’re never out of the fray for too long. It’s as if someone took an objective-based first person shooter like Battlefield and added the massive scale and openness of DayZ. As a result Squad it definitely a game you’ll enjoy more if you’re playing with a group of people you know. That’s not to say you can’t have fun alone but just like in other games where communication plays a key role – like Trouble in Terrorist Town – you’re going to have more fun after you and the people you’re playing with have built up a rapport.\n\nIt’s hard to be too critical of Squad because it’s still in active development but what I can say is that the gameplay feels extremely solid. Most of the things that need to be improved before the commercial release are related to the UI and tutorials because as a new player it can be very difficult to know what you should do which becomes a very intimidating problem, especially when other people are relying on you to perform your role.\n\nUnlike most early access games, Squad actually offers a fun playable experience. If you’re on the fence about spending the money, maybe wait until the official release but if you’re excited to play right now, it’s well worth the price.","March 13","true","2.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

Rodeo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erodeo/","154 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlright, this game is the real deal. I've been looking for a game like this for a long time. Ever since seeing Dyslexci's Arma 3 videos on the Shack Tac Youtube channel, I've been looking to get more into Milsim games. I'm just not the kinda guy to join a clan though, and without one, Arma 3 is not at all like those amazing videos you see online.\n\nSquad though... This is it. You don't need a clan with mandatory attendence, you don't need to spend 10 hours creating a mission, you don't even need friends. Join a server, pick a squad, you're in. Suddenly, you're in a massive battlefield with multiple squads working together, with people actually talking to each other. Your squad leader will guide you, tell you what the squad is currently up to. Maybe defending a FOB (player-created secondary objective), maybe coordinating with another 9-person squad to flank an enemy position atop a fortified hill... For the first time, I actuallty felt like I was in a Dyslexci video.\n\nAfter a round, you kind of feel like you got to know your squad a little. Leaders have different styles, making games very different. You've got your roleplay-heavy medic screaming at you to hang on, that he's coming for you, as frags go off left and right. You've got the guy yelling about the glory of Chechnya. I feel a little  sad to see a good squad break up after a game.\n\nOverall, this game looks incredibly promising. Solid Milsim action that is very easy to get into yet seems incredibly hard to master.\n\nDisclaimer, you need a mic to play this game.

Squad is something special.  It sores very high while it’s flying, and perhaps falters ever so slightly when it’s not, mostly due to other people.  The development team has laid out a yellow brick road that seems to be on track.  Make no mistake, if you have hungered for something real, something tactical and representative of intense visceral infantry (and perhaps in the future, vehicular) combat, this is that game.\n\nThe genius of squad lays in what it creates.  Emergent, medium scale infantry combat based around team play.  Switching weapons takes a bit of time, as does preparing a grenade or smoke grenade to throw.  Moving is not very quick.  These are all good things, because it creates an environment where you need to think before you act.  It really isn't that hard to understand what this game is about.  Think of an instance that countless people have shared and that seems to be the staple of amazing moments in Squad.  You and your 8 person squad is moving to an objective on a map that represents a few square miles (they are big map).  You have a general idea of where you’ll meet the enemy, but there are no guarantees. It seems slow.  You all decide to stop and drop a rally point.  You here a hiss of bullet cross your plane past you nearby.  There's no 'snap' so you know it’s not exactly on you, but it’s nearby.  Maybe you hear a few more hissing bullets scream by, and then a snap.  You hit "B" to engage squad comm's and begin to tell your squad you think you’re being shot at.  An explosion of gun fire erupts, everyone’s on comms screaming, all hell breaks loose, your SAW gunner starts unloading in hopefully the right direction.  You and your squad are frantically trying to communicate where the fire is coming from.  You notice your rocketeer launch an RPG, and for a moment are dazzled by the beautiful animation of the back blast before you get your head back in the game.  Smoke is being deployed ahead of you to cover your retreat.  The other side launches a rocket and decimates your squad.  It’s all over.  And it all took maybe 3-5 seconds.  That, at its core, is squad.\nThe audio is a dream.  The graphics are absolutely gorgeous (although this is the only department I can think of where EA is really apparent.  The anti-aliasing is not finished, so some maps in the desert with lots of shrubs look rather gross atm).  For the most part, if you land in a good squad, you'll have a great time.  If you land in a bad squad, you may need to switch squads or teams.  Sometimes you need to find a new server altogether.  You may waste 10 minutes doing so until you get in a good server with a communicative squad.  But once you do, you're in for an amazing ride.\nLet’s address some of the cons, and if you follow the forums you may have been misled into believing there are a host of problems without realizing there mostly client side.\n\n1. My game runs like crap/balls/low fps etc.:  This is primarily people running old computers.  I upgraded (spent $400) recently on an i3 6100, gtx 950 and 4 gigs of ddr4 ram, and this game runs like an absolute dream.  Go to twitch, watch people play.  It runs absolutely amazing.  Bugs are not very prevalent.  Your windows is not fully updated, and before running updater and installing all of the updates you decided to get on the forums and start b*******?  Well that’s your problem.  BUT, you’re REALLY lucky that the community is so amazing that people are going to help you.  No one is going to troll you, and rarely do people get on your case about not using the search function if you're sincere.\n(One small side note, if you’re running an AMD cpu you may get mixed results.  I don't know much about it since I'm luckily running an intel cpu, but I've seen and heard people with AMD's are able to run this game).  The point of this paragraph is to set the record straight.  This game is VERY well optimized at this time if you have a decent rig.  If you're running a potato, then either upgrade or wait for more updates.\n\n2. "Peoples suck and I can't play with a good team" bla bla bla.  Right, just leave your squad and find another one.  Switch teams and repeat.  Still no good, leave the server and do it again. Maybe you lose 10 minutes of your time.  If that’s unacceptable to you and you can't invest a small amount of time to have a great experience, then I think COD is going to be on sale this week, it’s that way _______>\n\nAlmost every issue is resolvable thanks to the amazing community that is Squad.  That community involves the developers who are extremely active on the joinsquad.com forums, redit, and twitter.  I avoid the steam forums bc it’s mostly COD people who try this game out for 20 minutes and begin complaining.\n\nIs this game for me?\nGreat question, let’s see if we can get that sorted out for you.  Are you mature minded?  Are you patient?  Does the idea of brief moments of intense fighting interspersed with moments of boredom as you walk large distances and communicate with your squad excite you?  Are you okay using a mic and having real living people listen to your voice and talk back to you okay with you?  Maybe this games for you.\n\nOn the other hand.  Do you think COD is the best thing since sliced bread?  Do you frequently get into arguments with people on forums even though your right and he is wrong?  Is it other people’s fault that you died and your team sucks?  Move on, COD is your game.\n\nThis is an experience that will be remembered for a long time because it does what so many of us have yearned for for the first time.  Take a risk and you may find yourself having a lot of fun.  Or maybe you hate it.  It is well worth the risk to try it out.","March 1","true","99.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It is a no holds bar arenaline fuel ride when the action gets going.   While it isn't a milsim, don't let that fool you in thinking it isn't realistic.  There are gameplay choices made to keep the flow going if you are a clever squad leader.\n\nThe sounds in this game are, in the opinion of this former grunt, second to none in terms of realism.  Rounds flying by give you an audible snap, crack, and whiz.  During fire fights you'll find yourself yelling on the mic.  Not just because guns and explosions are louder than hell, but also because your adrenaline is pumping.\n\nThat's the joy of this game.  Everything in this game so far offers easy access for players to work as a team.  There are 3 separate team channels.  Local for everyone on your team that is near you to speak with.  Squad, which has no range limit, to speak with everyone on your team, and Squad Leader which is used for the Squad Leaders to speak amongst each other and plan their next move.\n\nThe strength of this game is also inherently its weakness.  If you don't use a mic, you're drastically reducing your squad's effectiveness.  While a well communicating squad can make for some of the most intense and exciting gameplay?  A muted squad of lone wolves will absolutely make you want to quit the game.\n\nSo far there is only infantry combat, with the devs saying vehicles will comes soon (HMMWVs, Technicals, Dirt Bikes, MTLB's, etc) but for just the infantry portion the gameplay is solid.  I can only see the game getting better and better when more assets are added.\n\nAnd that's another thing: the developers.  They play this game as much as the players do.  Before this game went live on Steam, I found myself smoking and joking with the dev team members in game.  They want this game to be just as awesome as we do.  They are very active on the forums and sub-reddit, answering plenty of questions and giving us little sneak peeks on what they're working on.  It's a breath of fresh air for sure.\n\n\nI'll put it like this.  Do you want a tactical shooter with open terrain, exciting combat, strategy and depth?  This is the game.  Not super realistic like ArmA but not arcadey like Call of Duty.  It has great flow, great atmosphere, I can't recommend it enough.","December 19, 2015","true","66.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

You follow the orders of the SLs and must constantly keep an eye open to enemies and your teammates.\nWhere is everyone? What is the optimal position to hold? Where is the SL? Are my teammates ok? These are all questions you keep asking yourself throughout the game. Stick to the squad because you DON'T want to get killed. Medics already have plenty to do and you don't want to be that guy who has to walk half the map to find a weakened squad. You are just a troop following orders being constantly fully aware of the surroundings. That's it.\nI purchased this game in January 2016 when it still was and is in Alpha. Yet this game has so much potential, for reasons I will explain.\nThe concept\nYou follow your role and stick to it. You always follow the orders. This could be holding a base, helping other teams, etc. The goal is to, I think, to conquer as much of the map as possible.\nThe game itself\nThe game itself is relatively demanding on hardware for the graphics it carries, but it should be acceptable. Don't expect anything too fancy (yet). I haven't played many games but the level of realism in the maps is a bit better than Far Cry. The player interactions are proper.\nCommunication is something this game has a great focus on, having implemented somewhat realistic means of voice chat. You can call teammates and squad leaders and troops in a 20 m radius, which is pretty neat. Also good chat implementation.\nI don't know what's up with the servers but they're always full so you'll have to choose a server far away with high ping. The people are very kind and don't yell at you, which is what you also shouldn't do. Given the complexity of the game and the amount of awareness needed to play it, you should understand that you aren't the center of attention even if you are the top fragger who just got killed. You deal with it as a group where the ambiance is a factor as well. This is probably why I love the game the most.\nConclusion\nThe game has extremely lots of potential. If you have the money and find it very interesting, buy it. You will find yourself playing it for many hours. Otherwise just wait until it's out.\n\nPEOPLE WITH AMD WILL SUFFER EXTREME LAGS, WILL BE FIXED SOON\n\nConcept 10/10\nGraphics 7/10 (for now)\nGameplay 10/10","January 9","true","7.6"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","14","20","3","0"

Inside the squad there are roles that included  medics (that can first aid and save a wounded soldier,)  or machine gunner, rifle man, sniper, bazooka, and squad leader . well you can also build where ever squad decide some barricades... bunker and much more.   Its a very fun and professional game, its a kind of mix between arma 3 and isurgency.   Also the maps are so big, the audio effects are so realistic.

Do you like realistic shooters? SQUAD may be for you.\n\nThe maps are large and and the terrain is very varied, so this is not a run and gun game. A microphone I would truly recommend if you want to experience the game fully. Coordinating with a squad is fun as hell and makes you feel like you're part of an outfit. Being the squad leader is also a important position, because you need those forward operating bases in order to help your team spawns. Excellent FOBs can certainly win a game for you, so its not all about your aim.\n\nThe game has squad voice chat, and even local directional voice chat, so if there's a teammate calling for help or pointing out a target, he could just use the local voice chat to warn nearby teammates. Its an awesome feature.\n\nI have complete faith in the developers to pull this off. They've added so much in the alpha builds and I can't wait to see the future vehicles and features.\n\nPerformance wise: I have a GTX 770, and a i7 3770K and the game runs at a mixture of high/epic settings around 50 FPS at 1080p for me. The game uses Unreal Engine 4.\n\nIf there's any Project Reality (BF2 mod) players reading this, SQUAD is definitely most similar to PR in my opinion.","December 15, 2015","true","25.5"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

Arma 3 still getting crap framerates?  Want realistic warfare simulation?  This is the game for you.  My group of friends and I have been searching (longing) for an experience we first had in a mod, called Red Orchestra.  Originally a mod for Unreal 2003 engine.  RO, the mod created an experience unlike any other.  You'd fight for hours upon hours.  Each life feeling like it could be your last as your reinforcements drained away.  It actually felt like the people you fought with were your Band of Brothers.  So much so, that till this day, over 10 years later, we still are that Band of Brothers.\n\nThe devs of RO took the game into retail, slightly increasing it's small dedicated community.  The retail version, while still good, was not the equal of the mod.  Eventually after years of promise, and diversions to other games, the devs returned with RO 2.  With it's return, the devs forgot and neglected the hard-core fan base.  They ignored suggestions during alpha and beta testing.  All in hopes of attracting more from the COD and BF crowd.  In the end they pleased no one.  They sold their souls for the almighty dollar and got nothing in return.\n\nFinally Squad has come.   Squad incorporates the feeling of small unit tactics (squad of up to 9 playes), into a larger battlefield (servers range from 30 players on up to 72).   You feel like you are taking part in a battle.  Maybe you have a few minutes of quiet while marching to the objective.  Then suddenly all hell breaks loose and someone screams "who's doing the SHOOTING!" .  Bullets whiz by your head.  You drop to the ground, frantically trying to figure where the gunfire is coming from.  Your squad mates are dropping like flies around you.  You grab your med pack and try to put some of your buddies back into the fight.  Then all goes black and you start screaming MEDIC!\n\nIf you are looking for something more than running around a small map and twitch shooting the first guy you see, then this is the game for you.  If you want to feel that the teams success depends on you and your squad mates.  Then this is the game for you.  If you want to have fun with friends or make friends for a lifetime.  Then Squad is the game for you.  Enough already.  Get SQUAD!\n\n\nP.S.  Tripwire, this is the game you wish you made.\n\nP.S.S.

I've been playing the game since its early Closed Alpha up until release, and when I say it's one of the best shooters I've ever played, I mean that sincerely. It finds this level of realism that feels incredibly authentic, even up against other notable titles in its genre.\n\nCommunication is paramount for success. A microphone is strongly recommended. In-game comms shapes the experience in a way that is unmatched by any other shooter I have played, and is what helps to deliver that authentic experience. Join a squad, pick a role, listen to your squad leader, work as a team, and you'll come out on top.

The squad leader orders me to stay back and support them with my scoped sniper rifle. While I am watching the roofs I hear a shot behind me. I immediately drop to prone and check the map. Nothing is showing up where I am, and that can only mean enemies. Thankfully I had positioned myself in a waist high poppy field so there is no way they can see me. The thing is though I can see them through the stalks of the flowers running by me. They also must have shot at someone else because they have no clue I am there. What the enemy squad thought was a great flanking route to take on my squad has now turned into their worst nightmare. As they approached me  I radio in my position to the squad leader and let him know of the situation. He cannot spare anyone to come back and aid me, so now it is up to me to keep them occupied. They run past and with their backs to me I get in the kneeled position and shoot two of them dead. I get prone and slink off to their right while they toss grenades into the field. I take no damage. They knew the shots were close but they do not know where I went. Their medic tries to go and revive one of the soldiers and I shoot him dead. They were a smaller squad of seven so I had just killed their only medic. Now I have effectively stalled their attack because there are only four of them left with no way to revive. They toss another grenade and miss again. I'm wishing now that I could hear their radio chatter because I am sure they freaking out trying to locate me. I slowly snaked up to the wall of the field and looked on the other side. I see two more and I take them out, but I get hit in the process and I go down. Moments later the last two are killed as my squad had taken the compound and had returned to aid me. Our medic revives me and I recieve verbal praise from my squad as we go back to occupy the control point.\n\n10/10 Would save the day again.","January 24","true","38.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Now imagine Battlefield 4 and ARMA III had a baby.

This game is for people that like real time tactical gameplay that is all about teamwork (squad) rather than your average FPS run and gun game, in order to win in this game you have to have a plan and also be able to exicute that plan with your team and the squads within that team.  The deployables and base biulding is a amazing part of the game. This is a one of a kind game and should not be thought of as a ARMA like game because it is very different from ARMA in many ways. I will update this review as i get further into the game and as updates are released. The game runs great for me but some servers are a bit laggy, as long as you select a good server to join and adjust the settings to what your PC can run without problems, there are some times while in brush or high amounts of deployables where you will have a FPS drop but i have been able to play without lag (on the correct servers). I highly reccomend buying this game if you want the expiereince of real war and fire fights, there is not a game that comes close to Squad as far as realism. BUY IT.

I first started with Halo, BF2/3, COD, MW1-3, etc.....even ventured into the world of Uncharted 1-3 and thoroughly enjoyed it that is until that one fateful day last summer when I was watching a Project Reality livestream and heard the players discussing a new tactical FPS called Squad.  I was intrigued to say the least so much so that I built my first gaming PC solely for the purpose of playing Squad.  I can honestly say that I enjoy the game so much that not only do I play it every day of the week, but I actually lose sleep daily to play this game, because I set an alarm to wake me up three hours before work just to play - that's how addictive this game is!!  And for someone like me with no PC FPS gaming experience to come in literally blind and pick up the strategies and game play in a matter of a few hours is testimony enough for any person that has a competitive FPS bone in their body.

Not only did they want to bring to life a new iteration of a game we all played and loved (Project Reality), they wanted to do it their way, which meant trying to achieve a relatively transparent dev. process, and do away with the trust issues we all have from early access games. Squad is in an Alpha stage of development that would pass for a complete game by the standards other EA games have set in the last few years. On top of these things theyre also on the way to achieving the rush that only people who truly played Project Reality could get, when you value youre game life enough to actually have your heart skip a beat, and you get to see how you really react under the stress of fire. Something i find very tough to explain, but you will know once you play SQUAD.\n\nThe GOOD:\n-High quality audio, textures, models, and effects. seriously you can just sit and watch a  firefight and still get a rush\n-Accurate models and factions with proper equipment. A must for vets and military nerds alike!\n-In-game VOIP allows a level of communication not seen in other FPS's. you can talk to people near you with positional audio, or you can talk to another Squad Leader across the map.\n-Speaking of maps. even without pushing the engine to its limits the maps are HUGE compared to alot of FPS's. im not talking ARMA scale, but 4kmx4km will give you plenty of flanking room.\n-Very few gamey elements. A big part of the idea of SQUAD is that you should be able to get easily immersed. Your enemies dont pop up as red dots anywhere, the only way you can know where the enemy is is by communicating with other team-mates, or walk towards the gunfire.\n-Buildable FOBS! this is one of the things brought over from PR, and with the new engine it is just awesome! You can make your own objectives within a game. Stuck in a stalemate, or just dont like the flag you have to attack? Build a giant fortress at the top of the hill and make the enemy come to you!\n-Medic System. If you get wounded, you dont just wait 3 seconds and spawn on your squad leader. in SQUAD you rely on a medic to heal you even if youve been dropped, he first has to bandage your wounds, then heal you, then you can get back in the fight. the system is still being worked on all the time but it is already a nice mechanic, and the long spawn or walk times to get back to your squad are a good incentive to keep the squad together and keep your medic safe!\n\nThe BAD:\n-Game pretty much requires a microphone to get the most out of it, you can get pretty cheap mics, but some people cant be screaming at insurgents all night while their baby/family sleeps. an unfortunate problem.\n-Performance issues. Incase youve forgot at this point, this game is still in ALPHA, theres gonna be problems. the devs work constantly to resolve these problems. dont freak out because you cant play, go to the forums and report it and it will be fixed sooner :).\n-Bugs. again from the above point, ALPHA. there are still some bugs to flesh out, none of the major bugs are game breaking so it shouldnt be a point against buying the game, just report them when you find them!\n\nConclusion:\nIf you're looking for more out of your FPS experience, if you get frustrated by the stupidity you see in other games, if you just need to blow something up, join us in SQUAD. It's like if ARMA and Insurgency got freaky, and then their baby got raised by Project Reality.

It's one of the best milsim FPS games out there in my opinion. They are constantly working on the game, and are really there for the players. They are working very hard on their game and really take pride in it. Squad has great potential, and it will be a great game when it's finished (whenever that may be)\n\nHowever, there are, as you probably already figured, also a lot of cons. I could make a whole list of them, but I won't, since I really like the game, and the developers. There are a couple of things that have to be mentioned before you buy though;\n\n- Know that you're buying an Early Access game, this game, as you know, is far, and I mean really, really far from finished. After all this time its been open for the public you'd say it has quite a lot of content, and they would've managed to fix a lot of bugs, but that is not the case. There is not a huge amount of content, and there is also quite an amount of bugs (nothing gamebreaking though).\n- There are no vehicles yet. They just released an update which adds the base of the vehicle system, which is enterable stationary machine guns. This is a huge leap forward, and is great to see. The system they want to be using for the vehicles is just not finished yet. (They've done tests on public servers with vehicles, and that lead to huge problems, both server-sided, and client-sided.\n- The optimisation for this game is terrible. The game is so badly optimised, that when you're in a poppy field, you will get a huge fps drop in most cases. Of course this differs from the computer you're using, but it's most likely that even though you have a big fancy gaming pc, you will still get fps drops. I personally think that they should focus on making the game run better, before adding more content (like vehicles). This is the main reason why I haven't been playing Squad that much lately.\n\nNow of course I get viewed upon as a very negative person, who only sees the negative points about things. But please don't think that way. I love this game, it is, as I said, one of the best milsim shooters out there. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes these kinds of games. I always say it is a fair mix of Arma and Battlefield, where there is huge battlefields and fights, but with a fair amount of realism in it. This is great if you ask me. Also, the community of this game is great (at least, the people I came across). There's so many people who are nice, and actually communicate with other squad leaders and of course their own squads, that is a great thing to see, as you don't see that in most games, I also came across a lot of people who are hilarious as hell, saying all kinds of things in their mics. And the last thing I want to say is about the developers, they are great. Almost every month they release a huge update with both new content, and fixes. They are busy with their game day in day out, and that is great. Also they carefully respond to questions on their forums and on reddit, which is also a great thing.\n\nSo should you get this game? Yes, if you like these kinds of games, and are willing to live with the things I listed, then just buy it. The price might seem a bit much, but just see it as an investment, you will have an even more amazing game when its finished. If you are still hesitating to buy it, then just follow Squad for a while, the updates will pop up in your Activity page on Steam. That way you can see what happens with the game, and what they are up to.","May 30","true","84.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

Trump. Americans got destroyed.\n10/10 This game can tell the future.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nJokes aside, ONLY GET THIS GAME IF YOU ARE WILLING TO GET ALL TACTICAL\n\nFirst up, this game is going to force you to play together. The maps are huge, and you will need to stick together with your squad. Set up rally points, build FOBs, anyrhing that you can fall back on when you go down. No one wants to walk kilometers from their main base to get to the frontlines. Long respawn timers increase based on how many teammates you've killed, how fast you gave up without waiting for a medic, and how fast you've died after respawning. You want to make sure you are with a nearby medic, so as I just said, stay close.\n\nNext, this game is going to be tough and infuriating. Death will come from places you will never expect, and you are definitely going to bleed out and get knocked out even as you think you are safe under those bushes. Adjust your mentality as you get into this game, realise that kills don't mean ♥♥♥♥, that deaths and respawn waste your team's tickets, and adjust your playstyle. Listen to your leader, play the objectives and focus on supporting your squadmates.\n\nThis game is a mix between Insurgency and ArmA, with the intensity of Insurgency's close quarter environments and the scale of ArmA's map. Find Insurgency too fast-paced? Find ArmA too slow and buggy?

The in game browser often won't refresh new servers. Server lists are often incomplete and have no region filtering options. There is no join IP console command. The steam friends list join function is broken. A more reliable webpage based server browser is available but it works by launching the game to join a server (which means you can't use it when the game is already running.)\n\nTrying to get a small group of friends into the same server takes more effort than it should.\n\nThe game itself is great, and looks to be shaping up as a fine successor to Project Reality. However it currently doesn't have much content, and there's plenty of small frustrations that can kill the experience; uninterruptible animations, climbing/stamina system, buggy user placed spawns etc.\n\nThough the worst thing right now is probably the community.\nThere are way too many people who try to play before learning the basic mechanics, "minecrafters", people who bought Arma3 to play Altis Life, and of course with any "Milsim" game there is a fair number of junior ROTC bootlicking airsofters that are just itching to order around civillians.\n\nUnless you have a massive love for Project Reality mod, right now this probably isn't the game for you.\nIf you're curious, I'd honestly tell you to wait until this gets more polish and until the user base gets filtered out by attrition. The game has slowly been improving, and I'm eager to see if polish up these issues.","December 23, 2015","false","83.8"," 32 of 58 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","32","58","3","4"

Likely chances of you capturing a base by yourself is nill; work together and observe the battle acitvely to take points and aid eachother with cover fire or medical aid. Medics btw, require you to first "bandage" someone once they've been shot or taken down, at which you can then proceed to using a medical bag to restore the rest of the individuals health; it is a two step process. There is also the factor, that when someone is taken down (and is no longer a threat) they are still alive and can be revived by a medic, as long as the person was not shot in the head. A medical emblem will be easily seen above those on your team who can be revived.\n\n2) Weapon Customization is limited at the current time and only few weapons are given to each squad position. There are only a few attachments for each weapon (but, they are still being added with each update). The last recent update included new acogs and other attachments for select weapons; due note, this game does not allow you to share attachments on other weapons... Weapons, as well as their attachment choices are squad position dependant.\n\n3) Some squad positions (such as the sniper), do not become availible for a squad choice until a given amount of members have filled a squad; this leaves the sniper position locked and unavailible until at least the 4-6 person is added. This makes it nearly impossible to attain the sniper position on purpose; getting the sniper is only likely to be availible once you've joined an active squad which is nearly full, and you get lucky to see the position unused. I've always enjoyed rifles and long range sniper battles...But, be warned; this game intentionally attempts to limit sniper use due to maps being very open.. this could maybe change in the future, but at this time it seems to be a set feature. Snipers also use a smaller acog, instead of a medium or long range scope.\n\n4) At this given time of writing this review, the beta still currently does not have vehicles. Maps are very large, and walking distances are beyond boring. To make it worse; your character has stamina, which you must pay extra careful attention to so you can have enough to accurately aim and fire your weapon with percision when needed. When running from behind one cover to the next, you will lose your stamina almost entirely. Stamina is also regained slower than most other FPS titles...; you will have to literally sit and guard your position until you can continue running. Is it realistic? Maybe... But in real life, there is also troop transports and humvees... Which for both, Squad devs have clearly shown pictures and videos displaying humvess and transports which are in the mix for future updates. Right now though, running sucks, so be warned.\n\n5) To spawn at any other location which does not include a captured enemies FOB, the squad leader must (with the proximity of other squad mates) create a spawn FOB or rally point so you don't have to walk all the way from base to the next objective. To create a FOB or rally point, squad mates from your squad must collect on the squad leader to allow the placement of such equipment (essentially a rallypoint looks like 3 bags placed on the ground, and a FOB looks like a radio on a table); these are usually meant to be placed in a building or location that you can then build fortifications to protect the FOB spawn point. If an enemy squad/team over runs/takes/captures the FOB, they can then continue to use the FOB as an enemy spawn location. FOBs, can also be destroyed with explosives ect..\n\n6) Building is reserved to only certain locations, which are usually small compounds centered near or around objectives. Once you walk into or around the vicinity of the compound, a given amount of "construction points" are displayed in the top left of the screen. The points are used by squad leaders to build sandbag walls, barbwire fences ect. Once a squad leader places a fortification, it must then be built by other squad members using the "shovel" tool. A whole compound can be fortified leaving all windows and entrances blocked by choice of the squad leaders; anywhere within or directly near the compound, fortifications can be built. Construction points are shared between all squad leaders, so it is important to be smart with placement of items... It should be obvious, but if you place a sandbag wall infront of a window, try not to leave any cracks between the sandbag wall and the window itself... enemies will use said cracks in the fortification to wreck everyone within the compound... It should be remembered, as its easy to know; if you can see out, then the enemy can see in.\n\n7) As squad leader, you must be helpful to your squad by way of communication; since FOBs and rallypoints can only be placed by squad leaders, it is imperative that squad communication is present; less so by other squad members, but it is absolutely necessary for the captain of the squad as he conducts the progression of the game. Without rallypoints or FOBs placed, the game quickly turns into a walking simulator for all other players and it guarantees a loss when the other team is using such tools accurately. Again, this game is "squad/team" dependant; you must be team player. Which to mention, the community seems at this time, to be far from Toxic; players work together and with a proper team (even without vehicles) the game can be quite enjoyable.\n\n8) The game runs at 50-60 Frames for myself, and most if not all settings are set to max. Frames in game, are entirely dependant on the quality of the server being played, as well as the current or allowed population. If I were to play a max 40 player match, I can maintain the 50-60 FPS no problem; but if I join a 65+ man server, I get about 30-40 frames tops.\nBecause I didn't read it anywhere, and didn't realize until after I purchased the game, it should also be known that the 100 player servers as advertised have yet to be added to the game; most likely due to the fact that smaller servers are already having difficulty with frames, ping ect... With the fact that most servers provide low FPS with higher player count; most servers to me at least, are simply unplayable due to high ping or FPS instablity; this has left my server choices rather limited if I choose to play with the best experience. Just to say, in case people are wondering; I have a 4GB GTX 970, i7-3820, 12GB ddr3 and I play at a resolution of 1080p.\n\n9) The major hangups I have with the game at this current time, which I believe is hindering it from becoming perfect, is primarily the lack of vehicles... Running the long distances sucks terribly, and like me, you'll probably learn to hate your stamina; not only because you're always waiting for it to refill, but because it takes nothing to deplete it; which means about 75% of your game time, is spent hunkered down in the bushes waiting for your bar to fill. I'm sure this is a tactic by devs to force players to linger in the bush intentionally instead of simply rushing objectives nonstop, or is a way to force squad leaders to always be aware of placing FOBs or rallyponts; either way, I very much despise it. Personally, I believe at the games current beta build, stamina should be increased for the enjoyment of the game; that is until vehicles are added.\n\n- Now, I completely accept that this game is very early beta, but considering the results of other Steam betas which eventually slowed and nearly stopped with worthwhile updates; I review my games as if they are not to recieve another update and are standalone... Yeah, I'm talking to you Ark Survival... You can keep adding different dinos, but you can't fix your 10 FPS code?..

Sure, there are plenty of Multiplayer 1st Person shooters. Plenty of them are built in Unreal engine.\n\nBut this one has a legacy, and that legacy is Project Reality.\n\nThat's not to say that this will end up -being- Project Reality, so if you're looking for a direct, updated 1:1 match, this hasn't gotten there yet. But it is framed and inspired by PR at its core by Communications and Teamwork being the focus and most significant components of the gameplay.\n\nIn the (relatively) short amount of time since the Kickstarter concluded, this game has seen a lot of iteration and dedication put into getting things just right, in proving out the framework and all the elements that have gone into the game in order to make it possible for it to survive and be expanded upon and more importantly, for it to remain fun and engaging for the player.\n\nThere is still a lot of work left to be done: there will be bugs, hurdles, stumbles and changes.

I have been following its progress for years now, and I am amazed of what the devs have accomplished so far. Squad is not as mature as Project Reality mod is right now, but it offers a much better engine that will allow for much more than the 10 year old BF2 engine could handle.\n\nThe current alpha is very playable. In just 2 hours of playtime, I've been in some intense and amazing firefights. The sound design is something to be commended as well. The gunfire and explosions really immerse you in the battlefield. Communication is key in this game. If you don't speak up or have a mic, you'll be missing out on the most important gameplay element of Squad, teamplay. This game is the anti-run&gun and lone wolf FPS.

You're part of a well oiled machine, teamwork and communication will win the day. So grab a mic and get ready to do your bit.\n\nRemember this is early access so half the planned features are missing but it's core gameplay is down pat and is already an intense experience. If you want to get the most out of SQUAD join the game, join a squad and listen to your Squad Leader, he's there to help you and vice versa. He will be your guiding hand and you will be his weapon.\n\nBeing Early Access and Alpha, there are naturally some performance gripes but remember, the game is running in Unreal with very large maps and large numbers of players, things will get better but for the meantime just fiddle with your settings and check the forums or subreddit. All us backers are here to help and so are the devs, they've been releasing daily hotfixes in preparation for the EA launch and even finding time to play with us plebs so remember this is a small indie team before you go off the wall and post something silly.\n\nSo, if you miss BF2 and the good ole days before ranking and unlocks where teamplay and objectives were the be all and end all, Squad is for you.

If you don't work as a team and communicate effectively you're going to have a bad time. There is a learning curve, and don't count on seeing the enemy, understanding fire superiority is key to push forward as a squad. Learning how to squad lead effectively is extremely rewarding, nothing is better than getting your guys in perfect ambush position and holding fire until they get out in the open......sweet sweet endorphine rush.\n\nStill quite a few kinks to work through with optimization and anti-cheat, but if you're rig exceeds the recommended specs you should be good to go. Think of it as an infantry only version of Project Reality at this time. The game and the graphics engine are both in early development so this one should really take off in a year, the community is pretty healthy as you need to use teamwork to win. The learning curve is steep, but once you figure it all out it's hard to play anything else.\n\nTip: Currently Set Shadows to Low (not shadow detail), memory leak or something on that setting and it doesn't really make a difference visually but you'll get back your framerate.","January 28","true","557.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It requires so much more skill both for the individual and team than most other shooters i have seen recently. All the communication and cooperation of squads are vital and have proved to greatly immerse the player into the environment and gameplay. Though winning and losing doesn't give any achievements or hurt the player's reputation in any way, you feel a real sense of responsibility to your teammates to do well and to have the best plan. This response may be due to the fact that we can hear eachothers voices which really creates a sense of community and brotherhood.

The rest of the time is spent hunkering down with the squad leader and the team prepping for the next objective, moving forward cautiously and looking for movement in the distance, setting up FOBS and defences in strategic locations and discussing all the possibilities and outcomes of what could happen in the next 30 seconds, every 30 seconds.\n\nWhen the squad I'm in starts opening fire, I get a buzz.\n\nYou spend most of the game preparing for enemy engagements, most of the game is spent tensing yourself up and you experience a lot of anxiety. Then when you start engaging, it's almost like a relief.\n\nI love the gunshots in the distance when other teams are engaging and I especially love hearing the gunshots increase in intensity when all of the sudden our squad leader tells us that Bravo team needs assistance.\n\nGrenades make you jump and are loud enough, and their visual effects are strong enough, to momentarily stun you, especially if it wasn't expected.

It's current build is still in test phases, yet already offers intense gameplay with an incredible amount of potential, especially since this game as a somewhat direct response to the limitations to project reality, a milsim modification.\n\nSuch a feat for a great game also lies within the community that plays it. For the most part, everyone seems to be fully immersed into the environment, a handful of maps with only a few specific locations for objectives, yet has miles and miles of details, distant houses and rolling hills, settlements and farms. This tells you immediately the ambitions of the developers and how much they want to expand this game into having enormous amounts of content in the future. The players, are able to tactfully (or not) navigate around these expansive terrains and establish forward operating bases so that other players may spawn in that location, or a rally point so your squad specifically can have a limited time to assist your squad leader.\n\nAll of these features are a direct result of player communication and teamwork. A good squad will always keep their head in the game and keep each other updated, and learn the game more. With a realistic environment and sense of danger, you are able to put yourself in a position where you play into the game’s world, making it all the more an energetic rush of adrenalin and fear.\n\nPlease don’t become Interstellar Marines, you have the potential to make this into such a great product that you guys will be sitting on mountains of cash, you probably feel that way already. The only downfall is that you guys have to stop those idiots using smoke grenade exploits and that “lost connection to host” anomaly that kicks you out of your game every so often, bordering on “occasional”.\n\nAnother qualm that I am sure will be figured out soon is a way to keep people working as a team and stop with the MLG pro counterstrike tier combat. Finally, a favorites system would be so helpful for singling out the best servers for players so they don’t have to go through server listings on the other side of the planet where ping is just nonexistent.\n\nA serious rating from me personally? 8/10.\nOne point for connection problems and a few glitches, other point due to a small fraction of the community bending the direction of the approach this game is meant to have, either by not being a team player, or trolling, exploits, making fun of people that are immersed and taking it “seriously”.\n\nMessage to developers:\nI've noticed something that you should consider looking into. For me, aiming isn't necessarily a problem, but when I am firing at a target at two hundred meters, moving the scope a single centimeter doesn't really have a smooth transition, it has this minor, blocky flick to the next pixel and that makes it extremely hard to get it lined up with my target. I understand that it should be difficult to aim, but this minor thing really throws me off when I am taking down targets.\n\nIt's quite unsettling to know that people have somehow mastered being able to one shot you with iron sights at that distance. Maybe I just suck, but in games like Red Orchestra 2, ARMA, etc my precision is much better, rather than having your view subtly bump with every movement, a smoother one take place for aiming. It would make a huge difference for many that really do try to legitimately line up shots rather than relying on unfounded casual shooter skills.","December 25, 2015","true","49.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

This development team started out as a community game creating a mod, simply to make the game that they wanted to play - Project Reality. Using the BF2 engine they accomplished some unbelievable things. BUT times change and that engine got old. So, fast forward to 2015 and here we are, with the Alpha release of Squad.\n\nAlready it plays better than most AAA titles. More realistic than BF4, prettier than insurgency, more accessible and less clunky than ArmA, and with more teamwork than all of those combined.\n\nCurrently it focuses on infantry combat, and does a pretty damn epic job. Within the next few weeks we will see things change massively with the introduction of vehicles to the mix. Engagement ranges will change, teamwork will improve and coordination will be needed to win. As usual the best place to play is on the tacticalgamer.com server which has a primer and ruleset established over a decade ago to get the most realistic and fun experience out of this game.

The learning curve is much lower while still  keeping with the realistic themes of ARMA and Project Reality. The controls are intuitive and easy to learn. Squad medchanics and base building are fun and allow for a high amount of flexibility for various combat scenarios. From my observations on the subreddit and in-game, I can say that the devs are highly involved with the community. They play the game with us because they enjoy it and want to see it grow.

And it's perfect. I bought the game back in September for $70 and I think it was worth every penny. I have nothing but positive things to say about the game. The best part is offworld's development methods. I see the devs on the forums interacting with players. There have been many times where they will ask us to go to their server to help them fix something and crash it and we will becase A lot of the squad players want this game to succede!\n\nThe comunity in this game is another great thing! They are awesome! If you are new just let your squad know and they will rush to help you and bring you up to speed. Sure there are those few bad ones that every community has but they are drowned out by the majority of great players in the game.\n\nI will say that you 99% NEED a mic for this game. You will not be favored if you play without a mic.

Currently Squad however doesn't have as many contents as PR mod, and there's some minor issues still left in game, The dev team used to give quite great promises during the Kickstarter funding campaign, and some of them are yet to implement, which is kind of slow.\n\nSo my current suggestion is to put this game on watch list, wait for few months and see if this game is getting better.\n\nIf you insist on getting this game, maybe you should check if there's a server running at your country first.

Now although my page states i have played 26 hours, i was part of the Pre-alpha, closed alpha and obviously am playing throughout EA so i have witnessed many changes, additions and have had the pleasure of playing with the devs so i do know quite a bit about the game/its current mechanics.\n\nNow before reading this or any other review i do encourage you to jump over to JoinSquad.com and read the updates and forum posts because if you're thinking of buying this you should know that my opinions may have changed now because they may have updated many aspects of what i cover - it is early access afterall.\n\nPros\n\n- The infantry combat is extremely good and i feel that i have the power to make a difference to an entire game/match. This is a feeling sourely missed in many games such as battlefield, Cod, some Arma mini-games. You can take out an entire squad of enemies by finding the correct positions, aiming well and then capture an objective turning the entire match around because of your back-cap of their objective.\n\n- Teamplay is key. When i play games such as Insurgency, Battlefield, Cod, Arma (other than milsim) the feeling of being in a team or squad is just names on a list that allow me to either spawn next to speed up my chances of getting into action or maybe can heal me every now and again. Where-as Squad offers the chance to actually feel like you are part of something much bigger. Your Squad can work together to fight in a town full of enemies to capture an objective or defend a compound or even flank the enemy by traveling deep behind enemy lines. I'll always remember a Good squad leaders that split the Squad i was in, into two fireteams and set myself, a medic and two rifleman and a grenadier to go north, flank the enemy and back-cap them while the other 4 squad members defended the objective with their lives. The fight was intense, comms were perfect and we used our superior tactics and teamwork to change a losing game into a impressive victory.\n\n- A bridge between Arma and Battlefield. Now i know many say this but i feel it is true. You have constant combat of BF (granted this is depending on map) with the tactics and realism of Arma (also dependent on squad leaders skills). My problem with battlefield is that it is too runny and gunny for me, the lack of tactics and the ease and lack fo challenge makes the game too boring for me. I have way over 1000 hours in Arma 3 and love the game. However, i love the teamplay of milsim with it but in a two hour session i'll probably walk for 2 hours and shoot some 30 enemies where-as Squad allows me to be constantly ingulfed in a warzone of action, have the teamplay i want but also provide challenge and the sense of no two games are the same.\n\n- The promise of content and the developers - I love Project Reality and i find the fact that they have announced through both kickstarter and website the types of vehicles (at minimum) to be very promising. The developers are always busy working on this game and have released many updates (at minimum once a month in Closed alpha) and around 3-4 since release of early access. They enjoy the game as much as we do and are very dedicated to creating new content, improving user experience and performance and just making the game they want to play. My friend had a problem with turning and the sudden decrease in fps that occurred (something that didnt happen to my other 5 friends) but one of the developers was very fast in responding and helping us out and now the problem is fixed!\n\n- Community is great, helpful and most of the Squad leaders know what they are doing and are always happy to receive new players who wish to take part in the squad, follow the leaders instructions and learn how to properly play the game.\n\nCons\n\n- The Price for current content is quite high. I do not disagree with the price personally but many of my friends think it is high especially for an 'early access' game which seems to be the 'done thing' of starting cheap and raising price closer to release however, i'd much rather put £30 into a game now and get the features i want promised and delivered than put £10 into a game and have the developers and myself thinking well they only put £10 into the game so i can take my time. Squad is not a 'cheap' game but if anything this encourages myself to actively support and contribute to the community and also help the developers to be  able to afford more team members and keep them motivated to carry on creating a game i love.\n\n- Some performance issues in both Server and client. The game will run buttersmooth 60fps+ on ultra preset for me if im in a a good server with 50-60 people in however, if the map is on Kohat (one of the larger maps) with 70+ players my performance goes to below 30fps and i do not think i have a 'bad' pc (I7 4790k, r9 390x). With their last update i gained 10fps though so this is DEFINITELY just because its new and some-what unoptimised (or rather not as optimised as it could be).\n\n-  Some of the players (usually newer players) are treating the game as if it is Call of duty with the solo 'run and gun' type mindset. This would be ok if they didnt join a squad, take the only available sniper role and then run 2km away from the squad to then die and lose tickets for the team. This is bound to happen in anygame but just be aware that Squad leaders can and will kick you if you misbehave, do not contribute towards the squad or mess aroun when theyre trying to play tactically.\n\n- Hackers, although i have not experienced many in-game i have experienced a few. One was killing people who spawned in at the start of the game and another was screaming 'Allah huecbar' and 'Alan Snackbar' while somehow dropping explosions around the map. This will be hopefully fixed soon due to the change-over to what i believe is EAC - easy anti-cheat i believe but could be wrong. But be assured its in the devs top priority list along with vehicles and performance.\n\nOne of the major compelling parts of PR for me was the cross of air, infantry and ground units/vehicles and this is sorely missed in Squad at the minute but its EA and they have promised to give us what we and they want!\n\nOverall opinion:\nOverall i'd give the current game 7.5/10 for infantry combat, fun aspect and teamwork and promised features assuming they are like PR's. However when new maps, vehicles and performance increases i feel this game will easily surpass to the 9/10.","January 4","true","42.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

I'll probably update this comment for when they add them and in other notable updates.---\n\nSquad is a semi-realistic game made by some of the people who helped make the Project Reality mod for BF2. Squad is a game that balances realism and arcade and is teamwork centric. Some of the things it features include: constructing FOBs (spawnpoint/base with optional defenses), combined arms and asymmetric warfare (when they add vehicles), realistic depictions of nation's uniforms, gear and equipment and PTSD.\n\nAlso if you've played and enjoyed games such as Insurgency, Rainbow Six series, ARMA series, Red Orchestra series, and many other notable games you're guaranteed to enjoy.

The overall ideology of this mod is to create a team-based tactical shooter game that looking towards to some degree of realism. I'm not gonna talk too much about PR here, this is just a peek on where Squad is heading to.\n\nSo let us go back to Squad. So far Squad only features infantry combat, ground light vehicles will be available within most likely a month, so my review will only focus on the infantry combat for now.\n\nThis game is all about tactical cooperation and sticking together as a SQUAD while obeying orders from your squad leader. It goes so far that not only it encourages you to stay with the squad, you will get penalites from being a lone wolf.\n\nFor example, not join a squad will limit your select-able kit to basic rifleman,  dynamic role limitation system(or whatever it's actually called) allows you to choose from more kits progressively if certain number of players is in your squad and your team, and if you decided to go for getting the kits you want from other squad and quit then good for you, because the game will take away your kit at the moment you left and re-assign you with a "recruit" kit with the ammo you left before you quit the squad. Without a squad you can easily get pinned down and killed from enemy gun fire while no one can help you out.\n\nThis game binds players together so tie that even you don't know each other you can still play as a squad and win the game easily, and that's the whole point of realistic tactical shooter game isn't it?\n\nThough it's only in Early Access with just infantry combat for a large scale FPS, and it does have many many incomplete and unpolished aspects (such as animation glitch, spawn glitch, FOB camping, etc.), irritating bugs exist here and there (medical reviving is buggy as fxxk which includes not properly located, teleporting fallen one to nowhere when getting them up, etc.) But it does find a well balance between realism and gameplay as its predecessor PR, you can't hide a shinning gem like Squad from anything.","December 15, 2015","true","163.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","1"

The gameplay is so much better now and it's so much fun playing again. Communications are working most of the time so get your mic ready and start playing ;D]\n\n[There are still performance issues with AMD CPUs which are hopefully fixed asap - As far as I know especially the Fx-8350]\n______________________________________________________________\n\nI've played this game about 300-400hrs [outdated 400hrs +] (playing since August 2015) and since steam release I nearly stopped playing it at all. I'll mention the "why" in my review. (The two reasons mentioned below are since steam release, never really had these situations before)\n\nThe game itself is great, especially for those of you who played PR.\n\nAtm it's just infantry based combat in Desert or Forest environments, but highly tactical and works best with COMMUNICATION!\n\nAnd there is the first reason why I don't recommend this game.\nThere are WAY to many people playing this game who don't communicate with each other, maybe in the squad itself but most squad LEADERS don't talk to each other, which results in total chaos. Every squad does their own thing and are scattered all over the map.\nTo find a server where this is not the case you'll search for hours... if you're on a server where the communication works appropriately you'll get the best combat experience you ever had in a game!\n\nAnother feature that's available atm and that'll be expanded over the time is the abillity to set up FOBs (Forward operating Bases) which you can expand with barricades and hopefully cal. 50s or similar in later patches.\n\nAnd there is the second reason that is completely destroying my experience in this game.\nThere are WAY to many people who're thinking that it's a good idea to play minecraft the whole match and build a massive super FOB (mostly ones which are placed on flags). Not that it's bad to build fobs, but you should make sure that you're capable of defending it.\n\nIn most games you got 3 of about 5 squads camping at one flag and barricading themselfes... so you got a compound filled with about 20-30 people... those of you who got an idea which impact explosives like 30mm grenades or frag grenades got in a closed off Compound filled with ~25 people know why this is a bad idea.\n\nAs I said before... if you don't have this scenario and 1-2 squads are actually defending the d-flag without doing the above mentioned and if the communications work appropriately ...\n\n... YOU WILL HAVE THE BEST TIME OF YOU LIFE!\n\nYOU'LL HAVE:\n\n- Intense combat situations which mostly consists of you sitting behind cover, crying and sh***ing your brand new camo pants!\n- Tactical approach towards enemy flags or bases!\n- 15-50 people working together to show the enemy that they stand no chance!\n- Beautiful detailed maps based on real satelite data!\n- The best sounddesign in a shooter I've ever heard\n- No weapon customisation with cute little stickers and doodads... NO, this is WAR! Go HARD or go HOME!\n\nI really really like this game and can recommend it to everyone! BUT play the game how it's meant to be played!\nTalk to other people and only play squadleader if you'll make arrangements with the other squads!\n\nThink twice if whatever you're doing is useful, for example building a fob on a d-flag... No! It's probably not because if you can't hold your flag you'll lose the FOB too... this means you'll lose at least 20 tickets for nothing! Think about if it's better to place an FOB and don't expand it so that enemy forces have to search it rather than display it on the top of the hill... Your decissions as squad leader are GAMECHANGING so think them through!\n\nThis is Joker, aka grenadier of the month, over and out.","January 16","true","137.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","3"

Gamebreaking bugs. Non-gamebreaking bugs. Balance issues. Etc.\n\nBut if you're able to look past those things in its alpha state, it's actually quite enjoyable, especially when you have a team that works together and isn't toxic. And to ensure that you aren't one of those players, make sure you read the user manual, even if it's just a skim through. A basic knowledge of how objectives work on different game modes, and how each others classes work can really make or break a team. The rest comes from experience. Be it knowing when to hunker down and hold the line, break contact, or take a more aggressive approach.\n\nOnce you have those key elements down though, it's easy to have fun with it. One team suppresses while the other flanks around. Defending an objective from enemy forces. All of it has its fun, even if you're on the losing side. Most games tend to be close, anyway, cutting it within a few tickets each.\n\nAt the end of the day, with the constant updates to the game, and with unreal's engine still being in its baby stages, this game hold a lot of potential.","December 16, 2015","true","27.8"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","16","29","0","0"

You can really play throught it and enjoy yourself. My main issue was the lag spikes but with the newest christmas eve patch they seem to have fixed that.\n\nPros: Sounds are A++ one of the best sound packages for any FPS on the market. The noise of the round cracking when it gets close to your head, or when other players are shooting around you sounds extremely authentic. Even when you shoot inside a room, the sound changes pitch.\n\nWeapons calibration seems pretty dead on, US military trains to hit targets up to 300 meters away, most engagements in game are any where between 25 and 150 meters which brings into account accuracy.\n\nRealism, Round count is key since you don't have a counter on your HUD, reloading is also a manual task when your magazine is empty as it is in real life.\n\nTeamwork is everything, you can get massive kills and still maintain the same score if killing the enemy isnt nesscary to the mission.\n\nCons:\nThe most annoying part of the game wasn't the game itself, it was finding a server to play the game on. I wanted the full experience with the most number of players as possible, But, I also wanted the low FPS that I know I can handle, the problem was, not enough servers of my choosing,\n\nIt would be nice if there was a auto join feater on top of the manual choosing server to facilitate with finding the best server for you.\n\nMaybe a dedicated section for Squads to train, I understand there is a training map but maybe a area where squads can work on military battle drills.\n\nMore specifc roles in the squd, The ability to have teamleaders would help out immensely at Base construction and would also take the place of squad leader when the SL falls.\n\nbetter mapping system, using a military style MLGS grid system similar to ARMA 3 lay out would make it easier in identifying targets\n\n\nAll and all its a great game and in a year time this game will be more polished and will only get better.","December 24, 2015","true","76.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Every itteration improves performance, weapons, and general gameplay.\nThe gameplay is smooth, but there have been some people confused about the specs needed. AMD seems to suffer slightly with the game. The occasional kick also happens, but you need to be aware that it IS EARLY ACCESS.\nSaying that though, I have had such an amazing experience in this game. It is one of the most polished, playable and exciting Early Access games that I have played in a hell of a long time on Steam. If you enjoy your military simulators, then I recommend giving this a try. Don't be confused and think it is Arma or Battlefield, but think of Grown Up Battlefield 3, with actual communication and strategy, compound clearing excitement and hitboxes which work. All in all, an absolutely solid effort from Offworld, and a briliant advance from Project Reality.","December 22, 2015","true","28.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The community and team play is what really makes this game. On top of the sound and realism of the combat (which is more forgiving than Arma but still as satisfying) it makes for one of the best multiplayer military fps experiences in the gaming industry to date. Communication is key, play with a mic, get to know your squad, listen to squad leaders commands and work as a team and there in is where the game shines.

This game almost perfectly fills the whole I had from the arma missions I used to play with a group. The advantage this has over Arma is it is all in one easy to access focused package. Also, it runs a hell of a lot better.\n\nThe only real problem I have is that games can be inconsistent, and how enjoyable a match is for you largely relies on your teammates. So far though, I usually get pretty decent groupings.\n\nOne bit of advice I'll chuck out to people who aren't used to proper milsim type combat is, SPREAD THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT. Too many times I see entire squads being supressed by single LMGs, or 4-5 people blown up by 1 grenade. Spreading out also comes with the advantage of making it harder for you to be flanked. It's good to work together as a team, but that doesn't mean you have to all be holding each others hands, try to keep atleast 3-4 meters between you and other teammates. If that means missing out on shooting at people the rest of your squad is, then good. This game isn't about kills, your better off covering sectors other people aren't than trying to shoot at the ones other people already are. The only time this doesn't really apply, is when you are stacking against a wall to breach a doorway or opening.","December 17, 2015","true","83.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The community and team play is what really makes this game. On top of the sound and realism of the combat (which is more forgiving than Arma but still as satisfying) it makes for one of the best multiplayer military fps experiences in the gaming industry to date. Communication is key, play with a mic, get to know your squad, listen to squad leaders commands and work as a team and there in is where the game shines.

Instantly most of members replied (t'was the start of the match). I said that i was new so don't bash me too hard if i f**k up, i waited for some typical CSGO-ish insults...but instead all i got was "Don't worry man, if you need help with anything, just ask!". I was shocked! A cooperation based war game with ACTUAL team feeling? C'mon i gotta be high or something.\nBut what happened the rest of the match confirmed that i wasn't high nor dreaming.\nSquad leader sent us to some sort of complex. we needed to wipe the enemies from it and fortify the position. No errors, no team insults, everyone was helping each other to get inside, take out the russians and fortify. "Hey i need someone with a shovel here to make sandbags!" 2 guys came.\nWe stood there for a while waiting and our squad leader left and, still don't know how, seems i was the team leader. I didn't knew it until had 3 guys infront of me yelling "for f*cks sake Beer! You're the squad leader! Do your job!".\nWe were surrounded by russiand and shots were coming from everywhere, i commanded to take cover inside a 2 story building since peaking out was 100% suicide, our plan was wait for a window to retreat to a safe location. Then a different "radio channel" popped out.\n"Hey 2nd squad what's your situation", inside my head all i could do is call me stupid for not thinking that there a radio channel for squad leaders to communicate between 'em. "Well...we're kinda f*cked here, we're trying to hold the fort but we're surrounded and taking casualties".\n"Don't worry, lad. Were Oscar Mike. Be there in less than 5 minutes"\nThe shots intensified, and not from our side of the walls. Granades blowing all around the yard. And then... they started to stop, every second there were less shots...\ni peaked from a windows to check what was going on and there they were. 9 guys getting into the yard and one of em saying "hey second squad, needed help?".\n\nWe lost the match afterwards but the feeling was that we won any way.\nI never felt terrified in a war game before...The shots flying around your head. Watching squad mates fall as the shooting intensifies and you see more and more figures peaking around the trees.\nAnd the intense feeling of joy of seeing another squad actualy coming to help you.\n\nSo my veredict is this...\nWhile having some typical alpha issues (Optimization, not much content)\nIt is playable, and if it is so awesome now on alpha...i can't even imagine how will it be finished.\n\nBest 37 euros spent in my whole life.","December 29, 2015","true","10.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I love the communication and team play aspect of the game, that being one of the main reasons I bought it. It is still in alpha so many things need to be added and fine tuned. Some of the negatives, no vehicles in game yet, only 3 fractions that are playable as of now. It has not been optimized yet so fps drops all around for even decent gaming rigs. There are cheaters in this game that run freely, in the almost 60 hours i have online, ive run into at least 10 instances of guys using some kind of aiming cheat or auto grenade launchers, there needs to be active admins and people banning these cheaters.

Combat is a perfect blend between Battlefield and Arma. Suggestion: DO NOT PLAY/BUY IF YOU DON'T HAVE A MIC, OR IF YOU HAVE AN AMD CPU!!! such crucial aspects to the game since its still in alpha.

First 3 hours were torture. Pretty sure I got zero kills (the scoring was confusing at first) and may not have even gotten a round within 50 meters of anyone.  A lot of spray and pray and die. Remarkably my teammates were helpful and never got on me for being a newb. Also amazingly not a single one ever ***** my mother or wanted me to eat ***** and die. (good people)\n\nSomewhere around the 3rd hour after a lot of help from various squad mates I finally figured out the basic process of maneuvering on targets. I got my first confirmed kill following a squad leader into a castle ruin compound. We went around a corner and he cleared left as I swept right to see the enemy on the second floor of the ruins just as he noticed me. He raised his weapon and it was almost as if I could see the terror in his eyes as he realized he wouldn't be quick enough. On this 3rd hour the kill was mine. I calmly clicked the mouse 3 times and put 3 shots center mass and watched as he crumpled to the floor.\n\n"Good kill bud, you saved my 6 on that one," crackled over the radio from my squad leader. My heart was pounding and in that moment I realized that one kill felt better than any killstreak or combo I have ever achieved in any other game. All the misery and hike'n'dies were worth it. Team work is the ultimate payoff in this game. Sometimes you get the kill and sometimes your squad mate saves your butt, however both are just as satisfying.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stockloc/recommended/393380/","stockloc","Anti-Cheat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stockloc/","285 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSquad has good potential to become one of the best tactical shooters out there. The gunplay is on point and the teamwork fundamentals are there, but there is still something lacking.\n\nFor one, the game is unoptimized in its current state. That's forgivable given its alpha status but optimization should be something that must be fixed. By optimization, I don't mean framerate issues as I've had none. However, the game's graphics seem to be a bit funky; on lowest settings, everything seems to be pixelated past a certain distance which makes seeing enemies from long distances a difficult task. I remember getting shot from a hill but I was unable to spot the people firing due to the pixelization.\n\nThe game itself also lacks features in its current state. There are no vehicles which means traversing the map can be tedious and time-consuming. I'm not complaining as I'm all for realism but I wanted to let you know, the consumer, what you're getting with this version of the game.\n\nTeamwork is great. I love hearing my teammates organizing a plan of attack because it really immerses me into the game. Everyone seems to be mature which is good to know. The less-patient players seem to be very few in this game which makes it all the better. Of course, don't expect every squad to be well organized as there are, as in every game, d-bags who try to ruin the game for everyone. If you're matched with people publicly, expect the worst.\n\nGunplay itself is wonderful. The guns sound amazing; they have the impact and crunch you'd expect from a gun. Bullets drop realistically and taking fire from weapons adds chromatic abrasion to your screen to simulate PTSD. You can switch from automatic to semi-automatic modes on your rifles.\n\nLong story short: if you like infantry-based combat with a heavy emphasis on teamwork, get this game. Be mindful that you may never fire your weapon before dying and that dying costs your team tickets (which, when it gets to 0, causes your team to lose).

The gunplay is on point and the teamwork fundamentals are there, but there is still something lacking.\n\nFor one, the game is unoptimized in its current state. That's forgivable given its alpha status but optimization should be something that must be fixed. By optimization, I don't mean framerate issues as I've had none. However, the game's graphics seem to be a bit funky; on lowest settings, everything seems to be pixelated past a certain distance which makes seeing enemies from long distances a difficult task. I remember getting shot from a hill but I was unable to spot the people firing due to the pixelization.\n\nThe game itself also lacks features in its current state. There are no vehicles which means traversing the map can be tedious and time-consuming. I'm not complaining as I'm all for realism but I wanted to let you know, the consumer, what you're getting with this version of the game.\n\nTeamwork is great. I love hearing my teammates organizing a plan of attack because it really immerses me into the game. Everyone seems to be mature which is good to know. The less-patient players seem to be very few in this game which makes it all the better. Of course, don't expect every squad to be well organized as there are, as in every game, d-bags who try to ruin the game for everyone. If you're matched with people publicly, expect the worst.\n\nGunplay itself is wonderful. The guns sound amazing; they have the impact and crunch you'd expect from a gun. Bullets drop realistically and taking fire from weapons adds chromatic abrasion to your screen to simulate PTSD. You can switch from automatic to semi-automatic modes on your rifles.\n\nLong story short: if you like infantry-based combat with a heavy emphasis on teamwork, get this game. Be mindful that you may never fire your weapon before dying and that dying costs your team tickets (which, when it gets to 0, causes your team to lose). If you prefer an action-packed shooter, skip this title. Not much action to be had...yet.\n\nRating for this alpha: 7/10. One of the better alphas out there, but not worth the $50 price tag in my opinion.

I am excited for what cool features the future holds.\n\nYou should know that in its current state, SQUAD is far from what it will be upon completion. Currently, there is only infantry. But land vehicles like APC's, humvees, trucks, and motorcycles and close to being finished, and we will probably see them in january. Then eventually, transport helicopters, attack helis, and jets, maybe even boats when they make a water based map. $40 dollars is a fair price for the amount of content the game will eventually provide.\n\n\nI reccomend this game to those who like a battlefield where tactics and logic are envolved. Where teamwork wins and being a lonewolf ninja is impossible.\n\nTrue first person view, you can see your body.\nWonderfur sound effects, and even greater particle effects for bullets hitting walls, smoke from smoke grenades etc.\n100 player count.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainkrafty/recommended/393380/","captainkrafty","Onearmy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainkrafty/","565 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSquad is a large-scale FPS with support for up to 100 players in various gamemodes. The development team, Offworld Industries, is largely made up of former developers for Project Reality: BF2, one of the oldest and most popular mods for Battlefield 2.\n\nThe focus of Squad is on semi-realistic teamplay that revolved around squads. There are a few different gamemodes, such as Conquest, Assault And Secure, and Insurgency. All of these gamemodes have varying objectives and ways to win.\n\nMy personal favorite mode is Insurgency, which pits a faction of insurgents against US forces. The insurgent team is tasked with protecting a series of weapons caches, the position of which is unknown to US forces at the beginning. By gathering intel, the US forces can get the rough location of a cache and with enough intel they can determe the exact location of a cache. After destroying a certain number of caches, the US forces win. However, they have limited tickets so casualties are not something they can afford as opposed to the insurgents who have an unlimited number of tickets, but only a few caches.\n\nThe majority of the Squad community is mature and helpful. There are many community servers with good people that inhabit them. When playing with a proper squad you will have one of the best times ever.\n\nThe sounds and the graphics are pretty solid, although the game is currently rather demanding on the spec side. This will change as the game is optimized.\n\nI definitely recommend Squad, even  in early access. This is going to be one of my few go-to games for a long time coming. There are bugs and glitches that may pop up every now and then, but the developers are working diligently to make this one of the best tactical games available.\n\nI look forward to seeing and playing with you all.

I am excited that this game is finally released to the rifleman and other steam users. It is kind of a learning curve but if you just use your knowledge from other realistic shooters you can do well in this game. So far playing medic has been the most fun for me personally. It is awesome being able to bring back your squad and teammates back into the fight and having them rely on you. One personal tip is if youre going to be a squad leader to coordinate with other squad leaders. One example is we built a nice fob but it came under attack and we were naded and suffering massive causilties I was able to coordinate a counter attack by going out the back of the fob and clearing out our perimeter then we were able to take the fight to the enemy. This game is alot of fun and in order to get the full enjoyment make sure you have a mic, and dont even think about team killing.","December 15, 2015","true","53.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

One round squad is very fun, and the next round, it is a mess. When it is at its best, is when everyone is working as a team and are communicating effectively. These moments are very cool to be a part of. On the other side of the coin, sometimes the gameplay can feel random, with people not working as a team, or the teams being unbalanced. I would call this a cautious purchase. It is very fun and unique for steam, but needs to be further developed for me to recommend this to EVERYONE. This being said, if you are a fan of the genre, and played Project Reality, or Tactical Battlefield for Arma 3, then I would say to go for it, as the price may increase, as time passes.

Its more or less how the players/teams interact and move around the battlefield. It is not uncommon to get zero kills or to spend a whole match guarding an objective without much action.\n\nDisclaimer out of the way.  This is a fantasticly well made game with a great community.  Great graphics (the maps are amazing) and great gameplay.  If you want to be part of a team look no further.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dj_D3ath/recommended/393380/","Dj_D3ath","djd3ath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dj_D3ath/","216 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOkay since some vets of PR are complaining and Some people are a bit confused i will explain this better.\n\nThis game in its current state is a facepaced FPS similar to the game "insurgency" but with a larger engagment range. There will be close quarters to longer range little dots of people range. But At this stage that range is not very far to the final product.\n\nThe current game has you fighting Infantry vs Infantry, Fobs are easy to contruct, squad rally points(spawn points for squads) are easily put down, and last a long time. Flags are close together and fobs are destroyed by just being near them. This gamplay allows for fast paced gameplay where lonewolfing is easily achieved and can be effective, but is frowned upon. That being said, working as a squad is MUCH more effective in general and allows you to be much more ticket effective vs larger amounts of enemies.\n\nThat is the current gameplay, but the game will be going away from that in the next month and two with things like.\n\nVehicles, These assets can punish lone wolfing as to get from flag A to B is no longer just a single sprint away, you may need to drive from one to another to get anywhere in a timely manner, so if a squad takes a humvee and you are left alone at base with no transport, good luck trying to effective. This addition makes lonewolfs join squads even just for transport, but it also shows how being a squad can be more effective.\n\nFobs are currently ♥♥♥♥ easy to build, These will later require logistics brought up to contruct, slowing the construction of these key functions of the game, and making them much more valueable then they are now, which will force squads to be more wary of the defence and contruction of these, These will also then be less likely to be able to have a lone wolf be able to destroy these structures as such you will need a larger squad sized force to be able to deal with these.\n\nSquad rally points last forever in time, and dissapear after 9 spawns or enemy overrun it (you have to be pretty close) These rallies only add about 10 seconds to your spawn vs a FOB as such they can allow for almost instant fob creation and sustained battle capablities to a squad. In PR rallies will disspear after about a minute. They are designed for regrouping, not sustained battle. Their current design is not the final design, they will change heavily over time.\n\nThe maps themselves are mostly smaller sized maps, they have released larger maps but use only a fraction of the map. They are pushing the whole server into a close quarter situation, As such it is a twitch shooter right now, But later when it changes into you having to worry about that APC sitting on that hill all the way over there you will be taking  your running across open ground a bit more carefully. This will make you have to scout the hills and area before you do actions, a lonewolf wont have the benifit of so many eyes.\n\nSo over all This game is currently designed as a closer quarter about the sized of the current BF4 maps(which really is pretty small) you will run into enemies pretty quick and have a good twitch shooter experience.\n\nIn a few months this will all change(except for when the server is designed to play close quarter maps only) to a more squad based tactical shooter where tactics are seen over gunplay skill.\n\n\nAnd side note $40 is a steep cost, it is designed to allow the kick starters a bit more room as they paid $30, if $40 is seen as to expensive for you, just don't buy it for now, but if you got cash, go nuts. i would say for $40 you are kinda buying two games, the current twitch shooter, which will evolve into a larger battlefield game, so $20 for each isn't to bad =].\n\nSo i recommend this for people who don't mind laying down the $40 you will have a good time, but don't look for super serious team work just yet, it will come, but right now it will be more of a insurgency game, then an ARMA or PR game.\n\n****CURRENT PROBLEMS****\n\ngame is kinda buggy atm, crashes and disconnects during loading maps is a bit common, these are sure to be fixed but til they are be warned, AMD people are complaining of larger problems, but a fix seems very soon to be released. FPS in general is a bit on the lower side with FPS drops on things like smoke grenades, So be warned if you have a ♥♥♥♥ rig. But when in game, if you have the machine that can run it, it runs smooth enough during gameplay, just loading times are when you have to cross ya fingers.\n\n****BASIC FEATURES NOT IN YET****\n\nJust some things to think about as well before you buy. I will try to update these as things come into effect.\n\nThings like, bipods,vaulting,swiming(you can walk under water), logistics, Resupplying from riflemen type thing, Snipers that have good long range scopes, Weapon customising(currently you just get choice of with or without acog on 2 of the classes), Weapon emplacements(.50 cal, TOWs,Motars,AA), Individual squad chat(e.g. talking to just squad 1,2 or 3), A commander, destructable walls and such, Vehicles, Grappling ropes, Fast ropes(hehe).","December 15, 2015","true","40.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Squad takes that foundation and plants those tried and tested "modules" (medic system, spawn system, kit selection, large maps, teamwork, etc) and plants them into the Unreal Engine with ease.  Still in early access at the writing of this review, Squad is currently focused on the infantry battle (50 v 50) but has already begun working the implementation of air and ground assets.  Currently in game are the US Army, Russians, Taliban, and Militia (a sort of Chechnya catch all of sorts with various equipment from multiple origins)\n\nThe infantry and basic rifle/shooting mechanics are already solid with regular tweaks to ensure the game mirrors realistic weapon usage.  No doubt bigger things are planned for infantry weapons but the core mechanics are there to great effect. A stamina system keeps players from running and gunning - adding sway to your rifle when tired.  Similarly, you must slow your movement before regaining stamina.  Stamina also determines how well you can focus your aim for an accurate shot - though you'll spend just as much time firing in the general direction of the enemy to provide support by fire for your maneuver force.\n\nTeamwork is key in this game with specialist weapons and gear only being made available to members of a squad.  If you want an automatic rifleman, medic, RPG/LAW gunner for support you'd better join a squad.  Team communication is, of course, also key and the positional and squad based communications setup is perfect for this.  You'll want to get a microphone to be sure you can be a functioning teammate.  One key talks to all members in your squad (currently 9 man) regardless of distance to one another and a second button communicates with anyone within several meters of your position - allowing you to coordinate within your own squad but also with that random teammate you find yourself taking cover with inside a compound surrounded by angry Taliban.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful and are only improving.  There are some who experience hiccups or sluggish FPS on some of the more intensive maps, but regular updates have streamlined both assets and the mechanics to improve FPS across the board.  A decent rig is recommended as you'll want to up that view distance (These are impressively large maps) and resolution to ensure you are seeing everything and feeding that all important situational awareness.  Tracers and explosions are so great to observe, you almost wish you were closer to that explosion so you could see it better - then realize that's a death wish.\n\nSound is equally impressive.  Incoming rounds snap past and smack into the earth and walls and the  dynamic gunfire sounds based on range sucks you into the world.  Environment sounds are there as well and overall it complements the chaos of sporadic battles.\n\nThe game is also unforgiving in that one or two shots from a rifle are enough to take down most players.  Grenades are powerful enough to take out multiple players who don't pay attention to their squad's spacing.  You'd be wise to take a medic or two along in your squad.  Medics can heal minor wounds and also revive downed players giving your squad the ability to recover and sustain itself after a (semi) successful engagement.  This is all the more vital when spawn points are almost entirely player driven.  Your squad leader should not only be issuing verbal orders to your squad of 9 but also should be placing Rally Points - a spawn point in the form of assault packs/ammo boxes that only your squad uses.  Additionally your team can place Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) that allow the entire team to spawn there.  Add in the ability to place HESCO walls, sandbag bunkers, concertina wire, and heavy weapon emplacements – again, all player driven - and you have the option of building up some impressive defensive positions and providing dynamic gameplay that is different each time you play.\n\nIf you're still wondering if this is an early access game worth investing in I can tell you right now that this team knows what it's doing, has years of experience, and will not stop until this game is everything it can be - it's already well on its way.\n\nSquad's ready, form up.","December 15, 2015","true","52.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

In the future we'll have logistics, aircraft, ground vehicles (tanks, apcs, transport) and static emplacements which will slow the pace of the game down quite a bit. What the game offers now is a robust infantry based shooter, that has great Squad based gameplay. The games really come together when you have a squad leader who communicates and focuses on the objectives / winning and a Squad that is willing to listen and follow orders. I would highly suggest if you pick this game up to listen to and stick with your Squad Leader, especially if hes communicating and giving orders. If you end up in a silent squad that is all playing by themselves and not communicating I would suggest joining a different squad or give leading a go. It makes the game much more fun and your Squad will be infinitley more effective.\n\nSo far in the game we have some nice systems including the ability to build up bases anywhere on the map with a great building system, the squad leader places objects down and his squad can build them up with E-Tools. Large maps that will probably only get larger when vehicles are included, and various game modes including Advance and Secure (sector control gamemode) and Insurgency (find the insurgent weapon cache sites and destroy them). Also included in the game so fare are 4 different factions all with realistic loadouts and loadout restrictions within your squad based on how many people you have in your squad and how many of the kits are already taken.\n\nIf you play and enjoy Insurgency, Arma, Project Reality, and maybe even Battlefield I'm sure you can find fun and enoyment in this game. For $40 this game is very worth the buy, you'll be engrossed in the game at times and hours will just fly by as you have fun participating in large scale battles and securing objectives with your squad.\n\nFinal note: If your a player who doesn't like playing as a team, this game may or may not be for you. I believe "lone wolf" shouldn't be shunned away but if you refuse to play as a team and listen to your squad leader I only ask that you DO NOT JOIN A SQUAD AND TAKE A USEFULL KIT ONLY TO BE SILENT THE WHOLE GAME AND GO OFF AND PLAY BY YOURSELF, IF YOU WANT TO PLAY LIKE THAT JUST DON'T JOIN A SQUAD.","December 15, 2015","true","143.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

It is simply the best tactical shooter I have ever had an occasion to play and its just in Alpha stage!. Extremely replayable, addicting and rewardable if you work and communicate as a team which is the main core concept of the game. Squad is supposed to fill the gap between Arma 3 and Battlefield and does it perfectly. Developers are doing a great job and put a lot of heart into the development. They are active on the forums and actually listen to the players. Can't recommend a better tactical shooter than Squad.","December 15, 2015","true","234.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Squad is easily the most polished alpha I've ever played. While it obviously has a long way to go it is in a very playable state.\n\nThings you need:\n\nA microphone. Silent players are dead weight and you'll likely be kicked from your squad for someone with a mic.\n\nA sense of teamwork. Lone wolf players will die and again, likely be kicked by their squad leader for not following orders.\n\nThis is not your typical run and gun shooter like Battlefield or Call of Duty.

The teamwork and the passion from the community make for some of the most memorable matches I've played in an FPS game, with a level of intensity that other games can only strive to replicate.\n\nThe game (especially the effects from explosions and bullet impacts) is, in my opinion, beautiful. While it still needs some optimization, I can assure you that the devs are passionate about improving the overall gameplay experience.\n\nPlease note that this game is NOT for the lone wolf type. Not only does failing to join a squad limit your choice of weapon loadout, but your ability to communicate will be severely limited and death is likely to find you quickly. Join a squad, listen to your squad leader's commands, and you will find the game both fun and rewarding.\n\nPros:\nCommunity\nGraphics and Effects\nDynamic Gameplay\nExcellent Built-in VOIP\nGunplay is far superior to games like ArmA (ArmA vet here)\nCons:\nCould use a bit more optimization, especially for AMD folks\nGet this game, join a Squad, and have fun!","December 15, 2015","true","37.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

The teamwork, community, and over all level of people wanting serious fun is absolutly incredible. There have been so many moments that have left me in awe. So many situations that have already made everlasting impressions. Above all, so many immensely fun games.\n\nI look forward to where Squad is heading.

Squad's goal is to get as close as possible to the goodness that is PR, now i have to warn you, this is still a ALPHA build, so that means bugs, glitches, lack of optimization and lack of content, this is a raw build on what the game could be. They are working hard on adding vehicles and if you follow their updates you would know they are nearly done with the Humvee's! An armored personnel carrier is also in the works! Some people have been complaining about the price, but don't forget that this money does not go into the pockets of the developers, its used for the game, so your money is backing up the development of this game.

Most of the time, I stay away from early acess titles, but after watching some people play it on twitch I decided to pick it up. Squad demands you to work as a team, becuase if you dont you will lose every time. In my opnion, Squad may be one of the best team-orenentied games avalible right now.\n\nPROS:\n\n+Game requires teamwork for you to succede, and because of this all the kiddies who think its another COD or Battlefield are quickly driven off.\n\n+Basebuilding mechanic is very cool\n\n+The battles you get into can range from small skirmishes to large conficts over a base. The battles are ver intense and diffrent every time.\n\n+The medical system is pretty cool, squads can have up to two medics, and to revive someone who is down you must first bandage their body then heal them with a medical bag. THe whole process takes ~90 seconds which makes healing someone in the middle of a battle much more intense.\n\n+1 sniper limit per squad, thank god\n\n+The sound quality is very good, bullets flying by sound amazing\n\n+The suppression system in this game isnt annoying like it is in games like Battlefield\n\n+Server sise is pretty nice, averging 64-72 player slots, it is *supposedley* goignt to be 100 slot servers when the game fully comes out\n\n+In my experience, about 90% of the players have mics, and 95% of the players are actually trying to play as a team.\n\nCONS\n\n-Early acess game\n\n-No vheicles YET\n\n-Cant drag bodies of teammates to cover YET\n\n-Guns are very limited for now, but i they may be more in the future\n\n-Spawn system is a little clunky\n\n-Not many maps for now, but im sure there will be more in future updates\n\nOVERALL\n\nIf you're like me and really enjoy military sims/ teamwork games this is a must buy. In short its an advanced, more teamwork oriented Arma without all the Arma ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and maps that are big enough to be interesting, but small enough that you will find people to fight against.\n\n8/10","January 1","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of the time, I stay away from early acess titles, but after watching some people play it on twitch I decided to pick it up. Squad demands you to work as a team, becuase if you dont you will lose every time. In my opnion, Squad may be one of the best team-orenentied games avalible right now.\n\nPROS:\n\n+Game requires teamwork for you to succede, and because of this all the kiddies who think its another COD or Battlefield are quickly driven off.\n\n+Basebuilding mechanic is very cool\n\n+The battles you get into can range from small skirmishes to large conficts over a base. The battles are ver intense and diffrent every time.\n\n+The medical system is pretty cool, squads can have up to two medics, and to revive someone who is down you must first bandage their body then heal them with a medical bag. THe whole process takes ~90 seconds which makes healing someone in the middle of a battle much more intense.\n\n+1 sniper limit per squad, thank god\n\n+The sound quality is very good, bullets flying by sound amazing\n\n+The suppression system in this game isnt annoying like it is in games like Battlefield\n\n+Server sise is pretty nice, averging 64-72 player slots, it is *supposedley* goignt to be 100 slot servers when the game fully comes out\n\n+In my experience, about 90% of the players have mics, and 95% of the players are actually trying to play as a team.\n\nCONS\n\n-Early acess game\n\n-No vheicles YET\n\n-Cant drag bodies of teammates to cover YET\n\n-Guns are very limited for now, but i they may be more in the future\n\n-Spawn system is a little clunky\n\n-Not many maps for now, but im sure there will be more in future updates\n\nOVERALL\n\nIf you're like me and really enjoy military sims/ teamwork games this is a must buy. In short its an advanced, more teamwork oriented Arma without all the Arma ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and maps that are big enough to be interesting, but small enough that you will find people to fight against.\n\n8/10","January 1","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It'd be nice to see more interesting teams (Finland VS Russia, Pakistan VS India, US VS South American Drug Cartels)\n\nFortunately, all of these cons are easily fixable with patches and DLC.

The teamwork needed to excel in this game is excellent as it brings alot more realism and stops alot of lone wolves thinking they can rambo their way through the enemy, this in not Cod and should not be played like it is, if you move as a squad & work together with your squad leaders you will overcome your enemy & taste sweet victory, if you choose to fight alone and disorganised you will help lead your squads to a quick defeat.\n\nI would recommend this game to all, although if some of the creators happen to read this i understand you have an enormous amount of work ahead of you & im very impressed with your current work, but if possible could you prioritze server security and stability as all servers seem to be getting DDOS & hacked at the moment & playability is almost impossible at this time, also the graphics could use some tweaks & to be optimized as i find mine to be blurry no matter what level i run it at from low to epic on some maps, but im sure you already have alot of that on the list, i really think people will apreaciate stable gameplay and an optimized display more at this stage in early development.\n\nWith that said keep up the great work & have a happy new year !\ni'll see you in the field.","December 26, 2015","true","181.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In short, what you hoped combat in Arma 3 would be.\n\nSome positives:\n>No top class, they all have their place.\n>Extremely team play focused.\n>Engagements are often long and exciting.\n>Firefights however are fast and bloody.\n>Locating and identifying contact is just the right level of difficult.\n>Maps are vast and offer many different approaches to objectives and multisquad coordination.\n>No kill indicator - this can sound like a pain but it adds a nice level of immersion, realism, and suspense - not being sure if you actually downed your contact.\n>Medics are done well. They can revive the team but will eventually run out of supplies to patch people up. Keeps from having those Arma revive contests.\n>Very clear VOIP chat - also squad based so you don't get the full team chatter you find in other games.\n\n\nSome negatives:\n>Server browser is a little sub par - not detremental but makes it a little more difficult to hook up with friends.\n>No in game friends list - little hard to drop in on a friend already playing as you need to actually locate the server in the browser.\n\ntldr: Great game, especially for Early Access.

You can play as squad leader, medic, light machine gunner, rifleman, grenadier or rpg'r.  This is a game that really requires that players work together.  Squad lives up to it's name there.  Squad leaders can coordinate defence or attacks with other squads or work on their own.  SL's can place rally point's and forward operating base's.  As well as hesco's barbed wire and sandbags.  In other words, you can improve defences anywhere you want.  It's more of a simulation than most other shooters so if it's realism you want then this is your game.  In closing ...

The concept of the game sounds absolutely fantastic; and as someone who had never played project reality, I had no idea what to expect.\n\nI spawned in on the USA side and quickly learned the buttons to speak to squad. The UI is fairly easy to work out: how to join a team, how to join a squad, where to spawn, what your role is etc. So anyway, I'm in the map now and start running toward my squad. Little do I know that I've spawned into the middle of a battle and bang I'm dead from an unknown enemy in an unknown position. "Ok" I think, this isn't as fast paced as I expected... Spawn in again, run over to my squad and die again. "This game is ♥♥♥♥, I'm getting a refund" I now think.\n\nThank God I did not refund.\n\nAfter a bit of a learning curve, primarily because I'm totally new to games like this, I started to learn the tactics necessary behind the game. There are many! Once you become familiar with the game modes and the style of the game, its cracking fun. Playing the medic is satisfying getting your team mates up. Firing an RPG from a hilltop on an enemy base is exhilirating fun! The sounds in the game are amazing. The authenticity is really commendable. The more I play it, the more I enjoy it and I definitely recommend picking it up, even if the price point is a bit steep.\n\nCons wise I can't fault it too much. Optics for the russian/non-USA guns would be very welcomed. More maps and game modes would equally be good, as well as perhaps more customisation allowed for the loadouts. For example, it would be great to have the option to take an extra nade instead of my pistol. I also have encountered a few bugs, but for an alpha its suprisingly stable. If your team or SL is ♥♥♥♥, then you're in for a rough time of aimless wandering in a huge map.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game. It takes a while to get used to it, and it can be really frustrating sometimes when under fire from positions unknown or your SL is ♥♥♥♥. But then when you have a good round, or an epic firefight it provides a satisfaction that not many other games can do. I look forward to the full release.","January 21","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The teamwork needed to excel in this game is excellent as it brings alot more realism and stops alot of lone wolves thinking they can rambo their way through the enemy, this in not Cod and should not be played like it is, if you move as a squad & work together with your squad leaders you will overcome your enemy & taste sweet victory, if you choose to fight alone and disorganised you will help lead your squads to a quick defeat.\n\nI would recommend this game to all, although if some of the creators happen to read this i understand you have an enormous amount of work ahead of you & im very impressed with your current work, but if possible could you prioritze server security and stability as all servers seem to be getting DDOS & hacked at the moment & playability is almost impossible at this time, also the graphics could use some tweaks & to be optimized as i find mine to be blurry no matter what level i run it at from low to epic on some maps, but im sure you already have alot of that on the list, i really think people will apreaciate stable gameplay and an optimized display more at this stage in early development.\n\nWith that said keep up the great work & have a happy new year !\ni'll see you in the field.","December 26, 2015","true","181.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a good game if you want to play with no presure. Community is cool and dying is so realistic that no one is mad if you die. The fact that this is just early access is great because it is already a good game.\n\nI just hope there will be some actual progretion or something in this game because right now there is nothing to unlock or ranks to get so it makes the game feel a little meaningless.","January 13","true","29.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a game that requires patience & good communication.  Has a learning curve to it, took some time and tutorial browsing to get more familiar with the features, objectives, etc.\n\nCouple bugs I've encountered, mainly crashes (Typically after a match).  Some frame dips, poor server browser UI, no tutorial system for new players (Unlesss you search it up), and some other small things I dislike.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/d2600/recommended/393380/","d2600","Never Nude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/d2600/","218 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPositive review for now. But read before you buy.\n\nPretty much the child of Arma 3 and Insurgancy you have always wanted;  infected with ideas from CoD, CS, and BF4\n\nLike the BF series, much like the original Project Reality, this game needs to decide what it wants to be. Too often does it flip flop between wanting to be a super intelligent tactical FPS and a twitchy arcade fps shooter. While its end goal is to be hybrid of arcade and simulation, Currently, it is not a happy marrige. This game has a chaince to be a unique tactical game, but too often allows itself to become another run around and shoot until you die and respawn.  The ideas in this game often fight eachother. I hope they can decide what they want this to be before they hit beta.\n\nThe Good:\n1. Perfect Sized Maps for the number of players.\n2. Sometimes you get a great feeling of tactical realism, squad vs squad fire fights can be very fun!\n3. Very Polished for an Alpha, showing great potential\n4. When you have a group of 35vs35 people playing the game "right" it is super fun.\n5. Damage System is fair, 6. stamina system is great, 7. weapons handle pretty realistically,8 . class balance feels good.\n\nThis game has a lot going for it. BUT\n\n\nThe Bad:\n1. Game all too often turns into typcial, Battlefeid type, "place rally points: capture flags by attrition" gameplay.\n2. The tools for proper team play aren't there, (no planning phase, no map drawing, no custom objective, etc). You can't do anything about people on the server who refuse to play as a team (no vote kick).\n3. Death penalty is too minimal; little incentive to wait for a medic. No way to prevent non-teamplayers from wasting team tickets.\n4. At first listen, the sound is excellent. However positional audio doesn't have an Obstruction System,  so terrian/object doesn't matter, only distance, making for some weird sounding situations when you hear an enemy firing from behind a wall right next to you. Radio doesn't have distortion either. You can't hear enemy players on local voice chat (choice by the dev, they think everyone will use team speak).\n5. Basebuilding is super fun, but doesn't serve a real purpose right now.\n5. Community can be extreamly abrasive. According to many of them,  the Devs have the perfect game in mind, they ask for feedback but don't want to hear it unless it is what they want to hear.\n\nFor me, the game breaker is the rally points. They flip the dial too far to the arcade side, and as aforementioned, they switch the strategy from tactics to spamming and attrition.  While there may be a better way to fix them, it would be as simple as changing it to a paradrop (instead of people spawning out of a backpack). I don't know how the current rally point/spawn system would be compabilty with veichals (people would just spam spawning anti-tank). So hope it's a place holder.\n\nAlso, the over-embellished gameplay stories many fans have been posting in the reviews are just setting unrealistic expectations for the game. this game will not give you PTSD (thats not even a funny thing to joke about).\n\nBut it's still fun. I like these kind of Games, so I went for it. Hoping it turns out great.","January 18","true","106.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a tactical shooter that you can drop right into and have fun in without the constant need to make excuses on why "it's fun when it works." It just feels much more realistic and logical.

Tired of glitching around in Arma 3, not knowing if your FPS will plummet the next moment? Then this game is for you. I streamed this game for about 4 hours yesterday and had a blast. Being Early Access, there are a few rough edges here and there but with the quality of AAA games now-a-days this is on par with their full release quality.\n\nGameplay:\n\n- Until today I had not truly felt what it was like to leave a man behind.\n\n"I was playing a medic, and we had advanced to a small hill with some buildings on it. The enemy force started an organized counter attack and started pushing up the hill. Our squad leader yelled frantically to PULL BACK NOW! And while I worked away trying to revive my friend, I had to eventually stand up and run."\n\nThis game has a lot of flavor for such a tried, and tried again style of game (Arma 3, Insurgency, etc...). I can easily say I'd rather play this. It's not quite as large scale as Arma 3 (multiple maps, not one large island) but it makes up for it in much more intense fighting, a large community at the time of this writing, and the fact that nearly everyone I played with was using a microphone.\n\nThat being said I had a couple issues. One problem was the icons on the map are pretty hard to see, especially when trying to find a spawn point. They are so small and no doubt realistic feeling that it was a chore to figure out for a bit. Additionally it's really hard to get the names of points to pop up when mousing over them. These were really the only issues I found. There seem to be some discussions of FPS issues floating around, I can say I averaged 40 FPS which is pretty low considering my system, but it was playable and I still had a blast.\n\nI'd highly recommend it, even as a "just launched" early access game. I can't wait until vehicles are added, (confirmed) such as HMMWV's and helicopters.

If you like intensly realistic tactical squad based action then you should pick this one up. There is a bit of a learning curve as it is a very in depth game based on the project reality action, but once you get your feet wet you will feel a bit more relaxed. Enjoy the lovely graphics and incredible sound and try to ignore the spike lags as it is still in alpha stage. Hopefully as time goes by the spike lag will be minamized.

Tired of glitching around in Arma 3, not knowing if your FPS will plummet the next moment? Then this game is for you. I streamed this game for about 4 hours yesterday and had a blast. Being Early Access, there are a few rough edges here and there but with the quality of AAA games now-a-days this is on par with their full release quality.\n\nGameplay:\n\n- Until today I had not truly felt what it was like to leave a man behind.\n\n"I was playing a medic, and we had advanced to a small hill with some buildings on it. The enemy force started an organized counter attack and started pushing up the hill. Our squad leader yelled frantically to PULL BACK NOW! And while I worked away trying to revive my friend, I had to eventually stand up and run."\n\nThis game has a lot of flavor for such a tried, and tried again style of game (Arma 3, Insurgency, etc...). I can easily say I'd rather play this. It's not quite as large scale as Arma 3 (multiple maps, not one large island) but it makes up for it in much more intense fighting, a large community at the time of this writing, and the fact that nearly everyone I played with was using a microphone.\n\nThat being said I had a couple issues. One problem was the icons on the map are pretty hard to see, especially when trying to find a spawn point. They are so small and no doubt realistic feeling that it was a chore to figure out for a bit. Additionally it's really hard to get the names of points to pop up when mousing over them. These were really the only issues I found. There seem to be some discussions of FPS issues floating around, I can say I averaged 40 FPS which is pretty low considering my system, but it was playable and I still had a blast.\n\nI'd highly recommend it, even as a "just launched" early access game. I can't wait until vehicles are added, (confirmed) such as HMMWV's and helicopters. See you all on the battlefield!\n\n- Signed Laughinwhale (twitch.tv/laughinwhale , come hang out if you want to play!)","December 16, 2015","true","13.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is the game where the objective should matter more than just the kills, like in PR. If you are used to other FPS games, the thing first you should know, that you will have to work with your squad and follow your squadlead's orders and plans. A full and coordinated squad can do more than just a lone guy.\n\nFor an early access title, basic features are implemented and it'll run ok in multiplayer, if you have a somewhat good PC with intel CPU and Nvidia GPU. As these guys developed Project Reality mod for BF2 for free in their spare time. Squad will have constant updates a lot more faster compared to PR as the devs are getting paid to do so.\n\nI love the sound effects as they sound very realistic, but for the sake of possibly losing your hearing you might want to lower the volume down, it still sounds as awesome after that.\n\nThis is the game for those fellas who want more teamwork based gameplay, as usually in BF and cod sort of games you really don't need teamwork to win. Once you learn the habits of how you should play Squad, the experience of the game will improve a lot.\n\nI've played FPS games for a long time, but Project Reality and Squad are my favorites now, Arma holds it's own place, but not so so much for PvP Team VS Team aspect. I will recommend this game for those who are willing to play an early access game and like the more realistic take on intense FPS PvP combat with a lot of teamwork.","December 16, 2015","true","214.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The first beautiful notes rung throughout the hills as he began the Christmas tune. At the same time as those notes began, enemy fire started to rain down on us. I never strode into battle to such a joyous tune.\n\nOne by one our squad members fell to the ground. Seeing no hope left, surrounded by enemies, our squad leader pulled the pin on his grenade and charged forward, blowing himself up, bewildering our foes, in a final blaze of glory as the last note rung throughout the hills.\n\n10/10 Best Community Ever.","December 26, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It is, hands down, the best co-op tactical game ever made. If you liked Insurgency for the teamwork and communication but thought it left a lot to be desired, then Squad is for you.\n\nYou can not lone wolf (we'll kick you anyway if you try). Youre tied to your squad. Every role (class) is equally important. That is something that no game to date has truly achieved. Well, its here. You know how every n00b likes to be a "sniper"? Not here. Those n00bs will be bored with that role after a few minutes. We need real recon. And that is what we get. Heck, if youre furstrated with every game that has n00bs rushing in to be snipers to get kills from long range (because they have no skill) then this game is for you. Just the releif from that well-known scenario in multiplayer FPS is woth the price. On my last trip with SL Tomabova (Toma18) we moved the entire squad around the southside of an enemy squad. Our goal was to find their Rally Points (spawn points) and FOB's (Forward operating Bases) and destroy them. They were hitting the objective our team was guarding so fast that they had to be close. So, here is where the n00b snipers will quit...our snipers hang back. They watch. Real recon. When there is a lone guy SL gives the call to take him out. One shot. Its over. We found the FOB and used our shovels to dig it up. We tracked the enemy as a squad. We eliminated the immediate threat. And then time for the good part, what everyone in the Squad has been waiting for...\n\nThe other squads radio back to Toma18. The last wave of spawns (the ones that spwaned in while we were moving on their flank) has made it to the objective and is hitting it hard. Now we are in a great position. By following the same line to the objective the enmy wont look at us twice. If they see movement from behind they think its their team mates. A deadly supposition to make.\n\nWe wipe the squad. Its game over now. Toma18 says [sic] "I love being the one squad that comes out of nowhere and wipes everyone out in seconds". Second.\n\nI havent even mentioned all the great stuff like base and reinforcement building. It has everything. Vehicles are coming. It has a learning curve but it isnt steep. Join us. Hop in and dontbe afraid to ask questions. If you see Socrates in a Squad join that squad and he'll have you acting like a seasoned player in minutes.

The teamwork in this game makes it really fun and the sounds are sharp as a blade. the guns play is amazing, it feels as if you are actually behind it when you pull the trigger. CQB and house to house is amazing and adrenaline filled as you are genuinly try not to die, partly to not run half way across the map to get to your squad. when vehicles are released it will make this game a whole lot more fun as running everywhere is the most thrilling thing ive ever done. But this game in general really is amazing, its so immersive and it definatly gets the blood pumping. 9/10 id say because of the lack if transport but when we get them and theres a few little things ironed out it will be amazing, far better than its predecessor, PR which is was also a big fan of.","December 28, 2015","true","56.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Very tactical and fun. Needs optimization, and dedicated servers.\n\n\nThough this is reliant on a good squad and squad-mates. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ squad leader will lead to the game turning into a running simulator, and have also noticed a lot of trolls in the game. Militia and Russian's need optics though. Not fair to be getting picked off by the US from a mile away while the iron-sights you have can barley see 100ft. And the US does not have a sniper, seems like they tried to equal it out with militia and Russia having no optics while the US does but with no sniper, it doesn't make sense. Gun sounds are amazing, nothing like not being able to hear your team-mates talk when you have a m249 in your ear. Player models are similar and hard to tell friendly's from contacts.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/d2600/recommended/393380/","d2600","Never Nude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/d2600/","218 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPositive review for now. But read before you buy.\n\nPretty much the child of Arma 3 and Insurgancy you have always wanted;  infected with ideas from CoD, CS, and BF4\n\nLike the BF series, much like the original Project Reality, this game needs to decide what it wants to be. Too often does it flip flop between wanting to be a super intelligent tactical FPS and a twitchy arcade fps shooter. While its end goal is to be hybrid of arcade and simulation, Currently, it is not a happy marrige. This game has a chaince to be a unique tactical game, but too often allows itself to become another run around and shoot until you die and respawn.  The ideas in this game often fight eachother. I hope they can decide what they want this to be before they hit beta.\n\nThe Good:\n1. Perfect Sized Maps for the number of players.\n2. Sometimes you get a great feeling of tactical realism, squad vs squad fire fights can be very fun!\n3. Very Polished for an Alpha, showing great potential\n4. When you have a group of 35vs35 people playing the game "right" it is super fun.\n5. Damage System is fair, 6. stamina system is great, 7. weapons handle pretty realistically,8 . class balance feels good.\n\nThis game has a lot going for it. BUT\n\n\nThe Bad:\n1. Game all too often turns into typcial, Battlefeid type, "place rally points: capture flags by attrition" gameplay.\n2. The tools for proper team play aren't there, (no planning phase, no map drawing, no custom objective, etc). You can't do anything about people on the server who refuse to play as a team (no vote kick).\n3. Death penalty is too minimal; little incentive to wait for a medic. No way to prevent non-teamplayers from wasting team tickets.\n4. At first listen, the sound is excellent. However positional audio doesn't have an Obstruction System,  so terrian/object doesn't matter, only distance, making for some weird sounding situations when you hear an enemy firing from behind a wall right next to you. Radio doesn't have distortion either. You can't hear enemy players on local voice chat (choice by the dev, they think everyone will use team speak).\n5. Basebuilding is super fun, but doesn't serve a real purpose right now.\n5. Community can be extreamly abrasive. According to many of them,  the Devs have the perfect game in mind, they ask for feedback but don't want to hear it unless it is what they want to hear.\n\nFor me, the game breaker is the rally points. They flip the dial too far to the arcade side, and as aforementioned, they switch the strategy from tactics to spamming and attrition.  While there may be a better way to fix them, it would be as simple as changing it to a paradrop (instead of people spawning out of a backpack). I don't know how the current rally point/spawn system would be compabilty with veichals (people would just spam spawning anti-tank). So hope it's a place holder.\n\nAlso, the over-embellished gameplay stories many fans have been posting in the reviews are just setting unrealistic expectations for the game. this game will not give you PTSD (thats not even a funny thing to joke about).\n\nBut it's still fun. I like these kind of Games, so I went for it. Hoping it turns out great.","January 18","true","106.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Tired of glitching around in Arma 3, not knowing if your FPS will plummet the next moment? Then this game is for you. I streamed this game for about 4 hours yesterday and had a blast. Being Early Access, there are a few rough edges here and there but with the quality of AAA games now-a-days this is on par with their full release quality.\n\nGameplay:\n\n- Until today I had not truly felt what it was like to leave a man behind.\n\n"I was playing a medic, and we had advanced to a small hill with some buildings on it. The enemy force started an organized counter attack and started pushing up the hill. Our squad leader yelled frantically to PULL BACK NOW! And while I worked away trying to revive my friend, I had to eventually stand up and run."\n\nThis game has a lot of flavor for such a tried, and tried again style of game (Arma 3, Insurgency, etc...). I can easily say I'd rather play this. It's not quite as large scale as Arma 3 (multiple maps, not one large island) but it makes up for it in much more intense fighting, a large community at the time of this writing, and the fact that nearly everyone I played with was using a microphone.\n\nThat being said I had a couple issues. One problem was the icons on the map are pretty hard to see, especially when trying to find a spawn point. They are so small and no doubt realistic feeling that it was a chore to figure out for a bit. Additionally it's really hard to get the names of points to pop up when mousing over them. These were really the only issues I found. There seem to be some discussions of FPS issues floating around, I can say I averaged 40 FPS which is pretty low considering my system, but it was playable and I still had a blast.\n\nI'd highly recommend it, even as a "just launched" early access game. I can't wait until vehicles are added, (confirmed) such as HMMWV's and helicopters. See you all on the battlefield!\n\n- Signed Laughinwhale (twitch.tv/laughinwhale , come hang out if you want to play!)","December 16, 2015","true","13.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Learning curve is massive and requires quick learning, quick twich reactions, 100% teamwork/communication and most importantly patience.\n\nI started taking squad lead position about 18 hours in after learning the basics of the game, and watching way too many bad SL's getting their guys wiped out mostly out of reluctant incompetence, It becomes night and day how to play the game when you have a SL that knows wtf they're doing, and actively gives a hoot about their guys getting hit and downed by the enemy.\n\nI find the human interactions at the start of the round pretty awesome, guys talking about random shet that has nothing to do with the task at hand laughing it up full well knowing the poop's about to hit the fan. However when you have a squad of fully commited guys willing to work together as a team, point out enemy bearings, and trust their SL requardless of situation, this game gives off one of the most rewarding feelings when you set it down. Personally I get the feeling as,"Yeah, we just fuqd shet up for 40 minutes, lets do that again."\n\nNow is it worth $40? I can see where people wouldn't say yes, "It's an alpha game with a singular gameplay, optimized like crap, just another take on BF4 conquest" In all reality it's worth full sticker price of a finished game. Looks beautiful, realistic, (for a video game) controls are simple yet precise, and gameplay that's extremely stressful and addictive. The regulars playing the game atm take this game as hardcore as I've seen gaming get. You really need to play the game to understand how special this game is. I highly suggest this game to any honest hardcore FPS gamers who are itching for the next big thing. Give the game a dozen hours and honestly tell me I'm dead wrong.\n\n*TO THE DEVS*\nDon't fuq this game up, you have created something truly special to the genre here and I'm sure there's already thousands of dedicated fans backing the growth and production of this game in the coming years. Don't become the next Day-Z toss-up.","February 3","true","173.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I can't believe this is in "Early-Alpha".  WHAT?!  I am a very seasoned gamer, and I can say that hands down this is the best realism you can find in any FPS out there.  If you enjoyed Arma, Project Reality, or just weren't feeling the arcade-like gameplay of games like Battlefield, you NEED to try this game.\n\nThe firefights are INTENSE.  You feel fear when you are surrounded by an enemy in a compound, or are clearing said compound.\n\nThe graphics and environment are great, and it really looks like the mud huts and poppy fields in the mountainous terrain in Afghanistan.\n\nTwo thumbs WAY up!!!

I was really interested in getting this game for a while already, the moment was finally there!\n\nI join a server, as well as a decent looking squad with 2 clan members. I was nervous as a bag of d1cks because all kinds of things were still very unknown to me; how are the people in the community in a random round in a random squad, can I pull my own weight, do I know enough already about the game to really benefit my squad and the team?\n\nTurns out I really did not have to worry. I silently linked up with the squad leader after spawning in and basically just followed him and the rest of the squad around, moving from position to position, giving covering fire, keeping an eye out for contacts and so on. All the while getting more and more in communication with the various helpful, kind and cool deviants from the squad.\n\nMy confidence about my capability's was starting to grow and mayng, was I going to need it.\n\nOur squad was the one who had to capture and defend the ruins that is Castle. We spread out accordingly and even set up a support detachment on the ridge next to castle so we'd have a lot more sightlines on the place and some great covering fire. Slowly but surely enemies started to appear and trickle in. I was perched in one of the higher structures in Castle so I had good vision over the place as well as some good cover from the direction we knew the enemies were coming from. And massively attack they finally did, with multiple squads.\n\nIt was complete carnage in the castle. Thrilling, adrenaline pumping, PTSD inducing close quarters combat. For at least 10 minutes, it was insane. Bullets flying around all over the place, grenades going off everywhere. Slowly but surely our numbers were dwindling giving out loud screams wherever they fell. Nonetheless, we were making it incredibly hard for the enemy to push up and set up an effective position. Our medics risked everything to just, try and keep as many as they could alive.\n\nThe supporting fire from the ridge made it so the enemy couldn't really push on my position and I in turn was able to make it very hard for them to find good cover to do anything with. They were pinned in castle. This did not stop them from flanking attacks, using smoke to move in cover, using the little bits of cover they had left as best they could to fire back at us. They were giving it everything to get Castle.\n\nAfter spending almost all of the ammunition in my weapons, sweating like a pig and shaking from the adrenaline, we had won! The enemy team ran out of tickets because of the ferocity of the fighting in that round, as well as our succesfull attempt to defend Castle.\n\nI sat back in my chair in awe, feeling spent because of this first round. I was actually the top player on the server on points by far since I was defending from inside the capzone, and our squad was the top squad. My kd was only 5-2, definitly not the most kills in my squad, but my role in being there on that little perch in that godforsaken castle was (at least it really felt and looked like it) crucial. And that was fckn amazing.\n\nSo, I can truly recommend this game already in it's alpha state. I played a couple of other rounds after that on different servers and had similar experiences each time.\n\nThe immersion is great, the people are pretty dang cool, strategy and communication completely win games and that is so incredibly satisfying to experience and play with. The graphics are pretty good as well I must say, the sounds are awesome.\n\nI'm really looking forward to all the updates and how this game is going to develop. There's still a lot of things that aren't fully fleshed out or functioning, but from what I've seen the developers are doing an awesome job updating it. The game itself is really stable for me but if you're an AMD user, wait till they've fixed the problems with it.\n\nIt's like a huge complicated chessgame, you can chose the role you play and how you go about defeating the enemy with your squad and team. It's completely up to you. If you even remotely love anything that comes closes to that, Squad will probably be a great thing to add to your life.\n\nLove it!","March 10","true","35.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'm still going to recommend it, because that's not the developer's fault. I play this game for the teamwork and cooperation, and you often find good people, many of whom I've added on Steam. Unfortunately, the bad ruins the experience for me completely; and after playing with a group in ARMA 3 and in Mount and Blade, I don't think I can handle some of the negative nature of public servers. This isn't the game developer's fault in any way, but it's just how it is when things go mainstream.\n\nEver since this game came out on Steam, the community has seen a steady drop in etiquette and behavior. More and more, I see players lashing out at the squad leader angrily for not putting down a rally point when they physically can't. A lot of it has to do with young, immature teenagers. While I've met mature ones, most of them fall under the stereotype of angry Call of Duty players. If you can stomach it after gaming for several hours, great.

Medics that can pick up and heal downed and wounded players -- support units bring machinegun suppression and grenade and rocket launchers to dominate dug in enemies.\n\nI wasn't expecting this game to be this good, especially not in such an early stage of development.

I'm still going to recommend it, because that's not the developer's fault. I play this game for the teamwork and cooperation, and you often find good people, many of whom I've added on Steam. Unfortunately, the bad ruins the experience for me completely; and after playing with a group in ARMA 3 and in Mount and Blade, I don't think I can handle some of the negative nature of public servers. This isn't the game developer's fault in any way, but it's just how it is when things go mainstream.\n\nEver since this game came out on Steam, the community has seen a steady drop in etiquette and behavior. More and more, I see players lashing out at the squad leader angrily for not putting down a rally point when they physically can't. A lot of it has to do with young, immature teenagers. While I've met mature ones, most of them fall under the stereotype of angry Call of Duty players. If you can stomach it after gaming for several hours, great.

It draws on it's roots of BF2 with a focused MP experience unlike ARMA but much more challanging and deep than any recent Battlefield game. The maps all have a good feel to them, offering varying experiences and don't get old. The sound is top notch and probably the best in any game I've heard, the eary sound of a long off fire fight the time it take sound to travel and the crack of a bullet that makes you jump out of your seat, the audio is damn close to the real deal as you can get with out setting foot onto a range. The visual effects are beautiful and well thought out, the lingering dust that's been kicked up from a rocket or grenade making the desert maps feel dry and dirty or a tracer flying over head or pointing out a potential threat.\n\nEven in it's earliest stages, SQUAD has been well worth the price and is getting better with every update that has been released.","December 15, 2015","true","122.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I broke down and got it finally =P. I know the price is high, but wow I havnt had this much fun in a while playing a FPS like this. I'm enjoying this game tons! This is coming from someone who has play 1000's of hours of CS:go, BF4, Arma2: OA - takistan mod, and Arma 3 takistan and ton other mods... life, wasteland, battle royale, KoTH. You get the drift.....\n\nPros-\n-The Very Best VOIP system and voice quality in any FPS. Yah beats out CS:go and makes Arma 3 voip sound like a joke.(No more need for teamspeak nazis demanding you to join their teamspeak or they kick you to clearly hear them, LOL!)\n-Awesome gun visual & sounds. Explosion effects really are NICE.\n-Squad members really have been communicating a lot in game which makes it really intense during tense moments.\n-UE4 engine implemented well and looks really good and runs smooth. 35-40 fps on my old quad with 770 gtx on high settings.\n-Various maps with realistic layouts.\n-Not a shity sniper fest! =) 4x Asoc optics limited to 2 per team.\n-Squad leader can build bases! and fellow squad members can help build up placed objects.\n\nCons-\n-My screen has been flashing black for a millisecond  when I first sight in or fire my gun after respawning.\n-No teamfire regulation yet. =( Teamkillers... ♥♥♥♥ YOU learn to use your M key to see whos in front of you first.\n-No 50 v 50 yet.\n-Hard to tell Russian vs American troop skins in some maps, making more undesired TK's.\n-USA servers are limited and hard to get into right now.\n\nSolutions that would help Squad. (More will be added as I test this game out)\n\nThey should make the map not take up your whole screen when viewing it. Maybe make it like Arma's GPS setup, where the map is just in one corner and can be viewed while engaged in combat. This will be better because you can view other teamates location very easily before just blasting anything that moves.\n\nMy Conlusion of Squad\n\nOverall I give this game a 9.5 out of 10. I know this game is only around 1 month old and Early access and I'm still very impressed. I recommend this game completely and would love to see more USA servers out! This game defently has lots of potential and will be very interesting to see the implication vehicles have on Squads overall gameplay value.","January 8","true","23.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

This game is basically arma but in a call of duty kind of way; It is team deathmatch aswell as capturing certain points across the whole map, and speaking of the maps there is a verioty of them and they are all huge free roaming maps which makes the games way more intense, but fun at the same time. To win a game you have to use tactics and stratagies and you have to communicte with you team members or your "squad". There is a base building system which allows you to create bunkers and create barrikades so you are protected through out a battle. And if you die you can either respawn after afew seconds of waiting, or you can wait for a medic to revive you. There is also a leader board so you can see how you are doing personally or how your whole team are doing. There is a wide selection of weapons and classes to choose from and they are all made to meet different standards. Over all i think this game is going to be very big and will have a tun of more features added sooner or later; I would say it should be a little bit cheaper as it is 29.99 uk pounds which is alot for a game in first stages of alpha release and i think it should be lowered to about 15 or 20 uk pounds as it would suit the game better. But i do understand that they need more money to improve the game even more. I would reccomend buying this game if you like army simulator, fps, mmp, and adventure games. :D :)","December 16, 2015","true","8.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Slight server lag accross all servers  in terms of ping. but they'll fix that. I have only seen 1 spike in my 7.6 hours of gameplay currently.

Sound system is amazing. Medic system is very simple and works extremely well, build system is very well integrated and works awesome, and the maps and environments are insanely awesome. It easily takes the best out of both games and runs with it and wins the race by far. The only problem so far is bad FPS dips, I run at around ~30 fps, but it dips every 3 seconds down to 15 and back to 30 which is causing my screen to jerk, and in firefights it does it a lot and causes me to die most of the time, but overall, I am enjoying the hell out of this title and it's only in Alpha, once they get the FPS problems fixed then it's gonna be perfect!!

The way I play the game at the moment is going solo: Taking the long flank around the enemy, which of course no body ever covers, You'll most likely ending up behind 7 players all shooting away from You, usually all sitting in one position, killing them with one grenade. It really works almost every time, I end games with about 5 k/d ratio by playing completely alone. So much for "promoting teamwork"\n\nThe people using microphones are few, and from those that do use, many will never listen to eachother during combat, only speak themselves. Just today I've had a squad of 5 players, 4 of them around the same area playing together, and one guy on the other side of the map who keeps relaying his contacts over squad chat, with a Redneck American Milsim™ voice. I told him that the fact that he's communicating a lot is great, but also that his reports are absolutely useless for us when he's completely alone, 2km away from the squad, which I wasn't sure if he realized. I tried explaining that his "Your 300" is not our "300",  He replied that "300 is 300 no matter if you're British or American, its an azimuth". He then went on to bully me for my accent.

Sound system is amazing. Medic system is very simple and works extremely well, build system is very well integrated and works awesome, and the maps and environments are insanely awesome. It easily takes the best out of both games and runs with it and wins the race by far. The only problem so far is bad FPS dips, I run at around ~30 fps, but it dips every 3 seconds down to 15 and back to 30 which is causing my screen to jerk, and in firefights it does it a lot and causes me to die most of the time, but overall, I am enjoying the hell out of this title and it's only in Alpha, once they get the FPS problems fixed then it's gonna be perfect!! Right now I would give it probably a good 7.5 out of ten because the FPS issue does take a lot out of the game because it is an FPS afterall, but still a good buy for an Early Access game and very enjoyable!!!!","December 15, 2015","true","28.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I love the gunplay, it feels very good to shoot the different guns ingame. It's easy to get in to, even though it has a lot to offer.\n\nThe developers are working very closely with the community, and it is great to see that in a market full of unfinished and abandoned Early Access games. Many of the developers are coming from the Project Reality mod, and they know gaming, they know how important communication, and later on modding, is for a game to live on for many years.\n\nI recommend this game for those who like PR, Arma, or just want to get in to a more tactical game rather than Battlefield or Insurgency. Some might need to hold off though because of performance issues on some rigs, and the fact that the game does not have all the content yet.\n\nBut for me, this is the game. THE game.\n\nThis is not a full review, but I wanted to share some of my thoughts so far on Squad, and in the future I'll hopefully update this review to fit the progress of the game.","December 15, 2015","true","13.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Slight server lag accross all servers  in terms of ping. but they'll fix that. I have only seen 1 spike in my 7.6 hours of gameplay currently.

Maps are well designed and provide challenging combat situations. Role-systems are good and easy to use. Compared to ArmA maps Squad looks a bit low detailed, yet.\nOne major plus is the well working VoIP chat.

Fearing I was going to be let somewhat down, I started the game up for its first run.\n\nI was not let down. My initial thought was, and still is, that it's a sort of mix between Insurgency and the Arma series. I think in a lot of ways, the game will address itself to both groups of players.\nIt has the simple controls and management of Insurgency, but at the same time offers combined arma warfare in a scale similar to Arma, not to mention that the maps are quite large, and the different fireteam roles actually matter in this game.\nThe ability to set up outposts as spawnpoints, and the need for a tactical plan, is something that appeals to me in this game. While some might feel the urge to go Rambo in the game, you could say that there is no room within fireteam for such actions. Fireteam tactics and coop play are a priority when playing this game.\n\nThe game has quite good graphics, and will appeal to those looking for something more serious than COD of BF, but without losing the simple control scheme. The game also offers in-game VoIP, letting you utilize three different radio channels, one for direct chat, one for fireteam chat, and one for company chat.\n\nAll in all this is a game I look forward to playing a lot more, and also seeing what the future has in store for. I highly recommend this game if you like playing Insurgency, but maybe want a little more realism, or if you're an Arma player looking for a similar experience, but without the Arma problems. (If you're an Arma player, you'll know what I mean).","December 15, 2015","true","5.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

And knowing their plans in the future, seeing the monthly progress updates, i can say that this game could even be worth 100 Euros/Dollars/GBP once it is finished.\n\nThe teamwork isn't up to par yet with my experiences from Project Reality, but that is to be expected with at least half the players being kind of, or completely new to this type of gameplay.\n\nNo vehicles yet, but i didn't expect there to be any, considering they had to be coded from scratch, in a new game engine that doesn't really have that much ground yet to stand on.\n\nThe gunplay is solid, and firefights are absolutely chaotic, and fun.\n\nThis is an alpha, which should be pretty clear to people who were not told in advance. There are glitches and bugs and unfinished things, which is to be expected. But so far, this alpha is already better than alot of beta's that i've experienced, or released games.\n\n\nFor the old veterans i do have a request, don't get angry with the new players who don't know what to do yet, but instead teach them how stuff gets done! Take the role of Squad leader and help the newbies with understanding the game better, that way not only the game, but community itself will only improve alot in the future.\n\nMy final verdict for Squad so far is a solid 10/10!\n","December 17, 2015","true","11.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

If hes not important for them, anyones gonna take that slot and is never going to get "kicked out" of it, making the position useless.\n\nB - Marks on the map\n\nJust look at the system in ArmA, if you make a system like that it would really help the game.\nSome squadleaders there make real paths for their fireteams on the map (Invade and Annex modes), so everyone really knows what their doing and where their heading. Having knowledge of the game or not.\n\n\n\nNow to my refund reason.\nMostly its communication. People are not forced to communicate enough, some are, most are not.\n\nI simply had no fun at the current state, though I WILL consider buying it again, if I see some improvements in the future, but for now i want to spend my money otherwise.\n\nThe review is positive because i can't justify giving it a no vote.\nThat is simply not what this game deserves, my refund is as you've probably read NOT about the game itself beeing "♥♥♥♥", but it missing things that i want to see in a game like this, that i need to actually enjoy it.\n\nI can just tell the devs and others to look at ArmA 3 servers in the server filter "coop mode".\nGreat teamplay on some of them, you could get some ideas from then to make your game better. ;)","January 8","true","1.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Well first of all Squad is a very easily accesible game,  unlike other shooters like ARMA for example,  where if you want to get around 60-100 players in a good scenario mission and then also be coordinated and communicate with something like ACRE or Task force radio mods  you almost always have to be in a milsim community and schedule events for such things to get that experience.\nBut with Squad all you have to do is just join up on any offical or community ran public server with good admin moderation, to get that experience since the gamemodes and mechanics in Squad are all very well made to kinda force that kind of gameplay and interaction with other from the get go, (Built in Local voip and radio channels through built in mumble to the game) ( Very harsh penalties to getting shot and dying) (Almost all objectives require more people too accomplish/capture) if you start running around and trying to lonewolf you will not have a very good time and most likely die very much and not accomplish anything good for the team.\n\nNow Squad isnt exactly a milsim shooter,  but it tries to bridge the gap between a pretty realistic military shooter and still a fairly simple game in terms of understanding and controls and it wont sacrifice any good gameplay just too add in something that would be more realistic,  it still wants to be a fun game to play in the core,  It wants to be both realstic and fun at the same time!\n\nThe current main gamemodes in Squad are Insurgency and AAS, which if you have played PR previously you are probably pretty familiar with them,  In AAS you have to capture flags in a specific order, and which locations are also dynamically set after each start of the round,  and the amount of flags that are in play may also be just one are several,  and in AAS theres also always one flag that you have to defend or attack. which creates some really unqiue and interesting gameplay.\n\nIn Insurgency the goal for blufor is to find enemy weapon caches that are unmarked on the map until you gain enough intelligence by killing/interrogating enemies/civilians  the latter which was part of PR but not currently introduced in Squad, The first Cache intel however is given to you after a few minutes at the start of the round, but the rest of them you have to gain intel for or just find them yourself by searching the map and looking for enemy activity,  after a certain amount of caches have been destroyed blufor wins,  and opfor needs to defend them all and deplete the blufors reinforcement tickets,  however  Insurgents dont have any tickets.\n\nTheres also some new and smaller modes like Conquest and one more at least that I cant remember right now, but they are not as polished or popular currently.\n\nThe maps are all pretty big, detailed and all well made, the locations of them will also vary a lot,  currently we have some maps set in eastern europe and afghanistan but in the future we will also see urban maps like the one thats currently being remade from PR Fallujah West one very popular urban map set in Iraq,  and the current size of them are between 1 square km to 4 km Which PR had about the same sizes,  but I think they have been thinking about making maps even up to 16 square kms in size once the next thing im most excited for with this game gets introduced.\n\nYes VEHICLES!  Vehicles of all sorts will make their introduction in the future, everything from  ground transport humvees/technicals to apcs,tanks and helicopters. And as youd expect you will need to have several crewmen in them to operate them, you will not just be able to solo a tank or APC,  This is not battlefield!\n\nOne of the coolest and most unique features in Squad has to be the FOB building system (FOB is one of the 3 types of spawn points in Squad) while it was in PR it was just very basic then,  now in Squad you can make huge  bases for your FOB's  or make them as tiny as you want, as the basebuilding is very easy to do,  currently the requirements to place down a FOB radio is only to have a couple of teammates by your side and to not be too close too another FOB,  but in the future you will have to establish supply routers with  Logistic Trucks and Helicopters that have to come and deliver supplies before you can build up your FOB,  and you will also need additional supplies to upgrade it even more and  too keep it up and running.\n\nBesides FOB's you can spawn on Squad Leader dropped Rally points, which also require some of your squad mates near to be able to be dropped,  it also only has a certain amount of respawns, and if enemies get too near to a rally point they will disappear.\n\nThe 3RD type of spawnpoint is your Mainbase which will probably get seen more used in the future once things like Helicopters are introduced,  where you will be able to jump in and get your transport back to the battlefield that way.\n\nNow lets talk about roles and kits,  The kit selection system works in the way that once you are a part of a squad and the bigger that squad gets, more kits and roles (classes)  get avaible for  you and your squad to pick from, altough most kits also have certain  limits to them,  like for example you can only have 2 medics in a full 8 man Squad,  same with AR's Same with LAT's  but if we were only example  just 4 people in a squad,  we would only be able to have 1 medic etc. This is just another way to promote playing in a squad and with your squad, and aslo for realism and balance reasons certain kits are limited.\n\nNow I could go and on and keep talking about the features and mechanics of this game,  but nobody wants too read tha many pages right? ;)  So im gonna stop it here, I think I touched on the most important parts of the game.\n\nBut all in all Squad is a very great tactical shooter with a focus on teamwork and communication that will just get better with time, and that I can also see lasting a very long time thanks to the everlasting and growing PR community, and now with us being on steam it's probably only gonna get better :)","December 15, 2015","true","17.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Wow, so I go to my pc and load it up with my surround sound headset, cranked the graphics and join a game. It was almost like they took a image out of my head of a terrain layout. Had my heart pounding already but after the gunfire started my anxiety went off the chart. Arma 3 doesnt have anything on the realism this game puts you in.

It was a great game upon launch and what was & is promised to be added in future development does not detract from the games playablity what so ever. Ive seen more bugs and glitches in final release games backed by major brand name studios. The gameplay is smooth and fluid, the gun play is not clunky, it feels acurate and responsive. No issues with shots registering. Very good graphics for such large maps and so much going on. The most intially complete alpha i've ever purchased and recently they release updates with working machine gun emplacements and overhauled the game to make adding vehicles possible in future releases. I've been told by AMD users the lastest update even allows them to play with less performace issues. Even hot patchs hours after major updates to address issues.  The devs are serious about this game.\n\nProbably the most difficult but rewarding gameplay i've had since actual project reality. I immensily enjoy actual combat. That being said the toughtest part is the entire game revolves around teamwork. If you don't have a mic or dont speak basic english, this game might not be for you. To be on the winning team not only does your squad of up to 9 people have to communicate and work together to cover fire, move and flank, address injured players, build bases and rallys but your squad leader must work with other squad leaders to coordinate attacks and their defense.\n\nThe community seems to fluctuate but lately more and more people seem to talk and play together. I've had a bunch of really close games full of long and intense fire fights. The game is everything you could hope for in a tactical shooter/open battlefield game. Its the players that can make or break the experince. Read some guides before buying if you want to know what to expect and what is expected of you.","February 24","true","303.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The game shows a lot of improvements on most of the competing games. I has a larger map and supports more players than insurgency, it runs when it has a lot of players, unlike ArmA, and looks better graphically than Project Reality.\n\nSquad is a game created so those who want a hardcore military sim can play without a $3000 computer. The amount of teamwork in the public servers matches that of loose clans, you wont find people who understand everything and follow the chain of command to a T, but you will find those willing to work together towards a common goal. I backed this game sight unseen, and was rewarded ten-fold when I played it at PAX and got to talk to the Developers first-hand. I won't say this is a game for everyone however, the difficulty curve is relatively high and if you are not already accustomed to games like Insurgency, ArmA and Red Orchestra, I would say to look into it a bit more and see if you are really ready to be shot a kilometer away from a sniper providing overwatch.\n\nI really enjoyed Project Reality and from what I can tell, this game meets everything I need in a modern tactical shooter.","December 15, 2015","true","13.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

It's a great team-oriented game.  You NEED cooperation and teamwork to win.  It's addictively fun; the FOB-building, exhilirating, realistic combat, and in the works, but soon to be hopefully implemented, transportation.\n\nSince the release of Alpha, the Devs have been working hard to release a better product every patch with exciting new updates and fixes.

Then this game will just be a waste of 40$ for you.  It's pretty much the same thing, but in a currently worse state (Early Access, remember that.)\n\nThere are several issues with the game itself running too as well that the devs are aware of and aren't currently fixable.  Luckily steam refund will have you covered on that if it does happen.\n\nWeapon selection is bare bones, people will trap you in a base somewhere usually, this is a game you almost must play with friends.  For some reason your guy puts his weapon to safe when putting away a weapon which is a joke.  Have these guys ever been in a deployed enviroment?  You never put any of your guns on safe when you're out on patrol or in an active warzone with enemies all around you.   *swap to pistol, puts M4 on safe and puts away, brings out pistol, disengages safe, ready to fire, you're already dead*\n\nTool animations are way to long, IE: throwing grenades, smokes, weapon transitions, reloads.\nUS side are supposed to be trained warriors, yet they aren't.  Just as bad as the middle eastern side.\n\nOther side though, the graphics are great, it feels fluid and as I said above, shows promise in the distant future.\n\n\nI do not recommend this game in it's current state.  I have already refunded it.  Overly hyped.  Arma 2 with all DLC is way cheaper (plus on ♥♥♥) and has a huge modding community.","January 7","false","0.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

Why havent you got the game yet... This game is for you.\n\nAs a few last words, I'd like to point out that this game is the quality of some other games that have been in early access for a good 6 months.

I'd say the mouse resolution quite simlpy is something that can't really support sharshooting mode with rather limited zoom unlike that of Arma, while automatic fire is very out of place at rather close ranges as well.","February 14","false","192.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","1"
