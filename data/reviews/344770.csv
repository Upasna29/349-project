I personally find this feature of theirs is really unique in a sense that it sends a solid message of one strenghts.\nThe Fourth Wall Will Not Protect You. ;)\n\nAudio and Visual elementsVisual elements - CGs are really good with extremely polished backgrounds and the animated scenes (Cinematic Novel) are very fluid really of high quality of work being put in there, breaking free from the static nature of many visual novels out there, and adding depth and motion to a scene to create a more dynamic emotional response. It honestly felt like watching a anime with all the camera movement and selective focus on parts to create motion.\n\nCharacter design - Their clothing are coloured with colours of gems for example (white and purple) and some supporting chracter have royalty colour on them which suits the setting in the Visual Novel.\n\nAudio elements - There is no voice acting, but the music are on a complete different level it perfectly sets the mood and it belongs in the situation of the environment which it was a joy to listen to in fact i found myself just pausing occasionally just to listen to the music which is something i rarely do, while the sound effect perfectly depict all the action that is going on in the background.\n\nTo sum upIf you are looking for a high qulity Visual Novel with indepth discussion of culture with fluid writing that is never dull while talking about real world problems like discrimination of the rich and the poor.\n\nDo not give this Visual Novel a miss.\n\nA note: The game grew outside what the developers originally intended, and it was announced that fault milestone two will be split into two parts, Fault Milestone Two side:above and Fault Milestone Two side: below.\n\nPlease note too that this novel is a direct sequel to fault milestone one and contains massive spoilers of the first story. Play through of the first title is highly advised.\n\nClick here for the full review![azusantiara.com]\nFault Milestone One  Steam Store Page\nOfficial website link - http://projectwritten.com/fault/","September 8, 2015","true","116.8"," 83 of 96 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","83","96","8","10"

Readers who enjoyed Fault Milestone 1 will absolutely adore Milestone 2. In the first five minutes, the story immerses you back into a world of magic and fantasy. New visual aspects aid the readers mood and the sound effects are spot on. Storywise, there should be no surprise to feel absolutely enveloped by it. Readers who have experienced the first part will also notice that certain details get a little kinkier than last time, which is no problem to me. The game does not diverge at all from its original tone and actually gets deeper and deeper into the fantastic fantasy world. The history can be seen to slowly unravel and the quaint little town setting of the first one is changed into a much bigger, broader world, full of new adventures. Best of all, we get to delve into the engrossing expeditions of the adorable (yet brave and breathtaking) heroines, Selphine, Ritona, and Rune! There is no doubt that the Fault series can be enjoyed by both beginners and veterans to visual novels!\n\n\nA+ Recommended.","September 8, 2015","true","12.9"," 49 of 52 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","49","52","0","0"

This kinetic novel story, is the best that i have ever read. The character development, the plot, the art, the music, its all done professionally and beautifully craft. You should buy and read the first one and also buy and read the second one. Now, if you still need more reason, Let me tell you in this long wall of text.\n\nFirst thing first, the character development is.. wow. Its very good, you will know, care, and feel connected with the characters after you done with this kinetic novel. Usually in a lot of anime or visual novel, the way they tell the ruthless character to soften up is to change their personality instanly once they soften up, but this kinetic novel managed to make the ruthless character stay ruthless, but giving her a deep and logical reason of why she is ruthless. There is no one dimensional characters in this kinetic novel. It managed to makes me care with every characters even the evil one, and also makes me curious about others characters that the kinetic novel still didn't tells. Every characters have a reason to do what they do, even though it feels wrong at first, that is the best part of the characters.\n\nThe plot is well done as well, because it depends on the characters and as i said above, the characters development is really good. Although the plot didn't have the "Unique" stuff like the first one have, it is still engaging and also fun while also very touching and might makes you cry. I have to say this however, this one is also leaving a lot of unanswered plot point while didn't really answered the first one. Unlike the first one however, the plot give the main character a better reason of why they do what they do, why they help the people along the way even though their freaking kingdom is in danger !\n\nThe art and the visual as you see on the store page is very nice and beautifully drawn, it what makes me even try this title when it first came out. Like i said on my fault milestone 2 demo review, they have a freaking battle cutscene !! In a kinetic novel !!! All the battle CG feels alive and engagging which is really good, not a lot of visual novel could do that to me, to make my imagination fill in the blank. In my mind, the battle CG plays out like an anime instead of still pictures.\n\nI don't know how to comment about the music, but i know when a background music is good and did their job well, and this novel background music did that both. they help me connect to a scene, like a sad scene or a fight scene. One of my dissapointment however, its the lack of voice acting. A lot of jokes felt flat because of it, because i know i would have laugh out loud if i heard the intonation of the characters when they said this funny stuff.\n\nSoo, yeah ! Recommended to the highest degree. If you enjoy visual novel and reading, be sure to buy this. If you enjoy an epic and touching story, be sure to buy this. Just buy this already ! Steamkravter, buy this ! ^-^","September 12, 2015","true","5.6"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","28","32","0","1"

However in some cases where something exceptional is made i will.  Something that i can either put my time to for extremely long periods, enjoy it to a maximum extent where nothing gives me hesitation or where my very outlook on certain things change entirely. This visual novel bought out both 2 and 3 of these 3 reasons.\n\nThe art/style: The visuals are absolutly stunning, amazing barely covers it. I presonally love it and feel that it adds a lot to the visual novel with the different backgrounds, charater designs, and effects. The intro and credits are the only two "movie" cg throughout the game but are well done for how short they are both explaining the latest events from fault milestone 1 and the aftermath of whats happened in this visual novel. The CG itself is beautiful and again really shows off the skill and talent  at  Alive in Dissonance. This game is visually stunning in every detail\n\nThe story: (No spoilers) The story took me about 4-5 hours to complete. This is fairly short but don't go into it expecting to read little. In the time given the story explodes with absolute moments of intensity, moments of calm (including in the menu screen) moments of disbelief and one moment of genuine anger towards a charcter. It was filled wit a lot of emotions. Also desipte its size this visual novel can be both for casual readers and those are looking for something that truly surfices their reading needs. I will say this as well. The way the story moves forward is smooth. There are no points i felt it was rushed or needed to be sped up. Unlike the fault milestone 1 i felt i could have read this visual novel the whole way through in one sitting with no problems at all (not to say fault milestone 1 was bad because it isn't).\n\nThe characters: There are 3 main characters, multiple sub characters and the main bad group of enemies. The 3 main characters develop an ever bigger sense of self showing their personalities even more so then they already had been. Providing a new outlook on them especially with Rune and Selphine. Sadly with Ritona although we don't see much change in personality or even development in her overall character. We do get a new side of her compared to Fault Milestone 1 that is caused mainly by the events of Fault Milestone 1 as well as an event that occurs within Fault Milestone 2.\n\nThe new characters you meet as well as old characters from Fault Milestone 1 were somehow all unique and none felt they were wasted or pointless at all. One thing that was interesting is the fact that even characters who had little to no input into the story still had actual character models made for them. Hell a few characters you never even found out their name.  I'm espeically interested in what will happen with Flora, Misha and Riggs.\n\nNext the group of "enemies" now due to my no spoiler review this will be harder to explain. We see barely anything about them again in 2 however we do get a little bit of interest from the leader. Learning her power and even her breaking the 4th wall very slightly. It gave a whole insight into what Ritona and Selphine are up against when returning home to Rughzenhide.\n\nReplayability: Although i find it hard to replay most visual novels without having a very large gap inbetween play times. I can very easily see myself replaying this. It left me wanting, no craving for Fault Milestone 2 : below. I really cannot wait to see how the story progresses.\n\nMusic: The soundtrack and effects made are truly incredible. They push forth what the scene is trying to make you feel. Anger, Sadness, Intensity. The general mood in visual novels hinges by a pivot and the music really sets the mood into what the writers clearly wanted the mood to feel like for the reader. The soundtrack is great but doens't have anything in my mind that stood out such as The fruit of grisaia's Home (for Amane) or Holograph (for Sakaki) in Their respective routes.\n\nOverall: I really really enjoyed this visual novel. No ifs or buts about it. It was a massive improvement on what was already a good 1st game. Although we are left with a lot of unanwsered questions I got a brilliant amount of satisfaction from the game. I would highly recommend trying it.\n\nHowever  for the love of god play through the 1st fault milestone. If you do not you may be very confused as to what is going on.\n\nFinal score 10/10 At the least a must try. After reading through this visual novel i'd be happy paying for it at full price despite how short it may seem.","November 4, 2015","true","1.8"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","6"

Relative to ms1, which you absolutely should read first if you haven't, I think it's a much more tightly constructed piece of work. Everything has it's place so to speak and it's all arranged just so in a way that all comes together brilliantly. The art is very solid and I'd suggest it's a moderate step up from ms1 overall. In particular it's event CGs are very plentiful at 52 compared to the 24 found in ms1, this is despite it being only slightly longer. The art and atmosphere are also enhanced by the periodic use of camera work which typically looks quite nice, although a few graphics lack the resolution to cope with it well if your screen is over 1200p. The music is more or less on par with the previous title, although a little different as they picked up a dedicated composer. I found the writing to be a really meaningful step up from the original. This is due in part to a new translator being used who does a much better job than their predecessor. I would also mention the improved translation in turn leads to better world cohesion which is nice to see. On an aside it's worth rereading the encyclopedia, which has many of  the same entries as ms1, as the old translation was outright wrong in some cases.\n\nIn terms of possible negatives I will say with regards to the direction they go in terms of character screen time that it may irritate some people, however I can't go into that without spoilers. Personally I found it interesting although I do suspect I'll enjoy ms2:b, which I eagerly await, more than I did ms2:a.\n\nTo anybody worried about the naming scheme with regards to above/bellow, you shouldn't be. It's episodic in much the same way as ms1 and you still come away with a satisfying self contained story.\n\nOverall I think anybody who even remotely enjoyed ms1 should be very happy with this purchase. To people who haven't read ms1 I'd suggest you go check it out. It's a little rougher around the edges but still an exceptional read.\n\nNote this review will tag as pre-release because patreons started getting keys a few hours before launch, I also paid for a phisical JP copy and would have a key from that anyway so I don't consider it a conflict but I though I'd disclose anyway.","September 8, 2015","true","92.5"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","0"

With a better translator and a clearly more experienced production staff, Alice in Dissonance is a now an indie visual novel company to look out for. The fairly interesting premise and world being developed in milestone one has started to blossom into a truly engaging and exciting story.\n\nI think the biggest strength of this installment is that it provides a dramatic, fast-paced episodic short story while melding it into a larger narrative. There are plenty of exciting moments, and fans who thought milestone one didn't have enough action will be pleasantly surprised. Due to events in-story, most of the focus is on Selphine and Rune, who get their chance to drive the action -- and they definitely succeed. Awesome moments abound.\n\nLike milestone one, milestone 2a isn't afraid to pull at your heartstrings or shine a spotlight on some of the ugly things humans are capable of. There are no miracles in this world, and our protagonists can only do what they can while pressing forwards. Plus, it's clear that events elsewhere in the world proceed apace, and that what we see is merely a tantalizing glimpse of a larger backstory. I can't wait for further installments.\n\nOn a more technical note, the art quality, sound engineering, and use of game/camera mechanics have all improved significantly. There are still parts of the art that look amateurish, and the lack of voice acting is a shame, but that's to be expected in an indie game. There's also some clever breaking of the fourth wall, and the game extensively uses camera movement and selective focus on parts of CGs to create a sense of motion. This is a kinetic novel, and there are no choices.\n\nThe fault series as a whole also departs quite a bit from more conventional visual novel styles. There are very few slice-of-life or comedy scenes, and the few included give you barely enough time to catch your breath between high-tension moments. Rune, Selphine, and Ritona act with a clear sense of urgency, and the story itself accommodates that feeling. If you're used to something like Fate/Stay Night or Key works, you'll find that the narrative rolls by at a breathtaking pace.This is a short VN, and major events happen in quick succession.\n\nReally, though, my only meaningful complaint is that it's just too short. It's obvious that the particular storyline in milestone 2a is just a sideshow to the far more important events that will (presumably) happen in milestone 2b.\n\nI can't wait.\n\n","September 8, 2015","true","3.3"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

I am terrible at reviewing narratives (like VNs), so I'll just put this in perspective.\n\nI've played a bunch of visual novels, ranging from Katawa Shoujo to Muv Luv (which I despised).  Honestly, fault is the only Visual Novel I've ever read that actually managed to be so good I wanted to throw all my money at it.  Pretty much everything else out there doesn't compare to fault.\n\nWhy?  Well, besides being very well written with lovable characters that succeed at breaking away from generic anime stereotypes, it also has something very dear to me that every narrative should have; a detailed, fascinating world.  Of course, it really helps that this world clicks with my interpretations and views of HOW FANTASTY SHOULD BE and such.  I guess this entire review is sort of pointless then, because of everything out there fault is one of the only things that actually managed to click with me.\n\nSo if you've heavy into detailed, intricate fantasy worlds with a spirit of adventure, a healthy dose of sci-fi, and covnersations about society and politics, fault is your cake.\n\nIf a stickler like me can love this, then there is no reason you shouldn't.\n\nPS: Rhegan - Selly combo is the best.

No spoilers here, but it's extremely cliffhangery, much like the first.\nIt should be noted that I read pretty quick, and you're paying $15 for not a lot of content, so even after finishing the game I'm actually still eligible for a refund.

ALICE IN DISSONANCE shows that they're serious in really pushing the bar on what the Visual Novel medium can pull off, though I can't really explain in detail without spoiling some cool stuff that happens in the story.\n\nEverything has been improved over the first; scenes and backgrounds are high quality, the music and ambience never fail to set the appropriate mood for each scene, and their use of their newly implemented "3D camera" really does make the whole experience that much better.\n\nAnd following up on what I mentioned in my review for 'fault milestone one', 'milestone two' takes the foundation that was set before and builds well on top of it, delving deeper into the origins of manakravte and other "intangible" concepts that were introduced prior. Seeing as there's rarely actually a need to explain the mechanics of "magic' and the like in stories of fantasy, the extra lore is a really nice touch, and makes the tale a whole lot juicier.\n\nIf you've read the first, get it.

The same goes for the sequel, which continues the story off with new themes concerning income equality, poverty and the effects of oligarchy on society. These issues are topical in a way, and like its predecessor, the second milestone depressed while tackling those issues. Too bad it doesn't happen until you reach the very end of the novel.\nThe overall production values are even higher here, with a 3D camera system that takes wide and close-up shots to make the visual side of the story more intriguing and stimulating. This comes with the problem that sometimes when zooming in with close-up shots, you can see some pretty apparent pixelation in the characters.\n\nI also had two problems with the story here. One is that it presents some kind of a side story that features characters from seemingly another state in the first hour, which is then completely thrown out and forgotten for the rest of the story. The second problem I have is the pacing. The second half of the game doesn't really do a whole lot to the story progression, never really gathering any tension save for few parts, until the last great moments start kicking in and the story ends. Abruptly. For now it seems that we have to wait for the second part of this story to arrive, which is why it ended in a cliffhanger with a lot of loose threads to solve.\n\nAt the end of the day, I do recommend reading this, especially if you've read the first one. Alice in Dissonance has proved that they have some lovely storytelling and strong audiovisual candy to deliver, but I just wish they wouldn't get off the rails as much when they go into such minute detail with parts of the story.","May 1","true","6.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Though not without the apprehension that it would sadly disappoint.\nI'm glad to report that for the most part, it did not. In fact in a lot of ways it was far more than I could have hoped for.\n\nFirst of all, a warning to those who have read the first part of the Fault series. This one is a little on the short side, but that was due to the developers feeling it was better to split this part in half to better tell the story.\n\nThat by no means makes it less worthwhile though. The production value put into this is far superior to the previous installment. The animation quality has been overhauled to really break the idea of what a 'visual novel' is. No more static images with changing facial expressions, we now have camera angles and fancy intense moments that really make it more like a cinematic movie than simply a digital book.\n\nI really can't trust myself to not spoil the story, so I won't go into that in any detail. It is still written in the same amazing style as the first Fault, the start will blow your mind and the end will really leave you wanting more.\n\nAnd if you haven't read the first, why are you still here?

Not only that but Alice in Dissonance could even be compared to the VN kings Nitro+ and MAGES. in terms of overall quality. Keep up the fantastic work Alice. From the opening minutes to the closing credits this VN is an incredibly well written, well directed, and well paced journey all the way through.\n\nPicking up at the exact moment the original left off you're greeted with surprise after surprise on the journey along with mystery, suspense, lots of feels, and wonderful wonderful character development. Even the end credits are wonderfully done and will leave a lasting impression. The rise in production quality from the first is immediately apparent even in the first few lines of the VN, and that is saying something considering the level of polish the first one had. Although this installment also follows the same anime-ey/manga-ey (it was supposed to be a manga originally) "come to a new place, meet new people, move on" story arc style (similar to One Piece for a popular example) the characters and pacing are leagues ahead of anything similar I've seen especially considering this is from an indie studio.\n\nAlso much like the first the overall plot regarding the journey home gets touched mostly at the start, and any scenes regarding the overarching story after are sprinkled throughout allowing the urgency of the situation to still be clear even as the VN is in the middle of the story arc for the new location. Those who have played the first will also be pleased to know that the great art from the first has somehow improved along with a lot more backgrounds and transitional effects that really make this VN stand out from many others I've played. The OST for this game is also one of the best I've heard in a VN, and thankfully the opening movie is slower than the first which moved so fast it was fairly difficult to read it all.\n\nThe only cons I can think of are:\n-This game is too great not to get Voice Acting, but the lack of any voice actors allow for the higher quality of everything else. I can only hope that they will one day be able to patch some Voices in.\n-Some of the art for the one-off characters is of noticeably lower quality than of everything else. While this isn't exactly a problem the level of polish this VN has definitely makes the disparity in quality stand out more.\n\nOverall:\n9.5/10\nI can only hope the rest of the series continues to be as great as this release was.","September 16, 2015","true","7.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

More cute anime girls involved in crazy violence!\n\nFault 2 is a direct sequel to Fault 1, so you shouldn't even touch this game until you have played the first one. While there is a recap video... no. Just play the first one entirely before getting into this. It's worth it.\n\nSo is this, actually. Whereas Fault 1 introduced you to Selphine and Ritona before becoming the Rune show, Fault 2's storyline has other characters playing notable roles while still being chiefly about the thee main characters. Selphine in particular has alot to do in this part of the story, and you get to see a side of her that is the polar opposite of the huggly princess we met in Fault 1. Different to such a degree that it might frighten the player just as much as the other characters to see how much she changes. Naturally all of this is explained in the story itself, but I am not going to dig into that here because spoilers.\n\nThe story itself is still short, but if anything the quality has only increased this time. This is helped by the quality soundtrack, a far larger number of pretty CG images, and a few moments of good animation you don't usually see in VN's. Still no voice acting sadly, but that's just something you have to live with. Also, just as in the first game, Fault 2 makes some commentary on things in our world that should change. Specifically, this game digs into class divides, racism, organized crime, and even takes time to give us an internet metaphor to say that internet trolls are boring people who need to find better hobbies. XD\n\nThe game isn't perfect though. The ending is even more abrupt this time and leaves several plots dangling until the next chapter picks them up again. You go back to Rughzenhaide to meet some new characters and then... poof! Not that I minded too much because I was way more interested in what psycho Selphine was doing, but still I wonder where exactly that subplot was going. The major stuff with Ritona is left unresolved, which is kind of one of the major plot elements of the game's second half. When the game suddenly ended without this being resolved, I felt a bit cheated. Lastly, we still don't know what the hell is driving Melano, Sian, Koko, and Mharie towards all the violence we saw them perform in the opening of the first game. They want to kill Selphine? Ok we got that... but why? I know this is pretty much the core of the plot, but some progress here would have been nice. Overall I felt like this game ended too suddenly and is worse off because of it.\n\nThis is a really good VN and a worthy sequel that just... ended way too suddenly. Even moreso than Fault 1 did. I was thoroughly enjoying this until the credits started rolling. Considering it was nearly a year since the first game came out, I'd expect a similar wait for Fault 3 is to be expected. Taking that into consideration, ALICE IN DISSONANCE really dropped the ball by having my last impression of this game not be how awesome it was for it's duration, but that it had a ♥♥♥♥ ending.\n\nI really hate when a game I really like has such a glaring flaw that I almost want to give it a negative review. But... I still enjoyed the game and am looking forward to seeing what happens next. A game I would throw under the bus would leave me apathetic rather than intrigued, so... this gets a "yes" from me despite the fact that I am giving ALICE IN DISSONANCE the kind of scary death glares that Selphine was giving throughout this game. Please don't ever do that again, or I just might be forced to rage at Fault 3 when that eventually comes out.\n\nBeware! For I have a scary side too! O_O\n\nEDIT: Apparently this is just the first half of Fault 2, with the second half coming later. I still think the ending was abrupt and that splitting the game was probably a bad idea... but I may have to edit this review once the second half shows up... whenever that may be.","September 9, 2015","true","13.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

And per its pedigree, rather than dwelling too much on the details of such magic itself, the story uses them to explore what people would do with such tools at their disposal, and the effects on both personal relationships and society in general, making a few not-so-subtle parallels to things people do in the present-day.\n\nThe presentation continues to be well done, including the music which was appropriate and enjoyable, and the artwork which felt quite improved over the first installment. The backgrounds for different locales seemed more diverse this time around as well. And though the basic themes of the story are ones that have been retold many times before in other places, a solid execution of the storytelling counts for much in my estimation, without necessarily having to create anything unique or complex (after all, what story *hasn't* been told over the last few thousand years of human history anyhow?), and fault delivers in this respect.\n\nI found side:above's story to be less elaborate than milestone one's, which started playing out a number of different threads, giving hints of how they are weaved together here and there, and then finally completing and showing off the pattern at the end when all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place in an emotional crescendo. The sequel is a bit of a different style, more straightforward, with less mystery but more emotion sprinkled throughout, though certain threads are left hanging at the very end. This chapter is half a chapter it seems (with side:below to be forthcoming), and is thus unfortunately even shorter than the first episode.\n\nSo as with my review of milestone one, I continue to wait with anticipation for the next installment...","September 23, 2015","true","4.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The characters see more development and are put into a situation where they see a different frame of view. This felt better paced to the first one and you get more of the journey with party, there are no choices but that’s to be expected. It’s a story being told.\n\nIt’s not all that common for a game to leave me with a lasting feeling for it. A lasting impression almost like being heartbroken due to the impression it left and the feelings it left me with. Fault milestone one didn’t do this to me as much although it was a great game, just a little prolonged for my tastes but I love the story. There are no options in this, it’s a story so expect reading.\n\nIF YOU HAVEN’T PLAYED ONE THEN PROBABLY SHOULDN’T READ PAST HERE BECAUSE SPOILERS.\n\nSo two starts where one left off being confronted by one of the badies from the start of the first game and from that point the story continues. The story of two follows the journey of Ritona, Rune and Selphine as they continue their travels. In terms of the story, it’s great and I love it. The characters get some more development and are places outside of everything they are used to and put them into a different frame of mind. Rune, from the world of science (and steampunk?) gets to see the magic world. Unfortunately we don’t get to see a lot of Ritona this chapter and I would really like to know her story but no matter. Most of the interaction in this story is between Rune, Selphine (while in Empress Syndrome you see at the end of the first game) and characters they met in their journey.\n\nAs far as the art and story goes it’s great, the sound fits the game although I turned it down a fair bit otherwise it’s just too loud for me. The art is amazing as it was and I really like the CG events in this game a lot.\n\nPersonal feelings on this are I just love the story, the pacing was better than it was in the last game and the story was something that if I had the time I could just sit down and play through in one sitting. This really left a heavy feeling in my heart and left a lasting impression emotionally. I love the concepts shown in this world and also the stark difference between the inner and outer poles. I can’t wait for the third game.\n","March 12","true","17.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

There is supposed to be a second part, hence why the ending is rather abrupt.\n\nART/MUSIC Keeping in line with Fault 1, the art and music are both beautifully done. With the integration of the new 3d camera system, it really does feel much more immersive. It’s a terrific addition that makes this novel feel much more engaging.\n\nSTORY As I’ve mentioned in my Fault 1 review, this story is very focused on the use of mana, as well as social and political injustice.\nWhile Fault 1 revolves around educating the reader on the lore, Fault 2 is able to focus on creating an emotional plot. Through the well written story, you cycle through the calm, relaxing, sweet moments to the intense, action filled, downright eerie bits. Through this emotional rollercoaster, you gain a better understanding of the characters and you are able to relate to them on a much deeper level. Halfway through, I found that I grew very attached to them.\n\n\nCONCLUSION Fault 2 is an enthralling visual novel that successfully pulls you into an intricate science-fantasy world.\nIf you’re a fan of the genre and don’t mind the lack of fan service, I fully recommend the Fault series.","April 25","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This was a problem with the first one, but I overlooked it because the second one was already availiable. For a serial story, I think it would be more functional if each episode were more standalone.\n-The Encyclopedia isn't as complete as it should be. A number of terms in the story that are mentioned and defined do not appear. It would really lend to the "Science" part of Science Fantasy if these things were more accessible. You've certainly put time into the mechanics of your setting, and we'd like to see them.\n--On that note, I'd like to know more about the relative manakravting power of characters to others. Is a Trikravter superior to a Dualkravter? While your setting explains itself well, it doesn't address some of the major questions I have about the setting. It defines a lot of marginalia, but is hesitant about defining the overall world. Fault Milestone One worked because we could contrast the Outer Pole with Rughzenhaide, but Viscanta and New Sasary do very little to inform us about the overall world. Because of that, this second milestone feels more like an extended prologue, rather than the first chapter of an engaging novel. It's a very effective prologue, but I care about Ritona, Selphine, and Rune (I was on the fence about her, but you swung me over nicely) way more than Sol and Mil.\n-While it's great that you're calling attention to social inequality (expecially gender inequality) it feels a littttle disingenous to have a semi-nude scene with a woman. It happened  to be one of my favorite characters, and it kinda made me feel voyeuristic in a way that violated them. Fan service is great, but if you want to gain the credibility amongst the political circles you're addressing, let the fans make their own fan service. If your series is good enough (which it is) they will do it for you.\n\nOther than that, Fault continues to deliver. The production values are even higher and the score is great. The plot develops nicely on the first one and is definetly worth the money. If you liked the first one, the second might hook you for the rest of their upcoming series.","January 20","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I feels so sad yet happy that I'm done. I am both satisfied and desatisfied as I really enjoyed fm2:above but, at the same time, I'm having a crisis since fb2:silence the pedant and fm2:below have not been released yet.\n\nI assume the reason they split it up (besides the whole $15 issue) is because, even though fm2:a is a self contained story, part of it, which I can't really go into without spoilers, is overarching. Basically, the main focus of this cinimatic/visual novel is resolved, but a different, over-arching plot is not. That's what I reckon Alice in Dissonance meant on their Patreon update when they stated that it wouldn't really make sense to just make fm2 and fm3.\n\nOn that note, I highly recommend that those who enjoyed the game go support their Patreon.

The CG and character art is at least as good as the first but there is now roughly twice as many CG images as Milestone One despite this installment being slightly shorter than the first (more on that further down).\n\nBut, even more than that, the clever '3D Camera' system that has been added extracts so much more from each image by the clever way it pans and zooms around the images during dialogue and action-y sequences (rather a lot of those this time!). Coupled with the typical changes in expression of the characters and other subtle changes it created a great sense of movement and pace without actual animation. You'll understand what I mean when you see it in action!\n\nThe story and dialogue itself as excellent and they have definitely addressed one of the key criticisms of Milestone One with it's unnecesery.. wordiness in a small number of scenes. Things feel a lot more punchy and to the point this time; the plot itself is generally a lot more fast paced in this installment so it suits it well.\n\nThis time Selphine and Rune take center stage and Ritona sits out much of the story for plot reasons. I feel there's some great development in Rune's character as she becomes more sure of herself culminating in one seriously epic scene that I won't spoil here. :) And you'll certainly see a very different, ah, "side" of Selphine throughout the story too...\n\nHowever, Rhegan has to be my favourite character of this part. It's easy to dismiss her as just a *censored* when she first appears, but I guarentee she will grow on you as you come to understand her throughout the story; I came to respect her a great deal if not necessrily 'like' her. Her ruthlessness is certainly no facade but she has damned good reasons for being as such; that and her sharp cunning serves the girls well.\n\n\nAs negatives.. well the character art of the side characters is of markedly lower quality than that of the main characters. Understandable, sure, but when the quality of everything else is so excellent in contrast you can't help but notice.\n\nAlso this is only the first half of Milestone Two due to a decision to split it into two releases. As such there are rather a number of plot threads that are raised but left unresolved. Though the central plot 'side:above' centers around is concluded and it doesn't exactly end on a cliffhanger like Milestone One did it's a little frustrating knowing I'll be waiting rather a while to see certain events resolved.\n\n\nAlice in Dissonance is onto something very, *very*, special with the fault series and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves so they can keep it going for a long time to come!","October 5, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a pros and cons list for a condensed review below.\n\nWithout spoiling too much, the story in milestone 2 focuses mainly on some important humane issues/morals  like discrimination, greed, and poverty. The story gives us more insight into Selphine as a character as well as fleshing out Rune's personality and her interactions with Selphine. Also, new characters are introduced that give more backstory for Ritona and Selphine.\n\nThe story has great background music that perfectly matches with different scenes ranging from jarring violin screeches to warming piano notes. The art is as beautiful as ever just like the first game and the icing on the cake is the flashy and dynamic movements of the character portraits across the screen which adds great immersion as a reader.\n\nAnother great read and I highly recommend this visual novel!\n\nPros:\n+ Artwork is beautiful\n+ Sound that immerses the reader\n+ Dynamic character movements effectively bring the scenes to life\n+ Increased character development for Rune and Selphine\n+ Real-life issues are addressed like greed, poverty, and discrimination\n\nCons:\n- No voice acting (for me it adds more depth to the characters)\n- Short! (but this sort of depends on your reading speed)\n- Later into the story it doesn't mention the new characters brought up earlier in the game\n- Cliffhanger... again ):\n","September 12, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I feels so sad yet happy that I'm done. I am both satisfied and desatisfied as I really enjoyed fm2:above but, at the same time, I'm having a crisis since fb2:silence the pedant and fm2:below have not been released yet.\n\nI assume the reason they split it up (besides the whole $15 issue) is because, even though fm2:a is a self contained story, part of it, which I can't really go into without spoilers, is overarching. Basically, the main focus of this cinimatic/visual novel is resolved, but a different, over-arching plot is not. That's what I reckon Alice in Dissonance meant on their Patreon update when they stated that it wouldn't really make sense to just make fm2 and fm3.\n\nOn that note, I highly recommend that those who enjoyed the game go support their Patreon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/344770/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Fault Milestone two: above picks up right where the last game ended and introduces us to new areas other than the original's Outer Pole. If you haven't played the first game you will very likely be lost straight away and even if this game features an encyclopedia detailing the world it's set in, I would still highly suggest you play the original first, mediocre as it may be. Going into this second entry of the series I honestly had my expectations set rather low since it's no secret I wasn't a fan of the original due to the massive amount of time you spend in flashbacks and being force fed the lore. Luckily now that the characters are introduced and the unique world that houses both science and magic has been explained we now have a much better flowing & coherent story. While in the original it felt like you had done very little other than get new clothes and friends, in this sequel you will go through a surprising amount of situations in this very beautiful aquatic city.\n\nOnce again it is more than meets the eye as it may appear like a simple light hearted adventure with three very young looking anime characters it actually touches upon social inequality, corruptions and other subjects you would not expect by just glancing at the game. This sequel does a very good job at hooking you in immediately and features a rather neat trick in the beginning that inadvertently caused me to face-palm when I thought the game crashed. The main villain that looks like someone just got out of a Halloween themed party, shows off her power and the threat she poses is made clear to us so she no longer seems like a joke of a character. Not much else will be shown about the villains as this sequel takes place very far away from Princess Selphine's now conquered castle. The story mostly focuses on Selphine, Rune and Ritona as they gather supplies for their journey back to the castle but things end up going really wrong for them.\n\nThey become pretty much stranded in this new land and Selphine really shines. She was your typical happy go lucky cliché type of character but under this new found stress she beats up old people, holds cops hostage and does not take no for an answer. It is no doubt funny seeing such a little girl doing all these things though she will surely hold your attention whenever she is on screen and always has a reason for her rather extreme actions. Back in our protagonist's homeland we will also briefly play as three new characters on a journey to search for the princess. Not much time will be spent with these fellows but from what little we did they seem like decent characters and I am interested in where their journey leads them. This time around there are no choices to be made and you will just be right clicking for the duration of the time. The original had a single “decision” which was completely meaningless so this feature won't be missed though it is something you should be aware of.\n\nUnfortunately one thing that did carry over from the original game is the glitch in where the text cuts off at the bottom if there are multiple lines in the speech box. It's annoying as ever and pretty disappointing that it has not been fixed in their new game. Aside from the main story you will have an audio box to listen to the sound track and a gallery to see the artwork used in this game from the main menu. The artwork for this game is simply amazing and features far more awe inspiring locations. Everything is much improved over its predecessor and it is very much worth its asking price. Which is where the problem comes in, you pretty much need to play the original to understand this sequel and fault milestone one was indeed interesting but very lacking as well as the same price as this. Fans of the original or even those that weren't too keen on it should definitely give this a shot since it does feature a demo while those new to the series should wait for a sale on the original instead of diving straight into this. Fault milestone two: above is an extremely interesting entry to the series and if the quality of the future entries retain this potential then it's well on its way to becoming one of the best Visual Novels ever made.","March 14","true","8.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

They run into some difficulties, and end up with this full part revolving around their time Port/Neo Sasary. While the start and end felt quite well paced, it did feel like a massive drag in every other part.\n\nThe game does have some minor issues. Namely, some lines near the start will randomly repeat, often with a different "speaker" for them. There are also spelling errors every now and then, and on at least one occasion the entirely wrong speaker is said for a line (that wasn't a repeat). Despite that, fault milestone two side:above has a fantastic story - although I felt it had some lacking pacing issues at times - along with amazing graphics and music.\n\nI do highly suggest reading/playing fault milestone one beforehand though, although it is possible to get through two side:above without having done so. After all, that's what I ended up doing. There'll be some bits you still end up confused on, even with the "previously on fault" and encyclopedia available, but the story is still gripping enough.","October 9, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The world suddenly seems like a much larger place as Ritona and the gang set out on their journey back to their homeland. We are given a chance to see our characters grow even further here, and the actual way they are written has been improved as well (although this can probably be attributed to there being a new translator for this one, if I am to believe what I've been hearing). The plot progresses quite nicely, and leaves you wanting the next part of the story to come right away, which arguably, might be the weakest point in the game. The knowledge that you will have to wait for the next portion of the story is truly the hardest part about this franchise.\n\nThe aesthetic has improved quite a bit as well, as the new camera system does bring a lot to the table in terms of cinematic feeling. The audio is well suited for every situation, and we do see the return of the some of the tracks from Milestone One, which is definitely a plus as the soundtrack overall is rather well rounded. Last touch on aesthetic, but the actual art is also spot on, just as it was in the first game.\n\nTo conclude this short pseudo-review, if you enjoyed the first game, you will enjoy the second one. However, I highly recommend playing the first one before touching this as Milestone Two does contain major spoilers for Milestone One. You have been warned.\n","September 9, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The only fault (heh) I found with it is that it's extremely short - it took me 4 hours 15 minutes all up (Steam doesn't track offline hours so my account playtime is wrong) - and the story's ending feels rather abrupt, moreso than the first game. Even with it's short length, I'd say it's worth the slightly heftly price point thanks to its premium, high-budget visual style, but the ending might leave you a little unfulfilled, as it did me. Still a very solid title, and one of the best visual novels available on Steam.","September 9, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(i mean that in a good way)\nat the begining of the game it felt so normal but during the events and as everything beging to unfold its like.... so immersive and the emotions and philosophy and facts this game truly made me cry at the end! I really want Ritona to be safe! God dammit my feels man this is why i love games like this it seriously does represent what we truly face in reality  and it makes me feel bad because there would be countries... cities or even towns in very similar situations such as this and with people like this everyday...\n\nThis game has seriously brought out... Truth, Facts and so much charisma!\nI really loved the new 3D camera animations and the graphics/design aswell as music/sound effects including the menu navigations have greatly improved!!\nWe MUST support this series, not just for this majestic story but for everything in it!\nThis game is worth the money... This feels 10000 times better reading a plain novel with walls of text on a sheet of paper.. seeing the characters and how they would interact and looking at their motives and emotions aswell as the soundtrack really gets you so immersed into the story!\n\nAlso by the way, just a note for users on Steam..\nif you are running Windows 10 i recommend pressing the letter V on your keyboard (whilst the game is open).\nThis will activate a voice narrator for you and it will narrate all the dialogue from the game! (how cool is that? :P) The only annoying part is that the names of each character will be voiced out but you can block it out as you read the text whilst listening. The narrator voice made the game play experiance feel alot better.. well for me at least :) i didnt mind it\n\nThese guys have really outdone themselves.. bravo you deserve praise applause and this game is truly remarkle~\nEverything about Fault is truly amazing~\n\n\nThanks for reading my review :)\n- DeadSilent","September 9, 2015","true","12.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/344770/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","My review of Fault Milestone One wasn’t particularly positive, and neither will this be. But having said that, Milestone Two is better than I dared hope. It takes big steps forward in quality from the first one, and though I still can’t recommend it, it shows the creators learning and improving rapidly.\n\nMy problems with Fault Milestone Two start with the opening. It doesn’t smoothly draw you into the story of the lives of the characters, instead it slams you right into an action scene without knowing what’s going on. There’s just too much information too fast, without giving you time to latch on to something human to care about. They kind of wrote themselves into this corner by ending Fault Milestone One with the start of this scene. The sequence is creative and impressive in its production quality. But I wish they’d rolled back the story, to give us some time to get reacquainted with the cast, and to know where they’re going. All it needed was a couple minutes of calm before the storm. Because as it is now, when the opening scene ends, the air goes out of the story. It takes a good while before it builds up momentum and feel like it’s going somewhere.\n\nThe marketing describes Fault Milestone Two as a “cinematic” visual novel, and it lives up to that moniker, both in good ways and bad. The positive is that the developers went to town with production values. Part one already looked good, but this takes it to another level, using multiple angles and simple animations during key scenes. The audio is also way above average for a visual novel, with both music and ambient sound doing a lot to heighten the sense of presence and mood.\n\nI’m not sure if it was an intentional stylistic choice in order to make it feel more “cinematic”, but the writing feels distant from the characters. You rarely get any insight into what the viewpoint character is thinking or feeling inside. For much of the episode the primary viewpoint character is Ritona, the personal guard of a princess, who are on the run after enemies conquered their country. The viewpoint is so distant I often forgot that she, and not the camera, was the viewpoint. This harms some scenes quite bad.\n\nFor example, at one point the cast arrives at the port of a new city and are approached by a boy claiming to be a tour guide. His appearance doesn’t suggest he is anything other than what he claims to be. Ritona is suspicious of the boy, but because the scene is told entirely though dialog, she comes across as hysterically irrational. I wish Fault would make more use of the fact that it’s told through text. The dialog writing and portraits aren’t good enough to make up for it. Something made her suspicious, but without getting even a little hint of what it was, she just acts rude for no apparent reason. Movies have a hell of a time trying to convey people’s inner thoughts visually, while novels can easily move inside a character’s head and show us what’s going on in there. Fault Milestone Two does that a few times, so it isn’t averse to doing it. I wish it’d do it more often so I wouldn’t sit there trying to figure out whether a character is a racist, hates children, or if I’m an idiot who missed something.\n\nAnother problem I had is that it suffers from “RPG side quest syndrome”. I.e., it feels like the characters should be doing more important things than what they’re doing. There are multiple story threads, and they aren’t balanced as well as they could. One of them is underlined clearly as “the main story”, “urgent”, and “seriously, this is important” for the characters. And instead of relentlessly pursuing that threat, they go off and do something else. I wish they’d deemphasize the story threads that won’t be resolved within the episode you’re in, and just keep them simmering in the background for later.\n\nIt’s well worth playing this in fullscreen, as the default window doesn’t convey how high rez the artwork actually is. The passion that went into it is clearly visible. Almost every minor character gets their own sprite, and there’s tons of backgrounds and alternative angles to break up the traditional visual novel aesthetic. It’s a big story, with many moving parts, some marching forward to some goal we’ll only see in future installments. I’m interested in seeing what happens next, but I’m a bit worried about where it will end up. There’s so much going on already, that I hope future installments calm down a bit and don’t introduce anything new, for at least one episode. As it is now, the pace is glacial.\n\nFault Milestone Two is close to ok, but not quite there. I noticed myself skimming past the many lore exposition scenes, and some of the dialog is diabolically bad. Parts of the story hit like they should, and I certainly enjoyed the lavish production values. But it still feels like it’s written by amateurs, who don't inspire enough confidence that they know what they're doing. But at the rate they're improving, they might get it right next time, or the time after that. We'll see.","September 25, 2015","false","3.6"," 21 of 48 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","21","48","0","0"

Nevertheless.\n\nPros:\n+ Art. It's very good. Backgrounds especially. Also, dynamic scenes with parallax effects isn't something one would expect from a VN.\n+ Music. I'm seriously contemplating buying OST.\n+ Story. While I sort of liked first one better due to theme, I think this one is as good, if not better. Pacing is quite good. Theme is interesting. A couple tearjerkers here and there. Main plotline ending, while bittersweet, is satisfying.\n+ Characters. Characters are interesting. Can't really say much more due to possible spoilers.\n+ World. I really enjoyed world-building tidbits in first installment. While it's toned down a bit in this one, it's integrated better into narrative, which makes it more enjoyable IMO.\n\nCons:\n- Zero choice. Not a huge deal for me, but bear in mind that you're just along for the ride.\n- No steam achievements. I don't care much personally, but it might be a minus for some. Achievements were added.\n- It's literally half of the story, and it somewhat shows. Two out of three cardinal plot lines are left entirely unresolved, which makes waiting for the next part that much harder T_T\n\nAll in all, definitely a thumbs up from me. Even more so when (if) second part is available.","February 26","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And what a hell of an intro this one has. Picking up where fault milestone one left off, this jumps straight back into the fray with an intro that might leave some of you thinking your computer broke. Do not worry, it didn't. That was just the visual novel being awesome.\n\nThis part of fault gives us another tidbit of the story going on behind the current story, reminding us that these people are trying to get back home despite the obvious danger upon arriving. The main story in this part of fault removes Selphine and Ritona for large chunks of time allowing us a little room to breathe and take in what else is happening. Rune to comes into her own a little and Rhegan tags into the fight, allowing us to see what Selphine could be capable of despite her frail appearance. The main cast once again find themselves in an unfamiliar territory where they must once again fix the problems that everyone else seems to have with being reasonable and their war on sensibility. Joking aside this situation seems familiar, doesn't it? No matter, the story is still just as brilliant as last time. This time we see three more characters that the story will be following as they set out to find Selphine and Ritona. They are in this part for a very short time but no doubt we will see them a lot more in the next part.\n\nThe characters are fleshed out even more this time around, showing us what Selphine could be capable of, that Ritona is not an impassable guardian and that Rune, despite being girly personality-wise, is still one hell of a machine that can kick your ♥♥♥♥ from one end of Rughzenhaide to the other.\n\nMusic and artwork-wise, it is just as good as last time. Nothing to add.\n\nIn conclusion, if you liked fault milestone one, there is no reason whatsoever you wouldn't like fault milestone two side:above and you will be left waiting, once again, for the next part but this time, you will have a hole in your heart. This story is much more touching than the last.","March 12","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story flows and the characters are just as engaging as they were in the first one. The graphics are some of the most beautiful I have ever seen in a game and the soundrack is equally amazing. My computer is a little old so some of the CG scenes lagged for me but I am sure that on a better computer they will run just fine. It is really important that you play the first Fault Milestone before you play this one because the story won't make as much sense to you if you just start with this one(the first game is a little slow and expostion heavy but develops a really compelling world and characters over time with a story that will grip you and leave you wanting more by the end of it.). The real plus to this game though is the character development; they are not just the awesome protagonists that we grew to love in the first game but they start to grow in such a way that will make you root for them even more than you had before (Selphine and Rune's relationship in particular is a highlight).\n\nAs for the negavtives there are a couple. The first being a few side characters that had a little more screen time than I personally cared for. In my review of the demo I mentioned Flora, Misha and Riggs and how their story kind of bored me a few times but I gave it a pass assuming their arc would develop into something really interesting but by the time I finished the game I was a little dissapointed. Their story did not really go anywhere and felt like wasted time. I know there is a sequel already in the works and that they will probably somehow play into the main plotline but honestly their side story felt like kind of a drag to get through (especially since I had to watch it twice because for some reason I wasn't allowed to skip past the parts I had seen in the demo).\n\nThe other major gripe I had is connected with my previous point in that the story in this one kind of felt like filler for things to come. I do not want to spoil anything but the first couple hours of the game was wonderful in how it set everything up and immediately pulled you in. The game unfortunately does not really capitalize on that too much and there are a lot of loose ends left by the time the game ends. I was legitmately surprised when the game ended and not because it had a great cliffhanger (it doesn't) but because it felt a little incomplete (I actually said out loud "Wait...that's it?").  For a little background; Fault Milestone 2 has been split into two games "Fault Milestone Two: Above" and "Fault Milestone Two: Below" and it definetely shows. I'm sure there is a perfectly good reason for splitting the game but after finishing Above it feels very much like an incomplete game which is a little dissappointing.\n\nDespite my gripes this game is still worth your time; especially if you enjoyed the first game. It, for the most part imporves on the first one and despite my personal problems with the story "Fault Milestone Two: Above" has a great story that will make you impatient to discover how everything pans out for Selphine, Ritona and Rune.","September 13, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The translation sees a marginal improvement as it seems Sekai Project's staff has learned from the milestone one. The VN itself includes more action sequences, and well executed ones at that. The pacing suffers a bit at some points, but it's to be expected from the genre. Overall, milestone two manages to further develop the world of fault while revealing moving stories that converge with arching plotlines.\n\nIt's a definite must play for any VN player on Steam.

Nevertheless.\n\nPros:\n+ Art. It's very good. Backgrounds especially. Also, dynamic scenes with parallax effects isn't something one would expect from a VN.\n+ Music. I'm seriously contemplating buying OST.\n+ Story. While I sort of liked first one better due to theme, I think this one is as good, if not better. Pacing is quite good. Theme is interesting. A couple tearjerkers here and there. Main plotline ending, while bittersweet, is satisfying.\n+ Characters. Characters are interesting. Can't really say much more due to possible spoilers.\n+ World. I really enjoyed world-building tidbits in first installment. While it's toned down a bit in this one, it's integrated better into narrative, which makes it more enjoyable IMO.\n\nCons:\n- Zero choice. Not a huge deal for me, but bear in mind that you're just along for the ride.\n- No steam achievements. I don't care much personally, but it might be a minus for some. Achievements were added.\n- It's literally half of the story, and it somewhat shows. Two out of three cardinal plot lines are left entirely unresolved, which makes waiting for the next part that much harder T_T\n\nAll in all, definitely a thumbs up from me.

The art is amazing, if not prettier than before. Introduced in this installment is the 3D camera system which makes some cool dynamic scenes and a greater emphasis on expressions. A section of the first chapter shortly after the introductory cinematic gives a good idea of visuals to come. BAM! WOW!\n\nThe soundtrack captures the emotion of the scenes perfectly. The story has improved pacing to fault one. It's also short (about 4-5 hours) and manages to greatly develop the characters, the world and intrigue. Characters are likeable with not so obvious motivations.\n\nIt is a rollercoaster of adventure and so many emotions! I was disappointed when it ended, I want to know what happens next!

And what a hell of an intro this one has. Picking up where fault milestone one left off, this jumps straight back into the fray with an intro that might leave some of you thinking your computer broke. Do not worry, it didn't. That was just the visual novel being awesome.\n\nThis part of fault gives us another tidbit of the story going on behind the current story, reminding us that these people are trying to get back home despite the obvious danger upon arriving. The main story in this part of fault removes Selphine and Ritona for large chunks of time allowing us a little room to breathe and take in what else is happening. Rune to comes into her own a little and Rhegan tags into the fight, allowing us to see what Selphine could be capable of despite her frail appearance. The main cast once again find themselves in an unfamiliar territory where they must once again fix the problems that everyone else seems to have with being reasonable and their war on sensibility. Joking aside this situation seems familiar, doesn't it? No matter, the story is still just as brilliant as last time. This time we see three more characters that the story will be following as they set out to find Selphine and Ritona. They are in this part for a very short time but no doubt we will see them a lot more in the next part.\n\nThe characters are fleshed out even more this time around, showing us what Selphine could be capable of, that Ritona is not an impassable guardian and that Rune, despite being girly personality-wise, is still one hell of a machine that can kick your ♥♥♥♥ from one end of Rughzenhaide to the other.\n\nMusic and artwork-wise, it is just as good as last time. Nothing to add.\n\nIn conclusion, if you liked fault milestone one, there is no reason whatsoever you wouldn't like fault milestone two side:above and you will be left waiting, once again, for the next part but this time, you will have a hole in your heart. This story is much more touching than the last.","March 12","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We learn more about our three main characters and we especially learn more about the princess. Not only that, but I love how in depth the concept of mana is. This game really gets into the theory behind mana and stays CONSISTENT which is really important when you are trying to craft a fantasty story without making leaps of logic. Even better are the philosophical questions this story raises towards the end. Just like the first game I was BLOWN AWAY by how engrossing it got the closer to the end. I thoroughly enjoyed going through this, but the one thing that annoyed me was how short it is. I think this is shorter than the first game. Although I think there's supposed to be a second part to this game which isn't released yet. Still, I would have liked it to be a little longer.","December 2, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The translation sees a marginal improvement as it seems Sekai Project's staff has learned from the milestone one. The VN itself includes more action sequences, and well executed ones at that. The pacing suffers a bit at some points, but it's to be expected from the genre. Overall, milestone two manages to further develop the world of fault while revealing moving stories that converge with arching plotlines.\n\nIt's a definite must play for any VN player on Steam. The prequel I would suggest reading to establish the world, but it is certainly not a requirement to get enjoyment out of this one.\n\nAlso, the side ponytail is just as good as advertised.","February 1","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you haven't read/played fault milestone one yet, and you have bought and enjoyed visual novels in the past, I'd highly recommend this one.  I've seen enough VNs to know that this is a tier above the rest.  I can't promise a perfect interface, but the story imho is much more than worth it, though I don't think the interface has any overt flaws right now anyway.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have no idea what a visual novel is, then think of it like a cross between a book and a video.  Clicking through the pages to see it at your own pace.  This is very much not a game in the traditional sense, but if you enjoy a good story, I'd highly suggest buying or trying the demo for fault milestone one.  If you like it, you'll probably be back here buying this soon.","February 7","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/icefiremagi/recommended/344770/","icefiremagi","Asadekai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/icefiremagi/","77 products in account","Compared to fault milestone one, fault milestone 2 had much more of an "open world feel". Even if the characters are locked down to one area again, it's still interesting to watch as they engage in another brother-sister relationship, this time, in the making. There's also a lot more lore to be had. If Project Written would allow it, I'd want to stick my own character in there somewhere. fault has fandom-like qualities. A vast, open world for people to explore, a compelling main story that adds a lot of detail, and lore that really intrigues the reader to join in and live through. Enough about that though  you read for a review on THIS story, right? Compared to the first installment of fault, this one really improved on mechanics, even to the point of (spoilers for the first 5 minutes or so) crashing your game on purpose only to re-open to a really scary moment, only to laugh at it after clicking the "undo" button. The main characters (not including the actual main characters) had, in comparison, less story to tell than Rudo and Rune from fault milestone one,  but that's probably because of how young they are. This story also brings up controversial topics that the last one tried to do, but only a few understood (namely techies and the technological singularity and such) and the drive of a man who's lost his loved ones compared to two children who never had anything in the first place. Also, fault milestone 2 had so many tricks up its sleeves, from expanding on what we know from fault milestone one to outright changing the point of focus in two lines. There are more cliffhangers though, which (of course) makes me excited for fault milestone 3... or three... however they decide to word the number.","January 2","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
