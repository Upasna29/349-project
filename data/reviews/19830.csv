It's a game I enjoy so much I bough a steam copy just for backup purposes.\n\nThe end of an era, it marks the last great tactical shooter on the market before this series descended into mediocrity. Nothing else since this has come close to equalling its quality of brutal, unforgiving tactics. This is a game that wears its realism on its sleeve and isn't afraid to let you drop dead from one bullet fired from a guy you couldn't even have seen coming. You move slowly and even walking throws your aim way off. Repeated autofire might as well be fired with your eyes closed. Guns feel weighty and impactful, dropping enemies in one or two torso shots.  It's harsh and doesn't feel remotely fair at times, but having smooth, flawless success in this game is more satisfying than any other shooter I've played.\n\nUnlocking all the maps requires playing through the campaign mode, where the iffy team AI and permanent injuries/death to the squad members can make things frustrating, but if you take the time to plan things out they usually go well. The game has no tolerance for the slightest mistake, for even a single corner left unchecked, and requires awareness and caution you rarely need in other games.\n\nThe real fun comes with friends. Competitive modes are fine, but nothing's better than the sheer teamwork it takes to clear out a whole map in co-op. And the sheer disaster that can strike if any one of you slips up for a moment. Multiplayer no longer functions out of the box, so you'll have to take alternate methods to get it work, such as Hamachi or Tunngle, but it's well worth the effort. Still one of my favourite coop games of all time.","September 18, 2015","true","15.3"," 47 of 49 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","47","49","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seriouscatnz/recommended/19830/","seriouscatnz","SeriousCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seriouscatnz/","365 products in account","Rating: 9/10\n\nRainbow Six III is a squad-based tactical shooter set in the beginning of the 21st Century. You lead a counter-terrorism unit called RAINBOW, assembled from elite soldiers from NATO countries. As can be expected from the Tom Clancy universe, the story and missions essentially boil down to there are 'bad guys' going 'bad stuff' and you have to stop them. There's a lot of nostalgia surrounding the reputation of this game, particularly around it's depiction of realistic squad operations in tight environments. From a realism perspective there are significant issues with the game, but from a gameplay perspective this is one of the finest tactical shooters ever made. Most engagements occur at less than 30 metres, and enemy fire is accurate, responsive and highly lethal, so the margin of error is small. It's essential that you use proper positioning, team tactics, and the appropriate tactical aids to suit the environment.\n\nIn reality, special operations are meticulously planned down to the smallest detail. Typically, the environment is reconstructed in a training ground, missions are planned by the second, and the mission is practised for hundreds of hours before the real mission ever takes place. If an event demands an urgent response, with no time for practice, special operations still still require an extremely detailed mission plan. This aspect of special operations is realistically modelled in the game using pre-mission planning tools. You are given a map of the entire grounds and can set a sequence of way points, go-codes, and special actions (e.g. throw flashbang, face direction). You can choose to have the AI play out the entire mission, where you will only be issuing go-codes from the command centre. Alternatively, you can play as a single operative and command the squad in person. You can switch between squad members, queue orders across several squads, and issue a single go-code to activate all orders at once (e.g. breach and clear a room from three different entrances at once).\n\nFriendly AI is fairly limited in the unmodified game to either following the planning sequences or following the player controlled operative. Planning ensures that team members will follow precise instructions, but they'll be unable to do anything else. Without pre-mission planning, friendly AI is limited to following the player and firing at visible enemies; they will not face to cover the player's side and rear flanks. Enemy AI is limited to three behaviours: (1) Patrol; (2) Stand and shoot; and (3) Walk towards the sound of gun fire. Raven Shield 2.0 (ModDB) is a graphics and AI improvement mod which dramatically alters friendly and enemy AI. However, enemy AI will still have difficulty hearing gunshots from afar, and can't work in groups or use tactical positioning.\n\nThe equipment available is fairly standard to shooters, including a variety of standard primary (e.g. M16A2 assault rifle) and secondary firearms (e.g. M92 pistol), as well as tactical aids in the form of grenades (e.g. flashbang, concussion, fragmentation, smoke). Given the limited range of engagements there is virtually no bullet drop, and small arms accuracy is depicted realistically. Weapons damage is also depicted realistically, but only for unarmoured opponents.\n\nArmour protection is not modelled realistically. Armour gives users a maximum of 2 hit points, which affects the entire body. Regardless of where targets are shot, they will no longer be able to run. The US National Institute of Justice (NIJ) classifies levels of armour protection for police officers. Level III armour consists of two solid metal plates covering the front and back of the torso. In reality, Level III armour stops virtually an unlimited number of pistol calibre rounds and at least half a dozen 5.56x45mm NATO rounds, with very little backface signature (i.e. deformation of the inside of the armour plate). However, in the game a single 5.56x45mm NATO round, or three 9x19mm Parabellum rounds, will incapacitate the target.\n\nFragmentation grenades are not modelled realistically. Confusingly, frag grenades have their real world effects split between frag and concussion grenades in the game. Frag grenades only do damage within a blast radius. Concussion grenades will kill everyone in a small room through the concussive wave reflecting off the walls, floor and ceiling, but are completely ineffective outside of small rooms. Conspicuously absent from the equipment are wide angle night vision goggles (NVG), though this may be because the technology was not developed or publicly known when the game was being developed.","December 11, 2013","true","105.9"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","35","38","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/19830/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3 Gold by Tom Clancy is a third game in Tom Clancy's Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six franchise. Which was realistical tactical shooter, where you would create your own plan for the level and then execute it, being excited to see how your dumb AI teammates will get slaughtered this time. And yes, it uses "one shot, one kill" system, almost. Released in in 2003 by Red Storm and Ubisoft, it also had console ports for Xbox, PS2 and Gamecube. Consoles ports were different: no planning, you command only one 4-man squad and each got few hitpoints.\nThis is Gold, meaning that it comes with inclusion of original Raven Shield game and the first expansion pack - Athena Sword, that mostly adds few more levels, released in 2004.\nThere also was a second expansion pack, which was almost finished (probably meaning that it just didn't go through debugging), Iron Wrath. It was released for free in 2005 on Internet anyway. Meaning that people were happy, aside from 56kb modem users.\n\nSo, technical stuff. While main menu and planning phase work at 4:3 resolution, gameplay itself supports widescreen resolution. But it doesn't change FOV, so you will be seeing chubby people. But it crashes sometimes when you change between planning phase and execution phase. So always save your plans!\nExpansion packs are a bit weird in that they will not play their new sounds, that are briefing voice acting and new sounds for new weapons. To fix that, you will have to go to mods folder, find folder of needed expansion pack, and then copy "Sounds" folder from there to the root directory of the game.\nYou also will have problems installing free Iron Wrath, as installer will not recognise Rainbow Six for what it is. To fix that just check Steam Guides. In nutshell, you will have to create new key in Registry where retail version of a game keeps all the needed info about itself. You don't have to screw the system itself, don't worry.\n\nAs for multiplayer, well, you could play in either coop or competive. It used old Ubi service, but as of now, multiplayer is technically dead. I heard that at some point you was required to use UPlay account instead, but it didn't work for me.\nEDIT: Because turns out that my actual login, that is email, is way too long for the game. HA!\n\nIn this game you play as anybody of Rainbow Six squad, the point of which is to make terrorist think that they are dealing with six pony-loving hippies, only to be met with eight aim-botting hard-try top operatives. But because it's a top secret squad and it's actions are written off as actions of special forces of whatever country they are in, the shock tactic of the name just never works. Just use flashbangs for that.\nWell, in this part you are dealing with neo-nazi terrorists who love taking hostages, listen to briefing and watch occasional cutscenes that make you feel good and even heroic for a job well done. Which is nice. It has ending video, so that's enough.\n\nAnother thing to note is that Rainbow Six is full of only top-top-top people, only the best individuals from separate parts of world. And then, after collecting them all, no one bothered to teach them how to work as a team. The only thing they ever learned is that they are supposed to walk in a line. And even then it can go wrong in small hallways, where a leader of a line will turn around and start pushing the tail out, as it refused to turn around, until his heavily armored butt slides out from the doorway and gets filled with bullets, while you scream at the screen in observation mode. Good bullets. Shiny, sturdy, can survive from -50 to +50 degrees of temperature. Must be 7.62x39mm ones. A bit outdated, but good bullets indeed, tactical-realism fans approve.\nNo, really, I got to see that few times.\n\nBut really, AI in single-player game can do a lot of things to sabotage the fact that game relies on squad-based tactics.\nAnd well, let's say that Rainbow Six 3 isn't as best ever as fans tend to call it.\nOr at least it didn't age well.\nAnd when I say "didn't age well", what I mean is "SWAT 4 came out". Which was not only more tactical, but implented proper AI teammates. No planning phase though.\n\nAt least graphics and music in this game are still nice. Even got ambient music sometimes playing during mission and such. And ragdolls look funny nowdays, just crashing onto floor. Blam.\n\nAnyway, since fans of tactical-realistical games always brag about such games and on question "what is tactical exactly?" they answer only "ummmm... you are too stupid to get", here is what you get to expect: Abuse leaning around corners when you are controlling a soldier; Abuse the aimbotness of AI teammates and place them in such way that no one walks behind them; Throw smoke grenade to become invinsible for AI; Try to come into difficult room from few directions with different teams. Those four rules is what makes this game. And planning.\n\nYou get into mission and first thing you get is briefing. After that, you are going to set up a plan. And oh boy, that's the main feature of the early games of franchise, as you get to put waypoints for up to three teams. You can also coordinate them together by setting go-codes. Tell them to throw grenade or breach the door. Actually, you can either try to beat level with no plan like generic realistical shooter, use pre-made one, use pre-made one and edit if neccersary or just make up a whole new one. And it's just awesome that you can make the map play out the way you want.\n\nUntil you will find out that AI can't open door slightly and throw grenade in, like players. Or bounce grenade at the wall, limiting the usage of flashbang. Or that they have tendency to never stop at waypoints and fire full-automatic while walking. Or that they will never decide to wait for enemy come out if they hear "huh, that's strange". Or the way you can't order them to throw smoke grenade down the tunnel in the third mission, so it's only up to player. Or just find out that some tasks AI does really badly.\n\nIn other words, while it DOES require tactical planning, but for dumb AI. Through trial-and-error of execution you will find what AI does best and judging by this you will build your plan for dummies. Which takes away some enjoyment.\nIf you try to pull something clever in this, you will have to do dirty job with your own hands. And even if you build a good plan, there is a bit of randomness on placement of some terrorists, so it can sometimes go wrong anyway.\n\nAfter that, you set up a squad, pulling 8 members for a job and separating them into teams. While wondering what's the point of Demos, who just make some objectives complete few seconds faster, and recons types. After that you look at huge list of samey weapons that you don't care about, pick the strongest/favourite assault rifle and put silencer onto it, as there is no real tactical choice. Unless sniper rifle. Then you look over some more useless devices, including multiplayer-only, which are in campaign for some reason, or like tear gas grenade and gas mask.\n\nThen you start execution and watch the new way your team getting slaugthered in some wacky way on the first minute, then beat remaining mission as a lone wounded machine gunner, slumbering with broken legs and getting through by abusing leaning, which is how I did pre-last mission. Actually, that was slightly fun. But only for once.\n\nBut really, the main reason to recommend it is the lack of alternatives. No other tactical FPS outside of Rainbow Six has detailed planning, as far as I am aware! So it's sad that Ubisoft wasted this part. New R6 games are still nice, but should have kept feature that was making franchise unique.\nNot as sad as lack of SWAT4 on Steam though.\nAnd for epic main theme that overloads nostalgia.","September 30, 2015","true","28.0"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","84","32","38","10","2"

Here is why;\n\n-Realistic AI. The enemy AI will execute hostages if they see the player, run if they are outnumbered, and even surrender to trick the player into letting your guard down, so that their friend can shoot the player in the back!\n-Lots of weapons, gear, and customisability. One can customise not only their own soldier's weapons, gear, and armour, but their teammates as well.\n-Planning. The game allows the player to set waypoints for their team and AI teams, and the AI teams will automattically follow. One can even set "Go codes" to make the AI wait for the code to begin an action, such as breaching.\n-The multiplayer still works. One can set up their own dedicated server in a few simple steps. See my discussion post for help.\n-Lots of fun game modes and maps. This game has many fun game modes, such as Lone Wolf (terrorist hunt alone); Terrorist Hunt (kill all the terrorists); and Hostage Rescue (self-explanatory). It also features classic maps such as Peak, Presidio and Prison.\n-Fairly good graphics. While these graphics aren't amazing, they still hold up well today.\n-Non-linear maps. Play your way.\n\nSo, if you have played Rainbow Six Vegas 1 or 2, come see what the classic games were like!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wryyl/recommended/19830/","wryyl",":wq","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wryyl/","332 products in account","I love this game. This game was one of my very first gaming experiences. Before Neopets. Before Pokemon. Before my PS1 and Xbox. Before Warcraft 3 and Diablo and all the other good stuff. I used to play this all the time with my dad, and as such constitutes some of my fondest childhood memories.\n\nAnyway, let's dive right in.\n\nThis game has technical issues. The menus are locked to 800x600 (?) resolution, though the game itself supports much higher resolutions. It did 1080p just fine for me. However, due to the different resolutions, your resolution will fluctuate whenever you enter/leave the menus. Kind of annoying, but no big deal. You better get used to the low resolution though, because you'll be spending a lot of time in the planning menu. Which brings me to my next point...\n\nThis is not your typical action FPS. It's relatively slow paced and you spend a lot of time planning things out. There are 3 teams you can customize. You can outfit each team member with different armor, weapons, weapon attachments, various types of grenades, and various utility tools. During planning you can dictate where your teams go, how they go there, what they do when the reach there, etc.\n\nFor example, you might want green and gold team to wait for your signal ("Alpha, go!") before they clear a particular room.\n\n- Want one team to throw a smoke and the other to throw a flashbang before doing storming the room? Done.\n- Locked door? No problem, tell them to breach it first.\n- Hostages? Throw some tear gas in. Don't worry, you can outfit your guys with gas masks.\n\nThere is a ton of ways to complete missions. You can take control of a team as well, and co-ordinate with the other teams in clearing a level.\n\nAI sometimes spotty. On occasions the AI will get stuck bumping into one another, or they'll be looking in stupid directions while taking fire. Most of the time though the AI is quite capable. You'll see your teams moving in formation, covering for one another. They'll strafe into rooms. I've actually been saved by my AI companion more times than I can count, so they're certainly not a burden.\n\nThere is auto-aim, but you can turn it off. You can also configure how sensitive you want the auto-aim to be.\n\nThere is a lot of trial and error. Your plans will not work on the first try. You'll be going through the level halfway when one of your teams starts getting killed off. Then you'll go back to the planning stage and try to rectify the flaws in your master plan. Maybe green team should throw a smoke before storming this particular room. Maybe you should reposition gold team so that they can better cover fire for green team. This is as much a strategy game as it is an action one.\n\nAnother this is that death is permanent. You have a roster of soldiers, and if they die during a mission, they will not be available for subsequent missions. This gives you an incentive to complete missions with minimum casualties. Soldiers can be wounded too, making them move slower and have slower reflexes. Wounded soldiers recover after a couple missions.\n\nThis game is fantastic, but it's not for everyone. It can't really be compared to anything else on the market. Unfortunately the Rainbow Six series is no longer the tactical shooter it once was.","August 13, 2014","true","13.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","2"

The main thing is gameplay. And gameplay is really great.\nAt the beginning of every mission, we have briefing. In the briefing we'll know our objectives, how many terrorists on the level and other information. Then we should choose who will go on the mission. There are more than 50 persons in the game. We can choose evryone from the beginning, we mustn't unlock them during the game. Then we equip our operatives.We change their uniform, weapons, gadgets and others. After equipping our team, we should have a plan. This is the most interesting thing in the game. We make checkpoints to our team. Our team will go to these checkpoints. Also we can point, where should operatives throw grenade, or where should they wait another team.\nAfter we are ready, we are going to the "battlefield". We can control EVERYONE in our teams. Usually on missions there are 2 or 3 teams. Usually you should kill all terrorists or rescue all hostages. Sometimes you should deactivate the bomb or  plant bugs in the computers. Terrorist die from 1 or 2 shots. But you also die from 1 or 2 shots, so this game is hard.\nThe graphics are still good for our days. Yeah, not Crysis, but Raven Shield is from 2003! The controls in game are not comfortable, because there are a lot of options: open doors silently, order your teammates, change operative and etc.\nAlso there is cool multiplayer. There is not a lot of players, but it is not hard to find them. Usually on servers you should eliminate all terrorists. Also in Gold Edition includes Athena Sword, short campaign with new objectives, operatives and new missions with time limit.\nThis game is very cool, the best tactical FPS of all times.

I'm not saying this due to opinion. The name 'Rainbow Six', in the Tom Clancy universe, refers to the leader of the multi-national counter-terrorism SOF 'Rainbow'. In every Rainbow Six up to this one (original, Rogue Spear, Covert Ops), you take that role; assigning team members to squads, choosing each member's loadout, creating a plan for each team to carry out during the course of each mission. Then you can either spectate or take control of one of the teams. You really can't even compare or argue the Rainbow Six games that came out after this because they are basically a different genre with different fans.\n\nPost-Rainbow Six 3 (Lockdown, Vegas, Vegas 2, etc.) you only take control of a single protaganist throughout the entire game. You can't plan out the mission because the missions are linear and setpiece-focused, much like traditional FPS games. And while the Vegas games were still fun and you were still a member of Rainbow, you did not assume the position of the commander, Rainbow Six, in these games.

Though I did enjoy them, The Rainbow Six Vegas games were a little watered down to cater to the casual gamer compared to Raven Shield and Athena Sword. In fact, I believe this was the last decent and truely "realistic" tactical FPS. There are tons of maps in this game that allow for play styles varying from precise, patient and meticulously planned long range engagements to savage, fast paced and adrenaline fueled Close Quarters Battle. There is a massive selection of weapons, attachments, class specific items and even ammunition types allowing the player to tailor their kit to their play style. The armory is bigger than any game that I can think of. Because of this, the replayability of this game is endless.\n\nWhile it continues to be surprisingly entertaining for a game released in 2003, it is beginning to show it's age and lacks some of the innovative features seen in modern games. The player cannot look down the iron sights of the weapons. Unless optics are mounted on the weapon, the right mouse button only causes a zoom effect. Also the graphics are a bit obsolete. The installation of the Ravenshield 2.0 mod fixes this, however, by improving textures and adding many of the features (including iron sights) that we as gamers have become accustomed to in the last decade.\n\nTo summarize, if you haven't played this game and you crave a challenging, thinking man's tactical shooter over the mindless run and gun FPS' you get these days you need this in your Steam library. If I can play this game consistently for over a decade without it getting old, I'm pretty sure you can get at least 100 hours out of it.

Only have played Rogue Spear\n\nWhat do i think of this game ? Well, coming from a person who have been playing Spunkgargleweewee, i really enjoy\nRainbow Six 3 Raven Shield\nI would say it's an almost perfect sequel to the 2 older games, Rogue Spear and the original Rainbow Six.\nHaving better graphics and surprisingly, first person view models. Texture is better, character models are well detailed\nGameplay-wise, it's still the same old Rainbow Six game; Slow-paced, u die very easily and u only get one chance.\n\nThe game is pretty fun and frustrating at the same time coz u'll never know what is gonna come up next. Clearing rooms, wide areas, u wont know whether u'll die or not and that's the point of being tactical. Cover the corners, make sure that the room is clear, using different grenades to ur advantage.\n\nIn conclusion, if u're a fan of Rainbow Six, this is the last Rainbow Six game right before the Vegas series to stand true to the old Rainbow Six vibe. I recommend u to pick it up and just play it. Although the online experience is pretty dead but there are a few servers that has players in them.\nIf u're NOT a fan of Rainbow Six, it is ur choice. Whether u like slow-paced shooters or not, i highly recommend it.\n\nI'd give this game an 8/10.

Each shot is not a toy, but a terrifying panic-enducing alarm which you must keep a level head through to survive.\n- Damage makes sense - shot with a 9 mil? Are you wearing armor thick enough to stop it from killing you? Your leg is injured, you are limping and bleeding in pain. That shotgun is too close, there is no surviving that.\n- Monumental gameplay mechanics (described in my rant below)\n- SO MANY MODS!\n\nCons:\n- No online servers left alive (aside from 4 or 5 hard-to-find custom servers)\n- AI is overpowered in some moments and stupid in others\n\n\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3 - were to start? I have infinite praise for this game.\n\nThis game is undeniably aged, but the gameplay mechanics still remain a pillar of tactical shooters to this day. Whether you go on a mission with a team of expert counter-terorist operatives, or you head into a mission lone-wolf, alertness and strategy is key to success - your life, your team's lives and the lives of helpless hostages all depend on your execution, which cannot be anything less than perfect.\n\nBefore each mission you may chose from a range of multi-national Rainbow Operatives to accompany you on a mission. Each operative has his/her specialty - be it alertness, stealth, leadership or skills with various equipment from breaching charges to sniper support to clearing rooms in close-quarters combat. It is up to you to decide each member's loadout (primary, secondary, type of ammunition, accessories, armor type, etc.,) You may chose to go in with a single squad or split up into 3 separate squads. Then comes the fun part - mission planning: drawing up a master plan takes time and dedication to carrying out a successful mission with zero casualties. Doing so you can rely on your fellow squad members to carry out your plans perfectly automatically - while you are sweeping the basement another squad that you assembled will sweep the roof for you, according to plan. But beware, everything relies on perfection.","January 8, 2014","true","7.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The levels are great and complex, but some may prove to be too much of a challenge, with some of the most unforgivingly tough gun combat you'll face. As hard as it can get, this instead left me craving for more for some reason.\nEnjoyment is however, marred by a few technicalities to the likes of the occasional dumb but crazy aimbotting enemy AI and slightly underwhelming gunplay. What's more annoying is the incompetency of your own teammates, who may fare well in the easier levels but get completely obliterated in certain, more assault-oriented levels. Ultimately it doesn't matter how much strategic map planning comes into play, it all boils down to the player's own level of FPS skills for the best success, which puts into question the real importance of the tactical aspect.\n\nRegardless, this game goes far behind SWAT 4 as one of the best tactical shooter I've ever played.

The game also makes sure you actually care about your teammates because if one dies, he (or she) is gone for the campaign.  RvS also sports a very large weapons arsenal that competes wiht today modern shooters.  The only real downside is that the multiplayer isn't very active (unless you want to play on modded servers, not my personal preference).","July 30, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a one of the last true tactical fps's that makes a good attempt at being realistic instead of cinematic and flashy. Rainbow Six 3 is unforgiving and challenging, however, it does not solely depend on your twitch skills like many newer tactical fps's, instead you must use cautious strategy to clear each individual room. One of my favorite features in the game is terrorist hunt which gives each player in a multiplayer game a team of men that they may order to do things such as frag and clear a room. If you are looking for a tactical fps that manages to be extremely intense while requiring a slower but much more intelligent and cautious decisions than you will surely enjoy Rainbow Six 3.","January 1, 2014","true","57.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(Vegas)\n\nIt's often compared to the likes of Counter-Strike, and I'd honestly say that it's better. This is because it adds a lot more to the table in terms of weapons, game modes, maps, decent AI opponents and team mates, as well as allowing you to perform more actions; as an example, you're able to 'fluidly' open doors so you can silently open it a crack to peep through, just swing it open, or even put a breaching charge on it.\n\nIn terms of weapons/gadgets you can use, other than having literally a mountain of guns to pick from, (although I always say the FNC and Steyr AUG are the best ;) ) ranging from assault rifles, sniper rifles, sub-machine guns, shotguns, light machine guns and pistols (including automatic pistols), there are a whole load of grenades and other equip-able items you can pick from. For example, there are of course your typical frag and flashbang grenades in the game, but there are also CS teargas (and gasmasks you can take to counter this) and smoke grenades. Not to mention the various other explosives and utilities, such as claymores + remote detonators (no magic hostile presence-detecting ones like in other games), C4 explosives, heartbeat detectors and many more.\n\nAlso, the iron-sight haters won't have a problem with R6 3:RS either, as they've still got the good ol' zoom - which shouldn't be an issue for those who dislike the zoom, as there are plenty of choices with scopes of varying types, as well as other attachments for your weapons.\n\nSo yeah, essentially if you want to play a realistic and fun shooter with loads of different tactics and choices, get this!","April 26, 2012","true","76.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This adds to the games diversity and you feel a real sense of leadership as you command your troops. Also the game is alot more realistic to other FPS games, in RS3 if you take a couple bullets you die and if you happen to live you dont have any method of regaining your health as there are no health packs. This is one of the elements that makes the game so tactical, the minute you come under fire you become so cautious and become alot more aware of your surroundings looking for cover etc. The troops make you feel a sense of security to a degree but the minute you lose a man you really feel the loss and again become more and more cautious knowing your out numbered. However when you craft a tactical raid on a room full of terrorists with your team and neutralize the enemy with precision you also feel a great sense of achievement. The game has a gradual learning curve and the levels become difficult at a nice pace.","October 4, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Quite unlike any modern-day shooter games. If you're after realism and fun this game is for you. Best part of the game quite possibly is the ability to plan the missions and execute them in perfection. Managing the routes taken by each squad and the "go codes" to synchronise the assault.\n\nI have never came across a game to date with this kind of planning its a real shame the way Ubisoft have strayed the franchise, making it similar to all of the rest of the shooters.\n\nThe game is tough and unforgiving, usually ending a life with a single shot. If a person is KIA in the game they are permanently gone. Thus if you are a perfectionist it will take a while to get round the map, you're taking your time, leaning slowly around every corner.\n\nBe warned, can become stressful after a hours playing & planning and then final terrorist kill you.

Raven Shield and the other original Rainbow 6/Rogue Spear games are true tactical counter-terrorism simulations, based on real weapons and tactics used in modern day counter terrorist operations. You plan your mission, you don't get to save during a mission, and it's one-shot and you're dead. No regenerating health, and when an operative dies it is final. I love Raven Shield because of the punishing difficulty, and emphasis on being the first to spot your opponent and quickly aim for the head. I think this is a good representation for close quarters combat, as close as you can get to real life.\n\nI love this game, and it's sad to see the Tom Clancy and Rainbow Six licenses being sold down the river. Everything after RVS and Athena Sword has been dumbed down garbage for the masses. Rainbow Six was never meant to appeal to the call of duty or counter strike crowd, it was in a class of its own. I got this game when it came out in 2003 and I just re-installed it, and it's as good as ever. I've beaten the single player 4 times, twice on elite, and it doesn't get any better than the feeling of successfully completing a mission with no fatalities. I have spent countless hours on multiplayer, which is also great too.

Pure excellence - it's the last great Rainbow Six from the long running series, at least in terms of tactical gameplay. The rainbow six vegas games put an emphasis on action and nonstop brawl over the slow, tactically and "smart" gameplay that dominates the 3 first games. It takes what made the first 2 excellent and further pushes it. Some still say Rainbow Six: Rogue spear is the pinnacle of the series but i still feel the 3rd installment is the best one. It gives you the tools and gameplay to push Rainbow Six as far as you want it to go. It's emphasis is more on the neutralization of targets and objectives and it's somewhat more "intense" then say for example Swat 3/4 which has a focus on doing things with the bare minimum of violence. Rainbow Six: raven shield gives you all the tools to do what you feel works best, being less lethal takedowns with flashbangs, or the brute force tactic of breaching charges and frag grenades - all the tools are there to be played around with for one of the most interesting tactical shooters in the last 15 years.\n\nMust buy for any tactical shooter junkie.","March 7, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nice feature is when you do die,  you respawn very near if not in the same spot where the 'oops' took place.  If you are looking for a Run-n-Gun shooter, this is not for you.  If you are looking for a tactical, near realistic shooter .......what are you waiting for ..... get it already!","February 22, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pure excellence - it's the last great Rainbow Six from the long running series, at least in terms of tactical gameplay. The rainbow six vegas games put an emphasis on action and nonstop brawl over the slow, tactically and "smart" gameplay that dominates the 3 first games. It takes what made the first 2 excellent and further pushes it. Some still say Rainbow Six: Rogue spear is the pinnacle of the series but i still feel the 3rd installment is the best one. It gives you the tools and gameplay to push Rainbow Six as far as you want it to go. It's emphasis is more on the neutralization of targets and objectives and it's somewhat more "intense" then say for example Swat 3/4 which has a focus on doing things with the bare minimum of violence. Rainbow Six: raven shield gives you all the tools to do what you feel works best, being less lethal takedowns with flashbangs, or the brute force tactic of breaching charges and frag grenades - all the tools are there to be played around with for one of the most interesting tactical shooters in the last 15 years.\n\nMust buy for any tactical shooter junkie.","March 7, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well my disks gave up finally such a nice box and everything so reignited the set through steam at a reasonably low sale price and glad I did. It still holds up even though I know the maps inside out you can still alter your approach tactically and yes I still get killed. The AI is still merciless but when I have a 'casual' hour I open this game...............(note); do not play casually or your team will get 'wiped out' as our controller states all too often through the mike. Yep! you really do still need to concentrate your moves even after playing all these more modern shooters etc. Tactics, squad selection still are priority as are weapon choices. It's nice that the 'heartbeat' monitor is still there though for some of us ;) A great old spec force game set with both games attached. I wouldn't imagine that multiplayer is still around but who cares! This is still a great game to go back to especially at elite difficulty and by yourself (Lone Wolf). 7.2/10 as a vintage score also.","November 15, 2015","true","41.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The circle crosshair is the sole means of aiming most weapons that are left in standard configuration, but an optic can be added to many longarms, and a version 2.0 mod., available from moddb, allows for aiming with Iron sights. Weaponry can not be picked up from enemies during a mission. No content is locked, all is available to use from the start. Leaning, stance change (standing, crouching, and prone), and stance adjust are available, but peaking around corners from an over the shoulder or third person vantage point is not.

This game favors tactics over action, and you will spend hours planning out each mission before actually playing it. Before a mission, you can choose who goes on what team (Alpha, Charlie, etc.), choose their loadouts (a lot of weapons to choose from, each with their own advantages and disadvantages), and plan out the mission waypoint by waypoint. Once you are comfortable with how the planning stage works, you can coordinate attacks from multiple angles, give go-codes to execute orders, set the rules of engagement, and so on. The game gives you the option to either play through the mission or watch the AI do what you have told them to do. It's a really nice option, because it's basically two totally different styles of gameplay. You can play it as a strategy game, being the man calling the shots, or play it through the eyes of a Rainbow operative.

Hard and complex .. it requires a thorough study of the strategies to successfully complete the mission.\nThere are not so many missions, but some are quite difficult, because the AI does not forgive anything .. it's really excellent.\nEqually important is to preserve the best men in the group, because as you go ahead with the campaign .. things get more difficult.\nHighly recommended, all players must try at least once a unique experience that gives you this game.","November 21, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game is more tactical and more realistic. You must plan ahead. In the beginning, the planning phase is confusing, but you get ahold of it after a while. I haven't played the multiplayer since I couldn't log in with my Uplay account, and I would like to try the co-op to play with my friends.

I enjoyed Vegas 2 immensely as well but Rainbow six 3 is just superior. It is so amazing when you set out a complex plan and have your team execute it successfully.\n\nThe shooting in this game is also quite fun and there is a good challenge to it. This game is all about setting up a strategy for your 1-8 team members (each are unique and have their own stats like sniping, electronics, etc), in which you can create 1-3 fire teams and set up complex orders for them in the planning stage. You can set "go codes" which mean a team will wait for a player order to set up a synchronized attack (such as having gold team breach and clear and green team toss a tear gas grenade in, while red team sets up a sniping potion to protect the flanks).\n\nThe missions are fun and have excellent map design where multiple different strategies can be executed. There is perma-death for everyone so you must be careful with their lives.\n\nThe AI while basic at times can be quite intelligent. It can flank you, toss grenades, retreat to a different area and even surrender (careful sometimes a surrendering enemy will have an enemy their to flank you when you try to cuff the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥).\n\nThis is a game for a more intellectual FPS gamer and is the best Rainbow Six game out there (I've played them all except siege but that is nothing like this game at all). This game runs perfectly at 1080p (although the menus/movies don't but it is still fine) and I have not had a single issue with it at all (I have mostly played on a non-steam version but have just bought this one for the included expansion pack).","December 5, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its worth buying at sale time for $5. You should get about 40 - 80 hours out of it. Be sure to have a look at gameplay and reviews to see what its like (apparently is quite different to the newer Rainbow Six games) in that it is very tactical, think SWAT 3 and SWAT 4.\n\nAlso, in terms of multiplayer I cannot comment as I haven't played multiplayer.\n\nSingle player is great. You get about 17 missions in a campaign and 8 skirmish maps to play on for Rainbow Six 3, and a campaign with about 8 missions and 8 skirmish maps for the Athena Sword add on pack included in this Gold Edition. Also, you can download for free the Iron Wrath expanision pack which adds even more missions and maps (there is plenty of info out there about how to get this going for the Steam verison).\n\nThe missions are usually about killing or terrorists, saving hostages and diffusing bombs in a tactical way. A fair bit of time is spent planning and replaying the missions and this may be a turn off for those who just want action. A few other modes are available including terrorist hunt, hostage rescue and lone wolf that add to replayability. There are about 60 odd guns in the game with everything from submachine guns to sniper rifles plus things like CS gas and stun grenades.\n\nDownsides:\n- A fair bit of time is spent planning as opposed to playing eg a usual mission will take about 10 minutes of planning and 5 minutes of action but expect to be replaying the mission and doing the planning phase plenty of times over.\n- Enemy and friendly AI can be really bad at times.\n- Old game (2004?) so graphics aren't going to be great.\n- I'd say buy it at sale time for a big discount as at $10usd you may feel ripped off.\n\n","April 4","true","31.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Exteremely quick (and in the campaing, permanent) death, slow movement and the ability to carry only one rifle, one sidearm and 6 grenades at most are somewhat realistick but don't believe it when people call this game hyper realistic. The game's immersion is broken easily by things like hip-fire reticlespread applying even when using a scope. The relatively braindead ai is a known problem, but it doesnt matter because the enemy isn't supposed to do anything else than react to hearing gunfire and fire at you when they see you. Your teammates on the other hand do just fine, because they do as they are told and don't improvise anything stupid. Except when they decide to fall off from a ladder and die, forcing you to restart the mission. The pseudo-randomized enemy placement and the sometimes unreliable teammate ai make sure that however well you plan your missions, you will need at least one retry before you get the desired no casualty -run. The fact that planning your mission can take up a good 20-30 minutes and executing the plan take a rough 5 min depending on mission. That is, if you get it working on the first try. Fixing your plan between retries can easily take up a cumulative 30min unless you have to redo the plan altogether. All that combined and you can waste an evenening just trying to complete that one hostage recue. The game can be very frustrating on the other hand very satisfying when you finally complete that one mission. Despite everything negative I said about the game, it is in my opinion an enjoyable experience. Just as a word of warning: This is not an fps Dark Souls, in this game you move a lot slower but die a lot faster. You can end up 6 feet below in a literal heartbeat.

Both Vegas games have their fair share of problems, including bad third-person cover systems, enemies that spawn behind you, nonsensical instant deaths, sound glitches, and (in the case of Vegas 2) a sprint function that makes the multiplayer feel more like a slower CoD than a tactical shooter. Everyone on the internet told me that RS3 is better in every way, the definitive tactical shooter.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nRainbow Six 3 has enemies that can't hear gunfire from 10 feet away or see their friends die right in front of them, but they are quite capable of seeing through brick walls and hearing footsteps from across the room. On more than one occasion, I died at random, one time by an explosion that didn't have an accompanying grenade or terrorist.\n\nThe weapon selection is decent, though I find it hard to find anything to be excited about. You can customize your weapons by choosing between features like an extended mag, a scope, or a silencer. Some weapons have multiple ammo types which don't really matter in a terrorist hunt. Character customization does not exist, but it isn't really needed.\n\nMovement is slow, but that's to be expected. What isn't expected is the painfully slow sidestep. Having manual control over the motion of opening doors, crouching, and leaning is interesting and will probably be useful for hardcore players. The most welcome function is the ability to lean around corners. That's what tactical shooters are: Q and E to lean. Not recommended.","February 24, 2014","false","4.8"," 6 of 59 people (10%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","10","6","59","2","1"

It can still be fun to play with people, granted they know what they are doing. The game may have some technical flaws (it being old). If you want to play good old Rainbow Six without wrestling with the Original's engine, pick this one up.\n\nRainbow Six 3 is a squad based, tactical shooter. This game allows you to take control of the elite counterterrorism unit RAINBOW (yes, that's the name of the unit).\n\nThis game is not something you rush into. You need tactics. The game has an entire planning phase where you can modify how each group of operatives moves. You can tell them to wait on your mark, then when you give the go-code, open the door and flash through it.\n\nMultiplayer still works, however you have to have a uPlay account. You could try lan or hamachi, but I didn't test that.\n\nThe game has a mutlitude of weapons and armor for you to choose. You can use silenced smgs with flashbangs and go full on stealth, or use 50.cal snipers and M4's with frag grenades to go all out.\n\nThis game is also not as easy as your usual FPS. You get a maximum of 1-3 hits before your dead. Everyone follows this rule. Once someone's dead, they can no longer be chosen, so make sure your teammates don't die.\n\nThe game also has some mechanics that I've never seen any other FPS have before, or after. These are the fluid lean and door opening. Using the mouse, you can adjust your character to lean at many other angles other than one. Fluid door opening allows you to open doors halfway, a tiny bit, or just enough to let a grenade through.\n\nThat said, the game has flaws. The planning stage is locked at ~800x600 (the game isn't but the menus are). The game can sometimes be a bit hard to get into, and you may have to do levels over and over to make sure your preferred teammates didn't die. This game is way different than alot of FPSes out today (Call of Duty, Team Fortress, and Battlefield aren't very comparable.

I have been playing it since its release and have to say, that this game does not get older at all!\nOne of the main issues is the number of maps - it is more than 15 and if you buy the 'Athena Sword' expansion pack, then you have dozens of them. Also the choice of guns is impressive - you can pick from higher number, than in e.g. CoD Ghosts.\nBut what makes the game unique is planning and executing the plans. You need pick at least one soldier (up to 8 with 4-men limit per squad) and here is your choice. You may plan exactly your actions, so that you do not need to even touch the keyboard, because the soldiers will do everything for you. You may play it as a shooter (though much harder, than the new ones) or play a 'hybrid' version - plan some key actions -e.g. synchronize the assault of one room (with a hostage for example) and attack it from two sides. It doesn't matter, which playing style you enjoy more, because it will be great anyway.\nIf you're a fan of a true gameplay, not high quality textures, and enjoy playing tactical shooters - this game is for you!","December 24, 2014","true","113.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played Rainbow Six on the console and I beat it once... only once. The game has you playing against Supersoldier-Nazi-terrorists from the future, seriously you should watch the intro... that's the only way I can explain the story, for America. You thought CoD: World at War was deep? This game is deeper. This game is about fighting for America.... in Switzerland.\n\nAs a fun, challenging game, Rainbow Six has you taking control of up to three teams and with you planning out their movements along with placing checkpoints yourself. As you start the mission and having your teams following their pre-constructed paths, they will all inevitably die to the incredible aim of the Super-soldier-Nazi-Terrorists (I always manually take control of teams and members to make sure no one dies). Still, it was much easier than the console version which basically had you and three other guys (or four, I forgot) with no backup and running into a whole lotta crossfires and traps. Men get blown to pieces by Terrorists with their grenades and you will get cutdown mercilessly by molten metal fired from the barrels of hidden guns.\n\nThis game is easier, with the ability to pre-plan your movements and the ability to take control of multiple teams and team members. This game isn't about twitch shooting or aim, it's about precaution. Precaution as in, "Don't run in clear view of a sniper you dumb♥♥♥♥." The game doesn't hold your hand and requires a lot of luck at times, but in all honesty it is how you plan and how you plan to execute it along with a plan B if everything goes wrong. If you find firefights too frustrating, the game even allows aim assist (the equivalent of aimbotting). You have to anticipate the ♥♥♥♥♥iest situations and how to deal with them. I like the weapons, most of them have different stats and have situational advantages during some missions. However, shotguns are completely inaccurate unless you've got a scope on it (which I find strange).\n\nTeam members also have stats and it somewhat rewards you for keeping them alive. The more men survive through missions the better stats they get, so they can aim better, run better, etc. Always keep stealth team members with other stealth team members otherwise the other dudes in the group will give them away. Having a balanced number of team members and organizing their equipment is actually.... fun.\n\nI get to choose what weapon to use, what grenades I want and who I want with me. Yeah, the game can get frustrating at times, but mostly it is your fault if you lose. You have to observe enemy movement, study their patrol paths and watch them intently then plan actions accordingly. You can't run in every room throwing a smoke grenade because of your limited supplies. The heartbeat sensors actually make the game easier because you can see where terrorists are going through the walls and doors (console game had thermal vision). You're never supposed to fight the enemy head-on not unless you've put yourself in a advantageous situation (i.e. smoked room enemy can't see you, flash bang renders terrorists unable to fight back etc.).\n\nMultiplayer is also a blast, if you ever get to play just use your Uplay account username and password. I had to play with three or so other guys against hordes of terrorists in the other room with us throwing tear gas this way and that. There are plenty of wonderful pvp and pve levels that has you killing terrorists on top of buildings, in cities, on boats and wherever the strange and unique level designs take you. Did I tell you I got to fight Nazi Terrorists... IN SPACE?!\n\nGo buy it but keep in mind it's tough difficulty and sometimes frustrating nature.","July 14, 2014","true","58.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsiCkstar/recommended/19830/","mrsiCkstar","mrsiCkstar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsiCkstar/","100 products in account","This game is the benchmark against which I measure all other tactical shooters and trust me when I tell you that practically no other game that has come out after Raven Shield measures up to it. SWAT 4 is very close but RVS comes out on top. In Rainbow Six 3 you take control of an international counter-terrorist unit called Rainbow and your job is to prevent terrorists from doing whatever it is that they are trying to do. To achieve this you use the powerful mission planner to plan your mission to the finest detail, coordinating up to three teams or a maximum of eight operatives. The planner will let you do anything you need to do to get the job done. For example you can set up go-codes to clear a room from multiple directions simultaneously. You can define how the teams make entry into a room: should they breach the door using a breaching charge? Should they throw in a flashbang or gas grenade before entering the room? You get the picture. You can also define the rules of engagement and movement speed of your teams for any waypoint. You can command them to be stealthy and only fire when fired upon for example or you can make them run and shoot on sight if you need to cover ground quickly to get to a hostage or bomb. The planner is awesome.\n\nAfter you've finished planning your mission you can equip your teams any way you want. There's a lot of gear to choose from. There are light, medium and heavy armor and they affect your stealthiness and speed. Light armor is quiet and stealthy but does not offer much protection. Medium is a great balance and heavy armor looks kind of like riot gear and gives you extra protection but all your actions like switching weapons, turning around etc take a little longer to complete. You'll also be louder when you move. Then there are the weapons. There's a huge selection of SMG's, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, pistols, machine pistols, grenades etc. There is also a selection of tactical gear like heartbeat sensors, demolition kits (to speed up defusing of bombs), lockpicking kits etc. You can equip each individual operative however you want.\n\nWhen you get in the mission itself you can switch between teams and operatives to control them at any time or you can stick to controlling your guy and let the AI do it's job according to the plan you've set out for those teams. The friendly AI is very good. The trailing guy will cover the rear of your team and they are very aware of their surroundings and they are accurate as well when firing. They're also good at clearing rooms. They get through the door quickly and each operative will cover their own area of responsibility in the room. You can command your AI team mates on the fly to perform actions like clearing rooms using breaching charges, flashbangs, gas grenades etc. You can also command them to pick locks, defuse bombs or to escort hostages out of harms way. You can perform these actions yourself also. The damage modelling is pretty awesome. You suffer different effects depending on where you're shot (if you're lucky enough to only get wounded that is). Your aim suffers a lot if you get hit in your arm for example. You can't run and your walking slows if you get hit in the leg and so on. Good mission planning is crucial because you want your team members to survive the mission so you can use them again. You have a limited number of operatives of varying skill levels and specialties and if they get wounded they will need time to heal before you can use them again. If they die you lose them for the rest of the campaign. The sounds are awesome too.\n\nThe enemy AI could be a little better although there's nothing in their behaviour that would get really annoying during gameplay. Sometimes one of them will drop a grenade as he dies and after it goes off you can hear "huh, what was that?" from the next room as if you can't tell when a frag grenade goes off in the hallway. They're pretty good at coming to investigate noises and stuff like that and they will use cover and get backup if you miss your shot and they get away. On the hardest setting they can be pretty brutal and it's tough to complete missions without any casualties to your team unless you've planned it perfectly.\n\nAfter you get the hang of the game you can get online and you'll find there are still people playing. You can play adversarial modes or you can play the campaign missions co-operatively with your friends, coordinating take downs etc. using teamspeak for example. Multiplayer requires a ubi.com account and the game does lack voice comms of it's own but those are not big minuses.\n\nThe game is still every bit as awesome as it was when it came out. The graphics are a bit dated but it will run like a dream in very high resolutions and with ridiculous amounts of AA and AF on. With those kinds of settings it looks pretty good. Also you can get a mod called Raven Shield 2.0 that will enhance the realism of the game to even higher levels adding things like iron sights and it also has higher resolution textures for the operators and terrorists enhancing the look of the game. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of tactical gaming and has somehow missed this gem. This is the best tactical shooter out there.","February 12, 2014","true","69.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The environments are all urban/indoor and the missions are very fast paced, just like real urban ops. The mission planner adds a lot of depth to the strategic side of the game. Picking out your team, their load out and their waypoints/actions and then watching it unfold as an observer is extremely addicting. Sometimes I prefer observing to being with the boots on the ground because it's so satisfying to create a flawless plan.\n\nThe gun selection is execellent(My favorites: G3A3, G36K, MP5A2/10mm) and they perform convincingly like their real world counterparts. Co-oping Terrorist Hunt mode is really intense and one of the best parts of the game. I HIGHLY recommend the 2.0 mod which re-skins everything in higher resolution, adds iron sights, goggle vision,  and other small tweaks for more realism. I don't have much faith in Ubisoft to do the next Rainbox Six installment any justice. Raven Shield will most likely remain the best of the series, so make sure it's in your collection.","April 23, 2013","true","68.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is arguably the funnest tactical shooter ever and this is the game people point to when asked about a more tactical and professional feeling Rainbow Six game than the action games like Rainbow Six: Vegas. Being a game from 2003, the graphics look a bit rough, though that doesn't hurt the gameplay at all. You play as a sort of commander for the elite, international, blacker-than-black ops team Rainbow. Rainbow specializes in counter-terror and hostage rescue missions and are deployed when needed around the globe. This means that the levels take place across a variety of settings. You'll go from saving dignitaries in the Swiss alps to foiling bank robbers in London to clearing a mansion of baddies in the Cayman Islands. This keeps things unique and interesting throughout the game.\nEach mission has a set pattern to it. You start by learning about the situation from Rainbow Six, the leader of Rainbow, and the other advisors with him. You then go to the team room where you select which operatives are going out on the mission, select their guns, armor, and other equipment, and choose what teams they'll be on. Then you go to the bread and butter of the game: the planning room. You are given a blueprint of the area and tasked with creating a plan for the teams to follow that will result in a successful mission. The planning system does take a bit of time to master but once the get the hang of things you'll find that the planning system is robust and customizable with a great depth to it. Once you have a plan created you can choose what team you'll be leading, in first person shooter style, through the action phase of the mission.\nThe action isn't as fast-paced as other games, but the methodical and tactical way that you can move through the area is unique, very enjoyable, and by no means boring. The action gameplay can shift from stealth to sychronized takedowns to all out gunfighting at a moments notice. The operatives and the terrorists all react realistically to bullets, meaning they die near-instantly. If that sounds too tough for the more tactical-minded gamers, you can also choose to observe the plan from a third-person flying camera and let the A.I take control of the operatives on the mission. You'll invariably find your plans don't always succeed, but there's much fun to be had from tweaking your plan until the teams move through the level like a well-oiled machine; to qoute the A-Team, "I love it when a plan comes together." On a related note there are pre-made plans that you can load in if you find the planning system too much to handle or are frustrated with repeated failures.\nThe last great feature of the game is the custom mission option. This gives you access to all the maps that you've unlocked in the campaign and some that are only available in this mode and allows you to create a random mission from a good amount of mission types. Replaying story missions, terrorist hunt, hostage rescue, and lone wolf wherein you are alone and needing to get to the extraction point. The custom mission feature garuntees that you won't get bored with this game. Add to all the goodness explained already the fact that there's still a thriving modding community keeping this game fresh and adding better graphics and more gameplay to this already massive game and you've got a shining gem of the tactical shooter genre that still hasn't been topped in the decade that it has been out.","June 24, 2013","true","64.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not the Vegas series or Lockdown, mind you, but every game up to 3, and 3 is the best installment. It's one of the most realistic shooters you will ever play. You cannot rush into a confrontation without thinking or you WILL die in one or two shots. The best way to go through a mission with minimal casualties is to plan it out beforehand. When you're making a mission plan, you'll need to prepare for any situation, and even then, the enemy can surprise you, and one slip-up could ruin the entire operation. It involves a lot of trial and error, but once you finally make that one plan that has your team blaze through the mission with zero losses, you WILL feel proud of yourself for getting it right. In fact, once you get the hang of planning, you won't even need to control your squad directly anymore. The game allows you to watch the AI carry it out for you, and they're usually very competent. If you love tactical shooters, buy it.","November 8, 2011","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played Rainbow Six on the console and I beat it once... only once. The game has you playing against Supersoldier-Nazi-terrorists from the future, seriously you should watch the intro... that's the only way I can explain the story, for America. You thought CoD: World at War was deep? This game is deeper. This game is about fighting for America.... in Switzerland.\n\nAs a fun, challenging game, Rainbow Six has you taking control of up to three teams and with you planning out their movements along with placing checkpoints yourself. As you start the mission and having your teams following their pre-constructed paths, they will all inevitably die to the incredible aim of the Super-soldier-Nazi-Terrorists (I always manually take control of teams and members to make sure no one dies). Still, it was much easier than the console version which basically had you and three other guys (or four, I forgot) with no backup and running into a whole lotta crossfires and traps. Men get blown to pieces by Terrorists with their grenades and you will get cutdown mercilessly by molten metal fired from the barrels of hidden guns.\n\nThis game is easier, with the ability to pre-plan your movements and the ability to take control of multiple teams and team members. This game isn't about twitch shooting or aim, it's about precaution. Precaution as in, "Don't run in clear view of a sniper you dumb♥♥♥♥." The game doesn't hold your hand and requires a lot of luck at times, but in all honesty it is how you plan and how you plan to execute it along with a plan B if everything goes wrong. If you find firefights too frustrating, the game even allows aim assist (the equivalent of aimbotting). You have to anticipate the ♥♥♥♥♥iest situations and how to deal with them. I like the weapons, most of them have different stats and have situational advantages during some missions. However, shotguns are completely inaccurate unless you've got a scope on it (which I find strange).\n\nTeam members also have stats and it somewhat rewards you for keeping them alive. The more men survive through missions the better stats they get, so they can aim better, run better, etc. Always keep stealth team members with other stealth team members otherwise the other dudes in the group will give them away. Having a balanced number of team members and organizing their equipment is actually.... fun.\n\nI get to choose what weapon to use, what grenades I want and who I want with me. Yeah, the game can get frustrating at times, but mostly it is your fault if you lose. You have to observe enemy movement, study their patrol paths and watch them intently then plan actions accordingly. You can't run in every room throwing a smoke grenade because of your limited supplies. The heartbeat sensors actually make the game easier because you can see where terrorists are going through the walls and doors (console game had thermal vision). You're never supposed to fight the enemy head-on not unless you've put yourself in a advantageous situation (i.e. smoked room enemy can't see you, flash bang renders terrorists unable to fight back etc.).\n\nMultiplayer is also a blast, if you ever get to play just use your Uplay account username and password. I had to play with three or so other guys against hordes of terrorists in the other room with us throwing tear gas this way and that. There are plenty of wonderful pvp and pve levels that has you killing terrorists on top of buildings, in cities, on boats and wherever the strange and unique level designs take you.

At launch, this game was well worn out by me and my crummy disc drive back in the day. I probably played 200+ hours total of this game, and half of those hours spent on Lan or on Ubisoft servers. This review will partially be based on those good and memorable times that I had, as well as the time that i spent owning this game over Steam. So if things sound unusual and out of perspective, it's probably because of me remembering the good ol' days of fast and tactical games. (Also not to mention the amount of bias put into here.) So, without further ado, here's the actual review...\n\nThe Rainbow Six games have always been a special gem in my heart. It's slow, creeping suspense and sudden firefights have always left a warm feeling in my heart. The old ones kept me in excitement, with every day of school meaning a night of fun with my friends and I. Rainbow Six 2 was always personally my favorite, giving the most diverse and exciting gameplay of its time. It was great.\n\nHowever, those times ended, and my faith flew out the window when I was surpised to hear the next day that Ubisoft bought Red Storm out of the blue. This made the bright shining gem in my heart turn into a dark, twisted gem that I couldn't possibly light up again. How could Ubisoft create a great, diverse Rainbow Six game that follows the rules and dynamic systems that the previous installments had? I had little hope left, but something told me I had to try it. And so I bought the disc...\n\nAnd it was AWESOME!\n\nI shouldn't have let Ubisoft down. They left a hole in my heart, but somehow, they still managed to create a great game like all the rest. It was a polish of Rainbow Six 2, complete with weapon models, HD texture, and not-so-braindead AI. It was the most fun tactical shooters I had.\n\nRainbow Six 3 not only delivered the game to the fans, but delivered it with passion. It was such a great game that they couldn't have possibly dissapointed. The singleplayer was great, competative online was good, and LAN Parties over Co-op was the BEST. Even to today, I still invite my friend over with his PC, have some pizza, and play a little bit of this exhilirating shooter.\n\nAnd then this Steam version came out, and, although the multiplayer services are down, (Thanks Ubisoft, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s) you can still get a good time out of this game.\n\nSo, as expected, here is a rundown of the scores...\n\nGameplay: 9.5/10\nGraphics: 7/10 (Better than COD and BF though)\nMultiplayer: 9/10\nEnjoyment: 10/10\n\nRecommendation: Everyone should give this game a try, but Rainbow Six # aims for tactical people who like to have a little fun with their friends. (And possibly not have friends anymore.... Just saying)\n\n","February 24","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I spent 61 hours on it.\n\nOnce you figure out the interface, planning out missions gives a satisfaction linear military shooters will never have, and once you figure out how to handle firefights and clear rooms you'll feel Operator as hell.  Permadeath and the complexity of planning might make this game suboptimal as your first tactical FPS, but still try it if you're not willing to hunt down SWAT 4.  Partial door opening and leaning are absolute brilliance, too bad your teammates can't toss a grenade through a door crack.\n\nSmoke grenades are great, don't take hours and hours to realize that like I did.  Don't go out of your way to make complex plans, especially if they require parallel movement (reserve that for particular sections and rooms).

There are a lot of tactical options, but somehow they made it all intuitive to where you can just do the training, and jump right into the first missions and probably beat it on the easiest level.\n\nGameplay 10/10.  Maps are well thought out, and immersive.  Enemies act how you think they would act for a given difficulty level.  Example:  They don't just mercilessly mow you down right out of the gate on easy, and on hard they pretty much do lol.  When I get killed, it's always been because I missed a guy hiding, wasn't patient enough, etc.  I have yet to feel like the game is cheating, using cheap exploits, etc.\n\nStory...  2/10 It seems to be be pretty rudimentary.  Elite strike force, assault, recon, or infiltration missions with brief backstory ("Terrorists are occupying an oil refinery unless their buddy gets released.  Go kill them.").  I have not finished the base game yet, so maybe there is something more to come here, and shooters just didn't have plots as a general rule in the good old days, but it would have been nice to flesh it out a little more.  It is what it is.  The game is fantastic, but don't play it expecting a Skyrim type story.  It's purely a tactical shooter as far as I can tell at this point.\n\nOnline play - Have not tried it yet, though I read in forums some people still play.  Will try it after I finish the solo campaigns.\n\nDLC - 10/10.  Comes with one expansion (Athena Sword), and another is free to download, although it was a bugger to get installed (Iron Wrath).  Honestly, this is a game I see myself playing every map in every expansion too, so I'm happy for the extra content.\n\nOverall - 10/10.  I find myself not really caring about the story while I am playing, because it's that tactical rush, and the controls and game play are so well thought out it's HIGHLY addictive.  I compare the combat to the last game I played, Skyrim Legendary Edition.  I constantly felt like Skyrim abused the somewhat clunky and sluggish combat mechanics unfairly, was TOTALLY unbalanced in parts, although I loved it.  I never get that feeling with R63.  You CAN beat the missions if you know what you're doing.  Sure, that occasionally means level memorization and trial and error, but it's actually pretty fun, and I've even replayed some missions just to see if I could do them better.  This game is a GEM, and I find myself wishing all games were like this, and not caring about the somewhat dated graphics.  Actually, I kind like the graphics.  They don't get in the way or slow down my PC, very functional and kind of a retro appeal.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED especially at $4.99.  Some of the other trash on here for $4.99 makes me laugh in comparison.","February 10","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a lot of tactical options, but somehow they made it all intuitive to where you can just do the training, and jump right into the first missions and probably beat it on the easiest level.\n\nGameplay 10/10.  Maps are well thought out, and immersive.  Enemies act how you think they would act for a given difficulty level.  Example:  They don't just mercilessly mow you down right out of the gate on easy, and on hard they pretty much do lol.  When I get killed, it's always been because I missed a guy hiding, wasn't patient enough, etc.  I have yet to feel like the game is cheating, using cheap exploits, etc.\n\nStory...  2/10 It seems to be be pretty rudimentary.  Elite strike force, assault, recon, or infiltration missions with brief backstory ("Terrorists are occupying an oil refinery unless their buddy gets released.  Go kill them.").  I have not finished the base game yet, so maybe there is something more to come here, and shooters just didn't have plots as a general rule in the good old days, but it would have been nice to flesh it out a little more.  It is what it is.  The game is fantastic, but don't play it expecting a Skyrim type story.  It's purely a tactical shooter as far as I can tell at this point.\n\nOnline play - Have not tried it yet, though I read in forums some people still play.  Will try it after I finish the solo campaigns.\n\nDLC - 10/10.  Comes with one expansion (Athena Sword), and another is free to download, although it was a bugger to get installed (Iron Wrath).  Honestly, this is a game I see myself playing every map in every expansion too, so I'm happy for the extra content.\n\nOverall - 10/10.  I find myself not really caring about the story while I am playing, because it's that tactical rush, and the controls and game play are so well thought out it's HIGHLY addictive.  I compare the combat to the last game I played, Skyrim Legendary Edition.  I constantly felt like Skyrim abused the somewhat clunky and sluggish combat mechanics unfairly, was TOTALLY unbalanced in parts, although I loved it.  I never get that feeling with R63.  You CAN beat the missions if you know what you're doing.  Sure, that occasionally means level memorization and trial and error, but it's actually pretty fun, and I've even replayed some missions just to see if I could do them better.  This game is a GEM, and I find myself wishing all games were like this, and not caring about the somewhat dated graphics.  Actually, I kind like the graphics.  They don't get in the way or slow down my PC, very functional and kind of a retro appeal.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED especially at $4.99.  Some of the other trash on here for $4.99 makes me laugh in comparison.","February 10","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LDKEona/recommended/19830/","LDKEona","Legendary Dark Knight Eona","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LDKEona/","586 products in account","When I think of the word "tactical," Rainbow Six 3 holds true to this word in every aspect.  Having played lots of modern first person shooters released nowadays, there's no newer modern fps I know of that is anything like this game.  I'd like to mention that I haven't touched the PvP in this game since it's pretty much dead from what I've seen, but I've experienced the campaign and co-op along with terrorist hunt, hostage rescue, etc. And I must mention that I was using the Ravenshield 2.0 mod through out my time with Rainbow Six 3. So here's what I feel the game does well at, and what it could've improved in certain areas.\n\n+Very nice level of customization for weapons, gadgets, and soldiers.\n+Very large amount of weapons to choose from.\n+Lots of maps to play with; you can even use MP maps for solo plays.\n+Customizable missions for terrorist hunt, hostage rescue, lone wolf, countdown.\n+Less linear type of game, providing you with multiple ways on completing your objectives. From stealth, pure assault, or even both. Plus, using variety of weapons and gadgets to your preference.\n+Good level design.\n+Customizable squads up to 3 teams: Red, Green, and Gold.\n+Preplanning is an amazing feature that lets you plan all your movement, and how you want you and your team to approach rooms inside any map, etc.  Any tactical game nowadays could use something like this.\n+Challenging A.I.  They are pretty well designed enough for allowing you to play this game with tactical approach.\n+Lots of tension, especially when playing at higher difficulties.\n+A.I. spawn is somewhat randomized, so each playthrough should never exactly feel the same.\n+With its good level design, preplanning, and customizable squads, it feels like there's a sandbox touch to the game. Because of this, you're provided with freedom and that gives very good amount of replayability, encouraging you to experiment.\n+Rewards player with patience, skill, and careful movement. Seeing yourself beat missions can feel satisfying.\n+Co-op is simply amazing and a real blast to play, especially when you and your partner(s) are going lone wolf; lots of communication and coordination together is encouraged to fully get the best experience possible with co-op.\n+Playing it as a strategy game is possible with the help preplanning and spectator mode...so far with all these features, I don't think we could ask for a better SWAT-like game to be honest.\n\n-Team A.I. can be dumb at times, this can be irritating.\n-Hostages' location never change every time you start a new mission.\n-While the enemy A.I. is challenging, they can also be dumb at times, too.\n-Night vision is pretty terrible.\n-You can't pick up ammo or weapons from dead enemies.\n-Stealth mechanics aren't very well done, as a matter of fact, there's very little room for that.\n-Difficulty progression in campaign isn't consistent, I've actually found some earlier levels harder than the later ones.\n-Few reused maps in campaign (for me that's a no no), I always felt maps are a huge part of gameplay.\n\nRainbow Six 3 is a damn fine game and should be in any tactical game lover's collection. Even with some of its flaws, I can say without any doubt that this is easily one of the best tactical fps I've ever played. The sandbox touch to the game made so much difference to my impression with the game. The only other Rainbow Six games I've played are the Vegas games, and while they are fun, great games, they play nothing like its grand daddy. Now, I don't recommend this game to those who are into more arcade or fast paced fps, because R63 is nothing like that. Otherwise, for $9.99 excluding tax, it's easily worth that considering the amount of content and fun it provides. Go for it.","November 8, 2015","true","49.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
