When trying to become Queen I got stabbed, shot, poisoned, burned to a crisp, and rule 34ed Japan style.\n10 out of 10, would die again.\n\n\nLong Live the Queen is a Visual Novel game that, instead of trying to simply win the hearts of others and fall in love, you try to survive the horrors of royal life with your head intact.  Of course, it doesn't help when everyone is a bloodthirsty murderer who's only desire is to bring forth the death of a fourteen year-old girl.  Seriously, what the hell is wrong with them?\n\nYou take the role of Princess Elodie, who needs to be trained to be a proper queen because Disney dictates that no princess is allowed to have a living mother.  You end up making all the decisions because your father is a lazy bum who's shirked off all of his responsibilities, but for some reason won't let you have your mother's keepsake.  The kingdom is a mess, everyone is evil, and no matter what you do you just can't seem to save this poor little traumatized girl.\n\nThe mechanics of the game play on themselves in a bit of a cycle.  You can upgrade Elodie's stats; which can increase slowly or rapidly based on her mood; which is based on events that have happened; which are based on your choices as well as her stats; which are upgraded accordingly based on her mood; which is ba-- ah you get the idea.  This means that every decision, even the first one, can drastically affect how the story unfolds.  No two games are alike, unless you purposefully do everything in the exact same way every time.  But that's boring.\n\nBecause of the above mentioned do-it-all-the-same concept, you can technically beat the game as many times as you like after you find out how to do it once.  But beating the game is not where this game shines.  Sure, acquiring the crown and becoming Queen Elodie is a grand event in itself; only if you get there (because you will die, and die a lot).  But one of the greatest things about this game is the ability to make different choices every time and see where it leads you.  Find out what is down each path and discover what you can and can't get away with.  And more importantly, unlock all the outfits because they're cute.  Proper wardrobe is the pinnacle detail between ratty princesses and pristine queens.\n\nAll in all, it is a great game and I'd recommend it to anyone.\n\n\nWait... you can learn magic?  HELLZ YEAH!","October 20, 2014","true","4.3"," 523 of 551 people (95%) found this review helpful 164 people found this review funny","95","523","551","164","6"

I mean Duchess of Sudbury! I am actually trying to work on my royal demeanor, I swear, okay? Life is just so crazy! My moods are so erratic lately.\n\nSorry I can’t make it to your party! My reflexes and archery skills are way below 50, Lore is just sooo much more interesting.. and bandits are everywhere. I even had this bad dream about traveling, and even though I’m not 100% sure it was related to your party, I’m going to stay on the safe side. I’m sure you understand, though, right? I’m sure you would prefer receiving presents from your ALIVE friend rather than, well, not.\n\nYeah, okay so I know you *might* not trust me because of that other timeline where I held Lottie hostage… but I had my reasons, okay!? I’m sure you know how it feels when everyone is judging you and you’re just like ah, how am I supposed to feel -Pressured?!\n\nIt’s hard being our age and in charge of so much stuff. But hey, at least I sided with you when I *did* go to your party that other time!\n\nDo you have timelines or are you just.. like.. stuck? That would suck. OMG, I hope you have more than one outfit! O_O\n\nAnother reason I hate not being able to go to your party this time (because every time feels fresh, okay? my room is always just the way I left it..)  is because I really wanted to pick up Briony!! All of her letters were annoying at first but we’re lovers in another timeline. Isn’t that sweet?!? So I figured I could get some early action. ^_^  Nothing with a squid, though! I told you about that poem, right? Sometimes I thought was hilarious, sometimes I just got angry about it.. have you gotten anything like that? Just wondering…\n\nI might be +Lonely about not being able to go to your party, but you should be +Cheerful about the presents I sent you!\n\nDon’t worry, they’re not chocolates. I would have sent you some apples from my garden—they’re so delicious they’re known to be stolen!—but I would hate to send you—my friend, a duchess—an apple beaten-up by travel. So when the roads are safer you can just come here and we can have all the delicious apples we want, and even play with toys just like old times!  Ps xf dbo krtu pru. ^_^\n\nOh, and to answer your question, I have no idea why my dad doesn’t have a top lip. Like, sure, keeping a stiff upper lip is sound advice. But he just doesn’t have one in the first place!\n\nYour friend,\nElodie\n\nP.S. My handwriting is worse than Adair’s, but who cares?!

You make choices that effect the story and various paths to discover and explore (Its possible to complete the game with nothing in combat). However, one event at the end can not be changed no matter what choices you choose which causes the game to be somewhat linear. The music was diverse and amazing in my opinion and helped set the tone of the game depending on the situation. Gameplay could have been better for example more scenes, and backgrounds. If you enjoy visual novels, this is a great game for you.\nHowever, I feel the price of the game is a bit too much for the amount of gameplay and would recommend waiting till it goes on sale if you plan on purchasing the game.","November 25, 2013","true","15.5"," 357 of 412 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","357","412","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thermaldrill/recommended/251990/","thermaldrill","Timo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thermaldrill/","366 products in account","This is a game of trial and error, educated guesses, and mood management. If any of those three things sound unappealing to you, you may want to stay away from this game.\n\nHave you ever played a visual novel? This game resembles one. Half of the game is background images with text boxes on top of them, and the other half is menus. However, this is not a visual novel. The story is very light in this game, and forgettable. This leaves the gameplay to keep you interested:\n\nYour princess has a large number of stats, ranging from singing, decoration and dancing, to swords, polearms and archery. You increase these stats by assigning two classes each day. At the end of a day, you choose from several different activities, which alter your mood.\n\nHer mood is important because it directly affects how quickly you increase skills during the daily classes. The "depression" mood happens to increase the "decoration" skill faster. Increasing skills is everything in this game, because it runs on a set schedule of story events. These happen at the same time and start off exactly the same, but the way your princess reacts to them depends entirely on how you've chosen to raise her skills. This is the mood management I mentioned. You are often asked to choose an action during story segments, and these can alter the story greatly - or instantly kill you.\n\nThe educated guesses and trial and error come from that, and of the fact that you cannot possibly predict when you will need a particular skill. Your princess will randomly be stabbed, poisoned, etc. and if you don't have the right skill high enough, that's all folks! The fun of this game is from starting a fresh game after each death, and planning how you will raise your princesses' skills this time to accomodate the story event you just died on.\n\nIf this doesn't sound like something you would enjoy, I would have to advise you to avoid this game, as it is ALL it has to offer. I personally got about ten hours out of it, and I'll probably go back for more someday, but this kind of experience may just not appeal to you.","November 25, 2013","true","9.5"," 249 of 278 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","249","278","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/251990/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","TL:DR? See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Long Live The Queen is an indie visual novel sporting the anime art style with the choice and decision system of a political intrigue game.\n\nYou play as Elodie, a 14-year-old princess who is to be crowned Queen of Nova. Play the game of politics where assassinations and threats of death are a daily occurrence. Be a skilled diplomat, a military leader, a powerful sorcerer or a little bit of all in your road to the throne.\n\nPROS:+ Art Style: -(This is subjective) Having the anime look will have the "you either love it or hate it" effect from people. Some people like it, some people don't. I personally like it.\n\n+ Planning Ahead/Consequence System: -This game does require the player to plan in advance by having a massive amount of attributes and skills that can be learned and mastered in a very limited way. Different players will have different skill sets depending on how they play through the game. Thinking ahead is a necessity to stay alive.\n\n+ Mood System: -You can only advance your skills through tutoring and schooling, unfortunately however, how well you level up and progress is dependent entirely on your character's mood. (example: Anger = Gives bonus to lessons with regards to Military and Weapon Expertise but has corresponding penalties to Royal Demeanor and Expression.)\n\n+ Good Difficulty: -Easy enough to learn but hard to master. I takes at least 2-3 playthroughs to get a general feel of the game but multiple playthroughs are recommended. This game requires experimentation and attention to detail to effectively win.\n\nCONS:- Way too short: -I finished this game under 5 hours in my original gameplay (including deaths, and restarts). This game is suffering from the same flaw as I saw on Recettear since the main campaign is just too short. I think the developers could have added more complexity in the game as well as extend the campaign past your coronation period. It would have been nice to continue playing as the "Queen" after said coronation.\n\n- Events not Random: -Though some events are triggered only by specific skills you possess at that time, all events relating to the main quest are virtually the same. This actually encourages the player to learn from his mistakes and try not to do it the next time around. Note that deaths in this game are instant game overs.\n\n- Not as Deep as I thought it would be: -I expected a level of political intrigue including empire management, army management, family and court management, but unfortunately this game only delivers the basics of those.\n\nCONCLUSION:GOOD BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE. I personally am satisfied with the game so I'm going to RECOMMEND it.\n\nPatience is a very important consideration if you are planning on buying this game. If you're the type who doesn’t want to do a lot of thinking and just want a casual experience, this game is not for you. If you're the type of gamer who likes life-sims, visual novels and enjoy choosing your own adventure, then this is game deserves your attention.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

You will die, and die, and die all over again. (unless you cheat and search for walkthroughs/guides, of course)\nGame Details\nGame play: Basically a story-driven visual novel with multiple paths that often lead to your character's demise. Most of the time, things will be different depending on the choices you make and the parameters you build as the story progresses. This is where the visual novel-feel kicks in. You save, die, maybe replay from the start or from your save, change a few patterns, then die again, think of relying for a guide and feel miserable for spoiling yourself.\n\nGraphics: Cutie-ish interface and outright anime-style character designs. Some of the fonts and the menu buttons doesn't feel right to me as I would prefer cleaner, crisper finish, but then again, this game is made to make a cute appeal to its gamers. I mean, have you ever seen a cuter way of interpreting a "death by tentacle" scene aside from this?\n\nAudio: Serene piano BGMs hit me hard on the spot, and there are tons of them to hear in this game.\n\n\nThe Verdict\nThis is a very well-made visual novel that has the anime style charm and a very deep story that is thoroughly translated through a complex and multi-ended game play.\n\nIf you are asking if this game is worth its value, my answer is "Yes, it is worth it".\n\nIf you would like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","December 23, 2015","true","4.5"," 116 of 120 people (97%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","97","116","120","13","0"

Elodie, the princess, in a simplified take on how royalty works is next in line for the then, but there's the catch, she's almost a year too young to take the crown.\n\nThe task here is to teach ehr the skills she needs to becoem a proper queen which includes such things as Animal Training, Art, Dance, Song, Running, Sports, Gymastics, Medicine, Espionage and Magic. Yes, Magic.\n\nAlong the way you must protect her form assassins, chocolates, psyco relatives, a commoner revolution, chocolates, a civil war, a forest that would make the Everfree pale in comparison, chocolates, sorcerers, chocolates, a sea monster and chocolate. Failure to do so will be a Game Over and will treat you to a humourous chibi carcature of the associated death. Her mood and wardrobe will determine how much knowedge she gets in a skill so any sudden mood swings will throw off your curriculum\n\nThe trick here is to know what skill are needed to avoid certain doom or pass checks needed to help her earn the crown. You will die a lot, you will save a lot and you will reload saves when you inevitably die a lot, primarely to chocolates, arrows, psycotic relatives, chocolate and the odd tentacle.\n\nI'd give it a 10/5.

I didn't expect to enjoy it but in the end, I had a lot of genuine fun playing.\n\nThe main mechanics in the game use moods to learn different school subjects. You pick two classes each week to take, each class raises your skill in the subject your picked. The events which you run into throughout the game (you get one event each week) are all virtually the same, but the outcome of each event depends on how you react and what classes you have been taking.\n\nThere are no fancy visual effects of musical scores apart from the over played British national anthem, the character designs are very pretty, even if they are a little cringey at times for a young girl to be wearing those outfits (anime eh). There is plenty of replayability in Long Live The Queen, I have done a number of different scenarios and runs and I have put almost seven hours into it, each time ending differently.\n\nI would totally recommend this game to anyone, even if you aren't a fan of anime (like me); the price is £6, 99 which for a game like this, is worth it. If you get it on sale, you have yourself a bargain.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/251990\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Then I was curious. And now I am convinced that the joke is on her. This game is actually addictive and has a very dark sense of humor. I still have not been able to get the princess to her coronation ceremony, she's died from poisoned chocolates, an angry rebel with a sword, the same angry rebel with a staff, an arrow to the gut from bandits, etc. I'm probably missing some example deaths, but I could just go check the badges I got each time she died if I really want to be reminded about how all my hard work came crashing down in a hilariously frustrating and unexpected demise.\n\nSo yes, if anyone is wondering why I have this many hours logged on this game, there you have it.

In fairness to Hanako's hard work, I've made some updates to be more objective and offer better context.>\n\nAs someone who loves both deep strategy games and the cutesy anime aesthetic, I was super excited after seeing the trailer for LLTQ. This game has SO much potential to be great, and for the first few hours it was.\n\nThe Good:\n\n-Love the art and music\n-The process of fiddling with your skills and moods and such is initially pretty fun\n-I love the flavor text that accompanies all your class activities. It's really immersive going through the "process" of learning skills in that level of detail.\n-Skill checks allow for lots of "little victories" that feel good, and the game makes it clear when you benefit from having the right skill. Elodie gets to have a lot of cool moments if you picked certain skills "correctly".\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-It's difficult to figure out what "mood" I need to be in to get the right bonuses for the skills I want. UI could've been a lot better in this respect.\n-Despite the wonderful buffet of choices offered in the UI, the game's strategy is actually very shallow. Most of these choices only affect optional story events and have no tangible impact on whether or not you win. Depending on your dialogue choices, it's possible to win with only 2 of the game's 42 skills leveled up.\n-Because of the lack of meaningful skill choices, players who are interested in working out different strategies to win may quickly find themselves bored.\n-The entire sequence of events happens on a fixed timeline, and unless you opt in to certain risks (whose rewards only affect your epilogue, and not your goal of surviving), you won't see much variation between playthroughs.\n\nDid I mention a huge number of the skills are useless? What's that? You leveled up Horse Riding? Too bad, there's only one (optional) event in the entire game where it does anything. There's actually a discussion thread on the LLTQ community where people are debating which skill is the most useless, and there are many strong candidates to choose from...\n\nConclusion:\n\nAs a strategy enthusiast, I'm disappointed with how this game turned out. The trailer makes it sound like there are numerous paths to victory, but that's based mainly on narrative choices and has little to do with your skills. I geeked out like crazy when I first saw the skill list, thinking of all the different ways I could play and the hours I could spend delving into strategy. Securing victory through trade, warfare, treachery, magic... But most of the skills are only useful for unlocking fluffy side story events. If you're a completionist who's really into tracking down all those little events and collecting the achievements, it'll probably work for you, but sadly it did not work for me.\n\nIt's a shame. There's so much I liked about this game. Hanako is quite talented and clearly put a lot of work into the game's strategy elements. I feel like if they'd spent a bit more time fleshing out those choices and making them meaningful, it would have been a hit for me. Maybe next time? =/","December 16, 2013","false","3.7"," 539 of 741 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","539","741","0","25"

I don't dispute that it's addictive, but I think it's addictive for the wrong reasons. Essentially, there's little strategy with "Long Live the Queen." It's all a gamble. Your princess' skills are like a roulette wheel: you bet on what you'll need, and chances are you'll lose. Even if you win in one instance, if you play too long, chances are the "house" will win. Your princess will die because she didn't study painting enough for an unplanned magic battle, or whatever other strange scenario.\n\nI wouldn't have a problem with this if not for how ridiculous it gets. For example, even if your princess is afraid of assassins, has become an expert in poisons, and doesn't know who to trust, if she gets random candy from a stranger she'll eat it. Not taking candy from strangers is common sense, but apparently that's a superpower she lacks. The only way she won't eat it is if she knows enough about production+trade, court manners, and/or has a puppy. Then she saves it for later.\n\nSome of these instances are kind of amusing, but the roulette-wheel feel is too palpable. I went from thinking I could win to not getting any gratification when I did. I didn't feel like I'd had to think much through, or plan. Instead, I just spun the wheel enough and learned what the game wanted me to do.","November 28, 2013","false","16.5"," 172 of 238 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","172","238","0","3"

I was expecting a cute little time-sink that I probably wouldn't play more than twice. The art style seemed simplistic and reminiscent of Magical Girl anime, and so I figured the gameplay would mirror that light-hearted lack of depth and character. How wrong I was..\n\nI can't really put it better than RockPaperShotgun did in describing this game as "a Sansa Stark simulator" (you can read the remainder of their brilliant and detailed review here - http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/10/long-live-the-queen-review/ ). Rather than a game of frills and frippery, I was suddenly plunged into a very maturely crafted world of political espionage, assassination, murder, magic, torture, civil war and straight-up cruelty that I never would have expected.\n\nThe game starts you off gently by introducing your newly christened Crown Princess to a host of potential suitors and courtly situations in a genial and cartoonish manner that only serves to further highlight the harsh realities that quickly become apparent, as your new Queen-to-be moves from a childish attempt to control her situation into very real dangers and political turmoil where survival is almost out of reach.. all while still struggling to act like the respectable monarch she has in no way been tutored to resemble. What's more, the various methods of near-certain death are flawlessly executed (pun certainly intended) to the point where the game even has a special gallery and achievement list devoted to your multiple royal demises.\n\nShould you actually manage to survive beyond the first couple of months in power, the dangers arrayed against you grow oppressively dark and encroach with ever-greater speed, even as you begin to unlock secrets and hidden power in a desperate attempt to meet them. Ware, lest you become a monster yourself in the process.

Soon she will become the Queen but up until then you must survive. The first step to survival is to teach her the right things in her daily classes - one morning, one evening. There's a multitude of subjects, each one changing event outcomes or consequences of choices you make. You could choose to learn how to be an elegant princess, and learn how to make public speeches to put on a great speech or maybe learn more about battlefield medicine, incase you come into a spot of trouble. You'll come across different events that each have different outcomes depending on what your princess knows.\nEach time you lose (ie. failing to survive), you know what to expect but might not still know the right path to take. You could choose to flawlessly succeed in one event, but maybe fail another because you didn't put enough time into learning about it. Victory comes from a bit of luck and a bit of skill through making the right decision(s). Each weekend you choose what to do, changing her mood.\nThe game is a text adventure, and the art to accompany it looks great. My inner anime side wanted me to get this game, and although it got beaten by 'Super Hexagon' (from 60p to 20p) in the 2013 Christmas Sale, I still got gifted bought the game. Additionally, you can get outfits for your princess, each one giving her bonuses in a certain subject. Overall, the game looks really good - a very 'cute' style with a great colour palette, and definitely catching the mood of the princess at all times. definitely a soft experience for your eyes to accompany the gameplay. The music is great too, with very fitting themes for all the events, most of them done beautifully on piano, meaning a great time for your eyes and ears!\n\nI love this game. It looks great, sounds great and plays great. Each time you lose, you come back prepared, but still unsure of how to go about it on the next playthrough. Overall, a great game at a great price too (but maybe wait for it to be on sale!).\n\nThanks for reading!","December 25, 2013","true","3.2"," 57 of 68 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","57","68","0","2"

I'm not giving it a negative review because it isn't... and I'm sure it appeals to the people who like putting cute girls in different uniforms, but Long Live The Queen's gameplay is pure, sheer trial-and-error. You spend your days in the castle, developing skills and learning how to be a good queen. Of course, Elodie can't be good at everything, so you have to pick which skills to develop and which to leave alone. This is all nice in itself, if it weren't for the fact that the game keeps killing Elodie in more and more contrived ways, and every time this happens, it's because the player didn't develop some kind of obscure skill enough. Which means you have to - and this is no exaggeration - play a few weeks until you die, then load your save again and gear all your skill points toward preventing that death. You need to do this every time. What's the point of playing a game if I have to die over and over again and can only prevent it by save-scumming and using foreknowledge?\n\nDecided to train Elodie to work with falcons rather than dogs? Too bad, because for some reason a high Dogs skill is all that can prevent you from being poisoned. It gets worse. You get challenged to a duel, and since you've got a good lot of skill points in swords, you confidently accept - only to see Elodie getting run through because whoops, the game decides to test against Athletics instead! I went to assist my troops to fight a naval battle, but did you think the game would check my (almost-maxed) Naval Strategy skill? Nope. Instead, it tests against Climbing and Meditation. Naval Strategy isn't even checked once. It does check against swimming, but haha, did you think being decent at it was enough? Nope, sleepy time with the fishes for you! Get challenged to a duel? You die because your Composure wasn't high enough and you, for some reason, decide to charge the inhumanly powerful mage that just obliterated your father.\n\nYeah, Hanako Games, I know replayability is a good thing, but try doing it in less cheap and lazy ways next time. A game like Vlad the Impaler, which gives you choices in crisis scenarios and then tests against your stats, does it right. Your game, which railroads crisis situations and then decided to test against a single skill, does not.","November 12, 2014","false","2.3"," 279 of 433 people (64%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","64","279","433","11","53"

For all the fame, fortune, and limitless invitations to balls, there are assassination attempts to fight off, rebelling commoners, war barking at the boarders, and an endless stream of plots to steal your crown. All of this and more is what awaits Elodie, the queen to be, as the impromptu death of her mother accelerates her path to the monarchy in Long Live the Queen, a game that is anything but what it appears.\n\nThe most important thing to know about LLtQ is that it isn't a girly diversion devoid of strategy and intended solely for would be princesses to live out their fantasies. On the contrary it is an absolutely brutal challenge of wits! Your time is split between taking classes and dealing with the day-to-day events that befall a queen, both of which are intimately woven together and require a keen knowledge to predict the outcome of the choices you make.\n\nAs you progress through the game you shape Eldodie into a princess of your choosing by way of the various skills you aquire by taking classes. You can only learn so much before push comes to shove and you need to put your skills into action, and finding the balance in it all is where the strategy really comes into play. By manipulating your mood you can gain bonuses to different skills, boosting the amount of skill points you earn in a session, which further adds another layer you need to pay attention to in order to succeed (or even survive).\n\nIt is all but a certainty that you will die many, many times before you make it to your coronation, however death in LLtQ isn't a gameover but just taking a wrong path at one point, and is intended to be a learning experience above all else. Because events typically unfold in a similar way each time, your main goal is to pick and choose which skills to upgrade in a timely manner in order to succeed and push onto the next plot point. Should you fail you can reload a save and try again with new tactics, or start over from scratch and plan your path in a whole different direction.\n\nThe freedom coupled with the inherent linearity is an odd combo but what I love so much about the game. It doesn't change so much that you can't easily plan for future events, but allows a lot of variation for different outcomes which gives a lot of replay value for those so inclined as to seek out the different endings.\n\nIt is also my biggest complaint about the game however, as for all its freedom it does a poor job telling you how to use it and leaves you floundering in the dark trying to find the perfect combo. Getting a "good" ending and seeing Elodie crowned is far harder to do than you would likely expect, and repeatedly dying with only vague mentions of what you did wrong and how to change it can be very disheartening and will likely put many off early on as they are still trying to work out how everything fits. I'm all for letting the player find the answers for themselves, but a bit more guidance would have been much appreciated for all the times I failed in ways that seemed no fault of my own.\n\nBut even with the bothersome lack of direction LLtQ is still an extremely addictive and original game, one that immediately sucked me in and kept me hook for hours at a time. It would be easy to get the wrong idea of the game from the screenshots, but I imagine many would be pleasantly surprised if they gave it a chance. The music is lovely and the artwork very nice, with a clean cut design and humorous, engaging writing that makes it hard not to fall in love with Elodie and the other characters around her.\n\nI have never played a game quite like Long Live the Queen, and hope to see more original titles like this popping up on Steam soon. If you are even the slightest bit interested don't turn away after the first impression, it has a lot more depth than I think anyone would expect, and is a wholly refreshing and enjoyable experience that most any should enjoy whether they have ever dreamed of being the prettiest princess or not!\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 8, 2014","true","5.6"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","33","38","0","0"

The sequence of events will never change, but what actually transpires (and if Elodie survives to eventually be crowned) are dependent on what choices you make and how you build her up. Ignoring a single skill in one playthrough could have a huge influence on the story, and since you can't max her out, you'll want to come back several times.\n\nI loved Choose Your Own Adventure books as a kid, and for the five bucks I paid, I had a lot of fun with the story and trying different things.

It is a complex look into the life of a young princess, caught up in a political maelstrom which only YOU can guide her through. You will need to think realistically about the life of a princess, and the skills she will need to succeed in the political world, while also balancing her mood. You should be wary of all manner of things, ranging from assassination attempts, to social or political faux-pas', both of which can cut short your political career.\n\nThe protagonist has a likeable personality, (for a fourteen year old) and a myriad of different outfits to choose from, each of which give specific boosts to a certain field of skills. The addition of these outfits make the protagonist feel like a real person, as real people also change their clothes to suit their vocations.\n\nOn a socio-political level, Princess Simulation Simulator 2014 could drastically improve the quality of life for any aspiring politician, or even just as a human being. The skill descriptions provide real world advice on how to improve, and generally are very helpful. I would recommend this game to any person who is the heir or heiress to a large fortune or amount of political power, as it is a very realistic look at the various challenges you might face. Furthermore, anyone looking to expand their wardrobe or fashion sense should play this game, as the outfits that the protagonist changes between are a breath of fresh air, and would surely go over well in any social gathering.\n\nI rate this game a total of seven stars out of seven, with an additional nine ghost points, to boot! The gameplay is fast paced and exciting, with never a dull moment to be seen. The dialogue is stellar, and I must emphasize that each of the writers of this game should be given the Nobel Peace Prize for their amazing work. However, the game misses out on the elusive tenth ghost point because I do not wish to appear to have been bought out by the developers of the game in order to give it a perfect review.","January 9, 2014","true","4.1"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","27","32","2","2"

You play through this gorgeous visual novel as a young 14 year old princess whose mother has just recently passed away and you are thrust into tending to the everyday matters of running a kingdom. From going to parades, giving public speeches, being the judge jury and executioner in court cases, leading your nation to war or diplomatically resolving your international disputes. But such a young girl can’t just jump right in and successfully run a kingdom; she needs to be properly trained.\n\nThe game plays out on a week to week basis where you start off by choosing 2 school classes you would like to take to train your queenly skills, and with 42 different skills to level up there is plenty of depth and variables to take into account that makes each choice feel meaningful, If you just choose willy-nilly without putting thought into what to level up you will definitely wind up just like your mother. The skills are either negatively or positively affected by your princesses’ current mood, for example if you are overly willful you may earn bonus points for taking a course in naval strategy or internal affairs whereas if you were in a yielding mood you would have a penalty for naval strategy or internal affairs.\n\nAfter monitoring your mood, and assessing which classes you want to take, and you’re skill points are distributed, you are then put into a dialogue scene where you are presented with various dialogue trees, events, and scenarios that either get passed or failed depending on whether or not you have trained enough in a certain skill, an example of this may be perhaps you are out in the courtyard and a snake crosses your path and strikes at you, if you have reached a high enough level in the “Reflexes” skill you will be able to react quick enough to avoid the attack and escape death. More often than not a crucial fail will result in your death, and that is where the game gets addicting, you keep wanting to go back and try to figure out what you did wrong and what you could have done differently to avoid your demise (most likely just to discover another way to die). The game is the equivalent of the anime version of Bill Murrays Groundhogs day, you’ll just keep reliving the same things over and over until you get it right, and quite frankly that style of game isn’t for everyone, it may become too repetitive for your liking or you may feel that you were cheated the way you died and you may become too frustrated to keep playing, but odds are that you’ll be back to try to live the 40 weeks to reach your coronation day and become queen.\n\nThe game offers plenty of interesting dialogue and has a beautiful art style; the art style paired with the brilliant piano sound track is truly an aesthetically pleasing combination.  The dark nature of the game is an overall exciting adventure experience and the high quality of both the visuals and especially the audio complement the game very well.\n\n\nhttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/","January 9, 2015","true","2.4"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

Many different events will happen as time progresses and depending on what skills you chose to focus on, you will either open up new story paths or in some cases even end up dead.  There are many different ways to die, some very unexpected.\n\nReplay value comes from going back and trying to see the different endings (or the different ways to die – yep, I’m still working on that achievement), or even the different story options.  You can save any time you want and the game also includes an auto-save so  you can go back some to try different strategies.  Many times though you will want to start over again fresh, picking different skills just to see what happens.\n\nIf you prefer action based or shooter type games, look elsewhere.

My first reaction was : "Was that it ?" then I checked the wikia, and no it isn't at all. There are quite a few events that can add some unsuspected plot points, but their requirements are ridiculously arbitrary - in one of them, you'll only survive if your "Decoration" skill is high enough. I'm not making that up. And as Chiquihuite said, some skills that should logically be useful and even vital like horse riding are never used.\n\nOverall, the skill requirements for each situation (Do you know who this man is ? Can you intimidate/flatter him ? Can you climb this wall ? Can you play harp ? Can you notice this food is poisoned ? Can you lead a war ship ?) are so high, and the learning sessions so few that you have to choose what skills to max and miss 80% of the rest. You want to become a magic expert ? You'll get betrayed by nobles because you don't have any time to learn Court Manners and Internal Affairs. You try to learn both anyway ? Then you'll die because you didn't upgrade the running/reflexes/poison knowledge that would have allowed you to survive that assassination attempt.\n\nThe "basic" way to play (survive 40 days) isn't really interesting after the first success, and exploring all paths is impossible unless you follow a detailed walkthrough and manage your skills on an Excel graph to not put a single one unused. Neither of these is fun for me, so I can't recommand this game.","December 29, 2013","false","7.5"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","31","43","0","0"

Of course, that would be the perfect title if she's using a cloning machine...\n\nFun Facts:\n\n1. There's a dangerous weapon in this game that can kill Elodie, no matter how well she can pwn everybody. It's immune to magic and is basically a one-kill wonder, especially after the little princess tidies up a withering plant once her =Decoration is high enough. Yes that's right, it's a freaking basket of chocolate. Man, even Hershey's want Elodie dead.\n\n2. Despite looking flashy, discs of light don't do ♥♥♥♥ against armor.\n\n3. This game is what happens when George R. R. Martin tries to turn Madoka Kaname into a princess.\n\n4. Chuck Norris isn't in this game for if he was, Elodie's death would've already been part of the backstory.\n\n5. No matter how stupid or how much of a ♥♥♥♥-ing idiot you are,  pushing arrows deeper into your flesh is never a great substitute for proper first aid! That is, unless you're a masochistic suicide.\n\n6. Contrary to popular belief, not all princesses are immortal. DAMN YOU DISNEY FOR PUTTING THAT 'HAPPILY EVER AFTER' BULLCRAP INTO OUR HEADS!!!!\n\n7. There's a way to command the tentacled sea monster to appear: First max out the Wield Magic stat. Afterwards, grab at least three/ four of your Lumen friends to help you out so that you won't turn into Nova's very first (unintentional) suicide bomber. Finally, when the enemy fleet comes within range, yell out "RELEASE THE KRAKEN!" and wipe out the unlucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Of course, the tentacled monster is a jerk ♥♥♥ when it comes to arriving on time (he do have to finish watching his favorite shows after all) so he'll come by the next day. Of course, he'll be very hungry and will start snacking on your sailors so you have three options: trap him in a magical seal despite the fact that you wanted him to appear in the first place, offer yourself as his next meal and be broken down into nutrients for his huge body (I wonder how many calories does a 14 year old human girl have anyway), or toss your (unwilling) cousin into his maw instead. Of course, if you chose the third option, your auntie had better be dead beforehand or she'll show you the true meaning of being 'as stiff as a board'...\n\nOf course, there should be the fourth option of feeding Mr. Kraken chocolate but that would make the game too easy, eh?\n\n8. If your Flattery stat is too low, you can insult your future mother-in-law's... assets, which will quickly backfire...\n\n9. This game manages to make dying look cute.\n\n10. (All) Most of your family/nobles want you dead. Nuff said. Even the peasants want to see what sort of 'candy' they can get from beating the hell out of an Elodie-shaped pinata if you don't treat them right.\n\n11' Even the monsters want you dead for some reason. Maybe your hair remind them of that pink frosting that gave them diarrhea at that last monster party or maybe you'd just unknowingly called them ugly. In either case, don't touch those slimy tentacles with your bare hands. That stuff is anything but sweat. Alternatively, you can let the monster grab your friend and hightail it out of there. Sure her mom would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you're about to be Queen and she is not. Only the strongest will survive.\n\n12. This is one of those games that make you want to plow your fist through the monitor. Please don't do it: computers are expensive these days. Just because you play as a princess doesn't mean you're as rich as one.\n\n13. You can become the enemy Lumen's evil minion if you're ruthless enough, Cue the evil theme song.\n\n14. It takes guts even for a 14 year old girl to push forward to become Queen, no matter how many times you die. Not even the toughest and most manly characters can touch Elodie's dedication. They all may have fancy guns and shiny swords, but Elodie has her dedication, her skills, and around 1 month of replayed games.\n\nMy verdict- 2,000,000 deaths/100 lives\nYoungest-Female-Character-To-Die-Too-Many-Times-In-Her-Repeated-Attempts-To-Become-Queen Simulator 2013","March 13, 2015","true","10.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","89","17","19","15","0"

It's frilly, it's girly, it's not your tipical action RPG. Well listen up boys, cause this ain't any sort of namby-pamby walk in the park.\n\nBefore you punch a wall to regain your manliness that you feel has dropped by even looking into this game, you should know something. If you're into judging a book by it's cover, you might be turned off by Long Live The Queen's anime-esque art style or it's female protaganist - you don't know how wrong you are.\n\nLLTQ is a text based RPG that puts you in the shoes of Elodie, Queen of Nova. Or, should I say, almost queen; tough luck buddy, you've got 40 weeks to survive before you get that far.\n\nOh, I know what you're thinking. '40 Weeks? Like three months? Ha. I'll finish that, play some Dota, AND punch a wall to get back my manliness card.' YEAH NO. You're dealing with assassins, monsters, rebellions, a set of pissy (read: deadly) relatives, and an entire kingdom looking at you to fix it. Or not, you know. They could always just kill you - I'm sure that'd fix the problem. Somehow.\n\nAnd here you're saying WOAH, HOLD UP. I've seen this before! You won't get me with your cutesy violence and your lack of guns!\n\nListen up, son. You can be impaled, exploded, imploded, poisoned, drained, and, in one unfortunate ending, eaten.

This game just goes to show how unfit a queen I would be if the role were forced upon me.\nCutthroat politics, aristocratic relationships, exciting celebrations, brutal war, and even magic come into play when you're on the road to queendom.\n\nThis game plays sort of like a visual novel.  Playing as princess Elodie, you take weekly "classes" that improve her various skills, such as court manners, public speaking, dance, swordsmanship, falcon handling, history, internal affairs, divination, and more.  Elodie also has a mood meter of 4 attributes: angry/fearful, cheerful/depressed, willful/yielding, and pressured/lonely.  Depending on what her mood is for each skill category you potentially increase can be affected by a bonus/penalty that influences the rate of learning for that particular skillset.  Each skill you improve will ultimately decide Elodie's fate- there is a failure/partial success/success rating that ensues when an event occurs and depending on what you get, the outcome of the game will be based on these failures or successes.  Be warned!  You *will* die at least once in this game, but don't worry- you can start over from an earlier time or from the beginning, ensuring you have the right knowledge/skills to get through a major event.\n\nYou also get the opportunity to dress the princess up in various outfits when you improve categorized skills to a certain extent.  Examples include a tutu, catsuit, military regalia, and even magical girl.  Totally adorbs.\n\nMusic's decent.  It is fitting for the subject matter.\n\nIn short:\nStory: 4/5\nMusic: 3.5/5\nReplayability: yes/5\nArt: Anything on steam is infinitely better than what I can draw/5\n\nPS: Usually if I write > 1 sentence for a recommendation that means I *highly* recommend the game.

Not wanting to wake her, you leave your left\nhand holding her shoulders as you reach for your\nlaptop to play a game, unable to go back to sleep.\n\nYou realize there's a game you haven't touched,\nhaving bought it when it first came out and it was on\noffer. You had to keep it from Ms. Novocaine then, for\nshe was already disliking anime and manga when you\nstill loved it then. You blink at the clock which reads\n2.35AM. Shrugging, you open a game of sakura pink\nand frilly death.\n\nLONG LIVE THE QUEEN.\n\nYou begin with playing the beautiful (jailbait) Princess\nElodie, a would-be-queen of the Kingdom of Nova. As\nthe story unfolds, magic has been outlawed (go figure)\nand you have to make sure Elodie is prepped and ready\nto rule as Queen in 40 weeks!\n\nYou blink again in disbelief. "Wait... what?!" You gasp,\nrealizing you're on an indirect timer. "40 weeks is...\n40 turns?!" You realize that you're supposed to keep\nElodie not just alive, but sufficiently skilled in any\nnumbers of methods and paths available as there are\nBarons out to usurp her, kill her, marry her or make\nbloody war upon her Kingdom. Sometimes, they want\nto do all four!\n\nAs you take a magically-inclined path to develop Elodie,\nyou glance at the achievements available. The primary\ncore of the game's driving force is even more horrifying,\nas the game encourages you to find the different ways\nthat Elodie can DIE. Your eyes widen as you return to\nthe glitzy, pastel-colored 2D world. The themes are so\njarring and you find yourself uttering over and over the\nsame words; "-what kind of game is this?!"\n\n"Hmmn? What kind of game you playing?" Summer-Rain\nmutters, awoken by the music-box-like tunes coming\nfrom the game and your incredulous exclamations. You\nsoftly greet her as she stirs and explain your predicament\nas to who would create a game to discover the myriad\nways to murder a 12-year-old Princess.\n\nSummer-Rain squints for awhile, then curls up into a ball\nnext to you and looks at your next move through half-open\neyes. She draws the blanket over the both you best as you\ncan. "Starboy?" Summer-Rain muses, as you load the game\nagain after feeding Elodie to monsters in the forest.\n\n"Yes...?" You look towards her, her face bathed in the pink\nreflections of the game. Summer-Rain smiles that signature\nsmile of hers, eyes closing. "Thank you. I was afraid you\nwould go back to her... I would have understood, but that\nwould have hurt me. Thank you... thank you so much."\n\nSummer-Rain says the words with such sincerity that you\nfind yourself moved more than usual by her. You also\ncannot help but think you dodged a huge bullet by being\nwith her rather than Ms. Novocaine, not unlike how you\nsteer Elodie clear from danger. Ms. Novocaine trying to\nreturn at a strange time when things are going well for\nyou... also makes you wonder if your life and Elodie's\nown are... not dissimilar to the other.\n\n"You're very much welcome. Summer." You respond,\nafter carefully choosing your words, just like you would\nfor Elodie to maintain a clear outcome. Although it was\nnot necessary, you elect caution more and more after\nyou've been playing Long Live the Queen, and that in\nitself, has been a story about learning how to get what\nyou want, but at the same time, there are some things\nthat need to be broken, or left behind.\n\nSometimes both.\n\n"Happy Valentine's day, Summer." You kiss her cheek,\nand she beams absent-mindedly. "Oh yeah...!" She\nstarts, slowly grinning. "It IS Valentine's today...!"\n\nYou realize that Long Live the Queen is both the story\nof Summer-Rain and even Ms. Novocaine, the story, or\nlife of a girl thrust out of her comfort zone, into the big\nhostile world out for everything. You realize why, to\nsome tiny degree why Ms. Novocaine might have left,\nfor a better future for herself, even if that future was\nnothing but a lie. Is that why she wanted to return?\n\nDid she really think that her knight in shining armor\nwould wait for her?\n\nYou embrace Summer-Rain and return her kisses.\n\nYour ship has sailed Ms. Novocaine. "Sayonara,\nSenorita." You think to yourself, smiling slightly.\nSummer-Rain notices. "What's so funny?" She asks.\n\n"Nothing at all, my Queen. Long may you reign."\nYou hold her tightly, both of you hugging each other\nas if there was no tomorrow. "Happy Valentine's day.\nI love you, Summer." You can feel the warmth of her\nsmile. "Love you too, Starboy. Happy Valentine's day."\n\nLONG LIVE THE QUEEN.\n\n\n","February 14","true","9.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","13","14","8","0"

Long story short: you are going to die. A lot. No, seriously, this game aims to kill you in ways that make you groan in frustration or facepalm at dearest Elodie's stupidity.\n\nNonetheless, Long Live the Queen is a lot of fun to play and, no matter how often (or *how*, because there are a variety of ways) you die, you'll find yourself restarting the game from the very beginning, where you find our that your mother has recently died, leaving you to become queen should you survive one full harrowing year full of assassination attempts, scandal, accidents, and shaking your fist angrily at your computer screen, and playing through yet again. And again. And again. Every time you get just a bit further than the last time you died, you get that fabulous sense of accomplishment that keeps you hooked.\n\nThere are a huge number of skills to learn (after all, a princess is more than just a pretty face) and every investment affects how the game will play out. Taking classes and choosing how you spend the weekend after changes Elodie's disposition and also the options that become available to you through the game, whether it be an economic decision that drains the royal coffers or a chance to attend a fancy party in the next castle over. They also change the people you'll meet--possible suitors or powerful allies/enemies. Decisions, decisions, decisions.\n\nThe graphics are cutesy anime style, full of vibrant colours and overly-dramatic expressions and reactions. The story is actually pretty in-depth, with enough depth and intrigue to keep you on your toes, but I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nDefinitely worth the holiday sale 8.99, but if you can get it for even cheaper JUMP ON THAT. Long Live the Queen will frustrate the hell out of you, but it will also grow near and dear to your heart.","December 31, 2013","true","3.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

This game is incredibly addictive, in all the right ways. The game is also incredibly deep. I found myself failing the game, replaying, and having an entirely different and new experience. The great thing, though, is that it's very, very, very hard to "see the strings". I couldn't easily deduce a way to "game" the system to ensure a win; the game's mechanics are so deep, convoluted and fantastic that every choice was a mystery.\n\nI had a hell of a lot of fun with this game. I played for 8 hours before managing to complete it, and even then there were sides to the game I didn't experience.\n\nYou may look at this game and see a silly game about an anime girl, but it's so much more than that. The characters are deep and interesting, the relationships sprawling and complicated, and the choices varied and important. Everything you do matters. Gamers who enjoy games such as Deus Ex, Alpha Protocol, The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us and others will get a real kick out of the freedom of choice your character has, and the reprocussions this can cause.\n\nA fantastic title.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lickbrains/recommended/251990/","lickbrains","Junebug #1376","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lickbrains/","281 products in account","First and foremost, SAVE OFTEN. I recommend creating multiple saves at different points of the game while you're successful because you will die. Long Live The Queen is a visual novel of sorts with an interesting concept. You're Elodie, a princess learning to be queen. You gotta start from scratch and take two classes a week to improve skills. Sounds good but the "strategy" required in this game is a little bit shallow.\n\nMood, no matter how good or bad, influences how effective Elodie will be at learning a skill. Sounds legit, right? I thought that, because there was a Mood meter, you wanted to get her to the top of each meter (ex: Cheerful vs Depressed) so that she could function at full capacity. However, no matter how negative or positive the mood is, both will benefit Elodie in learning certain skills the other mood won't allow improvement for. Everything you pick has a ripple effect.\n\nDoesn't sound so bad, yeah? What makes this a ridiculous mechanic is that there's no way of predicting what mood will affect skills you might need for upcoming events. Every action has consequences; you have to try to control every aspect and memorize events that are going to happen as they occur if you want Elodie to live. The events are always the same every gameplay so that helps in "predicting" what's going to happen. After a while, having to click through the dialogue for the 20th time gets repetitive. Failing to learn skills and performing poorly too often will ultimately result in death no matter what. If it doesn't affect Elodie now, it will later.\n\nI'd recommend this game for the art alone but I like a lot of magical girl-type things. If you're bad at memorizing and don't like Sailor Moon-type stories or have a fear of femininity, this game isn't for you. Would I say it's $10 worth of fun? Meh, I wouldn't pay it for what it offers but your miles may vary. Long Live The Queen contains a nice art style, some whimsy (squids lel), barely-there mechanics (with plenty of room for improvement), and an adequately written (grammar-wise) feel good tale we've heard before...if you live long enough.\n\n5.5/10","December 30, 2013","true","5.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","1"

It will have you balancing politics, war, public safety, and your own life. And if any fall out of balance, expect bad things to happen. From riots/rebellions, to assassination attempts.

If you REALLY want a game like this, stick with Princess Maker 2.  This just feels like they tried too hard.  Granted, there are ideas that I love in here like customizing the girl's attire and just being a badass Magical Girl.  The clothing that you can have with her is pretty cool...some....ehhhhhh....really shouldn't have been implemented.  Made me feel awkward with a few outfits for a little girl.\nSpeaking of, unless I didn't get a true ending after defeating a certain someone as a magical girl, I kinda missed the aging of the young future queen.  I also felt the lack of adventure was there as well.  In Princess Maker 2, you had the young one go off on her on and explore certain areas, gain certain items, and all that fun stuff.  Here, it's just a confinement.\nThe one thing I liked was the fact of doing certain things to make her happy, sad, angry or just lonely.  Doing certain things in the castle will effect your little future queen and that was interesting.\nHowever, I felt that this was just lackluster.  There are so many things to boost up in this game, and you just can't tell how much or how many traits you need to progress in the story.  It will take a few tries to get the hang of it, but even then, you just don't know what you truly need.  I say this because, the story will progress rather quickly and with lack of certain traits, your future queen will fail in most aspects, making you a little angry.\nMy boyfriend even played this game and he was a little angry at the game.  He loved the concept, but, only if it was executed well.  I know he too recommends Princess Maker 2, where he made her into the finest blood-thirsty warrior of her time.","December 16, 2013","false","4.4"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","30","49","0","1"

So yeah being a loli queen is a hard task.\n\nAt first	  I have thought this game is a fashion simulator for girls but I was wrong. Its a really mature game with a lot of decision making , and hey decisions in this game actually matter, fate of the kingdom lays at your hands. ( me3 go and die in hell )\n\nThere is a huge skill tree list  that allows you to play the way you want, of course time is limited so you won't get everything maxed. You have to choose carefully what skills are you improving, and every skill affect the game outcome in a different way. You can be a leader with a strong presence, a strategist , skilled swordmaster, animal lover, qt magician girl , diplomat or trading master.\nEvery skill has its bonuses in the game, if you are good at accounting you will have more chances to improve your kingdom resources. If you are military general you can lead battles by yourself and improve your chances at winning and reduce losses, learning world history will give you more information around your enemies or past events.\nBeing a master at intrugue also helps you to detect any silent threats from your nobles, and it might even prevent a raise of the rebellion.\n\nThe best part  of it is that every stat is usefull and many of them can be mixed to achieve interesting results. A strategy + Battlefield medicine might yield a sweet results. But its only one of the many possible pairings.\n\nAlternatively  you can be a cruel loli and slain everyone/everyone on its way with no remorse.\n\nThere is few/several? endings. I haven't get to each one but some of them were really surpsing. Game lenght is around few hours but it has a  [/b]huge replayabillity value [/b] , especially if you want to know each ending or try different choices.\n\nAll you have to do is to make it to the coronation to became a true Queen, but there are many enemies around.\n\nEspecially chocolates.","March 1, 2015","true","9.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","10","12","5","4"

You train skills with classes and events to prevent your own death until you make it to your 15th birthday and are crowned the Queen. It's very easy to get killed and you will likely do so a couple of times before you success, unless you are lucky.\n\nYou decide how conflicts plan out based on your knowledge in fields, so if you focus on one class of skills, you will be doomed when another is needed for something. Your mother's recent death makes you sad at the beginning, but you can change your mood which in turn affects your class performance. If you do specific events you can unlock magic, which is great and all, but if you don't want to go down that path you don't need to do that, which is fantastic.\n\nYou can win by making others too afraid to attack you with your presence, have such defenses that assassins fail in their attempt, or magically detect and eliminate someone with your own preference of killing technique. This game is most certainly NOT FOR EVERYONE, but if you like simulation where your choices can branch out into a story and the theme of being the Queen of a magical fantasy world, then pick this game up when you can!","January 1, 2014","true","14.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

There's not much you can say beyond that to really describe the game: you invest in skills, make decisions and hope that when a skill check comes up you can pass and if you fail, hope it is not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t fatal check.\n\nOutside of the usual grumbling that it is anime as ♥♥♥♥, a common complaint is that the game is too easy and reaching your coronation is not particularly difficult (there's one obscenely obvious path to winning). The real fun is finding all of the alternative events, conversations and side stories in an attempt to collect all the deaths, epilogues and achievements. Want to win a naval battle? Marry a commoner? Join up with the evil guys? Save the day with singing?! All are possible, but you have to invest in the right skills to set off the correct event flags to just get them in motion.\n\nIf you're looking for a game to add to your completion list then you won't get much out of LLTQ except a laugh or two, but if you like exploring weird skill combinations and reloading save after save because you got ♥♥♥♥ed over by a completely random skill check you weren't expecting, you can definitely get a reasonable amount of entertainment and accomplishment out of this game.","June 29, 2014","true","6.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Basically it's like a choose your own adventure novel, with many, many ways to die. Essentially you are playing through a linear story, and you are given different skills to master and choices to make in order to get to one of the multiple endings.\n\nThe game itself is completely sound, I have not run into any glitches or anything of that sort. I personally like the art style, and the music serves its purpose. I believe the music could be a bit more varied througout, but that isn't a huge complaint. Now as far as the gameplay goes, it's pretty much just point and click. There isn't much to go over in that regard. One thing that is worth bringing up is that this is a linear game. While there are different outcomes, the path you take is virtually the same. It's important to note this before you purchase, or you may be dissapointed.\n\nTo conclude, I think this is worth the five dollars I spent on it. It's a fun game with no technical flaws that I can think of, and I got what I paid for.

Train some skills and see how they influence the outcome. At first it feels like a roguelike of some kind. Unfortunately when you fail and die and replay the game you find out that everything is exactly the same and - save for the outcome of some events depending on your skill. There is no randomization at all. Hence, the game is not very replayable, because everything happens the same way until the moment when you failed skillcheck the previous game, because now you know what you need. This forces metagaming, there is no way to get past some events unless you have appropriate skill and - what is worse - very often there is no hint of what skill will be required of you in the future, so you just train everything little by little until you are forced to replay the game, because you lacked a litttle skill in something. And in the end you will need everything anyway, no specialization is good, gotta be jack of all trades!\n\nThe game plays like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Age of Decadence, basically. Albeit fun for about 2 hours (or whenever it is you have to replay it for the third or so time), it quickly becomes very repetitive and boring, silly dialogues do not help. I'd actually recommend it for very very cheap though. I got it for 2.5€ I think and I would still be hesitant to recommend the game for that price, but if it is in a bundle or below 2€ or you just love manga, then go ahead and give it a try. It's actually fun for a short while... just too short of a while.\n\nVery nice artworks and music though.","March 24","false","3.4"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

Of course, this is not any ordinary girl, for she is meant to be the future Queen of her land. You have to help our protagonist with preparing her for potential assassins, cival war, propaganda and foreign affairs by making choices about her education and strategy.\n\nBy dating sim mechanics, I mean that you have to choose which stats to builds up and you learn about possible strategies through failure. In dating sims this means failing to get the love-interest. In Long Live the Queen this means dying. A lot.\n\nYou have multiple save slots. Use them.\n\nThat is the main piece of advice I have to have the most enjoyable experience possible. Otherwise, let yourself go, accept failure as a definite and enjoy a game where you slowly build a strategy over time via hypothesis-testing.\n\nStory-wise, the writing is wonderful. The stats results in numerous dialogue branches, so that you feel like your character is actually changing based on her education and her actions. There's numerous replayability, for you can win (and lose) in many different ways. If you're into Game of Thrones-esque intrigue and royal complications, there's enough to keep you entranced for a while.\n\nOn the whole, I recommend Long Live the Queen for those who don't mind trial-and-error style strategy game play who are looking for a taste of experiencing Dating Sim mechanics without the dating.\n\n(Though, there is some dating.)\n\n","February 10","true","7.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The RPG part involves leveling up the main character (you can upgrade 2 skills per turn), so that she can overcome tests of skill and survive. She'll have to face war, assassination attempts, duels (both physical and magical) and other perils. During these ordeals, her mood will swing, and each of the 10 moods I discovered so far (apart from the 8 basics, I managed to be Neutral and Injured) will give you bonuses and penalties.\n\nI reached my first positive game ending after 8 playthroughs. Each time I died, I learned a new test I had to overcome, so I'd concentrate on the necessary skills. Some of the dangers you can divert by the choices you make (I was a little too much headstrong for my own good, repeatedly exposing myself to trouble, thinking I was leveled up enough), but others are mandatory for your storyline to progress. I'm glad I never felt frustrated and resorted to a walkthrough; instead, I started making notes and planning my character development.\n\nWhen I finally won, after a little more than 13 hours of playing, I was a little perplexed, because I thought the game would be longer. Also, I got only 10 of the 45 achievements, so it's clear that the story has way more unexplored branches!

T_T\nFinding all the ways Elodie can die is almost as much fun as figuring out how to make her an effective queen, actually, and is one of the achievements!\nAlso, for the badge hunters out there, this game has trading cards!\nI recommend this game if you like highly detail-oriented games, like D&D 3rd edition and whatnot... if you're like me and find making the characters in it the most fun part, anyways.  It's pretty much creating a character sheet if the character creation was on steroids, with the rest of the game as a sidenote.  =^_^=\nIf you're worried about achievements, don't worry at all!  There are guides that will give you all of the achievements, right on steam.  Only downside is that you will have to replay the game a TON for 100% achievements (if you consider that a downside.  Some will, but I'm sitting on the fence about it).  Good news is that each playthrough doesn't take too terribly long, being 40 weeks/turns at the longest (1 turn/week = 1 set of 2 lessons, 1 castle activity, and whatever cutscene decisions for that week)","May 20","true","12.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Playing the game and going through the different story possibilities was enjoyable. Though it is all text/static image based, so it may not be for everyone. The game was definitely worth playing.\n\nThe storyline has a lot of very different events that can be played through. Personally I have seven hours of gameplay, but only 38% of achivements, which would refelct that I haven't even gone through 50% of the possible choices. There is just a lot to this game.\n\nThe one thing I can think of that I can say could have been better is the skill/stats training system. On a "weekly" basis you choose which classes to pick, and the stats effect the choices you can make, and situations you can deal with. So to find all the possible story aspects of the game a player would have to go through a lot of different play throughs with different stats. I find the system can be a bit boring, and uncertain. It does give an enjoyable puzzle aspect to the story, but I would have prefered a more connected choice system that effected stats. Rather than simply choosing a class.\n\nOverall, the immensiveness of the storyline and large number of possibilities was very enjoyable. The humour of certain events, such as chocolates *cough*, was very entertaining. If you enjoy reading, and choose your own adventure games its very much worth buying and playing.\n","February 9, 2014","true","9.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesskitten/recommended/251990/","jesskitten","Shiara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesskitten/","1888 products in account","LLTQ is a life-simulation/RPG game where you control a fledgling princess in a land rife with danger, and seek to train her skills and keep her alive until her coronation as Queen in 40 weeks. The characters and lore are well-written, and while at first the anime graphics and simple weekly events recap may lull you into a sense of security (no news is good news?), you soon realise, possibly after your first untimely death, that there are several hidden subplots lurking beneath the surface, and you have to account for them in future playthroughs or die horribly, again.\n\nThese sorts of games differ from graphic novel games in that there is always a progression of in-game time between turns, and most game decisions, and what options you have, are strongly based upon what kind of skills you have trained up till that point.\n\nEach game turn (which represents a full week) takes the following format:\n\n1. You get to choose her outfit (if any) -- they're unlocked by training skills to a certain point, and boost all skill checks (but not training) in that skill group for the rest of the week.\n\n2. You get to choose two classes for her to take, which improve two of her skills by a certain amount. That amount is modified by any bonuses/penalties to that skill group for the week, which come from her prior knowledge already invested in that skill group, as well as modifiers from her dominant mood.\n\n3. You then get a story phase, where every week the "main plotline" of the game continues, events occur and resolve, and your character does a bunch of skill checks and often picks an option or two in order to influence the outcome of the story. They are interconnected, so many events early on will influence things later. There is no randomness in this at all - if you train the exact same skills and pick the exact same options in two separate games, events will unfold in the exact same manner both times.\n\n4. You then get a weekend phase, where you can pick one of various activities for her to spent her weekend at, to influence her mood. This phase is VERY important because once you figure out how the moods affect the skill bonuses/penalties, you will want to carefully balance her moods, mostly done via these weekend phases, in order to give her the right dominant mood for next week's training. There can be some story events that occur here as well, if you pick specially marked activities that may appear.\n\nAnd then it repeats again, 39 more times, at the end of which you are crowned Queen (if you survive that long).\n\nBecause the game progresses in weekly instead of daily chunks, I found the game to be much shorter than others of its ilk, my first successful ending was disappointing because my initial reaction was "Nooo! That's it?! I want to see what happens to her next! She's just starting to come into her own and be a force to be reckoned with! I love her! Let me continue the story! Wah. :("\n\nA lot of the depth of the game is in its side paths, and the branches you can take to successfully reach the end, rather than the length of the story and the actual success or failure. Even now that I know how the story ends, and I am at least dimly aware of all the subplots and what they lead to, I still want to see if I can take her through them at some point to view the story from those perspectives.\n\nOn the other hand, since each iteration of the game is so short, it actually has a bit of a rogue-like aspect to it, where you learn a little bit more each time you die (or win), and although you have to start over, it doesn't take all that long to get back to where you were before.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 7.5:\n---\nGraphics (0-2): 1.5\nIt's typical anime graphics and I didn't enjoy that, though I didn't detest it either. However, some of the outfits she gets to wear are decidedly un-queenly and unrealistic. The graphics are static cardboards too, but that is the standard in life sim games and thus acceptable. She gets a different look for each of her 9 possible dominant moods, which was a nice touch.\n\nMusic (0-2): 1.5\nThe music seemed repetitive, but never got annoying. Also standard for life-sim games. A few more tracks would have been nice, though.\n\nStory (0-2): 1.5\nThe story is awesome, and touching, especially since you can never see the entire story at once. The secret subplots going on in the background are very interesting when you realise their existence and look at them after a couple runs. There are little lore snippets written up for all the skills, for every 10 points you gain in each. You feel very connected to your character, and you feel yourself growing with her. There are lots of little awesome moments that don't influence the plot, but that your character can unlock by passing a skill check at a certain point anyway.\n\nHowever! It is linear, comes to an abrupt end, and lacks much replayability. You can play your character a different way, to see a different path or outcome, but it still goes through the same series of events and you know how it's going to end each time. Not all life sim games run like that. I would have liked this scripted part of the story to be the first half of the game, with a second half dealing with after you become Queen where you have to deal with politics and events and manage your kingdom.\n\nGameplay (0-2): 1\nIt really, reeeeeally needs to be longer. There are games with similar sideways depth and branching options that also go on for much longer. At the least, break the weeks up into smaller chunks, and insert minor random events and evening activities in between. Time feels like it flies by and then is over too soon. Yes that lends itself to a rogue-like feel, but I don't think it's the best fit. There aren't enough opportunities to use many of the skills, and there is no reason to train many of them past a certain (unknown) point, or at all, because there are only one or two checks for that skill through the game, and often ones you can easily bypass anyway.\n\nUI (0-2): 2\nIt's mouse-based, simple to navigate, and had nothing annoying about it. There is a clean save/load system as well. Mild problems include that the button to progress time was a small button on one screen and there's nothing on the main UI that points you to it before you know where it is. Also, the panels could be a bit more interconnected, I also often found myself wanting to look at my skills screen during the weekend phase, which is impossible.\n---\n\nLife sims are one of my favourite types of genres, and while I wouldn't consider this game the best one I've ever played (Academagia takes that cake as of now), it definitely ranks up there. In a sense, these life sim games are a digital evolution of the gamebook genre in the 90s and early 00s, similar to Lone Wolf, Fighting Fantasy, Fabled Lands, Tunnels and Trolls etc.\n\nAnd between them, LLTQ matches up to Fighting Fantasy the best - something you won't complete on your first try, due to eclectic/unfair skill combinations/choices needed to complete a path, with some rather extravagant skill checks, skills that are only used once or twice anywhere in the story, and all in all a linear plot even though you have several ways to get there, but still a good read overall.\n\n(PS: For anyone wondering about Academagia, it is here[www.academagia.com]. It is awesome, long and packs such a powerful punch at the end that I hate them for not completing Year 2 as of this writing. It isn't on Steam, though, or even Greenlight, yet, because the devs have another nice game on Greenlight that hasn't taken off either. They unfortunately don't really know how to market themselves very well. That other game is Scheheraraze, and is on Steam Greenlight. Also an excellent life sim/RPG. Go vote for it! More life sim games on Steam please. :) )\n\nThanks for reading!","December 30, 2013","true","4.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","4"

Each time you walk into one, you have attained the dubious ability to avoid it on your next trip through the labyrinth. That, basically, is what playing "Long Live the Queen" is like. Or actually, it's even worse than that. Since knowing where a trap is and how to avoid it are two different things. But once you've figured out one of the ways of surviving a trap, you'll have to perform it (in terms of getting certain stats high enough in time) every time you replay the game. The developer actually prides him/herself that there is that there are actually two or three ways to survive a trap (scripted event) out of the circa 30 different stat bars this game sports. Injustifiably so, in my opinion, since this still leaves numerous trial & error runs until the player has found one of the solutions.\n\nSurely the option to save your game means that you won't have to replay every single event time and again? Well, only in so far as you haven't blown any of the other choices for maxing the proper stat-bars needed for other events that will be coming soon. And you'll have to write down all the choices you've made up to the moment you saved your game. For *every* savegame, or else there is no real point in saving any of your games.\n\nSo basically, your princess character gets to die. A lot. Which is illustrated with slightly comical visuals.\n\nDoes all of that stat-maxing, route-mapping, savegame-documenting and dying over and over again sound like fun to you?

In a way, it sort of is. However, despite the fact that it looks like an incredibly girly visual novel, it is an insanely difficult/complicated strategy game that is actually pretty worth the price. It has wonderful replayability value as you go through and try to unlock different things or get different endings. By different endings, it's better to say "different ways to die because you can't pass your skill checks." There are a couple of "non-death" endings, but they're... tricky to get. Even then, those different endings have even more variety (or some of them do anyway) depending on different happenings leading up to them that didn't affect the overall ending.\n\nIt's simple and casual at first glance, but when you actually try to play it, EVERYTHING WANTS YOU DEAD.\n\nThere are guides out now, yes, but it's still fun to keep playing and trying to come up with better strategies for different options each time.\n\nIf I have one complaint, it's about the magic system called "Lumens" which is kind of hokey. Then again, it fits in with the "magical girl/shoujo visual novel" theme the game wants you to get so I supposed in that context, it's fine. That... and the whole coming of age at 15 and getting married to older men at that age is little bit disconcerting but for the time era the game is set in, that isn't really unusual. It's "safe for work" at any rate.\n\nIf you like raising sims mixed with strategy and political intrigue, you'll probably enjoy this despite the pink sparkles and glitter everywhere.","December 11, 2013","true","12.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/recommended/251990/","fortheussr","chairbender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/","342 products in account","One of the appealing aspects of visual novels, for some people, is "mastering" the mechanics: Learning the flags, checks, etc... and using that mastery to obtain an outcome you desire. It's the same sort of engagement you might get from a puzzle game. I think that this game focuses on emphasizing that aspect of enjoyment. The reward for being able to reach new branches of the story is getting to see what happens, and the writing and art is certainly good enough (for me) to make that worthwhile.\n\nWhen you first play this game a few times, it's just interesting to see what happens based on the choices you make. Eventually, though, you may find yourself more interested in trying to get to the end, and that's where the gameplay changes.\n\nWhen I first saw this game, I thought that the events that happened to your character each day were just random, so you wouldn't be able to plan your classes very strategically. Well, I was wrong. As far as I can tell, each "week" of the game always has the same event, but what actually happens may change entirely based on what has happened on previous days. So, there's enough stability to give you the ability to strategize.\n\nAt this level of play, the game involves a lot of saving and loading as you explore different choices and different classes. The game seems designed with this in mind: saving and loading is really quick. At any point you can right click to bring up the save/load screen. I never found myself getting frustrated by going back and reloading a save. The game makes it easy to remember what you did in each save by including the week you were on and letting you name the save. It also lets you quickly skip through dialogue you've already seen.\n\nIf you like visual novels you'll probably really enjoy this game.","April 6, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Upgrading her skills (by visiting different areas of the castle grounds and learning from many different teachers) can change the outcomes of several events interspersed throughout the game in your favor and leveling up enough can even unlock special clothing that boosts your stats in particular areas.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/recommended/251990/","cannonesshannah","Katie's Hannah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/","979 products in account","I'm not usually one drawn to the anime aesthetic so I approached this game with some skepticism.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the game, while not flawless, really does what it sets out to do well.  It has a good visual design, things are presented quite well and the music while limited and therefore repetitive fits the theme well and adds to the game.  In short given the very few people involved the production values of the game are pretty high.  It easily comes up to the same standards as competing Japaneese games in the same vein that have entire studios behind them.\n\nProbably the one thing that I was leery about knowing the tendancies of anime was how quickly things could get odd at best, but I found both romance and other parts of the game were done quite tastefully. I'll leave specific example out of this brief review as otherwise it would be the kind of spoilers that would get me spat on in the street, but it's kept quite clean.\n\nThe game handles essentially as most other choose-your-own-adventure type games, also called life sims, you choose your actions for the given game week, and then react to the events of that week.  In this particular game's case, you choose which classes to take in a week, getting to essentially chose two skills to improve.  Those skills then get used to get through the events during the week.\n\nProbably what I like the most about the game in this regards is that you can fail a good majority of these events and the various checks, and still get through the game.  Many events have many different skills which can be applied to the resolution, which means you can get through situations in a variety of ways.  This makes the game not just a  slog through a linear progression, but rather a true choose-your-own-adventure game.   Choices can and do have meaningful consequences, and how things turn out can vary dramatically given how you handle given events.  What I appreciated a lot, because you do not see it very often if at all in modern gaming, is that sometimes events which may have seemed like a failure or a bad/cruel/needless thing to do at the time can actually help you in the future.\n\nAnother thing that helps the game along is the implementation of the surprisingly rare in modern times classical save system.  While the arguement rages about save-scumming to this day, the fact is that it remains a matter of personal choice whether to use saves in that matter and the ability to not be completely screwed if you make a bad choice and have to replay the whole game over does keep the frustration factor down.\n\nThe length of the game is another asset.  It lasts just long enough to be fun and relate the story, without feeling drawn out or otherwise overstaying its welcome.\n\nIf I had any criticism of the game it is that the game interface is a little clunky.  There's essentially three main screen - managing skills, moods, and lessons, and I feel you probably could have combined these screens and saved a lot of needless switching back and forth.  The game doesn't relate that information in the most efficient and effective way, and you'll be constantly switching back and forth to check what mood your in, how it affects your skills, and so forth.  This is to say nothing of the costumes added later, though that one probably is justified in being a seperate screen.\n\nAll in all, it's not a genre-buster or something, but it's a good story that is well-told, combined with a good game competently made.  It's not a shining star, more an efficient and well-made piece of machinery that perhaps will go underappreciated, but good nonetheless.  Worth playing, especially if you're a fan of the genre, but even if you're not - and by my own admission I really am not - you'll probably find the game worth the price of admission at least.  I know I do.","January 7, 2014","true","17.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Don’t be fooled by the cutesy graphics and initial light heartedness you might feel from it, its a brutal savage man eating simulator.\n\nThe princess needs to manage the kingdom and survive until she becomes queen sound easy enough? It’s really not…\n\nFirst you need to make sure to understand how mood affects how well she can learn certain criteria and it becomes rather difficult at times to decide which is the right way to swing her mood. At times it will lead you to wield great benefits in her education in certain skills like wall climbing or singing that you wanted to invest in at other times… you will give yourself negative bonuses that make the skills unappealing to touch with a stick.\n\nThe skills  you can invest in which will result in successes or fails during events depending on the circumstances, the good news however is that if you fail in one skill for a event another one can make up for it. For example having low composure might lead you to fall, but with fast reflexes you can avoid crashing into someone.\n\nAt times however you will find yourself flustered that none of your skills you spent time on actually helped you out in certain situations and will want to go back to an earlier save to invest points in the required skills  to see how the outcome changes which is why multiple saves can be very helpful in case you need to go back further to achieve a high enough skill.. especially to prevent a death that can occur anywhere in the game\n\nSometimes you are presented even a new option from investing points into skills that would not normally be available otherwise. For example knowing things about trade and mining can open up the option to invest in certain prospects presented to you.\n\nOnce you understand how to avoid the death flags and finish the game there is a lot of different endings, events, and deaths to be seen and experimented with. It is quite fun to replay the game and think you are better prepared only to be thrown into a new series of events because you invested in other skills.","January 21, 2015","true","6.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HarryCane/recommended/251990/","HarryCane","Harry Cane [NLR]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HarryCane/","198 products in account","A linear experience which always provides fun new outcomes; once you’ve slogged through the opening.\n\nThis game is great, It caught my eye over on GoG and I ended up purchasing the GoG Version- dropping a hour into it (Roughly three play through’s) only to then my friend gifted it to me via steam. Shockingly my achievements carried over into the steam version and I’ve since played through it seven more times- with various degrees of success.\nThe goal is the game is simple: Become the queen. No here’s the catch. The game’s core storyline, which isn’t randomized (you should bare this in mind before purchasing) is designed to kill you. The replay ability comes from how you can approach the previously mentioned story and the differient outcomes they provide.\nThink of it as a tree- you start out at the bottom following the trunk upwards- you could do this countless times and nothing would ever change. Then you reach the branches at the top and depending on which one you initially choose follow you’ll end up on ever narrowing branches. All unique in comparison to their counterparts.\nMagic, Cunning, political black mail, Military might, sex appeal- you name it this game will allow you to test them against the situations presented at you- and with each different approach comes a different outcome which changes the later levels of the game drastically.\nDue to this replaying the game is a tad annoying, since you need to work your way past the same old opening “levels” or as the game call’s them: “weeks”. But once you’ve gotten past the first quarter of the year the game opens up into a dynamic rouge like- and I do mean rouge like.\nInsta-deaths are EVERYWHERE, sometimes you receive forewarning off your impending fate and you can make preparations to avoid it. Others you’ll simply die with no input from you. It makes the game frustrating to say the least- but it’s still enjoyable since you can avoid these insta-deaths by not learning certain skills at the start of the game.\nThe art style is beautiful colourful and vibrant. Taking inspirations from Japanese Visual Novels yet with attention to detail you rarely see. The characters display emotions clearly and the different outfits that you unlock (which provide bonuses when worn) are both well executed, with many of the designs being references to Anime & J-RPG tropes. The game also features a minimalist soundtrack composed of Piano pieces, which are elegant if not repetitive. I choose to play this game with the soundtrack disabled personally, so I can play my own selection in the backdrop.\nThe last thing I will is add is that, if you see yourself dropping a lot of time into this game or are already a fan of the old “Princess maker” series – I would recommend you pick up the GoG Version- since that provides you with a free image of the world map, and this serves as a great reminder if you wish to play the game with a political or militarists mind-set. It’s good to know who could attack you, where they attack from and more importantly; where you want to strike.\nThis game lets you unleash the dogs of war on several occasions- even leading your troops into battle!\nOverall it’s a great time killer, something I play in-between working or whilst cooking- and for the cheap price point I would recommend it to almost anyone who enjoys a good fantasy game.","December 12, 2013","true","3.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The problem with this however is that their are many people who stand to gain from her demise and taking over her kingdom so she not only needs to blossom into a woman extremely quickly, she must also remain alive while doing so whch is harder than it sounds with so, so many ways to die just waiting for you.\n\nThe game is a joy to play in large parts due to its simple but great writing. Your character is believable because you dictate how she should behave and the choices have weight to them. If the game just stuck to this formula it would still be a fun game but supernatural elements come into play and while you can choose to be a magical princess you have to keep in mind that time spent learning your magical powers is time taken away from ruling your kingdom and trying to juggle everything perfectly is impossible (the game is purposely designed that way) so you are usually choosing between the lesser evil but do you even care? I mean with everyone out to kill you, aren't you just doing what needs to be done to survive?\n\nYour villagers may not see it that way, so be careful! Nor may the very people you thought you could trust and is that dad with another woman so quickly after mom died?!\n\nThe game can become quite dark and even depressing at times but that is just part of the charm because it is your actions that are causing the other people to react and while it is tempting to appease others you also have to survive as well and lets not forget that your mother just died too, so maybe you don't want to deal with all these pressures right now.\n\nIf I make the game sound difficult it really isn't. You will die but since it is a novel and not an actual living game (IE Civ5) you can eventually die your way to success after you know what to expect. This doesn't mean however that the game loses replay value as it has multiple endings that reflect the actions you took so if you are a completionist, you will find many hours of replay value to be had here.\n\nI heartily recommend this game!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=413760307\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","March 25, 2015","true","2.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","1"

Having never played PM, I'm no expert, but LLtQ is much more story-driven than PM, which is sort of sandboxy. I actually like the narrative aspect, since it allows you to make plans to get around what killed you last time. Of course, by improving one skill you'll have skimped on some other, which may actually prevent you from getting as far as you did last time.\n\nThat said, this is still a terribly amusing game. You can mistreat Elodie horribly, like making her visit her mother's grave constantly and reinforcing the futility of all her efforts. After all, she's gonna die, too. Probably. And messily. But first she'll embarrass herself, perhaps by tripping over her dress at the ball. You could have avoided that by teaching her reflexes or composure, but who needs that when you can study naval strategy?\n\nUh, not that I approve of abusing princesses.

It's also not a creepy pedo game like Princess Maker or something.\n\nIt's heavily centered around what choices you make to manage your mood and what classes you choose to attend to raise your gigantic list of skills. Nearly every event has one or more skill checks, with many giving more than one "correct" skill to pass the event. There are many ways you will end up dead before you become the Queen, and when you finish a game (win or lose) there is an option to output the story and player choices into an html text log, which is really interesting.\n\nThis is a neat game, and if you like managing stats you should pick it up.","December 11, 2013","true","2.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

The problem is that victory in Long Live The Queen is completely luck based, and even if you get near the end then restart, powered by the knowledge of what's to come, you'll still not get all the way through.\n\nThe idea is that you train your stats, while constantly receiving situations (these aren't randomised, though that can be slightly different paths depending on outcomes) that test these stats. If you trained one or two stats high enough, you pass. It might matter, it might not, it might change something in a few turns' time.\n\nBut there's very little give. Even if you die and reload a save from a few turns back, you might train the stat high enough to pass, only to soon die again for not having another stat. So you have load an even earlier save to train both the stats high enough, but then you die earlier because one of the stats you didn't train wasn't high enough. It's a cycle that isn't fun.\n\nThe idea had a lot of potential, but it only works if there are several ways to an ending (early deaths don't count as satisfying endings), which would be based on your personal approach to being a leader. Instead, you just get killed off unless you have certain stats up to certain levels by a certain point in time, without being given any clues.\n\nTo get to the end, you'll likely need to follow a guide to the letter. But then what's the point of playing?","September 25, 2015","false","2.8"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","22","39","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TIZexion/recommended/251990/","TIZexion","[T.I.] Zexion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TIZexion/","159 products in account","Long Live the Queen is not your typical Visual Novel RPG. Rather, I like to refer to it more as a "spoiled-teenage-dress up-monarchy simulator," but in a surprisingly fun and addictive way. Elodie is a 14 year old princess who you must guide over a 40 week in-game period on the road to her coronation ceremony to become Queen once she reaches her 15th birthday. Only problem is...almost everyone else in the other kingdoms wants to see her fail or die before the 40 weeks have passed.\n\nEssentially, each playthrough is inherently unique based on the classes you have Elodie take to progress her skills each week; The classes you assign Elodie and the story's plot progress at a week by week level instead of a day by day format. The amount of progress she makes in each skill every week will depend upon her mood that week and which two skills you decide she should learn at that time (morning and evening class schedule). In order to change her mood from week to week, you must choose certain paths to take in the game, pass or fail in-game events, and/or vary her evening plans each week. Her progress in certain skills and the choices you make each week can mean the difference between life and death for Elodie. One of the beautiful, albeit frustrating, features of the game is that there is no way to make Elodie good at everything. There is a system that almost forces you to actively think through each decision you make, which adds to the complexity of the story and gameplay overall.\n\nThere is a plethora of ways to win and multiple endings as well, many of which have Elodie dying before the coronation ceremony, but every ending is based upon the decisions you made throughout the game 'til that endpoint. However, there are many events that are locked-in which you cannot avoid; this is one of the negative aspects of the game in my opinion as it makes the story seem more linear in progression and not as dynamic. Despite all of this, if Elodie manages to survive to the end she will always be crowned Queen... but what kind of Queen you become, what kind of Kingdom you create in the future, and how you get there exactly depends on your stats and decisions. I cannot reiterate this wonderful facet of decision-making in the game enough (if you cannot tell). Also, the game allows you to see your entire runthrough and the choices you made via textlog whenever you reach an endpoint should you want a recap or printoff of it in detail.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend this game only to players who like visual novels, who are persistent, and are not easily discouraged or rage at their failures, because you WILL fall short in this game numerous times I assure you. Some people have used guides in the past even due to its difficulty to give you an idea of what to expect if you buy it. However, I submit that if you are dedicated to the plot, enjoy struggles only to try again to better yourself, and have plenty of time to put into the game, then you will most likely enjoy it. I know there are mixed feelings about the game, and I have displayed some of those feelings within this review. As such, I give Long Live the Queen a Solid 7.5 or 8 out of 10. While it is very difficult, lengthy, and possesses a somewhat linear plot, the game also has a great story, challenging decision-making aspects, and adaptive gameplay mechanics. Plus, it is always fun to dress her up in various new clothes based on her skill sets. So if you do choose to grab this game, I say to get it while it is on steam sale. Good luck, and hopefully you won't die. Regardless, of if you do-- LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!","March 9, 2014","true","6.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Depending on your choices, her mood affects how quickly she learns in her classes. The gameplay is very similar to games such as The Sims, The Idolmaster and Princess Maker.\n\nUnlike conventional raising sims, there is little time to worry about how to raise a perfect little princess. Angry citizens, rival nobles, neighboring countries, monsters and other dangers lie at every corner. After the first few playthroughs, you soon realize that the game is extremely ruthless and unforgiving - simply staying alive becomes the first priority. In a world where everyone is after your head, can you ensure your princess survives till her coronation?\n\nOverall, I'd describe the game as a cross between Dark Souls and Princess Maker. Highly recommended to those looking for a unique and challenging simulation game.

So it's all flowers and sunshine, right? Wrong. This game is surprisingly brutal in parts and isn't afraid to make your princess die horribly in several places (and give you achievements for it!), as well as letting you dish it out as well (I took someone's head off in a duel, had someone assassinated, and a few executions as well. Fun!). The game is basically entirely made up of reading stuff and making choices on either events or your weekly schooling, which determines your skills that figure into what you can and cannot do. It can actually be difficult to beat, but once you do you probably will have the game figured out and you won't have too much trouble with that afterwards. If it does have replay value, it is to get all the achievements, which are impossible to get in a single playthrough. It will take alot of them...\n\nSo is it worth it? Well it was more interesting than I expected, but it's still less a game and more a choose your own adventure book. If you like that sort of thing, this may be worth looking at. :)","December 31, 2013","true","16.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

My experience in Long Live The Queen was a great time I will remember.\nI started my journey as an unhappy, pink haired, ♥♥♥♥ of a little girl. As I learned more and more about my past I began to play with more and more "toys" and spend time alone in my room. Needless to say when I was asked of marriage, I immediatly accepted, thinking about all that nasty ♥♥♥ sex we would be having. My dad did not approve, but ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥. I do what I want. On my way home I saw him with some bisexual ♥♥♥♥ of a girl. I carelessly commented on her large ♥♥♥♥, promptly being scolded for doing so. After 100 or so failed skill checks that spun me into a fit of rage i've never known before in my life. I got invited to a birthday party for some little ♥♥♥♥♥ who lived across Nova. Thinking over the possible dangers, I saw no reason to not go to her party. So after a few days of meaninglessly managing my ♥♥♥♥'s fragile little emotions and classes, I began on my way to my friends party. On the way there some really ♥♥♥♥ing loud dramatic music bursted my eardrums as a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥s started attacking me. I passed the reflex check to dodge the arrow, but i failed the archery check. Why do I need an archery check to dodge a ♥♥♥♥ing arrow? I don't ♥♥♥♥ing know. I'm almost positive I don't need to know how to shoot a bow to dodge one. Like seriously. I don't have to have my liscense to not get ♥♥♥♥ing pancaked by a car. It's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. But I digress. After failing some more random ♥♥♥ skill checks. I got shot by an arrow. My little ♥♥♥♥ was impaled on her way to a ♥♥♥♥ing birthday party. Still living (keep in mind I maxed out ♥♥♥♥ing battlefield medicine) I pulled the arrow, only managing to stab myself in some vital organ. WHY THE ♥♥♥♥, IS THERE A STAT FOR BATTLEFIELD MEDICINE, IF I CANT ♥♥♥♥ING GIVE MYSELF MEDICINE, ON THE ♥♥♥♥ING BATTLEFIELD. Overall. ♥♥♥♥ this game. I had fun. But I hated it. It was great. But it makes me want to cut myself constantly. God ♥♥♥♥ me, i'm writing this and I still haven't completed the ♥♥♥♥. Like 20 minutes ago I just drowned in the ♥♥♥♥ing ocean because i tried to be a ♥♥♥♥ing good guy. ♥♥♥♥ me. I'm gonna go beat this ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIGN SCORE:\n10/10 would play with nasty ♥♥♥ toys in room again","June 30, 2014","true","4.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","12"

This game, despite playing for just an hour and a half ... is amazing. I love it.\n\nHowever, despite this is an anime while it features a pretty girl with pink hair.. and the fact she's a princess- this isn't a game for the faint of heart. It's actually a strategy game where you must choose your actions carefully while advancing in a variety of skills. One wrong move, or one wrong step... you will die, brutally. I don't even mean in a funny way- you'll see your Queen murdered or killed in ways you didn't expect.\n\nIt makes your heart race, knowing if you weren't prepared or ready for a certain situation... you can end up screwed over. Luckily you can load from your save, but this game will push you into REALLY thinking things through.\n\nI highly suggest that you check the game out. It's awesome and everything about it proves itself being worthy of playing. Plus, it's a successful Indie game that won the Greenlight vote. So that there already says something about the game.","June 27, 2014","true","6.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","4"

Do not let the 'anime-kawaii-uguuu'ness scare you off and make you think less of this game.\nI was personally pleasantly surprised by this game, a text adventure accompanied by 2d images and an ocean of different choices which each can actually affect later outcomes. This can be learning about production and trade to help fund a business which will aid you later or having a high reflex, knowledge of archery and composure to avoid getting yourself killed. Do you want to focus on internal affairs? Have more knowledge about military stragedy? The list goes on and on and you can complete the game many times in so many different ways that its even worth its full price.\nThe music does loop a lot but is still enjoyable. I personally wish there was more story than there is as the game feels short, but again the replayablity somewhat makes up for that in the long end.\nI'd say give it a whirl, especially if its on sale. 6-7/10 in my eyes.","December 29, 2013","true","3.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

However, to expand upon my early statement, things are not random nor do they allow for more flexibility when learning skills, so it is very hard to actually do anything new.\n\nFor instance, I may not have enough Lore or Foreign Affairs to know this one thing because I only had a day to study two skills. Perhaps an increase in classes per day could overcome this.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic game, and I'm right now starting my military despot run.

It's a sort of visual novel with many branching plots and you must guide Elodie, the soon to be Queen through the following year safely to her coronation. Every week you choose skills to advance and have to deal with various situations in the kingdom (which is where all the story comes in). Your chosen skills then affect how you can deal with things.\n\nElodie is quite endearing but despite the cutesy artistic style this is anything but. Your death is assured with various assassination attempts, murders, accidents, monsters and so on ready to bring about your untimely demise. You can play in a vast variety of ways giving this huge re-playability. Replaying is a must if you want to see the huge variety of paths this story can take.\n\nThe music is quite fittign and really adds tot he mood. When something tragic is going to happen appropriate music plays, something sad starts - sad music start, really adds to the feelings you get from the story.\n\nGem of a game, really hope there is a sequel of sorts.

If that description means anything to you, you should buy this game. Long Live the Queen has surprisingly good gameplay, especially considering that it's a visual novel. The mechanics give you the feeling that you're plotting and planning (not just navigating a tree), and every bit of knowledge that is beyond your reach will make you paranoid.\n\nThe mechanics mesh well with the story to create a a feeling that you're making decisions, and not just clicking options or increasing stats. The writing is also top notch, which allows the game to cover very dark subjects with a light tone.\n\nThe central mechanic revolves around skill checks. You have around 42 distinct skills grouped into 14 sets of 3, that you can chose to increase each week by studying. The rate at which you learn a skill is based upon other skills you've learned in that set and category, and is significantly based upon your mood. Elode's mood will help and hinder your rate of learning significantly. You change Elode's mood by doing various activities, which makes the game feel a bit like Persona, but most activities modify multiple moods at once, which gives moods some inertia. So when you're playing you need to think carefully about what mood you want to be in next, and how you'll get there.\n\nThe writing for this game is wonderful. The aesthetics of the game and the introduction will tend to make you too naive your first play through, until some offended noble draws a sword and slits a criminal's throat right in front of you. There is no graphic violence, but the violence described is intense, and it will make you paranoid and fearful, even after you're done with the game.","December 30, 2013","true","8.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The Queen, or rather the soon to become queen.\nHer mother died, and the royal law grants her the queendom, however she must turn 15 first.\nAnd this is where your game starts, you start as the 14 year old soon to be queen, and your only goal\nis to keep you alive for one year, until coronation day!\n\nNow to gameplay, since this is a visual novel all you do is press buttons and read.\nBut there are a lot of buttons, first you have classes, and I'm not talking about RPG classes but rather\nschool classes, that you attend to raise your skills in agility, history, faith, etc.\nThese skills will be useful in one way, events.\n\nEvery week you will have certain events happen to you, and these events can be a problem, unless you have enough skill points. And belive me, you will have to re-try this a lot of times, because in the end it just comes to remembering what the events demand from you and then adapt to that in later playthroughs!

While the concept is decent enough, the game isn't long enough to make use of the varied stat building outside of "Different ending here, different outcome there", and that pales in comparison even to the most simple of Visual Novels that get by on only different endings, especially since the most variation in these comes in the form of....death?\n\nIf I wanted to die for different dialogue, I'd go play Dark Souls. I wouldn't get the dialogue but HEY, I'd die a lot. The story is meh...no, almost nonexistant to the point where you won't care about it enough for it to matter. It tries to have RPG like mechanics but really, this is just a royal version of Cute Knight with a lot more stats to level that have no meaning and no dungeon crawling.\n\nI need more than this, and this doesn't offer it to me.","June 11, 2014","false","3.8"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

But it's honestly just not fun for me. It was hard until I ran into all the ways to die, and then it just became tedious as I had to give up on training skills that I liked to train ones that I had no interest in every time I replayed it just so I didn't fail the skill check and die. Getting to the end isn't even fun, because it's not like I can beat it by training an Elodie that I think would make a good queen. It feels unfair that you have all these options but most of them are not actually viable choices. Gameplay feels less like customizing your princess and more like guessing which skills she'll need to stay alive.","January 25","false","20.6"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

It's great fun to spend the first while playing the full game through, trying to figure out how to reach coronation without falling prey to unfortunate events (they usually result in your death, but there are other fates that are unsatisfying enough to make you want to try again, too!). Once you've gotten to coronation once or twice, the list of deaths-I mean!-endings is an interesting checklist to complete (I only have one left!), and some of the achievements sound pretty interesting and fun to unlock as well. I'm saving heavily now to be able to tweak my skills without having to restart from scratch, but at this point even if I don't manage to get them all I'm pretty happy with my purchase and looking forward to trying out other games from the developer.\n\nEdited to add: Playing other VNs is helping me better understand why this one is so good. What you choose to study every week has a clear, visible impact on what may happen during the following week(s), because you see what skills are being checked. You can play a very different game depending on what skills you choose to focus on (e.g., I had a go at being nice the first time around and after the humiliating ending it led me to, I ended up putting all my points in military and executing everyone given half a chance in the next run-through ;) Which opened up new storylines I'd had no visibility in until then). You can have spies and send them out to do your bidding. There is no romance as a central plot point and choosing to marry someone (or not) is a more tactical decision. The "default" plot also makes it obvious that there are other storylines you might be interested in unlocking (e.g. the birthday party, Briony) to explore the game/world/deaths even further. Basically playing other games is making me like this one even more :-)","July 6, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moloko_noir/recommended/251990/","moloko_noir","Luna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moloko_noir/","434 products in account","Long Live The Queen (LLTQ) is a visual novel with the addition of a rather big skill tree, with skills affecting both the choice of decisions as well as the outcome of many situations. Failure (as in having your skill not high enough) often results in the death of the protagonist Elodie, whom the player controls/takes actions for.\n\nThe goal of the game is to survive long enough for Elodie to become crowned queen and the game is not short of obstacles planted in your way and killing Elodie off in quite a few ways, including but not solely consisting of being penetrated by arrows, killed by monsters, stabbed, getting the skull cracked or being poisoned. You as the player must send her to the appropriate classes (which will raise related skills) and have an eye on her mood, which may shift according to how she spends her weekends, whom she talks to and what happens around her and concerning her, and which affects at which rate she can learn a skill, where the right mood can more or less double the progression and the wrong mood can completely nullify any efforts in a skill's progression as long as it persists.\n\nWhile the main selling point seems to be said skill tree and the ever existing threat of being murdered, I did not find it particularly appealing. I cannot deny that it kept me going until my first hard earnt coronation, but my main problem with this system is that it is basically the traditional decision making of visual novels in disguise, which I suppose is there to add artificial difficulty, but it does not. It just lengthens the game rather unnecessarily.\nSince it's impossible for you to know what skills may or may not be necessary to avoid being brutally murdered, it comes down to trial and error most of the time. Even then, if you know why you died because a specific skill wasn't high enough, going back to a previous save and trying to raise that skill in time won't necessarily help because you either cannot get it high enough in time or you simply succeed in the situation only to find yourself in a new one where you die because another skill wasn't high enough and the whole process starts again.\n\nI'd like to illustrate this with two examples that struck me as particularly annoying and uncalled for (very minor spoilers inbound). If you just want to continue the review, skip those.\n\n####################################\nAt one point in the game, you will most likely face a war on sea. You can decide whether or not to lead your fleet personally or let them fight on their own. My Elodie being a strategic mastermind with all Military skills maxed out would lead the charge, of course. So I made preparations and the next week we sailed off. I was ready for a hard battle, with the enemy outnumbering us (a predicament that could have been avoided if I had invested in Divination way earlier in the game, granted, but how would I have known that).\nApparently I could have also studied magic and become a Lumen (a speallweaver in this game), to support the fleet with magical artillery fire (which would be unsufficient with just Elodie, I learnt much later).\nFear not, Elodie has studied great battles and is a master tactician, surely we can somehow turn the tide. Ooops, I didn't invest in climbing, so she failed to get up the mast to give orders using her binoculars. Our fleet was almost completey wiped out, we had to retreat (because her tactical foresight was well enough, otherwise Elodie would have died on the seas unless her swimming was good enough). What? Noone could help her up? Because a princess isn't a master tree climber our fleet failed to get the right orders? And how could I have possibly known that?\n\nThe other event is a more or less final battle in the game, in case your hold got invaded. You are being challenged to a duel by an enemy Lumen. If you accept and you aren't a Lumen, someone else will sacrifice themselves for you. If you are but your magic is not high enough, you die.\nSo I thought, I'll restart the game and become the best Lumen there is, surely I'll be able to hold them off this way. I did, I maxed out all related Lumen and Faith skills and all the other ones required to survive long enough. I started the duel and the game told me our powers were equal, so Elodie would need to come up with a trick to defeat him. I was given the choice to either conjure a magic sword and attack him or try to dazzle him to prepare for a finishing blow.\nSince I hadn't trained in swords, being a Lumen and all, and figuring I'd most likely have to pass a skill check, I decided to try to dazzle him. Being a masterful Lumen, Elodie had studied the effects of light and reflection, it seemed rather promising. But alas, the dazzling failed, because Elodie's Decoration skill wasn't high enough. Wait, what?\nThe weeks of studying of the magic arts and mysteries, the attunement of mind and body, all in vain because I didn't also instruct her to learn about flower arrangements. She died.\n####################################\n\nWhile I like the idea of combining rather curious skills to effect, the fact that you can't possibly know what skills you need and even then how high you need them totally nullifies the point of it all for me and reduces it to simple and tedious trial and error and going back to previous points to try the same thing again.\nRelated to that is that skills cannot be progressed higher than 50 unless you invest at least 25 in each skill of the corresponding category. But I found 50 to be utterly worthless because every important skillcheck failed and of course I don't know by how much. So in order to really use a skill, you will have to invest in the whole skill category, which is at least another 50 points (which translates to 1-5 ingame weeks on a game length of 40 weeks), which then leaves you open to die for other reasons.\nIt would be okay if you could finish the game (as in live to your coronation) with any given skillset, but at least in the games I played there are certain key points where Elodie will die if you didn't pick one of the selected skills that can save her.\n\nThe story in itself isn't very complex or particularly compelling. With there being so many characters of rather tangential importance and Elodie merely being a mold to be shaped into whatever you choose to, there isn't really any character with huge depth you could relate to and the game ends after 40 weeks at maximum, which is rather short once you skip the known dialogue.\n\nSo why do I recommend this game?\nBecause after I finished it regularly, which took me about 5-6 hours (in which I had fun, don't get me wrong), I looked up cheat codes to use in the ingame console. I raised all of Elodie's skills to 100, so I would automatically pass every skillcheck and the game's outcome became purely dependent on my choices. It played like a classical visual novel and I enjoyed it immensely. Exploring the different paths lead to some very hilarious and intriguing moments (such as being challenged to a duel by an arrogant noble only to incinerate him on the spot with Elodie giving a cheeky grin and saying 'I decline.')\nand there's still much to be found out. Things I couldn't have possibly been bothered to find out by dabbling with the skills. Plus, being the rather potent soon-to-be queen felt refreshing from all the helplessly being murdered.\n\nWhether or not the game's price tag is justified I find hard to say. While I did have a lot of fun I can also see it getting tedious real quick. The story isn't that great and if you don't like getting Elodie killed which seems to be point of the game, you'll have a hard time. Plus, there is a lot of great visual novels out there that are completely free.\nI think this game is for people who are into VNs and enjoy taking the game apart, making notes on a notepad and figuring out the paths and what is needed through many iterations until they reach perfection.If you just like VNs, you may still use cheats.\n","December 29, 2013","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Let me tell you, that was one of the happiest accidents of my life.\n\nLLTQ is an anime-esque visual novel-esque...thing developed by UK based Hanako Games, and it's quite something. LLTQ is a game where you die. And die. And die again. And then you die some more. Yet, dying is part of the fun. For example: someone wrote a silly letter to you about you doing *something* with a squid. Oh, no! A gust of wind picked it up and it's now hanging just off the balcony. Do you climb out to try to grab it?\n\n>Yes\nNo\n\nYou do? Well then, while climbing, you slip, fall, and break your neck on the ground. Your room is on the top floor of the castle, after all. Why would you try to climb from so high up? Idiot.\n\nExcept maybe if you picked yes and you actually trained beforehand to be a really good climber, you didn't fall and survived. See, that's what this game is about. Each week, you pick skills to take classes in. And, every so often, you're tested in certain skills depending on what situation arises in your kingdom which could mean life or death for you. And it's oh-so-fun. True, it's very trial-and-error, but with a game like this, with muliptle paths to victory (and many more to gruesome and painful death), that's just part of the experience.\n\nThis game is recommended for anyone who wants to become a pretty pink magical girl. ...I mean Lumen.

At least, that's what I wanted Long Live The Queen to be.  It actually plays more like a visual novel with a character building game attached to it.  A friend of mine called it pattern recognition, but that isn't exactly accurate, either.  There's trial and error, certainly, but it isn't strictly linear, and there's usually more than one way around any given major event.  The game also contains plenty of secret side content you can only see if you trend and manage your skills carefully, so it isn't a matter of simply save scumming your way to all the unlocks like your average visual novel.  (Though I certainly suggest keeping saves up to a few weeks back for strictly non-exploratory playthroughs.  Playing without a save to fall back on can also be an entertaining experience.)\n\nOne of the major features of Long Live The Queen is all the varied ways you can get yourself killed.  In Princess Maker II, for example, you can constantly throw your daughter into the crucible and she'll (usually) be okay.  Death to Elodie, the Queen to be, usually comes swiftly and, at least for your first few playthroughs, often at unexpected times.  One way to avoid them is to avoid the obvious situations where your skills don't fit the situation, but it's never a guarantee the reaper won't show up.  The game is short enough, at 30-odd turns, to make death more entertaining than infuriating, and also adds extra pressure to focus on the skills necessary to get the kind of happy ending you want.\n\nUnfortunately, the shortness is also why I can't suggest the game at full price.  It is a fun distraction with plenty of replayability, but what it offers can't really match the classics I was hoping it could recreate.  The Princess Maker series did have the benefit of corporate backing, however, and this is my sole disappointment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jennabun/recommended/251990/","jennabun","jennabun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jennabun/","20 products in account","This is one of my favorite games ever!\n\nOne of the things I love most about this visual novel is the fact that the choices ACTUALLY matter... like, a lot. What classes you take matter. What you do over the weekend matters. Who you talk to matters. Your mood matters. What outfit you wear matters. Everything - every little, miniscule thing you do - matters a lot and greatly impacts the story. Elodie faces a lot of difficult decisions and tasks, which makes your choices feel very important. I would sometimes analyze the same dialogue box for several minutes trying to decide which route to go. You may die a lot when you start playing the game... but the challenge is what kept me wanting to play!\n\nAlso, when we get right down to it, I just enjoy the story. It is rich with detail and quite exciting. Plus, the protagonist is compelling. Elodie is a character who interests me and makes me want to look deeper into her life. I loved the thrill of being a 14-year-old royal and knowing death could be lurking around any corner, yet having to venture on and try to make the best of every situation.\n\nThe options for romance are awesome. I adored how there are the traditional "queen marries a worthy gentleman when she takes the throne" paths as well as paths for same-sex partnerships and even no partnerships/marriage at all. Nice!\n\nThe only criticism I have really is the classes. I feel like the game gives you ALL THESE CHOICES for what classes to take, and only about half of them are ever relevant (at least in the paths I've taken). Why even include them at all? Just to confuse? I don't know.\n\nAnyway, buy this game! It's the best visual novel ever... I'm convinced that even people who usually hate visual novels could get into this one.","November 20, 2014","true","171.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Let me tell you, that was one of the happiest accidents of my life.\n\nLLTQ is an anime-esque visual novel-esque...thing developed by UK based Hanako Games, and it's quite something. LLTQ is a game where you die. And die. And die again. And then you die some more. Yet, dying is part of the fun. For example: someone wrote a silly letter to you about you doing *something* with a squid. Oh, no! A gust of wind picked it up and it's now hanging just off the balcony. Do you climb out to try to grab it?\n\n>Yes\nNo\n\nYou do? Well then, while climbing, you slip, fall, and break your neck on the ground. Your room is on the top floor of the castle, after all. Why would you try to climb from so high up? Idiot.\n\nExcept maybe if you picked yes and you actually trained beforehand to be a really good climber, you didn't fall and survived. See, that's what this game is about. Each week, you pick skills to take classes in. And, every so often, you're tested in certain skills depending on what situation arises in your kingdom which could mean life or death for you. And it's oh-so-fun. True, it's very trial-and-error, but with a game like this, with muliptle paths to victory (and many more to gruesome and painful death), that's just part of the experience.\n\nThis game is recommended for anyone who wants to become a pretty pink magical girl. ...I mean Lumen.

There are basically two fun playthroughs : the first one, for the amount of customization and choices you can make in general, and the last one, for getting that one ending you've worked for.\n\nEverything in between is hell. Prepare to save every single week and do a lot of backtracking. There's a final boss of sorts, which serves as the major obstacle in the game and will require a lot of planning and re-planning.\n\nOther than that, it's a pretty sweet game.

It's great fun to spend the first while playing the full game through, trying to figure out how to reach coronation without falling prey to unfortunate events (they usually result in your death, but there are other fates that are unsatisfying enough to make you want to try again, too!). Once you've gotten to coronation once or twice, the list of deaths-I mean!-endings is an interesting checklist to complete (I only have one left!), and some of the achievements sound pretty interesting and fun to unlock as well. I'm saving heavily now to be able to tweak my skills without having to restart from scratch, but at this point even if I don't manage to get them all I'm pretty happy with my purchase and looking forward to trying out other games from the developer.\n\nEdited to add: Playing other VNs is helping me better understand why this one is so good. What you choose to study every week has a clear, visible impact on what may happen during the following week(s), because you see what skills are being checked. You can play a very different game depending on what skills you choose to focus on (e.g., I had a go at being nice the first time around and after the humiliating ending it led me to, I ended up putting all my points in military and executing everyone given half a chance in the next run-through ;) Which opened up new storylines I'd had no visibility in until then). You can have spies and send them out to do your bidding. There is no romance as a central plot point and choosing to marry someone (or not) is a more tactical decision. The "default" plot also makes it obvious that there are other storylines you might be interested in unlocking (e.g. the birthday party, Briony) to explore the game/world/deaths even further. Basically playing other games is making me like this one even more :-)","July 6, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You guide the princess Elodie on her 40 week journey to coronation by choosing, week by week, what classes she will take and what skills she will build.  In addition, there are a number of events during the week where you get to choose how Elodie will handle them, which often impacts what skills she can build, or at least how effeciently she'll be able to build them.  Some events will always happen no matter what, while many others happen in reaction to the way you handled previous events.  Many of these events are deadly.\n\nWithin that framework, there's a lot of player choice and immense replay value.  It's impossible to build all of the skills in a single play through, and it's very difficult to anticpate which skills will be the most important when you first start out.  It will probably take a few tries to get Elodie all the way to her big day without her being poisoned, stabbed, shot, or blown up.  Even when you do, though, the game still has more to offer.  As the ending screen reminds you, Elodie's story doesn't have to end this way, there are many other options to explore.  And with each playthrough taking only a few hours, why wouldn't you at least try, just to see what happens?","September 23, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You get to advance two stats per week and it's a delicate balancing act depending on what you plan to do this time round. One thing you can't do though, is generalise. After so many playthroughs you realise you need to have a plan. If you don't want to fight you can manage through diplomacy, you can kick the attackers asses before they hurt you or even turn full magical girl, but specialisation is good. Like you might find in a Visual Novel there is a romance aspect to your developing plot. You can choose a king (or a queen if you're into that kinda thing) that will marry you after your coronation. But Unlike most visual novels, it's very much a footnote at the end.\n\nHonestly I found that it was a lot more rewarding trying to find all the ways to die. XD\nStabbed, burned, strangled, shot. There are a dozen or so different ways you can ultimately end at either the hands of your Enemies, your people or the nobles who lurk at your back.

It's never quite clear how your choices are going to affect your survival chances--until it's too late, leaving you scrambling for a save file where you didn't make that seemingly innocuous fatal error! Really keeps you on your toes, but it also takes a certain weight off decision making, because you really can't plan that far in advance, so you don't have to worry about making too "wrong" a choice. That isn't to say you can't be strategic. The game is balanced in that as long as you cover several bases, you can come back from almost anything (provided you have a close enough save point :P).\n\n2) The impressive depth of the story (various important characters don't even show up in certain playthroughs) also allows for massive replayability, with different routes feeling like very different experiences. This has the additional perk of making the chasing down of the many simple but sometimes elusive achievements not like a chore and more like a treasure hunt.\n\nBasically, Long Live The Queen is a really well executed choose-your-own-adventure game that I keep playing over and over again, trying to get that 100% completion, all the while having a great time and being majorly impressed at how it doesn't seem to be quite the same game every time I go through it.","February 15","true","84.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sadly, her mother just died and because in the empire of Nova Queens are the ones in charge, she needs to learn about what it is to be a good Queen to her subjects. This game tells a very diffrent princess tale than any princess tales that I have heard, saw or read about. Unlike thoes tales about princess needs to be rescued and needs a husband to the happy ending, this game tells the tale of what I have always waited from a princess story. Things about how to rule and run you'r kindom and learining the valuable stuffs that princess needs to learn. Well sure we had Mulan and Pocahontas, but they are rellay not real princessess.

You will become Queen in around a year, on your fifteenth birthday. In the meantime you must attend morning and evening classes each week to be able to handle the stressful situations that will arise. There are many qualifications that you'll need, but not enough time to learn them all. You're going to fumble and make mistakes, and probably die... a lot. You won't be able to have a "perfect" story... you will sometimes fail, but still be able to make it out in the end.\n\nEvery choice that you make in the game will affect the story, but in what way will not always be immediately apparent. Seemingly trivial choices may have disastrous effects and lead to a situation you're simply not prepared for. Even though you may survive the outcome of an event, it can still come back and bite you later in a different way. You are able to overcome challenges in multiple different ways, based on the skills and education you acquire during training. If you are well equipped to handle a situation, then you are given more choices that can lead to a superior outcome; however, if you're not prepared, then you won't have the tools required to benefit you and your Queendom.\n\nYou'll want to save often, and with multiple saves due to the volatile nature of your choices. If your story ends with you dying, sometimes there's not enough time to correct your mistakes... it could take multiple weeks for you to figure out and fully prepare a way to avoid your tragic demise. If you die, the story's over. If you give up your throne, the story's over. The only way to "complete" the game is to survive a year and become Queen... even then you might not be satisfied with your story. You can play through the game over and over again to tackle challenges differently, and find a story that you're happy with.\n\nThis is an excellent game, and is much deeper than it looks. On my first play-through I died, and when I went to start again, I noticed many of the events are the same, and occur no matter what you do... they just play-out differently. These events are pretty important to keep track of and prepare for. I felt they limited the story's flexibility at first, but it's hard enough to make all the right choices even when you know what's coming. The game generally won't give you enough notice to fully prepare for things, but that's good because it allows you to see flaws in your own decision making and prioritization. You see this same improvement in your character--transforming from uneducated, young, and foolish to strong, confident, and determined.\n\nIf you enjoy light reading and want a game where you actually have to make choices, and where those choices actually matter in a meaningful way, then this is for you... or if you just like princesses ♔ :3","January 7, 2014","true","5.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreeTacos/recommended/251990/","FreeTacos","Commissar Taco [GM]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreeTacos/","1046 products in account","Yeah, this game is actually quite good. I don't care either way about the anime art style, and there is an element of sameness sometimes when replaying it, but it's worth it just for the departure from the traditional computer RPG set-up. "Long Live The Queen" has the player as the Crown Princess of the kingdom of Something That I Can't Remember, and it follows said character through a bunch of encounters leading up to her coronation. It's important to note that isn't an action RPG -- while you train your character, essentially levelling up, and make decisions that affect the storyline, there's no fighting or gearing aspect beyond a fairly simple "wear this outfit to boost this skill" system.\n\nThe game is built around putting points into the Crown Princess's skill via her classes. Each day, she has morning and afternoon classes, and can gain points from each. How fast she learns certain topics depends on her mood, which is influenced by what else she's done recently. There are four separate scales, all of which can be influenced by her after school activities, that determine her mood and, thus, which classes she can learn from faster or slower. For example, when the Princess is feeling depressed, she has a boost to the number of points she can learn in one class in Animal Behavior. This works both ways, as some mood ratings act as penalties against classes, so you end up juggling the Princess's moods from week-to-week to build up ratings in the skills you want.\n\nAs you experience the encounters, there are some choice elements, but the vast majority of how you progress is built around skillchecks, and that's a big reason this game is pretty different from most of the RPG you see these days. It actually, in my opinion, feels a lot more like playing a pen-and-paper RPG than other games which share origins with dice-based games. The fact that skillchecks influence the storyline itself is quite cool, and frankly it's an idea that I'd like to see implemented in other games.\n\nThere are minor quibbles; the game does kill you a lot, and it's not always stuff you can reasonably see coming; one of your idiot friends will probably make fun of you for playing this game, and you'll be forced to hit him in the mouth with a bamboo stick; the replayability eventually frays a bit once you realize that the story has certain aspects that repeat no matter what route you take. But overall, this is a good game that's worth the buy at full price, despite it's flaws. The background story, and the lore of the kingdom and the version of magic that exists in this game are both interesting to read about. Did I mention the music? It's got a nice piano soundtrack, if that's your jam.\n\n"Pinkhaired Crown Princess Skillcheck-Based RPG" has no business being this much fun, but it is.","December 28, 2013","true","14.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The story deserves no praise, yet it motivated enough to keep trying to 'save my people'.)\n\n\nThis game caught me off guard. The mechanics of the game put you both in charge of what to study, somewhat like a teacher, and what to do. The results of your actions are not simply based upon which flags (past choices) you have gotten, but also 'points' in various skills, gained by studying, which determine whether or not certain choices are available, and which ones succeed or fail. The point system common in most western games (implemented very well in Cinders), but this is the first time I've seen it applied like this.\n\nIt works well once you get used to it, but at times it lead to disconnects between me and the character. Part of the game becomes you trying to teach Elodie (the queen to be) what she needs to get past some event. Fortunately, there are many ways to overcome these events, like learning bad omens from divination ...or sheer knowledge. It lets the game branch out a bit more organically than specific routes, but at the cost of being able to replay it easily.\n\nI wouldn't say the artwork is bad, I mean it gets the job done... but it does nothing for me. It's cute and inoffensive at best, and bland yet inoffensive at worst. You can gain various outfits for Elodie to wear throughout the game, and they all grant bonuses to a group of stats when you use them. The 'magical girl' outfit irks me as unfitting. The concept of magic in the artwork is easily the weakest part of the aesthetics.\n\nWriting is..decent. The story itself is decent but sometimes I question whether I'm playing as an idiot. Elodie has her own personality which is greatly shown in scenes where you don't have a choice. Apparently she's a young go-getter girl with a strong will, but I have trouble understanding how this young 14 year old *sheltered-all-her-life princess*  could say, after witnessing a killing in front eyes, "Clean this up." (With an angry puffed out manga-style expression, at that!) While on another scene she'd think to herself  "I don't know how to deal with handsome older men paying me compliments!". I think my main complaint about the writing is that age-wise it's inconsistent.\n\nI finished this within 4.4 hours, that is to say, I've gotten to a 'good if bittersweet' end after 10 or so bad ends. The replay value, I'm not too sure. That depends on how many possible routes I missed, which I didn't check too thorougly as I was too focused getting through my current route correctly. I will go back to it sometime.\n\nDespite all its faults and shortcomings, I enjoyed and recommend Long Live The Queen. Not without caution, though. If you are interested, I suggest you to try the demo as this may be too 'mechanically unique' for your liking.\n\n\n","May 22, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/recommended/251990/","arleas","arleas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/","1379 products in account","The idea behind this game is rather simple.  You're the princess of a country and you have to prepare for your coronation so you can become the queen.  The problem is that some people don't want you as queen.  Some people would rather be the ruler themselves.  Some people might not have a problem with ending your life so that this could happen.\n\nSo what do you do?  Well, basically you go to school every day and learn stuff in hopes of raising skills to a point where you can fend off these attacks.  The problem is, you can't expect to learn everything easily.  Your mood affects which skills you can learn and how fast you can learn them.\n\nSo how do you fix that?  Well, you have a choice of activities that can affect your mood in several ways.  Some activities open up for a very short time, some open up as the result of other skills being learned.  Other activities have desired and less desired effects (you have to take the good with the bad).\n\nIf you used to like those "Choose your own adventure" books, this has a similar feel to it, except the plot can go a bunch of different ways depending on how you worked on your skills.  You won't just be able to say "oh, I need to choose this so I can get the good ending" because you have to manage your mood AND study the right courses to get to a point where that option is even available.\n\nA nice bonus for studying extensively in a certain set of courses is that you unlock a costume that boosts your skills...so now you have the added benefit of choosing an outfit to help you through a tough portion of the game.  For example, if you know that military skills are needed for an upcoming section, you can change into your military outfit and you'll stand a chance of doing better than you would otherwise.\n\nThere's no stress or time limits to how you choose to play the game, and you are free to plot out how to get the best possible endings...in fact the game lets you save pretty much the entire game to a text file so you can study the choices you made and figure out what went wrong.   If you're the careful planning and analytical type, you'll probably enjoy this.\n\nIf you are the type to spin the wheel and/or flip a coin when presented with a choice, you won't last long, or if you do, you'll have no idea what it is you did to get there.  This game isn't easy...but it isn't frustrating really.  The game gives you the option of seeing which skills failed and which ones passed as the story goes along, so if you die you can see what it was you needed to prevent it from happening.\n\nIf you're hardcore, you'll turn this option off and just try to use logic, though sometimes your idea of logic will differ from the game's idea...keep in mind that this is a 14 year old girl and not you... YOU know not to eat strange food shipped to you from weird addresses, but Elodie doesn't (unless you teach her the right things)\n\nThis is going to be the game I play when I'm in the mood to kick back and think instead of worrying about reaction times or aiming skill.   I just added +15 to my judgement abilities.","December 4, 2013","true","3.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/108/recommended/251990/","108","takua108","http://steamcommunity.com/id/108/","482 products in account","Long Live The Queen is a game with a fantastic setup and promising mechanics. It sounds fun on paper, and the writing, art, and concepts for how the game works mechanically are all pretty great; in the end, though, I just found it frustrating to play. I'd still recommend getting it on sale if the theme, premise, setting, and art are all up your alley, because you'll definitely enjoy yourself at least somewhat... but I feel like the game could've been so much more if it had leaned more into the role-playing as opposed to the tired visual novel idea of playing the game over and over again, getting tons of Bad Ends, in order to get even one Good End.\n\nOn your first playthrough, planning out classes and trying to balance Elodie's mood seem like super interesting mechanics and if you're into the aesthetic of the game and the stuff you saw in, like, the Steam trailer and screenshots, you'll be thinking it's like the greatest game ever. The writing is great, the way taking classes shows you a brief overview of the progressively more advanced topics you're learning in a given subject is neat, and man, like everything about the presentation of the game itself is fantastic.\n\nYou notice as you play along that you're failing like every single skill check. You might even be like "aw man, I missed this Poisons check? Better bone up on Poisons" — only to find that you'll like never need Poisons again for the rest of the game. (Disclaimer: I have yet to complete a successful runthrough of the game, but have spent over three hours of time in the game according to Steam.) Then you'll die from something out of nowhere that you could've never seen coming and prepared for on your first time through.\n\n"Okay," you think, "I'll give it another shot. This is clearly just a mechanics'd up visual novel, anyways, so I guess I should've expected hell of Bad Ends." On your subsequent playthroughs, you'll attempt to adjust your class schedules accordingly such as to allow you to pass checks for events that you now know are coming up from your previous playthroughs. Then, when you train for a key class, you'll get little-to-no skill points from it because you weren't watching your mood. Or worse yet, you were watching your mood and thought to make your princess as happy as possible because she starts the game all sad and depressed over the death of her mother, but as it turns out some class you wanted to take does barely anything or nothing at all for you because of the mood you're in. You search around the UI and try and find some sort of reasoning for which classes are affected by which moods — and it turns out that there is no such thing (although they [mostly] follow some sort of logic). Instead, you must either figure out which classes are affected by which moods on your own and write them down in a grid on a piece of paper... or just check the top-rated Steam guide for the game.\n\nBasically, in the end, the game becomes more of an exercise in replaying the game over and over and learning from your failures, taking notes on what worked and what didn't, in order to come up with a plan to make a successful run through the game. If this sounds appealing to you, that's fine; I was hoping for a much more role-playing-oriented experience out of the game, myself. Again, I understand that it's a relatively short game once you have the path for "the right run" down, and the length of the experience comes from the act of replaying it over and over again, and also it's just a more mechanically-dense visual novel, when it comes down to it. These things are all fine, but it's just not quite what I hoped for given the promise of the game from the outset and the great writing the game has and such.\n\nIn summary, I feel like the game has a great setup, great art, great writing, average sound and music, and great mechanical premise... but just kind of crappy actual mechanics in the end. It's still worth playing if the theme and setting and stuff interests you, and even more so if you're willing to put up with the visual novel tropes that make several, several playthroughs a must if you want to see a non-death ending... but at the end of the day, I personally wound up finding the core gameplay systems to be frustrating and poorly thought-out.\n\n★★★☆☆","December 31, 2013","true","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Afterwards, you can train your skills and get bonuses and penalties depending on your mood. For example, if you're angry you'll get a bonus for war and sport-related skills while being depressed helps you express your creativity.\nYou have to discover all of this by yourself though, which means that there is a LOT of trial and error involved.\n\nYou will die/fail a lot in this game, so you'll see that some events will always happen while others will trigger only if you train a specific skill before passing a check, or selecting a specific dialogue option. Figuring everything out will take a long time, and sometimes getting the same dialogue over and over can be tiring, but, of course, there is a skip option. (CONT.

You take control of Elodie, a 14 year old princess of Nova, tasked with becoming queen after her mother died or unusual circumstances. However Nova is not a very safe nation, their are many dangers around the corner and something as innocent as chocolate can and will be the death of you.\nThe game is very difficult as many has stated before, and if you save to much you'll not have enough time to train in stats you need for certain events, so that adds an extra layer of challenge, which is why only completing a single run though and several failed ones is an achievement for me. One of the things that make's the game very interesting is all the skills you can practice, you're never going to be able to complete every skill, and the game will check every skill several times and will have "big" moments where the skills will be very handy, which adds great replay-ability.\nHowever of the games short comings is the repetitiveness, the intro is always the same and the events are always the same, just with new solutions but it can be very boring at times. The art isn't particularly amazing either, most if it looks like it was made in a generator of sorts and doesn't look natural, and almost none of the faces give off any emotion and sometimes the dialogue barely does either..I can't tell if Josyln is suppose to happy, dead or just emotionally dead half the time.\nAs a whole, the game is a good "Visual Novel Strategy Game" that kept me hooked and made me come back every time the DAMN BANDITS KILLED ME.","February 22, 2014","true","10.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Older kids should be fine.)\n\nThis game is not a graphical powerhouse, and the gameplay is pretty limited compared to some of today's modern games.  It is not an open world to explore for hours upon hours upon hours.  And yet, it will likely reel you in.  How?\n\nWhat it sets out to do, it does very, very well.  This is a simple strategy game where basically you have to find the secret formula of what to study in what order, and what actions to take to keep your little princess character alive long enough to become the queen.  Sounds simple?  Wrong!  You will find plenty of new and unexpected ways to die!  Some are difficult to avoid.  So, you try again. This is basically the gameplay: try again.  Keep trying until you get it.  For some people, this may be incredibly frustrating.

I was, however, quite disappointed when I found out that most of the  skills our *Queen* can learn are useless throughout the whole game or just necessary for one time and that’s it. This arbitrary system really hurts the game a lot in my opinion. Moreover, the fact that the events of the game are not random but completely fixed, means that you eventually learn how to beat the game just by following a certain order without any logic behind it (besides some hints that end up being not that useful)\n\nNevertheless, I had fun playing it and trying to get to the end of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cublikefoot/recommended/251990/","cublikefoot","cublikefoot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cublikefoot/","2402 products in account","Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/long-live-the-queen-game-review/\n\nMany of you may just look at Long Live the Queen and pass it off as some “girly anime game”. I too thought that the game looked a bit silly, but I was surprised by just how enjoyable it is. It’s almost a masterpiece, which is not something I’d say too easily.\n\nLong Live the Queen is essentially a visual/interactive novel, but it goes a lot more in-depth in terms of interactivity that most visual novels do. You’re tasked with getting the main character, Elodie, to her coronation as Queen of Nova without getting killed. Although the game seems incredibly childish, it’s actually quite morbid. There are several deaths that Elodie can run into, with my first one being an arrow to the side, of which my “battlefield medicine” skill was not high enough for me to survive the incident.\n\nThe other half of the game, aside from making good choices, is made up of skills. Elodie can learn a variety of skills. It’s actually a bit overwhelming, the amount of different skills that can be learned. Every week, you have the choice of choosing two classes to take during that specific week, with each skill having its own class. Each of these skills is a part of a group of skills, which is a part of another group of skills. For example, the “Social” skill tree is made up of three skills: Royal Demeanor, Conversation, and Expression. Each of these breaks down even further, into three “sub-skills”. Expression breaks down into: “Decoration”, “Instrument”, and “Voice”. The four major categories for skills are: Social, Intellectual, Physical, and Mystical.\n\nDuring the development of the game’s story, you’ll encounter various “skill checks” during the dialogue portions of the story. Passing a skill check is always good, as it progresses the story in a positive way (and can help prevent your death). Failing a skill check usually does not matter too much, but in some scenarios, failing a skill check can actually cause your death.\n\nThere’s also another major aspect to this game, that being Elodie’s mood. Her mood changes based on what happens during the storyline of the game and the choice you make at the end of the week as to what Elodie will do during the weekend. There are four sets of moods in the game, with two different emotions in each: Afraid — Angry, Depressed — Cheerful, Yielding — Willful, and Lonely — Pressured. Whichever mood is dominant determines the skill bonuses for that specific week (each “turn” in the game is another week). Each mood gives a bonus and a penalty to certain skills. The “depressed” mood gives a bonus to expression and animal handling, but a penalty to royal demeanor, conversation, and athletics, with all other skills remaining neutral. This can be used to greatly improve any of Elodie’s skills, depending on her mood that week.\n\nLong Live the Queen was a very, very fun experience. If I had to criticize the game, I’d note that the player has no idea which moods correspond to which skills in terms of bonuses and penalties (until you have that specific mood), so the use of a wiki is almost essential. I prefer to go at it and learn myself, but I could understand one using a wiki to avoid getting penalties when attending classes. Also, unless you use a wiki, you’ll have no idea when a certain skill will be required anytime during the story. You may get the hang of it after playing the game for an extended period of time though. Highly recommended!","January 8, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I enjoyed it for a little bit, but overall I think it's lacking.  There are two main reasons why I find this game a bit lack-luster, and you can take them for what they are worth:\n\n1.)  Every playthrough has the same plot.  So if you die (which you almost certainly will), you have to sit through the same plot devices every round.  Although there are clearly efforts made to give you several options, I still found myself trying to skip fast enough to get to new plots.  I think randomized events mixed into a few core events would have made replaying much more fun.\n\n2.)  The way that bonuses work make it super beneficial to max out a set of skills.  The more you know about a skill, the more you learn by training that skill.  You should avoid this trap, because if you are missing a few particular skill, it could lead to you dying very early in the game.  I think they could have been more creative about how the went about skill training to encourage a more diverse skillset and allow players to succeed in more skill checks.\n\nThose two reasons are primarily why I couldn't keep playing this game.  It is worth a playthrough or two if you can get it cheap and like sim games, but not something you'll likely want to keep coming back to.","August 25, 2014","false","4.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The problem with this is that if you neglected said skill (or group of) you're toast; you were practically dead 10 turns ago, but you just have to keep playing until the game decides to kill you.\n\nSeeing the tweaks that have been made to the game, I believe that something could be done to help the gameplay without straying from the concept of the game. For example, starting a new game from a previous death while inheriting a part of your previous skills would make sense, while also giving it genuine replay value (other than having a list of "things to study by turn X to not die").\n\nThis is a game for the hard-core and can actually be pretty entertaining if you enjoy that "grinding", but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone because of said reasons.","March 6, 2014","false","4.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

There's really nothing to this game except playing it over and over again until you learn what precise combo of skills lets you become who you want to become, and it overall just feels like an incredible time-sink with very little reward for the player.\n\nExample - I trained to be a badass magical warrior, with high Swordsmanship, Magical attack, and Magical defence. I then lost a magical duel because I'd never studied flower arranging. I could not have known that was coming, except by doing all that, dying, and then starting -completely over- and training my princess very slightly differently.\n\nThis is the bulk of Long Live the Queen's gameplay.","December 3, 2014","false","3.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

It suffers from some repetition in that a good portion of the time you invest will be spent attempting to figure out which combinations of choices you make will lead to each ending (and avoid death in the process). The save feature cuts down on this a bit, but if you haven't had previous experience with this type of game, then you are going to be doing a lot of backtracking and starting over. On the other hand, if you know the trick to playing this sort of resource management game, you can easily earn your crown with a half-dozen deaths or less, and in just a couple of hours. The multiple endings add replay value, but you still face the same issues mentioned before. I found the art, UI, and story to be sufficiently engaging, but the music felt somewhat generic, and the $9.99 price tag seems a tad high. I would say buy this when it is on sale for maximum bang for your buck. In the meantime, if you still want to play a game like LLtQ, try the Princess Maker games. They are much more in-depth and have an RPG element to them as well.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 7/10 - good enough to own and play, bad enough to be a little picky as to when you get your copy, and put it off in favour of better games.","November 18, 2014","true","64.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

You also only get one year in LLTQ, as opposed to the 8 years of game time in a round of PM. The other obvious difference between the two games is that in LLTQ, Elodie can die. And she will die.

(Hint: frequent saves on multiple save files are your very, very best friend.) This game also benefits from the reasonably engaging story line (drama and intrigue galore; shades of Game of Thrones), stats system based on education (appealing to my dorkiest tendencies), and general adorableness even when your princess is skewered on somebody's rapier. It's a bit like a visual novel and RPG meshed in an oddly endearing way.

A largely story-driven affair, I really enjoy my time playing this one. If you've played through visual novels before, a large portion of the game will be familiar to you, with lots of reading alongside static images. The neat part comes from leveling up the skills provided to the princess. Often with games of this sort, I feel that it's largely formulaic. Once you have the parts down pat, the game loses it's interest. Long Live The Queen, however, deviates from this formula by throwing random events in alongside the normal story's progression. While certain events will happen each playthrough, sometimes new things will pop up at inconvinient times because of your skill progression or previous choices; it really keeps you on your toes.\n\nTL;DR: If you like reading and don't get frustrated by retrying often, get this game.","February 7, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall it's worth a play, but I'm not too sure on the 10 dollar price tag.\n\nThat being said, I think it's a dark, cute little game with lot's of good comedy and excellent art. The dialogue is well written and translated and the multiple endings and choices help a LOT with replay value. Overall I give it a 7/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/violit/recommended/251990/","violit","Violit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/violit/","48 products in account","Long Live the Queen is the kind of game that takes the visual novel genre and makes it into something that's both frustrating yet fun. Similar to the Princess Maker games from Japan, the goal of the game is to aid Princess Elodie into Queendom so that she can continue looking after the realm. You do this by making decisions for Elodie and deciding which classes she should attend (2 per week) in order to polish her into a tru gem. Of course, it's not as simple as that.\n\nThe story has multiple endings and many twists and turns which often evolve in the death of our dear Elodie. Commoner uprisings, magical wars and coups are all parts of what you have to avoid running into whilst hoping that along the way someone doesn't try and trick Elodie into eating poisoned chocolates.\n\nThe game is fun with a lot of decisions but can get frustrating after seeing Elodie stumble at the same hurdle over and over again. Gameplay is literally using a mouse to pick decisions but the interactivity of the story makes up for it. The additional clothes for Elodie are a nice touch. If you're an achievement hunter there are plenty of achievements to be found, and as there are different storylines there's a lot of replaying that can be done with satisfyig conclusions. Towards the end when you have almost 100% it can get tedious going through the same story again and again, however.\n\nOverall this game is great in any collection and not just for girls. :) Long live the Queen!","November 8, 2014","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If somebody told me I would spend over 15 hours playing this game I would not believe it. This is a visual novel which means that you basicly play through a story making descisions along the way changing up the story everytime you play it through (which can take between 10-40 minutes). Depending on the path you take you will lead to different endings and a lot of them being... your death.\n\nThroughout the game you will level up different traits, depending on what you choose to focus on different part of the stories will be easier for you to complete and changes your possible paths. If you fail a test it's not the end of the world unless... you die. And even if death comes a lot and often and forces you to restart it's acutally not frustrating, instead it works as a motivator to play differently next time.\n\nWith every restart you want to know what happens if you level different traits, completing a trait test you didn't complete the last time. For example, if I become a animal trainer will my pet dog become a great strong guard dog? Or will I be able to tame animals throughout the story? You want to know!\n\nI do understand this game is not for everyone, if you're not a fan of slow/reading heavy games you probably dont want to get this. But if you get a chance to try it, DO SO. Suprisingly fun and of course you want to collect every possible DEATH achievement...\n\nRecommended!\n\n/ Nurgleprobe","January 12, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well think no more my friend, for this game has the answer.\n\nIt starts with you (Princess Kawaii) being pulled out of school by you father because your ♥♥♥♥♥ of a mother selfishly died. With her out of the picture, it becomes your duty to become the next princess. You do this by taking 2 different classes every week which in turn increase some of your skill levels. However this isn't like Skyrim where you can be a god at everything, instead you need to be a bit more carfull in what skill you want to increase.\nFor example, if you wish to level up your intelect through history and diplomancy, you may be able to flatter that losser of a Prince after you remember his birthday. However in doing this you probably won't be skilled enough to dodge the arrow that just penetrated your Liver. Oh look, you're dead, try again...\n\nAfter you have completed your classes for the week, you than get see some more of the story unfold. It is also here where your learnt skills come into action, as they determin your success. You also get to make some choices in these events that ultimatly determin the fate of you and your kindom. There are also alot of pre-set events that you can't do anything about, so I wouldn't get to exited.\nMy personal favourite event was when some peasent sent me a fanfiction of me having sex with a Squid.\nAfter these events you get the option of choosing an activity to do over the weekend, this affects your mood, which in turn affects how well you learn in your classes. Say if you are in an Angry mood, you will get a bounis in Swordfighting, but you will recive a penalty to Accounting.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to play this game, however it can't can't give you endless enjoyment like 'Barbie Dollhouse Adventure' as after a few tries at the game, you notice that the story may be fairly linear. But that may have just been because I wasn't very imaginative with what actions I took during the game. I don't really have many dislikes with this game, possibably because I came in not expecting very much. One annoyance was that the only charater that shows any emotion at all is you. Also be prepared with the lore in this game, as there are heaps of Dukes and Duchesses which I couldn't be bothered to remember.\nI bought this game when it was on sale for $1.50 and I personally think $10 is a bit too much for this game.

This game is ♥♥♥♥ED UP. I took a small look at the Steam cards for the game, and they're all ways you can be murdered within the game with adorable pictures of our unnamed princess in various horrific ends to her life. My favorite being 'Run Through' which she has a shocked expression with a cutlass THROUGH HER CHEST. But don't worry, it's in a chibi type art style! So it's not too gruesome. That doesn't change the fact that this points out at least part of the game in centered around death, and the death of the main character. Hell, at the beginning her mother died. If she had the luck of her daughter, I couldn't imagine why.\n\nThe exposition is fairly tame in a game you'd expect to take up your entire expierence before you just give up and play another game. The point of the game? It took me a while to figure out, but the princess is trying to be married. So you are NOT a queen, but that's just nitpicking. Firstly, I can't stand most of the canidates that she's supposed to take the hand of for marriage. I couldn't find an interesting one anywhere, and to be fair, the princess and her cousin (which is briefly killed off by a snake) are the only ones I found with personality. The rest of them are very..Emotionless. To be honest it matches their pictures in game pretty well.\n\nI do like the skill system in this game, very complex and the game keeps you thinking on which one you should train in next. One situation, you'll have to use reflexes to LIVE or you'll be screwed over because you don't have enough knowledge of foreign countries!...And it turns into a shoot and miss simulator. You just have to pray you trained in the right stuff. I love the art this game delivers though, of course I love the style, being anime and such. I mean I love anime, as you can see from my profile picture. Gameplay is simple, it's a strategy game that's not forgiving in any way. I've played a lot of unforgiving recently, Five Nights at Freddy's 2, Risk of Rain, Rogue Legacy, hell even Dark Souls 2 and this definitely amung those titles. Although I'm not sure with the difficulty spike in this game as the other titles follow (except Rogue Legacy that just starts out difficult). More of just an awkward curve before the game upright kills you.\n\n6.2/10\n","December 29, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At first glance it looks like some girly game only a weeabo or a girl would play, but I was wrong. Comparing this game to Princess Maker is actually insultng. There is much more depth and much more outcomes that can happen based on what you leveled up in. The fine details of the story are easily forgotten but the gist of the story is easy enough to understand. The game takes roots from magical girl culture from Japan with a basic RPG system. If you love exploring new outcomes and experimenting different ways of trying to acomplish something this is the game for you. The game is VERY slow paced and there is no gameplay to speak of; basically like a visual novel. I highly reccommend this game to anyone into visual novels or likes games where you take your time like turn based games like Civ. 5.

The game also washes your dishes, files your taxes, and reminds you to call your mother on her birthday.\n\nSounds like a game worth having, right?  But what if it cost $10,000, along with half your hair, both your index fingers, your favorite toe, and the promise of eternal agony in your least preferred afterlife?  It's probably not worth it then, right?\n\nLong Live The Queen is a game that is not the apotheosis of all games.  As such, I'd judge its non-sale Steam price of $9.99 as too high.  But if you buy it for $1.99 during a sale, then I'd say it was definitely worth it.\n\nAt its heart, Long Live The Queen is a choose-your-own-adventure about a princess hoping to survive to queendom.  It has the added twist that each day, you choose two of 14 classes for your princess to take - classes ranging from Royal Demeanor to Climbing to Military Strategy.  Story branches appear and disappear according to your choices, and it is easy to end up impaled by a sword or punctured by arrows or eaten by krakens.\n\nThis has reasonable amusement value, one that does eventually wear off; laughter turns to snickers turns to forced grins.  Fortunately, by the time I reached the eyeroll phase, I judged my enjoyment of the game up to that point to be worth roughly $2.61.  Which meant that I did more than break even on this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stoneth/recommended/251990/","Stoneth","Stoneth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stoneth/","1103 products in account","Long Live The Queen is a simulation role-playing-game that places you in the role of a princess on the road to becoming queen. Placing aside the images usually conjured by well-known fairy tales, being a princess as it turns out is very difficult. To make it to your coronation you will need to better yourself and make important decisions along the way. There is a lot to learn as a princess, everything from etiquette to history to military strategy to athletics and everything in between. Careful selection of what you learn and how well you learn it can open up new opportunities as well as avoid nasty failures on skill checks. How well you learn a subject is also dependent on your mood which can shift depending on what actions you take and how you spend your weekends.\n\nIn many ways, Long Live The Queen is similar to Princess Maker which also features a princess with different skills to learn. The key difference being that in Princess Maker you play a king raising a daughter where as Long Live The Queen places you in the role of the princess dealing with political issues of every sort. There is a lot of agency to Long Live The Queen and the story can take radically different turns depending on what actions you take and how well versed you are in certain subjects. So there is much more at stake in Long Live The Queen than in Princess Maker. Who do you trust? Do you take the diplomatic solution or use force? Do you get involved in problems where success is not guaranteed? The first few times playing you will usually meet an untimely demise before ever seeing your coronation.\n\nOverall, Long Live The Queen is a fantastic and refreshing game. With so many decisions to make, there are a number of directions the story can go. And even if you fail, it's still enjoyable to just get back up and try again with something different. So if you've ever wanted to be a princess or just have fun as a ruler, I would highly recommend this game.","July 1, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You might be a little overwhelmed in the first playthrough by the amount of skill-sets, but you will soon get the hang of it. It is good that the game gives you feedback whenever a skill passed or failed to adapt you strategy for your next playthrough. Therefore I recommend also to save often and in different slots, because you will run into "dead ends" if you level up the wrong skills.\n\nI also like the mood system. Different moods give you bonusses for different skills, e.g. "Depression" boosts artistic skills, why "Angry" boosts military skills. I really like this system, because it justifies each "mood". There are also different outfits to unlock which also boost certain skills. Also a nice way to customize your charakter.\n\nThe story is well written, but it's a little difficult to get to understand the different realms and relations between the charakters.\n\nAnother motivating aspect is in a "completionist" way to unlock as many "deaths" or other achievements as possible. The "skip" function helps to try different approaches in a quick way.\n\n","July 13, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Turns out it only looks like one.\n\nThe game is about Elodie and you have 40 weeks to level skills and make sure she survives those 40 weeks, but there are a lot of different ways to die and a lot of random events to keep it interesting.. Although after a bit the events become a bit repetitive and they're predictable (as in which week they happen), but you won't get all events every time you play the game.\n\nYou can make choices during most of these events and your skills affect most if not all events happening in the game, which is really fun.\nBesides levelling skills, you also have 4 mood bars to keep balanced. The moods affect how quick you level skills.\n\nSo basically, it looks cute and anime but there's some strategic thinking involved. I liked it the first round but became frustrated after dying for the 8th time or something. Though if you enjoy thinking of strategies, I recommend this game.\nThe events are predictable but there are many to keep it interesting.. So..

I saw this and knew it was an obvious reimagining of the same idea. I never really played visual novels before, but after two hours into this experience I was enthralled. So simple, so stupid, there's no reason I should have enjoyed it as much as I did. Limited ability to fill your wide assortment skill sheets adds for some incredibly demanding replay value as you'll wanna keep seeing what happens differently. If you're a fan of anime drama and comedy like I am, you'll probably love this. If this isn't your flavor, by no means will it change your mind, but it's a ton of fun and a great way to relax. Heavy action games are great, playing online with friends is great, but here it's all about interesting decision making. It's silly and cute to fault and some of the writing is just plain duimb, but that's the charm of it. it's a surprisingly entertaining experience and an easy recommendation for people who like anime comdies and or old PC adventure games.\n\n...long live this game","June 27, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are effectively "managing" a princess to become the best ruler of the realm she will inherit. It is well designed for multiple playthroughs with various narrative paths to follow and secrets to uncover, with a bit of a roguelike approach to difficulty. The price may be a little high for some, especially if you are not sure if this is your cup of tea. If so, I highly recomment picking it up when it is on offer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weactonimpulse/recommended/251990/","weactonimpulse","matthewbluelight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weactonimpulse/","42 products in account","The game is fun, but very short and severely lacking. I beat it in less than a day.\nThe game is basically like one of those old DOS command lines, but with a GUI. Instead of typing, for example\n/attack\nyou would click a dialog on screen that reads\n"Attack!"\nThe story is mildly interesting, and mildly emotional. The dialogue gives you a good idea of what is going on. You can train Elodie in different skills. In one part of the game (minor spoilers, doesn't affect story) somebody sends you a box of chocolates that is poisoned. If Elodie is proficient in divination she will notice a bad omen and you will have the option of not eating the chocolates. If she has proficient knowledge in poison, medicine, or herbs she will be able to heal after ingesting the poison. If Elodie hasn't been trained in any of these things she will eat the chocolates and die.\nI really wish the game would continue past coronation. It is very fun and entertaining, some of the battles and dialogue is really intense and gets you going. It stops short, however. It would also be cool if there was more visual feedback. Instead of:\n"A fierce battle rages on. elodie makes lots of explosions with her magic and bodies fly everywhere" it would be cool if there were animations that showed these things happening. Sometimes the battles can be difficult to visualize and it takes you out of the moment.\nThat being said the game is very fun to play and I definitely recommend it for those who like command line or RPG games. It is very fun and I enjoyed it very much.","June 23, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first time I opened it, I ended up playing for four hours straight, just trying to get coronated. Oh, did I mention it's also really hard? Yes, it's ridiculously easy to die and super difficult to get coronated. But that's the fun! It's very cute visually, with a dark humour that appeals to me. The ads for this are very accurate; you can mold Elodie any way you choose depending on her moods, but chances are you'll be poisoned by chocolate. Trust me, that happens a lot.\nMy one complaint is that it seems you need to have max in one skill in order to win. This may just be my playing (though I've played through more than 20 times) and that seems a tad unfair. This comes from the fact I've noticed that, once you've figured out the game, it doesn't seem to change much. I haven't found different ways to die in a while (odd complaint, I know). But aside from that, it's still really addictive and though the story may not change much, the WAY you play does and that makes it interesting. If you like sim games, cutesy things and have a dark side, this game is for you. Avoid the chocolate though ;)","June 24, 2014","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course, many dangers and many problems will try to prevent her until her coronation.\n\nWell... What I'm thinking about this game? In my opinion, it's definitely a good visual novel game. There are so many choices, so many paths, and many events we can trigger as long as we have the correct skills. The story is quite interesting, there are noble plots, execution, many things we could find during middle age. And as long as with some magical girl as well.\nEach week of the game, we have her mood to manage which can affected her lessons. For example, if she's depressed, some of the lessons will have a penalty while others will have a bonus. After each lesson which will increase a skill, she can do an activity during her free time and it will mostly affect her mood if we need to train others skills faster.\nAlso, during the scenes, you have to manage your reliationships as well. We'll meet many people like dukes and we also have to be careful to not upset them or they might plot to kill you. You can also make commoners happy or angry depending on your actions, but be careful if they rebel against you.\nDepending on our actions, the story can end happily or badly. If we want to discover everything in this game, we'll often have to start the game from the beginning, trying different skills and/or paths.\n\nNow... The game is short but since there are many events to try, so, we often have to restart from the beginning and trying another path. Yet, the problem, we tend to see the same scenes again... And again... But thanksfully, we can possibly skip the scenes. Her mood can be tricky to manage as well, especially when we need a certain mood to train many skills faster.\nAnd that's not all... When we trigger an event and trying to suceed it, we don't know which skills we need first and so, we tend to die a first time because we don't have the correct skill. And when we try this event again with the correct skill... Well, often, we need another skill to suceed it! And that can be frustrating at some point... And sometimes, we have to start from the beginning many times until we found the correct skills we need (unless we're following a guide). So, it is recommend to do many saves but not necessarily.\n\nIn conclusion... It's not a bad game but not a perfect one. As for me, I quite enjoyed it anyway. It was fun and music was quite touching. Many funny things can possibly happen too. I'll say it's mostly a game for people who like interactive stuffs. ^^","June 28, 2014","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some come random to bite your cute royal bottom - like a box of suspicious but very delicious-looking chocolates, or an invasion. Certain things - such as magic - should be earned first and then learned by hard work.\n\nAdorable protagonist, nice atmosphere, some UI quirks, jokes and references, little unlockables, gameplay mainly driven by trial and error.

Every week, you can pick two classes to let Elodie study on, varying from social skills to combat experience.\nAn important factor is Elodie's mood: It's hard to be social when you're depressed, but that's a good opportunity to learn more about something cheerful, like singing. Each weekend you can let Elodie do an activity that affects her mood (while the story may also affect it a little, such as a snake scaring Elodie). When skilled enough in a certain area, such as for example Military, Elodie can unlock a Military outfit that boosts said skill a little.\n\nAs stated, strategy will be involved as Elodie's skills heavily affects how the story plays out. For example, there is a part where Elodie is given a box of chocolate that is poisoned. Depending on certain skills, Elodie will either know it is poisoned, or she will have the patience to leave it for later (in which a steward steals it, leading to his death). Lacking any of these, means you aren't even given the option to not eat the chocolate as Elodie will be too eager to feel the sweet taste of soon-to-be-death.\nThis is why it is also a bunch of trial-and-error: Your first time playing, you're not going to know what's coming at you; eventually you'll slowly progress and remember what events are coming ahead in which you can plan stratetic mood alterings to help you level up the skills needed to pass the events.\n\nIt's a very calm and fun game that I can recommend to people who want something really simple.\nNot recommended for the faint of heart who can't read about Elodie dying in many different ways...\n","February 25, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not. At all.\n\nThe better way to describe this game's genre is as a roguelike RPG visual novel. And that distinction makes a ton of difference.\n\nThe reason it's a roguelike is because you are stuck with the consequences of your actions. There's no  going back. No re-assigning points (which you get from the RPGish training system within the game). You make choices and you can die. Permanently. In fact there are many different ways to die, some of which are very hard to find and you have to try for.\n\nThere's a brutalism here that is tempered by comedy. Some of the situations and things happening are absurd, and the game recognizes that. But it's also totally unforgiving. You can't win a sword fight if you've never trained with a sword. But you can use your magic skills to just blast a sword-wielding opponent away. This blend of campy and fun and serious all at the same time really sets the tone for the game.\n\nI replayed it repeatedly after finally beating it the first time, just for fun. And also to try to explore all the other branches that I missed the first time around. It's rewarding, engrossing, and I ended up spending way more time on this game than I ever thought I would.\n\nThe achievements unlock in weird ways: some of them won't register until you've attained it, then quit the game, then restarted it. I don't know why but it can be confusing and frustrating when you think you unlocked something but it doesn't pop.\n\nMy biggest complaint is really with the beginning of the game: there are only a few paths that work to get you past the early pitfalls. It would be nice if there were more variety in how you could handle those situations. But it's kind of the nature of the beast: since all your skills start at zero it inevitably takes time to build them up to be anything useful.\n\nThere are also some skills that almost never come up. Animal handling? They might be pivotal for a single check in the entire game. It would've been nice if they were replaced with something more interesting, or just used more.\n\nSo if you want a unique, fun experience where you play a teenage queen trying to run a medieval country, complete with noble plots, wars, romance, and magic, then look no further.","May 14, 2015","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this royalty simulator, you control Elodie, a precocious little pink-haired 14-year-old princess who, upon her mother's death, has been thrust into the role of matriarch. Establishing this game firmly in the G.R.R. Martin school of political thought, your goal is not so much to save the world from evil or to rule as a beloved queen should, but to survive long enough to reach your coronation.\n\nYour country is weak, your neighbors ambitious, and your education incredibly limited; spend your time training up the many, many skills you'll need to be an effective leader, juggling pressing needs for the kingdom with personal desires to help you get what you want. Meanwhile, the constant flood of events around you will send your emotions scattering all over, and since it's hard to study Military Strategy when you're terrified or Court Manners when you're feeling defiant, you must manage your personal time to keep you in the right state of mind. On top of all that, you'll be asked time and again to commit money or military strength to a number of causes; until you've trained up the proper understanding of economics and military theory, you won't even be aware these resources exist, let alone that they're something you should be mindful of. Screw up along the way and you're dead - assassins, poisoned gifts, bandits, monsters... There are plenty of horrible things out to get you. And they will. Repeatedly. It's a surprisingly anxiety-ridden pile of disasters to manage, and while I adore it, your mileage may vary.\n\nOn top of that, there's also a decent story set behind everything, though your point of view limits what you can see. The cast of characters is overwhelming at first, but you quickly start to remember which ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s backstabbed you and which actually seem to be decent enough human beings. There are plenty of story paths to follow, plenty of branches that reveal details otherwise hidden, and plenty of endings to grab. Are you a meek and pretty trophy wife? A blood-stained military empress? A strange and terrifying witch-queen? Bear the demands of the throne, squeeze what you want out of the spare time you are given, and you can forge whatever destiny you so choose.","November 13, 2013","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, beyond the art and the stat raising, Long Live the Queen and Princess Maker 2 don't really have that much in common. Both involve some level of strategy, but Long Live the Queen eschews the more exploratory bits for a more visual novel style. This is a game about courtly intrigue and trying to survive, and you will probably die multiple times before finally reaching your coronation day.\nI've heard complaints that there's little replay value, and while the game is short, it's impossible to get all the skill checks in one go, and getting certain skill checks can open up whole storylines or reveal bits of the plot that you wouldn't see if you hadn't chosen to raise that stat.

You will die a lot, as a result of failing checks that seem to come out of nowhere. However, if you push through this and keep replaying you'll find an incredibly rewarding game waiting for you. It's a great feeling to finally pass a high level check for the first time, and seeing Elodie finally make it to her coronation is the best!\n\nOne thing I do wish is that there were an option to reread all the lessons Elodie learned so far on a given playthrough. It'd make it easier to catch foreshadowing, get a fuller sense of the world when you can read lessons which inform each other back to back instead of with potentially weeks of gameplay between them, and (when replaying) to realize that you've forgotten to do anything for a check that's coming up.\n\nI'd recommend playing through your first time or two just picking whatever you'd like and seeing what happens, but after that here are a couple tips:\nOkay, one tip for your very first playthrough: Don't keep chasing checks that have already passed! By that I mean a LOT of people have the instinct when they see a failed stat check to go "Oh no! Let's focus only on that stat for the next few weeks so I'll never fail with it again!" You'll see this happen in blind let's plays of the game all the time, and it's a good way to get Elodie dead.\nRead the flavor text you get with your classes! Not only is foreshadowing and worldbuilding hidden there, if you see the description for one lesson mention something you'd need a different type of class to use effectively that's probably the game waving at you yelling "Hey! I'm gonna check for these back-to-back at some point!\nHave an idea going in of what you want to accomplish. There is not enough time in the game to get skilled enough to pass every high-level check, so just pick a couple things you want to do and only worry about them. (Well, them plus surviving, obviously.)\nBy that same measure, don't feel pressured into getting your Lumen crystal just because the game keeps bringing it up! There is never once in the game that you NEED to use magic without any other way around it, so if there's some event you're focused on getting don't feel like you need to get sidetracked into pumping up your presence or accounting skills.\nHaving high enough intrigue by a point near the midgame will let you pick something you want your agents to focus on protecting you from. Whichever you pick can save you from one possible failure state later on. (More guards, for instance, will bypass the infamous archery/battlefield medicine/composure check.)\nDivination is surprisingly useful, there're multiple points where Elodie will get a hint that can lead her to doing something that'll prove useful later in the game from it. But if you rely on it too much it can also drive you away from interesting plotlines.\nAlmost every failure state in the game has more than one way to avoid it. If you keep banging against one scenario you just can't get all the way through try going back to an old save and seeing if you can find another way through it. Some of the alternate ways can be very satisfying! I love watching Elodie using knowledge of trade route and internal affairs to logic out that something's fishy about the poisoned chocolates.","June 21, 2015","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It takes a lot of strategic thinking to get a good ending, and it's pretty difficult achieving one on your first tries; nonetheless, i found myself quite addicted with it. Even when I wasn't playing, sometimes, I started wondering wich path could I try to avoid death - skills to learn, in what order, choices to make - and that's good, it means the game is entrataining.\n\nThe graphics may look frilly, but it's nice to look at it for long times - considering that you'll spend most of your game time looking at the skill-review screen to decide what to learn. The concept is good, and so is the plot; pretty much everyone could be planning your death, and most of the time you won't even know what you will be facing. The storyline also manages to surprise with sudden twists, so every skill may come handy.  I have already achieved two different endings, but I'll definetly play more to discover new ones.\n\nMoreover, after dying many times, you kinda feel good for the main character when finally you get to the ending xD I figure that once familiar with the mechanics and once used to save and load at specific points of the story, breaking through the endings is surely easier, but that's not a downside, actually.\n\nAll considered, I think this may be a nice choice if you never played anything similar before and you feel you'd like to try.","January 15, 2014","true","29.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The biggest one is the fact that the game is incredibly short. It only lasts about a month, which is by no means enough time to accomplish much. It also gives you way too many skills to raise in such a short amount of time, and considering that there's really only one ending, raising the necessary skills to pass all the skill checks at that point causes your other skills to suffer, which, in turn, causes you to miss out on multiple events due to not having enough points in the right skill. Multiple playthroughs or a walkthrough is needed in order to know what happens when and what skills you need. All that being said, the visual novel style of the game is quite nice and the skills checks do add an interesting gameplay element to the game. In my own personal opinion, though, Princess Maker 2 an older, but better game of similar design that succeeds where LLTQ fails. If you're wanting to try out Long Live The Queen, then by all means do, but I'd wait until it's on sale.","February 8, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In spite of the uber-cute exterior, this is a fairly challenging game. You need to keep track of various skills, Elodie's moods (with can have a fairly heavy impact on a skill you're trying to boost), and the various events and characters you encounter. Also, you can expect to have Elodie die more times than South Park's Kenny and Star Trek's Red Shirt guy combined. Overall, LLtQ has a fair amount of replay value as you try for different outcomes and achievements (or to see how may ways poor Elly meets her untimely demise). Only you will determine if Elodie will become the beloved ruler of Nova or a severely depressed,traumatized and stressed out wreck with more emotional issues than Katawa Shoujo's Hanako Ikezawa.\n\nAs entertaining as the game is, LLtQ does have it's share of flaws. Most notably some parts of the skill check system. Some checks require skills you either will not have early on (Sense Magic for one) or at levels impossible to reach without the debug console. One example is  the weekend event in Week 8 requiring a nearly maxed Sense Magic or skill combinations at 120+ or higher (Lore,Conversation,Presence,Meditation). A slight rebalancing to lower the required levels somewhat and/or having Elodie able to learn Sense Magic without the crystal (natural/ inherited ability) would help here.\n\nAnother would be having a type of "Class System" which would give her more of a background. After all, she attended a boarding school for the children of the nobility and yet has no skills to show for it. Makes you wonder what she was doing there. One way to implement this would be similar to the "G.O.A.T" test from Fallout (series of questions to determine her background) or by selecting the type of school she attended / classes she was interested in or excelled at. Choose a Finishing school for Social and Dance Skills), Military (for Weapons,Military and Intrigue), Academic (Intellectual), Athletic (Agility/Athletics) or Artistic (Expression skills) for a small starting bonus (10-20 pts.).\n\nFinally, this could use an expanded relationship system rather than just depend on the events in the game. A few Tokimeki Memorial / Sentimental Graffiti style date event and gift/letter exchanges with a chosen love interest (male or female) could add some more depth to the game as well.\n\nOverall, in spite of the flaws mentioned, this is an enjoyable game and worth the $8-10 price tag\n\n","December 28, 2013","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But now, after at least six hours of strategizing and four deaths under my belt, I know I was sorely mistaken.\n\nLong Live the Queen is more than your normal cutesy-wootsy Shoujo visual novel, it's actually a quite challenging Simulation RPG based on "leveling" up the skills needed to put Elodie, our much beloved Queen-to-be, on the throne. You will face challenges such as civil war, uprisings against the crown, foreign attacks, assasination attempts, and the making of crucial decisions that could mean life, death, or even disastor for the whole kingdom. Please, I implore you, do not take this game by face value alone, all the pink and frills cover up a fierce strategy game that had all but left me in stressful self-loathing at my own Christmas purchase.\n\nTD;LR: Girly outside, hardcore strategy inside. 9/10 would definitely recommend.","December 18, 2013","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a lot of trial and error involved, and you will most likely die a decent number of times before you reach the actual end. However, unlike in most games where that's annoying, it's pretty fascinating to see all the ways you manage to get yourself killed in this game and what all the different decisions you make can do. There's no voice acting for the game, but the music is quite good. The art is well done. The story is always interesting, and you learn more about this world with every play through and with every different decision you make. The game is highly about strategy and trial and error though, and if that turns you off, I really wouldn't recommend this game. But I can easy see putting a decent amount of time in this game just to see the different paths you can take and what different playing styles will do.","December 15, 2013","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In spite of the uber-cute exterior, this is a fairly challenging game. You need to keep track of various skills, Elodie's moods (with can have a fairly heavy impact on a skill you're trying to boost), and the various events and characters you encounter. Also, you can expect to have Elodie die more times than South Park's Kenny and Star Trek's Red Shirt guy combined. Overall, LLtQ has a fair amount of replay value as you try for different outcomes and achievements (or to see how may ways poor Elly meets her untimely demise). Only you will determine if Elodie will become the beloved ruler of Nova or a severely depressed,traumatized and stressed out wreck with more emotional issues than Katawa Shoujo's Hanako Ikezawa.\n\nAs entertaining as the game is, LLtQ does have it's share of flaws. Most notably some parts of the skill check system. Some checks require skills you either will not have early on (Sense Magic for one) or at levels impossible to reach without the debug console. One example is  the weekend event in Week 8 requiring a nearly maxed Sense Magic or skill combinations at 120+ or higher (Lore,Conversation,Presence,Meditation). A slight rebalancing to lower the required levels somewhat and/or having Elodie able to learn Sense Magic without the crystal (natural/ inherited ability) would help here.\n\nAnother would be having a type of "Class System" which would give her more of a background. After all, she attended a boarding school for the children of the nobility and yet has no skills to show for it. Makes you wonder what she was doing there. One way to implement this would be similar to the "G.O.A.T" test from Fallout (series of questions to determine her background) or by selecting the type of school she attended / classes she was interested in or excelled at. Choose a Finishing school for Social and Dance Skills), Military (for Weapons,Military and Intrigue), Academic (Intellectual), Athletic (Agility/Athletics) or Artistic (Expression skills) for a small starting bonus (10-20 pts.).\n\nFinally, this could use an expanded relationship system rather than just depend on the events in the game. A few Tokimeki Memorial / Sentimental Graffiti style date event and gift/letter exchanges with a chosen love interest (male or female) could add some more depth to the game as well.\n\nOverall, in spite of the flaws mentioned, this is an enjoyable game and worth the $8-10 price tag\n\n","December 28, 2013","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story line is very indepth, and every small choice you make makes a larger impact on the overall story. I have yet to beat this game, and doubt that I will anytime soon, and very much enjoy the many hilarious, and sometimes gruesome deaths that I stumble upon.

The world is fairly interesting to find out about and I've enjoyed trying to predict the skills I'm going to need.  It's definately a game that only has a limited amount of interesting gameplay, due to the fact that the story / events are very linear.  That said, it appears to have a lot of branching elements to it, which should give enough content to make it interesting for a while at least.\n\nThe art is something you are either going to hate or love... I for one enjoy the overal 'cute' factor of the art when it is coupled with a lot of the sometimes very dark themes happening in the game.\n\nI will say that it feels like it's going to be awhile and a challenge to actually get Princess Elodie to make it to her coronation alive though.\n\nUltimately, if you find the entire concept of a japanese style visual novel boring, this game won't change that opinion at all.  However, if you have even a slight interest or curiosity about the genre, this could be a pretty fun look in to that world.","December 28, 2013","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even so, I wasn't sure if that would be all there was to it. After playing the game for a a bit, I'm happy to say that it isn't.\n\nBehind those cutesy graphics is an impressive engine based on the RenPy framework. The gameplay centers around a round-based stats system which is simple to grasp but provides some room for experimentation. This is combined with a well-written branching visual novel with options that vary based on how you build your princess. The interplay of the stats and story makes for an enjoyably addictive experience.\n\nI recommend it even if you don't normally enjoy the extremes of the dress-up simulator/spreadsheet game genre spectrum. It's a happy medium that should appeal to a wide audience.","December 21, 2013","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This makes it a case of Trial & Error gameplay, or Guide Dang It.\n\nI would call it "Baby's first Princess Maker" but actually, the tone is a lot darker.

If you take art into consideration, this game has very cute and colorful characters, albeit its backgrounds are reused constantly.\n2. It's a lot of fun gathering up all the achievements. There's definitely enough to keep you busy and get your money's worth out of the game.\n3. There's separate endings, all of which are effected by even small choices during gameplay.\n\nCons:\n\n1. This game takes a little while to beat. You might want to save each turn, or be prepared to start from the beginning.\n2. While the many skills the protagonist can have are interesting and fun, it could be frustrating for some trying to pass all of the "tests" each skill has. Whether or not you can feasibly beat all the tests, I don't know.\n3. It can be frustrating at times to encounter an event that you need to complete to beat the game, yet you haven't gathered the required skills.\n\nOverall it's a nice game, worth playing more than once.

There is close calls, and forced (not arranged) marriges. Most are for titles and money. Also, so far I've only found there to be 1 happy ending out of the many depressing ones. Strangly, there hasn't been much talk about how her father puts everything on her, and tells her to take care of it, while he sits on throne after a few week into the game. The game can cause frusteration, since there are many impossible things to achieve.\nNow for the good sides. It's not perverted in the slightest. The music, gameplay, abilities, are all spectacular. There are many routes and possiblites. It's girly on the outside, but if you ignore the child-like art and pink, it's a pretty gruesome game. It can be gory in words more than image.

Similar to the Princess Maker games from Japan, the goal of the game is to aid Princess Elodie into Queendom so that she can continue looking after the realm. You do this by making decisions for Elodie and deciding which classes she should attend (2 per week) in order to polish her into a tru gem. Of course, it's not as simple as that.\n\nThe story has multiple endings and many twists and turns which often evolve in the death of our dear Elodie. Commoner uprisings, magical wars and coups are all parts of what you have to avoid running into whilst hoping that along the way someone doesn't try and trick Elodie into eating poisoned chocolates.\n\nThe game is fun with a lot of decisions but can get frustrating after seeing Elodie stumble at the same hurdle over and over again. Gameplay is literally using a mouse to pick decisions but the interactivity of the story makes up for it. The additional clothes for Elodie are a nice touch. If you're an achievement hunter there are plenty of achievements to be found, and as there are different storylines there's a lot of replaying that can be done with satisfyig conclusions. Towards the end when you have almost 100% it can get tedious going through the same story again and again, however.\n\nOverall this game is great in any collection and not just for girls. :) Long live the Queen!","November 8, 2014","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If somebody told me I would spend over 15 hours playing this game I would not believe it. This is a visual novel which means that you basicly play through a story making descisions along the way changing up the story everytime you play it through (which can take between 10-40 minutes). Depending on the path you take you will lead to different endings and a lot of them being... your death.\n\nThroughout the game you will level up different traits, depending on what you choose to focus on different part of the stories will be easier for you to complete and changes your possible paths. If you fail a test it's not the end of the world unless... you die. And even if death comes a lot and often and forces you to restart it's acutally not frustrating, instead it works as a motivator to play differently next time.\n\nWith every restart you want to know what happens if you level different traits, completing a trait test you didn't complete the last time. For example, if I become a animal trainer will my pet dog become a great strong guard dog? Or will I be able to tame animals throughout the story? You want to know!\n\nI do understand this game is not for everyone, if you're not a fan of slow/reading heavy games you probably dont want to get this. But if you get a chance to try it, DO SO. Suprisingly fun and of course you want to collect every possible DEATH achievement...\n\nRecommended!\n\n/ Nurgleprobe","January 12, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, the truth is that Long Live The Queen offers an incredibly fresh gaming experience. Part visual novel, part choose your own adventure, part rpg and part tamgotchi, though the sum is greater than the parts.\n\nYou guide princess Elody from the time her mother's death forces her to leave boarding school up to the moment she's crowned. If you get there that is. In spite of the cheerful graphics and beautiful music this game has a brutal difficulty. You make the wrong choice? -> you die, you haven't got several skills up to snuff? -> one dead princess, you kill off a troublesome noble? -> her son runs Elody through.\n\nEvery choice you make has consequences and the sheer gigantic amount of things that could (and probably will) go wrong is staggering. Yet as daunting as it makes the task, it's damn fun to try it. Additional fun comes in the form of the death scenes which (though presented in a cute way) are reminiscent of those found in Shadowgate.\n\nSo, what are you still reading for?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rainbowchiffon/recommended/251990/","rainbowchiffon","madame fujoshé","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rainbowchiffon/","50 products in account","“Long Live the Queen” is a life simulation game that’s reminiscent towards games like “Princess Maker” in Japan.\n\nPrimarily, the main goal is to have Elodie, the princess that the player has to “raise” and help her survive wars, potential threats, and ward off unwanted suitors before she could become queen at fifteen years old, who is considered as a legal adult in this time period.\n\nThere are different classes Elodie could take – such as, conversations, royal demeanor, animal handling, history, economics, faith, military, athletics, agility, and much much more! The more classes she takes, the more her skills will rise. The more her skills rise, the better she can understand certain conversations to progress the story along. Of course, it’s completely up to the player on what kind of queen Elodie could be just based on the choices made alone. There really isn’t an end to the choices to choose from!\n\nOne of the main things that brings people to this game is not just what kind of queen she would be but if she’s going to survive long enough to become a queen. There are various ways to die in this game and each one is actually part of the achievements – which is a unique thing about it since most games would try to prevent that from happening.\n\nThere is a way to avoid dying, of course, but the player has to make sure that her skill set for certain actions are pretty much almost completely filled up.\n\nAnother unique thing about this game is the mood system. For every mood that she is, there’s a penalty and there’s a bonus. Certain moods help boost up skills for whatever class the player chooses for her and others, well, not so much. There’s actually a penalty if the player makes Elodie take the wrong classes for a certain mood she’s in.\n\nThere are outfits the player can unlock, so long as that particular subject is pretty well-balanced. These outfits help boost up that particular subject, especially if she’s in a war, a tournament, or at the gala, although more often than not, they’re just there to change up from her boarding school uniform.\n\nIf Elodie does manage to survive to coronation, there are epilogues afterwards based on the choices that the player makes. They’re the literal result of what happens based on the player’s choices and decisions as a young fourteen year old girl trying to become a Queen.\n\nNot only does the epilogues come in what happened to Elodie and her subjects (if they’re involved in any way), but they come in beautiful drawings that’s similar to stained glass on the castle walls.\n\nBut what do I think of it? I really enjoyed it! It’s a lot of fun and it’s fun to try to get the different endings and different deaths. There’s actually a checklist within the game itself to try to get all the achievements, deaths, and different epilogue stained glasses to try to vary the game experience up.\n\nWhile it does seem that the endings are endless, there are a few problems.\n\nGoing over the game over and over, eventually, it starts to become extremely repetitive. Sometimes new menus and new choices pop up which could lead to different endings/results but eventually, the player might have to pass by that same choice and those same scenes again just to get to the choices that the player has to deviate from.\n\nIt’s a little bit of a bore but there is the option to skip the text so it’s really not that bad. Once new text pops up, though, it stops so the player can read it. There is the option to go back and re-do the choices but it doesn’t work all the time, so be sure you know what you’re doing in terms of choices.\n\nThe writing for the political intrigue is pretty basic for a life simulation game but, honestly, I’m not sure if that’s really a complaint or not. On one hand, the player would know exactly what to do in a situation such as that and it’d seem exactly as it is: too easy to figure out. On the other hand, it does give the player an opportunity to go back and do the other choice just for the fun of it and just to see what happens. It’s not really hard to get invested in what’s going on in Nova, the land this takes place in, but it’s just as easy not to.\n\nThe art is a hit or a miss for me. The character designs are simple, but one of the characters, Julianna the Duchess of Ursul, reminds me almost completely of Sailor Mercury of “Sailor Moon”. It’s a little distracting.\n\nThe backgrounds for the game are fine but, again, tend to be simple since the backgrounds don’t seem to change that often. There are places Elodie can go during the weekend, but there’s not a real immersion factor here although I’m sure that’s probably not intended.\n\nOften, it’s hard to determine how old the characters are (especially the older gentleman who sends Elodie a necklace, customary for betrothal) but it’s clear when they’re supposed to be young though it’s hard discerning whether they’re a teenager or not if one isn’t paying attention to the dialogue.\n\nMore often than not, there’s almost unfinished feel with it. Granted, this game isn’t really meant to be something completely serious and, again as I mentioned before, it’s easy to not get as invested in it since there’s achievements for deaths. If you didn’t get the ending you want, it’s not like the game’s going to punish you – you’ll probably get an achievement out of it instead which could be beneficial if that’s what the player wanted.\n\nThe music for the game fits it although maybe not the splash song. It’s a piano version of “God Save the Queen”, the British national anthem but the rest of the game’s music is fine. Of course, if the player doesn’t want the music, they could always turn it off in the preferences.\n\nAs for the intrigue of Elodie’s mother’s demise, it’s pretty cut and dried. Based on the story itself when I got there, it’s so throwaway that her mother being dead might as well not have mattered.  From the way they alluded her mother’s death, I thought that this would finally get some deep stuff about the Lumens and why this world is the way it is (sort of modern but still in past fantasy/medieval) but it didn’t really end up that way, so that was disappointing.\n\nPerhaps it’s best that way though – if the entirety for the game is simple, there really isn’t any rhyme or reason why anything else would be more important than anything else. If there is any real intrigue, it’s about some of the preferences the dukes and duchesses have for company. Other than that, there’s no real intrigue. As mentioned over and over, this is pretty much cut & dried. It’s a simple story for a simple game about simply raising a princess named Elodie who may or may not become queen.\n\nIt’s a fun ride, despite it all, and it certainly does have replay value even after the 100% achievements (epilogues, deaths, & achievements) have been unlocked. It’s not too deep and the art is cute although some people probably wouldn’t like it too much if they’re looking for a simulation with some depth to it. It is a fun game, though, and I’d recommend this to those who just want to try different things without worrying too much about the princess they’re trying to raise.","February 17, 2015","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The backstory is well written as is the lore for the kingdom and the realm which you are thrown into as a young princess. The objective of the game is simply survival, with underlying themes related to the affairs of the realm. It manages to keep these politics interesting as it mixes humor, creative storytelling and a broad array of options for the player to decide the princess' fate.  The gameplay of this game involves making choices, most of these choices revolve around what you choose to study, as well as what options you select in dialogue, these two aspects decide your survival.The bad however is that some of the methods of avoiding death or decisions made based on lack of research (studying) are nonsense, although this does add a degree of humor and certain attributes are favored for survival. Additionally despite the broad selection of choices, many of which lead to premature death, there is a very limited survival route, meaning as you replay the game you end up following the same path to progress as certain progressions in terms of events are linear. That makes the first playthrough the best experience with this game, with diminishing returns. The game duration is only a couple hours depending on how successful you are at navigating through the game. I recommend this game conditionally if you enjoy choose your own ending style visual novels or text adventures, otherwise it likely won't appeal to you.","May 9, 2014","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I think that's enough game time to write a review!\n\nTHIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUN. I love it! I love trying out different skills and making different decisions. I've unlocked 5 achievements so far, but I haven't reached the coronation level yet. But I will get there eventually! It's a lot of fun for me to figure out where certain skills lead me, and to figure out which decision is going to keep me alive. I still have lots of work to do to unlock all the achievements and all the epilogues, but I look forward to it all!","January 23, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When even though it angers and infuriates you, you still keep coming back for more and that's exactly what this game does. As of yet I have died many times from various things that seem innocent at the time but killed me later and every time I only get more furious with the game, for example please tell me how a Decoration skill matters in a magical duel to the death? But it's also for this reason that the game is so good, there are so many interlocking events that you will find yourself eager to replay it again and again with each time trying a new method to see how far it gets you. To put it in perspective there are so many skills and events that the game's wiki couldn't make a walkthrough of it. This game will make you embrace your inner paranoia and I loved it.\n\nPros:\nExtreme replayability\nEvery action has a consequence\nDifferent and interactive storylines\nTreats player as intelligent\nThrows the player right into the game\nExtremely good fun\n\nCons:\nSoundtrack could have flowed better with the game\nOutfits for the character were kind of annoying\nSome of the deaths and skills were frustrating (the Decoration example to name one)\nConfusingly large number of characters.\nNever explains what mood affects each skill\nSteep learning curve\n\nFinal verdict: Worth a buy  8/10\nLong Live The Queen!","April 4, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThusVoiD/recommended/251990/","ThusVoiD","ThusVoiD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThusVoiD/","159 products in account","A very good Visual Novel adventure! If you are unfamiliar with the genre it is heavily story driven, you can think of it like a flow chart that changes direction with every action you take - which effects the environment and how characters will continue to interact with you. Also sometimes actions you make during the game effect you later on. All combined, it provides rich replay-value as you can keep making different choices to receive alternate story line paths and endings.\n\nMaybe you will become an evil dictator? Do you fall in love? What are your feelings on war? And what about that whole princess thing, do you embrace it or carve out your own path - the choices are all up to you.\n\nLong Live The Queen has a unique system I've yet to see elsewhere, which is you have skills that require proficiency. Depending on your mood skills get modifiers (positive and negative), effecting how quickly they level up. So while you are juggling character interactions you also have to manage your mood, while figuring out what type of skillset to aim for. This system adds an immense amount of depth and realism. Unlike in other games where you can do many bad or immoral things throughout the game and then choose your ending based on A,B,C. In LLTQ once you commit to a life style choice, it is very hard to back out - the future is shaped by the past.\n\nThe only down side is there is a lot of reading. Many of the finer details are described through text instead of graphics. There are visual clues on the emotional state of characters, but outside of that it is like reading a book. Personally I did not find this a problem, but I felt it was important to mention.\n\nOverall I recommend this game to those who are a fan of the genre or have an open mind when it comes to gaming.","March 27, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

So one round (=until your death) was nicely short and one could play it every now and then. But sure, I got addicted to find the way to survive and it took rather long for me to make poor Elodie to survive until her coronation day.\n\nSo yeah, I suppose I kinda liked it.

Expect a challenge.  Extremely highly recommend at full price.\n\nFull review:\nINTRODUCTION\nI have been considering this game for a while before getting it, finally picked it up in the best humble bundle I purchased yet for this game alone.  Do not be offput by the general public brushing it off as a dating sim, that is (or should I say can be) such a tiny aspect of the game I don't even really consider it while I play.\n\nSO WHAT IS THE GAME ABOUT?\nThis game is about the struggles of a young girl about to become queen, as it says in the description.  Morethan that though, this game is about how your every move and decision is constantly changing and effecting the world around you creating hilarious, tragic, unexpected, and moving ways to live or die at every turn.  Atfirst the game will seem quite simple, but after your third, fourth, fifth....... death, you will realize just how deep the game can go.  The game's events are generally in a particular order, but those can change and diverge greatly and quickly based on what you choose.\n\nTHE GOOD\nChoices and meaning.  This game does an excellent job of portraying not only that your choices mattered, but what each one actually meant.  This is extremely empowering to the player.  On the flipside, situations beyond your control, not because the game is unfair, but because of a choice you made... or didn't make, happen frequently and keep you on your toes.  You can feel like a god wielding magic user with all the military knowledge in the world, feel unstoppable as you crush armies with your will alone, but what happens when you get an unexpected gift?  Do you really know what it means?\n\nTHE BAD\nSoundtrack.  That's about it.  It's a repetitive set of canned classical masterpieces in lovely midi form.  Beynd that, as long as you realize this is a text game where immersion relies on your imagination instead of clunky controls and flashy graphics, you won't have any huge issues.\n\nTHE INDIFFERENT\nAs far as things which I don't find good or bad, but worth bringing up there are two.  First is the artwork.  I personally find it well done, but not my favorite style.  All the male characters are to "kawaii" and some of the outfits are just silly, like a catsuit with a monocle.  Second is the difficulty.  While I welcome a challange, the game doesn't really lend itself to constant "save states" and it's usually better to start over every time you die.  While some people may not like the difficulty, I feel indifferent as the starting over is annoying since the first few events will be the same, but after that it is fun to see how the tiny change in your first 3 weeks completely changes the feel of the game.\n\nIT'S FINALLY OVER\nIn closing, this is one of the best story driven games I have ever played.  I seek out games like this, such as A Dark Room (iOS), Indigo Prophecy / Heavy Rain (must play games for those who like story), and many other, less noteworthy titles.  Out of all of them though, this one may not be the absolute best, but it does do the absolute best job at giving the player power within the story, without giving the player power to control it like a god (I'm looking at you Indigo Prophecy).","February 13, 2015","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
