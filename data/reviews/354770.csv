You shoot, you avoid enemies, their shots and you upgrade yourself (your hp is included here). The game forces you to get good or you won't get very far since taking damage is penalized severely since you either spend your skill points improving or healing yourself.\n\nPlays somewhat like a roguelike in that you only got one live but there are savepoints so it's not too harsh, You may find that replaying some sections to be optimal as you learn the enemies and their patterns so you can conserve as much health as possible otherwise you not only lose out on upgrades but will have to sacrifice enhancements for your hp and that just sets you up for that much of a tougher end game and may force you to restart your game altogether if it gets too bad.\n\nSo... genre fans and those that are intrigued by the concept be sure to give the game a go at the regular price or wait for a sale if you are patient or not altogether in any hurry whatsoever to play it.","January 15","true","1.6"," 37 of 37 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","37","37","0","0"

You must go through the flying city of Pithia killing all the monsters that roam the city with your "Kuna Musket". As you run through the city, you find collectibles, modifications for your musket and other stuff. The game is currently in early access and since the developer is adding a bunch of content he turned saves off, so I couldn't make it too far into the game as of the time of this review going up.\n\nPositives:\n+Great sort of rich dark art style.\n+Very nice models.\n+Pretty original proof of concept.\n+Nice back story.\n+Collectibles and modifications rewarded for exploring the levels.\n+Cool enemies and bosses.\n+Nice sound effects.\n+Interesting mechanics.\n+Low price.\n+Friendly responsive developer (Some people can argue that this is not really an important thing, but I think it is).\n+Good controls.\n+Very low price.\n\nNegatives:\n-A few bugs here and there, nothing major though.\n-Some sound effects are missing.\n-This city feels more like a bunch of levels, I wish the game would more flow through and let you have some freedom to explore this flying city, but it's more of just a bunch of levels you can teleport through.\n-No voice acting, and there is a lot of reading to do which some people find annoying to do.\n-Levels are very similar to each other, just different colours.\n\nOverall I rate this game a  7/10 . This is a fun game overall but it is quiet linear and there are some parts missing, the developer is working very hard on this game and I think it's worth buying to see this game develop and to support the developer to manage to do that!\n\n*This review will be updated when the game fully releases.*","June 3, 2015","true","9.9"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","29","34","0","0"

Rare enough is it for a game in Early Access to actually get finished, it’s even rarer for that game to get better over time. It’s even rarer still that the game has character and a developer behind it who clearly loves their product. Whilst it can be beaten in less than two hours, it will take much longer than that to learn how to do it in that time. And if you get into it, there’s even leaderboards for highest scores and largest combos. All this and for well under USD $10, you really should give Trigger Saint a good look in, if you’re able to handle having your ♥♥♥ handed to you time and time again!\n\n8.9/10\n\nSee full review here: http://www.shoddypixels.com/trigger-saint-review/\n\nSee original Early Access piece here: http://www.shoddypixels.com/indie-focus-trigger-saint/","May 9, 2015","true","8.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

Watching this game evolve during Alpha testing stage was awesome. You can see the Developer is putting a lot of effort into making the game better day by day.\nOnce again it is a great game and I highly it for you!\n\nThings I like about this game:\n-hand drawn artwork - The developer has done an incredible job. The artwork looks stunning great!\n\n-interesting backstory - That's something you need to read from the game information to get an idea what the story is about and then play the game to uncover more of the story.\n\n-Cooperation with Community based on it's feedback - This is something the most of present day game developers miss. But not Undergroundies Games. The developer is having some serious talking with community about new in-game features as well as finding bugs and fixing them.\n\nThings I don't like about this game:\n\nThis section doesn't need anything to be written in it.\n\nPERSONAL RATING: 9/10","May 1, 2015","true","7.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","13","18","3","0"

I still have more to beat, and for the price of the game it is super worth it. Even if this game cost $100, I would still buy it after the great experience I have had so far. If I find someone wrong, or even that I think should be tweaked a little, I tell the dev and he patches it immediately. He is the only early access dev that actually listens to the players. I've played for 27 hours, and still haven't beat the game! And, he is still adding levels! So if you buy this game you can expect a long gameplay, beautiful art, great levels, and a great side story. I've bought it, and so should you.\n10/10 - ManyAlpacas","May 2, 2015","true","51.4"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","14","21","4","0"

I've been with the game since the demo on gameMaker: studio. This game rocks! I love it! (still not a big fan of the perma-death though)\n\nThe things I love:\n-The soundtrack\n-the artwork. It's hand-drawn and amazing.\n-the lore. It's interesting and pretty unique.\n\nThe things I don't love\n-the perma-death. This is only because I'm bad at this game though\n\n*edit: Another great thing is how involved the deve is in the communtiry of his game. He is very open to suggestion and is a great guy.

Even through you have only two attacks, mods and destructible  scenery keep combat interesting. Only issues I have had is that non-combat enemies do lots of damage and life is very scarce. The fact that areas inbetween save points are very long only make getting hit by something you can't fight back against even more punishing. I hope the devs can balance the damage of these enemies as I think they are a little to strong during the early game.","September 12, 2015","true","4.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
