It's a bit clunky, but then again it's an old game. Everything about this game screams 10/10. But because it's in the Warhammer universe, I'm rating it 40,000/40,000.\n\nGet this game.

Dawn of War offers economics, base building, military tactics, and unit management.\n\nStory:\nDawn of War, the first installment on an incredible Warhammer 40,000 saga. The game is based on the planet Tarturus where Ork forces are out of control ravaging the planet and destroying Imperial Guard moral; but, how are they winning so easily? Of course the forces of Chaos are behind the whole war. Dawn of War is the story of Gabrial Angelos and Isador Akios and how they work together to figure out the whole reason behind the presence of Chaos on the imperial garrison at Tarturus.\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign offers an epic tale into the 40k lore with amazing twists and turns around every mission. Coupled with the amazing combat system, base management, and resource management this game really packs a punch. The campaign is divided into eleven missions which put you to the test fighting against the Orc Horde and the Chaos Might. As you progress through the campaign you work with the Eldar to defeat a common foe, but as the game dictates the Enemy of your Enemy is not always your friend. The game pits teams together, but at the same time continually draws them apart.\n\nGameplay:\nThis game was one of the first to successfully introduce rapid base expansion by requiring players to capture strategic points, which give the player a trickle of endless resources over time. The fast paced gameplay coupled with the macro and micro unit management really made this game a force to be reckoned with. Although the unit population seems rather low (20 personal – 10 vehicle) because the units are based in squads the real unit count is much higher. The battles seem more like full scale wars with you gripping to manage all your units at once. The best feature of this game (and all the Dawn of War games) is that each team is completely different. They have different units, different buildings, upgrades, tactics, resource types, hero units, and strategies. For example the Orc play completely different from the Eldar while both the Eldar and Orcs play completely different from the Space Marines and Chaos Marines. The only two similar teams are the Space Marines and Chaos marines which offer a good learners curve to Dawn of War by giving providing a basic approach to strategy: build barracks, build turrets for defense, use main base to upgrade to new “age” to receive better buildings, build power plants to get power, and upgrade units within armory, etc.\n\nTeams:\nThere are four teams: Space Marines, Eldar, Orcs, and Chaos Marines. Each team poses different tactics/strategic elements which make you play them differently. The Orcs are based more around unit massing and rapid base expansion. While the Eldar are more about unit specialization and micro base management. The Space Marines and Chaos Marines are essentially the same team set, and fit between tactics of the Orcs and Eldar. Each of the teams units have upgradeable attributes which customize them for specific purposes: weapons, additional squad members, and squad leader units. Each team has special commander units which can be used as heroes buffing the team and supporting military units.\n\nResults:\nAll and all Dawn of War is a must get game. If you can play older games without constantly yearning for the graphics of the modern day games then you’ll enjoy this game. The gameplay is not outdated, but rather refreshing. As it seems most strategy game developers have diverted from base building, resource management, and mass scale war to simple micromanagement tactic games. I loved this game and all the installments so much I repurchased them all on steam. Despite that I still have all the discs, in functional condition, right next to me.\n\nPros:\n+Economic, Base building, and macro unit management\n+Fantastic story and campaign (which is very rare in a strategy game)\n+Amazing teams which each play completely differently.\n+Fast paced gameplay which requires expansion to acquire resource nodes (but those nodes do not run out like in most games)\n+Unit customization allows you to create squads for specific tasks\n+Fantastic computer AI that puts you to your wits\n\nCons:\n-Cannot play this game while having another monitor running (if you have two monitors the game will launch but every time you move the mouse to the edge of the screen where your monitor extends the mouse exits the game as if you are playing in Windowed mode).\n-Lots of unbalances (don’t worry they fix all of these in the later installments)","February 23, 2014","true","22.4"," 97 of 102 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","97","102","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/4570/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Dawn of War is a fantastic modern RTS that measures up very well against the greats in the genre like Starcraft and Age of Empires. It takes place in the Warhammer 40k universe but manages to appeal to players who aren't familiar with the tabletop or lore such as myself.\n\nDawn of War unlike most "older" rts games isn't focused on building or resource gathering. You gain resources automatically through capturing "strategic points" around the map and stealing them from other players. This encourages exploring the map and assaulting other players very quickly early on. Building is also done very early on so the majority of what you spend your time on is creating units and attacking players.\n\nCombat in Dawn of War is done very well. Because there's very little micromanagement with resources and buildings you spend most of the game creating squads, upgrading those squads with different weapons and assaulting the enemy. Each of the 4 races are familiar but different enough so that you'll quickly pick out a favorite among them. Dawn of War's greatest asset is speed, games go by very quickly and you are always getting rewarded for the smallest of accomplishments like capturing strategic points. Which stack up greatly as the game goes on. There are also a lot of little details to the game like how Space Marine buildings are generated by being dropped from orbit.\n\nThe real unfortunate aspect about this release (The original Game of the Year edition) is it's arguably the one I'd recommend the least. It only contains four of the core races (Space Marines, Eldar, Chaos Space Marines and Orks) along with a fairly lackluster Blood Ravens campaign. I still do recommend getting it since it does introduce you to the mechanics of the game very well, and those races do port over to the multiplayer of the subsequent expansions. But by itself the Game of the Year edition isn't as impressive as Winter Assault or Dark Crusade.","October 6, 2015","true","14.9"," 71 of 75 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","71","75","5","1"

I remember my brother pre-ordering  it, and he introduced me into the Universe, and I spent many years watching him play DoW. A few years later, I managed to get my hands on the great title, having been handed down a little beast of a PC ( or had been at the time anyway), and it was my first chance to unleash the power of the Space Marines unto those nasty orks, and the heretic forces of chaos. It was a 3 disk installation, and about a 3 hour wait ; before the game was properly onto the PC. It was well worth it, and the expansions that came out along the years added to the mayhem, it was all part of the experience. I stopped playing DoW as I got rid of my computer, as it was well outdated, and then I suppose it got forgotten in time.\n\nNow back in present day, I became a part of the Steam community, and thought id dig around the room for some games I could add to steam. I found this little gem on my top shelf, so I thought I would give it a go and enter the cd key into steam, I was awfully excited! Put it onto my little laptop, 30 minute installation and I was away, ( so much for those 3 hours installs eh). It all came back to me when I started playing it once again, the music, the classic call of the space marines charging into battle. Me chanting “Burn The Heretic!”, while my Space Marines shoot the hell out of a squad of Chaos marines. Yes, all those requirements of a great RTS game, with hours and hours of enjoyment. You cannot go wrong with good old Dawn Of War, or rather i cannot anyway. The graphics may be quite outdated, and the multiplayer doesn’t hold much of a feature in the game nowadays,  however that certainly does not hinder any enjoyment at all.  Fan of the Wh40k Universe? Used to own the game, but not sure whether to return to serve the emperor? I recommend purchasing this game, and having a whole lot of fun playing it! I personally have a great deal of more of hours to enjoy on this game, reliving the moments of destruction and chaos.\n\nIn terms of gameplay elements, Dawn Of War still does not fail to be a very fun, and a practically great game. 10 Years Later And It Sure As Hell Keeps On Giving!\nOverall:\n\n+ Everything a classic RTS needs\n+ Clever resource system\n+ Immersive campaign to sink many hours into\n+ Must buy for Warhammer 40k fans\n+ Still great at 10 years of age\n\n- Multiplayer servers not great\n- Outdated Graphics\n- Minor bugs\n\nSolid 9/10\n\nThat goes it for my short Dawn of War Steam Review.\n\nThanks,\n\nThe-Sentinel-Gamer","June 28, 2014","true","52.5"," 64 of 68 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","64","68","0","4"

Sometimes it is the awkward transition from movie to videogame. Other times it is the even more awkward transition from videogame to movie. However, every once in a while a franchise weathers the change well, some might argue better off because of the move. The Warhammer 40,000 universe, deftly crafted by the folks at Games Workshop, has attempted the move to videogames before, meeting with varying levels of success. However, it is truly Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War that has made video game players aware of the tabletop brand.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is a real-time-strategy title that recreates the epic tabletop battles of the Warhammer 40k universe, almost perfectly, on your PC. Epic is truly the best word to describe some of these battles as Space Marines and Imperial Guard do their best to hold off the war hungry Orks, the mysterious Eldar, and destroy the twisted forces of Chaos. Dawn of War does an excellent job of staying true to the source material, both in story and gameplay. Specifically, the gameplay for DoW has shifted the focus from individual troops to squads of soldiers. Morale of these squads also plays a role in how combat plays out with "broken" squads becoming significantly less effective until they can regroup.\n\nJust as special characters also play a large role in the tabletop game, they make a significant impact on your Dawn of War army. Force Commanders, Librarians, Sergeants, and Apothecaries can all be attached to your Space Marine squads to imbue them with additional powers and improved combat skills. Access to these characters, as well as certain types of buildings, research topics, and vehicles is granted through a construction tree that will be instantly recognizable to anyone that has ever played a RTS game. That is one of the great things about Dawn of War, it is, at once, both familiar and new.\n\nAs the heir apparent to the StarCraft legacy, Dawn of War had some large shoes to fill. Fortunately, it didn't try to replicate the StarCraft experience step for step. The shift to squad-based combat and completely redesigned resource management system have taught us all that there is no room in this world for a lone soldier or gathering crystals, gas, and trees on the battlefield. These adjustments fit the Warhammer 40k game model extremely well and keep the focus on the action, where it belongs.\n\nThe 3D graphics engine behind Dawn of War's action does a great job of making the epic combat of the 40k universe a personal affair while maintaining the global view that you need to keep track of your forces. Zooming your camera all of the way into the action allows you to see every detail of what is going on in the middle of combat. The animations are tailored fabulously to the characters at hand and are extremely satisfying for those of us that have spent countless hours playing the tabletop game.\n\nThere is nothing quite as satisfying as watching your Dreadnought grab an Eldar soldier, lift him into the air, and rend his body into a bloody pulp. Okay, maybe watching your Whirlwind's missile battery send Orks flying across the battlefield can match it. Whatever your preference, the combat is visceral when you get up close and personal. It is just a shame that the camera can't back out just a little bit farther as the somewhat limited field of view makes it a little bit tricky to keep an eye on a large force. Because of this, using rally points and the quick assignment keys become mandatory in managing your troops.\n\nMultiplayer is standard fare in real-time-strategy games and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War dishes up a pretty satisfying variety of maps and races with which you can wage war. Each of the game's four main races, Space Marine, Ork, Eldar, and Chaos are playable in multiplayer and while the matches can degrade to a battle of numbers, the inclusion of strategic points definitely mixes things up a bit.\n\nHow does Dawn of War stack up to the original tabletop game? Some of the Warhammer 40k nuts out there might disagree with the RTS adaptation of the turn based game. They also might complain that not every vehicle or troop made the jump to the PC. These kind of objections to DoW are nitpicky and don't take into account that this is truly a great real-time-strategy game.\n\nThere is no question why so many gaming enthusiasts voted Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War the top real-time-strategy game when it came out and the game is still one of the best RTS titles in existence. A few minor camera flaws are easily overshadowed by the visceral combat experience that Dawn of War offers.","February 3","true","96.0"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","39","41","8","2"

I was introduced to the Warhammer 40,000 universe by way of the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine third person shooter, which I greatly enjoyed. This universe has intrigued me since then, and I have tried to catch up with the more long-term fans of the franchise by reading up on the lore and such online. It's quite different from most fantasy; where magic and medieval type weaponry is common in fantasy, Warhammer has a refreshing spin on things, relying more on machinery and gunplay while keeping the magic and awe the fantasy genre offers to players. It also falls in the area of dystopian, which is by far my favorite genre of any entertainment, and it is interesting to have a protagonist in this game whose ideals and beliefs could be viewed as fanatical by our standards, but would be understandable in such a future where he serves beneath a totalitarian empire.\n\nMoving on from the universe to the gameplay, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is an RTS that is unique in its approach to a genre that is tried and true. Whereas many RTS games focus on base building and annihilation, this game simplifies the base building and relies more on strategical points that you must capture for resource generation throughout the map. Each campaign or skirmish mission "gets going", so-to-speak, much more quickly than other RTS games. You spend less time buiding and more time moving your armies along the map. For those that find some in the genre to be slow moving in the beginning, Dawn of War brings a welcome change.\n\nSomething else that Dawn of War does well that not enough RTS games do (sometimes at all) is reinforcements and upgrades. Where some games have you upgrade units from their respective recruitment centers and it encompasses all units of the same type, Dawn of War gives you more choice in how you want them upgraded. You can build a group of Space Marines, add reinforcements (making an initial group of four into up to eight), add sergeants later on, commanders, etc. In addition, with upgrades you can have a few men within the group upgrade their weapons, and the selection of weapons is up to you. You can have four rocket launchers, two rocket launchers, one flamethrower, and a laser pistol, or any combination between. This gives the player an ability to build up a small army for one intention (rocket launchers are great at taking out vehicles and buildings, for example), while creating another for a different intention (sending a differently equipped army to fight infantry). Even within firefights, you can reinforce your army if you possess the resources, giving the player a second chance in battle when most RTS games give none.\n\nLastly, it should be noted that I am a single player only strategy player, so I buy games like this for the campaign and skirmishes. In saying that, this game's campaign is fantastic. While somewhat short (eleven missions and about 15 hours of gameplay; note that Steam did not track all of my game time), the story is quite good and involving, taking you across many different types of landscapes and introducing you to different races to fight against. The cutscenes are a bit stilted due to the game's age, and the voice acting (while over-dramatic at times) is fantastic. The missions are vast and varied, and the game never gets in the habit of annoying you with time limits (I hate timed missions in any game, personally). The missions were challenging without being impossible, and they were friendly to both players who like to rush and complete the missions, and players like me, who like to leisurely explore the whole map and take over all positions before deciding to fully vanquish my enemy. Skirmishes are available, offering a few dozen maps that you can choose to play on, giving you choices as to what colors your army wears to which races you fight against, along with a whole myriad of other choices to make to tweak your gameplay if you so choose.\n\nIn summary, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is a fantastic RTS title that makes me very happy I purchased the Master Collection of games, because I am looking forward to experiencing more of this interesting universe. I would recommend it to any fans of RTS, as well as those looking to get into the genre, as this game is extraordinarily user friendly and has a fantastic tutorial. If you are unsure, I urge you to try the demo. I played the demo some time before buying the game and loved what it offered, so it is a fair representation of the game. I can see myself adding this to a list of games I come back to every now and then, because it offers a truly unique strategy experience that stands apart from others. I went into this game with no expectations other than what I'd read through some of the reviews, and after beating it, I consider myself a fan.","January 13, 2015","true","13.9"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","39","43","4","0"

ADVAHNCE!!!!\n\nThis game... Dawn of War is a timeless RTS classic that bumps hips with legendary RTS titles like Starcraft, Age of Empires, and more. The Warhammer 40K universe is mostly about the Blood Ravens (the space marines) and their hellbent (or is that... heavenbent...) mission on purging the world of heretics, and other filth.\n\nIt is simply awesome. I played this game religiously when I was a kid and a friend got it for me on Steam recently, due to other Warhammer titles coming out such as Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide (Yes of course I have the public beta) this game is still one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nThe nostalgia is real.\n\nIf you are an RTS fan, then you'll love this game. It's a bit clunky, but then again it's an old game. Everything about this game screams 10/10. But because it's in the Warhammer universe, I'm rating it 40,000/40,000.\n\nGet this game. Heck, grab the entire collection when it goes on a sale. Every single game has its own value and they're worth every dollar.","October 3, 2015","true","14.9"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","91","39","43","19","2"

WRONG! The only benefits that it gives you are a few extra maps (that you will be unlikely to find yourself playing) and multiplayer functionality (which should have been in the game originally, so the developers really represent american financing at its finest). The point is, the game should not be listed as a "game of the year edition" if it does not deliver on any game of the year edition content. It is falsely labeled and advertised, causing misunderstandings that should not occur in the first place.","October 31, 2015","false","2.9"," 328 of 510 people (64%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","64","328","510","18","13"

As Commander of the Space Marines (The Emperor's Personal Guard), you begin a quest to push back the Orks and determine why they are on the planet. A deep and engaging story-fueled campaign takes you from cities to lost ruins, from mountains lairs to the planets icy tundras, leading a tech heavy force of Space Marines, Mech Walkers, Artillery Tanks, Predator Tanks and Terminator Assault Squads, to unearth the cause of this strange heresy plaguing the planet.\n\nGameplay | Graphics | Sound:  Gameplay is centered around a combination of basebuilding, resource management, unit management, and battlefield tactical combat. Unlike other RTS games however, you will not spend a lot of downtime collecting resources as the game is focused on capturing 'Strategic Points' on the battlefield which keep the onus always on the forward movement of your army. The action is always fast, frenetic and bloody, and always around the next bend in the road. For a game released in 2004, the graphics are a tad dated, but generally hold up extremely well during gameplay. Great sound quality, a phenomenal soundtrack and responsive M&K controls round out a well polished title.\n\nOverall, 'Dawn of War' is a title of legend - one of the finest RTS games of its generation and a must-have for any Strategy gamer. The campaign is deeply satisfying, gameplay is polished, the battles are bloody and unapologetically violent, and somehow you cannot help but be drawn into the Warhammer universe of Orks and Mutants, Heretics and Socerers, Daemons and Blood Gods.

It primarily focuses on the Blood Ravens chapter of the Space Marines so if you want a campaign which allows you to play other factions, then getting Dark Crusade would be a good idea as well (Soulstorm too, though that game also has its issues).\n\nGameplay-wise this is the solid RTS we've come to know and love over the years. You control squads rather than individual units, some squads are customizable in terms of weapons such as Tactical marines to fit the current situation or need. If you really want to test yourself, play against the insane AI on quick start either by yourself or with friends, you will experience some of the most frantic and gloriously messy RTS battles of its time.\n\nAll in all this edition of the original game is solid, though Dark Crusade would be an easier recommendation for those who do not want to deal with some of these technical issues.","November 15, 2014","true","10.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Though the graphics may be well past their prime the mechanics of the game are still fun to this day.  I assume Dawn of War was truly a trendsetter in its time though this review in particular is being typed up by someone who first laid their hands on it in 2015.\n\nThere are several aspects of this game that really hooked me in.  The fact that your units are -actually- units (small bands of soldiers) was a pleasant surprise.  Each unit can be reinforced, given time and requisition (currency), so it will continue to be an active part of your army as long as you replace your losses.  This prevents replacements from clogging up your new unit construction at your base and allows you to keep pressing your advantage without worrying about logistics as soldiers arrive on your frontlines instead of far behind them.  Additionally, I enjoyed being able to personally customize my own units.  If I wanted one unit of Space Marines to excel at eliminating other heavy infantry I could deck them out with a few plasma rifles while if I was going for more an anti-vehicle/building approach with that unit I could supply them with rocket launchers instead.\n\nThough I personally can't think of any complaints on the game as a whole other than stretching and pointing at the outdated graphics, I can say that I enjoyed the campaign far more than I did the random scenarios or multiplayer.  I found that I had a blast playing the game with objectives and a story but the Starcraft model of 'create a horde as fast as possbile and zerg the other base' got old quickly.  However, I am aware that there are -plenty- of players out there who would find that a great addition to the level of fun that they experience, not a detriment.\n\nI recommend this game to all RTS fans especially those who enjoy the more old-school variants.  I picked it up in a sale and got almost fifteen hours out of the Game of the Year version by itself; fifteen hours that I still believe were very well spent.","December 26, 2015","true","14.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Micro on the other hand, is made unique thanks to the squad system(there may be a game that has done this before but as of this review I don't know of an game before this that did the squad system) basically when you make a unit you don't get just the one unit, you get a squad of 4(initial units in each squad does vary for each race/unit type) and can then add more to the squad, and give them special weapons. This is nice mainly because it does mean that attacks where barely anyone survives won't be as devestating since you won't have to make a new batch of units and send them accros the map, as you can just reinforce squads, also it makes selecting a large group of units easier. And the fact that you can give your squads weapons means that you can make each squad have multiple purposes. Still if you've played an RTS before then this will feel a bit familiar but the things that the game has that most rts games don't will make it seem new and not more of the same.\n\nOverall this is an amzing game that I would recommend to anyone who likes rts or Warhammer 40k(it actually made me really intrested in 40k I even got the Dark Vengeance set because of this game).\n\nNote: This is my first review that took me more than a minute to write, if there was something that I could've done better or if there's something I forget to mention feel free to let me know(I already know my intro is kinda lackluster).\n\n\n\n","August 5, 2014","true","12.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I fell in love with this game at the moment I layed eye upon its beuty! The gameplay is really well rouned, the UI is pretty steady, the gameplay gives the "mission accomplished and I'm a BADASS" feel. The Story is pretty interesting as you progress through it, there's no multiplayer due to GameSpy shutting down, but you can still setup a battle with the CPU, up to roughly 8 players, or 4v4 on a map. Definitely worth the payout! I give this game a 10/10.

The Orks have there main strategy, outgun and outman the opponent and then overpower them. The Eldar have there snipers and magical elements with warlocks and the seer council showing their spedialty being long range then slice n' dice. The Space Marines are the standard force but seemingly the only ones (apart from the Chaos Space Marines) who can give a good defensive against the Orks and when they band together, they destroy the Orks with ease. The Chaos Space Marines are as close as you can get to pure evil and very similar to the Space Marines and if you spawn next to them from the start, there is no escape. This game plays very well and I can't compare it much to the boardgame as I never played it but the story is pretty good, I have nothing to argue there. This plays more like an RTS rather than Dawn of War II which is a TC or Tactical Command but both are still amazing and giev good variety between games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sEvher/recommended/4570/","sEvher","sEver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sEvher/","143 products in account","Dawn of War is a timeless classic. I've played this game years ago but it seems it hasn't lost any of it's sweetness.\n\nHere are some things that make Dawn of War different:\n\nGameplay:1. Resource management is basically reduced to territory control.\nThe more strategic points you control and the better you fortify them, the more of the 'requisition' resource you get.\n\nInvesting into strategic point fortification, makes them harder to capture and after simple upgrade, they can shoot at your enemies. So you're basically building sentry turrets that mine resources for you.\n\n2. Squad reinforcment\nMost units operate as squads. You get a squad of 4 marines, and you can add to it (reinforce) untill you got 8 marines. With upgrades you can add a sergeant who has a skill to rally them and instantly restore Morale. If few of your marines die, you can just reinforce the squad, and they will appear at the squad position at the fraction of a cost of a new squad. This allows you to push forward after a battle with little delay without moving new forces from base to the frontlines.\n\n3. Squad equipment\nYou can equip your squads with weapons effective against certain types of units, you can mix them up in one squad, or just have a dedicated squad for every type. This provides interesting choices and allows for more variety in your tactics.\n\n4. Cover\nHaving your units sit in a bomb crater, behind a wall or in the trees, makes them harder to hit and they also feel better (see Morale)\n\n5. Morale\nCertain situations make units lose their composure and lower their effectiveness. Especially when they fight outnumbered, or against intimidating opponents or weapons (flamethrowers, snipers).\n\n6. Space considerations with 'macro'\nYou need to think about the space your forces are going to operate in. You wont fit 3 tanks and 4 squads of infantry into a narrow street, without totally compromising their ability to efficiently move and operate. They will get stuck, bump into each other and wont be able to all get to the front to shoot the enemy you encounter. Some people say it's a downside and speak about "bugged pathing". Pathing is ok, it's just that Space Marines have "Space" in there for a reason :>\nIf you fail to chose the path wide enough for your forces to move through comfortably, you're going to have to accept the fact they take much longer to get into position, and if they get attacked while the squad is not in tight formation, some of them will be in range to the enemy while others might not be.\n\nSettting:It's Warhammer 40k.\nIn the Dark Grim Future there is only War. Space Marines aka "Adeptus Astartes" operate in chapters similar to battle-orders of old and live to fulfill the will of the God Emperor.\nThey routinely drop from orbit in droppods, a\nWhole WH40k universe is full of awesomeness and I guarantee you wont regret getting into it.\n\nHigh production value:Dawn of War has some of the best voice acting in videogaming of last decade.\n\nMost buildings you build are dropped by your battle barge Litany of Fury from high orbit with a very loud "thump" when they impact (it's hard to call it landing).\n\nAnimations of a dreadnaught cherry picking an orc from enemy squad, breaking his back while setting him on fire and then tossing him in an arc over 2 tanks and a squad of infantry are priceless.\n\nBlood is everywhere and in general you can set perment scaring and bodies, so your progress through the map can be marked with bodies of your enemies.\n\nTL;DR:\nDawn of War is a game like no other, except it's successors in the Dawn of War series: Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, Soulstorm\n\nTotally recommend to any and all fans of RTS games and/or WH40k universe.\n\nIf you think you could like this game, but would like something with a bit more replayability (Dawn of War only has Space Marine campaign and skirmish/multiplayer) take a look at Dark Crusade and Soulstorm, which are a source of endless entertainment with their conqeur-the-planet style of gameplay and 7 different races to choose from.\n\nAlso be advised, that it's an old game and it has problems with wide-screen resolutions which might or might not be fixed.\nMyself I just played it in a 1280x1024 window. The same problem exists in Winter Assault, but Dark Crusade and Soulstorms are ok with any resolution in fullscreen.","January 13, 2015","true","16.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

I love the game and the franchise as well as the universe of Warhammer 40k. The campaign is really enjoyabled to play. Although eventually I find it that it's a bit boring fighting Orcs over and over and over again. But then fortunatly we change to fight the Eldar and after shortly we fight the Chaos Space Marines.\nThe game is about the Blood Ravens protecting an Imperium world from an Orc Invastion. Later the story folds out that other forces are at work on this planet and that their is an aftefact that if controlled by the wrong hands, it'll realse a Deamon Prince. The game is total worth playing and you should play this first before you play the other Dawn of war games: Since this is the one that started it and contains important information about the chapter which will make it easier for you to understand on what is going on later in the franchise.\nI'd give this a rating 9/10 since it's one of the best RTS games and it was realsed in 2004. However the only thing I think this game should of had was an map creator. As this would suit the game perfectly and an RTS game called Age of Myhtology done it back in 2001.

This game was the dawn of the Dawn of War series, and an outstanding game in its own right.\n\nIn the single player campaign, you play as the Space Marines. Through various maps and settings, the story builds towards a handful of epic confrontations, and the difficulty progresses in like manner. Playing on normal is a little too easy, but push the difficulty up and you will find yourself challenged (disclaimer: I'm not very good at RTS games).\n\nVenture into multiplayer, and you will have four races at your disposal, each with their pros and cons: Chaos Marines, Elder, Orks and Space Marines. I found the multiplayer portion of the game to be well-balanced, with end game units strong but not so readily accessible to make one race overpowered.\n\nLastly, if you're playing on any system built in the last seven-eight years, I HIGHLY recommend following the below guide to get widescreen resolutions working (all credit goes to OP):\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=205040803\n\nI used the modified files provided and they worked perfectly for me.

These can be tuned with new gear and restocked when they fall.\nIt allows for an easy way to still have an impressive army steam-roll an enemy encampment without having to micro-manage everything.\n\nI had fun, and will definitely pick up the sequel (EDIT: Then I did, it's great too. Review here)\nAvoid this game if you can't stomach the dead-pan Space Marine seriousness though, it can get a bit much (and it's the only faction that has a campaign).","August 24, 2014","true","12.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It makes you care about winning, it makes you care about the Empire.\n\nThe gameplay is solid but nothing impressive. It maintains the standard resource based RTS gameplay but just replaces gold mines with strategic points. The units work great though, the sounds and looks of Space Marines and Ork's alike make them come alive and brings a great level of immersion.\n\nWhat takes Dawn of War from being just another solid RTS game to being a great RTS is not something that can be easily explained.\n\nIt is the satisfaction you get from hearing the thump of a Thunderhammer impacting an Ork's skull.

Dawn of War is a title which doesn't just simply entertain, it takes a special place in the player's memory, and it does so due to two reasons. The first and the more considerable of these two reasons lies in the very fact that this game is set in the grim future of the 41st millennium, a future where there is only war, death and the laughter of thirsting gods. However, in order to adapt such a brilliant setting to the screen of computers, experienced, devoted and skilled game designers had to take matters into their own hands. This is where the second reason for the titles success comes into play - the developers. Relic Entertainment had the right framework to build their RTS upon from the very beginning, but even with such a great basis as the WH40k universe, talent and thoroughness were required so as to make a good quality game. Before DoW, several WH40k titles were already developed for the PC, with most of them being released in the 90's. While these predecessors were usually of good quality, certain factors prevented them from being as accomplished as DoW, graphical limitations being one of them. Relic Entertainment utilized the technology which was available in 2004 to implement the best possible graphics into their RTS, and graphics are indeed one of the most remarkable attributes which Dawn of War possesses, even to this day. The gameplay mechanics are also unique and exceptional, as are all the other aspects of the game.\n\nIn Dawn of War, Relic Entertainment employed a semi-innovative resource control system. Unlike in some older, well known real-time strategies where the player had to directly gather resources which fueled his armies growth, in DoW the economy revolves around control over strategic points that are scattered all across the battlefield. The amount of the strategic points controlled is crucial since they directly affect the players requisition income, thus forcing the opposing combatants to constantly fight for the control over territory. In addition to strategic points which play the primary resource role and grant requisition, DoW also has a secondary resource called power. This resource is just as essential as requisition, since power is required for researching or upgrading technologies and abilities, and is also spent when deploying advanced units and vehicles. In order to gain power resource points, the commander must build power generator structures either near his base of operations or at special slag deposits which grant more power income. By the time Dawn of War was released, the requisition control system was new but not unheard of, since there were already games that utilized a somewhat similar concept. Massive Entertainment's Ground Control II for an example, which was released approximately three months before DoW, used a system called acquisition in which points were earned through the capturing of victory locations. Later on, Massive Entertainment used the same system in their well acclaimed RTT World in Conflict. In fairness it must be said, that even though Relic's resource control system was at that time both original and well designed, it wasn't actually their invention. They did, however, put this system to good use, because in terms of economical balance, DoW is a perfectly designed RTS. Missions in-game usually alternate between jungles and ravaged urban ruins, with Fog of War being persistent in those areas of the map which either have not yet been uncovered or were abandoned by allied forces. In battle, the environment plays a minor strategic role as well, on account of that in Dawn of War, certain types of terrain can provide troops with either good cover, granting them a protection bonus, or harmful cover which exposes the troops and makes them vulnerable to enemy fire. In general, terrain and the surrounding environment both contribute to the tactical detail of the game, with infantry traversing faster over certain terrain types, while treaded vehicles will move slower. Infantry squads all have morale that affects their combat effectiveness. An infantry squad with broken morale will be much less effective in combat, and will need to retreat in order to replenish their fighting spirit. Squad leaders also give each squad a significant morale boost. Enemy infantry has morale as well, and certain weapons, such as for an example a flamethrower, can break it faster, rendering enemy formations broken and in a state of moral dismay. In Dawn of War, there are four different factions which are anything but similar and are all driven to annihilate each other. All four of these factions have their own distinctive units, structures and strategies. Units can be divided into infantry and vehicles, with infantry groups usually being versatile and possessing the ability to capture strategic points, while vehicles often take an assault force role. Dawn of War provides the player with an immense arsenal of weaponry, including artillery, tanks and walker vehicles. Unlike some RTS games where opposing armies often have visually different but functionally identical units, in DoW units which are exclusive to one certain faction are unique in the sense that they rarely have a counterpart amongst the three other factions. Therefore, all units in DoW are not only distinguishable by their appearance, but also by their abilities and properties. The Tech-Tree in the game is well developed, each faction has numerous types of infantry, vehicles, skills, technologies and upgrades. The player can also upgrade his primary and defensive structures to go higher in the tech tree, further benefiting his fighting force. In the single-player campaign, the player will have the opportunity to play as the Space Marines Blood Ravens chapter, taking the role of Force Commander Gabriel Angelos. Throughout 11 bloody missions, players will first fight against the Ork menace, will struggle against the mysterious Eldar, and will then finally engage against the traitorous Chaos Space Marines. Most of the missions are focused on elimination of the enemy base and army. Dawn of War offers three levels of difficulty, with the "Insane" difficulty level being the most entertaining and challenging one. The gameplay in Dawn of War can be described as balanced, intense and loaded with ceaseless combat action.\n\nDawn of War has detailed, beautiful graphics which appear terrific and well modeled even up to today’s standards, regardless of the fact that the game is over 11 years old. The palette in DoW fits the WH40k's universe perfectly, with darker tones overshadowing the brighter ones. The colors in game are full of contrast, all is dark yet by no means monotonous. Also, the darkness which pervades in the game by no means makes it faded or bleak; the game is rich in color, and everything has it's unique shade, from crimson blood spilled over the crusted earth to the smeared paint on war-scarred vehicle armor. In my opinion, the graphics in DoW are beyond any criticism, and were obviously created by competent individuals. The UI was elaborately designed to resemble a futuristic electronic panel, whilst the menu backgrounds appear as old parchments (with holy dogmas and aphorisms adorning the corners of these parchments).\n\nDoW isn't merely a well designed, good quality game, it is a game with a soul, and that alone says much, because such games are very hard to come by. It is worthy of staying in your heart, for once you play it, you suddenly acquire understanding of what an RTS should be like. Relic Entertainment has successfully brought a WH40K RTS to the display of computers, and for that they deserve honours. Dawn of War is the definition of an outstanding real time strategy, and whoever plays it can be fully confident, that his expectation won't be ruined.","January 31","true","21.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The interface borrows from the Blizzard school of RTS as opposed to the Westwood School. You are given a fair amnount of info for each unit, it;s damage, it's strengths it's weakness, etc.\n\nHowever, it's rather scarce on content compared to many of it's peers. Little hint,. If you're going to have multiple factions in an RTS, it behooves you to at least due a story campaign for each of them. Heck even the ancient Dune 2 had a campaign for each house.\n\nWhy is this an issue you may wonder. Well, while the marine campaign is indeed nice, I would have loved to play an ork campaign or a chaos camapin... you get what I'm saying? They've created a lovely universe with nicely done inhabitants but yet they confine you to just one.. I hear the expansions add more campaigns but those are extra which makes me wonder. ... Why? I mean I know Other games did this as well but again they gave you a solid offering for all factions before tacking on the extras.\n\nSo while I can recommend, this game is rather low on my 'must buy' list because of that.\n\nGraphically it's pretty nice for it's time, quite nice, gameplay and strategy has a tendency to be a little linear. The squad idea is a nice aesthetic but really doesn't amount to much, gameplay wise. . FOr what I played during the free weekend fun but ... meh... not teh sort of RTS I would genuinely come back to again. It's just too generic in story and too linear in gameplay.","September 27, 2015","true","98.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Radiating that unique halo of the Warhammer 40K franchise, it appeals to any fan tremendously, while still holding a certain entertainment value to a complete stranger, too. Concerning campaign, the plot is traditionally brutal and somewhat enigmatic, and the roleplaying aspect is rather decent for an RTS. In two words, there are Space Marines, and their famous Tartarus campaign (with Imperial Guard cameo, sort of). Concerning skirmish, the tech-trees are quite clear, and the resource management is pretty straightforward. The game is about battle tactics and strategies, and in this field it delivers fairly deep and dynamic experience. In skirmish, Orks, Eldar, and Chaos factions are all playable, too. And re-playable, and enjoyable, of course.\n\nTalking cons, the textures and video FX are so... oldschool, and the music is rather naive to my taste. Besides, the in-game tooltip fonts are so small that it's almost unreadable, and also unscalable, just like this Steam's built-in browser. But the most annoying thing in the whole game is the dumbest pathfinding ever, which makes fielding large armies quite a challenge. See, the map landscape is typically uneven here, the terrain is rough, and the ruins are everywhere (supposed to be tactical, I think). That doesn't work well with bad pathfinding, - when you issue a move order for several squads at once, you can see them crowding, loosing formations, getting stuck, holding each other, then running away or apart from each other, and begging to be shot during all the hilarious process. Now, THAT is not something to which you can accomodate, not after playing so many modern RTS with brilliant pathfinding. That's why, against modern standards (e.g. DoW II), the game is a bit too uncomfortable to play on a regular basis.\n\nVerdict: definitely a "must have" for the fans of Warhammer 40K universe, and well recommended for the students of classic RTS. For everybody else - it's your call, but I'd recommend starting with DoW II instead.","September 6, 2014","true","32.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/recommended/4570/","korerat","KoreRat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/","636 products in account","Just like the other 885,363 PC gamers out there, a few weeks ago I picked up a copy of the Humble THQ Bundle. Not only was it a great deal for some games, it was also a way to help a company in need.  Now everyone can argue the ‘Hows’ and ‘Whys’ of THQ’s current situation, but at the end of the day gamers aren’t overly interested in their products.  And its hurting them more than it has in years.  But this isn’t an financial overview of the current fiscal situation of THQ.\n\nThis is a Bargain Bin Breakdown, and the game is Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War.  And you may have figured out prior to the break that I’ve never played anything Warhammer 40,000 before.  So its another unbiased review that falls completely on the games merit!  I love it when that happens.  However, with schedules tightening and life being life, I’m not always able to play an entire game.  Its actually a difficult choice on what to play when and for how long.  And having nine new games added to my Steam games list only makes it more of a challenge.  Do you realize I’ve had L.A. Noire for months and have yet to play it?!\n\nBut I’m rambling again…\n\nMy plan with Dawn of War was to play at least 3 missions of the main campaign then a skirmish as the enemy faction.  This, in theory, would give me enough to rate the games mechanics, story, and balance.  After which point I could continue to play, if the game had captured my interest, or begin writing my review.  Everything started well.  I played the tutorial so I could see which type of RTS this was.  Then I started the first mission.\n\nI was impressed at how well they tell the story with the opening sequences.  Even if I wasn’t really following what was going on with the story, the way in which it was given was very well done.  Unfortunately, to me its just another Orc vs Human story that I can’t find interest in.\n\nAnd unfortunately I've never had any interest into the types of worlds where Orcs are present.  I am a fan of Science Fiction, but Fantasy hasn't ever done it for me.  Orcs, Elves, Humans, Middle Earth, whatever or where ever it is, hasn't been my thing.  I've played the WarCraft games, I’ve seen the Lord of the Rings movies, I attempted to read a few different stories in the past.  But none of it really sparks much interest in me.  So the real challenge with games of this genre is to excite me in other ways.  Which has happened, but is a rare occurrence.\n\nI can’t find any of the Orcs terrifying, or anything other than plain stupid, and in this game its no different, they just look goofy.  Sure the graphics are dated, but not so bad, and I kinda enjoyed them since they reminded me of Star Wars Galaxies.  But the models themselves, and the designs that were chosen.  A part of my lack of interest in the fantasy worlds fall under technology.  The worlds always look very similar to the Middle Ages, but then there will be some sort of advanced technology that just doesn't fit.\n\nThe Humans are actually fine in this regard since everything of theirs looks and matches the advance space faring race type.  However the Ocrs look like a lesser advanced race, until they bust out the battle units.  And I just can’t accept being so far advanced on one side and looking a few centuries behind on the other.\n\nBut story and setting or not I can still play a game.  So I brushed aside my opinions of the story and played on, enjoying the games itself.  And the mechanics are amazing.  The first mission did a great job of holding my hand and guiding me through the process of playing.  Sure, I had learned a bit from the tutorial, but had quit that about halfway in.  It didn’t take long to finish the mission, and even take a moment to realize that I have genuinely enjoyed playing the game.\n\nThen came the second mission.  And while I did enjoy myself for most of it, my enjoyment started to ween.  There came a point in the mission where my troops, just a couple of infantry squads, felt so overpowered.  There wasn’t anything they could’t take out in a matter of seconds.  I expected it to be on the easier side this early in the game, but this was ridiculous.  The hand holding was still there, which wasn’t a big deal, just not really necessary.\n\nIn between he missions are more story pieces.  And I’m not sure what to call them, since they’re not FMV or cinematic’s   They are scripted sequences that take place on the map itself.  Often before you take over control of the game and start the mission.  It was really well done, and probably my favorite thing out of this game.\n\nI did also love the dead units not disappearing from the battlefield.  There’s just something about watching your enemies slain pile up.  It really brings to light just how many souls you’ve taken in your quest for vengeance.\n\nOnto the third mission, this is where everything changed.  This is where the game got real.\n\nIt starts with a pre-built base and units guarding checkpoints.  It starts with you coming under attack.  And the attacks don’t waver.  Now I will offer the chance that I was completely missing some important factoid that makes the mission easier.  But I did try it three separate times.  Each time I was unable to build up or maintain a defense force while also building an attack force.  And after awhile the tanks rolled in, and I hadn’t a chance.\n\nThat’s when a friend informed me of a Mech unit that was located on the map.  So on the fourth attempt I managed to hold my ground long enough to seek out this unit.  I found it and unlocked the ability to build more of them.  And with these new units I swept through the lands slaughtering all that came in my path.  And completed the mission.\n\nBut here is the problem.  While on previous missions my infantry units mowed through people and buildings like they were all made of paper, now the enemy has tanks and is mowing through me in the same fashion.  Until I get these Mech units, and it sways back into my favor.  I don’t like this.  This doesn’t feel like balance.  It feels like the scales are swaying back and forth.  One side always has an advantage over the other, its just the who that changes.\n\nSo I tried a Skirmish, just to see.  A standard 8 team Free For All, where I played as the same faction that I was in the campaign.  It was pretty uneventful, I may have had it on too easy of a difficulty.  But I managed to build a base and maintain my defenses from a few attacks, and then build up my attack force.  Then I sent them out to battle, and they walked right through the enemy like paper…\n\nNow, when I play a mission I tend to have double the needed units to succeed, sometimes triple.  I love nothing more than having units in the triple digits.  Dawn of War, like most others of its RTS type, has a population limit.  Sometimes I can work with this, but I always feel like its not enough.\n\nBut don’t think I’m going to trash this game because of the apparent major change in the difficulty curve from mission two to mission three.  Or because the balance feels to be in constant shift.  Because of what I did play of this game I did enjoy.  A lot of this game I thought was great and pretty ground breaking for its time.  I just can’t create any connection with the characters, units, or setting.\n\nBut I have no plans to uninstalling or forgetting about Dawn of War, I will keep it there, ready for when I’m ready to come back to it.  But most of all this time spent has shown me where Company of Heroes really came from.  Which seeing as I’ve been obsessed with that game is a great way to open my eyes to its evolution.  Things that I don’t like, or don’t feel like they work in Dawn of War are not present in Company of Heroes.

It's still way up there, right next to its sequel. It positively -screams- the need for more games in the setting. Sadly, things went ploin-shaped for THQ, so we'll have to wait a while for that to settle out and get studios working on more proper Warhammer games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/recommended/4570/","korerat","KoreRat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/","636 products in account","Just like the other 885,363 PC gamers out there, a few weeks ago I picked up a copy of the Humble THQ Bundle. Not only was it a great deal for some games, it was also a way to help a company in need.  Now everyone can argue the ‘Hows’ and ‘Whys’ of THQ’s current situation, but at the end of the day gamers aren’t overly interested in their products.  And its hurting them more than it has in years.  But this isn’t an financial overview of the current fiscal situation of THQ.\n\nThis is a Bargain Bin Breakdown, and the game is Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War.  And you may have figured out prior to the break that I’ve never played anything Warhammer 40,000 before.  So its another unbiased review that falls completely on the games merit!  I love it when that happens.  However, with schedules tightening and life being life, I’m not always able to play an entire game.  Its actually a difficult choice on what to play when and for how long.  And having nine new games added to my Steam games list only makes it more of a challenge.  Do you realize I’ve had L.A. Noire for months and have yet to play it?!\n\nBut I’m rambling again…\n\nMy plan with Dawn of War was to play at least 3 missions of the main campaign then a skirmish as the enemy faction.  This, in theory, would give me enough to rate the games mechanics, story, and balance.  After which point I could continue to play, if the game had captured my interest, or begin writing my review.  Everything started well.  I played the tutorial so I could see which type of RTS this was.  Then I started the first mission.\n\nI was impressed at how well they tell the story with the opening sequences.  Even if I wasn’t really following what was going on with the story, the way in which it was given was very well done.  Unfortunately, to me its just another Orc vs Human story that I can’t find interest in.\n\nAnd unfortunately I've never had any interest into the types of worlds where Orcs are present.  I am a fan of Science Fiction, but Fantasy hasn't ever done it for me.  Orcs, Elves, Humans, Middle Earth, whatever or where ever it is, hasn't been my thing.  I've played the WarCraft games, I’ve seen the Lord of the Rings movies, I attempted to read a few different stories in the past.  But none of it really sparks much interest in me.  So the real challenge with games of this genre is to excite me in other ways.  Which has happened, but is a rare occurrence.\n\nI can’t find any of the Orcs terrifying, or anything other than plain stupid, and in this game its no different, they just look goofy.  Sure the graphics are dated, but not so bad, and I kinda enjoyed them since they reminded me of Star Wars Galaxies.  But the models themselves, and the designs that were chosen.  A part of my lack of interest in the fantasy worlds fall under technology.  The worlds always look very similar to the Middle Ages, but then there will be some sort of advanced technology that just doesn't fit.\n\nThe Humans are actually fine in this regard since everything of theirs looks and matches the advance space faring race type.  However the Ocrs look like a lesser advanced race, until they bust out the battle units.  And I just can’t accept being so far advanced on one side and looking a few centuries behind on the other.\n\nBut story and setting or not I can still play a game.  So I brushed aside my opinions of the story and played on, enjoying the games itself.  And the mechanics are amazing.  The first mission did a great job of holding my hand and guiding me through the process of playing.  Sure, I had learned a bit from the tutorial, but had quit that about halfway in.  It didn’t take long to finish the mission, and even take a moment to realize that I have genuinely enjoyed playing the game.\n\nThen came the second mission.  And while I did enjoy myself for most of it, my enjoyment started to ween.  There came a point in the mission where my troops, just a couple of infantry squads, felt so overpowered.  There wasn’t anything they could’t take out in a matter of seconds.  I expected it to be on the easier side this early in the game, but this was ridiculous.  The hand holding was still there, which wasn’t a big deal, just not really necessary.\n\nIn between he missions are more story pieces.  And I’m not sure what to call them, since they’re not FMV or cinematic’s   They are scripted sequences that take place on the map itself.  Often before you take over control of the game and start the mission.  It was really well done, and probably my favorite thing out of this game.\n\nI did also love the dead units not disappearing from the battlefield.  There’s just something about watching your enemies slain pile up.  It really brings to light just how many souls you’ve taken in your quest for vengeance.\n\nOnto the third mission, this is where everything changed.  This is where the game got real.\n\nIt starts with a pre-built base and units guarding checkpoints.  It starts with you coming under attack.  And the attacks don’t waver.  Now I will offer the chance that I was completely missing some important factoid that makes the mission easier.  But I did try it three separate times.  Each time I was unable to build up or maintain a defense force while also building an attack force.  And after awhile the tanks rolled in, and I hadn’t a chance.\n\nThat’s when a friend informed me of a Mech unit that was located on the map.  So on the fourth attempt I managed to hold my ground long enough to seek out this unit.  I found it and unlocked the ability to build more of them.  And with these new units I swept through the lands slaughtering all that came in my path.  And completed the mission.\n\nBut here is the problem.  While on previous missions my infantry units mowed through people and buildings like they were all made of paper, now the enemy has tanks and is mowing through me in the same fashion.  Until I get these Mech units, and it sways back into my favor.  I don’t like this.  This doesn’t feel like balance.  It feels like the scales are swaying back and forth.  One side always has an advantage over the other, its just the who that changes.\n\nSo I tried a Skirmish, just to see.  A standard 8 team Free For All, where I played as the same faction that I was in the campaign.  It was pretty uneventful, I may have had it on too easy of a difficulty.  But I managed to build a base and maintain my defenses from a few attacks, and then build up my attack force.  Then I sent them out to battle, and they walked right through the enemy like paper…\n\nNow, when I play a mission I tend to have double the needed units to succeed, sometimes triple.  I love nothing more than having units in the triple digits.  Dawn of War, like most others of its RTS type, has a population limit.  Sometimes I can work with this, but I always feel like its not enough.\n\nBut don’t think I’m going to trash this game because of the apparent major change in the difficulty curve from mission two to mission three.  Or because the balance feels to be in constant shift.  Because of what I did play of this game I did enjoy.  A lot of this game I thought was great and pretty ground breaking for its time.  I just can’t create any connection with the characters, units, or setting.\n\nBut I have no plans to uninstalling or forgetting about Dawn of War, I will keep it there, ready for when I’m ready to come back to it.  But most of all this time spent has shown me where Company of Heroes really came from.  Which seeing as I’ve been obsessed with that game is a great way to open my eyes to its evolution.  Things that I don’t like, or don’t feel like they work in Dawn of War are not present in Company of Heroes.

The opening cinematic in paritcular, was at the time, quite impressive. Warhammer 40k was something I had never heard of, and so to go from StarCraft to this darker, and grittier world was right up my gutter. The campaign was short, but it was quickly followed up by several expansions that kept the game fresh and fun. Playing it again now, I was surprised to see how little of that experience had changed. Sure, the game runs at 1024 by 768, and the graphics seem less impressive, but the mechanics of developing your squad and gathering resources through the continual conquering of your enemies really made this game a blast. At the end of the day, it's all about how much fun you're having, and this game is a lot of fun offline and online. It should be said that the campaign tells a story that is nothing special in terms of actual content or twists, but it is fantastically well told with voice actors who truly breathe life into the mythical Space Marines. This game is in a class of it's own and showed the world that there was room for another Sci Fi RTS could standout from C&C and StarCraft. A must own.","November 27, 2013","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game truly holds well even to this day, well over a decade afters its initial release. The game offers an interested and very fun singleplayer campaign where you play as the  Blood Ravens Space Marine chapter as they fight against a massive Ork force on an imperial planet. It's up to you to use your brain and tactical sense to destroy the Ork menace. But as time goes on the forces of Chaos arrive as well as the elusive Eldar and the stakes only begin to rise. The gameplay is solid. From the army commands as well as base building and management. Unlike other, older, RTS games the way you gain recources is by capturing and holding points that are around the battlemap making those areas complete hotspots for some epic large battles. You get to command large armies and pit them against other large armies, unique units and buildings per factions (four factions are available in the game), an army painter (very basic, but still fun to use custom armies in skirmish), and overall the game has a lot to offer. There are some downsides sadly, but these are more in the technical side rather than the game itself, the game does not support 16:9 resolutions, but with some mods you are able to force a 16:9 resolution in the game, but the mini map tends to bug out. The unit path finding can be a bit wonky at times as well and artillery units can be a real pain if you don't know how to properly use them, but overall nothing too serious, just minor inconveniences. This is a great game for both RTS fans and Warhammer 40k fans or if you're a fan of both, you're doing yourself an unjustice by not owning and playing this great game.","May 18","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It actually does feel like you're playing the Warhammer 40K tabletop game, except without all of the hassle. While the graphics are lacking nowadays, the gameplay and fun factor are still top-notch. There is base building, but it doesn't require an insane amount of micro-managing like SC2 does, for example. What makes this game so enjoyable to me is that you spend the majority of your time managing your massive army and it's just straight up fun to do.\n\nThe campaign is OK and worth a single playthrough. Just be prepared for drawn out conversations, overly wordy narration, and some incredibly terrible voice acting (though it does have a particular charm). The meat and potatoes is the multiplayer mode, which you can play against CPU bots or online. In this version of the game you can pick between four factions which include Space Marines, Orks, Eldar and Chaos.\n\nHighly recommended.","June 10, 2015","true","40.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

I can't use the coupon, so I'd accept just about any offer.\n\nThis game is good. It fixes most of the common flaws of the RTS genre (lookin at you, Starcraft). Small, plentiful units are grouped into squads and basic/obvious tasks are handled automatically, so there's less micro-managing/actions-per-second and more actual strategy. It's nice to command troops that aren't totally incompetent. The point-capture-for-resources gameplay is reminiscent of the Battlefield series, and a little bit of an improvement IMHO.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kartasto/recommended/4570/","kartasto","Atlas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kartasto/","172 products in account","Dawn of War is one of my favorite RTS games, even though I suck ♥♥♥ at them, Dawn of War is one I find myself picking up again and again to play. The game takes the setting in the Warhammer 40k universe and lets you control one of a few factions from the Warhammer lore to battle other players. The factions in this game are the Space Marines, Eldar, Orks, and Chaos Space Marines.\n\nThe game, and the series, has many pros; the game has base building, units in squads, vehicles, and pretty decent destruction effects. The aingle player is decent I think and is a good few hours of gameplay and then the multiplayer is like a lot of RTS games however it has resource points you take and hold on the map to keep a steady flow of resources to your side to build buildings and troops. The game offers a variety of modes players can wage battle in such as take and hold (which is taking critical points and holding them to win), annihalation (which is just killing the other side), and capture the flag and so on.\n\nThe only bad thing I think when it comes to this game is that it is an older game and a few computers have had issues running it but for the most part it seems to be able to run on the newer systems. If not then most fixes can be found online.\n\nIn the end if you enjoy games like Company of Heroes, Starcraft, Warcraft, etc. then I would recommend this game. The gameplay is well done, pretty well balanced, and enjoyable to play with some friends or just to pass some times with. If you are a fan of the Warhammer 40k lore and setting than this game is great.","June 2, 2015","true","17.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LtKaiden/recommended/4570/","LtKaiden","ltkkkaiden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LtKaiden/","170 products in account","So this is my first entry into the Warhammer 40,000 universe and I must say I was very impressed. Simple to understand, excessively violent and nearly a perfect strategy game that marks the pinnacle of RTS games of it's era.\n\nThe story, not to spoil a single thing is superb for an RTS. In my opinion, the story is easily better than that of many games today. With it's twists, turns and full stops, it's a rather moving ride. As you complete missions, the story unfolds a little more until it all breaks down and becomes less of a story to do with missions than all out annihilation. Spending 15 hours with the Blood Raven Space Marine chapter tearing apart Ork by Ork, Eldar by Eldar and Chaos by ♥♥♥♥ing Chaos was a blast and even towards the end never lacked for excitement. However that leads me to slight dismay with the game. Even early in the 15 hours I got sick of playing the same units and the same strategy, the campaign never challanged me to try something different. Maybe it was because I was playing on Normal rather than anything hardcore, but it felt that way. The only time it made me do something strikingly different was when I was pushing away at early linear tutorial missions. However despite this, it's still an excellent game - especially for it's time. Relic, the guys who developed this, along with other award-winning and highly recommended RTS games such as Homeworld and the Company of Heroes franchise did an great job polishing it, making it look strikingly beautiful (of course for it's time) and simple but not bland.\n\nNow onto the Skirmish/Multiplayer. Basically the same mode where on varied maps players/AI must battle it out to complete different objectives based on game modes and on many different maps. Map variety is great, even without the expansions and despite not doing much in the skirmish, you could tell that you'd be in for something different just looking at the startup skirmish screen. Whether you play as the Eldar, Orks, Space Marines or Chaos (plus more if you have expansions and use the CD keys on those expansions) you have a varied playstyle and each race is balanced making skirmishes fair each time. However, another point I must bring up, and I've noticed in Relic's other game - Company of Heroes is, that the AI seems to just do the same each game. I may have said the maps make varied gameplay, but mainly against players or if the bots are decently hard. The AI 9/10 do the same thing each time and makes them very predictable leaving them easily destroyable.\n\nIf you skipped reading that, you're ♥♥♥♥ing lazy, but I came prepared:\n\nPros\n\n- Varied Skirmish Maps\n- Balanced and different factions to play as on skirmish.\n- Great story was it's twists and turns.\n\nCons\n\n- AI often predictable on skirmishes.\n- Campaign, despite fun, becomes rather repetitive towards the end. One term: Annihilation.\n\nOverall I'd rate it easily a 8.5/10.","January 23","true","17.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Enjoy playing a game that has virtually no balance problems. Enjoy playing a game with 9 different races that somehow all play the same, something that Starcraft 2 Heart of The Swarm currently is beginning to fail at.\n\nEnjoy playing a game where each race has a super weapon that is literally a giant unit from a giant tank, to a large, fat pyramid-ish cube with a giant laser beam, or even a big pig...thing with lasers on it's head, bigger than the swimming pool you went to last month.\n\nTrust me... these Super Weapons put Command and Conquer's Super Weapons at the kiddie table, they make them look like pea shooters almost. Oh... what's that? One is an energy field that makes all tanks and vehicles invulnerable for a short time? One of them is an ion blast fired from a sattelite in space or something? One of them is a nuke?\n\nOnly the Nuke super weapon stands up to any of these.\n\nThe game works off of unlimited resources known as Requisition and Power. Power, you make generators to make, and Requisition is gained from taking and holding points throughout a map. Both can be upgraded in a different way to produce more resources faster.\n\nAnyonewho is a fan of strategy games who has NOT played this one is just simply missing out.\n\nThis game is the closest anyone will ever get to a seemingly perfect game in it's own rights, and to add to it, it's got wonderful voiceacting, awesome soundtracks and rather impressive visuals for it's time, all of which stands just aswell today.\n\nHardcore RTS fans can agree that if you are a HUGE fan of the Real-Time Strategy Game, you owe it to yourself to try this.\n\nThe game has 3 expansions, the first one adds The Imperial Gaurd, the second adds the Tau and Necrons, and the thirds adds the Sisters of Battle and the Dark Eldar.\n\nAll 3 add onto the game and simply make it one of the best if not the best RTS in existence so far.\n\nAlso only Soulstorm has much of an actual multiplayer, because people only play it, so if multiplayer is what you're looking for... well try out the skirmish mode, and if you like this, get the 3 expansions and join us in the crusade to kill eachother!\n\nThis game is easily an 8/10, it's simply gaming bliss.","July 20, 2014","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you're like me you stumbled upon this by friends that either played the tabletop game, were into the lore or played this. As an RTS it is quite an entertaining one to play as you have your campagin of course which is really good as you play as a Space Marine chapter known as the Blood Ravens. It's even got a decent story to go with it since it takes place on a slowly chaotic planet filled with Orks, Eldar and Chaos Space Marines. I sort of wished the campaign was a little more varied in how you only play as Space Marines but it's still a rather competent campaign at that.\n\nThe game has lots of units to play as and often the game is territorial based meaning that you you have to keep moving and taking over relics and strategic points to get the resources you need to win the battle. It's a pretty good incentive instead of the usual building a huge army and steamrolling everything (not that steamrolling is fun but) it's refreshing to see a change in the RTS formula. When you're done with your campaign you have your skirmish modes where you play  against the AI with four factions to choose from (Space Marines, Chaos Space Marines, Eldar and Orks) and online mode where you play with friends and randoms which is quite nice and fun to play. Lastly you have your army painter which let's you customize your faction's armor and logo colour. It's cool but a little limited though not a lot of RTS games lets you do that.\n\nGood campaign, fun skirmishes and online play makes Dawn of War a worthy RTS to have in your collection. It's over 10 years old and as a recent newbie to the series it is still rather fun to pick up and play. I give it an 8/10.","July 19, 2015","true","18.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's just aged a great deal. It looks and feels bad. The soundtrack seems on par with the sequels though, and there seems to be plenty of story in the campaign, and a neat territorial conquest theme to the campaign that the DoW2 series did not have.\n\nNow, I'm typically not a fan of true RTS games, which might be why I feel like Dawn of War 2 was a vastly superior set of games in ALL ways, but I can understand that the first Dawn of War series of content here can hold some people's attention. They're definitely more focused on more multitasking and bigger squadrons. That kind of stuff honestly just hurts my brain. I much prefer DoW2's 4-Hero Unit campaign structure, and it's Last Stand mode (though now largely unplayed).\n\nAs far as multiplayer goes, I cannot comment, as I know my role there. I am no use to any team. That's probably where this first series shines, from what I hear.","September 25, 2015","false","2.9"," 5 of 21 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","5","21","0","0"

Graphics, even for the time, aren't that impressive, and voice acting quality is somewhere inbetween Bollywood and shady independent films. About 6 missions into the campaign, I got an army of tanks and infantry and sent them across the river. The tanks got trapped when an enemy unit walked into them and subsequently blocked the entire army from advancing across the river, and they also wouldn't fire their cannons- they just kept moving towards the *one* enemy squad and letting them into their blind spot. The enemy AI proceeded to destroy 3/4ths of my army, who would not shoot and were also stuck. Quite possibly the worst game Relic has ever released. However, this game DOES have its high points- you get a very large army, the tech tree is pretty cool, and just playing in the WH40K universe are all pretty cool. Due to the pathfinding problems and other issues, I personally won't recommend it, but don't be discouraged- it's still fun and there ARE workarounds to near everything (including graphics- use "forcehighpoly" to increase quality of the textures and details).So, to finish, this is a game that'll make you sit on the edge of your seat and also, at the same time, want to make you throw your computer out the window. I'll leave it to you guys to decide what you think of this game.\n\nEDIT: I'll be honest. If I were forced to pick, I'd choose this one over the sequel. The sequel kind of betrayed the RTS genre by reducing the size of everything and forcing micro-micro-micromanagement of your limited units. But I still stand by my belief that this game is buggy as hell, especially pathfinding wise. If Relic were to make another game that combined the graphics and (thank god) improved pathfinding from the 2nd game with the concept and scale of this one, I'd be so thankful.","July 31, 2015","false","16.5"," 4 of 22 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","4","22","0","0"

It hasn't aged very well at all. I can forgive the poor draw distance, and the chunky graphics, as technology moves on long after games have been made.\n\nYet... the story was pretty boring and by the book, which is a shame when you consider the huge amount of lore you can draw from the Warhammer Universe. Like other RTS before and after it, Dawn of War suffers from the ease in which you can build up a super army and just blitz your way through the map.\n\nThere are some nice animations and kill sequences within the game, which is a nice little touch.\n\nI'll give this game another go somewhere down the line and play Skirmmish/Multiplayer against other people, which I think will be a fairer reflection on what it has to offer.\nI do like the idea of the Army Painter tool to create unique paint designs.","October 13, 2013","false","18.1"," 10 of 56 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","10","56","0","1"

I am mostly writing this review to say not to buy Warhammer 40,000 because it is like any other strategy game on the market. I think consumers would be happier buying Warhammer 40,000 (2) as the gameplay is less repetative and more exciting sicne your squad mates use cover and throw grenades to take over vital positions (kind of like Company of Heroes mixed with Starcraft). I would have been fine skipping on the first 3 Warhammer 40,000 games and just owning Retribution 2 with all of its expansions.

These games are so amazing and the tutorials make it easily accessible with easy to follow instructions and info on how to command units  and supply resources. I also highly reccomend company of heroes 1 and 2 a WWII RTS. Another GAMES WORKSHOP thq developed game wich is highly acclaimed as one of the highest rated RTS's of all time! I love these  type of games as im am huge sci-fi and fantasy NERD and this has both. I have been so burnt out with the FPS and same old fantasy rpg story genre "generic" these last few years 12,13, that i decided to try out a different genre and im glad i did cause theres a lot of great games in this genre and warhammer 40k has a lot of them. Its not the best looking game but it is 7 years old now and i think it holds up well. the gameplay is still great and is what got me hooked on 40k and RTS games. its extremely fun and immersive i just love this universe and have already purchused some of the books.  I give D.O.W. GOTY edition a 9.25/10. for its time a great game!","December 25, 2013","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are two main resources: Power and requisition. Requisition is used to make buildings, units, upgrades. The same can also be said of power, which generates slower. To acquire these resources you need to capture points on the map and hold them. You can field a variety of units including infantry, land vehicles, heroes and super heavy unit. All units cost requisition to make. Upgrades are also available for purchase from buildings. You can upgrade squad with weapons or more members.\n\nThere are two modes to play with: Campaign and skirmish. Campaign follows Captain Gabriel Angelos of the Blood Ravens chapter of space marines as he faces off against the orc horde. Unlike the latter entries to the series, the campaign is set into levels.  Each level of the campaign starts you off with a few units. Your goal is to build a base and then an army to accomplish various objectives. Such objectives are split between primary and secondary ones and involve either destroying a specific building or enemy unit. Completing all primary objectives will win the level, while secondary ones are optional. Skirmish mode has you face off against up to 7 players/bots in game modes such as annihilation and victory point capture. There are a total of 4 races available to play as including Eldar, Space marines, Orcs and Chaos. The other expansion packs (ie Dark Crusade, Winter Assault, Soulstorm) will allow you to select more races to play as and against, should you acquire them.\n\nAudio is excellent. The weapon sound effects feel as they should. Background music fits well with combat. Voice acting for campaign (as units) are well done.\n\nIf you are looking for a good RTS game with lots of action or you are interested in the 40K universe, this is where to start.\n","April 30, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983662248/recommended/4570/","76561197983662248","TechieRefugee","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983662248/","714 products in account","To start: I used to add a much longer header to these reviews, but since it often made the reviews too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery.\n\nGameplay: One thing that's very difficult not to do when talking about any base-building RTS, let alone a military Sci-Fi RTS, is to not compare it to Starcraft, especially considering the influence that the Warhammer 40k world present in Starcraft. After all, there's a race of humans kinda like the Terrans, there's an alien race like the Protoss, and while not present in this game, there is a race similar to the Zerg. Also much like Starcraft, the gameplay is centered around building bases.\n\nThe differences come in, as you might expect, with the gameplay. While this is something of a personal taste, I really do quite like how resources are handled in this game. Your two basic resources are Requisition (kinda like Minerals) and Power (kinda like Vespene). You gain requisition from controlling Strategic Points on the map. It is also from these Strategic Points that you build your base, from which you can build in a radius that expands up to a certain point. Unlike Starcraft, you gain resources at a set rate per minute, which is slow enough to require you to think about what you wanna build, as opposed to spamming harvesters all day. Power is gained from building generators, and much like Requisition, is gained at a set rate per minute. There are also Slag Deposits on some maps, which you can capture and build a special generator on, allowing a bit more strategy with your expansion.\n\nUnits are produced in squads, and vehicles have their own unit cap outside of the squad unit cap. With some research, you can increase your squad cap to 20, and your vehicle cap to 10. While this doesn't sound like much, keep in mind that each squad can have up to ten people in it, reaching Starcraft's famous 200 unit limit very easily, and surpassing it with vehicle count. I do wish that your construction units didn't count as one squad, which can be especially obnoxious as there is no way of recalling your construction units other than sending them out to maybe punch the enemy's base or something.\n\nWhile the game doesn't necessarily have as many units as Starcraft, the matter of unit composition is largely handled by equipment. Your basic squad can be outfitted with four different special weapons, of which each squad can have up to four specially equipped members. Another aspect to this game is its Morale system, in which you can use particularly gruesome attacks to break apart squads, leaving them easy for the pickings as well as discouraging some easy rushes from time to time.\n\nThe single player campaign is somewhat disappointing, as it only features the Space Marines. I'll talk more about the story later, but for now know that there aren't Eldar, Ork or Chaos Marine campaigns (Eldar being the kinda-Protoss race and Necron being the unlisted kinda-Zerg race). There are apparently campaigns in the expansions, but since I haven't played them yet, I can't speak for them.\n\nNow, we come to the important question: how fun is the game? This was my first "legit" introduction to the Real-Time Strategy genre, and I gotta say; I picked a damn good game to start out with. The gameplay is very streamlined, there's usually a great bit of action going on at any one time, and the mechanics are simple enough on the surface while still having a good bit of depth to it for people to play for quite some time. If you're looking for an RTS to get someone's feet wet with, I can very easily recommend this one over Starcraft (although Starcraft may take a bit of weening into) for first timers to the genre. Simple on the surface, deep underneath, very streamlined and just overall a hell of a lot of fun to play. 9/10.\n\nStory: Since the completion of this game, I've gone on and read some more of the Warhammer 40k lore, and I've gotta be honest; the campaign doesn't do the series justice. The content is kinda neat, and the Orks are still fun to watch bumble about, but for the Space Marines, this game doesn't do very good in showcasing just how grand their empire is. It feels kinda... fanfic-y, in a not so great way. They try to do some intrigue, but it just doesn't work, and the cliffhanger at the end is, to be quite frank, inexcusable. While the dialogue and writing in-game is good, the actual story itself just isn't good. At all. Disappointing. 6/10.\n\nGraphics: Unfortunately, to get this game to run at 1080p I had to download some modded files, which may trigger anti-cheat protection if you happen to play multiplayer. Also, running these files breaks the HUD for the Space Marines (although strangely not for any of the other races). It's frustrating, and I really would expect Sega to get around to making 1080p available in-game without any modding required. Despite this, the game looks pretty good for a 2004 game. Unit design is pretty neat, most of the areas that you visit throughout the campaign look really cool, and of course, seeing an Ork mech tear a Space Marine in half is just plain awesome. I never suffered any frame drops, which is always nice for an older game, as older games around this generation like to depend entirely on your integrated graphics chip if you happen to have one, leaving your GPU idling uselessly. 4.5 for not having 1080p available by default, but the half point comes in because a mod is very easy to download and install.\n\nSound: The voice acting during the cutscenes isn't bad, but it's not exactly award winning work either. Voice acting in battle is pretty good, though, especially for the Orks (I may also have a bit of an Ork bias). The music is pretty excellent as well, and is definitely memorable. It's pretty much entirely orchestral, but it's very "heavy," with loads of brass and percussion; just the way I like my orchestras. Apart from that, there's not much else to talk about here. Good stuff. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 9/6/4.5/4; cumulative score of 7.8/10. Again, the biggest problem with the game is the campaign being kinda not good, but at least skirmishing is a lot of fun. Still though, the campaign is disappointing, especially considering that Relic made Homeworld.","April 25, 2015","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You build more buildings which give you access to units and abilities. You can then uprgrade units and building to improve your army. To build buildings or units you need resources which can be acquired by capturing points and buildng power stations. Buildings, units, abilities and playstyles change according to the race that you choose. In the original Dawn of War, you have access to 4 races: Space Marines, Chaos, Orcs and Eldar.\nIn the single player campaign mode, you play as the Space Marines in a story driven campaign. The storyline is interesting enough to keep you engaged and maps are varied enough to stay interesting for whatever difficulty level you have selected.\nThere are also single player scenarios, where you pick and any army and map and then play. Also there is online multiplayer to play with human opponents. Maps can hold between 2 and 8 players who can be divided into teams if desired.\nThere is also a customiser where you can choose a race and customise the look of your units and buildings to create a unique looking army for yourself.\nThere are also 3 expansions which further build on this: Winter Assault, Dark Crusade and Soulstorm.\n\nWinter Assault features new maps, storyline and the addition of the Imperial Guard race. The storyline features the option to play through it as Good (Imperial Guard and Eldar) or Evil (Chaos and Orks) with an ending that changes depending on who you pick to play the final mission with.\n\nDark Crusade again features completely new maps, storyline, addition of the Tau race and the Necron race as well as new units for existing races. The single player game is changed slightly as you now have an overworld view of the planet that all these races are fighting on. You choose which areas you wish to battle in first. The more areas you acquire, the more resources that are open to you. You can also acquire honor guard units (rare powerful hero units) as well as equipment to give to your race's leader, which enhances their stats and abilities. This gives the game a pseudo-RPG element. You eliminate other races by invading their home region and taking it, but they can do the same to do.\nAgain, the storyline is engaging enough, but not as immersive or as intense as in the previous games.\n\nSoulstorm once again builds further on what has come before by featuring more completely new maps, storyline, addition of the Sisters of Battle race and the Dark Eldar race, as well as even more units for existing races. The single layer features an overworld view of several planets and maintains the pseudo-RPG elements of Dark Crusade.\n\nOverall, this is a great strategy series to get is you are a fan of the genre or of Warhammer 40000 in general.","December 28, 2012","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaign is a blast to play and the multiplayer support from Steam is awesome. Though the expansions to this, the first game of the franchise make it progressively better, it is well worth the time to revisit this classic.\n\nGraphics - 7/10 For its time the graphics were solid, though this is the one aspect of the game I would say hasn't aged well. Still very passable, and looks alright when zoomed out.\n\nGameplay - 9/10 Soulstorm is where it's at if you are looking for multi, but the campaign of the initial release is still a lot of fun.\n\nSound - 7/10 The voice acting was a nice inclusion, and imparted the story effectively. Some of the sound effects had a hollow tinny ring to them however.\n\nDev Support - 11/10 I think it is simply awesome how commited Relic is to continued support of the titles of this franchise. They may be a bit older, but the quality has not diminished with age. They are doing their best to make sure that the Steam version works with mods, and that we all can continue to enjoy head-to-head play.","September 6, 2014","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Units come in squads, you can resupply squads in the field, units shoot without you having to tell them to shoot, capture points, attaching heroes and healers to squads, upgrading. This all made it feel different and exciting and also very much like a Warhammer 40k game (Not a big 40k fan, but WH Fantasy fan, definitely).\n\nThe story is ♥♥♥♥, the voice acting atrocious, but the gameplay makes up for that.

Look no further than Warhammer. This long-running series started out in the '80s as a tabletop strategy game, and transitioned to computer games not long after. The Dawn of War series takes place in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and will have a very familiar feel to anyone who has played Blizzard's popular RTS games. No doubt you're already familiar with Space Marines and Orks. You'll find plenty of them here. Starcraft's Protoss and Zerg drew their inspiration from Warhammer's Eldar and Tyranid races, respectively. You'll also find several other factions unique to Warhammer, including the corrupt Chaos Marines, the undead robotic Necron, and the alien Tau. Even though the Dawn of War series was originally released in 2004, it still stands the test of time, and the many expansion packs keep things fresh and interesting. If you're a fan of any sci-fi RTS games, you'll love Dawn of War.","February 16, 2012","true","34.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaign has a very good story that borrows a lot from the actual WH franchise, so those familiar with the Space Marines should have a lot to look forward too. The plot's fleshed out by interesting and some what lengthy cutscenes before and after each mission. The voice actors in the game are very over the top and sometimes cheesy, but they manage to fit each character well and the voice acting actually comes away as a very bright spot in the game for me.\n\nGame-play wise there isn't a whole lot of 'new' here compared to other RTS games, but what is included is polished. For its release date I consider the game to be very technically capable with things like decent character animations and solid over-all performance.

This game makes me wonder why I haven't played more.  All fans of RTS should give this one a shot.  There's a good variety of units, base building isn't a grind, and the Warhammer series IMHO has THE BEST balance of any strategy games I've ever played.  You get into the action quickly and new units are introduced pretty much as soon as you're ready for them.\n\nI'll put this one up against Starcraft (which I feel is a good benchmark for RTS games) any day of the week.  My only recommendation would be to get the expansion packs too if you can.  The campaign is 11 missions long and seemed to go by too quickly to me.  However, that may have been because I enjoyed the game so much.","August 23, 2014","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is fantastic for an RTS, you have only two types of resources, requisition and power so you have to go out and capture requisition points and defend them to maintain a source of requisition, this keeps you in constant conflict with the other factions as they need it as much as you.\n\nThis kind of "Need for war", makes the game so action packed for a strategy game. There are only 4 factions, and each of them with different units and abilities. The campaign was great, both in story and battles, but it's a shame that they only made a campaign for the Space Marines.\n\nOverall, this is a great example of a Real Time Strategy game, one with an extensive lore behind it and innovative gameplay.","April 5, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Look no further than Warhammer. This long-running series started out in the '80s as a tabletop strategy game, and transitioned to computer games not long after. The Dawn of War series takes place in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and will have a very familiar feel to anyone who has played Blizzard's popular RTS games. No doubt you're already familiar with Space Marines and Orks. You'll find plenty of them here. Starcraft's Protoss and Zerg drew their inspiration from Warhammer's Eldar and Tyranid races, respectively. You'll also find several other factions unique to Warhammer, including the corrupt Chaos Marines, the undead robotic Necron, and the alien Tau. Even though the Dawn of War series was originally released in 2004, it still stands the test of time, and the many expansion packs keep things fresh and interesting.

For playing in 1280 x 1024, even stretched to wide-screen, I can't say I noticed any truly painful spots. In a world of 8-bit indies, it's downright gorgeous.\n\nAppearances to the side, the gameplay grabbed me right up - and more than just the gameplay, the atmosphere! Listening to the Space Marines call to one another, shouting their battle-cries to the accompaniment of a moving and powerful musical score... well, it's easy to remember why it was so brilliant back in the day.\n\nTHQ, the original publisher, is long gone. SEGA appears to hold the game now. Either way, Relic has been incredibly aware and active in the Steam forums, replacing Gamespy, repairing patches that damaged mods, and listening to the community in general. Relic won my heart with the original Homeworld game, and I'm glad to see that they're still a positive force in gaming.\n\nIf you're looking for a good RTS, a blast from a great past, or even just some Warhammer 40K, it would be hard to go wrong with Dawn of War.

The only problem is the humans are only really capable of fighting either the Orc or "Chaos Space Marine" factions, which have similar fighting capabilities and play styles. One faction, the Eldar, have an annoying ability to jump around the map using "web gates" or "web portals," showing up unexpectedly just about anywhere. If you are playing against the computer, it seems as if the AI knows when your own armies are away from your base, or jump amazing close to your base. This complicates matters because this game is something like "capture the flag," rather than hanging out at your base being a "soccer/football goalie," just defending your structures.

The campaign has a very good story that borrows a lot from the actual WH franchise, so those familiar with the Space Marines should have a lot to look forward too. The plot's fleshed out by interesting and some what lengthy cutscenes before and after each mission. The voice actors in the game are very over the top and sometimes cheesy, but they manage to fit each character well and the voice acting actually comes away as a very bright spot in the game for me.\n\nGame-play wise there isn't a whole lot of 'new' here compared to other RTS games, but what is included is polished. For its release date I consider the game to be very technically capable with things like decent character animations and solid over-all performance. Fans of RTS games or the Warhammer franchise should definitely give this one a shot.","January 11, 2013","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The AI sometimes has pathing issues, and on occasion there are times were the campaign makes odd choices with some of your units (such as putting the Whirlwind artillery tanks in the Cease Fire stance by default).

These games are so amazing and the tutorials make it easily accessible with easy to follow instructions and info on how to command units  and supply resources. I also highly reccomend company of heroes 1 and 2 a WWII RTS. Another GAMES WORKSHOP thq developed game wich is highly acclaimed as one of the highest rated RTS's of all time! I love these  type of games as im am huge sci-fi and fantasy NERD and this has both. I have been so burnt out with the FPS and same old fantasy rpg story genre "generic" these last few years 12,13, that i decided to try out a different genre and im glad i did cause theres a lot of great games in this genre and warhammer 40k has a lot of them. Its not the best looking game but it is 7 years old now and i think it holds up well. the gameplay is still great and is what got me hooked on 40k and RTS games. its extremely fun and immersive i just love this universe and have already purchused some of the books.  I give D.O.W. GOTY edition a 9.25/10. for its time a great game!","December 25, 2013","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Warhammer 40k Dawn of War - Game of the Year Edition doesn't include Winter Assault and any other expansions. GotY edition is kinda misleading here, since in most games it means that there is every DLC/expansion/add-on etc. included.\n\nWarhammer 40.000: Dawn of War was one of first games I owned on Steam. I remember when I bought it shortly after release (box edition) and for some reason I thought it would be cool to start somehow with Steam. And here I got it. Didn't spend then much time playing (just a few mission and skirmish) and I moved along to other games. Few days ago I wanted to recall how amazing first Dawn of War game is. Even after almost 10 years this strategy game looks amazing. It didn't get old at all. The main story maybe isn't the longer in strategy games (just 11 missions) but the harder difficulty level you play on, the more fun it is. There are much more skirmish maps, where you can play with much more players/ai and have even more fun. Not just as Space Marines, but also as Orks or Chaos Space Marines. If skirmish and story aren't enough for you, there is also multiplayer! It still have active community, so if you want a great strategy game for online purpose, I think Warhammer 40k Dawn of War is good choice too. Hardcore fans of Warhammer will probably happy with one more think - army painter.\n\nIn my opinion, Warhammer 40.000: Dawn of War is one of these games that should be played by every gamer. And if you call yourself a fan of strategy games then you must play it.","August 3, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nine years later, those feelings are still going strong.\n\nFor the uninitiated, turtling is the notion of erecting a stiff defensive perimeter, absorbing enemy attacks while establishing one's own economy, then lashing out with the full fury of one's tech tree and crushing the enemy in a swift show of force. Dawn of War's most effective strategy is what I like to call "Turbo Turtle" because of its resource mechanics. Unlike most games which require players to harvest resources from the game world in something of a parallel operation to the military stuff, the two mix together in the form of requisition, gained automatically from capturing various points around the map. This system keeps the game moving because no resource infrastructure is required to build infantry units. Just take a squad or two, capture some points, and you're off and rolling. These points can even have fortifications built on them, keepinig enemies at bay long enough for a force away from the flashpoint to react and engage and allowing the player to hold large swathes of territory (and resources) without desperately trying to get every detail just so to prevent exploits in the defense. (The other resource, power, is produced entirely within the tech tree with bonus areas available on most maps, meaning any shortage is usually self-created.) This keeps the game moving at a reasonable pace and prevents players from turtling for 20-30 minutes while advancing to the next tech level like one might in other RTS titles. This simplified approach keeps the focus on combat and battle tactics rather than letting resource gathering linger in the back of the player's mind.\n\nThe game also doesn't have players building infantry units piecemeal; instead, infantry come in squads which can be expanded and outfitted with heavy weaponry. The Space Marines - the sole faction the player uses in the campaign - have such powerful infantry that most early missions and even skirmish games can be won with 4-5 decked out squads of their mainline infantry, and the squad as the base unit can result in infantry combat on a massive scale at the climax of a battle. Five full squads of Space Marines puts 45 units under the player's control; mainline infantry for the other races churns out even more individuals, and it's all commanded at the squad level, so, again, no micromanagement.\n\nThe visuals were quite good for the time, although they haven't held up very well in the nine years since the game's original release. The upside to this is a lack of lag or chug on most modern PCs, even when the battles reach their most frenzied. There are fewer positives to be found with the story (quite dull and rather predictable) and the sound design (the voice acting is downright painful at times), but playing an RTS for the story is like eating a cheeseburger for the pickles; it's nice to have the extra flavor, but it's not really why you bought the burger.\n\nRelic hit a home run with this game. Not only did they capture the essence of Warhammer 40,000 and its lore, they also made it something players new to 40k will be interested in and enjoy without getting bogged down in trying to bring 40k's rules to a video game, something other GW-inspired titles (read: Blood Bowl) could stand to learn from. Fun is the most important element of any game, and Dawn of War provides plenty of it. For the Emprah!","August 4, 2015","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In short, Dawn Of War is an RTS that contains:\n\n- 9 Incredibly unique factions ranging from the undead/robotic necron, who do not require requisitions but need to build massive amounts of power to sustain themselves to the legendary Warhammer Space Marines, the super soldiers who define the series with their powerful leadership units and decent unit composition making impossible fights slightly more possible (Though the expansions are needed for 5 of them, by default you get Orks, Chaos Marines, Space Marines, and Eldar though they are pretty unique and can in themselves offer hundreds of hours of gameplay).\n\n-Interesting game modes such as the standard destroy the enemy's base ranging to hold various points for a set amount of time or even just slay the enemy commander before yours falls. Plus, you can set more than one victory parameter for maximum gameplay and strategic influence.\n\n-Expansions that change the singleplayer experience (Soulstorm and Dark Crusade) to a map takeover in which all of the game's factions wage war and fight numerous matches attacking and defending territory with troops they earned throughout the campaign and even their fation specific commander his/herself.\n\nIn the end, it is an amazing game well worth your time, though I do suggest getting the expansions as they make the already great game even better.","July 10, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In short, Dawn Of War is an RTS that contains:\n\n- 9 Incredibly unique factions ranging from the undead/robotic necron, who do not require requisitions but need to build massive amounts of power to sustain themselves to the legendary Warhammer Space Marines, the super soldiers who define the series with their powerful leadership units and decent unit composition making impossible fights slightly more possible (Though the expansions are needed for 5 of them, by default you get Orks, Chaos Marines, Space Marines, and Eldar though they are pretty unique and can in themselves offer hundreds of hours of gameplay).\n\n-Interesting game modes such as the standard destroy the enemy's base ranging to hold various points for a set amount of time or even just slay the enemy commander before yours falls. Plus, you can set more than one victory parameter for maximum gameplay and strategic influence.\n\n-Expansions that change the singleplayer experience (Soulstorm and Dark Crusade) to a map takeover in which all of the game's factions wage war and fight numerous matches attacking and defending territory with troops they earned throughout the campaign and even their fation specific commander his/herself.\n\nIn the end, it is an amazing game well worth your time, though I do suggest getting the expansions as they make the already great game even better.","July 10, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've reinstalled I don't know how many times, but I feel like I got screwed out of my money, and it goes the same for Winter Assault. The only Dawn of War game that works is Soulstorm, DoW II and DoW II Chaos Rising. I wish I could ask for my money back now.","September 8, 2015","false","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, Soulstorm, it all started here. Even the original Company of Heroes, which was not just better than it's buggy, DLC-bait sequel, but a near-perfect example of an RTS game, was a direct evolution of Dawn of War.\n\nAll 4 races are actually pretty well-balanced in multiplayer (better-balanced than the source material is nowdays!). The campaign story is great, and fits the Warhammer 40,000 lore perfectly, which makes it a good introduction, if a bit predictable for the already-initiated (if you went in knowing the lore, you knew X was manipulating Y against Z long before the main characters had a clue Z was involved).\n\nThis came out right when I first started getting into the actual 40k tabletop game, and the original Rome: Total War followed soon after. My 10th-grade GPA could've been a full point higher, but on top of learning 40k and painting my first army, autumn of 2004 was an RTS golden age we will probably never see the like of again.\n\nExcept here.

Look no further than Warhammer. This long-running series started out in the '80s as a tabletop strategy game, and transitioned to computer games not long after. The Dawn of War series takes place in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and will have a very familiar feel to anyone who has played Blizzard's popular RTS games. No doubt you're already familiar with Space Marines and Orks. You'll find plenty of them here. Starcraft's Protoss and Zerg drew their inspiration from Warhammer's Eldar and Tyranid races, respectively. You'll also find several other factions unique to Warhammer, including the corrupt Chaos Marines, the undead robotic Necron, and the alien Tau. Even though the Dawn of War series was originally released in 2004, it still stands the test of time, and the many expansion packs keep things fresh and interesting. If you're a fan of any sci-fi RTS games, you'll love Dawn of War.","February 16, 2012","true","34.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These games are so amazing and the tutorials make it easily accessible with easy to follow instructions and info on how to command units  and supply resources. I also highly reccomend company of heroes 1 and 2 a WWII RTS. Another GAMES WORKSHOP thq developed game wich is highly acclaimed as one of the highest rated RTS's of all time! I love these  type of games as im am huge sci-fi and fantasy NERD and this has both. I have been so burnt out with the FPS and same old fantasy rpg story genre "generic" these last few years 12,13, that i decided to try out a different genre and im glad i did cause theres a lot of great games in this genre and warhammer 40k has a lot of them. Its not the best looking game but it is 7 years old now and i think it holds up well. the gameplay is still great and is what got me hooked on 40k and RTS games. its extremely fun and immersive i just love this universe and have already purchused some of the books.  I give D.O.W. GOTY edition a 9.25/10. for its time a great game!","December 25, 2013","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
