Put on high for two minutes.\n\n*WHIRRR*\n\nThis is the result. A gorgeous, whisky-soaked blend of a game where pilots drink greel distilled alcohol, where antimatter specks are used for deviant practices, and where combat takes place on a horizontal plane straight out of Assassins' Creed : Black Flag, on crack. All handled with the colour and panache of the original Torchlight, which exploded out of nowhere and revitalised the Dungeon Crawler genre. This promises, and mostly succeeds in doing the same for space exploration.\n\nI'm a leaf on the wind, I'm a leaf on the wind!\nIn the time honoured tradition of all space exploration games everywhere, you are thrown into a starter ship, in this case, a dinky little corvette with a few broadside cannons, a few turrets, and a hull made of papier mache and shields made of soap suds. It is your job to find your Aunt Juno, who so very kindly left you this ship, and find out why you've been dragged out to the tail end of space, which is full of the scum of the universe, and work your way up the foodchain, blowing up said scum and villainy, and eventually become owner of a pimped up ship of doom and destruction. Depending on your playstyle this may be a top notch destroyer, with speed and agility and tons of guns, or a dreadnaught with a horrifying number of broadsides, or a heavy hauler with enough armour to qualify as having it's own gravitational pull.\n\nOr, y'know, you could buy a strike craft and try to outrun bullets, but that's for the clinically insane. Even top level shields and good guns won't allow you to toe it with the enemy dreadnaughts for -long-, but hey, whatever flicks your switch!\n\nMiner, trader, soldier, sailor...\nRebel galaxy gives you a very, very diverse set of tools to work with, you can tool up for mining with lasers and fault scanners, or you can go full out commodity trader, and the economy is set up enough to actually handle that, with system averages and station histories that actually work properly and can be scanned from out of station across the system, allowing you to set up profitable trade routes back and forth. This can pay off very nicely once you have a high capacity hauler, particularly if that hauler has one of the contraband cargo expansions which means you can facilitate life as a smuggler on the side.\n\nOr you can just blow things up, because explosions are pretty. Blowing things up always work, and there's a terrifying variety of weapons, not just purchasable, but also lootable unique variants which can be discovered in the world, in loot crates or from the hulls of pirate lords, if you feel like converting them to scrap metal.\n\nThe pool is wide, but not QUITE as deep as space promises...\nRebel Galaxy offers a -lot- of activities, and offers enough in each activity to have you happily whiling away your time, moreso than Elite Dangerous did (and yes, I know many E;D fans who are going to burn me for that, but it's true), the mining is more sensibly handled due to the tractor beams, the combat is more visceral and less grindy, the trading makes more sense and doesn't require an excel spreadsheet to get the best out of. There's a real economy, and you don't need to be online to get the most out of the game.\n\nThere are -two- buts to this rather delicious soup.\n\nOne : The factions - They are present, but they're rather bland. More time and depth could have been put into them, faction exclusive ships for each faction would have been glorious, along with modules, as well as faction exclusive bases that you could dock at, along with missions and different reactions based on standing, as well as more complex interrelations between said factions. Right now you basically have only two paths you can follow. If there's anything that could exponentially increase the lifespan of this game - Faction DLC would do it. This would convert a 20-40 hour game to a 200-400 hour game. No joke.\n\nTwo : Whilst the activities are good, they all tend to peter out once you get out past the destroyer mark, and the fact you can only hire gunship level mercenaries puts a hard cap on the kind of fights they can throw at you. Hiring capital level mercenaries would have solved this. Again, faction DLC for the win here.\n\nFinal thoughts...\nDo these two issues stop this game from being anything other than excellent? No. It's still a bloody great game, and for the price point they're charging it's an absolute steal. It does however prevent me from slamming the "Essential" badge on, because I know that the devs could quite possibly get the Factions some love, and make this "the" game to beat. Hint hint. It does, however, easily merit being a game that people should look into, especially if you're someone who loved Freelancer, or similar games.\n\nVerdict : Highly Recommended\n\nWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

Bought it because of the soundtrack in the trailers... Took a gamble and hoped it would give me some entertainment... Man was I surprised...\n\nSooo.... Breaking it down:\n\n1. You will feel like a frikking space cowboy.\n2. Music so damn good that you want the soundtrack in every possible format.\n3. The sheer size of this game is just shocking! Did NOT expect that when I started it.\n4. Broadside battles between two large spaceships might be the coolest thing ever.\n5. BROADSIDES!!!! (It´s so damn cool I had to mention it twice!).\n6. Voice actors are actually kind of good for a game thats not a AAA.\n7. Did I mention broadsides?\n8. Simple, but complex.\n9. One bug, ONE(1!), found during my entire playthrough. EA, Bethesda, Bohemian and just about everyone else, LOOK AT THESE GUYS AND LEARN!!! It was not even a gamebreaking bug! All it did was made me crash into a station after warp and my ship autodocked, which I had planned to do anyway so the bug actually made me save some time since I didn´t have to "slowboat" all the way after warp.\n\nDownsides then? Yeah a few actually, but many of them is just me being picky.\n\n1. Game gets repetetive after a while and considering how many ships there is you may just finish the story halfway through the ship line.\n2. Main story line is waaay to easy.\n3. Considering it´s a space game, you may actually believe there would be free flight in all directions... like up and down... but nope! ship stays leveled and all you need to think about is right, left, back and forward... However this is forgiven thanks to the awesomeness of broadside battles.\n4. Soundtrack makes this game, without it (sometimes the music stops) it just feels empty.\n5. Characters kind of lacked depth and you probably won´t get too attached to them.\n\nDespite the downsides I still give this game a solid 7/10. It has the right "feel" to it and It´s absolutely one of those "If this gets a sequel, the devs will get it all right" kind of game.","December 23, 2015","true","16.2"," 496 of 517 people (96%) found this review helpful 71 people found this review funny","96","496","517","71","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atxferret/recommended/290300/","atxferret","ATX Ferret","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atxferret/","156 products in account","This is the most fun that I've had with a spaceship-based combat game since Freelancer and, before that, X-Wing vs Tie Fighter.  I have not beaten it yet, but these are my impressions so far.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe PRICE. This game plays like a $60 AAA title.\nFast-paced combat in capital ships that actually includes you piloting instead of just giving commands.\nMain storyline makes you want to learn more.\nQWERTY controls are downright elegant - I own a controller but have no desire to use it.\nNo Z-Axis - I understand some people refuse to buy the game for this reason but, not only is it unnecessary, it would also make the game extremely awkward considering the types of ships you're flying. You won't miss it, trust me.\nYoung game, but so far, almost entirely bug free.\nEpic blues soundtrack that changes songs depending on what you're doing in game. Fast music for fights, cruising music for, well, cruising.\nThe game world feels like Firefly would if it would have had a lot more in-space pewpew and also aliens. Lots of aliens.\nEnough ship customization, but not so much that you feel like you need an encyclopedia. (looking at you, EVE)\nBits and pieces of humor throughout.\nGraphics are pretty, if not necessarily stunning.\nThe galaxy is persistent, living, and breathing, and things are happening that have nothing whatsoever to do with you, which can cause interesting results.\nThe Not-As-Good:\nThey're not planning on expansions or DLC or anything, last I heard, and there have been zero updates to the game since launch, though that was only 15 days ago. I'd like to think there's a big content patch in the works or something, but I have no evidence for that. The game is, however, absolutely stable, as far as I can tell, so maybe they're just considering it finished. (edit - as of 11/17/15, they have released a small patch)\nRunning missions to keep your ship powerful enough to take on the next story element might be too reptitive for some, though I'm enjoying it.\nEscort missions are still kind of broken. I just did one where my client's destination was to a base that was aggressive to him, presumably because the base was aggressive to me. I don't know any reason a merchant would purposely go to a station whose defenses were going to shred him. On the first attempt, there was also a BIG fleet, and I didn't get credit for the mission because he got blown up. On the second attempt, no fleet, so although the station's defenses opened fire on us both, I got credit for the mission just before the merchant ship exploded. So I looted him and flew off, getting both the merchant's cargo and the pay for the escort. Amusing, but obviously not what the developers intended.\nIs this worth your $20? Absolutely. Zero question. Even if you don't particularly like these types of games, the lack of Z-axis might actually do it for you. It makes the game feel a lot less nauseating to those who typically can't handle the extra plane, and eliminates the circling buzzard effect that tends to plague starfighter-based games (Elite: Dangerous, looking at you).\n\nThere's something about running straight at a ship three times your size, turning and opening up your cannons and just shredding them that is immensely and uniquely gratifying while some fast-paced, hard-core electric guitar plays on queue, and the pirate-lord screams "No...no-no-no-NO!" then blows up, leaving behind a rare piece of ship equipment.","November 14, 2015","true","62.8"," 234 of 242 people (97%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","97","234","242","28","0"

To many this will be a deal breaker.\n\nBut wait!\n\nI tell you this game is a blast if you give it a chance. It will have you on the edge of your seat having a good old time as you learn the finer points of capital ship combat, and die in the process. The save system is very forgiving and you can have multiple playthroughs going at once (rename your ship to keep the saves separate is a good tip).\n\nThere are mission boards with side missions and a main story line, commodities trading, tons of action and nothing a well timed deflector shield button press can't solve!  Lots of upgrades, weapons, shields, deflectors, various parts of the ship can be upgraded as well. Just enough depth in missions and main story to keep you going and the action can be intense. Also, each time you start the world you start in front seems to be based on some RNG combo as it's been different the 3 times my son and I started new games. Haven't done any comparisons for the rest of the "universe"\n\nJust make sure you are going in with the right expectations and I would expect you to find this game addicting and rewarding. Get it on sale and you won't be sorry!  Also, the music is awesome, just let the game load and the title screen run and it can be amazing on it's own!\n\nHere's a good example of an early experience:\n\nFlying an early ship with shields and deflector, trying to get a few side missions and upgrade my weapons. I pick up a dead drop and 4 fighter craft, all pirates, drop in on me and my hired Mercenary. we kick in our engines and split up, both targeting the same ship from different sides, blowing it out of.....space? Not air certainly! Anyway, it's a quick fight and we dispatch them easy, going to hyperspace and heading to take the dead drop back.\n\nSuddenly we get interdicted out of hypersace and it's pirates agian, but much worse as it's two medium sized cruisers with fighter escort.  Trying to isolate one target at a time we fight a retreating battle, luring the fighters away from the cruisers and trying to divide and conquer.\n\nThe cruisers are having none of it and their thrusters flare as they quickly close the distance and open fire. Our shields are taking heavy damage and missiles are coming in (thank goodness for flak guns and deflector shields) when a militia destroyer warps in with fighter escort and opens fire on the pirate cruisers. Our 2 ships and the local constables, basically, wipe out the pirates in a fierce but ultimately one sided battle. The militia ship scans us after, tells us to move along and we head on our way to finish the mission.\n\nPhew!  Good times!\n\nPlease remember this is 2 dimensional, left right only movement of your ship, but trust me it works and the game is actually quite a lot of fun!","October 23, 2015","true","38.2"," 249 of 262 people (95%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","95","249","262","15","10"

Very simple and easy to get into, whilst yet providing enough customisability and choice to justify the "open world" tag, it drew me in from the first five minutes and kept me completely immersed until the endgame. It has an easy learning curve, but it doesn't sacrifice complexity overmuch.\nVery pretty graphics and gratifying sound - the soundtrack, by the way, is PERFECT. And even if you don't like it, it has an amazing feature of being able to choose your own music, and assign it to different in-game scenarios. Reeeeeally nice touch.\nThe story is quite an interesting one for sci-fi fans, and there is a surprising amount of speech/animation for a game at this price point - enough to make it a genuinely fun campaign. There is even replay value in the amount of choice in factions and weaponry.\nThe only issue I have is that it's too short, in that the game initially hints at a large amount of content - ships; weapons; star systems, etc. and then simply makes these things very time-consuming to attain, and the end of the line- best ship; best weapons; final star system, happens a bit too soon, with the endgame lying on predictable lines from the progression set out on at the start.\nTo sum up - extreme value for money here - just don't forget you're not playing an AAA title, like I did, and be disappointed that it ends too soon.","May 5","true","111.7"," 147 of 157 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","147","157","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krayzkrok/recommended/290300/","krayzkrok","krayzkrok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krayzkrok/","523 products in account","This is easily one of the year's best games, combining the atmosphere and open "do what you like" dynamics of Freelancer, with combat similar to Starfleet Command / Black Flag (like those games your ship is restricted to the same plane, so this isn't a hardcore space sim, but it serves the gameplay well). The vibe is very much like Firefly, mostly due to the excellent grungy soundtrack, but also the look and feel of the ships, stations, and frontier-mentality characters that you meet. It works so well because the core gameplay is hugely enjoyable. Combat is dynamic and in-your-face, ships and missiles explode and shake the screen, lasers sear the side of your ship, damage is nicely modelled so that surviving a brutal encounter feels like you escaped by the skin of your teeth, your hull blackened, components shorting out, systems breaking down as you hurry to find repairs. I've spent most of my time doing missions from the bulletin boards rather than following the story, that's how much fun it all is.\n\nThe universe is procedurally generated every time you start a new game, which certainly gives it legs, although to be honest the game is pretty large in scope; you'll spend at least 10 hours in the starting system, and there are many more after that. The difficulty at first is quite high, but it doesn't take long to get the hang of how combat works, and a few early upgrades will help you feel badass. Merceneries can be hired if you're still having trouble.\n\nThere's more to the game than combat though, mining is actually a lot of fun (unlike Elite: Dangerous where it's sadly rather tedious), trading (legal or otherwise) is viable once you upgrade your cargo hold and find the best prices in the dynamic system, and there are plenty of things to run into out in the depths of space. Speaking of which, there's a real sense of "space" as you travel around, not enough to be tedious as you travel between planets, but enough to make it feel like a journey, watching nebulae whip by, unknown flotillas caught on the edge of your scanner, and the occasional tempting beacon to check out. The story is also a cut above the usual generic stuff, decent writing helped by the setting, and some nice voice work, plus the story missions are some of the best time to be had.\n\nI can possibly seeing it getting a bit repetitive after a while, but tell me a game that isn't. For 20 bucks you should get several days of enjoyment from this. It really depends on how much you enjoy the core gameplay loop, but for me this is the best space game released in 2015 by miles, because the developers clearly want you to have a blast. Constant updates and bug fixes show that they're committed to their customers, a great example of a two-man team showing the big boys how it's done.","October 24, 2015","true","21.9"," 142 of 151 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","142","151","6","0"

Great graphics, great soundtrack, great atmosphere. Different weapon types and visceral combat. No-one would blame you if you thought that this was the next Privateer or Freelancer.\n\nBut delve into it a bit deeper and you begin to see the hollowness under its pretty exterior. Combat that was fun at the start becomes very repetitive the 20th time you beat the exact same group of pirates using the exact same tactics. There's not much to do in combat either, all of your weapons work on some form of autoaim so you don't even have the challenge of leading your target properly in order to hit them.\n\nThe worst part of the combat is how its more attritional than based on maneuver. You'd think that because a lot of the ships' firepower is in their broadsides you can maneuver to 'cross their T' so you can take down targets much larger than you are, but all ships have omnidirectional turrets that make this very hard to do. Instead of fighters trying to get on each other's tail or ships trying to cross each others' T, Rebel Galaxy's ships are more like 2 RTS units shooting at each other: DPS and shielding are king and the effect of maneuver is minimal.\n\nThis is made even worse by the way the game tiers its weapons and defenses. The tiers are set up in this game in such a way that its possible to get into a situation where you fight a ship you can never beat (i.e. their shields regenerate faster than you can ever damage them), and your only recourse is to grind money so you can buy the next higher tier of weaponry. It makes the game into one big grind. And the grind takes a LONG time. In the later stages of the game it would take upwards of 20 missions to fully upgrade your ship's weapons, shields and components to the next tier.\n\nThe grind also puts the blandness of the procedurally generated universe into stark relief. Once you've seen all the types of stations in the first system, you've seen all the stations in the rest of the game. The only thing that differentiates one station from another is what tier of weapons they sell. There are no special 'capital planets' or 'story planets' like there were in Privateer or Freelancer. There's no sense of exploration as a station of one type in a system is virtually identical to a station of the same type in another system. You won't get the sense of discovery that you get when you first land in the Oxford system in the original Privateer, or when you land on a capital planet in Freelancer.\n\nThe main storyline also falters at the very end. Barring the grind, the main quests are interesting enough to get you to the finale. The ending though, is bullpoo. Let's just say that someone leaves for no damn good reason, and you're dumped into the sandbox with very little fanfare. And by the time you finish it, you'd be so tired of the grind that the sandbox would no longer have any appeal.\n\nIf you're looking for a Privateer or Freelancer-type game try Starpoint Gemini 2 instead. It's a lot less polished but it has a big enough universe to make discovery interesting, has a tolerable grind and more interesting combat. Or dust off the old joystick and play Independence War 2.","October 24, 2015","false","16.9"," 479 of 611 people (78%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","78","479","611","9","16"

In essence for me it's Freelancer reborn, except with capital ships.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic, although I would strongly recommend a controller. Both the 360 one, and the Steam Controller work brilliantly with the game.\n\nOne thing that separates the game from freelancer is the capital ships, and that you use Broadsides for your primary weapons. As such you need to get your sides facing the enemies.\nFear not though, it's still super intense, and you have plenty of other weaponry. Ranging from Secondary fire ones such as EMP Waves, Flak cannons and plenty of turrets.\nTurrets are mostly A.I controlled, although you can set priorities for each and every one of them. Such as Fire at Any Craft, Target, Locked Targets only, or even Fighters only.\n\nThis means that you can focus all fire on a single enemy, or you can handle the capital ships while your turrets deal with the swarms of enemy fighter and gunships.\n\nIt's rather odd at first, but after a while it becomes extremely satisfying. To the point of almost feeling like you're in Battlestar Galactica fending off literal swarms of enemies.\n\nSadly, you're unable to be a carrier and have your own fighters, although it's not too much of an issue.\n\nThe story is very interesting, and it certainly is engaging. Although some story missions have very high requirements and as such you Have to go do other missions to get a better ship and equipment.\n\nThis is no issue at all, and extremely fun. You can do a variety of missions, or you can just do pirate bounty hunting. Doing missions however increases or decreases your reputation with various factions. This in turn unlocking newer ship hulls, and equipment.\n\nYou're also able to join some guilds, such as the Mercenaries or Merchants which give extra missions and other unique ship hulls.\n\nI would strongly encourage you to find one you like.\n\nTrading is not the most complex of systems, but very manageable, and slightly fun. I've never been much of a trader but each system and station has various prices and requirements. An impoverished station will pay a lot more for food and water than a well set up military one. While some might accept some contraband pirate items; ranging from Narco Cola, to Living Organs.\n\nShips can also be scanned so be careful carrying contraband, the Militia will scan you and will hail you to explain yourself. If you simply ignore their Hails they will go hostile and attack you. If you want to play with those items, make sure to get a Smuggler's Cargohold; They can't be scanned ;)\n\nGraphics and performance wise the game does extremely well. It's no Star Citizen, but it looks great and runs even better. Now I might have an overkill machine with Two GTX 980Ti's, but playing at 4K with DSR I was topping out at 144FPS which is my monitor's cap, and at worst getting 80fps.\nThe only slight complaint I have is little lag spikes when phasing in and out of a station. Although this is most likely an engine issue that'll soon be fixed for textures loading in and out.\n\nAs for graphical options the game as plenty and they're all adjusted with through the game launcher. It also has 3 graphics APIs to choose from. DirectX 9, DirectX 11 and even OpenGL if you fancy using that.\n\nI unfortunately only have experience running the game in DX11, but it's done exceptionally well.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention is the brilliant soundtrack. It's very similar to Borderlands, and I feel it suits the game very well. Personally it gives me a Borderlands and Cowboy Bebop feel to the game and I really enjoy having it on.\n\nIn the game launcher however you can also create some custom music options so you can expand it all  if you so desire.\n\nAll in all, I simply love the game. I've 40 hours into it, and I've still not finished the main story because I've been having so much fun with everything else. If you enjoyed Freelancer, I would really recommend the game; and for others it's simply a great mini sandbox open Space Action Sim with capital ships.\n\nPC Gameplay 60 FPS\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w6YOkw0TXo","October 20, 2015","true","42.0"," 168 of 202 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","168","202","4","4"

You're piloting a capital ship, not a little fighter, which gives it a different feel.  The combat is extremely satisfying, there are a lot of choices in how you equip your ship, and the universe feels like there are really things going on in it besides what you're doing.\n\nIf you liked Pirates: instabuy, the game systems are similar.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ziddersroofurry/recommended/290300/","ziddersroofurry","Zidders Roofurry -{EAC}-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ziddersroofurry/","174 products in account","So here it is-my Rebel Galaxy review. First off some disclosure-I've been following these devs since I started hanging out on the Runic Games forum back in 2009 and have gotten to know them well enough to be on friendly terms. I helped out with the Torchlight II beta and it's one of the reasons I was given preview keys back in May and early October.\n\nAll that said I'll do my best to be impartial here.  I'm going to give you my impression of my overall experience. You're mileage may vary. My Tl'dr opinion? I personally love it and am 100 hours in but then this is so many things about space games I love rolled into one. It means I tend to be very forgiving of the flaws my review will be mentioning. OK all that said:\n\nThe Setting.\n\nThe game goes for a Firefly/Wing Commander:Privateer/Freelancer vibe and does a pretty good job of nailing it down. The solar systems in this game are on the wrong side of the galactic tracks and haven't had a bath in aeons. They're rude, crude and filled with rocks and junk. I've seen it described as 'bikers in space' and it's a fitting description. Rebel Galaxy features an interesting cast of curious characters which is why it's one of the games unfortunate downsides that you never really get to know any of them very well. It's loaded with the kind of wink/nudge humor you'd find in TV series like Farscape or some of the more humorous episodes of Stargate-for example one of the commodities you can trade is called 'Narco-cola' and it is just that. Powerful narcotics in the form of carbonated beverage. If you're a fan of stuff like Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy you'll appreciate the humor.\n\nThe Story:\nLength 30-40 hours (20 if you're an old hand at these kind of games).\n\nIt ain't deep but it gets the job done. Like I wrote above the characters all have interesting personalities but those personalities are shallow and you won't interact with any of them very much. It's a shame because they are just interesting enough where I wanted to get to know them more only by the time I got past the 'Hello, nice to meet you, may I help you kill this troup of troublemakers?' bits their role in the story was done.\n\nThis becomes even more disappointing by the end of the story. It's a great lead up but the end is a bit of a disappointment. I'll give DDGames credit-despite my not liking how it ended I still want to go through it again. There's one character in particular I really like and I can't help but hope taking a different faction path will open up at least a few new bits of dialogue.\n\nThe Sound:\nThe soundtrack is down & dirty country/rebel/blues rock. If you're into down and dirty southern-fried blues this will be right up your alley. It helps add a lot to the atmosphere and makes you feel like every space station bar serves oil pan shots and barbed wire biscuits. The sound effects are another matter entirely-voiceovers can get a bit repetitive to the point of tediousness at times. Some of the audio isn't mixed well-radio chatter clips/distorts a lot and I don't recommend you use expensive speakers or a subwoofer if you plan on blasting this. In fact don't. I'm hoping some of the audio issues get fixed soon.\n\nVoice acting is pretty stellar for an indie game. This is one of the things that lends a lot of personality to the characters. From what I understand a lot of it was done by the devs themselves (with the help of the always amazing Lani Minella). I dare say it's better than in most Bethesda games I've played. Even though Travis does numerous voices they sound different enough where it's not that much of a drawback.\n\nShips:\nThere are 21 playable ships you're able to buy throughout the game. Some of these require money and some require you to build a positive reputation with various factions (pirates, merchants guild etc). Each ship is upgradable with a wide variety of weapons and components. Lasers, missiles, shields, hulls-you can customize your ship to beef them up and match them to your playing style. This wide variety and manner of aquiring and upgrading ships means there's a lot of replay to be squeezed out of the game.\n\nI did find it unfortunate that you're not able to access all ships. Certain ships belonging to certain races seem to be inaccessible which is a real downer in a game that revolves around the very notion of collecting every ship you happen to come across.\n\nCombat:\nCombat takes place on a 2-D plane. That means it's more like naval combat in games like Assassin's Creed:Black Flag or Sid Meiers Pirates (the 2004 edition) or the auto combat in Mad Max. Thanks to the variety of components and weapons in game no matter what your playstyle is you can adapt your craft to it. Upgrading certain components helps with your survivability. You can also hire a merc to accompany you which is always a smart move as some of them are extremely lethal. The one down side of using a merc is that you can't upgrade their weapons or ships.\n\nIt would have been cool to see something closer to the pets in Torchlight or Companions in Diablo III-especially considering all the weaponry that drops from capital ships. Being able to give my mercs better gear early on would have helped a lot as the best mercs aren't available until late in the game.\n\nThe main downside to combat is that difficulty seems to be very imbalanced at the moment. It's a lot of fun don't get me wrong but some missions say they're difficult when they're not and vice versa. It's also pretty spinny. Enemies run but they never run -that- fast or far which  means there will be times when you spend  battles going in circles. That said the effects are glorious and when combat is good it's really, really good.\n\nThe other stuff:\nMining-It's a pretty zen-like experience. Cruise up to some rocks, scan them then go up to the ones full of ore. You can buy a fault tracker early on that paints red circles on asteroids that have more than one piece of ore in them. Blow it up that way and you get multiple ores. It's a pretty relaxing experience unfortunately unless you're very good at the market stuff, explore a LOT and very patient you won't be making a ton of credits mining.\n\nCommodities: Stations sell commodities. Buy low/sell high type stuff. Different stations have different events that effect the rest of that systmes econmies. You can also read the in station news boards or ask the bartenders/merchants for info.\n\nHackable transponders that give tasty info, random cargo containers that contain nice loot (sort of like the outer space version of barrells in an rpg) and rescue missions aplenty are some of the other bits of content you'll find in this game.\n\nSUMMARY:\nRebel Galaxy is a fun, arcadey naval-game-in-space that provides some of the trappings of a space-sim while ditching most of the complexity and time-investment required of more traditional space sims like EVE Online or Elite:Dangerous. It's great for drop in and play for a half hour or so sessions. If you're the kind of person who spends hours playing space games just for the sake of the ambience and love blowing stuff up with enough lights to build a discotechque this will scratch that itch for at least a little while. Personally I'm 100 hours in and haven't gotten bored yet.\n\nThose looking for a deeply engaging story you're not going to find one but the characters have tons of personality and give the setting a very lived in feel-just be ready for the ending to be a bit of a let down. Those into trading should be happy though the game feels like it needs a bit of tweaking since not all professions feel viable. The accent is on combat so expect to blow up a lot of ships if you're looking to be one of the galaxy's richest space truckers.\n\nDespite its flaws this is an impressive first game from Double Damage Games. The developers put a lot of heart into this and it shows. This would have been a solid deal even at $30 but at $20 it's way more than worth it.","October 25, 2015","true","132.7"," 82 of 89 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","82","89","3","4"

Right now. What are you waiting for? Stop reading these words and go buy it.\n\nYou're still reading? Fine I'll put more words here that might mean things about stuff. Seriously, though, this game overdelivers its $20 at release date price (or whatever you can get it for on sale). There are plenty of other reviews speaking to what's great about this game, so I won't beat a dead horse. However, I would like to speak to some of the negative comments that I've seen.\n\n"Missions are repetitive." - this is true, but that hasn't reduced my enjoyment of gameplay. Sure the missions are repetitive, but each encounter does have variations within it. There are at least 3 major variations with each mission: mission type, types of friendlies, types of enemies.\nThere are escort missions (follow a friendly around at warp speed and defend them from attacking hostiles that pull you out of warm), defend missions (move into an engagement and prevent friendlies from being destroyed), destroy missions (fly in guns blazing until everything is on fire, including you), snatch and run / fight missions (fly into an area teeming with hostiles, grab some cargo, and gtfo), delivery missions (get some cargo and deliver it to another station, while being pulled out of warp multiple times from hostiles trying to take your cargo). There are also other types that I haven't done yet (pirate missions).\nThe other aspect that changes missions are types of friendlies/enemies. Sometimes you're fighting multiple cruisers with minor fighter support, sometimes you're fighting a dreadnaught with tons of fighter support, sometimes you're fighting waves upon waves of fighters - and yes these do require different engagement tactics. Good luck charging into waves of mine layer / bomber fighters with a cruiser and winning.\nI also feel like I need to point out that repetitive side missions aren't a new thing. How many times have you collected herbs as a side quest in some other RPG?\n\n"2D space combat" - When I read this before buying it, I wasn't sure how I would feel about it. After playing the game - I just don't care that it's not 3D. I don't feel like it being 3D would make it any more fun, especially with the "broadside" style gameplay (which I do enjoy). The 2D movement environment plus broadside style combat provides enough complexity without making it over-complex. You can still use tactics to use a smaller vessel to take down a larger one. I've used my quick cruiser to take down multiple dreadnaughts by getting behind them so that the only damage I'm taking is from their rear turrets and the occasional heat seeking missile, and they can't turn fast enough to broadside me. Plus with a fast vessel you have enough maneuverability to be able to zig-zag between your broadsides (shields don't depreciate as a whole - but each side is separate, for a total of 4 shields) to be able to keep your shields up, all while staying out of the main line of fire. Or you could just buy a huge ship, get ramming deflectors, AND RAMMING SPEED EVERYTHING TO DEATH. Twice.\n\n"Main Storyline is [insert words]" I'm not sure why people are complaining about the main storyline. At the time of writing this I've had 26 hours in the game and still haven't finished it. Sure it's nothing especially fancy... but it is engaging, and seriously it's a $20 game. I'm not sure what you expect. I've played plenty of single player RPG-style games (ones that ONLY have a main storyline) that I've cleared in under 30 hours, and those were $50-60 at release.\n\n"Soundtrack something or other" I also really enjoyed the soundtrack with it's Firefly vibe, however I would have to agree that it starts getting repetitive. I also have an easy solution. Turn off the music. Play your own if you really want music. Again, for a $20 game the soundtrack exceeds what I would expect.\n\nFinal thoughts - the depth and enjoyability of the game overdelivers as a $20 price tag, making it a worthwhile purchase.  I would also like to see (and gladly pay for) some DLC/expansions to further increase the depth of the game (greater variety of missions, more ships, more weapons, more factions, expand main storyline, more musc, online co-op play)\n\nEnd transmission?","October 24, 2015","true","46.5"," 71 of 75 people (95%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","95","71","75","15","0"

This game is really good and deserves a sequel.  Definitely has a Firefly universe feel to it which says a lot really.  Definitely worth 20 bucks.\n\nPros - Well designed, awesome soundtrack, great voiceovers.\n\nCons - A liitle too easy.  I used a merc frigate throughout the whole game, took on whole fleets including super dreadnoughts and the enemy rarely got through my shields.  Using basic common sense is more powerful than a dreadnought it seems.  The ending of the game, while realistic, felt a bit underwhelming to be honest.  The game goes to sandbox only then, but whats the point really..\n\nConclusion: A really wonderful gem here on Steam.  Without a doubt one of the best space games ever made.  These guys made a solid game and it was worth my 20 bucks easy.  Just hate its over.  Now I hope they make a sequel or another game of this quality.

When I played Freelancer, I had a "was that it?" feeling.  Contrarily, Rebel Galaxy gives off a "not JUST a space flight adventure simulator" sort of vibe.\n\nYay:\n- Ignore the story, earn money, buy really big ships.\n- Ability to join multiple guilds without needing to quit your current one\n- Broadside combat in a space sim is surprisingly fun.\n- Very responsive devs, check the bug reports part of the forum\n- Prices of commodities go up and down in response to world events and planetary type\n- Wide variety of missions.  Escort, Pickup, Delivery, Blockade Running, Head hunting...\n- No speed lanes, you want to get somewhere fast just point your nose and punch the warp.\n- Dynamic system.  In Wing Commander: Privateer, you could watch the news and respond accordingly to major events.  Is there a famine?  Bring food.  War?  Bring weapons.  Market glut, buy low.  This system is rarely found in these space trading games.  I don't think Freelancer had it.\n- Good voice acting\n- Intuitive game design\n- Aliens!\n- Varied Nebulas.  Including the classic ones like lightning nebulas that can shatter your shields in a single flash and dark nebulas where danger and mystery lurk within.\n- Scanner.  A nifty halo emits from your ship and lets you know of nearby enemies, allies, and items.\n\nNay:\n- Broadside combat is rather easy.  Just manuever until your side is exposed, use precise targetting, and press a button.  The lead is automatically calculated for you.  The only thing you need to decide is how much time to charge the shot.\n- Fighters are so annoying since they can go to the 3rd dimension.  Plus the strike craft defense options are a bit lacking due to their extremely limited range.  You're left with relying on general-purpose turrets to pick off the pesky gnats one at a time.\n- No speed lanes.  Most of the time, I neglect to plot a proper course before warping so I end up going through like 3 asteroid fields, 2 debris fields, and 1 planet.  That's like hitting 6 red lights when you're trying to get somewhere.\n\nMeh:\n- No idle radio chatter\n- From what I've played so far, you pass lots of planets but there is no planetary landing.  You always stop at a station in orbit.  I'm guessing the idea is that space ships should stay in space where they're designed to work.\n","October 22, 2015","true","39.5"," 64 of 68 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","64","68","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/megakoresh/recommended/290300/","megakoresh","Megakoresh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/megakoresh/","152 products in account","Rebel Galaxy is a cautios recommendation. For 20€ it's a good game. It has some major flaws, but I would still call it a good game at the end of the day. I'll try this review in a different format, because this is a game that could have been a hidden gem of the year if developers had a little different focus. So:\nWhat this game should have had First and absolutely foremost: Context. That was SUCH a huge miss. The game provides no context for anything outside of the main quest.\nMissions and systems have zero context. They are condensed to a marker on the map. No characters to talk to, no multiple ways to complete missions, no multi-staged missions, no consequences. Even faction missions have absolutely no context.\nEvery trader is one of two possible models, they all have exactly the same lines, regardless of where and how you meet them.\nAll mercenaries are 5 characters that inexplicably appear in every system on random stations and can't be interacted with beyond "Hey, what ship you fly?", "What's your skills?" and "You are hired".\nReally really huge miss, because the mechanics of this game are very simplistic and can not justify the complete absence of context. Fast travel. 90% of the gameplay time is wasted on the annoying warp mechanic.\nThere's no fast travel and you have to go between stations very often. During warp you have to manually aim your ship and it won't exit out of warp unless you aim it dead on point, so you can't just alt-tab and check email. You have to stare at the screen.\nYou get pulled out of warp on every tiny object to the side of your path. And there are a LOT of meaningless tiny objects in this game.\nYou can not engage warp again until after you are cleared from any mass, and it takes a while to accelerate enough to start warping again so travelling turns into an incredibly boring and frustrating experience that you have to endure a lot.\nWhat this game should have ditched to get the aboveScale. The game is absolutely unnecessarily large.\nYou have something like 12 systems (don't remember exact number), each has about as many space stations. To travel through the whole map and visit every station once would require a full day of gameplay. And EACH station has like 6 contract missions, all of which are done with one of 3 main templates (fetch quest, elimination and escort), and might as well be MMORPG repeating quests.\nAll of the stations are exactly the same. They vary only in what merc sits inside and the prices they offer on goods. The bartenders have the same dialogue, there are no interesting quests to pick up, no characters to talk to. Hell - even weapons and ships they offer are the same. Only faction stations offer different equipment.\nAll in all it's a typical quantity over quality issue. The game could have been 10 times smaller (not exaggerating, I actually think that would be the proper reduction), but if it had actually interesting quests with dialogue, context and variety to offer it would have been much better for it.Economy. It's just uninteresting and not worth your time.\nThe entire economy in the game could be thrown out and it wouldn't be missed. It's your basic buy low sell high economy, except fetching goods in this game, as I've explained, is tiresome and frustrating, and there's no market manipulation you can perform.\nThe money you get out of it is rather small, overall I just don't think there's any reason to try and make money with it.\nIt's not an MMO. There's no infinite high end equipment and clans and raids you can spend that dosh on. You can buy one of the overpriced heavy dreadnaughts, but... why? They aren't fun to use and what would you use it for anyway? Fetching more goods? It's just pointless and wasted resources IMO.\nEquipment could have been made into upgradable loot drops - you can't buy gear, but you can upgrade it with dosh and missions. That would have made the game far more engaging too, bring some variety in. As it stands, once I bought a full combo of guns, I just used the same set of equipment throughout the entire game, upgrading it.\nSo as you can see there are some big issues. So what's good?\nWhat's good?Combat. It's very similar to Assassin's Creed Black Flag naval combat, just in Space. It's very cinematic, albiet not exactly difficult. It's by no means a sim, it's absolutely unrealistic and very arcady, but that doesn't really matter. It's fun. That's the main thing.\nCombat's difficulty comes from how the game is balanced - it is very binary. You are either not having any problems whatsoever, or you are dead. Ship's HP is very small. Your shields and armour are what protect you.\nThe main skill in this game is to turn your ship all the time to let the shields on another side regenerate. You must never let enemies surround you and you must maneuvre such that you take as little continuous fire as possible, while spreading the damage over all your shields.\nThis is also a reason why you never want to fly a dreadnaught. Small ship that you can turn to spread damage across all your 4 shields and platings is more survivable than large ship which is gonna take all the damage to one side. Sountrack - amazing rock and country music, with cinematic arcade combat in a spectacle of lazers and explosions. What more could you ask for?\nGraphics - the game looks good obviously.\nPolish - the game runs well and never crashed or bugged out on me.\nAliens - they look and sound cool. I think the alien languages aren't necessary, but the looks and voice modifiers are cool.\nProgression - there's a variety of cool ships on display and all except dreadnaughts are quite fun to use. Also there is a large variety of guns you can install, each with a specific strength and weakness. You can take control of any gun directly, through in my experience turrets are always better controlled by the AI. Usually you are better off controlling broadsides and maneuvering the ship for the most advantageous angle.\nAtmosphere. The game's light-hearted atmosphere with a few funny lines of text here and there blend well with combat and music.\nSo in the end I think the game is quite good for what it is. I just think it would have been a hell of a lot better had the developers more clearly understood it's strengths and weaknesses. A cautious recommendation, but a recommendation nonetheless.","December 12, 2015","true","23.0"," 79 of 93 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","79","93","2","0"

PLAY the damn game instead of just trying to get it over with.\n\nThe game's unique take on broad-side combat, old-school battleship-style A la WWII, makes for a refreshing space experience that made me wonder why other space combat games did not adopt a similar format long ago.\n\nThis is NOT an X3-equivalent space empire building sim, nor is it a hardcore rogue-like. It's simple a great single-player adventure with great combat mechanics and above-average story progression with TONS of polish and character. This is better than most AAA titles today.\n\nFor the money, it's a steal at full price.

Thankfully the fighting is pretty fun. Instead of playing as a fighter or small freighter/gunship like many of these types of open-ended/sandbox space games, you start out in a Corvette and eventually work your way up to larger ships, I believe there is roughly 20 playable ships in all. As has been mentioned, the combat plays something like Assassin's Creed Black Flag ship battles, maneuvering on a 2D plane, with a heavy emphasis on broadsides and positioning. Your ship is outfitted with a main battery of broadside cannons as well as some turrets and secondary weapons (like missile launchers). You can customize the weapons of your ship with stuff like long/short range guns, beam lasers, missile turrets, anti-fighter/missile flak guns, etc etc.\n\nThe game is surprisingly colorful and ships explode into big bright fireballs when they die. Its fun. The music, as I've mentioned is cheesey western butt-rock and, IMO, quite nice. However if its not your thing, or if you just get bored of it, the game has an option to put your own music into the game (alongside or replacing the soundtrack). I haven't progressed too far into the main plot, but this doesn't seem like the kind of game most would play for a gripping plot, as its pretty basic so far. Basically your aunt, an (in)famous smuggler and overall space Rogue, sends you a package containing a weird alien artifact and the access codes to one of her old ships and tells you to meet up with her and you go off to get into cool space battles and track her down.\n\nThe game is only $20 and so far it seems like a lot of fun for that price.","October 21, 2015","true","23.5"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","44","48","0","0"

I'll admit, I went into this game without much knowledge of it at all... and after the time I've spent with it, I can only say... Rebel Galaxy is totally badass!\nHowever, allow me to explain the basics of the game. Simply, you're a Space Cowboy, living on the edge of the law and banditry. You explore the vastness of space, blasting away pirates or helping them incinerate innocent traders while completing missions and getting rich. You get your own equipment customizable spaceship where you can fire broadsides, flak, missiles and all sorts of vaporizing goodness. There are even quite a few ships that you can purchase should you gain enough money. The concept is simple, the gameplay is addicting.\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfZxrhvyJl8\nThe game also has an epic sound track of catchy guitar twangs as you blow Space Pirates into nonexistence. The voice acting is also very solid. As if that wasn't good enough, the gameplay is fluid and the controls make sense. While the control isn't as indepth as Space flight sims like Elite: Dangerous, it's more than enough to keep players interested while also keeping the gameplay fast-paced.\nAll in all, I definitely recommended this game!","October 20, 2015","true","3.8"," 52 of 62 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","52","62","6","2"

Then I watched a tutorial on suggestions to get started, what to spend your money on, and that I should rent a mercenary. Then I absolutely started trashing other ships and it was hella fun. The soundtrack is fantastic, the combat is really satisfying, and I love that you can customize your weapon loadouts and ships, depending on what you want to do.\n\nI thought the galaxy was ENORMOUS- zooming out to the map and back into your ship a-la Eve Online gives you a really good perspective of how tiny you are compared to everything else. Then I realized there are like 15 other galaxies and I haven't even gone to the second one yet.\n\nI like the characters so far, particularly aunt Juno. I like that you can work for other factions, and end up being an as$hole pirate, an as$hole military agent, an as$hole smuggler, or an as$hole nice guy.\n\nIt's very quest based, so if that's not for you, then you may not like it, but I dig doing quests/bounties and getting money and upgrading my weapons and ship, I find it satisfying.\n\nReally enjoying this game, I feel like the marketing fell through and it hasn't gotten as much attention as it should have.","April 11","true","40.7"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","36","37","2","0"

Your goals are simple in the black, live, make money, and take care of anyone who tries to stop you from doing the other two. To help you is your trusty vessel of death and destruction, which can be armed to the teeth with guns, missiles, hull upgrades, shields, and gods know what. Along the way you will meet some interesting folk whom may or may not have your best interest at heart. While the main campaign does an okay job of expanding the universe. The meat of the game lies in combat, random events, and upgrading your vessel. The game itself is gorgeous, you can almost feel the sizzling heat of your cannons firing. The explosions of missiles rocking across your ship, and satisfaction of watching your enemies explode in a fiery death. All the ships look unique, the weapons have the proper amount of oomph behind them, and the soundtrack is a homage to Firefly. On top of all that sweetness, the game is really easy to get into and start playing. The game really reminds of AC: Black Flags naval combat, just this is in space. Same level of simplicity with more customization in weapons. Now Rebel Galaxy does have its occasional black holes. There are times where repetitive missions come into play and are required for equipment advancement. Lack of cosmetic customization feels like a miss in an outstandingly done game. The games story itself does feel like it could be a bit more exciting as well. Occasionally during combat it does feel odd you can't move up or down in space. Despite these issues, the game is still extremely well made. No bugs ever interrupted my gameplay. As far as replay goes, there are multiple factions to pursue an allegiance with and multiple play styles you can choose from. Be a bounty hunter, cartel member, or trader, the choice is up to you what role you will play in Rebel Galaxy.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/sP2LrtDwiU8\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","November 8, 2015","true","13.5"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","41","46","0","0"

It is probably not as large as other space-sims, however.\n+ There's lots of things to do, which checks off most of the traditional space-sim tropes: Mining, Trading, Bounty Hunting to name a few as well as a good variety of side missions which cover your basic 'go to point A and blow stuff up' runs to things like 'Go to station B and run/break a blockade to deliver goods'. I've played for 30+ hours in a game which cost me a third of the amount a AAA game does.\n+ The games events and economy, while basic, are a living thing. They'll play out whether you're there or not. If a station is hit by a crime wave, it will remain until someone goes and cleans it up, whether it's you or the AI militia. Trade convoys cross the system and deliver goods, which effects the prices you buy and sell for. If pirates (or you!) happen to cross paths with them on their trip the items will never get there, which may cause their stock to drop and their sell prices to rise.\n+ The soundtrack is awesome and makes the game very reminiscent of Firefly. It fits the game incredibly well and makes battles against enemy cap-ships all the sweeter\n+ Broadside combat is excellent, and remarkably fun. No longer do you just point at an enemy and click - your shields and armor are seperated in to quadrants and you constantly have to think about the best maneuvers to maximise damage while protecting your vulnerable sides. You can even direct-control the turrets on your ship, as well as deploying flak, EMP's, Mines or missiles.\n+ Good variety of ships and weapons. Yeah, they're all cap-ships but that's the name of the game. You're not just some no-name rookie making your name running your fighter from a carrier. You captain corvettes, frigates, destroyers, cruisers and even dreadnaughts fitted out with machine guns, missile launchers, pulse lasers, beam lasers, flak cannons and your beastly broadside weapons.\n+ In almost every regard the game is top-notch: the aesthetics are excellent, the controls are excellent, the sound design is immersive, the world is immense and the gameplay is, most importantly, fun.\n+ The best custom soundtrack integration I've seen in a recent game, you get to pick which tracks play in combat, stations, while cruising... hell - there's even an option to mix your tracks with the original soundtrack.\n+ Piracy pays in this game - one of my favourite pass-times in this game is responding to merchant distress calls with a few tons of high-price cargo in my posession. Save the merchants, sell the cargo to them at a premium and then threaten them to hand back what I just sold them for free. It's a brilliant way of making some extra cash.\n+ 1:1 sell ratio on your equipment and ships, so there's never any risk of being stuck with expensive gear you decide you don't like.\n\nCons:\n- Missions can become a little repetative after a while, although if you begin to feel like this you'll realise it's because you've played the game for a decent stretch of time\n- Travelling across a system can take a little too long sometimes, even with engine upgrades I'm never feeling like I'm moving fast enough while in warp\n- Difficulty can spike without warning, usually when you equip your first bit of next-tier tech: there's a reason even the bartenders tell you to upgrade shields and armor before weapons.\n- Voice acting is 'just' OK. The npc voice pool is shallow and some of the emotional delivery is pretty bland.\n- The dialogue options really don't serve a purpose. it boils down to 'Option one to be a coward and drop your cargo', 'Option two to politely refuse and lose a faction point', 'Option three to be a badass renegade, 'Option 4 to be a badass renegade and ♥♥♥♥ off this faction' all of which provoke the most pitiful and monotonous responses. If you want to be a badass renegade, be prepared to hear 'I hope you like the cold, Cutter' without an ounce of anger or fear behind it 9/10 times.\n- This game could have really benefited from a sort of 'infamy system', which, depending on your net-worth, loadout, faction standing or how much ♥♥♥ you tend to kick provided a little more of an emotional response from your attackers. No matter what you do, say or how many of those pirate jack-offs you just disintegrated, they will always give you the same responses - 'drop your cargo or die', 'no? ok, now you will die'. They even say it if you've literally just wiped out all their health and their ship is about to explode.\n\n- While the soundtrack is awesome, it's short and the tracks cycle every time the situation changes - it's rare you'll hear one all the way through. I don't think there's more than 10 tracks in total and some of those are instrumental versions of the others. It begins to grate a little around the 9 hour mark - thank god for custom soundtracks. The 'Sons of the North' and 'These Savage Lands' Albums by The Black Spiders fit the game incredibly well IMO and have saved me from getting sick of the original soundtrack.\n- Once you finish the story, get yourself a dreadnaught and kit it out with 6th Tier tech there isn't really any motivation to continue. The story missions aren't particularly exciting enough to play again so your only goal after that really is to make money that you can't spend on anything. It's unlikely you'll feel motivated enough to commit to a second playthrough due to the 1:1 sell ratio on your equipment. If you have a Blackgate with Mark 6 Beam Turrets, Beam Broadsides and Defense tech then you can literally sell it 1:1, which lets you switch to any other ship you may have missed. The only way to screw yourself out of money late-game is either by trading like an idiot, fighting like an idiot or recruiting mercs who are idiots.\n\nUnsure:\n+/- Yes, it's been said countless times: there's no Y axis of movement. However with broadside combat I believe the game is better off for it. This game would be frustrating levels of fiddly control-wise trying to move up and down, while trying to maintain target lock with your broadsides/control lateral movement while aiming your turrets, while trying to line up your secondaries and maneuvre your ship to keep your target on your strongest side.\n\nSummary:\nThere's a lot more they could have done with the "Negotiate" part of the game (they put that part of the tagline in quotations? has no-one else mentioned that?), it can get a little bit same-y and repetative after long stretches and it could do with more ship and loadout options but in the end the game is pure space-cowbow fun. My interest only began to waver at the end when I suddenly realised I had enough money to cover buying everything in the game and completing station missions, trading, mining or pirating were not only no-longer a challenge in my mile-long Dreadnaught, but also no longer pushing me towards any kind of goal. This is, however, over 30 hours in while most AAA titles struggle to hold my interest for more than 8 hours.\n\nIf you love Firefly and the space-sim genre but are put off by the overly-complex nature of some of them then give this a shot, it's the one you've been waiting for. Even if games like X and ED are your bread and butter, buy this as a sort 'tune out and have mindless fun' kind of game to sink a few hours in to. Despite it's lackluster story and character performances as well as a few missed opportunities in gameplay design, primarily it's a game where you're expected to have fun blowing ♥♥♥♥ up and besides Jahovas Witnesses, who doesn't like that?","April 21","true","34.9"," 29 of 29 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","29","29","0","0"

It's hard to believe that Double Damage managed to achieve what no else (in my experience) has been able to for over 20 years. Make a proper sequel to Wing Commander: Privateer.\n\nJust like the aforementioned Privateer, this game does have a main story, but it doesn't constantly nag at you to follow it. Not that you should ignore the main story mind you; while it's probably not going to win any kind of literary award, it is interesting and decent enough to follow, and I'll leave it at that.\n\nThe free roam in this game is an absolute joy. Total freedom. You have an entire sector of star systems to explore, and there's plenty of stuff to seek out. One warning though, while the game is obviously 3D, it is played on a 2D plane. Your ship can't go up or down, only left and right. But honestly, this game is more about fun than realism so I didn't find that much of an issue. You can fly around and collect bounties, mine asteroids, or take missions at any kiosk at any star-base. There are many different factions, and it's not possible to be friends with them all, so choose your missions and targets carefully.\n\nThe are lots of ships of different classes and sizes ranging from sleek corvettes to massive dreadnoughts. Plenty of weapons and systems to customize them to your liking too, The combat is explosive and exhilarating and often quite challenging if you get yourself into a pickle. My suggestion in those situations is to turn tail and run. No shame in retreating to lick your wounds. You can always come back and kick butt later.\n\nThe controls for this game definitely favour using a controller, as it was obviously designed for it's use. But I did play it with keyboard and mouse just to see how it was and they didn't do too bad a job. Still I recommend using a controller for this game as the combat is so much easier when using one in my honest opinion.\n\nWell that about sums it up. A great space combat simulator that's loads of fun to play. I strongly recommend Rebel Galaxy to any fan of the genre. I suppose I could write more, but I'm dying to get back to the game!","October 23, 2015","true","50.0"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","34","38","0","5"

However what killed it for me was the fact that you're in a big cruiser-type ship and you're stuck driving the thing around like a car on a flat surface.  No going up or down, just forward, back, turn left, turn right.  Meanwhile your enemies use full range of 3 dimensional space swarming all around you going up, down, left, right, forward, backward and essentially while you're looking around you can't go up to catch them.  I've had problems where the enemies went way too far up for me to actually do enough damage so I had to give up on the fight.

I'll summarize this as much as possible. If you want a very short review it is posted below.\n\nThe super short review :\n\n6 out of 10 ( Good for fist timers and the younger gaming crowd )\n\nAnyone expecting a game with depth in story line and ship functionality will be disappointed. The story line is predictable, the benefits are minimal, everyone wins gaming.\n\nWould I play this game again? No, probably not unless the developer added many more features and vastly improved the game AI.\n\nThe good:\n\nOverall a good looking game.\nRuns well, smooth.\nNo crashes.\nGreat sound track.\nMultiple paths to follow to end game ( Merchant, Pirate, Combat, Miner )\n\nThe Bad:\n\nYou "fly" on a single plane and cannot go up or down. While this is a space game I feel ike I am driving a tank or playing a FPS.\n\nThe weapons systems on your ship shoot through your ship most of the time.\n\nIt is a race to get Mark 5 / 6 items, you could do without but then you may have a harder times with the game.\n\nYou simply follow a simple path to the end game.\n\nThere is never a bounty placed on your head for the waves of AI you slaughter, your participation is not recognized in this game at all, this includes news stories.\n\nBetween Story line missions upgrading your ship is essential to completing the next mission you will not know this until you jump in and have a WTF moment.\n\nThere is no communication between stations for commodities ( minerals and goods ) thus what you buy for in one place might not be worth anything in another or one system over it is double in price.\nYou will never know unless you go there.\n\nShips and ship components are at 100% trade in and up value.  Thus switching out weapon systems is never a loss nor is it better from one place to another.\n\nThe AI never recognizes you. Sure while you can slaughter pirates whole sale in the hundreds, save countless traders or conduct crippling raids against the AI at no point does the dialog or your player presence change anything in the game. It is one dimensional.\n\nThere are always more AI, Going to a pirate faction station and eliminating everything in sight does nothing. The stations cannot be destroyed so eradicating a system of pirate activity is impossible.\n\nRandom encounters with AI fleets are pointless. Unless there is a bounty loot drops will not even pay for your spent missiles or damage you may take. Best to just avoid them.\n\nThe face you see of the AI are all the same. Pirates will taunt you and well this is the 100th time you killed that same pirate. Aliens all look the same also. Even some side characters look just like the random pirates as well as the Militia.\n\nThe lines for the AI or NPCs are the same and repetitive.\n\nTrell the AI the story line revolves around makes some minor upgrade to your ship. These are nothing amazing just some sensor and defensive bumps. The only time you interact with Trell is when she wants something ( typical woman ) For an AI with vast knowledge you would think she would tell you how to boost your weapon performance or make some great weapon system or a new type of ship.... nope.\n\nI came here to save Criminal Aunt Juno. However the dialogue with here does nothing to tell me why it would be worth it. No back story to tell me why I'd risk my ♥♥♥ to save this woman from the crap she got herself into.\n\nRandom AI gotcha moments, taking on a merchant mission with a low threat level was not really low at all. This was a game breaking moment for me because it made no sense what so ever. Enemy ships appear out of nowhere, surround your ship and disable it thus killing your mobility. This continually happens while fleets ( from fighters to dreadnaughts ) of AI pop up randomly. To sum it up the game mechanics cheat. You can attempt to run or if you have the right ship component ( so I am told ) nullify the effects of the disabling missiles.\n\nThe end game moments are really nothing special. I never got attached to Trell, she did nothing but get me into trouble, heck her upgrades were minimal at best. The was no big glorious end game movie clip or anything special for saving the galaxy from a deadly invasion. After all this Juno buys you a drink and that is the game.\n\nThe end game:\n\nI wanted to finish up achieving the end game in the most "advanced" combat ship with a decent fitting. There was a level of satisfaction at that point because annihilating even a super dreadnaught AI at the end was easy.  Completed with mark 5 / 6 equipped Black Gate Dreadnaught 54,000,000 credits, 1498 enemy ships destroyed. This tacked on another 5 hours of game play before I took on the end game mission. The threat level went from Very High to Low.\n\nWasted time, I spent a couple of hours sorting out the AI "cheat issue" with the Merchant mission before walking away from the missions. Ironically the combat missions were less dangerous. Exploration, mining and other activities burned up a few hours also.

I think you hit the absolutely sweet spot of fun / progression / story and artwork. I sometimes lost myself flying around, you made it really feel like I was out in outer-space, with the wide variety of planets / nebulas / junk fields / ice fields / asteroid fields, what have you. The sheer number of stations and objects you would run into while out in the cold really made it feel great.\n\nThe care & thought you put into the simplified UI design was nothing short of brilliant. Simple & elegant.  I thought you had thought of everything and once when flying, my UI popped up and said "It's been a while since you saved, you should dock at a station to save your game" or something - then I knew you HAD thought of everything.\n\nThe story was engaging, and the missions were enough of a large variety. Trade missions, assasination, protection, dead drops, the game really gives you a lot of options. So many cartels to see which one's you'll join / fight. The emergent game play - the distress signals (and ability to trade with the merchants was again a wise design choice as it reinforces saving their butts ;-), the un-identified signals, getting popped out in a junk or ice field, you made what should be a very empty space interesting while travelling around.\n\nFor two guys and a small army of outside contractors / agents that you employed, this game rocks.

The AI is bad, the world doesn't feel alive, NPC behavior is way off (a single bomber trying to rob a fully operational dreadnaught - that's par for the course here).\nBasically, it's a grindfest: you pop ships, buy bigger guns, pop bigger ships and so on until you get to top tier equipment. You can't turn the tide in galactic warfare. You can't make friends or even get in the news.\n\nSo, in short: if you want a 2D procedurally generated game, play Space Rangers.

Something happens your given a rust bucket from a family member and kicked out into space to do whatever you like. There is a story there if you'd like to explore it, but theres also a very large set of systems for you to get lost in. These systems start easy and quickly ramp up into fleets of doom that look like something out of babylon 5 or a borg invasion.\n\nGraphically the game is very pretty. Each weapon type has its own effects and its easy to tell what your oppents are using once you get familiarized with the types. You'll know when your enemy is shielding himself from your attacks and able to plan accordingly.\n\nCombat is a blast. Its a traditional "sailing" broadside system with a bit of a twist. There seems to be 2 types of ships. Broadside focused ships and turret focused ships. Turret ships have weaker broadsides so slightly less punch but they can hit in 360 degrees around their ship. Broadside ships usually have nasty blind spots at the front or back of their ships but if you end up on their sides your going to be sucking vacuum very quickly.\n\nGameplay is very open. You can do simply the main storyline and just enough side quests to up your combat effectiveness for the next mission or you can join one of the guilds. Partake in trading, Mercenary work, Pirating, and evening mining to pay the bills. All of these have their own supporting play styles, missions, and equipment.\n\nKeep in mind that there are also factions in the game, so if you choose to start popping merchant ships for their yummy goodies expect to have to deal with that militia destroyer next time you hit a station.\n\nAlternatively there are TONS of randomized seemingly procedurally generated encounters as you fly along towards your missions or stations. Merchentmen calling for help under attack by pirates, pirates trying to lure you in with distress calls, communication beacons you can hack to get some secret info for trading, mining spots, or loot caches, and of course the occasionally massive fleet battle from one of the many factions who's decided to take a crack at each other.\n\nAll of these features lead to making Rebel Galaxy on of my favorite games for the year and at a price point that is simply mind blowing.\n\nIf you'd like a bit more info and see how the game plays before hand check out my lets play below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM-GzIweKro","October 23, 2015","true","20.4"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","35","47","2","2"

The hugest problem though is the game's combat pretty much comes down to grinding for money to get gear so you don't instantly get blown out of the sky. There's very little strategy involved, you either have the right gear or you just get ♥♥♥♥ed. AI ships will just EMP you to oblivion so you can't run away (And you basicially have no defense against this whatsoever), they eat through shields and deflectors like crazy, and if your weapons aren't good enough its game over. Combat in the later game just feels like a war of attrition. I think what ties into this is they focused way too much breadth and instead of depth, the game's big but there's not much there.

Right off the bat this game is overrated by people new to the genre, who have had bad experiences with other games in the genre, are impressed by dev team responses in threads, are amazed that it's made by a two-man dev team, and love the soundtrack. New to the genre is self explanatory - it's a great and under used genre that has been a niche for far too long. Bad experiences..well a lot of the games of this ilk are either out dated like the greats Freelancer, DarkStar One, and the whole Privateer series, whilst the X series is notorious for being released in terrible condition and aren't patched to a high standard until usually the 3rd major patch. This doesnt make them any less worthy examples of the genre when they ARE finished but the initial buggyness and headaches tend to make people react so badly that the games are crucified before they even get to that stage. As for dev responses..I've not had one to my queries and even had one deleted from the threads altogether so no brownie points there fanboys. Whilst Double Damage are a two man team it is very rare for small or solo teams to do all the work themselves..they hire part-time fillers for artwork, coding..whatever is needed..I'm sure that's the case here - When was the last time you saw a credits list to ANY game that showed one or two names? The soundtrack IS great with its modern outlaw theme (very similar to some of the music in the Sons of Anarchy T.V. show) but great music alone does not make a game.\nAll this said, it's an accomplished entry FOR THOSE NEW TO THE GENRE who may be put off by something a lot more wide ranging and complex like Elite Dangerous; others may be put off by what can seem dumbed down and simplistic by comparison leaving a somewhat arcadey feel to combat. Regardless of how you feel in that respect it's a decent game that is certainly worth the asking price.","October 23, 2015","true","37.9"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","30","40","3","0"

Polish and charm is.\nVery enjoyable naval-style 2d combat. Easy to get into, few keybindings to remember, requires the correct amount of strategy (aka it never gets boring and it never makes your brain melt).\nOpportunistictrading and mining. No need for spreadsheets or noting something down. You'll instantly recognize red prices, stations with famine, mining rushes, market gluts, under siege etc and you'll know when to buy or sell. You'll stop to help traders being attacked by enemies and then sell them high some of your cargo.\nAddictive progression system. There's always a new ship, weapon or component to aim for and it will always be addictively close to your budget.\nShort, classic, cool story. It won't win an oscar, but the voice acting and general style is pleasing and keeps you mildly hooked. It never limits your sandbox experience though and you'll probably be alternating between sandbox and story.\nStyle. Lots of it. Very enjoyable and unique slide-guitar firefly-like rock soundtrack and you also get to use your own music for fighting, idle and in-station situations. Very colorful galaxy with cool gameplay-changing nebulas and asteroid fields.\nMake no mistake though, this game won't replace elite dangerous or star citizen in your library.

Rebel Galaxy is an action oriented spaceship game. Its NOT a simulator and its NOT a strategy game. The developers last title was Torchlight II and they managed to pack the ARPGs elements into this game as well. Theres loot theres upgrades, lots of ships and all this in a space setting which looks beautifull.\n\nSo....action oriented Space game.\n\n\nWho are you in this game?\n\nYou are a young starship captain and you dont start your carreer in a space fighter either. You start out with a frigatte. Sure its small and doesnt have a whole lot to it but its in the capital ship class and thats what all other flyable ships are as well. Capital ships. From the measly frigatte to the mighty dreadnaught. You will curse the bombers, fighters and gunships all around you but you ll never fly them yourself. And why would you? The weapons you have at your disposal are frightening and extremly destructive.\n\nThe game drops you in front of a Space station and your "campaign" is to find your aunt which vanished and is rumored to ve run into some trouble while following her not-so-white activities. Your ship has all the things you need to set off and start playing but pretty much everything is crap...at first.\n\nLets be clear about something.....when you "fly" your ship you ll do it on a 2D plane only. No fancy going "up" or "down" with such a large ship. You can only turn left or right and increase or reduce thrust.\n\nOn the other hand you are given your hull, armor on top and a shield generator to protect yourself from other big ships and small ones alike. In order to defend your newbie hide you have 3 weapon categories with multiple weapon choices in each being your Broadsides, your secondaries and your turrets. And here is where the game "hooks" you (or not) with its addictive elements. Pretty much every station offers a wide variety of modules in different qualities (starting at Mark 1 going to Mark 6) and in order to being able to buy these lil babies you gonna need a lot of credits. Sadly credits dont come around on their own so you got to chose from a list of activities in order to EARN credits until you can afford the next upgrade.\n\nMining, treasure hunting, bounty hunting, guild missions, cargo missions, combat missions, escort missions. This game offers a wide variety of things you can do. You ll still do it all on your ship of course but with the right pick of modules you can "specialize" your ship to certain mission types.\n\nMissions vary in difficulty based on your total worth and the opposition you ll encounter. Gear apart "how" you fly has a big impact on your survivability as well which is a nice touch IMO.\n\n\nThe flow of the game.\n\nYour playground is a star system with all its gas clouds, asteroid belts, planets and other space farers you can encounter. Each system is several AUs big and once you upgrade your engines (seperate module) you ll be able to visit other star systems which makes the whole picture bigger. Star systems offer different tiers of servces and challenges meaning in order to get the higher Mark modules you ll need to switch to different systems which are populated by harder enemies so this is the circle you face in RG. Upgrade to be able to do harder stuff which in turn leads to better upgrades etc.\n\nSystem to system travel is done via "jump gates" which are an instant switch. In-system you rely on your trusted warp engines to get you from A to B. The whole system is easy to understand and easier to use and it ensures that you can jump into RG for 15-20 minutes at a time and get things done. Yes missions are short affairs but nevertheless they can be engaging and entertaining.\n\n\nRebel Galaxy looks lovely. Its overall colorfull and the default music track I would describe as "cowboys in space" but hell....it fits.\n\n\n\nIts easy to use and hard to master. Upgrading to a new ship is always a big moment and find myself "itching" wanting to try it out. I dumped a whole lot of hours into this game simply because its FUN. Its not overall realistic and it could use some more complexity but its a cheap title made by 2 people. What you get for your money is AAA material in my book.\n\nI play several saves at the moment because the game allows you to take speific paths which dont go well with other paths so decisions need to be worked on and are really hard to lift once done. For example I have a save where I aligned myself with the pirate factions so most stations fire on sight, I m a wanted criminal by the militia and traders dont trade with me anymore. On the other hand I can pillage and loot whatever I find, spit on enemy militia destroyers and smuggle with illegal subtsnces to my hearts desire. Also there are some "pirate-only" ships and modules I can aquire this way.\n\nThe same is true for a military career. You ll be hunting pirates mostly and will be a respected captain in most corners of the galaxy. Some militia-only ships taunt you in case you are not doing all this out of your heart.\n\nIts kind of a "short" game. You have your storyline which brings you to mid game I d say after that the open game starts which is the whole galaxy with you dumped in the middle. From then on you gonna have to find your own goals sandbox style. Eventually you ll run out of ships to switch and modules to upgrade and will swim in credits. Thats when you ll notice your motivation to drop. Either you drop by from time to time to enjoy a mission or you start over. Apart from the storyline which is always the same you can pick fromseveral different approaches in the game which are all viably.\n\nI certainly dont play as much as I used to anymore but its still fun and to be honest, I consider it a good purchase....never regretted shelling out the cash (and for such a title thats actually cheap)\n\n9/10","January 12","true","175.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

I mainly did merc work, didn't find much need for mining, and within a little while I found myself turning to piracy as well.\n\nThis is a very well rounded game with good graphics, only the odd bug or two, and an amazing soundtrack that had me checking their web page, pretty certain I'd just heard Chris Cornell and Zac Brown going in again. Of course, it wasn't, but the hard rock sound track none the less seals the deal.

Your space ship cannot fly up or down though. Piloting and combat feels a lot like commanding a naval vessle. The designers could easily use the same engine and core data to make a naval game. Its not bad though. Not at all. Once you accept that's how this game is its super cool! Combat is fast paced and intense. Some fights are insane! It delivers with this very well.\n\nI am not far in the campaign but I enjoy what story I have uncovered. Rebel Galaxy shines the most for me with how well it has taken a space simulation idea and turned it into something fast paced. Its married to good action combat and randomly generated missions, events and economy. In a half hour you can have do a hard combat mission, go mining, trade commodities between stations and try to hack into a nav beacon.\n\nThis is both a blessing and a curse though because those few things I listed is really all Rebel Glaxy offers. Then again, that's pretty much the core features of a space sim too! The difference is the speed at which you can do things here. Its very drop in and drop out (or log off I mean in this case) gameplay. It is great fun for me as I love the X series. But this is NOT a space sim. Its LIKE a space sim with space sim LIKE elements. Which is cool. The focus here is on the action. And the sweet cowboy-like vibe you get everywhere.\n\nI strongly recomend this title with a 4/5\n\n=======\n\nI would really like the designers to come back and add some more stuff in a patch though.

I will not be playing this to see what has been fixed any time soon.  Seriously, I spent a lot of time and got no real reward for the MASSIVE grind.  I doubt I will ever beat this game.  Like I say below, the reward does not justify the time it takes.\n\nLike some others, I really like a lot about this game but it has some problems.  The kind of problems that caused me to just set the game down, and walk away.  I will start with what I liked.\nI liked the: Graphics\nShip design\nCombat\nCustomizing of ship loadouts\nChance to buy items low in one system and sell high in another\nAtmosphere\Environments\nAbility to add a custom soundtrack  (I used tracks from the Endless Space and Dungeon of The Endless Soundtracks and I liked it better than the normal soundtrack.)   What I did not like:The grind! and lack of variety in objectives - This is the biggest problem for me.  You have to grind a lot to progress, with no real change between the different star systems aside from harder enemies/missions + higher tier gear/ships.  This would not be so bad if there were more to do than the same basic missions repeatedly.\n(IMO: I think having some unique things to find around in space could make flying from port to port a bit more fun.  You know, things that add life and history to the universe you have created.  )\n\nDifficulty Spikes - As others have pointed out, there are delivery missions where upon near-arrival to your destination, a ring of fighter ships appear around you.  These ships are quickly reinforced by more ships.  Even with the threat level low, these fighters annihilate your shields and you get picked off pretty quick.  I have had to quit almost every one of these mission due to an absolute inability to get past these ships. (even after upgrading)\n\nMerchants Guild Missions - I had originally planned on focusing my time with the Merchants Guild.  On top of the painful delivery quests, I found the others tedious and boring.  Some require you to purchase a large amount of relatively uncommon items and then deliver them to a certain station.  The amount of time and cargo space required for those missions make them a total waste of time.\nThis is too bad because I much prefer the idea of playing a merchant/smuggler, and I like the ships they offer as well.  So I switched to the Mercenaries Guild because the missions are more fun and make more sense.\nExcept rescue missions.\nDoes anyone else have a huge problem with the rescue missions as well?  Maybe I just suck at those.\nTL;DR - You might like this for a while if you love space games.  But, there is a good chance that you will hit a wall where your time spent isn't worth the fun gained.  I really want to recommend this game, but cannot.\n\nIn one word: Plateau.","November 9, 2015","false","87.9"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","1"

Rebel Galaxy.\n\nIf you're wondering if Rebel Galaxy is a fun game to get, well, here's three stories to help convince you.\n\nScenario One: Laughing at Bandits.\nI took a mission to pick up a dead drop, pretty simple stuff. Fly to the location, use my tractor beam to pick up a box from the middle of nowhere, and then return it to the station I left from. Simple stuff.\n\nWell, apparently some folks didn't take too kindly to it.\n\nI come under attack from a wave of pirate fighters, but due to their.. ahh.. 'Lack of tactical prowess' they all come in at different points across the ice field. I start burning away, because there's no need for a fight, am I right guys? Besides, I have a small network of flak cannons (Secondary Weapon System), so these fighters can't do crap anyways.\n\nWell, one fighter (let's call him Jim-Bob) decides to go for it anyways.\n\nOne fighter against a Corvette. Bad choice Jim-Bob. About 10 seconds later, Jim-Bob is a frozen corpse in space, and seconds before my warp drive fully kicks in, all the bandits can hear is a "suck it, nerds!" across the comms.\n\n\nScenario 2: I'm a Big D*** Hero\n\nNot too long after that, I take a job to protect some miners. Might come under attack from some more bandits, maybe the same crew I ran into on the last job, no big deal, easy pickings. I head on out, enjoy the sights for a few seconds, before my ship tells me some unfriendly locals show up. Alright, no big deal, some fighters and a pair of gunships. Still in my old Corvette, with the flak system installed, so no big deal, they all get wiped out, I get paid, everyone's happy, the miners all lived, I got paid, played the hero, good stuff. I do my usual heading on out, accelerate to sublight, and hit the warp engine, all cool-like.\n\nI feel the kick-back of the warp engine, and am ready to sail off towards my next job...\nExcept I forgot to keep an eye on the asteroid off my port side, and make it about ten feet before dropping out of warp, where I embarrasingly have to boost past the asteroid, re-accelerate, and then hit the warp drive again.\n\nI can still hear the miners laughing...\n\n\nScenario 3: Lightning in Space. Not so Pretty\n\nSo, easy job. Eliminate this particularly nasty bandit who's been pillaging and marauding his way across the system. Easy-peasy according to my mission log, thanks to some recent upgrades after a few.. less-than-stellar performances on my next story mission. Head on out there, and as I come out of warp, I notice this beautiful blue nebula, with a bit of lightning. I think it's some really nice decoration for a pirate base, kinda fits the motif.\n\nAbout three seconds later, my computer's lovely voice tells me that my port shield is down, and as a I look at the display, not only is my port shield down, so are my fore and starboard shields. Right as the enemy enters weapons range. Beautiful, simply beautiful. That easy mission turned out to be not so easy. A wave of pirate strike craft, and a Corvette greet my in my old Corvette. I've been looking to upgrade to a nice frigate, but that doesn't exactly help me right now, I'm still in this now-battered heap after fending off most of the wave as the enemy Corvette, my target, starts speeding away.\n\nThankfully, sublight boosters help me catch up to weapons range, which, thanks to my shiny new Proton Cannons, is about three to four times longer than my old standard probably-shooting-a-space-potato broadsides. Well, apparently he notices how my guns are about to fire on him, and he turns towards me, not that far off my starboard side, when my helpful computer notifies me of another problem\n\n"Starboard shields down"\n\nWell, that's just perfect. the shields I NEED to be up are down, thanks to the space-lightning the pirates conveniently chose to hide in. I'm still kind of battered, a few scorch marks and maybe a piece or two of my hull missing, but this is the one guy I positively, absolutely, have to destroy. I open up with a salvo of Proton fire, and close range to get my Scatter Turrets (run of the mill space-laser "machine gun" turrets) to fire on him, hopefully preventing a bit of shield recharge. The gambit works, and despite a few more scorch marks to my starboard side, the enemy Corvette explodes, and the people of the system are safe once more!\n\nAnd I don't get caught on an asteroid this time, letting me feel like an actual good guy. Until I explode next, that is\n\n\ntl;dr: Buy the thing. Seriously. I would've paid 40$ for this, and they're selling it for a sale price of 18, and a regular price of 20.","October 20, 2015","true","45.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/290300/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","SUMMARY: A simple to play, but surprisingly deep space adventure sim with a lot of personality and style that gives you a solid "Space Western" adventure where you can carve your own path.\n\nIt took me awhile to get into Rebel Galaxy as, early on, the directions weren't that clear and the difficulty was erratic.  That's when I realized Rebel Galaxy, for all its great graphics and soundtrack, really is a throwback to the old "drop 'em in space and good luck" games of the past.  Once you realize you are on your own in just about every way, it all comes together.\n\nIn Rebel Galaxy you come to a distant set of stars to find out what happened to your Aunt Juno.  And from there you can do anything you want, from following her legacy, to trading, to piracy, to naming your ship "Cosmic Bannanahammer" and doing donuts in space.  It's pretty much up to you.\n\nBasic gameplay involves piloting your ship to different locations and pursuing different tasks - trading goods, fighting enemies, raiding ships, mining asteroids.  From firing broadsides to talking to people everything can be done with a standard game controller, which makes it extremely easy to play.  Though controls can get complex, the layout and design makes it very easy to get into the game.\n\nSo let's break down the usual parts of these games:\nPILOTING: Space is 2D here.  Sorry, 3D is just for display.  This may seem limiting, but it fits the easy-to-control method and keeps the game from getting insanely complex.  See, battles are done by . . .\n\nNAVAL BATTLE TACTICS: This may take a bit of getting used to, but the game emphasizes a mix of broadside weapons, turrets, and specailized items.  Learning to juggle when to attack, maneuver, and fire takes a bit of work, but is rewarding to get right.  Also some of your weapons are AI controlled, making life much easier.  Speaking of ship components . . .\n\nPLENTY OF SHIP OPTIONS: Equipment really matters in Rebel Galaxy and has tradeoffs.   Once you get your playstyle down you can buy and customize ships that fit you.  Little changes mean a lot, which is good because . . .\n\nPLENTY OF MISSIONS: Sure they're often find, kill, or trade, but they're fun and more importantly they have impact with your standing of various groups.  Pirates, Militia, Citizens, and more will come to regard you differentlly depending on what you do.  This gives you quite a few ways to play the game.\n\nLOTS OF LITTLE BITS: There's also a delightful amount of extras.  Trade advice and data that appears to help you trade.  Guilds to join. Bits of humor.  Random events that pop up to keep the game rich, from ambushes to data transponders.  The more you play the more you find.\n\nA STORY THAT SEEMS INTERESTING: At first I wasn't sure about the story, but a few missions in it actually got my attention.  You don't have to play the story, but still.\n\nA SENSE OF ATMOPSHERE: Finally the game really manages to create a great "Space Western" atmosphere, somewhere between Firefly, Cowboy Bebop, and its own thing.  This is helped by . . .\n\nA COWBOY BUTTROCK SOUNDTRACK: Really, the soundtrack is the icing on the cake, a bunch of country-rock hard-edged western type songs that complete the experience.  The details in this game really make it.\n\n\nIs the game perfect?  No.  Some of it's very standard game-play, if well-implemented.  The combat can be a bit twitchy and confusing.  Some of the data and info layouts could have been better done.\n\nThe thing is with Rebel Galaxy, most issues are really minor.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RCoonTPU/recommended/290300/","RCoonTPU","[NPU]RCoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RCoonTPU/","458 products in account","Introduction\n\nRebel Galaxy is the space swashbuckling brainchild of Double Damage, reminiscing of arcade space games like Freelancer, and is supported by an excellent Firefly-like soundtrack. Unlike most space arcade shooters, the game has no pitch movement, instead opting for travel along a single plane. The main game is set inside a galaxy, although it does feature multiple maps, relatively large in size. Despite its similarities, it does a whole lot of thing in a slightly different manner, from combat style all the way down to the way you travel. What you see is basically a new breed of space arcade gameplay, and very much feels like its own brand of shiny new original IP. Prepare yourself for broadside battles and inter-faction negotiations, along with a whole lot of lighting effects to blind you mid-mining.\n\nStoryline\n\nThis game actually has a rather interesting story line, which is something I didn’t expect. Basically I was expecting it to be like Freelancer in most ways, but be lacking in some department or other. Despite my previous disposition, Rebel Galaxy follows a decent storyline. Basically you’ve been sent a message from your old crazy Aunt, who actually turns out to be a swashbuckling badass space-pirate at the age of late 50’s early 60’s. You’re trying to find out where she is, and make some sense of this weird AI you’ve gotten a hold of. Needless to say you get backstabbed and used like no tomorrow, and very often end up murdering the people you started out helping. It’s all a bit up and down, but heavily broken up by side quests and random world events. It’s similar to Freelancer in that you really need to do side quests and random events in order to upgrade your ship between main missions.\n\nGameplay\n\nLearning Rebel Galaxy initially can be a bit odd. I went in expecting one thing, and discovered it was something different. The key problem is I was expecting something akin to most space arcade titles. I wasn’t far off, but I was enough for the game’s management to throw me a bit. From scanning areas to turrets with AI, that and the fact that despite manual aim there’s still an aim assist – don’t walk into this expecting Freelancer/Freespace/X-Wing. Take portions of a number of space arcade games, and you’ll eventually have a recipe for Rebel Galaxy. The mystification lasted only a short while in fairness, it’s just something new you have to get used to, but once you do it becomes second nature. To clarify, this is a good thing. What we have in Rebel Galaxy is something that feels at least a little bit unique, unique enough for us to be learning something new, while enjoying ourselves at the same time.\n\nI’d like to go on about how much I love this game, so let’s first get the crap out of the way. Two things disappointed me most. First and foremost is the aiming system. AI turrets are awesome, configurable, and there’s a whole bunch of them and they do their job. Manual aim however, felt consistently interrupted. When engaging in broadside battles the game is constantly doing what it thinks is best. I aim the broadsides at a ship, but there’s another smaller ship closer which the game’s AI thinks is a more important target. The catch is my broadside weapons are slow velocity projectiles, and quite frankly I don’t give a damn about that tiny piece of crap. My lasers will take care of it. Instead of simply aiming at the ship I want to kill (which is usually fine in most cases I might add), the auto-aim kicks in and starts shooting broadsides in a direction that is not where you’re pointing. I hate it when a game thinks it knows better than me, and is flat out causing issues for me in intense combat situations. This doesn’t happen all that often, but it’s enough to annoy me a bit. Freelancer had it right. Allow full manual aim, but add aim assist circles to shoot for to shoot ahead of an enemy’s flight path. Auto-aim is just plain interference, because if you want to adjust the game’s target, you have to go into scan mode and switch targets.\n\nThis auto-assist comes in a second form, with the game’s speed and travel system. I cannot abide it. I’m sorry, but throttling my sublight speeds and dropping me out of warp at the hint of a sparrow’s fart gets extremely irritating throughout the game. Basically warp can only be engaged when the game says so. Sublight can only be sped up to cruise speeds when the game says so. Give me control of my damn ship’s navigation, and stop farting about like my mother. Nothing has been more infuriating so far than travelling 6000 game-lengths and getting stopped three times between A and B because you skirted around an asteroid field. Freelancer solved it, but adding AI auto-avoidance around objects. You’d occasionally hit stuff and lose some shield, but no problem. Slowing me down, and then further slowing me down to the lowest sublight speeds, forcing me to turn ninety degrees and boost out of an asteroid field is immersion breaking.\n\nRant over. The rest of the game rocks. This game is not Freelancer. Stop right there. Take all those predispositions out of your head, and prepare to play an all new type of game. Movement is entirely on one plane, but that’s cool. It means you can focus more on your tactical (or woefully haphazard) combat with those big-♥♥♥ broadsides. Turrets have varying types of AI that can be programmed to fire at certain types of targets, and there’s so much variation in weapons it tickles me in all the right places. Combat feels punchy, it looks pretty, and quite frankly simulating space-pirates is an excellent idea. The easiest way to make money is to pick a mission and then do all the randomised events that happen on the way there. There’s tonnes to do, and an enormous solar system to do it in. You might think to yourself that after the first solar system you’re halfway done, but you’re wrong, there’s a tonne more, and each map is as big as the next. Quite simply put there’s an awful lot of content and a lot of sights to see.\n\nUnfortunately I can't fit my entire review in this section.\nTo read the full review, go to: http://www.nextpowerup.com/articles/rebel-galaxy-review/\nTo read the performance analysis, go to: http://www.nextpowerup.com/articles/rebel-galaxy-performance-analysis/","November 20, 2015","true","6.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

I liked Freelancer, I didn't like Rebel Galaxy.\n\nI felt like the camera was always way zoomed in and at a weird angle, and during combat it's pretty much always facing at a right angle to the direction you're moving (because of broadside combat) so I run in to asteroids a lot.  My second time out in a combat zone I ran into an asteroid that had something else next to it, and my ship got stuck such that it couldn't turn, and you can't go backwards, so I had to reload to get my ship free.\n\nIt feels like you're flying through something far more viscous than water.  I can forgive constant thrust = constant velocity in space games if they at least let you cruise along for a while without slowing down super fast when you disable thrusters.  This game feels like a naval combat engine with space combat art resources.  I think the ship in assassin's creed black flag has less resistance from the water than your spaceship does in the vacuum of space in this game.\n\nI also didn't like the weapons.  They auto aim at stuff, and you do broadside combat where you don't really have to lead or even aim close, your weapons all just kind of pick stuff and shoot at it.  The combat is very non engaging and easy, and if it were hard I'm not sure it would be anything but frustrating since there doesn't seem to be any strategy or skill involved.\n\nThe UI and the controls on keyboard and mouse are also not too great.  It seems like it might feel better on a console, but that's not much of a "consolation" on PC.","October 23, 2015","false","0.9"," 33 of 55 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","33","55","0","1"

We're very impressed with it. It's old school fun in a modern setting. The ships designs remind me very much of the Terran Trade Authority Handbook SPACECRAFT 2000 to 2100AD By Stewart Cowley.\n\nThe game is an open world sandbox with 14 galaxies. You fly around in big capital ships, which you can upgrade or trade in for a better/larger one. The ships can mine, collect, transport and fight. Mining is done in astroid fields scattered all over the galaxies. Each galaxy is full of spacestations, belonging to one of the 4 or 5 factions (sorry don't know for sure if it's 4 or 5). At the spacestations you can sell your mined items, but also buy and sell a lot of other commodeties. You can also upgrade and buy ships there, hire mercenaries to support you and select missions you want to play. Factions offer missions there and by doing them you will grow in popularity with them, while loosing popularity with others. The less popular you are with a faction, the more likely they will attack you when you encounter them in space. When you are really unpopular with a faction, they will not allow you to dock at their spacestations. Throughout the game you can gain or loose popularity however you see fit. Missions can be focussed on trading, mining, defending or helping others, smuggling and battling.\n\nThe ships are quite cool, all of them have a bit of an 70's - 80's scifi game to them. You can upgrade their strength, equipment, cargo space, weapons and much more. Quite some options available. To make things easy, the ships more one a 2D plane, in a 3D world. This works very well for this game. The act more like a ship then a plain. They have a main engine, sub warp enigne (booster), warp engine and a interstellar warp engine. Weapons consist of turrets and broadside cannons. You can let them fire pretty much automatic, or take control of indivual turrets. Fighting is done like sail ships do, facing sideways and firing away :D\n\nYou can fly around anywhere you like and while doing so you will encounter loot, pirates, astroid fields, others in need of assistance and more. This is all aside from the missions you can do. There are also guilds in the game, joining one or more will give you access to special equipment and ships. The ships you can fly in the game range from firefly size ships to battlestart galactica capital ships and beyond.\n\nOn top of all this, there's a full story with all kinds of missions and mystery going on. You can focus on the story, do it once in a while or even neglect it completely. Besides the main story, there are a few smaller subplots as well.\n\nThe best thing about all of this is the freedom you have. Go anywhere you like, play the way you like. Be a pirate, trader, merchant and so on. Follow a story, neglects, do side mission, explore and so on. Mix it all together. The game is really easy to get into, easy to play and offers all kinds of levels of mission, with a very low risk to a high risk. The further you fly into the universe to more hostile it gets and the more advanced upgrades and ships you discover. Easy to play and to pick, yet offering a good challenge as well. Flying is easy, just like driving a car. Battling is really done awesome, you get the whole star trek, battlestar galactica, star wars feel when doing so. No puny little fighter..... no massive firepower :D\n\nI guess that pretty much covers it, sure I forgot a thing or two. Is it worth it? Yes, without a doubt. The whole concept is done innovative and very well. Everything blends in and just works well together. It's a very welcome break from all the massive space mmo's and all the small spaceship focussed game.","October 20, 2015","true","72.7"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","21","33","2","1"

Think of Elite Dangerous in the ocean. The games combat takes place on more of or less of a two dimensional plane. In the the way that Assassins Creed IV Black Flag naval combat has become a bit of a standard. However fighter ships can go a bit above or below the playing field. Of course there are contingencies that allow you to deal with these inconveniences such as automated scatter turrets that can have a tactical assignments selected while you are trying to focus aiming your broadside hardpoints.\n\nThe game has faction warfare that evokes a feeling of Mercenaries. Some factions are needlessly hostile to you to begin with while others can be swayed through favors or pushed away by other actions.\n\nThere is no ship customization other than changing hardpoints, shields and deflectors. Or strait up buying a new ship. The game, despite its open nature, has a very linear progression. I see only 2 ways to go. You either become better at killing other ships or pick a frigate that is better at not dying whilst transporting cargo. Essentially be a bounty hunter bent on protecting the citizenry of the known universe. Be a space trucker and keep your nose clean at least in areas controlled by the militia or become space pirate. This is not necessarily a bad thing but in all honesty it feels very shallow and has a feeling (the entire experience) of being a tutorial to Elite Dangerous. Which again is fine, so long as you expect that going in.\n\nThere are commodities at each station. In essence you could just play the market to progress and get ahead. There are often events going on like a tech boom or famine where buying low and selling high should be a strait forward affair.\n\nThe game features a custom soundtrack option. And no, I don't mean like putting on a playlist from spotify. You actually set up custom pathing. As in, choose from list A for battles, List B for Exploration etc etc.. However the game features an OST that I consider quite superb. Its consists of some amalgam of slide guitar space cowboy jams and 90's grunge. Which feels not to far to removed from the serious/satire ratio that Borderlands possesses.\n\nTHE GIST\nThe game is basically a more friendly version of Elite Dangerous and that's not a bad thing.

Very much a Freelancer for the new generation, featuring Capital class vessels!\n\nTHIS GAME IS JUST FINE WITH A KEYBOARD AND MOUSE, DONT LET OTHER REVIEWERS TURN YOU OFF OF IT BECAUSE YOU DONT HAVE A GAMEPAD!\n\nSo, in Rebel Galaxy, the value of ALL of the parts you buy for your ship is fully refundable. Including ship chassis. You're free to experiment with new types of loadout at will. No charge for resale at all.\n\nThere's a stat in the pause menu that shows your Net Worth, including your ship and all of the parts you have on it, what's in your cargo hold, etc. It's a great way to do a single-player space exploration game.\n\nPeople complain a LOT about warping taking too long, but I don't find it a problem at all. You can get upgrades to your warp drive that increase the speed dramatically. As for hitting asteroid belts during a warp, you can and SHOULD watch for oncoming nebulae and asteroid fields. You can literally see them coming from a million miles away, and just steer out of the way. Snake around space for a better paralax view, so you can tell whether you're coming up on something big.\n\nCombat is on a 2d plane for capital class vessels, and a 3d plane for fighters and bombers. So, your turrets can hit stuff above and below you depending on their placement, and your side-guns are primarily for hitting the bigger stuff.\n\nThere is a surprisingly large number of ships in the game, I'd put my currently seen number at about 20. Each faction has their own set of ships on offer. I particularly like the trade faction's GIGANTIC verticall wall of shipping containers, bristling with turrets and cannons.\n\nWhen considering your loadout, you spend a lot of time trying to strike a good balance between equipping anti-fighter, anti-cap, anti-shield, or anti-armor. Each turret and cannon has it's own set of attributes, and the jack-of-all-trades stuff is lacking a little in the numbers department. Over all, weapons feel good and balanced between types, with a slight leaning toward Mining Lasers at the start. I found them good for the first system, and switched out to specialized guns later.\n\nThe cowboy music aesthetic is nice, very firefly. I ended up turning it off after a few hours of hearing the same four or five tracks, and loaded up a playlist with all the Star Wars music from the original trilogy. Definitely a good choice.\n\nBounties are very easy to get in to. You can find them at random when flying about by using your PULSE scanner, and waiting for the "Bounty Detected!" notice, then flying to the nearest enemy group. You can get map icons and waypoints to them by paying a small fee to bartenders at any station.\n\nWhile flying about, you'll come across lots of other stuff too. Message terminals that you can hack with a simple timed button-puzzle put waypoints on your map marking weapons caches and asteroid belts uncommonly rich in minerals. You can find distress beacons, traders or military who are fighting a losing battle and pay you VERY well to save them! You can also find "Pirate Lords" floating around out there. They are elusive and unusually powerful enemies with huge bounties on them.\n\nMissions are the same old cookie cutter, go here, kill stuff, gather items, come back. But! You can take three at a time, and bang them out really quick. Every station has missions, you can see the relative difficulty of each one as a color-coded mission title, green being easy, red being hard. It's actually quite accurate so far, hard missions definitely require some interesting strategies. The missions pay out as SOON as you complete the objective, so if it's just a kill order, you don't need to return for the reward. Super handy!\n\nSome of the later trade-faction missions are super lucrative, but require you to actually go find minerals on your own time. I got a mission to gather Pure Water that took me an hour or so due to NONE of the local stations having any, but that could be why I got the mission in the first place! I ended up mining out a few ice asteroids for the loot, and the reward was over $300,000.\n\nTrade itself in the game is very simple. Go to station, find merchandise that is selling low, travel around until you find a place to sell high. Each station you visit will book the sale price of each item FOR YOU, and then map them on a really clever line graph showing maximum price, minimum price, and the average price. This means you can do everything at a glance, and don't need to worry about note keeping on paper.\n\nCargo upgrades are pretty cheap, so most any ship can do some hauling. Obviously, gigantic hauling ships do have a lot more to offer that way though.\n\nSome ships concentrate much more heavily on rotating turrets, too. So if you don't like the whole "Broadside" dynamic, you really don't have to do it at all. I had a little cruiser with 7 turret slots and only 3 side guns, it was just perfect! The downside to a turret-ship is primarily cost. Turrets cost as much as the entire battery of your broadside guns. They lack a little in pure DPS as well, but you can easily make up for it with proper tactical positioning. Broadsiding is hard to line up against faster enemies, and makes you extremely vulerable to flanking by other enemy ships. It does have a pretty devestating hit if you nail another ship with the whole volley, though!\n\nYou can blast fighters to smithereens with a well-placed cannon volley, too. That's a little tough, but super satisfying.\n\nOver all, I rate this game very highly. Each of it's features feel polished to a mirror sheen. It's very, VERY well thought out, and plays like a dream. I've run the gamut of space-freedom games from EVE to Freelancer to EV-Nova, and I feel like this game is a shining star in the genre!","October 23, 2015","true","20.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

In truth I consider it "meh".  Its only real contribution to gaming as a whole is the broadside, Assassin's Creed 4 style ship to ship combat, which is a lot of fun.  The rest of the game is a pretty stripped down and bare bones space sim.  Almost all missions involve combat, even the trade runs.  Being knocked out of warp is commonplace and makes just getting from point A to point B needlessly tedious.  The universe has no depth, there are several factions with friend/neutral/foe ratings you can adjust, but none of them have any substance or even an explanation as to who or what they are.  Trading and mining profits scale poorly as such that they're not a real way to make money as the game progresses.\n\nAll of these things being said I did put 50+ hours into the game and earned all the achievements.  I enjoyed myself through at least some of that or I wouldn't have done it.  The real problem comes down to the fact that its just a bare bones game that does one thing well: combat.  This is a space game to get if you want to get in quick shoot stuff and get out.  Its also good for fans of the show Firefly who like that type of universe and that type of "space-western" soundtrack.  Personally its not my cup of tea but that's just a subjective opinion.

Above is a short video of me running through th first half hour or so of the game, below are my thoughts on Rebel Galaxy.\n\nTheHiddenLevels.com was provided a review copy by Double Damage Games and for that we thank them.\n\nThe opening soundtrack and just the music in general really gave that space junker, firefly, out in the verse where there is little law and less integrity vibe.. The following gameplay did not let this notion slip away. This is a fantastic western style space traveler and battle game. I was hooked pretty quickly by amazing music and voice acting, the graphics are impressive as well.\n\nI engaged my first enemy and honestly thought I was about to lose my ship when I shot them down just in time, the battles feel tense and while manuvering isn't the focus, you've still got to be crafty. The only thing that was a slight turn off was that other ships I was fighting were able to move on a 3D axis, but of course our ship is not capable of 3D flight. It is a game mechanic so that is the last I'll mention it, becuase the game is supremely fun even without that facet involved.\n\nThe ship building and upgrade possibilities are relatively deep, and offer a real variance in experience and gameplay. I really enjoyed the feeling of landing on new planets, talking to folks in smoky dive bars, and running errand / bounties for unsavory space characters.

It'll last the hardcore main story mission runners about 15-20 hours.  The main storyline seems short.  Most side missions are faction based, but pay well for the time involvement.  Side missions have some variety and are easy to find the location of and execute.  If you like doing side missions and answering every distress call, you can expect 50+ hours of gameplay.\n\nThere is a variety of ships each with their own specific stats, but you are more defined by your ship's equipment.  Multiple options for defenses, weapons, and components.  Once you get the largest ship with almost all of the best weapons, the enemies don't really pose a threat and the large dreadnoughts can be melted in under 10 seconds.  Looting is easy and your cargo capacity is upgradable, to a limit.\n\nControls are easy to use and doesn't require you to learn and use 100 different keys.\n\nThe soundtrack is great and is a mix of Rock, country, and blues.  It includes music primarily from guitarist Blues Saraceno (Poison, albeit briefly) and others.\n\nAchievements are easily attainable.  I finished them in 60 hours(all but one at 56), but I probably could have done it much faster if I wasn't meandering.\n\nGraphics are good and have plenty of good effects.  You have many options you can turn off.\n\nMinimum HW requirements are low, so it'll be playable on most people's gaming computers.\n\nThere are some things that could be improved if you analyze every aspect of the game.  This is not a sim, expect it to be somewhat arcade like.  The game appears to be aimed at combat and having a good time.  Don't get hung up on the trade system because it needs an overhaul.\n\nOverall, it is a well polished game with good graphics and a good soundtrack.  Buy it for $19.99 and enjoy it.","November 13, 2015","true","60.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

That means you can't fly up or down, only left or right.  However, smaller fighter planes and asteroids can fly beneath or above you, requiring your ship's turret placements to be more strategic.\nYou can trade, mine, steal, join factions, make factions hate you, help people in distress, escort ships, fight every time, flee every time (depending on ship speed).  You can play as good, neutral, or evil, or jump around and do whatever pays the most.\n\nThe game allows you to easily put your own music into it.\nYou can resell every ship or item for 100% retail value.  This means you can test out ships, weapons, defenses, etc. without fear of wasting money.  This is a nice way of getting around the fact that you can only own one ship at a time.\n\nI think this game is definitely worth the price.  As of writing this I have played 32 hours.  I'm not done with the main story line, and I don't think I will be for a while.  There is too much money to be made, and too many ships and ship upgrades to buy.","October 26, 2015","true","34.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The fights are frantic and intense, but very fun. I have no idea how much story I have left, but I'm looking forward to seeing what happens, and the many, many battles I will have to fight before I get to the end.\n\nOne thing I discovered late is hiring mercenaries from a bar. They are helpful, but have personalities that add to the fun of a mission.\n\nThe music is a great mood setter, the graphics are good, and believe it or not, locking us to two dimensions makes the fighting more fun because it reduces the complexity of navigation and lets you focus on ship position and weapons timing.\n\nFun+++","November 14, 2015","true","46.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Its got good graphics, and the alien voices are pretty cool, especially when they say words you recognize in the subtitles. The music isnt your typical space game ambient or electronica, its a kind of bluesy rock that reminds me of Pandora (Borderlands). Its great.\n\nThe weird thing about this game is it looks 3d, but its actually on a 2d plane (no Y-axis). Think a top down space sim like Escape Velocity, Ring Runner, Trancendence or any of those, where you are moving on a 2d plane. But imagine the game has a similar POV as the X series. Its really weird and disorienting to be in front of a station and not be able to dive under it.\n\nAgain, let me state that the game is *lightweight*. Not casual, just not as deep as a game like X3. If you love incredibly in-depth games like X3, Eve, or any of those, you will probably find this a bit too shallow.\n\nPeople just breaking into the space sim genre, or those of you who prefer lighter weight or 2d space sims will probably like this one.

It has you, the protagonist/antogonist, piloting a myriad of ships on a 2D plane while searing holes through smaller ships buzzing around you.  It's a simple game with beautiful visuals and a non-complex playstyle.  It takes a few minutes to get the controls down, but once that's done, it becomes second nature.\n\nIt's the choose your own adventure book of the space World.  Want to be a militia-supporting pilot that tries to do the right thing?  Ok.  Prefer to be a pirate that melts the armor of miners and traders?  Ok.  Want to be a miner or trader?  Ok.  Bounty hunter?  Done.\n\nIt has capital ships to fight/pilot, an array of modules/weapons to upgrade and many missions to accept and complete.  There is a propensity for the missions to get shallow, but the combat is fun enough to continue.  The desire for me to have the biggest, baddest ship in the Galaxy continues to drive me.  If I find myself getting a little weary from the missions, I go mine, or trade.  I find myself thinking about how I want to build my next ship.  Do I want an array of beam lasers?  Or do I want to build a missile boat?\n\nThe game does have a storyline arc, but I'm not fully through it yet, so it's difficult for me to comment on it.  I am intrigued though, because I want to see where it goes.  Since that's the case, it has sufficiently pulled me in enough for me to continue.\n\nThe music is terrific, and the game offers the ability to point toward your own local set of music based on triggers.  Want your collection of dubstep to play during a battle, but have a desire to have your atmospheric collection to drone on when you're just flying around?  Totally doable.\n\nFor the price, even at full cost, it's my opinion that the game is worth it.  It's a fun time sink that allows me to drop the "why so serious?" facade and just play a fun game involving lasers and explosions while making my own choices.","June 2","true","16.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Honestly, at this point the only thing that I dont particularly care for is the fact that there isn't any kind of co-op/multiplayer mode to it.  The story line was compelling to the point that (aside from getting the distress call or unknown signal source) that i found myself wanting to know what would happen next about midway thru it.\n\nThe soundtrack is very nice, but as with other games, when i want to listen to something else, i mute the music in game and play my own play list.\n\nThe Broadside combat i throughly enjoy as i enjoy other games such as Black Flag (console), World of Warships, and back in the day Starfleet Command.  To many space sim games that do give you the whole 3D still even lack the simple ability to do a loop.  So why bother calling it a 3d game? (yes i pointing my finger at you STO and EVE)\n\nThe missions will get repetive, but honestly, what game doesn't make your grind once you reach that certain point?  And there are enough different ships in the game to let you find the "one" that fits your play style.  I would love to see more ships added eventually.  (i want to fly that Proteus (red devil cruiser/dread (has the look of the Galactica to it))).   I would pay a little more for a DLC with the ability to fly the Alien/Pirate faction ships.\n\nAs one other person mentioned, there is no cookie cutter build to deal with all missions.  The only ship that will come close to that is the End game Dreadnaught, but all that does is make you a Jack of all trades and Master of none.\n(small spoiler below)\n\n\n\n(small spoiler below)\nThe only constant you can get is the Broadsides destroying everything in 1-3 volleys unless your doing certain Heroic mission.\n\nI hope this game continues to add more to it, but if it don't, i've gotten a great game for less than $20.","October 26, 2015","true","62.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's a casual game which is a good thing for me considering how time consuming many space based games are. Rebel Galaxy just lets you jump straight in and start having fun.\n\nThe attention to detail is one of the most impressive things, most noticably the sound effects and music. Firefly was clearly an inspiration here. Full voice acting is a refreshing change from walls of text in many new space games have used.\n\nIf I had any complaints it would be that being 2D does feel a little restrictive, but I get why they did it. This could have been something really special if they made it with PC's in mind instead of consoles (but thats just me still hoping for the utimate PC space game to arrive). Dont let that put you off, it's good fun and well worth the price.\n\nSomething to add - I've noticed people complain about being dropped out of warp due to asteroids and debris. That happened to me the first time I played, but then I realized you can steer around them while in warp. It's very easy to see objects coming up in the distance and it hasn't happened since.","October 20, 2015","true","45.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Rebel Galaxy...\nRebel Galaxy is a game with a space setting that locks you in a 2D plane. You can steer right, you can steer left and that's it.

Whether intended or not, the title is a loving tribute to all "Cowboy Movie In Space" stories, from Star Wars to Firefly. As with any other similar offering, the startlingly addictive travel-fight-upgrade loop is crafted to keep you hooked, and hooked I was.\n\n"Rebel Galaxy," at the pick-up-n-play level, offers a nifty sort of subversive, stripped-down take on maneuvering and shooting. This isn't a game about twisting and turning in every possible direction. Instead, you're locked on a 2D plane, with your abilities to both manage your loadout and hop into manual fire-control being of paramount importance. This is not to say that maneuvering and mobility aren't influential. Rather, it's to say that the approach to those aspects is much more focused; The "domain" is restricted to a relatively simple mechanic that's easy for the player to recognize and iterate upon.\n\nWhat's very interesting to me is how this connects to the overall backdrop of the experience. Especially with the "broadsides" element, the way the ship-combat works makes that part of the game a "Tall Ships In Space" sort of activity, which is usually mutually exclusive from the "Cowboy Movie In Space" genre. An odd sort of outcome, though, is that for all the emphasis on the broadsides, the game ends up subverting them. Matching speed and hammering away at an enemy is fine if you outclass them, but you're far better off getting on their tail and letting your turrets do the work. A smaller ship can really beat up on bigger adversaries that way, because the truly frightening firepower can't hit you.\n\n"Rebel Galaxy" doesn't quite hit a perfect mark. The way the interaction is broken up into three modes is strange and clunky, with two kinds of scanning (the pulse and detail scans) being strangely divorced from each other in both where they are found and how they work. Also, the "loot" value/ mission value/ mission difficulty/ equipment cost curves start off being very nicely tuned, but then seem to diverge as the game gets into the late stages. Particularly frustrating were missions labeled as being relatively safe, where that label apparently pertained only to the very beginning of the mission. A few moments into the actual meat of the encounter, and you might find yourself surrounded by a large number of very dangerous opponents.\n\nThe problems are very small, though. "Rebel Galaxy" is a truly worthy effort that is fun to play and manages to have its own identity. I hope there are more like it over the horizon.","March 7","true","41.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

That is, until my friend introduced me to this.\n\nIt literally took me five minutes of listening to the soundtrack and watching him play the game for me to get hooked. It was one of the few games on Steam I purchased at full price, and I was not disappointed.\n\nDespite its Indie tag, it doesn\'t feel like an indie game. The visuals are spectacular, the campaign is entirely voice-acted (even the alien species), and the combat is great.\n\nI don\'t think I need to explain the plot or setting in detail. You\'re in space. You\'re finding ancient ♥♥♥♥. Uhh... Untrustworthy aliens/Australians. That\'s all you need to know.\n\nThis game does the RPG-style building-up of your equipment very well. You start with a dinky little ship with a laser. After you\'ve completed a few missions and/or saved/looted some traders, you can buy better lasers. But wait! Your ship\'s too small for any more lasers, and you\'re finding it difficult to deal with pirates/police! Well, now you\'ve got to get a bigger ship that can withstand more damage and wield more lasers. You complete a few missions and save/loot some more traders...\n\nThe game gets progressively difficult in a way that takes you out of your comfort zone. You can continue to do missions in your current system where enemies aren\'t hard to beat, but the reward is significantly smaller than that in more difficult systems. Additionally, you can only get better upgrades to your ship in harder systems. Frequently, you\'ll find yourself battling against a superior opponent, only to either destroy them or escape at the skin of your teeth.\n\nThe difficulty does peak at some point though. Enemies don\'t seem to get much harder or meatier just as you\'re able to get MK6 weaponry (last tier), while you can still acquire better ships and better equipment. Once you\'ve got the money to afford a Blackgate ship, the game is practically over.\n\nThe trading system is not as powerful as simply completing missions, but I overheard that the trading system used to be busted, allowing players to make millions within an hour by only trading. Either way, you can still make a hefty sum from researching how each \'event\' changes commodity prices (such as when a planet/station\'s at \'War\', the price of Ammunition goes up).\n\nIf you\'re looking for a great singleplayer game that\'ll most likely last your 10-20 hours, this is the perfect game, ESPECIALLY for an Indie game. It\'s not confusing, combat\'s satisfying, the soundtrack is rockin\', and... just, everything is there.","June 1","true","61.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Anddddd....... 8 hours gone just like that. And another 7 hours in the second day.....\n\n\n\nOk here is my short review about the game after playing it for 2 days:\n\nPROS:\n- Nice graphic\n- Nice background music\n- You can change the background music with music you have, you even can change it for specific situation like music in combat or just gliding around. I use battlestar galactica bgm and it's awesome\n- Awesome broadside combat, blast away enemy ships with lasers, photons, or whatever you have\n- Lots of customization for your ship\n- Cool ships\n\nCONS:\n- For unknown reason, when I enter the main menu sometimes the game crash\n- You can't customize ship paint, I really hope I can do this\n\n\nNEUTRAL:\n- You can't go up and down in this game, pretty weird since the setting is in space. But this make the game easier to play\n- No mod support now AFAIK. If there is a mod support, this game will be even more awesome\n\nIt's on sale now and I reccomend you to buy this especially if you are a fan of space battles.","February 7","true","33.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

You control a space cruiser flying around the galaxy trading and fighting.  Make money from trading at space stations buying low, selling high, and use the money to upgrade your ship with new weaons, armor, and equipment.  This will allow you to take on pirates (or become a pirate) and loot your fallen enemies.  Trade, fight, loot, upgrade, repeat until you have enough for a bigger ship and repeat the process.  This is much what I imagine Han Solo and Chewbacca did before running into Luke and Ben in Mos Eisley.  Do you want a Han Solo simulator or a Firefly simulator?  This is pretty much it.  I also enjoy the amount of choices the devs chose to throw at the player.  For almost every mission you have multiple options of how to proceed, be it violently or non-violently.  I have yet to see how many of these choices play out, but Rebel Galaxy has made a very good impression in my first few hours of gameplay.","October 20, 2015","true","36.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It appears to have the full range of activities in the Freelancer tradition: exploration, trading, mining, and loads of combat. You have faction relations that can go up or down depending on who you do missions for, and there seem to be space ports all over the place to dock at for missions and equipment. I've only barely scratched the surface of the main story, but it's intriguing so far.\n\nCombat seems to be the focal point of the game, and it's really well done. I'm not sure how much more layered it can get, but it's nicely varied so far. You control a capital ship rather than just a fighter, and you seem to have two primary classes of weapons: broadsides and turrets. Broadsides do massive damage, but are slow and can't track fast moving ships. They're great against other capital ships though. Turrets can lock onto targets and tear up small fighters, but they can overheat if you don't give them a break from firing. And the cool thing is, they will automatically fire while you're controlling the broadsides. In addition, you have a thruster boost mechanism that can increase you speed, but which can also be depleted from over use, such that it needs a rest to recharge. On top of that, you can get a deflector add-on which is something like an extra shield that absorbs essentially all incoming damage. When it's up, you can't fire your weapons, and it has limited energy which drains over time or rapidly when it's taking hits.\n\nWhat all this means in practice is that you've got a lot of systems and energy bars to keep track of, which keeps combat really engaging. It was a tiny bit overwhelming or frustrating initially, but I felt like I got the hang of the essentials within maybe half an hour. At that point, combat was a blast.\n\nI can't say much about the main story, since I've only gotten a couple missions into it, but it seems to revolve around some form of advanced technology and finding a lost relative. Interesting enough that I want to see where it goes. The world feels large and full of activity. Visually, the game is gorgeous, with great effects for all the weaponry, and the music is awesome, a dustry, countrified rock soundtrack that really adds a lot of character to the experience. I love me some electronic music, but this is a nice change of pace that gives the game a distinct personality.\n\nIn summary, if you ever played the old Wing Commander games, or Freelancer, or anything similar, you will love this game. It even more closely resembles another game call Nexus: The Jupiter Incident that came out about a decade ago, which had an equally interesting story. I'd say the primary difference with that game is that combat is much more refined and well done here. If you're like me and aren't sure, but crave space adventures, get this game.","December 27, 2015","true","9.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

You'll be using your boosters to keep yourself alongside larger enemy ships so you can use your broadside cannons, timing your deflector shield uses to block their incoming broadsides/missles, and spamming X button to fire EMP flak at the smaller ships so you can focus on the big target.\n\nI find myself having to think about positioning alot, and having to boost away from larger ships or swarms of small craft while i swing my own ship around because the big hole in my leftside hull cant take it anymore, so i reorient and come in from a new angle.\n\nSo far about 50% of my combat has been outside of mission running. You'll often find distress beacons, get tips from bartenders on bounty locations, or just plain run smack into an enemy fleet while warping somewhere else.\n\nCertain missions seem really unbalanced at first, but after refitting to the right weapons or adopting new tactics, suddenly theyre totally manageable.\n","October 21, 2015","true","53.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robw/recommended/290300/","robw","Rob. W.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robw/","292 products in account","Rebel Galaxy....\n\nProbably the most fun I've ever had with a space game like this ever. The soundtrack alone attracted me to this wonderful game, only because it's such a perfect match. Though I must say, at the time of writing this, I have roughly 60 hours set in right now into Rebel Galaxy, but it does not match the potential amount of hours I COULD be spending playing this game. With it's randomly generated "Systems" or whatnot, it provides a relatively fresh experience with every new playthrough. The only downside with this model, is there is a general process that is the same, and it goes with the advancement in tech vs. the contracts price in every system. Right out of the start cutscene, I could spend maaaybe 2-5 hours building up enough money for a new drive that allows for Solar System Gate use, and start working easy contracts in the furthest system. Run into no conflict, and in the matter of hours attempting at getting high tier gear relatively early on in the story breaks the immersion a little bit. Even if you were to stay true to the story aspect, you can get to a specific point and still go do side quests and contracts for money.\n\nThere are many directions that you could take with every playthrough, and thats what I'm getting at exactly. No matter how hard or easy you make it for yourself, it's still amazing what one could do in this game.\n\nI will have to say, it does break a little bit of realism/immersion at times, when Juno talks  about "your small ship and how it may be time for an upgrade", and you already maxed everything out. It just seems weird to me. Little prompts like that. Another thing that concerns me is the difficulty overall, it goes from baby steps to smacks in the face pretty quick, and the overall progression seems a little awkward when moving up in tech. I found that the only way I could survive going up in difficulty for the next system was to earn a ridiculous amount of money, go over there, and buy the highest tech because that would be the only way I could even survive there.\n\nThe whole concept of Mining or Trading seems a bit awkward to me, because if you want to mine, you have to go at it for a long time to make any real profit. It feels almost useless to me (Mining), unless you find that golden nugget in a desert, the Antimatter Specks, which I have yet to find. The only way you can even make trading profitable is if you attack convoys or traders due to the large amount of items they have that are super profitable OR fighting Pirate lords with high end ship systems, though, they are insanely hard sometimes.\n\nPROS:\n1. The whole badass atmosphere (with music) gives the player confidence and has a really good feeling while flying through space in my awesome ship with big weapons\n2. Optimization and level of content allow the highest graphics even on lower end machines\n3. Ship designs seem really well thought out and allow for a multitude of playing styles\n\nNEUTRAL:\n1. Combat feels tasteful and well done, though lack of ways to end your enemies in your travels feels saddening at times. When I'm flying past, I feel the only way to really do damage is broadsides or lots and lots of turrets. If only there were more ways, it would feel just perfect.\n\nCONS:\n1. Mining is tacky and has a useless feeling. One could be mining for hours, but unless they are mining the right materials that usually scarce in most astroid fields, so it doesn't feel fulfilling\n2. Solar Systems never really feel unique, a few system is a new system. It may have labels that some places are better for trade or mining, but I haven't really noticed a difference anywhere.\n3. Factions seem pointless sometimes - because I could be super friends with the militia and citizens, but NOBODY else would like me, and it wouldn't matter because I wouldnt gain anything from them anyways. The only other faction that matters to some degree is the Red Devil Raiders, but they offer mid-game gear from my current understanding. If the other factions had more purpose and personality, I'd be more inclined to try improving relations with them, IF there was a way besides surrendering all of my cargo whenever they see me.\n\nRebel Galaxy is definitely a fun game and I highly suggest you give it a try!\n\n---NOTE---\nThe game is not far from its release date, so I expect a lot of changes in the games further history, but for now, this is what I see :)","November 26, 2015","true","58.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you're looking for a game that is very deep and has fully fleshed out trading, reputation, 3d flight you may want to look elsewhere (X3 or Starpoint Gemini 2 come to mind). I don't think that's what the developers were trying to accomplish here. I think they wanted the fun and engaging nature of a naval pirate game with some light-weight trading mechanics, where the focus is kept on the combat with the loot system basically for rewarding the player and enabling progression. In that I think they succeeded and did a great job in bringing that feel to a space setting while adding a distinctive feel with the music and pace. I will say that I did have a minor issue with the game where once I found the right setup it became pretty easy to cheese my way through the fights, but it was still a blast.","November 29, 2015","true","26.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I picked this game up on sale hoping it would provide me with what I had been looking for and was happily satisfied.\n\nYou start Rebel Galaxy off in a tiny ship and are quickly thrown into this massive galaxy head first with no real direction and plentiful choices on what to do first, an amazing first impression. After a few hours I found that some of the missions were kind of repetitive so I moved on to a different sector to try a new guild. While the missions did vary there are a lot of fetch quest style side missions that unfortunately did not change as the game progressed.\n\nRebel Galaxy shows you straight from the start these giant dreadnaught class ships worth $15m+ while you are making a measly $10k a mission. This while great, also lead to a desire to acquire better ships and gear as quickly as possible. The problem with this choice is due to the games difficulty system, which  is never explained. Rebel Galaxy seems to use four mechanics to set difficulty; system rating, mission difficulty and the last two are based on what hull class and gear type you are using. The game only considers your highest individual type of gear to set the difficulty which can lead to some annoying situations where you are severely outclassed by the enemy ships .\n\nThese two points should not dissuade you from this game, however. Almost every other aspect was fantastic. The music, while I found not suited to space exploration, was great and has been well received by the community . The ship types and styles all were unique and looked great while offering a variety of build possibilities and attack styles. The weight and feel of the ships during combat and the combat itself.\n\nThe battles at the core of the game can be amazingly chaotic, the large varieties of ships / builds with different amounts of each in a fleet can lead to some of the biggest fights you have ever been in. I went into a great number of battles ridiculously outnumbered and when surviving in the final moments after a tense and carefully executed fight,  let out a profanity or cheer due to the satisfaction of these sometimes epic encounters.\n\nOverall this game scratched an itch that I've had for years that nothing has come close to. For the price and the amount of time you can get out of this game I couldn't recommend it enough.\n","January 18","true","63.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Mechanics-wise this is basically Freelancer 2, except with far better 2D naval combat, randomized systems and sectors, far less "loadscreen" traveling (instead you free-form warp and dodge obstacles and it usually takes 40-60 seconds) and the endgame is you piloting gigantic behemoths with dozens of automated turrets in gigantic battles with up to a hundred ships.\n\nThe variety of mission types for the generated missions is reasonable but limited, so it's up to yourself to pick the type you enjoy (pro-tip: escort missions usually pay that much for a reason) and to get the insane(ly expensive) gear you'll need need to either batch a few dozen missions or - much more exciting - pick the contracts that the game deems far too hard for you and play smart (and hope for the best). So that's both difficulty selection and clever risk-reward choice to let you pick the pace you enjoy.\n\nThere are definitely a number of systems that feel functional yet rudimentary that i'd like to see expanded for a sequel, but this delivered everything i always thought i wanted from the larger space games like Elite or EVE (ha) or that other sad joke in a much more condensed and enjoyable package.\n","January 5","true","24.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Add to it some hearty music and Rebel Galaxy feels warm and alive, unlike its much more expensive predecessors.\n\nThe main gameplay feature that sets this space sim apart from all others is that the battle happens with Black Flag type naval combat, where the ship stays on a flat plain and fires cannons from the sides.\n\n\nPro's:\n\nGood flow: you complete missions, scavenge ships, buy upgrades, move to more dangerous areas, buy better ships, help out allies, do more missions, etc. It gets addicting.\n\nDynamic unbalanced world: I once came across an enemy capital ship in a low-difficulty space that annihilated two militia capital ships and was clearly overpowered for the area. Another time, I came across a giant pirate armada next to a planet. Yet another time, the mission was labeled hard but turns out to be super easy if you are fast enough. Maybe these are all bugs, but they make the game feel more dynamic and realistic.\n\nMusic: slide guitar rock is great. I bought the songs before the game even came out.\n\nCombat is fun. Lots of ships flying all over in the colourful chaos of battle.\n\nCustomizable fighting styles: Buy a fast ship or a slow mammoth; long range torpedo boat or point-blank cannon. You decide.\n\nGood value for your money.\n\n\nCons:\n\nSaving behavior. At the time of this review, the game saves whenever you quit the game or at a station and there is only one save. This means: 1. you cannot load a previous game if you mess up and 2. if anything happens to your save, you are screwed. This means you have less freedom to experiment. I have yet to find a game where the checkpoint system did not annoy me.\n\nFlat space: While the naval combat system does work, part of what I love about space sims so much is the freedom to fly anywhere and by restricting the movement to a plain you are cutting at the core of what is interesting about space sims.\n\nTrading system is mediocre: You can buy low by paying attention to the news and then sell high but it is nowhere near as profitable as doing even the easiest of the combat missions and just does not work very well.\n\nIn time, a few annoying bugs did reveal themselves, though nothing gamebreaking.","November 24, 2015","true","39.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

But I'll be sure to be more cohesive at this point.\n\nFirstly, the music is great. As in, bloody fantastic, perfect, chill-inducingly delectable. It makes me so happy to hear a westernized form of country again, even if it is more modern. It practically makes me weep with joy and happiness. The music guides you along a beautiful path of twisted flaming wreckage and bloody gorepiles in space of the helpless rended limb from limb by a cascade from your turret networks. Truly, it makes me nearly froth with inarticulate rage and glory, my blood flowing in great cascades from my eyelids to hear this music. I would rate it a 7/10 or even 8/10 if I am particularly in the moment.\n\nNext we have the gameplay, an enormous bulky monster that growls across the scarred membranes of your cerebral cortex. First of all, it is weighty. I feel as if I am a space marine interred in a mighty dreadnaught of the God Emperor of the Mandkind whenever I go into warp, barreling on to my inevitable destination and perhaps description. Secondly, the combat makes my eyes burn with the dancing hatred of a thousand devils, shewn from the eternal Blood War by a great swathe of undead demons lead by Orcus himself. I revel in the heinous and most deliciously extensive.  The pound of my ordnance and turretry as I combat the vile hordes of heretics and pirate scum makes me giggle as a mentally deranged serial killer escaped from Alcatraz. Truly, this game excels in its gameplay.\n\nFinally, as I must say, the westernized feel bleeds over heavily into the characters, making for interesting dialogue and contact with either unknown xeno scum or unwashed and mangy of hide baffoons. As the clink of aged coin, illicit goods, or untold amounts of credits flow from my scabrous hands as we exchange evil pleasantries and oafish camaraderie. I can do nothing but appreciate this.\n\nI recommend this game highly my battle brothers, my dark souled companions, my vicious murderers and my fellow hiver scum.  You will do no better on this day if you seek endless battle, horrific suffering, and countless bouts of larcency, lies, and lack of litigious action.\n\n“The past shall consume the future, the dead shall consume the living, and chaos shall reign supreme!”\n--- Unicron\n","October 24, 2015","true","11.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","8","13","3","0"

If you are a fan of Firefly, and if you like Star Trek - Star Wars style space combat, this game is for you. Although not being a masterpiece; the game has a nice atmosphere, wonderful music and sound effects, flashy explosions and lasers, detailed unique ship designs, in short: it has a %85 healthy body and mechanics.\n\nPros & Cons:\n\n- The depth of space looks nice, however the colours are mostly vivid mostly and too luminous for space. Though it's less depressing :))\n\n- Warp and Jump concepts are very nice.\n\n- Thumbs up for weird aliens, their creative languages and weird ships (gets weirder further you play the main mission :)\n\n- The game lacks of citizens living wandering around when you visit a station. When you visit a bar, you can only have the bartender and your hired gun, which is so unrealistic.\n\n-Diplomacy needs to be worked on some more. And yes, I agree with the other guy: developers need to put a "reputation" system inside the game. When a guy destroys 100 capital ships and some 500 fighters, weaker enemies should run away from you on sight, or at least try ;) There is a "Hail-dialogue" system in game. Little bit impractical. You can choose to intimidate your enemy which I succeded several times. Still nobody says "Oh noo! it's the guy who eats destroyers in breakfast! We frakking need to disappear right now!"\n\n- After 30 hours repeated side missions decrease the fun. Fortunately the main quest saves it from boredom.\n\n-  The turret manual targeting sucks, it's pretty hard to choose your target in real time combat. You can of course "tab" and lock your target but I don't like wasting my time when i have 20 meteorites to hit around me (yeah you can do mining and sell the ore you extract)\n\n- You have many options to outfit your ship with deflectors, shields, rockets, lasers and such and especially with useful components. The turret's locations are important, nevertheless you can't just drag and drop your weaponry on the ship as you like. You will need to know by trial and error which turret is which and install-uninstall the weapons until you find the right one (I have 8 turrets on my ship for instance).\n\nThat's it for now :)","November 11, 2015","true","63.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's no Hearts of Iron III in terms of complexity but, heck, sometimes you just want to watch pretty explosions and feel like a space cowboy, right ? On this front, Rebel Galaxy delivers in spades. It's got more personality than a Hell's Angels clubhouse and the looks of that blonde cheerleader you lusted after in high school. I've read somewhere that it was made by two guys. If that's true, that's pretty amazing. Massive overachievers, they.\n\nI bought it about 10 days after release and have yet to encounter any significant bug. Sure, I would have liked a bit more depth in the missions, perhaps some RPG elements, or a touch of strategy but it would be a national politician-level lie to say that I didn't get my twenty bucks' worth of entertainment out of it.

We're talking Outlaw Star, Firefly, Dark Matter, Battlestar Galactica, etc.\n\nI was initially sold on the soundtrack alone (seriously, just watch the first trailer and you'll know what I mean). I thought I would lament the loss of a Z axis in flight/combat, but because of playing on a flat plane, it plays very similar to Assassin's Creed Black Flag's ship-to-ship combat, and as such it's very smooth, easy to grasp, and fun.\n\nPros:\n+ Excellent Soundtrack\n+ If you don't like the soundtrack, or want to add your own flair, the soundtrack can easily be replaced with your own music, separated by category (idle spacefaring, combat, space station), and your own music can be played along with the included soundtrack\n+ Smooth combat\n+ Lots of spacecraft\n+ Well made stock market style economy\n+ Planetary events add strategic value to trading\n+ Feels like you're right inside the Outlaw Star or Firefly universe\n+ Later fights are challenging, but fun\n+ Warping between planets is very relaxing\n+ Space is big. Each solar system is pretty massive, so expect to warp a lot\n+ Inside jokes and references to other sci-fi media is plentiful\n\nCons:\n- A bit grindy, especially early on\n- Missions are fairly repetetive\n- Some later fights can be brutal\n- Losing a big battle means going back to the last station you docked at. Dock often\n- No piloting small fighter craft\n\n\n8/10 Would soar like a leaf on the wind","January 22","true","40.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then this might just be the game for you.\n\nIn Rebel Galaxy you take reigns of a huge ship and carve your own path through a randomly generated quadrant of space. You can choose the path of a hero and save those you meet from a vast array of pirates and rogues. Or you can fall prey to greed and debauchery, siding with the Red Devil Cartel and carve your way through every enemy that stands before you.\n\nBut that being said you could choose to do neither. There is always the option to be a humble miner and strike it rich in one of the vast amounts of asteroid belts and nebulae that litter the universe. Or perhaps the life of a trader is more up your alley, with a huge amount of commodities and a living breathing market place that varies from station to station and can be influenced by every day events the choice is yours.\n\nThe game looks great, it may not be the most stunning graphics available today but I loved how it looked. The ships have super details models, the stars and planets were a joy to look at. The battle effects were bombastic and colourful. Every shot from my huge broad side barrage lit up the night sky as it ripped through the hull of my enemies.\n\nThe audio is fantastic too. The music chosen for the sound track really adds to the title; each song filled with a defiance that really gets the heart racing and only adds to the reminiscence of Firefly or so many spaghetti westerns that said screw you to the man. The sounds were great as well, the whirring up to using your warp drive or the blasting sounds of laser-fire as it rips through shields and hull alike. The only let down is some of the voice acting was not stellar, but what’s there is good enough to convey the story.\n\nSpeaking of which the story serves only one purpose, to convey your ship from one star system to the next. Most of the adventure in this title is not from the main plot but from the tales you form yourself. Taking on a trade mission and getting ambushed in a system that is far beyond your ships abilities, warping in to help a trader being pirated by xeno scum or the joy of stumbling upon a fleet of pirates and having them throw your offer of surrender back in your face and blasting them to dust as punishment. The main plot is not bad by any means but the game is so much more.\n\nNow gameplay, there are so many facets that it would be impossible to go through them all. The main game is either menu-based, exploration or combat. The menus are as expected. But the meat of the game is its exploration, so much to see and do and the ship controls fantastically. The one drawback is turning speed; the manoeuvrability of the larger ships is very slow and can make tight turns laborious. Combat on the other hand is snappy and fast and only hindered by turning speed. But since a lot of your turrets autofire you feel like a god when your ship can decimate everything in its path on its own and when finally you bring the broadsides to bear its goodnight to whomever you are aiming at.\n\nThe ships themselves are fully customizable. From engines to weapons, turrets to warp drives, even the size of your cargo hold, everything can be modified, changed and improved. Starting with the most basic of equipment you soon build a ship Mal Reynolds would be proud to call his own. From the tiniest corvette all the way to the mightiest of destroyers each has its own quirks and I enjoyed playing all of them.\n\nThis game is phenomenal and will have you enraptured for hours. Some people may feel it’s a little slow to begin with or the combat is a little tricky with slow aiming, but if you can get past all that it’s a real gem and I had a whale of a time with it. Plus at full price it is still cheap I would recommend buying this all day any day sale or no.\n\nHave Fun ^_^","December 10, 2015","true","76.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Everything from the theme down to the actual gameplay. I love the music and the look and feel of the game. Really captures that same theme that things like Firefly managed to capture.\n\nMy main concern when going into this game was knowing that it didnt have full free range 3d movement. You are basically a boat, on a 2d ocean that spans in all directions. (ie: you cant go up or down like in most space sims). Shortly after playing though I realized something. You arent a space pilot in some action game. You are more like a bridge commander. Piloting and combat are more akin to something from the startrek films than being seating in the pilot seat of an X-wing.  Does this work? Yes, it does. Quite well in fact. I quickly stopped caring that I didnt have full 3d range of movement, and found myself just enjoying the "flow" of the game.\n\nThe music is great btw, really helps bring the game to life.\n\nCombat is quick, and very "Edge of your seat" once you get past the first couple of tutorial battles. Sometimes you have to run. The game doesnt scale stuff to your level, and you often find yourself in over your head. Escape is a viable tactic and meant to be part of the gameplay. Dont worry though, you wont find yourself running often unless you go charging head first into some space pirate zone.\n\nThe game actually has a LOT more depth to it than I expected it to. The further I played, the more features I discovered. Its so much more than just a funky space combat simulation game. I personally cant wait to play more, and really start diving in to what the game has to offer. Its got me hooked.\n\nMy only real gripe is how there isnt an option to pull the camera back some during broadside combat. I feel a bit "boxed in", which really hinders my combat awareness of things around me. You can find youself crashing head first into things during broadside combat because your field of view is so limited due to how close you are zoomed in to your ship. They really need to add an option to configure the distance you want the camera to be at, or add a toggle that works similar to the camera view distance in a car racing game.\n\nThe other nice feature that easily goes over looked, is how well this game performs. No performance issues, no GPU or CPU load issues. Overall its a well optomized game. (it could use a few higher quality textures here and there though)\n\nSo... overall...\n\nDo you like space games?\nDo you like star trek style combat between big ships?\nDo you enjoy the backwater, wasteland themed style of Firefly?\n\nIf so, I highly recommend this game.\n","October 21, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Rebel Galaxy is a game set in space were you fight intense enemies while controlling and maintaining your ship,shields,armor, and weapons. It starts out very simple and even helpes you along in understanding everything while also getting you right into the combat and interesting story line. No spoilers from me :o! But with it being under 20$!? And a game that can have you playing for many hours at a time while enjoying every minute of it. I'm telling you now. If you enjoy space, battles of many different types of enemies, and the every so often rescue of someone in trouble or even killing both of them and taking the loot then you must try this game. Best way i say the game is like is an EVE that wont make you pay monthly to play and one where you still have a life since you dont have to spend days or even months to get the ship you want.

Sure, other games has the long arm of the law chase you around, have you be loathed by the locals, and generally make life less than pleasant as it should be. So, what was missing? The soundtrack. This is hands down one in the top 20 game soundtracks I have had the pleasure of listening to while I played a game.\n\nAs for the game itself, it is pretty straightforward. Take missions, get credits, earn/lose reputation, and along the way solve the mystery of what happened to your Aunt. While it can get grindy, especially for those wanting to be outlaws and getting that initial "bad reputation" you need, there is a fair amount of variety to the missions, as well as stuff to find, kill, mine, trade, etc. You can also customize your ship in a plethora of ways, from weapons and armor, to ship class itself. From gunship to dreadnought, there's a ship for just about everyone.\n\nCombat is pretty straightforward, you use devastating broadsides on larger ships to tear them apart, while using your turrets to add to the carnage, or use them to pop pesky fighters. With the customized loadouts, you can make your ship a straight up brawler, or make it a long range ship that deals damage from afar without having to worry about heavy plating. There are also support abilities that can further refine your battle plan, or round out a particular weakness.\n\nThe map is pretty expansive, and the economy reacts to events, so raiding a convoy or breaking a siege will also affect prices of goods that can be traded. This affords you the player lots of ways to play, from being a miner to a no guts no glory pirate.\n\nMy only gripes are that it can get grindy, but I really don't mind. The soundtrack and visuals clearly make the downtime less unpleasant, and the long warps around the map have given me lots of places to visit along the way. For someone that enjoys being a space privateer, Rebel Galaxy is a game I am glad that I did not miss out on.","October 20, 2015","true","5.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is definetly worth its price, for 20 bucks you get 20+ hours of fun, far better than a cinema!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe gameplay is simple, but if you got the vibe of it, it's hard to stop playing. It's not a space-sim, but a more arcade-ish game with a very strong atmosphere. catchy soundtrack (which you can extend/replace with your own music from your hard drive if it's not your style), Beatiful skyboxes, plenty and mesmerizing explosions, laser projectiels and engine trails.\n\nThe combat is really fun, you have to position well so you can fire with your main weapons on the side of the ship. It might be a bit challenging first but as soon as you learn the tricks and how to sail in the blins spot of the other ships, it becomes much easier, but stays as fun as in the begining. there is no better feeling when you destroy a ship 3-4 times bigger than yours on your own.\n\nThe controls are made for controlers mainly, and many people say that keyboard+mouse is bad, but personally i had no problem with it, only when you aim with the turrets, the camera can stick to strange places, but it doesn't matter as they will be on auto fire 80% of the time, while you ahndle the broadside guns.\n\nThe story mission is a bit short and simple, and sadly many characters get only a little screen time. But the dialoges are really well written. Overall if you rush the game it can be finished pretty quickly(possible evein in 5-10 hours, but if you fiddle around it can last up to 25-30 hours! it took me around 20 hours to finish the main story [while i did plenty of sandbox stuff] and other 3 hours to get tthe best stuff in the game.), but even if you get the best weapons and defensises on your favorit ship, the combat is still fun and you can spend a hour easily to blast some poor souls into the space.\n\n","October 24, 2015","true","30.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is the first space game I never touch Pandora in, the music is perfect for the combat and for the moment.\n\n2- The variation of ships for a game at this price point makes me wonder why its not more expensive. To me this game's value would have to be set at 39.99 or 49.99. I have seen games at a 60 dollar price point that has less content and less hours of gameplay than this. Everything from frigates to Dreadnoughts are in the game with unique and epic designs to be found in each one.\n\n3- The Story for me is actually interesting, without making any spoilers, I am very interested to see whats next. While doing these missions it reminds me of firefly pulling into a space station and checking the mission board for any missions I can make a few credits on. Get some munitions or better weapons.\n\n4- The graphics are quite good, the explosions are beautiful the weapon designs are stunning. Coming from someone who is an avid player for Star Citizen, to say I'm actually quite pleased with the graphics of this game speaks a lot for itself.\n\n5- Some may not see this as a plus, but you cant just get carried away in combat, not paying attention to your shields, not using your deflector shield and rotating your ship can lead to some frustrating moments when you see your ship explode from damage. I got so into the combat that I didn't realize my ship was taking critical damage and suddenly... BOOOOOM SPOOOSH BAWWW.\n\nOnly negative I see for this game is the lack of 3 dimensional movement. However I have played games that don't have a jump function and they are amazing. The guys who developed this game did an astounding job making it, and it is a must have in anyone's game library that even remotely likes space ships.\nmy rating is a 9.5/10","October 25, 2015","true","8.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The fact that I am recommending this means that out of the 95% of released space sim titles I have played to death, Rebel Galaxy manages to stand out a cut above many of them. I am not even a quarterway finished with the main storyline, yet 10 hours in, the amount of content is quite impressive, and makes gameplay enjoyable to say the least.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a third person spaceship simulator. There is no empire building or 4X gameplay involved.\n\nYou primarily fight, trade and explore in Rebel Galaxy, and start off doing the main campaign which you can deviate from at anytime. Of course the campaign has you flying around a little bit to do other things, but fighting is usually involved. Wonderful thing here is though, interactions with NPCs in the campaign and in general allow for non-violent alternatives to do a mission, or, for instance, to handle a pirating attempt or an illegal cargo inspection by system militia.\n\nThere are about a dozen solar systems in Rebel Galaxy, so you are given some wiggle room to move around. Content such as missions, NPC spawns, and solar system events are randomly generated. There is enough variety to keep things from going stale, and as you get farther away from your starting solar system, more content (ships, equipment, guild allegiances) is available to you.\n\nCombat is a bit different in Rebel Galaxy. And your ship's motion is limited to 2D movement only (while fightercraft and the environment objects can have 3D motions and positions). I will seperate this into two parts. Offensive capabilities and Defensive capabilities.\n\nOffensive capabilities\nIncludes 1) A primary weapon 2) A secondary weapon 3) Turret systems 4) Mercenaries 5) Deflectors.\nPrimary weapons can be either pulse laser types or beam laser types. You fire broadsides (i.e from the side) at the enemies on either side. Very powerful, and include a small charging time for an auto-aim accuracy bonus.\nSecondary weapons are either mines or missiles (point & shoot or seeking). Good damage.\nTurret systems can be either pulse or laser types. You can take control of your turret groups (1 at a time only) and fire at enemies in a 360 degree arc. Critical against fightercraft and provide good sustaining damage against larger craft.\nMercenaries are fightercraft/gunships that follow you around for a 1 time fee. They are very durable, are good fodder, and you can only have 1 with you at any time.\nDeflectors are a sort of temporary shield you can activate which absorb damage. You can also ram enemy ships with them to inflict damage.\nDefensive capabilities\nInclude 1) Deflectors 2) Shields 3) Armor 4) Hull 5) Engine boosters\nAs mentioned, Deflectors are temporary shields that asborb damage until you run out of charge, in which case you must wait for them to have charge in order to use them.\nShields are divided into 4 sections that protect your ship (front, port, starboard, aft) from all damage and collisions.\nArmor protects your ship's hull. Damage to armor can damage to ship systems.\nHull is your powercore. If it goes to 0, you die.\nEngine boosters can be used to maneuver weapons fire, outrun missiles, outrun foes, and kite enemies.\nCombat aside, the graphics are very nice and well optimized. Also, the soundtrack is wonderful, it reminds me of Firefly.\n\nAs with any game, there is a bit of a grind involved to gain credits in order to unlock higher tiered ships and equipment. Best way to go about this is doing a bunch of high paying missions (mission payouts generally increase as your overall strength increases) alongside a storyline mission once in a while. Or however you want. Imo the grind doesn't feel like a grind sometimes. It's pretty fun to blow ♥♥♥♥ up.\n\nAll in all, I dig it. Combat is different, not shallow. Plenty of content. Good soundtrack. Solid mechanics.  Decent plot. Way to go Double Damage Games. I hope you keep making titles in this genre!","October 22, 2015","true","19.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The variety of ships, weapons and modules give it enough diversity to keep you playing for that next upgrade but without bombarding you with sheets of complicated stats.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/racetrack0/recommended/290300/","racetrack0","Racetrack0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/racetrack0/","602 products in account","tl;dr: If you loved Freelancer, Starpoint Gemini 2, or any of the 2D/top-down "open world" space combat/mining/trading games, buy this immediately.\n\nI never write reviews, but man, this game. This game hits way out of its weight class. Watch the trailers, listen to the music - the whole soundtrack is that awesome, and they match tracks to gameplay so darn well. The characters, the music, the ships - the whole vibe fits right alongside Firefly or Cowboy Bebop.\n\nBut how about gameplay?\n\nThis game is darn near everything that I loved about Freelancer - open choices about alignment, how you wish to accumulate wealth (with net worth being the best equivalent to RPG "level"), and so many over-the-top, very expensive upgrades available beyond what's needed to "finish" the game that's any space grinder's paradise.\n\nIt only deviates from that mold on three critical points, by order of significance:\n\n1) Combat is dramatically different.  This is not, and does not pretend to be, a dogfighting/piloting simulation. There is nothing that approaches "real" inertia. You have two axes of freedom (yaw and velocity front-to-back), not six. In that respect, think of it like SPAZ or other 2D space games, but with phenomenal graphics. This game is 2.5D, not 3D.\n\nBut it works. Combat is less adrenaline-fueled flips and rolls, and more stately dance of large ships, where positioning far outstrips reflexes - half way between something twitchy like Elite: Dangerous and point-and-click orders of EVE Online. Everything you fly is a "capital ship" and mostly behaves like one. (That's not to say there aren't plenty of size class upgrades - you could double-park your starting ship in the exhaust ports of some of the larger ones.) This plays more like AC: Black Flag's naval battles, in that your biggest (and manually controlled) weapons are mounted broadside, so this is big ships barrelling up side-by-side to blast the hell out of each other.  In an interesting conceit, fighters are given 3D flight capabilities and can fly over and under you, while capital ships (you and AI) are stuck on a 2D field - 3D flight is there, just for the annoying gnats that you don't fly.\n\nSo combat can take a while, and it'll feel dull to the adrenaline junkies, but it's just the right mellow level of exciting for the person who finds RPG combat exciting and laments their survival skills in FPS deathmatches against all the coked-up squirrels who make your reflexes look like dial-up latency. (So... me.)\n\n2) The world is just plain smaller. Systems are bigger, but there's only about a dozen of them. There aren't a whole lot of factions or terribly interesting power dynamics between factions. But you know what? This wasn't a $50 or $60 game. I felt like there was a totally reasonable, if not Freelancer-scale, level of world available to be for the price tag. Should they ever decide to DLC in more content, I'll be first in line: it would be a better game for it, and completely reasonable to come with an additional price tag, given what the base game sells for.\n\n3) No multiplayer (or the accompanying dedicated server). This one's a bummer, as the only thing I like more than this genre is this genre with friends, but that's a big jump in development complexity for a budget title. So it doesn't feel like a glaring omission or a developer shortcoming (and indeed, leaving it out of scope is better than a broken implementation), but I would love to see a Rebel Galaxy 2 with full multiplayer support Freelancer style.\n\nOtherwise, this thing is dreamy. Every time I find an annoyance in this game, it's because the level of graphical polish, voice acting, and audio design fool me into thinking I'm playing a big-budget AAA title. Then I remember the price tag, and I'm again floored how hard this game hits for its budget.","December 31, 2015","true","21.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The fighst needed features like e.x. Take cover behind asteroids to avoid incoming fire from enemy, Take cover behind enemy ships to avoid fire. Maybe features like cloaking (you can detect every ship with a simples can, th game needs a system like world of warships), sideway boosts or big space battles with way more ships but a tactical feature to command and order friendly ships to win battles. (stop the game like the scannermode give us a overview and command features)\n\n- Market system is to simple after a while and it should add new goods if you get to new systems or have individual goods that you can sell in different systems and more economical possibilitys.\n\n- Random events like distress calls or bountys are great but two features get boring pretty fast\n\n- Events on planets have a good impact on the econemy features but some events don't effect the prices as much as they should in my opinion.\n\n- Rewards for e.x. destroying big battleships or pirate kings are inconsistent and don't scale properly\n\n- And last but not least my most important complain:\n\nThe missions are too similar and there are only a handful of Story missions. The pretext of the Mainstory is good but it feels like the WHOLE CAMPAIGN should be only the FIRST CHAPTER of the whole story unfolding. Everything feels impersonal. You are traveling space for years and you have interaction with 4 notacible Characters in the whole game if you count all mercenarys as one character of interest.\n\nI'm aware that this is a fairly small project from a very small developer team but the wasted potential on this game is making my head spin. So for now, as regrettable as it is, I can't wholeheartly recommend for you to buy this game.","October 26, 2015","false","22.1"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","0"

Missions are over scripted and in a way are not realistic.  For example, every time you have do a trade-guild mission to ship some specific cagro from point A to B, you will ALWAYS be intercepted.  There is ALWAYs trouble.   Now if this were the only problem, I could overlook this.  The actual problem is that the REAL trade mission is to actually destroy the guys who intercept you.  Case and point, I took a very lucrative delivery mission that took place in  the same system.  It was rated as HIGH risk.   I figued I could run away.  My mission is to deliver something, not kill things?  RIght?  Oh no, quite wrong.   So I am getting close to the station I need to make my delivery to, and as usual, the trap is sprung and a bunch of ships appear from all directions and they pull you out of "warp".    So what do I do? I escape, I use my after burners and get enough distance and jump back into warp.  I make it like 5 clicks and the same trap happens again.  I do this 2 more times and each time the trap is reset and sprung again which is just terrible game design.  The only solution is to kill the ambush.  All mission types that are not supposed to be directly about combat workout the same way.\n\n2.  You can have missles as weapons, the problem with them is that you do not have a lot of ammo, which makes sense.  However, if you are an NPC, then you have infinite ammo.  I once had a ship that shot waves of missiles the killed my engines.  The didn't do any damage to my ship or shields, but I couldn't move.  It just sat there for like 10 minutes keeping me pinned.  I had to Alt-F4 to recover because if you exit normally, it would save your game and I would have been stuck forever.\n\n3.  No quick save.\n\nOk, enough of the small sutff.  Why did I stop playing this game without finishing the main story?  What is the big thing that is wrong with the game design?\n\nBasically it is repetivie and boring.  Combat is boring.  Flying around in space warping everwhere is boring.  Each star system is randomly generated, but they are all very generic and you can't really tell the difference other than this sone might have a yellow sun and the other one has a blue sun.   There is nothing to explore or find.  Its all the same, everywhere.\n\nNow maybe if you LOVE space games you may get a lot more milage out of it then I did, but after about 20 hours the game felt more like work then fun.","November 1, 2015","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Better crew, better performance?\n\nAll in all, I am 8 hours into the game and JUST traveled to the second system. It's very easy to get lost in just existing in the galaxy without ever chasing the storyline. RG has incredible potential to be one of those games that I just play when I have nothing else to do. I can jump on, do a few missions, and jump off. I can play one character as a law abiding merchant that helps others and keeps their nose clean, and then start another character to join up with pirates and be a menace to the galaxy. There are many missed opportunities (3D galaxy, multiplayer, crews, explorable stations, actual character creation, etc) but there is a lot of room for them to expand on the game in the future. As it stands currently, it is a game I will use as a time filler when I just want to kick back, relax, and enjoy a stress-free gaming experience.","October 28, 2015","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are also some curious design decisions like being unable to access your cargohold/factions list/tactical menu etc while docked.\n\nThere is no RPGesque character development, the only limitation on what ship/equipment you can use seems to be money and to a lesser extent faction.\n\nThe combat in the game is fun. There is a large variety of equipment available to outfit your ship in order to compliment your playstyle. For instance you can gear your ship up for long range sniping, close range, and even fitting special deflector shields in order to cause extra damage ramming into other ships. In general the combat seems very well thought out.\n\nOn the other hand the trading and mining feel a bit lacklustre. Mining, even with the "perfect" mining setup is haphazard and rarely nets you anywhere near the amount of money combat would in the same amount of time. Trading seems too random in that it's very hard to charge what good will be worth more at any given station. I freely admit though I haven't spent a lot of time trading, so it's very possible that if I invested more time in it I'd understand the system more.\n\nI've read complaints about the save system. It's a standard autosave only game, and the autosave only takes place when you dock. This means that if you pick up 3 missions, complete 2 and then die in the 3rd one you'll lose all that progress. However, that's not necessarily a bad thing as you just weigh up the risk and dock if necessary to save.\n\nThe soundtrack in the game is...interesting. I kind of liked it at first, but it becomes very repetitive after a couple of hours. However, using the launcher you can easily add your own music.\n\nIn summary this game is definately worth picking up if you enjoy space action games.","October 30, 2015","true","38.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even worse, sell him some items then destroy him to get them back after being paid. All while trying to maintain a good standing with certain factions.\n\nThe music is top notch. I could listen to it all day and it really sets the scene as a free-lance/cowboy pilot.\nVisually it is also wonderful. While not on the same level as EVE its enjoyable to fly through.\n\nThe combat is unique (in a good way). It is a hybrid between targeting and letting your AI handle the work and manually aiming and shooting. I like this a bit more than the EVE combat system.\n\nThe developers are also on-point. Very active in the community and make promises they can keep.\n\nOverall I would give this game a solid 8 out of 10. Well worth the money for any gamer who likes space action or adventures.\n","November 2, 2015","true","27.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The soundtrack for the game is very relaxing on long journeys, not that the journeys are long to begin with, at least not by the last games mentioned standards and there's no going back and forth to take and complete missions, all you need to do is simply go to a station, pick up a mission and complete it and the money will be automatically rewarded to you without the need for travelling all the way back to the place you picked the mission up from.\n\nHere's a pros and cons list for those who want a more straightforward run down.\nPlease note that I haven't ventured further than the beginning system at the time of this review, these are based on what I've experianced so far.\n\nPROS:\n-Great soundtrack.\n-I can run the game on max settings without lag on a low grade 1GB GPU and a 2.8 dual core CPU\n-Easy to use controls.\n-No back and forth missions (aside from the story missions)\n-Beautiful scenery\n-AI behaviour for turrets and your wingman (should you choose to hire)\n-Accurate mission ratings from very low to very high (go into high and very high ranked missions carefully)\n-Nice balance of strengths and weaknesses between ships and equipment\n\nCONS:\n-Price jump in higher grade ships and equipment is quite large\n-high risk missions (which often involves killing multiple ships) rewards the same amount of credits as some bounties which are much easier.\n-Faction relations don't give much benefit asides from that faction deciding to shoot you or not and allow you to dock at stations.\n-It's hard to manually target anything that you have to pan the camera to target with turrets (or maybe that's just lack of skill on my part)\n-While I do like the intention of the mechanic it can get somewhat annoying when you are pulled out of warp drive by an asteroid field on a regular basis because you couldn't see it coming and are suddenly smack in the middle of it after managing to avoid some asterdoids by pure luck and end up having to manually fly through it before you can go into hyper again.","November 3, 2015","true","46.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itchee/recommended/290300/","itchee","Itchy.de","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itchee/","220 products in account","Summary:\nThis is a nice, action-ladden space opera. Decent presentation, virtually bug-free and quite a lot of fun for many hours.\n\nFurther Info:\nThink of Starpoint Gemini 2 done right. It has nice (albeit cheesy) music, pretty nebulas and explosions and Laser Beams. Like, a lot of beams. And missiles. There are a lot of spaceships that you can customize with different type of weapons to accomodate your game style. Whether you prefer to attack from afar or get in melee (including ramming), there is the right equipment for you.\n\nSo if you like to blow up spaceships of all kinds, this is your game. However, if you like a realistic space sim, stay away from it. There is nothing realistic in Rebel Galaxy. Flight physics are very basic and very forgiving. Space in the game is only 2D, at least for you. There are objects and enemy fighters that can fly above or below you, but you cannot. To me, this is a great design choice. But this means that you will not really do any dog fighting. Instead, combat feels like seaships battling with the sea removed. This impression is supported by the fact that ships in Rebel Galaxy have their most powerful weapons mounted at their sides and not the front.\n\nAnd by the way. While you can mine in this game and trade, you will likely spend most of your time blowing up spaceships. Mainly because mining and trading is very rougly implemented. I guess, if you make a space opera, you have to allow people to mine and trade. Because people expect it to be there. Even if it is boring as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points I would like to mention: the loot system is very basic. There are a few weapons you can only get from destroying other ships, but these are very rare and not really special. So upgrading your ship is mainly done through spending credits you earn through missions. And while the ship customization options are fine, I would have preferred still more options. Like putting extra power into weapons by sacrificing shield strength. Or installing an extra tower while giving up a support module. Also, the story is sort of generic. No big surprises there.\n\nStill, this is another game that revives the space opera genre, which was believed dead long enough. And if you are actually still expecting Star Citizin to be great, this might be a game that shortens the long wait.\n\n8.5/10.","November 5, 2015","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But warn your friends and family that they will be seeing less of you for a while....\n\nIt's a beautifully done space combat/trading/questing game.  You can be a trader, you can be a miner, you can be a pirate, you can be a quester, or most likely you'll find yourself doing a little bit of all of it.  Or a LOT of all of it.\n\nI will suggest playing with a controller...I'm a longtime keyboard and mouse guy and I never use a controller for anything.  Thats a big part of why my Nintendo was gifted to my nephew and my xbox hasnt been plugged in for 2 years, but with this game the controller just feels right and works perfectly.\n\n\nPros:\n*  It looks 3D, but it's mostly a 2D game, so it simplifies the navigation and combat\n*  Its very open.  There is a story line to progress through , but you're free to ignore it, or progress at your own pace\n*  You can fire it up, do a couple of quick quests, and feel like you accomplished something.\n* And then a couple more, and then just one more, and then another one.....and 8 hours later you've played a quick game\n* It autosaves every time you visit a station.  So if your next quest goes horribly wrong, and you die a fiery death, then reload and try again.\n* If an objective is too hard, there are plenty of options to go make a little money, buy some better armor and weapons, and try it again.  Yet somehow it doesnt feel grindy, it's fun.\n* After over 30 hours, I still have the music turned on.  I saw one review call it "Cowboy butt-rock" - I'm not sure if they meant that as a compliment or an insult, but it kind of fits.  Either way, I like it.\n* The one time I had a problem, I posted a question on the support forum and got a response in 15 minutes\n\nCons\n* If you're not a fan of the "Cowboy butt-rock", turn it off.  The game is still worth it.\n* The game is so awesome it will inspire you to take time out to write a review, which takes time away from playing the awesome game.\n* I can't think of any other cons to put here\n* Really, why are you still reading?  Buy the game already\n\n\n","October 28, 2015","true","47.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're dumped into a solar system, with a few planets and maybe ten-ish? stations to visit and get some random missions from. Cool, great, awesome. Did I mention this is only one solar system out of a galaxy?\n\nSure it's in space, the game isn't really going to be absolutely teeming with life or a huge population, but whenever you find a landmark there's usually some miners, pirates, the Militia, or some traders that are around, and it's up to you how to interpret who is friend, who is foe, and who is prey.\n\nCan you be a pirate in this? Absolutely. Can you trade and smuggle illegal materials from different stations? Of course, just be careful of Militia patrols - they're in bigger, and meaner ships than you are to start out with, and they tend to shoot first and ask questions later if you're on the wrong side of the law. And of course you can also play the role of a bounty hunter, chasing after Pirate heads to fuel your bank account and taking up odd jobs to buy a few new guns along the way.\n\nYou can also be a trader, taking supplies from one station, then going and selling them at another station to make a huge profit. There's a news-feed option in there to let you know what the latest prices are for each station, if you're patient enough. Just look out for the pirates. Or, if you're a wuss, you can just be a miner and shred through astroids with mining lasers, selling the metal ore for profit, and running the hell away from the Pirates who like your cargo, but don't like the work.\n\nAs far as the combat goes, there's nothing really all that complex about it. You've got Broadside weapons, Turrets, and Secondaries. Broadsides are pretty self explanitory - they're guns mounted in the port and starboard sides of your ship (Left and Right) that are your main ship-killing weapons. What's neat is you can just spray-and-pray with them if you want, or you can charge them up, take aim, and have a well-timed barrage that leads your target so it lands right into their hull. Although if you're point blank, sometimes the spray-and-pray is better for use as a DPS race.\n\nThen you have turrets. You can have some pretty simple stuff... missile turrets, laser turrets, beam weaponry, and even some flak guns to take down those pesky fighters and bombers swarming around your poopdeck.\n\nAnd lastly there's Secondaries. Secondaries are essentially up to you, and effect certain places where your craft will be effective. You can put... bigger flak guns, you can put mine launchers, dumb-fire missile launchers, heat-seeker missile launchers, and so on.\n\nAs far as the story goes? I haven't really gotten that far into it yet, but from what I can tell it's super simple and not really anything that you're gonna get lost on. Find some alien-tech doohickey and then go on an adventure to find out what the heck it is and what it does.\n\nBottom line is this: If you like Starpoint Gemini, but thought the combat and world was exceptionally boring (like I found it to be...)? You'll like this. If you like pretending you're piloting Serenity or the Outlaw Star, you'll like this.\n\nYou can't take the sky from me.","November 22, 2015","true","38.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Trade/fight/upgrade... Pretty much the same basic gameplay you'd get with any space ship science fiction game. The game pulls off the gameplay really well but brings nothing new to the table.\n\nDefinitely worth a buy, however the dev's really need to be more creative.","October 21, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game can get repetitve but the core conecepts are fun enough to have anyone coming back for more. As an added note since I've seen some reviewers upset by the concept of the game: the game takes place in 3D space but you are fixed to a 2D plane, while this may sound lame for a space shooter it still feels like a lot of fun in its execution.","October 20, 2015","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a single player space adventure with naval style combat, complete with broadside attacks. Upgrade your weapons, shields and more or save up to buy a whole new ship - anything from a nippy little corvette to a huge and powerful dreadnought.\n\n[PROS]\n* The soundtrack is immense. It's sort of bluesy and grungy, with a definite western feel (think Firefly). The heavy guitar riffs brought a smile to my face more than once during a pitched battle.\n* The story. Engaging and fun, with just the right amount of grinding side-quests in between.\n* Active developers. The game is post-launch, but they're still working on it and perfecting things, which is always nice to see.\n* The graphics. The ships are very detailed in perticular, with artistic and individual designs for each one. None of the 'stock blocky ship 1a' nonsense you get in some games of this ilk. They all have their own distinc look and feel.\n* Firefly. A lot has been made of the similarities and they are there. Mostly in the asthetic rather than the actual gameplay, but it really feels like that's the universe you are playing in. What's not to love about that!\n* Freedom. Choose to stay in a fast ship with high maneuverability, or spring for a lumbering dreadnought, armed to the teeth. Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, steers like a cow. There really is no perfect choice. You can switch between ships you have bought with no penalty too, which is a great touch.\n\n[CONS]\n* Campaign could be longer. A mid-level ship is more than sufficient to complete the whole thing, so the awesome but expensive top-tier ships don't get a proper airing. However  The campaign ends on a cliff-hanger, so a sequel or expansion might be in the works.\n* Navigating can get a bit irritating. You drop out of FTL travel when you get close to an asteroid, or any other obstacle and they are everywhere. This would be okay, but you can never see them coming in advance. I got used to it though, since travel times really aren't that long anyway.\n","October 24, 2015","true","22.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I find, by the time I get to precise targeting, the battle is over.\n* No crew or ship boarding. No hijacking of other ships.\n* It feels empty at times... I have a HUGE ship. Where are my crew? Better crew, better performance?\n\nAll in all, I am 8 hours into the game and JUST traveled to the second system. It's very easy to get lost in just existing in the galaxy without ever chasing the storyline. RG has incredible potential to be one of those games that I just play when I have nothing else to do. I can jump on, do a few missions, and jump off. I can play one character as a law abiding merchant that helps others and keeps their nose clean, and then start another character to join up with pirates and be a menace to the galaxy. There are many missed opportunities (3D galaxy, multiplayer, crews, explorable stations, actual character creation, etc) but there is a lot of room for them to expand on the game in the future.

My laptop has a hard time running it though.\n\nGreat pacing, lots of things to do; explore the solar systems, smuggle cargo between space stations, start fights with space pirates and steal their cargo, sell loot and upgrade your weapons...buy a new ship once you've saved up enough.\n\nI also like how you can customize your ship to fit different playstyles, there's no wrong answer, combat always feels intense and rewarding. Outfit long range cannons and missles to snipe opponents from afar, for medium range fightfights use blaster turrets and rockets, or cover your ship in lasers to cut ships apart up close!\n\nYou also get to pick whether you prefer a huge tank-like ship or a sleek corvette, customize your speed and durability based on your play style.\n\nThere are no levels, the more money you make the better ships and equipment you can afford, so buy trade items low, stock your hold with valuables, and sell to the buyers offering the most at the commodity markets at the space stations.\n\nOne other thing I love is the music. Not only does it come with great music by default, you can use your own MP3 collection, and it will change songs for Ambient, Combat, Idle, Menu, and Space Station. So I made folders for each music type, copied songs that fit the mood into the folders, and added those folders to the game's music library. So when I'm cruising through space I can enjoy some low key Beck and Radiohead, but when a fight breaks out the game will start blasting Green Day or the Klaxons!\n\nBuy it!

The game takes place on a flat plane, which means no z-axis navigation. You're solely on the X-Y Plane. And that's a good thing, once you see the competition you're up against. But don't worry, only the smaller craft go up and down, the larger ones don't. You can individually man a selection of turrets or your broadsides in combat. There's a variety of each type to choose to suit your playstyle. If you like to get up close and personal, or keep your distance, there's a weapon for you. When you are not controlling the turrets directly, they are controlled by the AI, which you can configure. You can set them to lock onto specific targets, fire at will, or be completely manual. It's up to you. Even navigation is largely the same as Black Flag. Accelerate in stages, decelerate in stages with optional braking, and turn from side to side.\n\nAside from that, there's things like factions you can side with, an economy to exploit, mining activities, and so on. A story is present, but can go largely ignored. Feel free to blow ♥♥♥♥ up and rack up the credits to the next ship upgrade. Speaking of, aside from aforementioned weaponry, defenses such as shields and armor and subsystems, which run specialised tasks as additions to your ship, can be upgraded. In a refreshing change of norm, you don't lose any credits when buying and selling items for your ship, so you're free to experiment until you find something that works. Even the ships you purchase come in a variety of sizes, from meek little frigates to massive and lumbering dreadnaughts and destroyers. There's plenty of ways to find a loadout more to your playstyle.\n\nOne complaint I often see in space games is the sheer lack of things to do between travels. Fortunately, Rebel Galaxy keeps you on your toes. What may seem like a routine flight to another station may result in attending to a distress signal, getting ambushed by the enemy, or crashing into a nebula, with rocks (sorry, unsure what it's actually called) to dodge, mine or destroy. You can't expect to set your target and make some tea.\n\nThere's also significant strategy in taking down opponents. Firing at the left side of the ship reduces the shielding for that side only, and not all the way round. Same goes for armor. So do you take an all-sides approach, or focus on one side of the ship? It's not so easy to just fire away, as you need to consider these things when attacking.\n\nShould you wish to make some dough, you can take on side missions or perform things like trading, mining, bounty hunting, and so on. It shouldn't be too hard to get the credits required for your next purchase.\n\nGraphics-\nI'm not one to stress on how pretty a game looks. I'm more for graphics. But my oh my is this game pretty. I'm more the person who feels Mirror's Edge looks better than Crysis 3, and the same goes here. Not the Crysis 3 thing. Space is beautiful. Instead of making it a black cosmos, with little white dots, it's colourful. Distant nebulae pepper the view with dashes of red, green, blue, purple, etc. Ships look worn but strong. Damage modelling is pretty impressive. ou can see scorch marks and chunks missing, embers glowing with some of the inner components revealed if you suffer significant damage. Weapons look beautiful when fired. They glow brightly, be it lasers or missiles. Speaking of, there's a flare effect from oncoming missiles fired from afar. Gives it a very cinematic feeling. There's also enough lens flare to make JJ Abrams happy, but it's done tastefully. Rest assured you won't have your view blocked by it. The UI is clean and uncluttered, letting you really soak in the surroundings. Rocket trails, when at warp, leave long blue lines behind you, and they each have a different layout depending on the thrusters of your ship. The Pulse effect looks good, akin to sonar visualised. When braking your ship, the thrusters turn red, as though they were brake lights. I considered it a nice touch.\n\nSound-\nBest soundtrack so far. The game comes with a preloaded country/western soundtrack, that actually fits really well with the game. Should it not be your thing, feel free to add your own music collection, with the ability to set specific folders to different moments in the game, ie Combat, Travel, and so on. I personally set some dubstep for combat. As for sound effects, they're powerful. Flak cannons properly deafen, missiles have their own distinct sound, and everything comes together without sounding deafening. Even the AI which reports on your ship's status is plucked straight outta Sci-Fi stereotype, but hey, it works! Voice acting for the other characters you meet along the way is decent, but some of the quips from your enemies will begin to repeat fairly early.There's variety in language too. Different species may speak different languages, but in a way that sounds realistic. All in all, pretty good.\n\nConclusion: The game gets repetitive, sure, so its longevity  really depends on how much fun you can have. I personally see this as the kind of game I can invest quite some time it, but your mileage may vary.","January 19","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This game came out of no where from me, and if not for a reccomendation from someone I trust I would have never even heard of it. This is a game by a series of devs that know their stuff. The controls are very slick and accessible, the ship piloting is fantastic, and it's the kind of thing that could have had a waffly, generic scifi electronica or trumpet track and instead has some of the most radical rock/country (yes, I am advocating something that is at least in part country, but I mean listen to the trailer people) I've ever heard backing it pretty solidly. That tangles with the interesting strategies for space battles, the system for navigating faction trust and how you can play out numerous missions without even touching the main story. This is an excellent example of emergent gameplay and, while the story to me is really just so much background noise, even the little things characters do and say add to the setting's charm. This is AAA+ to me, amazing and simply made me a fan of this dev in whatever they do.","January 4","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So if you feel like taking a break from all of the Multiplayer space games (Eve online, Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, ect.....) this is the game for you. This game is a simplified, single player version of Elite Dangerous. Also the graphics for such a small game are quite AMAZING!!!!

How many games are there that have you flying around space, buying, selling, mining or stealing? I have played quite a few over the years. Most of them have you moving around in 3 dimensions; after all, space is not flat plane is it? So, why does Rebel Galaxy use two dimensions for you as the player but 3 for many of your opponents? Surely this is silly?\n\nSurprisingly I have to say no, it actually works really well. I am around 4 hours into the game now and I must say that I like the battle mechanics and the flight from one part of the system to another is pretty smooth. (Could be a bit quicker possibly but that is just me.\n\nSo, what is it that I enjoy? Raking your opponent from stem to stern using broadsides in space is cool. This is why the game is on a flat plane. By using your main weapons as broadsides it would not work if you had to roll to bring your guns to bear.\n\nThe ecomomic system seems to work well, I like the way that when buying or selling you can see the average price in the sector. This will reduce the need for notes or trying to remember how much you paid for nuts and bolts, yes this is a real cargo. I like the idea of cola being illegal btw :-)\n\nI think that this is one that I will be playing for some time. It has been on my wish list since its release and in the sale I thought I would go for it. Now, the big question is would I have still enjoyed it at full price? So far I have to say yes I would have. There are loads of missions to do, a storyline to follow or if you just want to blow up asteroids for ore you can. There are loads floating round.\n\nYou can configure your weaponry easily, with plenty of ships to fly , I haven't seen any dodgy models yet, all looking rather swish.\n\nSo, go and buy the game if you like flying in space, blowing things up, mining or finding lost relatives. You won't regret it.\n\nShould have said about the music. Cant think of ANY game that has more fitting music!","February 7","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a fun combat focused game. the brodside style is great but can make it a little challenging in the belts with all the rocks you can run into while looking to the side. The voice acting is ok and sounds like your dealing with folk living in the backside of creation, does remind one alittle of Firefly.\n\nThat said the game feels a little flat for an open world style game. Some things are missing that other open world games have, ie the Elder Scrolls series.\n\nOther than the main story line there is nothing to do except the mission boards and get credits for your next upgrade. You can join the guilds but the only reason to is for the gear that only they have. There should be guild specific storylines, as in other open world games, with thier own consequences and rewards (not just creds but uniqe gear as well) to make it worth your time to join.\n\nI enjoy playing this game. But would like to see some DLC's or mod's come out to fix these little flaws. All in all thumbs up.","January 23","true","130.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being a Former EVE Online player, and multitude of other games I got in my own collection, The controls for this is very simple... for I will admit, I am no pilot! I am the only person in the world whom can crash an aircraft on takeoff!\n\nBut the controls are easy, and I love it.\n\nOkay so here are the pros that I can safely say: for one, 19 bucks for the game is a bargin compared to other games, such as Elite: Dangerious (I tried it, cant fly), I like the trade system in the game, cause lets face it... repairs can suck at times, and drains the living hell out of your coffers. It doesnt hurt to dabble in it afterall, suppliment your income to ensure your vessle is in combat shape? why not right?\nAnother is the combat system, The turrets, the Turrets! Oh how wonderful it is to be able to set the turrets how you wish. Leaving you to focus on defence, Sub Weapon systems (EMP Flak for the win), and the broadsides! while the turrets can rip the little fighters apart (they suck at times). the Manuvering is very smooth if your comfortable with the standard Keymotions from MMOs, you know the ASDW.\n\nOkay, time for the Nitpicking;\n\nthe Cons;\n\nShip content; I was told by a Dev (Thank you by the way) They will adjust ships to better suit how each is to stack up, so no one size fits all vessle... But still, we could use more ship types. even have Fighter Crafts of our own, even Bombers (For you batshit crazy aces out there, you know who you are), And maybe JUST Maybe, look into adding Multiplayer content, like conversion option for Single or Online version. Some people wanna rub other peoples faces into their afterburners afterall, and some are lone wolves in a sense.\n\nMercinaries: Well not really judging, but would be nice if there was more of them to choose from, its like... each part of the space you go to, its sometimes the same pilot sitting at the bar (Stalker much?), So be kinda nice to have to hunt down your fav merc, and make them worthwhile to hang onto (rather than rehire them later in the game just to keep up with the enemies in the area)\n\nFactions: Needs a hint more love, maybe more factions?, and of course adding stuff for the factions to do (stuff that can affect each galaxy?) So Devs if your reading this and not vomiting from my pretty sad review. Take a moment from giving yourselves a far well deserved pat on the back, and look into Factions. Then Add and Fluff (and polish them out), it would give you ALOT more stuff to do, and would (hopefully) get alot more people to buy it\n\nSo all and all in a Nutshell (if your still sane after reading this, grats, if not... I heard the Jello in the institutes is nice),\n\nThe Game is great with next to no complaints, great soundtrack (be better if you can change the channel at times), Good content, and player control. I highly recommend getting this game...\n\nOh by the by, for you new players out there... hire a merc, they are a real help!\n\n\n-----Spoiler alert!-----\n\nTHE CAKE IS A LIE!!","February 3","true","35.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

As far as a single player space simulator this is by far my favorite. You are not limited to just fighting all the time you can MINE and TRADE as well!!!! So if you feel like taking a break from all of the Multiplayer space games (Eve online, Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, ect.....) this is the game for you. This game is a simplified, single player version of Elite Dangerous. Also the graphics for such a small game are quite AMAZING!!!! They show hull damage significantly better than most space games out right now. So in short great game probably gonna put in an easy 100 hours into it.

How many games are there that have you flying around space, buying, selling, mining or stealing? I have played quite a few over the years. Most of them have you moving around in 3 dimensions; after all, space is not flat plane is it? So, why does Rebel Galaxy use two dimensions for you as the player but 3 for many of your opponents? Surely this is silly?\n\nSurprisingly I have to say no, it actually works really well. I am around 4 hours into the game now and I must say that I like the battle mechanics and the flight from one part of the system to another is pretty smooth. (Could be a bit quicker possibly but that is just me.\n\nSo, what is it that I enjoy? Raking your opponent from stem to stern using broadsides in space is cool. This is why the game is on a flat plane. By using your main weapons as broadsides it would not work if you had to roll to bring your guns to bear.\n\nThe ecomomic system seems to work well, I like the way that when buying or selling you can see the average price in the sector. This will reduce the need for notes or trying to remember how much you paid for nuts and bolts, yes this is a real cargo. I like the idea of cola being illegal btw :-)\n\nI think that this is one that I will be playing for some time. It has been on my wish list since its release and in the sale I thought I would go for it. Now, the big question is would I have still enjoyed it at full price? So far I have to say yes I would have. There are loads of missions to do, a storyline to follow or if you just want to blow up asteroids for ore you can. There are loads floating round.\n\nYou can configure your weaponry easily, with plenty of ships to fly , I haven't seen any dodgy models yet, all looking rather swish.\n\nSo, go and buy the game if you like flying in space, blowing things up, mining or finding lost relatives. You won't regret it.\n\nShould have said about the music. Cant think of ANY game that has more fitting music!","February 7","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And in the grand scheme of things? I've barely scratched the surface of this game. You're dumped into a solar system, with a few planets and maybe ten-ish? stations to visit and get some random missions from. Cool, great, awesome. Did I mention this is only one solar system out of a galaxy?\n\nSure it's in space, the game isn't really going to be absolutely teeming with life or a huge population, but whenever you find a landmark there's usually some miners, pirates, the Militia, or some traders that are around, and it's up to you how to interpret who is friend, who is foe, and who is prey.\n\nCan you be a pirate in this? Absolutely. Can you trade and smuggle illegal materials from different stations? Of course, just be careful of Militia patrols - they're in bigger, and meaner ships than you are to start out with, and they tend to shoot first and ask questions later if you're on the wrong side of the law. And of course you can also play the role of a bounty hunter, chasing after Pirate heads to fuel your bank account and taking up odd jobs to buy a few new guns along the way.\n\nYou can also be a trader, taking supplies from one station, then going and selling them at another station to make a huge profit. There's a news-feed option in there to let you know what the latest prices are for each station, if you're patient enough. Just look out for the pirates. Or, if you're a wuss, you can just be a miner and shred through astroids with mining lasers, selling the metal ore for profit, and running the hell away from the Pirates who like your cargo, but don't like the work.\n\nAs far as the combat goes, there's nothing really all that complex about it. You've got Broadside weapons, Turrets, and Secondaries. Broadsides are pretty self explanitory - they're guns mounted in the port and starboard sides of your ship (Left and Right) that are your main ship-killing weapons. What's neat is you can just spray-and-pray with them if you want, or you can charge them up, take aim, and have a well-timed barrage that leads your target so it lands right into their hull. Although if you're point blank, sometimes the spray-and-pray is better for use as a DPS race.\n\nThen you have turrets. You can have some pretty simple stuff... missile turrets, laser turrets, beam weaponry, and even some flak guns to take down those pesky fighters and bombers swarming around your poopdeck.\n\nAnd lastly there's Secondaries. Secondaries are essentially up to you, and effect certain places where your craft will be effective. You can put... bigger flak guns, you can put mine launchers, dumb-fire missile launchers, heat-seeker missile launchers, and so on.\n\nAs far as the story goes? I haven't really gotten that far into it yet, but from what I can tell it's super simple and not really anything that you're gonna get lost on. Find some alien-tech doohickey and then go on an adventure to find out what the heck it is and what it does.\n\nBottom line is this: If you like Starpoint Gemini, but thought the combat and world was exceptionally boring (like I found it to be...)? You'll like this. If you like pretending you're piloting Serenity or the Outlaw Star, you'll like this.\n\nYou can't take the sky from me.","November 22, 2015","true","38.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game page and other reviews do a good job of providing more detail on the gameplay, so I won't waste too much time covering that.  Basically, it's a naval combat game in space (movement is in 2D only).  That being said, this style in no way detracts from the game's value.  You spend your time doing missions, mining, trading, and/or hunting bounties to make money which goes toward upgrading your ship.  There is also a "main campaign" that takes you through a simple yet adequately interesting story.  On the downside, the factions are a bit bland (as is mentioned in several other reviews) and there really doesn't seem to be much replayability (at least I personally have no desire to replay now that I've beaten the game).\n\nIf you want to pew-pew other spaceships in a beautifully rendered, decent sized "universe" while listening to an admittedly catchy soundtrack (seemingly ranging in influence from CCR to Pearl Jam at times) then this game is worth looking into.  It runs smoothly with no bugs or glitches (for me, anyway).  Ultimately, I found the game experience to be well worth the cost.\n\n8.5/10","February 3","true","45.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Spend more than five minutes in the game and you'll be wishing you were raiding Space Trains belonging to Space Yankees who sacked the Space South after Sherman's Jump through the Orion Spur.\n\nGraphicly it is a decently impressive game that doesn't really fail to impress when it concerns ship, station or other object design and detail... also love burning up in atmospheres of planetary bodies, so gotta watch that hahah... seriously don't fly too close or you'll melt yourself six ways from STS-107.\n\nOverall if you want to jump into something that'll suck you in for a couple dozen hours its well worth the purchase for the sound track alone, which you can stand alone play from the game's data files (if you have anything that converts .ogg format)","February 16","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found that a fast frigate could out do a powerful, lumbering dreadknoght with speed and manuverability, or that using your ship's suppior broadside's range could keep you out of harms way.\n\n*The economy is dynamic and interesting but not overly complicated "cough cough X!" and scoping out trade roughts in the games massive, proceduraly generated universe was alot of fun.\n\n*The style was another big draw with it's awesome southern rock/blues/country soundtrack and it's wild west, bad-side of town vibe. Not to mention, the ship models are fantastic!\n\n*The game also has alot of choice for missions and encounters. Do you help the pirates take down the merchant for a haul of loot, or do you take a stand and protect the merchant to increase your reputation with the citizens?\n\n*And finnaly, the devs are great. They're helpful and dedicated and constantly patching the game and listening to the community\n\nIn the end, Rebel Galaxy is a terrific, deep space, swashbuckling adventure sure to keep you flyin' for along time.","October 25, 2015","true","57.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As usual you start with an underequipped ship and earn money for better weapons/systems, new ships, and even mercenary support if you want it. You can earn money via missions (randomly generated and storyline), trading, mining, piracy or bounty hunting; it's up to you if you want to stay the right side of the law or if you aim to misbehave. It's worth noting that your starting ship is a corvette and the ship classes only get bigger from there on (right up to massive dreadnoughts). Because you're always commanding a large ship, combat is very different from a fighter-focused space sim and as others have pointed out it the 2D movement gives a 'naval battle in space' feel to it (though faster paced); it actually works pretty well, making the battles very fun to play - which is a good thing, because there is a lot of combat in this game.\n\nVisually this has a beautiful-looking universe, some spectular space battles and a wide variety of nice ship designs (from Serenity-style rustbuckets to more conventional-looking starships). I like the fact that the different ships cater to different playstyles -  bigger isn't necessarily better as there are other factors like speed, manouverabilty and weapon placement, so instead of a linear progression to the 'best' ship, people will find their own favorite ships along the way.\n\nThere are some aspects of the game that could do with some improvement such as the scaling of encounters and missions - the actual difficulty of missions doesn't always seem to match the stated risk level. Also it's quite possible to get into fights where the only chance of survival is to run, especially at the beginning of the game; though this is not a bad thing in itself, the fact that the game pops up a combat tutorial note on your first fight (even if you're totally outmatched) could confuse new players into thinking they should always be able to win their first battle. I can see why the single checkpoint-type save is controversial, but personally I'm fine with a single save AS LONG AS there is some backup in case of corrupt saves - fortunately haven't had a corrupted save yet, but would be pretty peeved if this happened after hours of play.\n\nThe slide-guitar soundtrack does help create that 'wild frontier' Firefly vibe, but it also starts to get a bit old after about 10 hours - fortunately there is an option to stream your own music - looks like a cool idea, but haven't tested it yet myself.\n\nOverall this is probably the most enjoyable space game I've played since Freelancer.","June 3","true","20.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hours of play go by without me noticing, but every time something annoys - combat mechanics, navigation, etc.\n\nThe good:\n\nRight out of the gate, you can do stuff.  You’re not limping around with crappy, starter equipment very long. The first couple missions are just challenging enough, and give you a decent reward to do some upgrades.  There’s no dishonor in running away from fights until you get good enough equipment to fight back.\n\nIt’s really is immersive, and I love that you can play your own custom soundtrack which enhances that. I haven’t done much with the main story yet, having too much fun tooling around the galaxy doing side missions and exploring stuff.\n\nEquipment upgrades don’t depreciate, so you can sell them back for the same as the purchase price.  This is great when you’re starting out and just figuring out the game mechanics.  It eliminates those costly newbie mistakes that handicap you as you advance.\n\nThe annoying:\n\nSome of the mechanics clunky.  For example: When mining, you blow up the asteroid then have to go hunting for what pops out using the pulse feature, boost your way to the loot (being careful not to overshoot it), then painstakingly angle into the sweet spot that will auto trigger your tractor beam. I’d really like to be able to target stuff manually and then grab it.\n\nI have to agree with other reviews about the lack of Y axis. It is really frustrating, particularly in a big firefight when you have a swarm of nimble enemy fighters attacking you at all angles, disappearing along the vertical just as you go to nail them and all you can do swing from side to side, waiting for them to get back to the horizontal\n\nDifficulty ratings are a crap shoot as far as accuracy.

Even though you can skip the story completely it guarantees you at least 20 hours of gameplay just to finish the story mode, thus the ships and upgrades you can work your way to buy.\n\nAs many other "space sims" out there you can spend time mining, trading, doing mercenary work and questing. It's all about finding what's best for you. There are ships to fit your needs and you can always improve them. Reminds me a lot of Endless Sky and Freelancer but with better graphics and fancy effects.\n\nThe soundtrack leaves me speechless and the game gives you the ability to add your own songs into the soundtrack so you can listen to your own music while playing.\n\nRealism is not the main factor here but this game sure is really fun! 10/10, waiting for a faction revamp DLC.","January 1","true","7.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It looks attractive, and it gets the job done, but it has some glaring faults and limitations and can burn like hell going down.\n\nOne of the often mentioned features is the sound track, I thought it was pretty cool at first, but after 2 hours I turned down  the music to 10%.  It certainly sets the mood, and establishes Rebel Galaxy as a "Firefly inspired" space western.  however it gets repetative, and is intrusive.  After you hear the title song five or six times in a row blasting in your ears, it gets old quick.\n\nI am susceptable to ear worms, and it's going to take a few days to get this out of my brain completely.   That isn't a good thing for me.\n\nIt's not that the songs are bad, by no means, the artist who wrote them is talented, and I like the sound track.  But too much of a good thing can be frustratingly iritating.\n\nOther reviewers have done a good job talking about the games features and gameplay style.   comparing it to the ship combat from black flag, and I think that is a spot on comparison.   It really feels like someone wrote a naval combat engine, and halfway through decided to make it a space game instead.  This could literally have been a WWII naval simulator or something and it would have been the same game.   Just with water and islands instead of space and planets.\n\nTo put it bluntly, this is an Naval combat arcade game with a space skin.  Despite this, the game works, it works stylistically, and the gameplay is satisfying enough to keep you playing.\n\nThe game is only 20$ full price (I got it for 13$ on sale), and it's worth even full price, but only if you like the genre.\n\nBuy this game if:\n\nYou like the Vibe of Firefly or Serenity.\nLike Arcade shooters in space.\nLiked the naval combat of Black flag.\nLike the standard Trader/Bountyhunter/Pirate/miner kind of space game, and don't mind the emphasis being on combat.\nLike the gritty southern/blues/country soundtrack.\nLike the graphics.\nDon't mind being locked into a 2d playing field, even when smaller ships can still fly 3d.  All around you.\nWant to control a whole ship using even just a console controller (works very well).\nYou Like Single Player games.\n\nDon't buy the game if:\n\nYou strongly prefer Simulators/realism to arcade style games.\nYou prefer complex controls, and tactics (you can pretty much phone in tactics in this game).\nYou are tired of the Trade/fight/mine paradigm of space sandbox gaming.\nYou hate any form of country music.\nYou Hated Firefly.\nYou expect a long complex story with tons of twists and turns (I like it so far, and the voice acting and dialogue trees are fun... but it's not Mass Effect for example.).\nThink a "2d limited" space game is too immersion breaking.\nPrefer multiplayer.\n\nFinal verdict:  If you like the genre, or can get past the burning in your throat, you will enjoy this offering.  It is a good game to unwind with, the fights satisfying the visuals pleasing.\n\nLike that cheap shot of whisky, it may not have the smooth quality of a higher priced drink, but it will still do the job, and if you drink enough of it, you won't even notice the burning in your throat anymore.\n\nUnlike that shot of whisky, this shouldn't give you a hangover, and won't ruin your marraige.\n\nAnyway, I have no regrets, it's a fun game, worth the full price unless you fall in the "don't buy it" category. ).","February 7","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can aim your guns up and down, but your ship will only steer left and right; you're flying what amount to capital ships in this game, so its not completely ridiculous logic I suppose, if nothing else it makes aiming your main broadside cannons easier. You can give the AI control over all the rest of your armaments, or you can swap to them manually at any point.  I prefer to let the AI eat away at the small fighters and crap while I focus my roflstomper on the big armored ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with giant guns. Because it needs roflstomped. Repeatedly.\n\nSecond, random asteroids and space debris knock you out of warp.  That's really annyoing because then you have to realign for warp which means moving around the random object you got hung on which is time consuming and it happens frequently; it should be more like Eve, where you do have to align and accelerate into warp speed proper but once your ship begins warp, it passes through solid objects from asteroids to planets. Its a small thing but it gets old really, really fast. There are upgrades for the warp drive but they increase warpspeed rather than improve your align time or reduce the amount of time needed to align; I would much have preferred the latter and just have maximum warp speed determined by ship class, again like in Eve.\n\nI beat the story, unlocked all the achievements (legitimately) and still find myself doing stuff in it for short stretches of time, I really enjoyed it.\n\nProbably not what you're looking for if you're a fan of either of the games referenced in the beginning though, at the very least if you come into this game looking for one of those games you'll be disappointed; I didn't know what to expect, and I like it!","March 20","true","36.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/steamscape/recommended/290300/","steamscape","nannerpuss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/steamscape/","139 products in account","Edited and update review here. I wanted to re-review this after seeing how good/bad the game was after you finish the story. I had a very strong positive reaction to my first 15 hours playing, but after you finish the majority of the main story mode, the game is basically over. It wasn't built for a "sandbox" experience or anything, as the systems get less and less fun as you move along the main story path. I'll explain that more below, but if you want a one sentence recap: good game, worth twenty bucks for sure, but it has a few glaring problems.\n\nFirst off, I really like this game. Almost every aspect is fun and it isn't often you get good space games on Steam. The price is good, and I do recommend it overall.\n\nWith that said, there are some major flaws. The first one being the trade and economy system. It's so poorly handled that it's hard to justify it being in the game at all. The only time you will find the market scheme useful in any way is very early in the game, in the first or second systems when you are stuggling to earn credits. The work it takes to get goods and then find the station that is buying high is just way too hard to justify when you start earning $100,000 per mission - let alone when you are getting $1mil per mission later on. The 90k you might make off trading is insignificant. Your time spent grows significantly and the gains never justify it. The whole thing could have been alleviated by having actual up-to-date pricing information available both on the main map and while in a dock, but the developers failed miserably on that. It's true they did implement a (very minimal) scheme that shows you current pricing in each station from the main map, but it only works if you've already visited the station or happen find a message transponder that gives you the information. Even then, the information is only good for a matter of minutes. The game will randomly change the goods and prices in each station, so usually by the time you get enough of the goods to matter, you will never find the right place to sell it unless you get really lucky and accidentally stop at the right station. Couple that with random events like famine, celebration, tech boom, etc., it's like a lottery except the profit is meaningless. There is no logic or reason to the system, no attempt to mimic actual markets in any logical way. The one and only way to make real credits is by doing missions, which are fine and fun, but I think they should have either cut the entire trading system or made it universal and simplified. Instead it's like they started out with a good idea, but lost it halfway through.\n\nThe other huge issue is the "proximity stop" system. Basically, if you come within a certain distance of any other object in the game, you will be instantly halted out of warp. This would be fine and make sense if they tried to limit the amount of debris and roaming hostile fleets, but as the game progresses and you meet more factions, the maps stay the same size. So what you end up with are huge fields of debris from battles needing to share a shrinking amount of space with asteroid fields and huge fleets of enemies wandering around. By the fifth system or so, there are a half dozen factions on each map. Then you have merchants and traders randomly criss-crossing the place on top of it, and they have their own bodyguards with fighter ships. It all adds up to way, way too much crap on the map and fewer and fewer routes you can take just to do simple tasks, like going to turn in a mission or finish a trade.  After the 100th time you get stopped mid-warp just because a piece of debris or friendly merchant came within 400 sm (in-game unit of measurement) of your path, it gets incredibly frustrating.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the "escort" missions are mostly broken at present. They might patch them again, but right now only about 75% of them work as intended. The pathing is poorly coded and there are too many random objects that only confuse the AI even more. Occasionally you will get a big piece of ship debris and it will cause the AI's ship you are escorting to start moving forwards and backwards, over and over, in a loop. You can abandon missions at any time, so when it does break, it's easy enough to just forget it and move on.\n\nSo, those are my main frustrations. Otherwise this is a great game and is easily the best space game on Steam right now. It's definitely better than Elite Dangerous, plus it's only twenty bucks. I got this on sale for $13, and for that price, it's a major bargain. If you are looking for trade simulation or a long-term sandbox mode you can play in after the (approximately) 25 hour storymode is over, this might not be the best game for that. I got over 30 hours out of it and that was definitely worth $20 to me, but your mileage may vary.","January 2","true","39.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In combination with the incredible music giving every fight you take a Wild West spin; you truly are on the lawless outskirts of space.\n\nYou start with nothing and climb all the way to the top in any way you want. Trader, Miner, Mercenary, Pirate. Just be careful who you make enemies with, anything goes in this game.\n\nOn the subject of trading, Rebel Galaxy contains a simple yet effective trading system with market values that will change in response to local events. Discover trade routes from station to station, capitalise on resource shortages, a station currently being blockaded will be in desperate need of supplies.\n\nWhen you feel strong enough, use a jump gate to travel to one of the many other systems. Make sure you are prepared though; higher risk brings higher reward but you won’t be smiling facing a Dreadnought class ship armed to the teeth.\n\nThis game stands out as one of its quirks is that it is locked on a 2D plane, honestly I think this brings its benefits. You're at the helm of a capital ship, you wouldn't be doing amazing tricks. It also simplifies the controls, meaning you can focus less on keeping the ship level and more on the actual fight.\n\nJust listen to the soundtrack, it completes this game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBAYW0WGKtE&index=1&list=PLvJV9BRNJsmVdv17rkxzUuy6jdB7oQXch","February 5","true","38.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But at some point something clicked  and i began to really like it.Its broadside based,  you can aslo control turrets.\n5- The graphics are nice, and i ahvent run into many bugs (i think i crashed once)\n\nIf you are past Privateer/Elite/Freelancer fan, i think you should enjoy it very much, tough i recommend wathing vids to see the unusual ship control/combat in action.","November 13, 2015","true","17.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Don\'t expect tonnes of hours unless you force yourself to drag the game out.\n\nFun. Really fun - I couldn\'t put it down for the irst few days (then I beat the story and stopped caring because I had the best ship and gear, period)\n\nEqually proffitable to trade or fight your way up (I got lucky abnd kept finding clouds of things called \"face of gozu\" so my fight-intended gameplay did turn to occasional crude mining to leap forward in the game FAST)\n\nAll of the exact flippin\' same mechanics from Starpoint Gemini, meaning the whole game takes place on a two-dimensional plane... in space...\n\nCONS:\nWell I honestly hate how much like the first Starpoint Gemini it is. It\'s often distracting, and I had PTSD-like flashbacks of the most horrible russian voice acting you could possibly imagine...\n\nThe story is... terribad. I didn\'t care... I just COULD NOT care about anything that was happening and everyone and their dog all looked like either targets or speed-bumps in my pursuit to be come the biggest, baddest mo-fo in space.\nOnly need one possible conversation choice ever: \"Get behind me, meat-pop, and watch how it\'s done.\"\ni didn\'t even get interested until, I kid you not, the very very end where the AI you are hauling around starts to actually BE a flippin CHARACTER present in the nearly non-existant plot line.\n\nNot enough ships.\n\nAfter the storyine ends, if you have the biggest and best like I did by that time, the game becomes quite literally - pointless. When you DO reach that point, you are so OP, no fleet generated to fight you can take you down unless you get jumped while taking an afk dump.\n\nComparing this to Freelancer is a huge insult to freelancer and Chris Roberts - whoever does that owes Mr. Roberts an apology. Freelancer is a benchmark standard in space-traders/space-sandboxes... and this DOES NOT meet par with Freelancer on any grounds of reasoning.\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD BUY: Because when you get rid of the slimy hype that would otherwise leave you dissappointed in not getting what was so highly promised in praise - it\'s a kick ♥♥♥ space trader that lets you roam around in a rather large sandbox and blow the crap out of nearly everything in sight.\nIt\'s very simplistic and very easy to learn and master, and is also controller compatable - though KBM is best for this game.\n\nOverall I give it 7/10 - best to wait and get it when it\'s on sale. Cheap.","May 31","true","29.0"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","1"

Small scope, not fantasy, but a better role-playing experience. Because face it: trying to role play in Skyrim is just silly. What I found in Rebel Galaxy was a refreshing change of pace with no commitments.\n\nExperience:\nStarting out it really reminded me of Privateer crossed with Earth & Beyond. Loved the former and wanted to love the latter. I tried to role play (I wanted to be a bloodthirsty pirate) but the pirates weren't welcoming and money was tight so I went with Merchant and Mercenary after my first save game corrupted. For a little while I tried to get into the "events" and trading but the simple math of the game finally proved itself out. Upgrade, upgrade, upgrade. Kill, kill, kill. Mission, mission, mission. Click through the conversation trees because nothing they're saying matters a bit. Oh, final mission done.\n\nThe music is really good at first - setting your mind in the "Firefly" wild west mentality. Then it gets a little repetitive. Rather like the same 6-8 talking heads. I never got bored enough to switch to custom music and I did find myself humming some of the tunes at work.\n\nGameplay:\nFor a few hours the non-combat mechanics are worth exploring. Mine some asteroids. Jump from station to station moving commodities. Shop the mercenaries. Experience the array of 6-8 mission types. It didn't take long to get a handle on deciding what's worth it in risk vs. reward - factoring in time, of course. These mechanics quickly lose relevance.\n\nCombat mechanics are pretty simple. Load your ship with the best turrets you can (in a variety that suits you), a broadside that you can maneuver well enough to bring to bear, and over-level your shields and hull first. Roll into the fight and sweep them if you can. Run away if you can't.\n\nOne small gripe is the extremely shallow pool that is the ship customization. The hull I was in never really seemed special (it's just ports, turrets, and cargo space). And I felt just as effective in my tier-6 armed Destroyer as I was in my tier-6 armed Dreadnaught. But, with the system as simple as it was, I enjoyed not needing a spreadsheet or helper tool to deck out my ride.\n\nAnd my big gripe that kills this game for replayability: no choices. I ran a straight line from beginning to end with some grinding (a lot, really, in the early game). No impact. No changes. The galaxy just rolls along without the events making any real impact or change. The story is alright but predictable. I was relieved when I saw the end of it.\n\nOne and done. Worth the $20 I dropped on it. No replayability but the once-through was fun.","January 3","true","45.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Although it is quite enjoyable, it has several major flaws.\nAlthough I played the game for 20+ hours, the game story line is extremely short and only last this long because of the grind required to progress. The game feels a little bit like a free to play where you are constantly gated and required to upgrade your ship, weapon and defenses before being able to progress.\nHere are my opinions on the game.\n\nPros:\nEnjoyable combat system\nInteresting story\nNice progression system\nGood music\nCombat SFX are very good\n\nCons:\nVery limited character voices\nOnly 1 portrait per race\nRadio static communication SFX is terrible\nStory is extremely short\nGame requires a lot of grinding\nVery very limited choices on actions and discussion\nMerchant and mercenary guild discussions are extremely plain, the progression of ranks do not unlock anything discussion wise.\n\nI have mixed opinions on these:\nYou can finish the game with MK5 gear with ease.\nMK6 is just bonus to farm for which will remove any challenge from the game\n\n\nIn the end, I loved playing rebel galaxy, and I streongly recommend it. I personally bought the game when it was 33% off.\nIf you enjoy these types of space games, do get it. Its just a shame that the game had soo much potential and ended up being so much less than it could have been.","January 3","true","25.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Add to it some hearty music and Rebel Galaxy feels warm and alive, unlike its much more expensive predecessors.\n\nThe main gameplay feature that sets this space sim apart from all others is that the battle happens with Black Flag type naval combat, where the ship stays on a flat plain and fires cannons from the sides. While the system does work, part of what I love about space sims so much is the freedom to fly anywhere and by restricting the movement to a plain, you are cutting at the core of what is interesting about space sims.\n\nBeyond that, it is a fairly standard space sim with some trading, a central plot, side missions, ship upgrades, etc.\n\nMy main issue with the game at the moment is its saving behavior. At the time of this review, the game saves whenever you quit the game and there is only one save. This means 2 things: 1. you cannot load a previous game if you mess up and 2. if anything happens to your save, you are screwed. This means you can't really have fun and experiment because the results of your experiments are on your permanent record. Dear developers, please add a normal save game feature.","November 8, 2015","true","39.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(i.e. if there's a Militia Embargo on an outpost, bring it military style products for a nice profit)\nThe ships are interesting and specialized. You feel accomplished when you get the next awesome ship and throw some killer components on it.\nComputer requirements are well within reach for most PC gamers.\n^>It feels very optimized and lag is infrequent.\nThe graphics aren't comparable to BF4 but, it's a very pretty game.\nThe story, though not entirely compelling at first, is well written as are the characters for their minimalistic impact on the game.\nThere's been ZERO glitching. That's just fantastic.\n\nCons:\nDifficulty may seem overwhelming at first but, you'll quickly understand the importance of picking your battles and what upgrades are needed. Until you learn to broadside properly, high-range turrets will be your best friend.\nI can't really think of any others at the moment. I've been having a really good time. :)\n\nSuggestions:\nCo-op Play would be EPIC in larger scale confrontations.\nWhen on the Commodity Window make a sortable LIST of the other outposts you've visited and their pricing instead of the slow "here's the price at this location" rotation. I've spent far too much time just sitting in my chair waiting for the outpost i want to see prices for pop up without having to go back into space and look at it on my map.\nThe distance between the sides of your ship and stellar masses when trying to warp is too great. Front space is wonderful but, if i can turn my Radovich completely sideways and not hit what made my warp stop that's a problem.\n\nAlso, a question to the Devs;\nDid a few members of your team REALLY enjoy "Armada" for the Dreamcast? Because this feels like what that game should have been. I loved that game when it came out and put far too much time into it and this feels heavily influenced by it.\n\n\nComp specs:\nAMD FX-6300 OC'd to 4.5GHz\nRadeon R9 280 OC'd to 280x specs\nUltra setting, Full Screen, 1080p = 140FPS most of the time.","October 22, 2015","true","97.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

It's combat mechanics are normal, yes, but they still feel new. If your playing on a mouse and keyboard, I highly recomend that you get some sort of controller. Trust me, the game gets at least 80% better with the smooth movements of a controller's anolog sticks.\n\nOther aspects of epicness include its BADASS style. the graphics, gameplay, and ESPECIALLY music compliment this games similarity to Firefly. The only difference being that there are aliens, its rock type music instead of pure country, and the combat is space based, as opposed to firefly's ground based combat.\n\nSpeaking of music, it's amazing. It may have been made before this game came out, but its almost as if it was MADE for this thing. (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSkh6g5ksvc ) Its a mix of western country, and hard rock, and it practically is a music album that comes packaged with a game.\n\nAll in all, 9/10, minus one because I havent gotten too far into it yet, but so far so good.

Add to it some hearty music and Rebel Galaxy feels warm and alive, unlike its much more expensive predecessors.\n\nThe main gameplay feature that sets this space sim apart from all others is that the battle happens with Black Flag type naval combat, where the ship stays on a flat plain and fires cannons from the sides. While the system does work, part of what I love about space sims so much is the freedom to fly anywhere and by restricting the movement to a plain, you are cutting at the core of what is interesting about space sims.\n\nBeyond that, it is a fairly standard space sim with some trading, a central plot, side missions, ship upgrades, etc.\n\nMy main issue with the game at the moment is its saving behavior. At the time of this review, the game saves whenever you quit the game and there is only one save. This means 2 things: 1. you cannot load a previous game if you mess up and 2. if anything happens to your save, you are screwed. This means you can't really have fun and experiment because the results of your experiments are on your permanent record.

Small scope, not fantasy, but a better role-playing experience. Because face it: trying to role play in Skyrim is just silly. What I found in Rebel Galaxy was a refreshing change of pace with no commitments.\n\nExperience:\nStarting out it really reminded me of Privateer crossed with Earth & Beyond. Loved the former and wanted to love the latter. I tried to role play (I wanted to be a bloodthirsty pirate) but the pirates weren't welcoming and money was tight so I went with Merchant and Mercenary after my first save game corrupted. For a little while I tried to get into the "events" and trading but the simple math of the game finally proved itself out. Upgrade, upgrade, upgrade. Kill, kill, kill. Mission, mission, mission. Click through the conversation trees because nothing they're saying matters a bit. Oh, final mission done.\n\nThe music is really good at first - setting your mind in the "Firefly" wild west mentality. Then it gets a little repetitive. Rather like the same 6-8 talking heads. I never got bored enough to switch to custom music and I did find myself humming some of the tunes at work.\n\nGameplay:\nFor a few hours the non-combat mechanics are worth exploring. Mine some asteroids. Jump from station to station moving commodities. Shop the mercenaries. Experience the array of 6-8 mission types. It didn't take long to get a handle on deciding what's worth it in risk vs. reward - factoring in time, of course. These mechanics quickly lose relevance.\n\nCombat mechanics are pretty simple. Load your ship with the best turrets you can (in a variety that suits you), a broadside that you can maneuver well enough to bring to bear, and over-level your shields and hull first. Roll into the fight and sweep them if you can. Run away if you can't.\n\nOne small gripe is the extremely shallow pool that is the ship customization. The hull I was in never really seemed special (it's just ports, turrets, and cargo space). And I felt just as effective in my tier-6 armed Destroyer as I was in my tier-6 armed Dreadnaught. But, with the system as simple as it was, I enjoyed not needing a spreadsheet or helper tool to deck out my ride.\n\nAnd my big gripe that kills this game for replayability: no choices. I ran a straight line from beginning to end with some grinding (a lot, really, in the early game). No impact. No changes. The galaxy just rolls along without the events making any real impact or change. The story is alright but predictable. I was relieved when I saw the end of it.\n\nOne and done. Worth the $20 I dropped on it. No replayability but the once-through was fun.","January 3","true","45.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Oh yeah, I am totally now a space pirate!\n\nController support is well implemented and I don't need to touch my keyboard to play (other than to hit 'play').\n\nJust shy of 2 hours in and barely scratched the surface, but based on what I have seen so far, this game could charge at least double the current price and still be good value.\n\nRecommended.","October 24, 2015","true","13.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

In addition to the main campaign quest, you pretty much go around the galaxy accepting different bounties so that you can upgrade your ship and complete the harder quests in the campaign. Almost all the bounties are combat-type bounties.\n\nYou can also acquire money through trade on the commodities market, but it can be very time-consuming. The key to commodities trading is finding out what outposts will pay the highest for various products. For instance, a scientific oytposts will pay higher for intellectual property and tech stuff, but a rogue or outlaw outposts will pay more for illicit drugs and whatnot. You can also gain trading info by reading news boards and speaking to bartenders. Traveling between space stations and various parts of the galaxy can be boring. It can take several minutes to travel between points on opposite sides of the galaxy.\n\nThe graphics are nice and the music is awesome, but it gets a little monotonous after awhile since it plays constantly on a loop throughout the entire game.\n\nThe combat is interesting. It is "naval-style" combat, which means your primary guns fire from the side. This imposes a significant learning curve to combat since you have to fight sideways, which makes it harder to see incoming missiles. There are secondary weapons that you can switch to that don't require sideways combat, but then you have to constantly adjust your ship angle if you switch weapons a lot. It is challenging but rewarding when you finally get it all down.\n\nRebel Galaxy is a fun and nice alternative to most space sims that require a lot of management and alliance building over a long period of time. Rebel Galaxy commences with all that by giving you a campaign and a ship. The rest is up to you.","April 12","true","15.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But from the trailer it looked like it would be an absolute wild ride.\n\nIt is.\n\nI don't know what pulled me in more: The incredible soundtrack, which while somewhat short, never ever got old and always pumped me up for taking on a whole enemy flotilla single-handedly while being completely out-classed and out-gunned. Or the visuals which are stunning from the very beginning.\n\nThis game has hit a perfect spot of being scifi and western: a playable Firefly. It keeps you enthralled even after you finish the story. The developers really hit spot on on the idea of purely enjoyable gameplay. It's not complex and convoluted. It's not necessarily simple either. you have to think about how you approach your enemy. What weapons are best, do you go with massive firepower or shield and hull strength? A middle ground? How can a small cruiser take on a dreadnought 5 times it's size without getting obliterated?\n\nThere are a couple pseudo-downsides, other than the (epic) short soundtrack,\n\nThe first somewhat downside to this game is that because it's their first one (as far as i can tell), they weren't able to make it bigger, or the story longer. There isn't much character development, however they put a LOT of thought into what was there, such as if you listen to the alien languages, you can actually pick up what words mean what in the translations. I'm a language nerd and that scored MAJOR points for me.\n\nThe other downside is that you have to get used to it not being a 'realistic' space game, since you are playing on a flat plane, you cannot do spins or attack from above or below as you would imagine being able to in theoretical 'real' space combat.\nBut the gameplay is so fun that, at least for myself, i completely discarded that particular misgiving and simply had fun with it.\n\nThis is quite honestly one of the best games i've played in YEARS, i can't recommend it more.","March 22","true","52.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The first few hours of game was quite disappointing as the 2D flight mode and the lukeworm story can hardly convince me that this game is even comparable to freelancer. After 5 hours, however, the game became a little more interesting as weapons and ships are unlocked and some of the missions are quite interesting. I have to admit the graphics are good, not superb, but comparable to the freelance --- a shame on its own as the freelancer was a game almost two decades old. The combat system was not inspiring but acceptable and admittedly quite fun to play. Just as I thought the game is getting better, it quickly revealed to me that this is no more than a freelancer game in its core repacked with better graphics and a toned down 2D flight mode. The game soon degenerates into a struggling effort to complete repetitive missions to gain enough money to upgrade ships and components that are ridiculously expensive and are so for no other apparent reasons than to compel the player to complete those stupid missions. So far I think it is unrealistic to make enough money to buy any of those higher level weapons and ships with trade alone. The difficulty associated with some of these missions are also questionable as some missions would see you quickly swarmed by a horde of overpowered enemies ships while other missions give ridiculously high reward for the simpler tasks.\n\nIn conclusions, I believe this is a game suitable, in fact I would use the word ideal, for killing your excessive pastime at a moderate price. However, to comment that this game may even aspire to be of the equal to freelancer is a severe overstatement.","June 5","false","32.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I want to love it. The soundtrack makes you feel like a space cowboy right at the main menu. The designs manage to sell you on this gritty space society without feeling messy or cluttered. The gameplay premiss seems like a fresh twist on a working concept... and here things fall apart.\n\nIt has an interesting idea of broadside combat in a freelancer type space sim, but it fails to achieve either. Whatever there is to master in this game is mastered in under an hour, and it basically comes down to "have bigger guns and better shields". Any fancy manouvers will only give the enemy time to recharge their shields or let them turn their undamaged sides towards you. Just fly up and hammer them harder while your turrets autoshoot any fighters. After that you just repeat the same interactions over and over to earn cash towards upgrades that add +stat% . You can feel safe taking any mission that has a danger rating you've dealt with before, because they scale with you and nothing ever changes.\n\nEven more dissapointing is the fact that there is virtually no point or reason to fight or do missions as it's slow and tedious, forcing you to cover large distances of empty space. Just find the trade route that is currently most profitable per minute and fly it back and forth until it drains to make atleast 10x in an hour what you could have gotten from missions during the same time. This way you'll never make enemies either!\n\nAlso, dont buy anything but cargo or cargospace boosts. ♥♥♥♥ is super expensive and serves no point. You basically don't have to fight ever if your goal is to become the biggest bad ♥♥♥ in space. Some light shields and an engine will do fine! Any investments in your ship will just take money away from buying up expensive cargo. Then, when you made all the money there is to make from trade runs where you interact with absolutely no one... buy the most expensive ♥♥♥♥ you can find. Voila! You are now the best at this game and nothing can hurt you!\n\nThe best part? Maybe you got a bit eager and there was more money to be made? Bigger ships to be found? Better guns? And now all you trading captial is gone? NO PROBLEM! Just sell all your ship parts AT COST and become a peacful trader again.\n\nYou could just do this at any point when you wanted to actually kill something.

I was blessed enough to receive a key for free eventhough I will buy multiple copies of this for my family/friends. Just being upfront about it but I played in the beta and pre-release so my review is coming from all my experience with the game. Now onto the review.\n\nEver since the rlease of Freelancer on PC way back in 2000, I have been aching for a new space sim experience. If your like me and also have that itch then look no further. This game has pirating/trading/looting/mining/space battles.... a whole slew of things you can do in the sandbox that they have created for you.\n\nThere are several systems or galaxies in which you traverse and have jump gates to connect them. Each system has its own factions with which to either befriend or destroy. You have a main story but also space stations with side missions along with the included Trading/Mining/Mercenary guilds which also provide missions. These three factions also provide unique ships, weapons, shields, and other things to outfit your ship. The combat is likened to naval style (think Assassins Creed Black Flag ship battles) and its set on a 2d plane.\n\nThe art style, ship design, space backdrops are all top notch. The audio is also one thing that is a step above. The soundtrack alone warrants a look at this game. It gives the feel of a space fairing outlaw lol. Think Firefly, Han Solo, Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star vibe. The sounds of the weapons firing gives a sense of real power and gurth behind each barrage launched from your broadside cannons. The best sound to me is when your FTL drive spools up and then hits warp.\n\nThis game has been on my radar for some time now as my top 5 most anticipated games of 2015. I knew that Travis and Erich who left Runic Games to establish Double Damage wouldn't let me down. If you have any interest, what are you waiting for help these two Devs out by purchasing this amazing experience! I know I will be purchasing copies for my friends and family and for only 20$ US you can't beat that deal. The price for value is one of the best of 2015 alone. Do your self a favor and play it.","October 20, 2015","true","54.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Right from the get-go the menu does not use the mouse (it has some in-game menu use, but it is very buggy)...obvious console port. Overall I would say just wait for a sale or don't buy it at all.\n\nGunplay: 4/10\n\nIt is very annoying to shoot enemies with your broadside cannons because they lock on to targets, so you are not really aiming. Same with the turret and missiles. Sometimes the aiming redicle will lock up when trying to aim due to it trying to stick on to a different enemy. The gunplay just isn't fun.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\n\nThe game looks nice, but at first glance it seems much older than 2015. Still, good or bad graphics don't determine a game's quality.\n\nStory: 7/10\n\nThe story line is neat, but right from the start it gets predictable. Also, most missions are "Hey, you! Go run over there and shoot something for me, thanks." You go do the mission, return, and then do it all over again. Also, all stations are the same (not externally or main characters, but the generic character models and interior is all the same).","April 27","false","0.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Rebel Galaxy is a swashbuckling space adventure, with action-packed combat, exploration, discovery, trade, and “negotiation” with the outlandish denizens at the edge of the known universe.\n\nAs the commander of an immensely powerful star destroyer, you’ll battle pirates, explore anomalies, befriend aliens, scavenge battle wreckage, mine asteroids, and discover artifacts. Choose your path as a roguish do-gooder, crafty space-trader or power-hungry privateer – or maybe a little of each! Buy larger and more powerful craft with your hard-earned credits, and outfit them with a variety of wicked weapons and defenses. Set in a galaxy of fantastic sights, and secrets to be found, Rebel Galaxy is above all a space epic of adventure, exploration, and combat.\n\nThe edge of the universe is a pretty dangerous place, so watch your back. - Highly Recommended!","December 3, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Compared to other space titles around at the time, Elite, Star Citizen, Star Conflict, No Man's Sky, and a host of others surfacing and submerging, this game stands out first to me the fact that it's single player. Shock horror. If you can get over that, it's fantastic.\nI can't stress enough what a masterpiece the devs have done as far as software goes. Produced in a ridiculously short time, by the guys that brought us diablo, and then torchlight. Install's 2Gb, and run's so smooth even on a low end laptop. Has controller support, also (personally i love the controller controls on this title, well thought out, the commands are simple enough to just get stuck in). The controls overall aren't gratuitously complex. There aren't as many menus to cycle through as other games, and this doesn't feel like a bad thing, or that you're missing things. The combat is great fun. Winning or losing, it just FEELS good, with an awesome soundtrack to accompany it. Basically, in my view, while i enjoy say, elite, for a long term, "sim", this is arcade. It's pick up and play, blast a few minutes out and achieve something. It doesn't have so much replayability for me personally, but for the 1 playthrough alone, it was worth every penny. While writing this i genuinely am getting a hankering to play it again some time, so, i guess it has some replayability factor afterall. I'm not sure what else is important in a review.... it's smooth as hell to play, bug free (i'm aware that of course there'll be bugs these days in most titles, but i haven't found any thing i'd call a bug. The forums are well maintained and there's few bug reports from people with competant brain cells, if any, that haven't been addressed and long fixed. There will always be a vocal few that want to run across a open room in a shooter, towards an enemy sniper, head on, without jinking, get shot in the head, and complain that the sniper rifle is OP, and game breaking. Welcome to the internet. It's bug free, fun to play, great soundtrack, cheap game even when not on offer, looks great on not so great machines.\nCons? Can't play with friends.

Especially for $10-20.","May 31","true","18.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you've ever played Tachyon: The Fringe, you're going to love this game.\n\nI know that quite a few might be turned away due to the thing's lack of vertical flight. Put simply, the lack of a vertical axis isn't a drawback - it's a feature. The kind of ships you'll be in charge of, you won't need a vertical axis.\n\nI'll list out the good stuff and the bad. Hopefully that'll help.\n\nThe Good:-\n1) Low-cost title that plays like a AAA game.\n2) Fast-paced and simple to learn.\n3) Quirky in many aspects.\n4) Great soundtrack, with an obvious inspiration from Firefly.\n5) Very nice ship design, and a used-up feel that's surprisingly cozy.\n\nThe Neutral:-\n1) Star-systems aren't particularly unique, but the graphical detail and insanity offsets that to quite some extent.\n2) Trading and Mining are viable alternatives to a kill-em-all blitz, but it can be boring or tedious after a point.\n3) Fairly interesting characters, but their full potential was never realised.\n4) Cash is something weird - either so much that you don't know what to do, or too little, resulting in you getting outgunned.\n5) Mercenaries are a nice touch, but again - like the main characters - not realised to their full potential.\n\nThe Bad:-\n1) Some missions can be hilariously broken, and tougher than they look, which can cause hair-pulling at times.\n2) Rather short single-player campaign.\n3) Can be slightly boring after a certain point, though not too bad.\n4) No further development on this title, it would seem. Hopefully there'll be more on this after some time.\n\nDefinitely give it a try. You won't regret it!","December 21, 2015","true","24.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Great gameplay, great sound, great graphics.\n\nMy wishes:\nJust wish the dev could add visual personalisation, and perhaps see physical growth to your ship other than just adding turrets, perhaps even colour changes or skins. Multiplayer ala diable style would be great too. like 2-3 allies fighting of smaler waves, until the big boss arrives, and these provide unique drops.","October 21, 2015","true","32.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I had a review of this up earlier complaining about it and a dev told me to make sure the correct card was being used which i did, and it still is...bleh. Somebody said it might have a data leak, so if that was fixed and it was optimized a bit, that might help.\n3) The turret.

More adventure than Elite Dangerous and easier to jump into for a quick session.  Many aspects of the game are similar to Elite Dangerous, but in RG you only move in two demensions instead of all three.  But the 2 dimensions of movement is implemented in a way that doesn't leave me missing the 3rd dimension.  A bit more arcade than a space simulator, but you don't have to worry about dealing with the real-size of space and how long it takes to navigate it as you do in Elite D.

Combat takes place on capital ships, so don't expect to be pulling off sweet manuevres or Luke in the Death Star trench stuff. The whole premise of the game is that you're looking for pieces of a puzzle first introduced by your enigmatic aunt, along the way you undertake missions and ♥♥♥♥ off all the pirates in the sector to the point you can't dock anywhere any more. I came to this off the back of Elite Dangerous, and have been completely satisfied. High risk missions pay more money (hauling huge munitions cargos into the middle of a siege is immensly rewarding), and you have full freedom to do whatever you want and explore the galaxy. Combat is usually pretty fluid, though learning to balance your weapons and deflectors takes a little practice, and the broadside based combat may not be everyone's cup of tea.","April 6","true","19.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you enjoyed the naval combat in Assasin's Creed: Black Flag, get ready for that exact same experience except with better music and laser beams.\n\nPro's:\nExcellent soundtrack and if you get tired of it, the game makes it really easy to swap in your own at start up.\n\nCombat is simple, but can be challenging at times depending what sort of mess you fly into.\n\nThe ship design is interesting and the different weight classes make each class pilot differently enough to keep them distinct. That said, it'd be nice to have a few more ships to choose from or mod support so we can make our own.\n\nCon's:\nEventually the whole game gets repetitive. The music repeats after a bit, the systems start to look the same with the only real difference being the color of the core and the enemies are more or less interchangeable as far as faction goes.\n\nCharacters are forgettable and the story won't suck you in, but for $20 bucks you knew there was going to be a trade off and the narrative is it.\n\nIf you can't wait to play Star Citizen and Elite:Dangerous seems to complicated and in depth or requires too much patience, than this might be your cup of tea. You could do worse for $20 dollars (20 tacos at taco bell?). If you catch it on sale for $10 or less, I'd say go for it without reservation, at full price you might want to ask yourself what else that $20 could buy you.\n\nIf the game ever gets mod support then buy it without hesitation and see what kind of hijinks you can get up to.","January 4","true","12.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I havent even left the first galaxy yet...hopefully there will be expansions as things go along. In the mean time there is plenty to do...trade, smuggle get into MANY fights. Upgrade your ship, get a new one...visit strange new places and interact with alien races... Some will be disatisfied there is not the depth of a sim...it DOES lean towards the arcade side...still...that to me isn't a huge deal. There are plenty of in depthe starship simmulations.

Battleship combat in Space witha variety of weapons and enemys. Solving Missions as Mercenary for hire or Merchant or whatever.\n\nThe game IS fun, at least in the first 15 to 19 hours. Thus i still would recommed this game, even for it's full price.\n\n\n\nHowever, after 19 hours the gameplay really runs thin on me and is still the same as it was at the beginning, just with a little bit different and statistically better weapons.\nIf there is more variety further in then that iks bad because after 19 hours the game should have put on it's best gameplay pants.\n\nOverall it doesn't really do variation that well.\n\nThese are the reasons why i coulödn't keep going any more.\n\nEquipment/Upgrades are more or less superlinear:\n\nThere is no sense in choosing a weaker weapon because you perhabs like the look or how it's mechanic works, if it's of a lower damage and a shorter range then what you actually can get you won't bother because of it's downsides.\nThis counts for every aspect of the upgrades, everything is rather a linear upgrade because the best things to get will be (numerical as well as trough testing them) only the best Broadsides, Turrets, Shields and so on.\n\nOn top of the the lack of variation also comes from the game having not enough actually usefull or rewarding... well rewards. drops of items or weapons. In my 19 hours with the game it dropped maybe 5 Items one of wich i then actually took on till i stopped playing because it was just the best. Or at least i think it were drops because the game sure as hell didn't really tell me.\n\nAll the thiongs that the enemys let fall is really boring loot that is also really cumbersome and stupid hard to collect. Because for some reason you can lock on to dropped cargo but if the Tractorbeam just doesn't want to collect the more viable ressource and instead insists on picking up the ♥♥♥♥ Nuts and Bolts then there is nothing you can really do about it aside from collectting the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing drive it elsewhere, throw it into space over there and then come back to repeat the same thing until... NO THANKS after a short while i just didn't bother with most of these drops.\n\nGood equipment and weapons you only get in stations. That is not a bad thing per se but it hurts the gameplay fun. Why don't we have a slvage mechanism where we can salvage broken enemy ships?\n\nSamey and thin Mission/Story:\n\nThe Story is okay. Nothing really to write home about. It gives you a direction to go for but much more then thin context for the mission it ain't. Not even the Main Ones. Every Mission is more or less the same. No matter what the description or story behind the Mission. You go somewhere, bla bla happens, enemys are there or turn up, you shot stuff, perhabs you have to deliver something and that was it. Go there, pewpew, done.\n\nWell, there WAS one mission that was a escort mission. But that was an instant death of mission target thing. Not that i really could have done something against it. Wich incidentally feeds into the next problem.\n\nThe combatsystem is flat:\n\nAnd i don't only say that because in stead of real space you actually just move on a single layer, an invisible "surfeace" in space. That in itselfe i don't mind at all.\n\nThe promisse of the combat system is really interesting at first. You have braoadsides, like a battleship should :-) , and with growing ships you own more and more turrets on top of it. In the Pause menue you can then give the different turrets commands like, only attack fighters , or that rocketturret is only suppossed to shoot at Capital ships. You can also take control over the different turrets youself but that doesn't really make much sense. With increasing Equipment you get the feeling your tactical possibilities grow. But they don't\n\nAside from limiting missille turrets for the bigger ships the best strategy is to give all turrets the commando only to attack what you actually lock in with the trageting system. THIS is thousand times more effective then let different turrets do different tasls.\n\nYou then skirt around the edges of the battlefield picking of the enemys piece by piece because it makes no sense to charge in and do risky stuff. That will just get you killed or addled with immense reparicosts. It doesn't bring you really much to use cover. You can hire ONE additional mercenary but those aren't much more then the turrets you already have. There is nor real strategy to the combat\n\nAnd that is a problem because it is boring as hell. Okay that's a lie, it is fun in the beginning, i wouldn't had spend 19 hours in the game otherwise, and testing the different weapons did that. But in the end it is always the exact same. And that very same lack of real strategy was also was cost me that one Escort Mission.\n\nWith no viable tactics that i could have stopped the different enemys from attacking my charge. There are no weapons that do much beyound damage. There is no REAL variety.\n\nBut instead of hammering on that point i will tell you what i WISHED it had:\n\nFirst off, give me more bigger ships that i can hire with different real gameplay roles (Give me a tank, a repairiship, a ship that can confuse or disrupt(e.g. debuff) enemy systems with AOE Explosions.\n\nLet me give them a strategy and a DIRECT choice of target or missionparameters. Like the repairship´is to reapair (du) us but keep away from capital ships. The tankships is to stay close to me to catch the really heavy incoming fire in my flank. Do the same for the enemys and that would give me an incentive do actually dive into enemy ranks and aim for their specific ships.\n\nDo the same for the weapons. Gve me a variety of functions. How cool would i have been if i could use point defence flak against missilles, streams of bulletts flying away into the sky with a chance that they miss one and some get trough. How about those same guns don't just affect missilles that attack me but an area around me. Or that ramming shield, make that actually DO SOMETHING. Because as far as it stands there is no real gain from ramming your ship into others with it, the name is totally useless in that case.\n\nIn a escort mission i would stay close to my charge together with a Tanking ship and my possibilitys would have been much greater.\n\nIt also would have given far better tools for the overall mission variety just by playing with the enemycombinations.  It would have had the chance of getting me much deeper into the frau riskl something, drive me to the edge and i imagine how i in a last bit for taking down that pesky Carrier how i ram my ship into his and win day...\n\nor something.\n\nAs it stands the game is good for the first ten to fifteen hours or so then it becomes really samey same and uninteresting.\n\nFrom the fact that i unasked loose my ship when i buy a new one over the mission to the weapons and gagdgets it simply lacks the depth to carry me further.\n\nWich is sad because i feel this could be more. Perhabs next time. :-P","March 26","true","19.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I can't be arsed. Then play this instead.\n\nBasically it's like an Indie Freelancer, this would be the closest game you could compare it to. Yes it is not a 'space simulator' but what it does give you is turrets that you can just give targeting orders to... which i think is awesome and a suedo tactical battle if you use the scan function to effectively pause the game and think out a strategy. I have played this game for several hours and have many more hours of gameplay left. Mining is... well mining but it has been done quite well. Battles are fun but it is a bit of a 'I have bigger guns and better shields' fight more than anything.

If you like to wear a long brown jacket and insist that your girlfriend calls you Mal... buy this.\n\nI personally would just plain recommend you buy this!\n\n9/10 - Could be more variation with stations and objects.

An almost Freelancer style game with simple mechanics that make learning quick and fun. The missions you take can be legal or illegal - bounty hunter, merchant, smuggler, miner, thief, and so forth. Combat is satisfying and engaging, though a bit over the top at times and occasionally downright impossible until you have had further equipment upgrades. Once purchased though, the difficulty lowers.\n\nThe commodity system was great! This was one of the most satisfying games for being a merchant I've ever played. Watch for starvation and run them food from an agrarian planet. Take water from one system that is rich in it to a more barren system and earn 200% or more than what you bought it for. Took a little getting use to, and I still don't understand it all, but the overall mechanic is satisfying once you get an idea of it.\n\nMy only gripe is it needs more content. After the main story is over, you have the biggest Dreadnaugh, and you are fully upgraded, doing missions is a little pointless. The devs should open it up for modding. More ships, weapons, equipment, systems, etc., etc., and this game would be more than a hoot.\n\nDefinitely worth the $20.

Top five for sure. Basicly think of what it would be like if Empire at War's space battles weren't RTS, or if Battle Star Galactica Online wasn't for wallet warriors and wasn't unbalanced. The locked plane and broadside combat keeps the game simple and exciting and totally un-clunky, although sometimes the menus can be a bit difficult.\n\nThe ship designs are great too, especially the underated Sorcerer dreadnought (my personal favorite ship, by far) although sometimes the AI targeting gets confused due to the ship's geometry, which was fixed with the sorcerer for the main part but makes the McKinley my least favorite ship so far.\n\nAliens in this game also have good design by being Lovecraftian fish people or rad badger dudes and they all feel Star Wars inspired and combined with the hailing system also add a sort of Star Trek feel.\n\nOverall, the game is initially daunting and difficult to get used to, but after you've given it a chance it is absolutely great.","April 3","true","57.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Can feel limiting, ESPECIALLY when you have something thats below you, like an asteroid you want to laser to get to the goodies inside but your turret is on top so you have to maneuver in a way so that it reaches\n-Combat most of the time is just firing broadside weapons, managing your other turrets in combat is not viable\n-The camera is almost impossible to control unless you switch to broadsides. Game knows this and hints at it but it can take some getting used to especially during mining\n-Nearly EVERYTHING is automated. Meaning, for example, that if you want to engage "Warp" you have to wait for the game to give you the go ahead after you travelled for x distance. And retrieving a specific piece of cargo between many is really hard to do.\n-Controller is, as far as I can see, required.\n-The "Warp" will not get you to your destination immediately so you can sit back and wait until you arrive. Many time you have to almost drift out of the way of nebulas and asteroid fields. Its  easy to dodge but it can get annoying. If this makes the warping more interesting or annoying is up for debate. (I personally do not mind TOO much but I would want to sit back and let the game take me there without me doing anything sometimes)\n\n\nOverall: I like this game a lot. I played Freelancer and loved the heck out of that game too. And I noticed that even though you were not restricted to a 2d plane and it was dogfighting and not ship to ship combat in that game, I get a similar vibe from this game too.\n\nYou DEFINITELY get your moneys worth.","March 31","true","36.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I havent even left the first galaxy yet...hopefully there will be expansions as things go along. In the mean time there is plenty to do...trade, smuggle get into MANY fights. Upgrade your ship, get a new one...visit strange new places and interact with alien races... Some will be disatisfied there is not the depth of a sim...it DOES lean towards the arcade side...still...that to me isn't a huge deal. There are plenty of in depthe starship simmulations.

AWESOME! very blues rockish, gets you right in the mood to BE that Han Solo character or be your own Scruffy Nerfherder!\nThis was supposed to release on PS4 and I had been waiting, but no date...So I bought it...a couple of days later, what do you know...they released it  there as well.

Trading, Pirating, Distress calls, Even random events that affect the local markets or station access. The world is yours to toy with but you still need to pay attention to what is going on. You dont want to slam straight into a space station where there is a invasion going down. (Unless you are planning on clearing it up of course)\n\nThe combat is different that in other space oriented games. As you are flying Capital grade ships you cant fly UP or DOWN. Sounds bad but hang on. Fact is you dont need to. With some work your ship becomes a flying fortress. With plasma !BROADSIDES! and enough turrets on it to wipe out a fleet.As for valuing defense and offence its your call. Personally i like being up close so i took some fast acting cannons for close quarters. More damage, less range. The game is FULL of tradeoffs when it comes to arnament. So you need to pick your method carefully.\n\nPersonally i HIGHLY recommend this game to any game progression enthusiasts with a limited budget. The game is cheap, VERY long if you want to play all the way, and there are enough tactics and explosions around for a great experience.\n\n10 out of 10 in my book.","October 27, 2015","true","46.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I came to this off the back of Elite Dangerous, and have been completely satisfied. High risk missions pay more money (hauling huge munitions cargos into the middle of a siege is immensly rewarding), and you have full freedom to do whatever you want and explore the galaxy.

Period! I'm an emotional gamer so for me what makes or breaks a game is the FEELING a game emotes. It does not have to be perfect next gen graphics, or super solid gameplay, or the most original story ever. If it feels right and gives enjoyement then it's a success for me. Now obviously all previously mentioned things add up to the overall feel of a game. However they are like spice and are not the sole source of the 'magic' of a game. The cornerstone needs to be set right with a game or the whole building will start sinking crooked. For me this elusive thing in games is the feeling they magically either have or don't have. Take this game for example. It does not have award winning graphics or plot or even character development. It does not have a particular interesting story and the game makes no pretentions of it either. This game is not trying to be serious about itself and that my friends is what made a movie called tremors such a great fun flick in it's time. Solid practical effects, avoiding tongue in cheek direction or story for that matter is what made that movie have a great FEEL to it. Same here. By looking on this game's merits on paper by all means this should be a flop, but it's completely and utterly the opposite! This is why people betting on money and calculating companies trying to bank a bazillion of whatever currency they can get a hold of, will never see the light of day how to make a good solid fun entertainment! All I can say is, try this game out if you are a person like me and care for the overall feeling of a gameplay experience. The only good thing this game has on paper is it's soundtrack :D Perfect campy fun in a great way!\n\nHowever no game is perfect and hardly is this title here. This game is EASY to get into, but after awhile it becomes a grindtastic repetitive romp with not so good AI. Beware of these things if you are easilly turned off. It did not turn me off so much because the overall easiness and feeling the game churns out kept me at it enjoying getting better ships and weaponry. I am a casual gamer and I appreciate when a game is this accessible. However of course it would be great if this game had more depth and polish into it as it progresses. The devs could maybe make DLC for this title? Anyway I'm certainly looking for a sequel that tackles more with this titles shortcomings. I loved freelancer and was immediately at home with this one. Besides freelancer was not so much more complex gameplaywise as this one is. Peoples fond memories tend to get golden in time. I liked this one, so maybe give it a cautious try if you liked freelancer..","March 23","true","43.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Structurally, both games are very similar: you hop round the galaxy trading, mining, exploring, bounty-hunting and doing various missions, all the while earning credits so you can upgrade your ship and equipment. The main difference being this game removes all the tedium that ED insists you go through repeatedly and infinitely. Elite's station docking was fun for an hour or two, but after the 1000th dock, you just wish they'd just remove it...Rebel Galaxy removes this and you just insta-dock! Elite's 5 minutes with absolutely NOTHING to do while you warp to another station was never fun, and RG condenses this to a 10-30 second jump where you actually have some dodging and janking to do. Design decisions like this might make RG a more casual game than ED, but for me it also makes it 1000% more playable.\n\nThis brings us to the combat. Purists will frown on Rebel Galaxy for it's 2-D implementation of space versus Elite's glorious 3D, but at the end of the day the combat is arcadey in both games, and RG's combat simply manages to be much more FUN. And certainly more epic. 30+ ship battles while you blast fighters with your short range turrets, broadside their capital ships and unleash homing missiles at everything else are far more epic than anyting Elite managed to throw my way.\n\nSo my final description is that Rebel Galaxy is Elite with all the tedium removed, an actual story added, way better missions, and with considerably more fun combat. Which is what I've wanted in a space game since I racked up hundreds of hours of the original Elite on my Spectrum sometime back in the 1980s.\n\nTLDR: 8/10* this game is everything Elite Dangerous should have been\n\n* I would give this game 9/10 but for one annoying feature....you cannot view the local station map while docked. This means that you cannot easily plan the best cargo to buy or the best missions to take because you cannot see the optimum routes around the sector without seeing that local map. It's a quality of life thing that proves more frustrating than it might sound. If they fix that, this is a solid 9/10.","January 4","true","18.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

You make no decisions- just follow a waypoint indicator to the next mission. You don't aim, your weapons autoaim and some of them autofire. There is no terrain, occassional asteroids dot the map but they don't effect combat much. Every set of enemies feels identical - there is no variety whatsoever. The game is played strictly on a 2d plane. The only tactic I ever had to use was kite enemies from long range if I was overwhelmed (which was very rare).  Weapon variety is low and upgrade progression is linear.\n\nThe music quickly becomes dull, mostly twangy country music. Not a lot of variety.\n\nThe graphics are nice and ships show damage decalls when hit. There is a big variety in ship size and appearance. It would be nice if a ship 10 times my own ship's size was intimidating at all I guess.\n\nPerhaps most telling is the components present in the game. There's a lot of opportunity here, perhaps there could be a part that doubles your speed and halves your shields. Instead all of them give marginal benefits to your ship (like a 10% increase in turning speed). These components are all expensive, requiring more than a dozen missions of farming to get.\n\nThe entire game is a grind with no need for a player.

You get stuck on story missions due to enemy difficulty; go grind so you can do the next main mission. Repeat.

Keyboard and mouse controls feel pretty slip and slide too.\n\nFinally there's all the comparisons to Freelancer I want to put to bed.\nI played Freelancer for hours, probably hundreds of hours, I absolutely ADORED Freelancer, it was the ideal space sim for a plebian like me, nice and simple and really pretty while still feeling like it's in space.\nThis however is no Freelancer.\nThe combat is way too basic, the movement is way too restricted, the world is far too claustrophobic. Everythings packed and squeezed into this tiny 2D space where the concept of up and down are alien to the player character.\n\nSorry Freelancer fans, you're gonna have to keep going without.\n\nOverall this game's pretty naff.\n\nIt should have been a Naval game.","October 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

But combat is still a pain, many of the actions you can perform while flying demand the camera to be facing a certain direction and you can't steer you're ship while simultaneously aiming a broadside. But that's kind of OK, it just means that the game is aimed at beginers of this genre. It does do somethings well, like having shields and armour go down on different parts of the ship independently. Would be nice if they could also be upgraded independently.\n\nWhich brings me to my biggest gripe about the game. Upgrading your ship is dull. You have only a handful of options per part, which then go from Mk1 to Mk2 to Mk3, etc... Doesn't feel like an accomplishment to have my top speed under boost increase by 10%. Add to that that every battle feels the same (unless there are some unseen possible tactics I haven't come across) and the world is bland.\n\nBasically, when ever I played this game only one thought crossed my mind "Why am I not playing X3: Terran Conflict ?". It's not a perfect game by far, but it has all the depth that Rebel Galaxy lacks. It's not that it's a bad game, it just isn't interesting enough for me to make it fun. Perhaps the plot could have rescued it, but after 10h it is also boring and repetitive\n","December 24, 2015","false","31.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It isn't your traditional fare, and the game streamlines the experience of being a space captain. That said it plays like Firefly meets Pirates of the Caribbean. If you never have enjoyed playing games where you line up broadsides and enjoy the sweet victory as your enemy crumples under your withering fire...you might not like this game. If you do, and you like your universe dipped in hard whisky with plenty of grit on the side this game might be just your thing.\n\nThe Good:Ship combat is fast and furious, with most engagements and missions being over in a couple of minutes. Swarms of fighters, dancing beam weapons, and volleys of missiles light up the fights; all coming at you and maybe the poor sap you hired to protect you. Meanwhile you use a deflector (timed extra shield), main shields, and your armor to protect the innards of your ship while trying to line up a broadside as your turrets pick away at your opponent's shields. Because once someone is down to armor, it doesn't take that long before they are nothing be space dust.\n\nTrading, while simple, is still deep enough to enjoy. There is also mining, bounty hunting, distress calls (and ambushes), dead drop missions, and more to enjoy. You can spend hours alone in the first system building up reputation and your ship before stepping out into the wider galaxy...and you just might.\n\n\nThe Bad:As much fun as the combat can be, it sometimes falls a little heavily on your gear as to whether you can engage in that fight or not. Thankfully the game does a good job of tracking the threat level as to your chances of pulling off the fight or whether you need to pass or run away. Which even with a medium frigate all in top gear for the first system I'm finding I'm doing more running then fighting...yet. Mission boards also give you a threat level when you take them so you know you aren't walking into a complete curb stomp, but you will feel the sting of defeat if you don't pay attention and especially if you aren't willing to run away until your ship and equipment is more up to the task.\n\nThe other issue some might take is that this is all on a 2-D plane. So you don't go up or down with your ship, however fighters and objectives such an mine-able asteroids can be go/be off this plane. Turrets can handle these threats, but only if they can fire in that arc. As I discovered in mining however, you might need more then one of the expensive mining lasers to reach an asteroid depending on the turret placement and ship. They have a decent reach and make excellent short range beam weapons, but mining can be a pain and for as much investment you have to put into your ship to set it up to do right that can lead to some frustration.\n\n\nThe Ugly:Unfortunately the game doesn't feel like it's fleshed out ship wise. There are 21 ships you can supposedly fly over the course of the game, and about half of those will be available to you from the start, a few more unlocked by leaving the first system, and a handful unlocked by faction reputation. It would have been nice to see some heavy armored and fast gunships, or some lighter armored glass cannons. There is a class of ship called 'strike craft' which seems to drop off by the end of the first system.\n\nThe fighting can also get a little formulaic over time. I find running while my turrets pick off the fighters before engaging the larger ships to be the best road to success. Trading also can be a pain until you stumble upon the transponder that allows you to see the commodities of stations across the map without having to first dock at them.\n\nVerdict:If you enjoy broadsides and want a new type of scenario for your space faring adventures, this game might be just what you are looking for. If being a captain of a capital class ship isn't your cup of tea, then you still might want to pick it up on a sale. I recommend even at full price.","October 31, 2015","true","30.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alzorath/recommended/290300/","alzorath","Alzorath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alzorath/","759 products in account","(Review based on preview copy provided by developers)\n\nRebel Galaxy is a Space Opera with some pretty legendary names behind its creation, and it definitely shows. There's no question that it's worth the asking price of $20 USD - though it does have its pros and cons worth considering if it's the perfect fit for you, as well as some gameplay aspects some people will enjoy more than others.\n\n----\n\nImportant Notes:\n- This game involves trading, mining, and most of all - combat.\n\n- Combat is based on Naval combat, not standard 6-degree space combat, you will be using broadside cannons, ramming, and turrets for your capital ship on a horizontal plane (non capital ships use the full 6 degrees of freedom, but you don't get to fly those :P). This leads to interesting, yet still very satisfying, combat.\n\n- You have access to a lot of control with your ship, a lot of choices, including what tools you employ and how your weapons behave in battle - and they definitely have an impact on how you play.\n\n-You also have the ability to toy with alliances and factions, to change the system (improving/destroying your relations with different factions changes how you play the game)\n\n- Combat, either through Bounties, Missions, or Random Encounters will be your fastest way to gather resources and progress - though Trading/Mining are definitely still somewhat viable options.\n\n----\n\nPros:\n- Good visuals, with satisfying explosions, weapon fire, etc. And visible damage on your ship.\n\n- Amazing audio assets (and the ability to customize the audio if you want). Voice Acting is "good", not stellar, but the explosions, music, etc. are insanely well chosen.\n\n- Combat caters to both the casual captain and the aggressive player ( you can hang out on the fringe of battles, letting the automated turrets do the work, or you can dive in ramming/blasting with your broadsides, while ducking and dodging through swarms of bullets)\n\n- Solid story, while it won't win any awards, it's on par with Blizzard storylines ( "Okay" campaign story, Great universe )\n\n- Lots of freedom of choice... and travel. Aided by procedural generation of the sectors - so no 2 playthroughs are the same.\n\n- Fairly well optimized (sad that I have to note this, but compared to a lot of other games with similar visual fidelity lately - this one barely taxes my system at max settings)\n\n----\n\nCons:\n- Can get repetative after a while (go to point a, Kill stuff, get money, repeat) - but this tends to happen after the 10-20 hour mark for me. It does follow a formula similar to Diablo/Torchlight/etc. in that regard.\n\n- Can be slow paced at times, especially when a mission spawns more than 5000-6000 sm away, there is no fast travel within a sector, and while warp is fine for medium length trips, you will sometimes run into the issue of "staring at the back of your ship twiddling your thumbs".\n\n- "Out of Game" options menu... each time you launch you have the choice of changing the options, but you can't really change them in-game - so you might be restarting a few times to find the settings perfect for you.\n\n----\n\nWorks well with a controller or mouse & keyboard, despite their recommendations.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=538596449","October 20, 2015","true","9.4"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

The more I played it the less I enjoyed it. I was immediately pulled in with a fantastic soundtrack and interesting gameplay. However I realized very rapidly that the bit I got at the start was basically all there was. There's retrieval, protection, and shipping and those are your main mission types. You can mine for some ore to trade and you can buy low and sell high based on random events in the system you're in. It very quickly feels hollow because who cares if planet z is having problems so they need more of y item that you can buy elsewhere. None of it matters at the end, the issues resolve regardless of what you do. The main quest seems interesting enough but the quests are the same "blow up the bads retrieve mystic object" nonsense that the side quests are.\n\nOverall an interesting idea but not deep enough.","May 20","false","6.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

If my mining laser is on the bottom of the ship, good luck hitting an asteroid above your ship.  Scanning for asteroids gives no information of what you are mining for and as far as I can tell there is no item that does.  Certain weapons seemingly fire through your ship even though vision is blocked.  Really it's not a terrible game, but it's not a particularly good one.  Galaxy On Fire has more depth than this game.  The combat is good and interesting, the story is good and even the voice acting is good.  Graphics are fine.  Some small details were missed and the game was dumbed down more than it needed to be.  If you are looking for something really simple, then this game is for you.  It's on Galaxy On Fire's level.  If you are the type who likes the X Series or was into Eve Online and you were looking for something kind of in between in the single player realm, you will be slightly disappointed.","October 20, 2015","false","3.8"," 39 of 83 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","39","83","3","0"

It was all right and the price is fair. The main problem in my opinion is that every combat situation is basically the same. While the combat is OK it gets old really soon.\n\nThe main story is hardly the centerpiece, as everything else in this game it's (just) OK. The last mission was quite dissapointing, as a matter of fact I didn't even realize I was in the last stand off against the main baddies until it was over.\n\nEven though finished the main story I only visited 1/3 of all solar systems, partially bacause the story didn't take me there and parrtially because there was no reason to go there. In fact all systems are basically the same (the third I saw).\n\nThe second biggest problem after the staleness of combat is that the ship design isn't varried enough. There is little reason to buy the smaller faster ships. You basically buy the biggest "mobile weapons platform" smack a bunch of guns on it, park it in the middle of an eneny fleet and light them up.\n\nBuying defensive upgrades soon is the best investment, esspecially an early mk5 shield and plating. Unfortunatelly it makes the combat even more drab, because you bassically cannot die (for most of the game).","October 25, 2015","false","31.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

There are several cons and some pros in the game.\n\nPros:\n-Stunning graphics\n-Cool ship design\n-Unique names for characters\nThats about it when you are 40 minutes in.\n\nCons:\n-Unkillable AI at times, even when aiming\n-Spawn Traps (Debris and such)\n-Slow speed even with sublight booster\n-Mediocre aiming mechanic\n-Reversed and slowed down english dialouge and named "Alien language"\n-Annoying and way too loud soundtrack, only plays one darn song the entire time\n-When you die, it puts you in the main menu, not at the last checkpoint\n\nSo, heres a story, when I was doing a mission for that alien guy in the beginning:\nI got into the first ship you get I drove over to this place far away and got slowed down by a planet, pushed onwards anyways. So when I got there I stopped at warp and was fighting this Missle Corvette, I recall, but then end up smashing head first into this broken apart ship. I tried for about 12 minutes trying to escape but no, I could not. So I waited to die and I loaded the game back up. I flew over again and fired at the enemys, only to find the AI WAS INVINCIBLE. YOU DO NOT CHARGE 19.99 FOR A GAME THIS BAD. If your AI is invinicble more than THREE DAMN TIMES, We got a problem. I tried everything, changing my weapons, reloading the game, even restarting my PC. Nothing worked. If your going to charge me 19.99 for a sad sorry excuse for a game that seems to still be in Alpha, you better go join EA, they are looking for people like you.\n\nSo in conclusion, this is a sad sorry excuse for a game, needs more than one patch and I am asking for a full refund for this garbage. I'll buy Skyrim instead, better option.\n\nAnd remember: THIS IS MY OPINION. It is niether true, nor false.","November 12, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","2"

Some things that I don't like, roughly in order of most irritating:\nWaiting for information to cycle.  When looking at commodities, whether on the commodities screen or on the map, instead of having a scrollable list, pages/lines will cycle every 4 seconds or so.  This creates a) a lot of waiting and b) you can't stop the cycle when your item comes up and actually read it.\nAll scrolling lists and menus move one item at a time.  You can still select something with the mouse if it's on the screen, though, assuming you can see it or figure out what it is while it's grayed out.\nNo way to display the sector map while docked.\nNo way to create multiple waypoints, meaning you can't plan out routes that navigate around hostiles or asteroid belts.\nNo way to zoom your camera in/out, resulting in a lot of screen space always being occupied by your (albeit gorgeous) ship.\nNo speed indicator on the HUD, for you or your targets.\n\nIf the UI gets fixed, I'll likely dump countless hours into this game and come back and rewrite my review, but until then, I can only say that it feels like a really clunky console port.","October 25, 2015","false","4.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

What a fantastic game!!! It's been a long time since I have played a game that hits that special spot of enjoyment that makes me just want to keep playing. I love this game...\n\n\n\n--UDATE--\n\nHaving finally made it to the second system, I can say that I am absolutely pleased with this game. The next sector has bigger and better ships, weapons, and modules to fit with. I also went into the third sector and saw that the ships get even larger, with even better gear. Unfortunately, I was totally unprepared for how much herder that new system was, so I had to go back.\n\nMan! This game is awesome!\n\nI haven't played it for a very long time, but what I have played, I certainly like.\n\nThe ships all feel different, the progression feels substantial, and getting new weapons and systems for each ship makes everything feel a lot more visceral.\n\nOne of my favourite things about the game is that you can fit up your ship with some new gear and truly feel a difference in power, making you feel like a real space bad@ss.\n\nCertainly worth the asking price, in my books.","November 7, 2015","true","43.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I really did.\n\nReading other reviews and watching videos reminded me of Escape Velocity: Nova, a great Ambrosia game from oh so long ago.  I thought that this game could capture the same magica that game possesed but with the updated flare of almost 20 years of gaming advances.\n\nUnfortunatly, I was wrong.\n\nCombat in Rebel Galaxy feels dry, leaving you endlessly flying in circles trying to keep fighters on screen.  Capital ship combat, while entertaining for the first 20 minutes, comes down to trying to land as many broadsides as possible which, once again, leads to flying in circles.\n\nThe 2-d movement that was great in a top down space trading game like Escape Velocity is restrictive and unnatural.  At no point could I suspend my disbelief and imagine that I was piloting a space ship.  Any sense of immersion is ruined by this element.\n\nWith all that said the game isn't bad looking and the price is pretty low.  That might be enough to make this game an enjoy able experience for some but it didn't make it worth it for me.","October 22, 2015","false","2.5"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

The side missions, of which you'll do a whole load, have Risk estimates next to them. These estimates are entirely useless. You can get face melted in a Normal, and never even notice your shields getting touched in a Very High. The power boost between gear levels is also really large, more than 50% boost usually. This means you're going to get melted often when heading into a new area whilst you try to scrape together the money to make your ship competitive.\n\nThis power difference pretty much kills the immersion as well. Why are two systems, right next door to each other, at such differences in weapon tech? Why doesn't a single ship from the high area go to the low area and just take over?

What I got was neither. This game has so much potential, but is hugley hurt by a number of things.\n(If you're wondering why my play time is so low its because I plan to get a refund and because the glaring problems are obvious from the start.)\n\nFirstly the thing I noticed first that bugged me was that, you ARE LOCKED TO A SINGLE PLANE OF MOVEMENT!(sounds small but it is SO annoying) Now if this were top down, this wouldnt be a problem, but the view is thrid person, making it painfully obvious how limited you are. What makes it worse is that other ships (including those you fight) can fly freely, making combat confusing and disorienting.\n\nSecond, the graphics, nice enough at first (tough not at all cutting edge) but the problem there isn't poorly done graphics, it's OVERDONE graphics, I am being entirley honest when I say that the lens flare/ lighting effects during (one dimensional)'flight' actually HURT to look at.\n\nAnd finally, parts of it just feel....off. Little things, like a cramped UI in stations with loads of wasted space, or dialogues with characters (which are admittedley quite nicley done) feeling far too zoomed in and with no ability to use the keyboard for dialouge choices (up, down, enter or even 1,2 and 3).\n\nIt's a nice idea that wasn't done badly, but its just not quite 'right' to play.

I'm sure when I was younger I would have burned down the developers. But really, my apathy towards never being able to play that game again probably is as harsh a burn as I'm capable of delivering at this point.\nThe first dozen or so times you do each mission are fun. Then it's just endless grinding. I'm not going to ever play this game again, because I'd have to start a new game, which would be a ton of grinding to get to where I was, which was a part of the game that involved grinding.\nI think the price is fair, but I can't say that it's actually worth all the time required to beat it.

This game is Sid Meier's Pirates LITE. You have no major interaction with any factions, and can not partake in major game map changing ways. It's essentially the combat of Sid Meier's in Space, with nothing close to SMP's metagame. It's the very definition of shallow. Everything will one way or another end up with a blaster in your face. You want to trade or mine? Good luck. You'll be needing a good turret.\n\nUltimately I don't recommend this game despite the fact that I know a lot of people may enjoy it.

Camera + controls (really, gamepad optimal, who are you kidding) + enemies + lack of distinct options controlling your own weapons makes this game a hassle.\n\nAdded on top of it, that it's a big ol'grind fest in a single player game, and you lose my interest quickly.\n\nThat said, there aren't a lot of good scifi options these days, so a lot of people will find the 20$ entry fee to be acceptable for the amount of entertainment within.","October 22, 2015","false","8.3"," 12 of 31 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","12","31","0","1"

Game controls and menus are clearly optimized for gamepads, but mouse look is laggy and has too much inertia. Lining up broadsided are a pain (inertia is OK with analog sticks, with mouse it is annoying as hell), turret control is just horrible (see above).\n\nFOV could be wider (or adjustable) – your ship taking 1/4 of screen at all times is very annoying, especially on ultrawide screens. And it's not pretty on big screen, textures are console-quality and look muddy.\n\nP.S. Regarding gameplay – warp! It is boooooring. You undock, you warp, you watch distance decreasing for 2 minutes. You fight, you win, you warp, you watch distance decreasing for 2 minutes. Rinse, repeat.\n\nI won't recommend this game to Mac users – game is designed for gamepad, gamepad is not supported.","October 22, 2015","false","1.1"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","24","4","17","0","0"

I learned in the forums after a kind soul let me know that there are videos/links to videos in the game if you press esc/start button and look for them in the menus there.   Never would have thought that the equivalent of the manual? i guess would be in the menu.\n\nMost of everyone else was busy saying the equivalent of 'man up', so not the greatest community if you are looking for any kind of help.\n\nThe game might be fun but you will have to put up with non-intuitive controls until the developers improve them or actually give more information to the players.  So at this point the game seems more to be in EA state rather than released state.  I say EA because games in those states are the ones that I expect with no manual/minimal explanation of controls when control scheme is not intuitive.\n\nAlso becareful since some of the reviews mention that it reminds them of other games space games like freelancer/(insert awesome space game) but they fail to mention that the game movement/combat is in 2D like Starpoint Gemini.\n\nSo TLDR; Gamble: might be good but be warned that controls aren't the best and community not the most helpful.  This game is more like an enhanced Starpoint Gemini.\n\nEdit:\nThe review mentions community as since the 'tutorial' to basic keys is lacking then it means that the users have to rely on 'community'.\n\nOn the plus side though the developers seem to be good though so there is a future.\n\nCONS:\n- Controls not all intuitive\n- Tutorial, according to other players you have to play > 15mins before you actually get to it.\n- Aweful community (don't expect help from 90% of it and have a thick hide when asking).\n- Universe is 2D like Starpoint Gemini (some people like this so if you are ok with it then you good).\n\nPRO:\n- Devs seem to nice and involved so a few weeks or months the game might become much better.\n- Possible gem in the future, so maybe hold out until later.","October 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 14 of 75 people (19%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","19","14","75","2","3"

The look and feel\n\nLooks ok, especially considering this is an indie title. Especially the spaceships have a cool touch to them.\n\n2. Controls\nInstead of freelancer or even EVE controls, they decided to do some strange console like UI navigation & flight controls on a 2D plane orientation (in space?!?). They felt clunky and unintuitive to me.\n\n3. Combat and space gameplay\n\nThis is in my oppinion the biggest issue - the broadside combat might be a good idea in theory, but not how it is applied here - since the ships often behave more like fighter craft than behemoth ships shooting broadsides at each other, it is highly annoying to control. And most of it is strangely semi automated with snapping auto aims etc. - I get the feeling this was "consoled" down.\nWhy not just do something classic like freespace or freelancer? Free movement and skill aiming in a full 3D environment, not on a 2D plane with strange autoaim and clunky movement?\n\n4. Strange camera behavior\nReally annoying was the camera, which would zoom in and zoom out during screen switchens (and interpreting this as a warp)\n\n5. Story\nI guess 15 years ago, it was quite ok to receive storyline quests from some shady guys in a spaceport bar.  Transfer it to today in a slighly better 3D look instead of pixel characters, and it no longer is so cool. Especially since the writing does not hook you.\n\n6. Who put the afterburner on "W" and not on "tab" - seriously :)\n\nFacit\n\nSeeing all the positive feedback, there are defenitly pilots who will like this game, and it is probably not a bad game. From the previews I thought i would like it too. But after really playing it - it just doesn't feel right. Guess waiting for a reboot of freelancer then.","November 18, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of repeting all that has been said. I will say that this game feels like FTL on steroids. Plentty of ships to customize, you have to grind to get credits and stuff to update your ship. You can hire mercenaries to improve your ship. And every now and then you will face a fleet that you have to run. All this with great graphics, sound and gameplay.\n\nThe only difference from FTL is that this game doesn´t flip a coin when you start the game giving you a maybe chance to finish it. Which in my opinion was the stuff that i found really frustrating of FTL.\n\nBut it has been replaced with endless grinding to upgrade you ship to keep advancing. You could choose not to upgrade and go test your ship, but eventually you will fail. So grinding is necessary and a lot. The other thing that i find pretty annoying is the travel distance between objectives. At first it is fun, because you actually need to avoid stuff, but after a while is annoying. And the distances can take some time to get too, this makes the grinding much more irritating.\n\nBut i still feel the game is worth every penny of you money, and as many have said the soundtrack is awesome.","November 18, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like games like privateer and X2 and Freelancer, then this one is one you will enjoy.  If you enjoy space games with sweeping stellar vistas then again you should find this one good.  I don't know about you but I *hate* difficulty settings, again this game doesn't have that; if you are getting your butt kicked, do some side missions and upgrade your gear and you're back in the action.

Try it, you'll be pleasantly surprised.\n\n****SPOILER ALERT****\nWhen trading, be savvy, some systems have a particular defficit others an abundance.  For example, one system will have serious problems with pirates and will have a strong demand for munitions while a neighboring peaceful system will have a cheap abundance of munitions.

On a personal note, this is the only game in my library where I've had to think really hard about giving it a thumbs up or down.\n\nWhat is it: imagine a sid meiers pirates in space. Its open world, with emphasis on combat. You fly into two dimensional space combat and shoot your broadside cannons into your opponent. I'm not praising or condemning this mechanic, its just the way it is. You can trade, but in the most simple sense of the word, the game tells you which resources are too highly priced/ lowly priced in each station. If you cannot complete the next required story mission, the only thing you can do is to go grind for more credits to upgrade until you can.\n\nPros\n- Simple\n\nCons\n- Too simple\n\nThe lightspeed travelling is really annoying, I've spent probably more than half my ingame time travelling from A to B and you automatically drop out of "warp" if you encounter something. So you have to sit there listening to a very limited soundtrack waiting an average of about a minute till you reach your destination, trying to avoid asteroid fields etc. Longest warp time has been around 2 minutes, you get where you need to go, blow someone up and spend 2 minutes warping back.\n\nI didnt make it past the second world by the time I decided to stop playing (so I can only give information relevant up to that point in the game). Your main source of damage against big ships are your broadsides and missiles, this requires no planning or skill. Fire as much and as fast as you can and hope they blow up first. If you blow up first, dont retry, you will die again, there is no strategy to change. Upgrade one module on your ship (shield, broadside, turret) go back and you'll win. Rinse and repeat. Dont get me wrong the first hour is a blast but when you realise that you've experienced 90% of the game already, its pretty demoralising - and I'm not one to sit there to finish grinding it through till the end just for the sake of completion (though it took me a while to come to that conclusion).\n\n","November 22, 2015","false","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, where to start?\n\nWell, I'll start basic. This game is basically what it looks like: a space trucker sim with combat that is similar to the ship-to-ship combat in Assassins Creed: Black Flag, with the primary weapons being broadside cannons and turrets. If you've heard that this game starts out kinda crappy, you heard right. The starting ship (a Hammerhead called the "Rasputin") is exactly what the intro cinematic says it is: a near-derelict ship with lousy hull & shielding, and the cannons are more akin to pop guns than actual weapons.\n\nBut that's the whole point, isn't it? You build yourself up by killing baddies, taking quests, maybe mining some, although I personally avoided mining as much as I could in this game. (Too boring.) The idea is to earn enough cash so you can spend it on upgrading your ship's weapons, shields and armor to the point that enemies that once gave you a mountain of trouble will now regret ever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off... right before their ships explode and you suck up whatever cargo they dropped.\n\n[As an extra note, some games may think it's cool to have increased prices for purchases, lowered prices for sales. Not this one! Here, if you purchase a turret for 5,000 credits and then decide to sell it later (possibly because you'd just picked up a better version), you'll still receive 5,000 credits back. Same goes for hull, shield, and engine upgrades.]\n\nAnd of course you'll want to swap out your starting ship for a better one as quickly as possible. One with more turret slots, more broadside cannons, more cargo space, and a better hull. You'll also want to purchase some special components for your ship, like Heat Management which reduces the amount of heat your turrets generate when firing, allowing them to fire more often.\n\nWhich brings me to weapon setups. When it comes to setting up your strategy, your first perrogative will be to find a setup which works for you. Personally, I ran with Tachyon broadsides for their fast rate of fire, Heatseekers for secondary weapons, and my turret of choice was the Pulse variant for their range & damage per shot, although I do recommend equipping a Korian Viridian laser cannon if you happen to find one. (I managed to find two, one a Mrk 2, the other a Mrk 5 late in the game.)\n\nYour second concern will be learning how best to maneuver in a high-tension battle. This is a 2D arena, so you won't have to worry about capital ships hitting you from above or below. But fighters will swarm around you, attempting to knock out your shields so their bigger cousins can finish you off. And by the way, your shields deplete based on which side gets hit, meaning that if you take too many hits to starboard, your starboard hull will be exposed and vulnerable; take too many hits to starboard after that, you're a goner. Oh yeah, I've had a couple of deaths where the shields were still strong on everywhere except where the enemy was currently hitting me en masse.\n\nHere's my pro strategy though: when engaged in a pitched battle, move out to the sidelines to draw the fighters away and have your turrets take those out first. After which, you'll want to position yourself so the capital ships will be on only one side at a time. Then throttle down so that you can turn faster as needed. Just keep fire broadsides at them while your turrets provide backup, and when your shields on that side start to lose their charge, turn around so the other side will be facing them and then repeat the procedure.\n\nHowever, there is something I should mention: up until the third star system, your main obstacle is pirates who fire nothing but regular rounds and missiles at you. Once you get to the third system, however, you'll meet the Greel. These guys (both their fighters and their capital ships) feature Leech weapons which fire EMP missiles at you. And these things  not only do a good amount of damage to your shields, but they do a number on your engines as well. So your best bet is to get the EMP Ablation component (what the hell kind of word is that?) so that EMP weapons won't cause quite as much trouble.\n\nNevertheless, a well-upgraded ship can handle just about anything. Just find the style and setup that works best for you and get out there. Just remember if things start to go ♥♥♥♥-up, there ain't no shame in making a run for it. All the money in the galaxy won't comfort you if you're dead.\n\nAs the game itself, it's single player only and can be played offline if you please. Although you won't be able to make progress on achievements without being online, I found out. Also, the musical tracks they used in this game, while good, can get really repetitive; I ended up muting it. And if there's one gameplay feature I'm iffy about, it's that the best lasers in the game (the Korian Viridians) are random drops, no way to purchase them in a spaceport.\n\nThere's also the issue with communications with the npcs in the game: they're pretty limited. Not to mention that the pirates seem to have trouble realizing when they're outmatched and that surrender would be in their best interest. Like I'll be flying an Arcturus-class Destroyer (which is strongly reminiscent of the Imperial Star Destroyer from Star Wars) armed to the teeth with top-notch weapons and they'll still be talking ♥♥♥♥... right up until I blow them to smithereens.\n\nAnd speaking of the AI, there's the escort missions. Now, the way it works is that you fly to a location, approach the client, and hold down E to Pair Warp. What that does is that the AI takes full control of your ship, keeping it alongside the ship even as you two go into warp. Noble in itself but it can lead to some annoying results. For one, when two ships are alongside each other, a human would say that the best course of action is to throttle down and turn right to line up with the client; the AI meanwhile turns your ship left, causing your back section to collide with the client's. And why is it that every escort mission has to start in an asteroid field or a ice field? Because just now I had a mission start in an ice field, I was flying a dreadnaught and it took 5-10 minutes just to get started! The AI kept maneuvering us around the ice field, taking me one direction him another. And just when I thought we were getting out of this mess, it had the client move back into the field, prolonging this mess. I had to break warp pairing, and move my ship out of the ice field myself just to get us going.\n\nWas I annoyed by all of this? Yeah, I'd say it goes without saying that I was.\n\nThen there are the missions where you fly in and save someone from enroaching hostiles. There's a good chance they'll get themselves blown up because they decided to fly into the middle of a pack of hostiles. And as Harrison Ford said in The Last Crusade "Are you crazy?!? Don't go between 'em!!"\n\nAll in all though, it's a good game, well-worth the asking price. Combat can get a little challenging at times (especially with the Greel I mentioned above) but it's easy to learn & of moderate difficulty to master, just the way I like it. And if all that wasn't enough, the developers also made sure to include a risk analysis for each mission that adjusts based upon anticipated enemy strength against that of your own. And while not all the ship designs are prize-winners, there are some really good ones.\n\nSo yes, I definitely recommend this game. It's cheap, it's challenging, and it'll last a long time. Hell, there're some triple-A titles that won't last as long as this game will! [cough, cough... Star Wars Battlefront: EA... cough, cough]","December 20, 2015","true","58.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But there are a few issues, but they are minor at best.\n\nIssues:\n1. No paint jobs for your ship. You can't change the color of the ships. Be nice, but not game breaking.\n2.Money, there is none. The next ship above mine has a price tag of 15.5 MILLION credits. The best sales of mining goods: 15k. Jobs: 6500-25000. One neted me 131k, but my ship was in ruins after the job.\n3. NO HIGHT ADJUSTMENT! If you are a mining sort, you'll be useing laser turrets. Problem is, most ships have turets on the underside as well as the upper decks. To bring all to bare, you need to either have a ship with all turrets clustered which sucks in combat most of the time, or park around 2km away so you don't swiss cheese your own ship. And just because youe are locked on a 2d movement, does NOT constrict the asteroids to stay on your level. So now they are out of your firing arks. It does simplify movement, but it would still be nice.\n\nIn review, just be ready to get your ♥♥♥ handed to you in a cute bow for a few hours then you have to go through a warp gate and repeat the whole cycle over again.

First off great work to the creators of this little fantastic space game.  Finally these guys had the balls enough to put Rock Music in a Space Game and it really ramps up the excitement , I got all the dust cleaned out of my Bose speakers on this game and nothing but a big smile on my face when the explosions started from my missles  firing out the sides of my ship.\nSure there are some things that an older player might sqeem at as far as the cartoonie characters you meet but it's not a far trade off from Jaba.  The ships are superb in design and id have to say they look better than a few of the top rated space sim games on the market.  They give you plenty of mounting options for Lasers,Rockets,Missles,Mines and Mining Lasers that can be used for fighting aswell.\n\nThere is a Storyline to the game and it's good...... I'm glad there is a storyline here some of the bigger space sims decided to leave out storylines and there games feel like there is somthing always missing even in the missions they have.  Rebel Galaxy seems to understand this and always has some npc in the game coming on screen to talk to you about your next mission or a character trying to make a deal with you.  You are not alone in rebel space there is always someone around to greet you rather if it's good or bad.  This i'm sure is a trail space game by Double Damage to see how it does and all i can say is please give us more we like it.  Well i do any way, this is a great space game to play for a few months and you can't beat the price.  score 86/100","October 26, 2015","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays more of an arcade game rather than a space sim so for those looking for the latter might want to look somewhere else. What this game has is a procedurally-generated, sandbox solar systems set on a 2D plane where the player can explore right from the start.\n\nFor starters, the player's ship can't roll, pitch, or yaw (sorry, no Crazy Ivan manuevers here) - only forward movement, and left/right turns. This is because the game’s combat is designed around the broadside naval engagements similar to Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. Basically, you line up your ship (think of it as a space boat) against the enemy ship for a firing solution, and then unload your armaments to see some fireworks. It might sound easy but it has its share of tactical positioning and maneuvering - each side of your ship (front, rear, port, and starboard) has a hull and shield rating. After you eat through a ship’s shield face, you start hitting its hull to do some serious damage. You can spin that damaged side out of the line of fire to regenerate your shields and retaliate or simply retreat and fight another day.\n\nThe game has a decent selection of weaponry, ships, and ship upgrades. You can also choose to align with different factions but sadly, they have no personalities to speak of outside of the nicely animated talking avatars they have.\n\nThere is a main quest you can follow, or ignore it and set out in any direction you want and be a trader, a miner, a bounty hunter, or space pirate. You can get missions from space stations that can earn you currency to buy ships/weapons/ship upgrades, as well as alignment points to factions. The said missions can get pretty repetitive after a while, but the gloriously huge space battles keep me coming back for more.\n\nExploration in this game is fun and is rarely dull. It has the same relaxing feel as doing cross country delivery jobs in Euro Truck Simulator 2. There are asteroid fields, floating space junk from the ruins of some old battle (which may contain some sweet loot and military grade weaponry), nebulae of different swirling colors, planets, moons, and of course, stars. It will take a few minutes to fly from point A to point B, but there’s usually some unidentified signal, a distress call, or just a random fleet of space bandits to keep things interesting.\n\nThe game’s soundtrack is really good. It exudes the same vibe as Firefly with its guitar heavy tracks with twangs. The devs also included the most phenomenal custom music support I have ever seen in a game. There’s nothing like Want It All Back from Cowboy Bebop kicking in as I enter combat. I have Cage the Elephant, Clutch, Johnny Cash, Darren Korb (Bastion OST), Queens of the Stone Age, Yoko Kanno (Cowboy Bebop), Vitaminless (Cowboy Bebop), and Bear McCreary (Battlestar Galactica) on my custom playlist. You can sort and assign them as combat, idle, or title music. Your custom music can also be merged with the game soundtrack for more variety.\n\nI definitely recommend this game.","October 26, 2015","true","58.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Throw in a distinctly wild-West, frontier ambience driven by the look of the ships (most definitely in the Solo-esque tradition of "she may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts") and the pumping country-rock backing track and you're close to what Rebel Galaxy is all about.\n\nThe biggest single bone of contention people seem to have with this game is that it's a space sim that doesn't allow movement in any axis.  For me, this really isn't an issue.  The combat is deliberately designed with an emphasis on broadside-heavy battles.  This simply wouldn't work well across 3 axes.  As I mentioned at the top, combat in this is something akin to Sword of the Stars 1 on steroids - and for me it works beautifully.\n\nI would imagine that the greatest strength of this game could potentially be its greatest weakness: much like the original Elite, there isn't really a great deal of hand-holding; yes, there are storyline-driven missions to follow, but equally you're free to indulge in any of the time-honoured space-game traditions of trading, bounty-hunting or piracy.  From what I can make out, most players (myself included) seem to eschew the story and focus on doing our own thing.\n\nIn terms of negatives; well, there is undeniably a 'grind' aspect as you're generally striving to get the next best ship or increase your reputation with somebody but as yet I haven't found this to be a problem - it's a mechanic that is always likely to be present in games of this ilk, as Elite: Dangerous proves.\n\nAll in all, I think this is a brilliant, absorbing game that's an absolute steal at the price.  It puts many AAA titles to shame, especially, as if I've heard, the development team is only two strong!\n\n9/10.  Wholeheartedly recommended.","October 26, 2015","true","45.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Find the best way to earn cash. Trade commonities, take up missions, etc.\n2. Use the money you earn to upgrade your capital ship.\n3. Shoot the living craps out of the enemies and proceed to the next galaxy.\n\nBy this point of my gameplay which is around 29hrs of playtime, game is becoming like a grind.\nWhat kept me going is mainly the prospect of getting a bigger and more badass capital ship.\n\nSome things that come into mind.\n- Game is developed by a 2-person team, and for this price, a big plus\n- Great graphics, music, and voice acting.\n- No way to build a fleet and do massive scale attacks (at least I haven't found any yet)\n\nOverall this is still a plus. Maybe 7/10. Can last you 20-30hrs at least.\nAs for me, probably looking at the next game to play soon.\n","October 26, 2015","true","30.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I barely notice it.  It plays well in 2D (not to say 3D wouldn't be better).\n\nReminds me a lot of Privateer, but with more sandbox, less story.\n\nLots of fun to be had here.\n\nThe combat is surprisingly deeper than I expected.","October 26, 2015","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
