A lot has seemingly changed since then. This review focuses on what at the time, was a very big problem with the game and what many other players felt needed changing (see older forum threads).\n\nThe devs and the gaming community have since said that Koshey (a red card) is no longer imbalanced. As such, this review would no longer be relevant.\n\nI'm leaving the review "as-is" until I play the game again, in which case I'll update the review accordingly. So until then, please take this review with a grain of salt.\n\n========================\n\nPerhaps the single most P2W game on Steam.\n\nThere is only 1 card you need to win this game: Koshey.  Period. He's a red card (epic). There are only a couple dozen different cards (there isn't much variation at all), but this one, single card dominates them all.\n\nIf you do not have Koshey, yet your oppoent does, exit the match. You'll be wasting time otherwise. Koshey takes very little damage from any other hero card in game, takes very little spell damage, has a big chance to rez when (if) he dies, and 1-2 hits any other hero in the match.\n\nKoshey can be defeated by playing A LOT of other cards against it...each taking a quick death, but doing at least a small amount of damage to him. The problem with that however, is that if you have Koshey, you get him out asap...before the opponent can get more than 2-3 heroes out.\n\nKoshey, by himself, will march down the lane, take out 2-3 heroes very easily (which is at max, how much can be created in the same time period), then destroy the gate.\n\nIt's an absurd card that makes the game completely unfun. But, everyone recognizes this to be true, so most people will spend money on packs until they get him.\n\nThere is only 1 meta in this game: Koshey.\n\nInterested concept...but one of the worst deliveries possible.","September 2, 2015","false","4.2"," 117 of 151 people (77%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","77","117","151","14","38"

LoginTried to create a new account with name and password. Got a neverending loading screen. Opened the task manager and shut down the game. Started it again. The login data I creaed was already inserted and worked. I logged in.\n\n2. OverviewThe game opened, the music was nice. I saw a chat and watched it for about 30 seconds. There was not a single english word written. Everybody chatted in russian, which is a bad sign already. I saw some currency symbols and could determine which is the real cash currency immediatly.\n\n3. The tutorialThe tutorial gave me the basic techniques on how to play the game. I tried it, my dolls did not walk correctly. Instead they sometimes slipped forward and backwards. But that was no problem. The tutorial was short and I thought I'd give the game a try.\n\n3. The matchAfter another loading screen of doom, bypassing the still all russian chat, I finally entered the matchmaking. An opponent was found. I used my 3 cards that I also had in the tutorial. The match started. The first card he played ripped my first 2 cards in pieces without being seriously injured. Great blancing so far. So I played a third card, but his first card was already at my keep and had it down to half its health. My third card attacked, but could not do anything and the moment I was about to be destroyed, my opponent surrendered. What - the - ...? The match ended, but I got another loading screen of doom. Task manger - end task. Steam library - delete game.\n\nGreat experience.","September 22, 2015","false","0.2"," 68 of 83 people (82%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","82","68","83","26","0"

The general idea is to build a scene where your cloth puppets beat the crap out of the other side's cloth puppets. You start by building resource generators for things such as wood and cloth. These resources are then used to purchase units to kick down the gate of the enemy. If you manage to reduce the enemy's gate to zero HP before they do the same to you, you win. Sadly, it is just not interesting.\n\nPROS\n1. Easy to Learn\nTutorial is simple to understand. Build a deck of cloth puppets and send them out to battle.\n\n2. Graphics\nThe Unity Engine makes it look passable.\n\nCONS\n1. Cash Shop\n$29.99 for 2070 buttons. Use it to buy more XP and Button Boosters. No thank you. I don't enjoy Pay To Win.\n\n2. Low Population\n100 seconds of waiting and no game.\n\n3. Boring\nCloth puppets just don't excite me. I don't enjoy it.\n","January 6","false","0.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

The people saying this probably got matched into a couple of bad games and thought that the cards that other people had were unlocked through in game transactions. I got all of necessary cards by simply playing the game.\n\nGameplay & balance In terms of gameplay, the game is extremely unbalanced and can be hard for new players who don't understand how the level scaling works. When starting off, only having 3 cards and not having a solid strategy, the game can seem boring and unfair (not saying it isn't, but maybe not as much as the first impression might suggest). It generally consists of throwing out your robot and reaper in the lvl 1-2 range, beating your opponent in 30 seconds if they put their resources into production and didn't plan to counter your attack. Until lvl 7ish the game will consist of these cheesy strats, from my experience it seems you get random cards from matchmaking and so you might have a bad experience between these lvls, but by the time you get to around lvl 7ish you should have enough of the cards to make a solid deck. The problem I have at this point is that the "Sabotage" card is way too strong and completely controls the game. Whoever uses this card effectively, stopping your opponents resources and research will win. There are not enough cards in the game to allow varied decks, and the Sabotage card has to be in your deck at the higher levels or you lose. This is the main problem I have with the game, there is no where near enough variety in cards making the game boring after you get to this point.\n\nI will give the game some credit, it can be fun for those who hate the large amount of micro-management in modern rts games but like the idea behind it. Getting a strategy together with different cards and finding the best way to manage your resources can be fun, but it still doesn't help the fact that there isn't enough variation in the games mechanics for it to be fun for over 10hrs.\n\nBugs and "Bugs" So what about how the game runs? Does it have noticable bugs? What about the community?\nWell I can't say there is much positivity here. The game runs fine which is somewhat expected from what is essentially a mobile port. The big problem comes with the random crashes and some weird bugs that will force you to restart the game. Can't say much about the crashes except that they are random and somewhat frequent, never found a cause, never found a pattern as to when they happen. Adding to this, me and some friends who played the game encountered a bug in which the game would stick on a loading screen after a battle. The only way to get past this as far as I know is to restart the game. This bug seemed very frequent when I first started playing the game, though it seemed to happen less and less the more I played the game.\n\nSo onto the main bugs I encountered in the game. The bugs are mostly just annoying, but annoying is still taking away from the game experience and I think its important to point them out. First up is a wierd bug in which your heroes will just teleport back and forth as they are going along. This can be a problem when using spells on your heroes, but its not a huge problem outside of just being really annoying. Somewhat similar to the first bug is the strange way that rooms work. Resources seem to update very slowly, clicking to build a room can be slow with the building appearing a second after clicking to build the room. Probably doesn't seem like a big problem, but it just makes the game seem so out of sync and awkward. Final bug I've encountered a few times is a bug when searching for a match. So you want to play a game against another player, click play and wait... and wait.... and then you get impatient so you try to cancel the matchmaking and it does nothing. Turns out it was glitched and it was probably not searching for a match anyway. So you have to restart the game and click play again, takes 10-30 seconds and you are in a game. Again, its mostly just annoying but when annoying is so frequent in a game its hard to start liking it.\n\nSo I'll quickly mention the global chat and move on. Most of it is russian which is fine because you are not very likely to make friends on this game anyway. The problem comes with the random spam and racism that appears in the global chat. There is no community for this game so don't expect to find other people willing to make friends.\n\nConclusion So if you want to pass the time with a fun little game I would say go play another indie title like binding of isaac or FTL. But if you don't have the money to get those titles and you happen to come across this game, give it a try. I enjoyed what I played then got bored really quickly. It has bugs to fix and needs to sort out its balancing, but its free to play and has a very small file size, so just try it out. If you can get past the bugs then you might just have fun playing this simple strategy game about pitting toys against eachother in a staged base race.","October 4, 2015","true","8.5"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","18","26","2","0"

It doesn't explain all the different things you can build and it doesn't tell you you should try things out in training mode.\n- matchmaking is a little wonky, probably due to low amounts of online players. It can match you with people from the top of the rankings even in your first match.\n- it takes time to get enough ingame currency to buy anything at all. Highest amount I got from a battle was around 250 whereas you need about 1k for a simple card upgrade from level 1 to 2 or 10k for 3 new random cards.\n\nUp to the pros:\n- The game is free to play and got the payment system implemented in a nice way. you can buy gold (rather low price compared to other F2P games) to get cards quicker or to buy avatars. Except for those Avatars everything else you need can be aquired by the ingame currency (the silver coins).\n- The game really is a real time strategy game. It is fun once you understand it and there are multiple strategies that work out fine - well, if your opponent doesn't counter them that is ^^\n- While grinding silver coins for upgrades and unlocks, you randomly get cards for battles. This makes it quite attractive to battle - also, battles are the best way to learn the game except:\n- the chat - there are quite some players who'll help you if you have questions or need advice - well, there are also those who just scream how they can't get a grip on the game or how they get steamrolled. If that happens to you, just ask how you could improve and most players will answer - noobbashing is no fun anyhow ;)\n- the graphics are easy on the eye .\n- Ediths comment: As you can see in the comments here, the devs are quite active and take players seriously. THAT is a definite plus.\n\nI'd recommend it for everyone. As a single battle doesn't take long you can't go wrong trying it - and don't get frustrated by the "tutorial" - and don't worry about the cards you start with - atm my strategy is pumping out hedgehogs (one of the starters) while upgrading the smithy to give my creatures one more damage for each other creature I got. Hedgehogs give +2 damage to every other hedgehog in battle =3","January 30","true","2.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

However, after almost 2 hours of playing, I have yet to win a single battle. It seems that until you have played and leveled up, you have no chance of winning. The system also does not seem to match you based on level or playtime either, it just randomly picks an oppenent. On top of this, there is minimal strategy to playing other than picking the most effective units. so it basically boils down to who has played longer, leveled their characters, leveled their minions, unlocked the most deck slots, etc. Really not much fun due to the obvious issues. A few changes could make this game truly awesome, but I dont think the devs really care at this point, as im sure this was intended to be a quick money grab game.","November 3, 2015","false","1.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It now is possible to have matches with other people without encountering heavy bugs.\nThere are still a lot of minor bugs to be worked on, but for a first impression of the gameplay, it is fine as for right now.\n\nMatchmaking seems also quite smooth now. Sometimes the game would not really respond similar to a disconnect but it's just a major desync when trying to find a match.\nBut that's still one of the small bugs on here.\n\nCards are really obtained after most matches. Here I've won 8 matches in a row and got 4 new cards out of it.\nSometimes you may get the same card twice but you can simply sell it and get a few of those silver coins. I believe the purpose for them as for now is to buy another card slot to take one more card with you in battle and upgrading a current card.\n\nAbout the chat I am very disappointed.\nMajority is talking in russian. If it's not for those russians then there are other people spamming the chat with their own language.\nSince this game seems to have players from everywhere, everybody should use english instead.\nAnd some really do tho!\n\nIt is free to play so you won't lose anything on it. The in-game Shop is for paid currency only.\nSo you got to pay for faster leveling and more money gain.\nThat's a standard free to play model. And it seems that you can also get few of these real money currency after leveling up. For example I got around 30 when I turned level 6.\n\nUpgrading cards can be done with either paid or legit currency as well as buying the new card slots.\n\nThere seems to be no item which let's you win easier or such.\n\n\n\nStatement:\n\nIF the developers continue to work a bit more on the game, refine the edges and smoothen the gameplay even more to fix even the small bugs, THEN I would recommend this game, since it is free to play and really not pay to win as well as it's kind of fun to play a few matches.","September 16, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thats beside the point. Firstly, all of the gripers of pay to win, yeah just look at this and change it in your mind to, "Im a little kid who can't win so obviously this game is a pay to win piece of crap." That isnt true. I will grant it, the tutorial was kind of a piece of crap. I played my first game, didnt know what anything was really, lost. Second game, I learned from the first one what everything was, played (there is a keyword coming up here) STRATEGICALLY and won. Simple as that. Be smarter than your opponent. Yes you can pay with real money to get cards, but you get them just as easily by (what's our keyword of the day? YOu GOT IT) STRATEGICALLY winning games or by the in game money you get from winning to buy random cards. Matchmaking? Really was not bad for me at all. So, yes, i do highly approve this game and recommend it, IF you consider yourself a strategic person and would like to give it a try. It is fun, short, and easy to pick up. I feel as though im forgetting to mention something, but oh well 10/10 will be playing another round soon.","September 1, 2015","true","2.3"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","0"

My first impressions of this game are boring, the music is dry and its not catchy at all just bland. The graphics are meh not much about that. This game is easy and after taking a look at the store and at all the crap you can buy, I have come to a conclusion that this game is pay to win. This is no big surprise to me since well its a mobile port and that it is free to play. I can respect free to play games if the items are purely cosmetic or can be gained rather than be obtained by money spamming. Most mmos do this you have your little vanity items which only make your character look better, this in my opinion makes sense, the devs have to make some revenue off of this game to stay alive and to continue to develop this game. What I hate about free to play games, is money spammers, aka people who have enough money on their phones or steam to literally pay for anything anytime. This is completely unfair to the people who expect to have a experience where they feel that to win or have a chance of winning in this game you have to pay money. Other bits I would like to not is glitches, from 13 minutes I have experienced 1 glitch that makes it harder to navigate the menus and actually configure the game. I don't really know how this occured, I was taking a look at the settings and clicked through the graphics qualities and suddenly my game screen decided it wanted to be amazing small, I then tried to unclick the windowed mode which was succesful but then had the selection of a button like 2 boxes away from where my mouse was. This game has way to many bugs and things they need to work out before they can call this a "Released Game" this should be in early access. My overall review would be a low 3/10 for bland music, glitches, and pay to win nonsense.","August 30, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There’s only 2-3 people playing (the game is multiplayer only), game content is extremely basic and the Steam forums are dead.\n\nThe game is almost like a proof of concept, vertical slice, early access build. The graphics are charming, and the foundation is reasonably solid, but other than that it’s hard to justify spending more than 30 minutes here. At least it’s free?\n\nI’ll admit that I’ve played for a bit more than 30 minutes. This is largely because I picked up ‘Koshey’ in the one starter pack I was able to purchase with my ounce of free newbie gold. Koshey is known to be over powered and, what can I say, I do like winning so that’s kept me going. I have only lost one game rushing straight to level 10 and 2000 shields. (Shields are what passes for the game’s ranking system with a 2000 shield max (highest) rank.)\n\nThe game itself is extremely simple. Build some basic resource producing buildings (‘rooms’ in a house), ramp up production to build units, then send these units one by one towards the centre of the 2D, single-plane map.  The front unit from each player then proceeds to beat the snot out of the front unit of the other player until one player is ground back to their base and defeat.\n\nOf note, the game desperately wants you to spend money, but seriously, on what? I can’t say, personally, because despite my winning streak I still haven’t earned enough in-game coinage to splurge on a single extra pack.\n\nThere are occasional card drops after winning a game but these are pretty stingy too – perhaps one card drop per five games or so, most of which were duplicates of cards I already had. This shouldn’t be surprising since the card pool seems tiny. Well, I guess, how much diversity can there be in lining up creatures @rse to toe in a conga line?\n\nIn a sense, there’s nothing wrong with giving this game a whirl for a few minutes. It’s free to play, after all.

I try to keep it as unbiased as possible, and that's rather easy considering I'm not a game developer fanboy. Keep in mind that this game is in Early Access at the time of the posting of this review and that things are most certainly subject to change. So, let's start out with the big bad wolf. The chief complaint people seem to have in this game. Pay to Win.\n\nSo, without further ado, let's go BallsDeep in this game.\n\nThe Business Model: Is it Pay to Win?\n\nEverybody in the review section seems to be up and arms about how this game is Pay to Win. I decided, soley based on that theory, to download the game and play with it for a little while. Lo' and behold I came across my own pesonal decision on whether or not Heroes of Scene is P2W afterall. But I won't just give you what I think on the matter. I'm going to inform you properly with why I think what I do. So let's take a look at the business model, shall we?\n\nIs there a cash shop? Yes, there is. Is this the devil? No, it's not. This is what you can buy in the cash shop. A premium membership with premium currency (buttons) for whatever time you select. This gives you double experience and money accumulation. You can buy some light cosmetics. This is just for your portrait. There's no way to get that with the earned currency, either. You can buy a random hero card or random spell card with premium currency. You can buy a new deck slot with premium currency, but also earned currency. You can also level up your hero and spell cards with both currencies however those cards still need to have the required experience before you can do so. You can also buy a new card slot (to fit more cards into your decks) for premium and earned currency, but must reach a certain level before you can even see the prices of that.\n\nSo, now that we know all (unless I missed something) of what you can buy in this game with real money / premium currency we can begin to answer the question "Is Heroes of Scene Pay to Win?".\n\nMy answer is no, it's not pay to win. Admittedly there is one thing that does at least seem to be pay to win - and that's the ability to buy a random card. It's pay to advance more quickly, and that's it. While a good deck will usually beat a noob's deck, that's to be expected. People who buy into the game will keep winning until they get to the ranking that is within their skill group. If you lose to some crazy "Over Powered" heroes or spells that you've never seen before it's because you don't know how to counter that card, have nothing to counter it (due to your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ noob deck kekekekek), and/or matchmaking ♥♥♥♥ed you. However I find that matchmaking is done fairly well and most of my games aren't complete roflstomps either way.\n\nGraphics and Art\n\nGraphically and artfully this game is very well done and very polished. It's a very pleasing, light hearted style that's easy on the eyes. I enjoy the visuals greatly. The HUDs, GUIs, and Menu's are all done very, very well. To me it looks as if they would have texture, which is a pleasant thing to look at. While it's leaning towards a slightly more cartoony artstyle, that takes nothing away and only adds onto the theme of the game - which is toy/puppet battles. Furthermore, the Robot looks like bender. Easter Egg anyone?\n\nOverall, no complaints about the graphics in the slightest. My computer runs these visuals just fine and there's no stuttering even when I've spammed two dozen hedgehogs on my enemies. Heheh...poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s...\n\nSounds and Music\n\nThe game sounds great. There are sound effects for everything in the game that needs sound effects and none of them get tiring over a long play period or are annoying in the first place. Sometimes I can be a little confused by some of the sound cues happening in a different part of the map I'm in, but other than that they're wonderful.\n\nThe music is light hearted and well composed. I never found myself needing to turn it down or off. It's nice to listen to as you set up your base and send your hoards of hedgehogs to destroy your enemies. It's a nice backing sound with different highs and lows here and there.\n\nThere is one problem where when a track ends there's a pause for a few seconds or so before it starts again which is annoying however I believe that's simply a bug.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay is superb. Everything feels responsive, as it should. The matchmaking works similarly to clash of clans, where it operates on a "Win a match get some rank points, lose one you lose rank points!" and it works well for it's purposes. The building is mostly instantaneous. You aren't often waiting for somethign to happen as you always have something to do. Build your base up, build your army, raid with hedgehogs, whatever floats your boat. You can build two buildings that offer upgrades to various buildings and stats and none of them feel useless. This adds to the strategies you can go with in a game. The matches are fast paced, as advertised. Most don't pass 15 minutes in length.\n\nYour heroes and spell cards gain experience as you use them in matches. Once the experience bar fills up you can, outside of a match, upgrade them with either premium or earned currency. Trying to figure out a deck after you get a few more cards is fairly entertaining and engaging. Testing them out is also fun. Set up your peices and knock your opponents down, or snort as your trash-tier set up gets rofl-stomped by the enemy and say "Well that was ♥♥♥♥!"\n\nFurthermore, the gameplay is easy to navigate. You only really need your mouse to play this game. So the controls are simple as can be.\n\nCommunity\n\nThere isn't a whole lot to say about the community. I haven't tried going to the forums as of yet, so this is just referring to the community in game. There's a global chat in the main screen which people use. Most of the people who speak in that chat seem to only speak russian. Some English speakers do speak there but it's usually to ask for help or to answer questions.\n\nI'd really like to see the ability to chat to your opponent in match or at least in the lobby. This is supposed to be a multiplayer game and it makes it feel like the opponent is just a computer. That's not the case, though, considering you get some really skilled players and then you get the "Lol what are you doing noob?" players who don't know what's going on and are probably high off their ♥♥♥ or something.\n\nSo, like I said, there isn't a whole lot to say about the community.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThis game is casual friendly as well as hardcore. There are ways to be skilled in this game. People will be encouraged to think of strategies to beat their opponents. You don't get angry when you lose since you only poured at most 15 minutes of your life into any given match in most cases, so the sting of losing is dull at worst and I find is usually nonexistent.\n\nI definitely recommend this game. It doesn't take a lot of time, but I think you'll spend a fair amount of it playing anyway. It's fast paced, interesting, unique, and most importantly fun!\n\nAlso, Bender is in this game. I'm almost certain the Robot hero is a reference to Bender from Futurama. Hats off to the Devs on that one. Bender will forever be in my deck.\n\nAnd yes, I would definitely go BallsDeep into this game again. A solid 9/10 inches.","August 29, 2015","true","25.3"," 19 of 46 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","19","46","2","2"

It seems it would be more "Pay to get Ahead Faster".  And that is up to the user I guess.\n\nAs far as is it any good?  I like it actually.  It has a tower defense sort of feel, and reminds me of a side scroller Tower Wars in some ways.  Except you aren't placing any towers, but the phase where you send out waves to attack the enemy aspect is here.  I would say matchmaking is a mixed bag, as you might play against players that have more experience, but you still would get a new random player.\n\nBeing this review is on launch day, there were a few issues with the server.  A couple restarts here and there, and currently the match making server is down.  But there is the ability to play against the AI.  So if you want to practice, that is possible, and when the servers are working, the match making is fun, depending on if you learn fast.\n\nPart of how the game works, is there is strategy and it seems the more you play you can refine your build orders and unit launch timings and support spells in a manner that compliments your play style.  As for me, I found 5 cards that I have a strategy for that I won't reveal here, I might post a guide later.  But being the game is free to play, it's worth at least checking out.  But remember it's new so the match making server COULD be down, but if its up you will be having fun.  Don't be afraid to play against the AI for a dozen games to get the hang of everything.  You will get rewards including cards for playing agains the AI as well as PvP so just PLAY the game and you get better.  Mainly because you get new cards and learn new strategies used against you by your opponent.\n\nTL:DR - It's fun, its not really pay to win, it's pay to get ahead faster.  There is PvP and AI matches, and it's free, it's worth a quick download.\n\nRating 7/10 -   This could go higher as they iron out the bugs and flesh out the new features.  They are working on the game currently.  I just noticed a server reset, so I suspect they fixed the match making error.  Off to keep playing.","August 26, 2015","true","12.5"," 16 of 41 people (39%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","39","16","41","4","0"
