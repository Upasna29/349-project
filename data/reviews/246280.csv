A war between two castles. Three classes (Warrior, Cleric and Mage). Leveling up characters and equipments. Building respawn towers. Having fun.\nThe graphics are kind of childish and the game is light, and that's good. It's a game for all ages.\n\nThere isn't much to tell about the game. It's as simple as it looks like, and it's incredibly enjoyable.\n\nThe main mode is the multiplayer mode. There is PvP for at least 6 players (up to 30), and there is the Co-Op mode (playing against bots) for at least 8 players.\n\nThere is also the single-player mode, with story mode, tutorials and the skirmish mode (the same as multiplayer, but only with bots).\n\nThe game is the same, but a PC port brings new possibilities.\n\nBesides being able to play it using keyboard+mouse and also using a gamepad, adding players is way faster than on Xbox, and having a faster text chat helps a lot.\n\nThis game is not a pay-to-win. You're not forced to play against high-leveled people, and they won't charge you for accessing any part of the game. But of course there is some cool stuff you can get by using real money, such as better chances of getting good equipments, using it to improve equipments instead of using game money, unlocking the evolved classes faster and buying items.\n\nThat's one of my favorite free-to-play games, I'd recommend this to anyone who likes RPG, war games, magic games or even MOBA.\n\nPlay it! It's free! Have nice fun!","November 23, 2015","true","42.6"," 97 of 110 people (88%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","88","97","110","14","3"

It is a mediocre port locked at 30fps. There is no communication in lobbies or in matches, except for the small commands in matches, which do not really matter at all because they are constantly spammed, making them serve barely any purpose at all.\n\nThe visual style is both charming and gorgeous, and the gameplay is fun and addicting, but it is all the other negative factors that pulls my verdict for the game down.\n\nThere are no official servers or support for community servers, the game is 100% peer to peer. You are often tossed in matches with people from the other side of the globe, then kicked out in the middle of the match because either  A. The match was ended because there are too few players to actually countinue(everyone else has been disconnected), or B. You have lost connection to the other peers.\n\nEDIT: A small point that I left out was the microtransactions present in Happy Wars. Certain items are pay2win only, but most of the items are available through luck and grinding, as expected for a f2p title. The happy tickets (Happy War's premium currency) can be used to get easier access to equipment or to make progress on certain quest. For some, premium players might seem overpowered for some, but it all depends on how well you play, not just you, but you and your team.\n\nEDIT: In Happy Wars, each basic class possesses one archtype (advanced class), which are unlocked through the various quests in the game. The quests consist of for the most part of "doing this" or "kill x amount of that", again, more grinding. As I mentioned earlier, Happy Tickets can be used to make progress on certain quests, giving premium players easier access to the archtypes.\n\nThe community is also rather dull and the developers are barely communicating/and or listening to the players. I expressed my thoughts on the lack of servers a while back and ended up getting my comment removed.\n\nTL;DR\nPros\n+Gorgeous visual style\n+Good soundtrack\n+Addictive and fun gameplay\n\nCons\n-Horrible matchmaking\n-Locked framerate(locked at 30)\n-Lack of communication both in matches and in lobbies\n-The game gets somewhat repetetive after X amount of hours\n-No sign of the developers actually communicating with the players\n-Somewhat p2w\n\n5.5/10\n\nEDIT: For those who are rating this review down, please leave a comment and tell me why, I want to hear your opinions. General feedback is also much appreciated.","October 25, 2014","false","61.6"," 297 of 403 people (74%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","74","297","403","29","16"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/recommended/246280/","YouthOfFreedom","+ Youth Of Freedom +","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/","42 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHappy Wars is originally an Xbox Live exclusive games and now being ported to the PC. This game is a mixture of third person hack & slash with some little MOBA element into it. Is it a really good game ? Let see.\n\nGAMEPLAY : 9/10\n\nThe game support total of 30 player with 15 on each side making it a chotic battle. This game is basically a tower defense type of game.\n\nYou have three class you can choose. A Warrior,Cleric & Mage. They also have an advanced class which is Berserker,Engineer & Zephyr Each of them have their own unique spells & skills. You even able to customize your own character by choosing a bunch of presets ( it doesn't provide a deep customization but at least it there )\n\nThe tutorial present to you is fairly well done explaining most of the basic & advanced things you need to know about the game mechanics.\n\nYou able to build a bunch of artillery to help defend your castle. Tower are also scattered throughout the area. Build them and you can respawn from over there without you having to walk from your castle to your enemy territory.\n\nAs you level up,you gain different type of skills and spells for you to choose. Sometimes it randomly give you a spell that you don't frequently use.\n\nAs far as i know there is no chat system,you only able to use command key.\n\nYou are not able to rebind your key either so that a troublesome for those who don't like the default key.\n\nGRAPHICS : 9/10\n\nThe cartoony artsyle and visual appeal to me a lot.\n\nThere is a lot of colorful background and environment especially the coral stage where you can see bunch of fish swimming around.\n\nCharacter models felt bland but it acceptable nonetheless.\n\nInterface is neatly done as well as some of the particle.\n\nEach stages just look amazing,offering different variety of environment and background.\n\nAUDIO : 9.5/10\n\nSound effects wise.....is very good and those cute chibi voice that your character makes i find it pretty funny.\n\nHowever the strongest point is the soundtrack.\n\nEven though there is only 9 soundtrack in the game,all of it are phenomenal. Most of the stages have orchestral theme in it.\n\nYou can try listen at here : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5aE2-NvNJXOpOsTJCO3WfOepGjAgtXmR\n\nLONG-LASTING APPEAL : 9/10\n\nDoing chaotic battles never get old especially this game provide a lot of content. You able to upgrade and buff your equipment. You able to gain rewards too as you finish each battle.\n\nThere is a Heavy Spinner mode where you place 3 maximum bets on the items you want ( each bets cost 300 stars,placing more bets giving you higher chance to earn random items ). If you lucky you can earn rare items.\n\nThere is Happy Cards mode where you use 18 happy tickets ( which you can purchase using real cash ) to gain 2 common items and 1 premium items. If you are super lucky you can get super premium items !!!\n\nThe game provide Mission mode too,it basically a task which you must complete in order to earn different type of rewards. As you finish the mission that you are given,new mission are present to you.\n\nSkrimish mode is extremely fun and never get old.\n\nMultiplayer mode is also fun to play with online player. Though you can't communicate,the commands button is a nice touch at least. The matchmaking is not really that good either since you can paired up with players that have ten times way better equipment than you.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 9.1/10\n\nI highly recommend you check this game out especially to those who like tower defense game.\n\nThis game offer different type of gameplay mechanics that many tower defense doesn't and it fresh to see something new. It an absolute blast to play even if you play by yourself. Updates is also constant which always introduced new content and fix some major bugs.\n\nGRADE : A ( Excellent )","May 28, 2014","true","1.7"," 230 of 318 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","230","318","0","2"

Doesn't matter how good your net is you will lag and your hits won't register\n- Loading time takes forever\n- Unrealiable servers. You will disconnected for no reason\n- In my experience finding matches takes a while. Either there isn't enough people to start a match (so you have to reset every 30 seconds to see if anyone else wants to come in OR they get disconnected)\n- Usually unbalanced ( For example, my last match: 8 people in game. 3 1 stars on my team, 4 people with over 1000 hours on the other = we lost instantly).

So is this game worth to try? YES!!!\n\nBefore I decide to invest my time in a game, what i usually do is to read only the negative reviews in the sea of positives. If i can tolerate what is negative about the game, i will go ahead to try it.\n\nMy experience as a newbie was fun and comical. Early in my low levels, i randomly obtained a decent fishbone sword and an awesome seashell as my shield and that sealed my fate as a Warrior major (btw u can switch classes in the middle of battle much like Battlefield 3). Later, i realized it was so much fun hacking those pesky mages.\n\nThe gameplay is like a cross between DOTA + Battlefield 3 + Rakion (+ KongKong Online for the artstyle). Not only u need to be a good combatant, u need to have good situational/strategic awareness and know where u will be most useful. U also get 1 free random gear per match, and you can upgrade/tweak ur equipment with non-cash currency called Happy Stars that u earn after every battle.\n\nThere are not many connection/lag problems, things go rather smoothly but you do have to wait like 20-80 secs to get a match going. Regarding the claim that u will get thrown into the game with loads of people higher level than u or much better equipment than u, its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t/outdated. When i play, the teams are usually balanced and high levels are spread out on both teams. As a freebie player, i am able to contribute significantly to my team and even get MVP. So is it pay2win? Not for the first 20+ levels i can say for sure, however i am not sure for higher levels. In all, my journey thus far was just HAPPY WARRING!","February 13, 2015","true","201.4"," 90 of 116 people (78%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","78","90","116","31","2"

As you gain land you are able to build catapults to invade the enemy's fortress. There's three classes Warrior, Mage, and Cleric. I believe Item drops are random after every match.You gain class by killing/winning, weapon xp by killing, and point by winning. These points can be use to purchase new gear for the classes. Game is played in a third person perspective, and wasd with the hack and slash feel to it. Really fun game totalz recommendz.  Reminds me of Fat Princess. This game is a good alternative to FP.

Wow I'm already out of words here have some bullets\n\nThe Good\n\n* Team-based gameplay ensures the fact that players need to rely on each other to win. Your teammates watch your back, heal it if necessary and are all but essential in pushing towards the enemy castle. You might have the best gear, but getting ganged up on by 4 people while you're all alone spells your death.\n\n* A large assortment of gear ensures variety within builds. You might get the same item twice, and that's fine because there's a lot of things you can do with them besides let them collect dust. Transfer buffs, sell it for cash, use it as level-up material, the entire system is pretty smooth and effective. That, and beating people to death with magic flowers always warms the heart.\n\n* Daily log-in rewards ensure that the player isn't always completely broke. Everyday you get some pocket change to use for various item modification purposes (or the spinner if you have a gambling problem) and after a while, a premium item. Pretty generous deal for just opening up the game.\n\n* Its actually free to play. It's completely possible to find powerful gear just by playing the game, and I only bought a DLC pack to have some auxiliary weapons and armor. The kicker? Some of the stuff I already had was stronger than it. Ho ho, take that Mabinogi and Maple Story and shove it back into the cellar, troglodyte.\n\nThe Bad\n\n* The game is a bit of a grindfest. Want to equip powerful items? Need to keep ranking up to increase your weight capacity. Want to unlock story missions? Need to keep ranking up. Want to find better stuff that isn't a twig with a smiley face? Rank. Up.\n\n* Matchmaking is a bit shoddy. Sometimes, you'll be matched up with people weaker or on par with you. Alrighty then, fair game. Other times? Say hello to that player with an axe made of tears and fire, with more buffs than your fingers can count. All they need to do is BREATHE on you and you'll be atomically rearranged. This is really the most glaring issue of the game so far, and it is NOT helped by the small playerbase.\n\n* Lag. The game runs smoothly most of the time, but sooner or later you'll find that one guy who won't die, lag teleports and still hits you. How bad could it get? The towers and timer stopped functioning in a round I had once, stuck on zero with no way to gain or lose tower control. After a random and chaotic few minutes, the round ended.\n\n* You spend an uncomfortably long amount of time looking at the stats page after a round. This is a minor gripe, but what am I going to do with 30 seconds and nothing but TABLES.\n\n\nOverall, this game is good. The positives outweigh the negatives immensely, and the game is free. Free. And easy to pick up. Go ahead, bolster the playerbase. See if I care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaka.","May 31, 2015","true","47.2"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","78","29","37","9","0"

As much as I like the game's concept, I personally can't recommend this game to any average player. Even if you played this on xbox 360 or one, still wouldnt recommend trying the pc version.\n\nPros:\n\n- Though you can pay for more customizations, the game starts you off a lot of characteristics you can make your avatar.\n\n- You are given 3 slots per class to customize with for looks as well as strategy reasons.\n\n- Straight forward game and objective easy to pick up on.\n\nCons:\n\n- Don't expect the "servers" to not disconnect you before, during, or after any of your match in Coop, Quick match, and even Private match. If you have a bad connection, do not bother trying to play online here.\n\n- The way you obtain items is by luck via spinner or random card after spending tickets (which you can earn to a certain point until you have pay money for them) and free passes (again, given till a certain point till you got to do league).\n\n- The game suffers from sync issues. (On your screen you'll see yourself hitting your enemy but you really never see any reaction or lost of HP).\n\n- Just I said in 2nd, the game items is luck based, but there are people who spend tons of cash on this game making them hard to kill, which make this game heavy on pay2win.\n\n- No way of communication to your teammates in-game. This becomes and issue if you don't have any friends on Happy wars to type to about defending, needing help, or even letting them know what you're gonna do.\n\n- Balancing of maps. Some maps are completely unfair or gives an advantage to one side than the other.\n\n- Buffs that are op with no counters.\n\n- LONG WAIT TIMES FOR MATCHES. The community has indeed gotten smaller and smaller making it hard to get a match going in coop and quick match. It also doesn't help that parties in Quick match can make the wait process even longer since the game tries to balance the party and everyone who is going solo.\n\n- The game's balancing system. This game when it comes to Quick matches makes the stranges choices of which players go on which team and who allowed in the match. You have chances of being stuck with a team of newcomers against a team that have only higher ranks.\n\n- Broken tactics. Unless you're playing with friends who are VERY good at the game, you will lose most Quick matches to backdoors. There very little things you can do to someone backdooring if you can't catch them or stop them, unless you get certain buffs, which you need to pay for or get lucky, and skills\n\n- Skills your class can use is entirely lucked based. You have 9 slots, 3 per button skill (A skill, B skil, and team skill), and you are given 2 skills for free. As you lvl up to lvl 5 you open more skills you may use, but you MAY NOT CHOOSE what skills you want. Only way you can guarantee a skill for you to use at the start is buffs that have "Skill name +" on your weapon or armor (which takes up a slot in your items for something more useful to put in).\n\n- YOU CAN GET STUCK IN THE LOADING SCREEN! The wait time in a quick match loading screen can vary but if it's longer than 10 seconds, you will possibly be dc from the match. Normally you woulds say, "I'll just reset the game". That would be ok if your lower league (under rank 30), but in upper leagues you WILL be penalized by lower league points cause you exited the game on the loading screen. League points is needed to obtain rewards for monthly league games.\n\n- Private matches have NO customization of bot number, difficulty, and game types. this game only has a singlular game type, only way you'll play different ones if you and your friends make em up.\n\nIf you are still willing to play the game despite this, all I can say is best of luck in having fun.\n\nOnly reason for this many hours was hopes for a better game and playing with friends, but i barely tolerate it to play no longer than 30 minutes of this nonsense. Do not get hooked by this addiction.","July 3, 2015","false","439.1"," 111 of 182 people (61%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","61","111","182","36","17"

Happy Wars has what i consider one of the best game starter mechanics i've ever seen and unlike some of the other larger game companys (lookin' at you Valve) you dont have to pay-your-way; (this feature may be out of date, sorry if it is) the game starts you off with some free 'tokens' so you can get some weapons and armour (keep in mind its a random item), so you can jump into a game without worrying about some massive brute freight-training his way into you oversized comical skull. But then the game stops you and sais 'oh sorry, you know that really cool helmet that you just found? Yeah you cant wear it'. Yes the item cap is annoying but i found it didnt stop me majorly. Other than these unherd of free-to-play tactics its kind of a generic third person fighting game, but id recomment it if you'd like a well balanced game filled to the brim with comic humor.","October 15, 2015","true","24.1"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","19","24","5","3"

For some reason or another the ai can stun a player with every little touch while the player is barely allowed to do damage even when using an over powered weapon and slashing at the enemy's back. I haven't been able to find half the maps in game that are shown which just ticks me off. Another issue is some of the skills are supposed to have a duration, half the time those just stop instantly for no reason and leave the player open to attack. By no reason I mean no reason, didn't get hit, didn't fall off a ledge, didn't hit a wall, nothing. The only way to win is to flat out zerg rush in and sometimes that only backfires because some things on the feild like the bombs don't go at the enemy. Infact they seem to have some delay that the ai can use to kick the bombs at you WITHOUT a delay. Now for the good, when you do zerg rush and win it gets addictive. That's the only good thing I can think of. The weapons and customization are nice but they aren't exactly enough for me to sing praises. The worst part though, for me, is the delay on the start! Even though my online connection is always 4 or 5 bars, I spawn in last and I have to wait additional time before I can leave the castle. People who spawn in after me are allowed to go but I can't until every other player and the ai has gotten a 30 secod head start on me.

There is much map variety, along with customizable characters, Literally hundreds of different sets of weapons and armor to choose from for either your warrior, berserker, cleric, engineer, mage, Or Zepyhr. You can pay microtransactions for "happy tickets" To eadily ride to premium weapons. Premium weapons, however, are not a ride to victory. Skill is one true factor in this game. If you have skill, You can destroy. Happy tickets are not the only currency in this game. There are happy stars, which you get from selling items you earned in a game, or directly from a game. YOu can use happy stars on the happy spinner to get gear. So far I have a super premium from just the spinner.The game's graphical style is unaging. The game is behind Xbox One and Xbox 360, and is currently in Season 2.

I don't like the item packs they have in the marketplace, which allow new players to become high levels with one purchase of a pack(xbox version), it makes me feel like its a pay to win, but they do balance it out with their spinner, which allows non-pay to win players to obtain a super rare weapon or armor/item.\n\nNow the PC version, which is still in beta.\n\nThey still have bugs and issues, and also a poor server performance record.

Your connection may drop a LOT. Even if you have decent internet and do not have connectivity issues with other games. This can occur when preparing to queue, or even while in game. You may find yourself playing a game for 10+ minutes and then disconnecting at the very end, denying you your rewards and losing league (ranking) points if it happens.\n\n2. Matchmaking queues will not be close to balanced. More often than not, you will either stomp a mudhole in your enemy team's posterior, or you will meet a similar fate.\n\n3. There is no in game text or audio communication. You will be limited to a set of pre constructed messages that will have very little to do with what you want to happen.\n\n4. Some team mates will do things that can and will sabotage your game and there will be nothing you can do about it. (Such as convince the bots to help them cast a spell that will take too long, thus preventing the team from getting to the tower construction zones quickly.)\n\n5. Sometimes as a cleric, when you cast the "summon materials" spell at the appropriate location, the materials will fail to spawn.\n\n6. The happy spinner is only useful at lower levels, when you don't even really have a lot of happy stars to begin with. At higher levels (20+, 31+), it becomes decreasingly useful, not compensating for the amount of happy stars you get.\n---\nNow to be fair, I have to give Happy Wars its props.\n\n1. It's free to play. You don't have to buy anything, you can earn everything. It's just more difficult that way.\n\n2. It's beautifully rendered.\n\n3. Each class feels useful in their own right. There is no one class that dominates each other class hand over fist.\n\n4. Even when losing and all hope seems lost, you can turn the tide if you can get people smart enough to use Happy Miracle.\n\n5. If you are not strong enough to deal/tank damage, you can still be useful by utility, such as healing, summoning building resources to construct weapons and build walls to block enemies,  and cast ultimate moves, which draw upon the power of your entire team.\n\nWhen happy wars fixes its glitches, it'll be a wonderful game. But until then, it's more of a headache than anything else. Thankfully it's Free.\n\nTL:DR AWESOME POTENTIAL, BUT YOU WILL SUFFER A TON OF GLITCHES. WILL GIVE GAME THUMBS UP AFTER SOME GLITCHES GO AWAY.","June 14, 2014","false","81.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I think this might be one of the few games that I've really enjoyed fighting with a team, and not caring either winning or losing. It's entertaining in a playful way, as it looks silly as all hell.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I ended up being discouraged with alot of games people recommend for me, TF2 being one of them. And Happy Wars, being a personally fun game, really makes me enjoy battling with others, because I feel like I'm actually improving, skillwise, and stat-wise. It's a little monotinous, but it's quite satisfying and relaxing, and very comically funny.\n\nMost enjoyable part, is that it actually feels like I'm GETTING SOMEWHERE, if I keep playing! It randomly gives you weapons and armor, regardless of whether you're good or bad, and get even better equipment if you do better within the match yourself! K/D ratio? Nah, none of that, just do good overall. And like most Rpg games, you can upgrade your equipment to make them more useful in battle. And it's not randomly determined whether you get an item or not, only what sort of item that you get. So it's not pure RNG oriented. Of course if you like splurging, you can buy better stuff. Not that it's really needed in this game, really. It's simply an option, and not coercion.\n\nHowever, it isn't fleshed out that much, and the amount of maps to play in are a bit....limited, I'll admit. It looks far too silly for anyone that wants a challenge, and for that, I think that's fine. More of a chance for it to being a special gem for those that are interested. The Lottery Wheel itself, is just pretty much a gamble with your happy stars for equipment, but you'll more than likely get something useful. If not, it has it's uses in another field, so don't be too quick to get rid of it. Match-making isn't all that great either, but at least it's able to rank players appropriately, based on how much they play, or how high their level is. So if you know there's someone that's been on it for years, and pretty much knows everything you don't, you can back out before the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ commences. And that's always a plus in my book.\n\n(What? Ain't no-one paying me to go above and beyond in a video-game. Only in Tournaments, which is why I stick to fighting games for that.)\n\nThis is just my two cents in this game, and there's alot more, but I'm not inclined that much to actually give you too much. You got a brain. Decide for yourself if you want to try it. All I can do is give you is suggest.","March 19","true","39.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Each player selects from a number of roles - 3 at the game's beginning (Warrior, Cleric, and Mage), but I believe more can be unlocked over time - with each role possessing a set of special attributes, skills, and strengths.\n\nThe combat itself is simple to control:  left-click to hack & slash, right-click to shield/defend, and the use of the space bar and/or number keys to select from a variety of special attacks, defenses, spells, and more.  Also, while left-clicking will control your player's primary attack, repeated clicking will develop his or her swordplay into a variety of hacking, slashing, thrusting, and rushing, thereby keeping the action diverse and enjoyable.\n\nBecause, at its core, the game requires only a few keys and buttons, this is a game that adults and children can enjoy equally and easily.  I'm an adult myself who normally tends toward darker, "heavier" titles, and I've found myself absolutely loving Happy Wars regardless.\n\nThe game modes range from online multiplayer battles with up to 30 people playing simultaneously, to online co-operative battles against a computer-controlled team, to single player offline battles with computer-controlled teammates and enemies, to single-player missions which reward players with items and abilities, to a training/skirmish mode that will prepare you for battle.  While in most games I tend toward playing online multiplayer, enjoying the fact that I'm playing with real, human teammates and opponents from around the globe, the single-player options for Happy Wars are actually great fun as well, and I've already found myself returning to them, having just as much fun playing on my own.\n\nThe range of items, power-ups, weapons, shields, character skins, etc., will keep even the most item-crazy gamers well-satisfied.  The amount of attributes, spells, and leveling rewards are huge - and great fun to achieve.  After my first battle I found myself having gained the ability to use a "fried newt" as a new, more powerful version of a sword - which I promptly equipped my player with (who is already wearing an upside-down tin bucket as a helmet on his head).  In my second battle I found myself repeatedly strengthened by a mage teammate's spells, which turned me briefly into a small milk carton (decorated on its side with an image of a cow with a nose ring), thereby providing a greater armored defense from enemy attacks.\n\nThis game is great, great fun, and I'd happily recommend it to anyone.","July 10, 2014","true","1.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I played the XBox version during the 1st two months it came out and never have experienced Pay2Win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like this. Seeing how people always seem to have more money on Steam ruins this game.\n\nLiterally everyone I played against online 1 hits me with their weapon at the START of the match. Some people even are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and die on purpose so then they can spend their stars/tickets on getting all 9 abilities instantly and being Lv.4 right away. There seems to be no Team Balance seeing how they put 5 newbies on my team (including me) and 4 P2W high levels on the other team with 2 P2W newbies. Literally just rushed us and won in about 30 seconds flat.\n\nHigh Level players who are Pay2Win are literally near invincible. They 1 shot you while you spend 20 seconds swinging at them to have them not even die. You literally need a team just to kill this 1 person. If they have a cleric healing them, then good luck with that ♥♥♥♥.\n\nEven new Pay2Win players have the ability to literally unequip everything except a high-damage 1 shot kill weapon. They actually die unlike P2W High Levels, but they're still nuisances since they kill you in one hit. With all the kills they acquire, they'll quickly be able to level up and equip all their P2W equipment and become another near invincible player.\n\nIn Conclusion, this game is NOT NEW PLAYER FRIENDLY. It is very high on the Pay2Win meter and you will literally spend hours playing until you can finally get ♥♥♥♥ tier equipment that will make you go from dying in 1 hit to 2 hits and actually be able to equip it all and not just 1 or 2 pieces. They give you 100 Happy Tickets so you can buy booster packs for good weapons or armor, but it doesn't even matter since the good ♥♥♥♥ requires a lot of inventory weight, so you'll have to sacrifice armor for a good weapon and vice versa until you reach a high enough level to support all the weight. If it wasn't for the fact that the Steam version was so high on the Pay2Win meter, this game would actually be a good and fun game to play, like my experience with the XBox version, but the Steam version is just complete and utter garbage.","July 4, 2014","false","2.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

One on one battles are incredibly tense with both players utilizing unique skills (dependent on class), traps, and the environment to get the edge on your opponent. All of the skills feel very well balanced and I rarely feel like I lost and encounter because of a cheap move. The maps are the perfect size to keep the action flowing. Alternate paths add a layer of strategy to the game which I was not expecting, there is nothing better than being in the last minute of a game losing two towers to one and sneaking behind for the cheeky victory. A problem with this however is that a team of people partying together can easily stomp on un-organised teams (although this might be an advantage depending on the amount of friends you have). I have seen many complaining about the pay to play/play to win aspects of this game although in my time playing completely f2p I have only experienced a couple of sessions where people would destroying my entire team due to bought equipment, although these people where very high level with 80+ hours of play time. Getting decent equipment is not difficult and if you focus on the mission mode you should have good enough equipment to stay competitive with players with full premium gear. You may even find yourself besting p2ps easily if you are more strategic with your item modifications.\n\nOverall happy wars is a fantastically designed game which doesn’t need fancy graphics to be incredibly enjoyable no matter what you skill level. If you're looking for a free game to spend endless hours on with friends look no further. Also a quick note I highly recommend using a microsoft xbox controller at least until the keyboard controls are fixed because at the time of writing this they are pants. This game also REQUIRES a FREE xbox live account which may turn some of you of but I implore you to set up a FREE account just to play this game!\n","June 5, 2014","true","79.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Happy Wars features a versatile character customization and you get a unique look in the crowd, as well as being a game that's super friendly and really fun.\n\nI love the sudden events, classes and challenges that come in the game, including Co-op Mode (my favourite). A few downers to the game though is the slow matchmaking system, and the obnoxious payments to participate in something, 18 Happy Tickets for a few items is seriously sadistic, some people may disagree, but that's just my opinion. Regarding the matchmaking system, it's a bit below standard, because of the slow searching but nonetheless, the gameplay is awesome. The game is pretty addicting and as well as the Happy Spinner (a friendly gambling wheel thing). I have played the console version, and started off there and playing it on PC is really good. Easy WASD.\n\nThe game is really rewarding, you get Gear after every match if you do well, and a bunch Happy Stars (lesser currency than Happy Cards) which you can use to upgrade, buy and gamble. There's also mission mode, where there are "quests" that you can complete in order to get rewarded. I love the reward system, but I'd appreciate it if there were more Happy Ticket rewards.\n\nBasically, if you're a Halo player like me, you could say the games a combination of Team Slayer and Territories. It's basically a mixture of a few popular games, PC and Console. It's a heaps good game!

In multiplayer, if you have the proper skills, basically the weapons given to you are good enough. The multiplayer session is a great community that you go against with. You have special abilities in-game which do different things like throw a player off the land or just go together to fight against everyone. Want to grab more weapons? Take the happy spinner which takes your in-game cash you earned during gameplay to grab even more weapons (possibly even cool enchants). Completed missions give you rewards like tickets (tickets were originally purchaseable only, but now they can be received here). With tickets, you can buy things on the store which have even much more cooler weapons or armor or almost ANYTHING! The character customisation is basic and simple, very easy to understand and there's lots to choose from. Monthly, there is always an event which you earn items for completing them. They are either missions or just an enhanced version of matchmaking. And with the updates, the stacks keep rolling and rolling. If you love to enjoy a friendly game with others, and have a little bit of fun, this game is for you.\n\n\nThe only downside I found on this game is the speculations that you need. I never saw a difference with the graphics slider and I always run 10 FPS (even lower with more players). If you have a low-end PC but have an Xbox 360, I would prefer to use the 360 over this.\nI also noticed that none of my items were synced. Basically, the microsoft account is worthless right now in my opinion.","June 23, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With that being said, it is possible to get by without one - as I did for the first week or so of playing.\n\nPros:\n- Simple gameplay that anyone can grasp the basics of in a short amount of time.\n- Balance of classes is very good. There is no truly dominant class.\n- Despite the basics of the game being easy to grasp, there is much room for more experienced players to play at a higher level strategically.\n- You can beat people with better gear than you. Even players who spend $$$ don't always know how to use it.\n- Teamwork is encouraged, and playing with friends will be advantageous and fun.\n- Frequent events and log-in prizes keep up replay value.\n- Good matchmaking system means games are  usually  even and fair.\n\nCons:\n- Ultimately, the game is pay-to-win, and there are some players who are almost unstoppable given their gear. These people are rare however, and shouldn't be encountered at lower levels. Some experienced players (myself included) will 'go easy' on beginners as to not discourage them from sticking with the game. Others will take advantage of new players and kill them mercilessly...\n- LAG! For some reason in this game, when someone is laggy they become near invincible. Unusual, but frustrating.\n\n\nOverall a very casual yet competitive game. You can play as seriously as you want. Co-op mode is great to learn the game mechanics against bots, who come in varying difficulties. You may also make a few friends in here, who you can then play with against real players.\n\nGive it a go, its free after all :)))))))))","May 29, 2015","true","546.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

There’s no creep here, replaced instead by a straight head-to-head 8 to 15-player teams constantly spawning and running into battle. Towers also function rather differently. Instead of actively trying to destroy any towers in their path players are working to build their own, where they can then spawn. Spawning ever closer via towers and/or going straight to the enemies base are both valid strategies.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest change is the simplification of classes. With each respawn, you’ll choose between one of three: The melee-focused Warrior, the healing and support Cleric, and the ranged damage Mage. Each class is fairly simple to play with excellent tutorials for each.\n\nIt speaks to a pleasure as primal as that found in other online mobas even if it's more overtly juvenile: this isn't about bloodlust as such and it's only nominally about a sense of conquest. Predominantly Happy Wars is all about camaraderie like that found in say Mount and Blade or Splatoon.\n\nVoice chat remains off the cards - an omission that's understandable given the desire to provide a safe space to play. The Menu UI is a little in your face with pop-ups galore but its worth pushing through. Its also free-to-play which is great because of how accessible this makes it with little to no monetary investment.\n\nHappy Wars is a machine for happiness where each element, charm, genuinely funny and cute tone has been engineered to elicit a smile holding fun at a premium.","July 17, 2015","true","3.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

They are attempting to fix  these errors just like they did on the xbox . They are doing their best to figure out what's wrong and what. So don't complain alot, just be patient !\n\nI reccomend this game to everyone, it's awesome and it is fun. When you have an everyday crew you play with and get to know the people. They all turn out awesome and it's just exciting !\n\nThe game is fun and filled with strategies you need to obtain yourself, so test out and play this game. It is very enjoyable. :)","June 7, 2014","true","173.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eclipse_mt/recommended/246280/","eclipse_mt","EclipseMT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eclipse_mt/","10 products in account","This game is fairly decent, especially on the Steam release.\n\nIn my opinion, at least, this version I see better. It may be downgraded, sure, but in reality, after playing this version for a while, I really don't see shelling out $60/yr just to play this game. Sure, there are other great titles on the Xbox, but most also have an emphasis on multiplayer. Since becoming a regular on the PC gaming community, I have seen the $60 for XBLG as not worth an investment.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it is relatively unchanged. Despite coming from a downgraded version of the Xbox release, the same formula carries on from the Xbox version, but with it, the same flaws. One major flaw is the lack of alternative gamemodes. The developers would at least have done their best to incorporate a basic free-for-all/team deathmatch gamemode (which everybody knows everybody likes).\n\nAnother major flaw is that some of the elements in this game indeed work on paper, but in practical terms, there are elements that stand out from the rest.  These elements can bias gameplay toward certain play styles, but again, on matches with the ideal amount of participants, things like this make little to no difference.\n\nDiving in to game-specific details, the primary objective is to siege the enemy's fort before the enemy does the like to you. You have two general options in this case: a full-scale rush, or a stealth trial. Stealth, however, is a bit of a mess. Even if you happen to get lucky from the skilled players not knowing you are behind enemy lines (or even the rest of the conditions are in your favor), the AI are self-conscious and can easily tell you are in their grounds. Despite this, the AI are relatively weak and are pretty easy to kill. But especially with lack of communication (even in this version) and an inability to fully hide yourself, it makes stealth almost a non-option. There are times where players have succeeded in such a risk, but again, these kinds of stuff are more luck-based than skill-based.\n\nOverall, besides the many execution failures in this game, this game is nevertheless a good experience. For those who have the Xbox version, it is indeed a worthwhile move to get this version and try it out. But accounting for the minor and little number of major flaws this game has, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this game to respect those who would rant from me, but at the same time, I woudn't say this is something to stay away from. However, because Steam requires it, my final score is the only deciding factor in my recommendation.\n\nLike I said, many features in the Xbox version are not present in this version, though I doubt any sort of dramatic addition on the Xbox will make it worth it for me to shell out another year of XBLG.\n\nHappy Wars PC gets a 7.1 out of 10, and being above 7 gets my recommendation.","November 5, 2014","true","434.5"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","1"

This game is fun and the "Pay to win" aspect isnt even that big of a deal.\n\nThe game plays like this. You go in game and u have so much money, and with that money u can play a wheel game. Theres so many areas that u can win something, or win nothing. If you pay 900 In game currency u can fill the entire board, so u cant lose and get nothing. 300 for 25%, 600 for 50%, and 900 for 100% of the wheel. You can play one game, even a loss will get you around 2000 coins. So u can use the wheel a good ammount of times.\n\nThat being said, u can get items with Stars on them, and those items are really really good, and do a lot more for you. The "Premium items" as there called. U can just simply buy these with money, yes. But u can also win them in game in that wheel i explained above. So yes, there is a "pay2win" aspect that no one enjoys on a F2P game. But, there is a way to get the EXACT same gear with in game currency, and its not that hard. I played 3 matches, and i have 2 Star items on a warrior, and 1 on a claric. Yes, its more based on chance, and yes some times it can be hard. But its still possible.\n\nNow about the game, I didnt play this on xbox or anything, so I dont have past feelings for it from some other platform as some of the reviews have mentioned. And I quite enjoy this game. Yes, at first I didnt know what I was doing, and I ran around dieing, and I still do some times. But After just 3 games I feel comfertable enough to know what im doing cause its very stright forward. So game play I would rate a 8/10 cause its simple, entertaining, relaxing, and enjoyable. But due to it being repetitive due to small ammount of maps, but thats do-able, games like league with one map are plays hundred of times, so i think people dont care about that as much as long as its fun. And it is to me.\n\nTheres a whole side thing of enchanting and upgradeing and leveling up your gear, and to me thats a Huge plus in something like this due to being able to mix up ur play style a good ammount with different gear. Thats what people want. (or at least what I want) But, unfortuntly that can be very time consuming and leveling gear takes (for me at least) a long time. So there is a little bit of a grind there. But I feel like this is both a negitive for you, and a positive for you, due to people getting an item and being able to play with it longer then you, they dont get it to level 10 and 1 shot you. So, take it for what it is. You can customize your characters a little bit, with hair, skin color, eyes, and what have you a little bit. So there is some of it, but its limited. But then again, ur not really standing around to look at peoples eyes. Lots of different cool, and silly, looking gear. The skills you get in the game from leveling in the battle is fully random (aside from the basics i believe (ex. Claric heal)) So this adds a little fun cause its not all the same thing every game, but it didnt seem like there was a whole lot of different ones, but at least it was something.\nCustomization and leveling, 8/10.\n\nYou can have up to 3 different "loadouts" to each class (only 3, warrior claric and mage) But thats better then nothing for what it is. So if u want a full DPS claric, with the option if thats not doing well with there team, you can switch to full tank support claric. and so on.\n\nWith that being said adressing the whole "op enimies when starting out" Yes this is true, yes this can be slightly annoying, but all in all, when its 15v15 and u can "xpeke" (back door) and still win with some strategy, its not all that big of a deal. The first game I played we were down 4 towers to 1, and they were starting to push the last one down, one person (just one) started to go xpeke, took the closest tower to their base, a few other people joined, and they seiged the base and before people realised this, we got through the gate and was wailing on the tower, and after about a minute more of this, we won.\n\nSo yes, it can be a problem, but its not like they can just steam roll you if your smart. Theres a lot of "team skills" that more people useing it more damage and what not it will do, like a meteor storm or a tornado that will whipe out the team if there clumped up. So if there all at the gate, one of those can help u push back, or strategic walls placed, and turrets to defend. Theres a lot of ways around it. And its not hard to get "op" gear as well (see above)\n\nAll in all, I would recomend this game, cause it does the job for me of intertaining me. It can be challanging, and with team work you can go a long ways, but its also fun to relax and just play around if ur not looking for a fully ingaged stressfull game like other games can be.\n\nTL;DR - Game play fun, decent customization, Pay2Win Aspect is there, but same itmes can be bought in game with some RNG, Skills are random each game meaning a little mix up every game. Relaxing if you wish it to be, no in game chat (only set voice commands) so no children talking smack. Can really turn the game around with strategy. Overall i would give this an 8/10.","July 24, 2014","true","4.4"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","19","37","0","0"

Even with the speed buff, you're barely moving normal speed. But it only does this at select times so you KNOW it's not just the character. I know of several others with this issue as well. What ever the computer developers did to change it to an EASIER format, they ♥♥♥♥ed it up.

The push pull mechanic of other similar action combat mobas is completely removed from this game and replaced with a 5 minute map sweep with no strategy or thought towards allowing teams to make a comeback of any sort. The games are decided within the first minute  and after that it is essentially a game of attrition (Your teams patience vs. the others onslaught). Most games I played were matched up completely unbalanced, with many 10+ level people on the same team versus 2s and 3s on the other. This adds to the shear frustration of the experience, and makes me wonder what kind of algorithm could possibly think the teams are "even".\n\nOn top of this, the game suffers (as many online games do) from a cascading effect of disconnections, as people realize their team is going to lose and simply quit out of frustration, so any hope of trying to salvage a victory is soon faded.\n\nIt's just not a fun or engaging experience once you realize your team is outnumbered and outmatched by people that have actually spent money to get the epic items required to play competitively at all.","July 4, 2014","false","4.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Plagued by horrible match-making that has seen some improvement. You can find yourself sitting there for up to 10 minutes at times(at its worst), though most can range from 1 minute to 5 minutes.  Seems to be some connection issues as well (possibly due to being matched with players from all over the world), and occasional disconnections.  Gaming population seems small, as you'll often be matched with some of the same players over and over.  Fairly interesting equipment customization.  Items can have "buffs", such as bonuses to HP, AP, allowing you to start out with certain abilities while equipped, etc.  Some of these buffs can be moved around to different items with available slots to allow for a better rounded character in battle.  Items gain level with use, as well as being able to sacrifice useless or obsolete items and "Happy Stars (currency)", or "Happy Tickets (use real money to buy these)", to increase item levels further, making them even more powerful.  Not exactly a "Pay to Win" game, even though you CAN use real money to buy tickets, and use that to buy items.  However, they only grant a slight advantage (while some are just cosmetic or set items, but remaining the same stat-wise as something similar).  Players can also win "premium items," that you normally would only be able to acquire using tickets, while playing the Spinning Wheel game, which only requires 300 Happy Stars minimum to play.  Great way to get some good gear, too.\n\nAll-in-all, I definitely LOVE this game and I'm hooked.  I wish there were more people playing this, as the 15v15 matches are a beautiful chaotic mess full of non-stop action.  Think DOTA 2 with, at times, larger maps and a lot more people, but more Anime-like (Chibe) art and cuteness rolled into a MOBA themed rampage for towers and castles, and without the incredibly toxic player-base of ranging nerds who take the game WAY too seriously.  I would absolutely recommend this game to everyone.\n\n7/10","February 22","true","33.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Just a few issues that need to be hashed out which obviously will be since only in early access. Matchmaking has a lot of problems. Disconnecting before game starts, disconnecting in middle of game. I have friends who can't even launch the game without getting weird errors. Then there is online balance issues. Dashing is completely broken and needs to either be removed or has to cost a ton of AP. And personally, I think the Rush ability should NOT knock you back if you have your shield up. Also I think the lightning slow is a little too powerful against warriors. Other than those issues, I am really into this game and I used to play it a ton on Xbox and now I don't have to pay for a subscription to play it all the time.","June 1, 2014","true","19.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is awesome, due the costumization of your characters, weapons and armors. It's like the best fun you can have, if you play whit friends. The Al's are pretty good for training too. So you may like to play whit them sometimes. The graphics are nice because of the cartoonish-style they have. You can spin some wheel to get items if you get enought money too. You have awesome skills to use and you can choose between 3 classes: Warrior, an melee fighter, Mage, An ranged magician that is based on skills, and the Cleric, which is more of an support class.

Just a few issues that need to be hashed out which obviously will be since only in early access. Matchmaking has a lot of problems. Disconnecting before game starts, disconnecting in middle of game. I have friends who can't even launch the game without getting weird errors. Then there is online balance issues. Dashing is completely broken and needs to either be removed or has to cost a ton of AP. And personally, I think the Rush ability should NOT knock you back if you have your shield up. Also I think the lightning slow is a little too powerful against warriors. Other than those issues, I am really into this game and I used to play it a ton on Xbox and now I don't have to pay for a subscription to play it all the time.","June 1, 2014","true","19.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is awesome, due the costumization of your characters, weapons and armors. It's like the best fun you can have, if you play whit friends. The Al's are pretty good for training too. So you may like to play whit them sometimes. The graphics are nice because of the cartoonish-style they have. You can spin some wheel to get items if you get enought money too. You have awesome skills to use and you can choose between 3 classes: Warrior, an melee fighter, Mage, An ranged magician that is based on skills, and the Cleric, which is more of an support class. Hope this review is not so long. I would rate this game 9/10. Hope this helped!","June 7, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There were a lot of complaints about the character being slow while "running" (slowly crawling, more like it) - which I'm totally suffering from at the moment on multiplayer mode. Fellow gamers, if you want to try it out: install it, tweak the settings a bit till it works the best it could and try your luck - it might work well for you. OR you can just wait till its full version is released. Advice to the developers, PLEASE fix the slow characters and improve connections. Matchmaking is currently working better than before, but it still needs to be a bit faster though. However, this game has a lot of potential - the character sounds and gameplay may make it very fun and quite addictive.

Now it's on PC, the best and biggest gaming platform, I can play it as much as I like without the need for a subscription, I think...\n\nThe game has premium features as many free games do, I believe you get premium weapons and stuff. Maybe it's pay to win maybe it's not, I don't know. Aside that the gameplay is fun and the customisation is pretty good too, especially with the spinner and all which is fun to use.\n\nThe game is buggy but it is an early access game so I don't blame it. I can see myself playing a lot of this as it is a great game and I recommend to everyone.\n\nA good favorite brought over from consoles, and at 800mb definitely worth a download.\n\n6/10","May 28, 2014","true","6.6"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

However once you gain time to get up in ranking it royally sucks at match making.  Always matching you with players that over power you and continuing to keep teams unbalanced.  If there are continuing to match you against players and never mixing up the teams this game is not worth playing.  I'm glad its free as I wouldn't pay for it.  I'm sorry for the XBox players.  It's more plesant playing the Co-op section, but that still has balancing issues.  There are also timing issues when hitting opponents possibly due to server lag as the game has kicked me during a winning session.  All in all the game is playable, but needs quite a bit of work.  It still is fun, but very frustrating.  Currently I do not recommend this game.  This currently seems to be a Pay to Win game unfortunately.

Honestly one of the funnest games even though it's not updated EVER. After a point of point very little of hours in ~40hours the game becomes ♥♥♥♥. Matchmaking will take long as ♥♥♥♥. Sometimes you have to wait 30 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to find a match and even then it might disconnect. On top of that flaw the game is pay to win. I put more than 50$ into this game and havn't gotten jack ♥♥♥♥. When I play versus the levels (if the matchmaking can even do that) I won't be able to even ♥♥♥♥ing scratch bot, yet alone the players. As mentioned before the game is never updated. ♥♥♥♥ Toylogic.\n\nIf you do have about 500+$ to spend on this game go ahead, the game will be fun as ♥♥♥♥.

So out of curiousity i went and tried it out. At my biggest disappointment, the PC version is absolute wank compared to the Xbox version. Pc does not have the Item Shop, you gotta pay real cash to obtain customizable items. Xbox doesn't, it's in there and with the game giving a few Happy Tickets, you can purchase it. The PC versions also isn't on the second Season, which is EXTREMELY upsetting for me. Oh yeah, there is nobody to play with PC. It took me around 13 minutes, yes i have timed it, to play a Quick Match. Xbox versions is much superior on multiple aspects, but unfortunately it requires Xbox Live Gold membership to play it, but worth it.","January 12, 2015","false","13.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, it's cute, but its also really really dumb. There's no store to buy armor or weapons, which I wish it had so I could get something other than a weak flower to use, and it makes no sense to me that it makes you level up in multiplayer just to be able to play single player levels.\n\nNot only that, but when I tried to play it again today, it kept kicking me from servers saying there was a connection issue, when I know there's not. I played it last night just fine, and wanted to give it another chance, but I can't even do that because it's a stupid piece of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSo no, I don't recommend this game to anyone who actually enjoys games.","February 28","false","1.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I would recommend this game to anyone. I have the 360 version and this still has the best moments from the console version.

Some things are missing from the 360 version also, like the daily treasure hunt & more character & weapon options.  In fairness here it's still in Early Access as of this writing so I've no doubt that will all be put in at some ppoint.  The main issue with this game currently I would say are the servers.","June 3, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have a suggestion: More blood and gore. I saw the rating and I was like: YEAH! GORE AND FREEEEEE! I was disappointed. Needs decapitation and gutting as a final move/ critical. Also needs more freedom of character customization, and needs a less confusing storyline. It's challenging and addictive.

With the ice, electric, and wind enchants you can keep your enemy from being able to attack or use moves completely, which is insanely unfair. They need to be nerfed in power, preferably by making it so its just a low chance to stun, and not every ♥♥♥♥ing hit.\n\nAnother thing about the ice enchant, the ice enchant's cast is overpowered as hell. You can easily run and shoot people with it while they're chasing you and they will never get a single hit, and sometimes it affects people that are blocking. You can also jsut spam it and they wont be able to move at all because it freezes them.\n\nSecond, the move rush needs to be weakened. You can keep sending people into the air and hit them until they are dead with it, and theres nothing they can do about it. They either need to decrease the power drastically, or implement some sort of invincibility frames system so that you cant be hurt by every hit.\n\nThe invincibility frames system should be added because it's extremely easy to gang up on someone and annihilate them without them being able to attack at all. While obviously theres strength in numbers, its such a domination that it seems unfair.\n\nAll in all its a great game but these issues need to be resolved.","June 4, 2015","true","29.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The reason why is because this. This is one of the quotes from the error popup. "Could not establish trust relationship with the SSL/TSL secure channel." . This error means that you can't play the game due to not trusting your data in your computer that is mostly its running/process list that can sometimes even make your computer run like ♥♥♥♥ if you quit its process.\n-----------------------------------------              Maybe*sniff*maybe...         ------------------------------------------------------- After Error 200/9 spread wild,the internet has posted thread after thread about error 200/9. Most of them thought they were talking about error 200/0 which is completely easy to fix. Although,when i was serching the internet,a person with this Error 200/9 happen,He responded like this. Once again,this is a quote from his response. "That steam could never fix" . Is he really true? Is steam laying off the job and not fixing anything? Or is it a Myth/Theory? Who knows! Maybe its just taking valve a hard and putrid time to fix all the errors to this awesome,fun and funny game of happy wars.\n------------------------------------------                  ANYWAYS.                    ------------------------------------------------------ This game is absolutly great game. Ha ha,you thought i just hated it,did ya? Anyways,this game's maps,A.I names etc remind me when i just had fun,having lego wars as a kid and laughing my ♥♥♥ off. Instead,get the game on the XBOX or its brothers, 360 and 1,due to the Error 200/9's destruction to the PC version. Most XBOXs,and other types of it's generation,can run the game without a problem. It's also on the XBOX marketplace and in gamestop for rated T prices i belive $29.99 is when its new and $10.00 when its pre-ordered. Maybe even $9.99 for the new w/ a gamestop premium membership or credit card.\n\nEND.\nThink valve will fix this? Click the helpful/like button.\nThink valve will be a ♥♥♥♥ and don't?

Its never been found how to be fixed or just impossible to fix.\n\n----------------------------------------THE DESTRUCTION OF ERROR 200/9------------------------------------------------------- Error 200/9 has happend to 90% of people who have installed the game. The reason why is because this. This is one of the quotes from the error popup. "Could not establish trust relationship with the SSL/TSL secure channel." . This error means that you can't play the game due to not trusting your data in your computer that is mostly its running/process list that can sometimes even make your computer run like ♥♥♥♥ if you quit its process.\n-----------------------------------------              Maybe*sniff*maybe...         ------------------------------------------------------- After Error 200/9 spread wild,the internet has posted thread after thread about error 200/9. Most of them thought they were talking about error 200/0 which is completely easy to fix. Although,when i was serching the internet,a person with this Error 200/9 happen,He responded like this. Once again,this is a quote from his response. "That steam could never fix" . Is he really true? Is steam laying off the job and not fixing anything? Or is it a Myth/Theory? Who knows! Maybe its just taking valve a hard and putrid time to fix all the errors to this awesome,fun and funny game of happy wars.\n------------------------------------------                  ANYWAYS.                    ------------------------------------------------------ This game is absolutly great game. Ha ha,you thought i just hated it,did ya? Anyways,this game's maps,A.I names etc remind me when i just had fun,having lego wars as a kid and laughing my ♥♥♥ off. Instead,get the game on the XBOX or its brothers, 360 and 1,due to the Error 200/9's destruction to the PC version. Most XBOXs,and other types of it's generation,can run the game without a problem. It's also on the XBOX marketplace and in gamestop for rated T prices i belive $29.99 is when its new and $10.00 when its pre-ordered. Maybe even $9.99 for the new w/ a gamestop premium membership or credit card.\n\nEND.\nThink valve will fix this? Click the helpful/like button.\nThink valve will be a ♥♥♥♥ and don't?

Whether you prefer swords and shields, staffs and magic, or supporting your team, Happy Wars brings that to the table and breaks the table in half.\n\nUnless you plan on spending $20-$40 on this game to get a good start, you will have to put a lot of time into this game to acquire powerful items.","June 2, 2014","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Along the way you'll need to capture towers that act as respawn points. The game is surprisingly varied despite only having 3 classes, upon performing any objective such as healing/buffing an ally, killing an enemy or helping with the construction of turrets you get exp the game has a random mechanic where each game the skills obtained are random which means there wont be any 1 consistent op class mowing through everything.\n\nDespite being a team game the game also does an excellent job of avoiding the problems other multiplayer games have that being of ragers afkers and essentially your teammates messing you over. Its impossible to rage as there isn't actually a chat system in the game outside of predetermined dialogue. Each player is scored and rewarded based off their individual performance and the game is quite geneous with its item drops.\n\nSomething similar to an auction house would be nice in the near future to allow players to either buy these premium items or  the cash currency with normal game currency. At the moment I'd recommend you try it out even if it is awfully buggy the game is quite fun and if your lucky and don't run into a game breaking bug you'll have a good time.\n\nUpdate: after playing much more i've come to the conclusion that the game is p2w. The premium items simply far outclass anything else. The weight mechanic to balance it out is ultimately pointless when after a certain point normal items simply don't weigh enough to hit the cap making it wasted space. It is possible to get premium items from the normal roulette but the odds are extremely low, out of the probably close to a hundred spins i've done i've obtained 2 premium items and this is from using currency earned over 20 hours of play. On top of that there are "super premium items" which are impossible to get out side of paying out money.\n\nI would still recommend the game because it is fun and f2p but unless there's new features that allow f2p to obtain those powerful items it's unlikely the game will have any long time merit","June 15, 2014","true","51.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you level up enough during a match, you can also cast a "team ultimate" that requires multiple players to cast and does some insane stuff (summon tornadoes, mass enchant weapons, charge the enemy as a stampede, etc.) Super addicting!","April 30, 2015","true","18.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This review may change IF they can get this game up and running for new players to join.  Until then, avoid using the HDD space if you're a new player.

But you can however buy smiles and such for you character! So i guess that sorta counts.\n\nI do love the game and i do recommend it but i will say some things, and some warnings.\n\nThe game is great, its fun, cute and can be addictive.\nHowever for new players it will be hard, good news it you have others you can rely on. I personally like to be a cleric and i heal and revive people as well as buff them. Just play, get happy stars and items, and upgrade. Once you get decent gear and you level it a fair bit you will be able to hold you own, in co-op at least.\n\n\nIf you are wanting to play pvp then you may not do so good a lot of the time, it takes good gear and communication, usually good communication can beat the good gear, teamwork on this game pays off. Many people run into issues with the game itself, such as lag and errors. Ive only ever had lag when i am also using google chrome, so my own fault, but other than that i've never had issues at all.\n\nIts a really fun game, if you are not willing to put up with things as you start out then do not fault the game right away. Other people have already got good things, and the game has been worked on as well, you cannot expect to join in late and do really well.\n\nOne thing that i find on this game that makes it unbalanced is the items themselves, they bring out items which are exclusive to happy cards, which you can earn at a very slow pace doing mission mode or by doing good in PvP each month. Now these items are usually better than the ones in the base game, and also they just get better and better. If you get one of these good items then they will most likely bring out a better one. Now you can do really well without spending money, it just takes more time, but don't expect the best items in the game unless you pay money, or are just really lucky.\n\n\n[Edit] The game is now unplayable for me, I got a new graphics card and always get an error when trying to launch. This is the only game that does such a thing, and I have seen other people talking about having the same issue. I do enjoy this game and would of loved to keep playing despite how pay to win it can be, however since it's now impossible to play, as well having in game issues like bad connection issues with players and also being heavily pay to win I have changed my review to not recommend.","April 6, 2015","false","168.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not recommended for new or casual players.\n-\n* Long loading times, even during peak hours. It can take up to 5 minutes to get into a game. Excessively long loading screens with hard-coded timers on them add to this considerably.\n* In most games one or two characters have paid money to get lots of upgrades. I have seen 6v1 battles that went in their favor -- games frequently are won or lost by the presence or absence of such people on either team. Unlocking without paying money takes an insane amount of time; Decent gear will take you over 200 hours to acquire -- with about 15% of that time wasted on forced delays and waiting for matches to start.\n* The rank system is broken -- 1 person should not be able to single-handedly beat the entire opposing team. You will see this in almost every match you play.\n* The upgrade system is fundamentally broken and designed to suck money out of your wallet. If it were more balanced, I would recommend this game. But as it is now, I cannot recommend this to anyone who doesn't have $50 to throw away.\n\n\n","October 7, 2015","false","9.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

The game is very fluid and the music bouncy and light, the leveling system works well and the campaign progression enticing enough for you to actually try to work through.\n\nHowever, multiplayer is absolutely pathetic. There are very few players in this game and the quick matches require a certain number of players to start, which is absurdly rare to do. Often, you'll accidentally run into the same people in different lobbies to the point where you'll add them to your friends list just so you can near-guarantee you'll get at least one closer to that benchmark you have to reach. When you do reach that limit, it takes a couple minutes to load up a game and getting in takes even more time, and if you're able to get a full match done without losing anyone (which would thereby forfeit the match for everyone, for god knows what reason) then you realize it's far easier and quicker to just suffer through single player AI skirmishes and work your character up that way, which actually works rather well.\n\nIf you're just looking for a good, solid free-to-play game with a SMITE feel to it but with more comical relief, this is your choice. I've been playing this game for maybe a couple years now and I still enjoy it, so I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who just wants to pass some time when they're bored.\n\n8/10","November 7, 2014","true","27.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The combat is simple and easy to get around, The camera is fast, and give you enough view of whatever is happening each class coming with it's own strength and weakness as well as unique team co op skill which one person start the cast and other people have to join in on the chant to give other people either a buff or a high powered magic cast. You can also construct turret guns that you or the enemy can take hold and shoot at your enemies from afar. I will have to say this game really owns up on it's name.\n\nMusic is fair for the game. it's fitting.\n\nit's cartoony nature with great color and vibrant theme. it's happy and never serious. The only downside finding the graphical setting is a hassle and theres really little to none for it.\n\nyour character can by customised from armor to little accessory and each item has it's own unique effect. but heres what make the game equipments strong, literaly. You can sacrifice an item to tranfer ability to another item if that item has a open slot for another passive. you can also get rid of current passive to make room for better ones. you can also sacrifice items to level your items effectiveness in damage or defence if its armor. every level gets harder and harder to level these because later you do need to sacrifice high level equipment just to boost to exp to the item fairly. The game is heavy on cutomising your own equipment in a simplistic way. It's good.\n\nTHe game is free but there is some micro transaction stuff but the game has enough stuff you can do with ingame currency that you dont have to worry about that stuff. but if you want to support the game, Go ahead.\n\ni haven't played a game like this in a while or ever really. it's allot even when the times where i get my ♥♥♥ handed, it's still puts a smile on my face. the only thing i would ahve liked is if theres a chat box.  something to be more detailed in comunicating on stratagy and stuff. or something optional in that. but other then that it's a solid game.\n\nThis game gets HAPPY 4 METEORITE BOMBARDMENT Out of 5\n\n()()()()-","May 30, 2014","true","11.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Happy Wars are more for players who want to kill players yet having a simplified gameplay. It offers up to a battle between 15-on-15 players, which can get pretty chaotic.\n\nThis game only offers three types of classes, the melee-focused Warrior, the healing and support Cleric, and the ranged damage Mage. Each class can learn up to 9 spells, each categories into three segments, the Team Skill, the Offensive, and Defensive. However the skills are randomised everytime you enter a war, allowing you to learn skills as you level up. The maximum level is 5 per war. The level is interchangeable between classes, therefore you no need to re-level whenever you swap to another class.\n\nClimbing up the ladder is fairly easy, but tough once you reach above Level 30. This Level does not coincide with the in-war leveling, but rather your overall ranking in the server. The matchmaking system are pretty good, with both sides balanced out. If the matching takes too long, it will add AI to balance out the remaining slots. AI are pretty dumb as it takes out any players when near, though they can be beneficial at times where you get a sure heal/resurrect.\n\nGetting items are guaranteed as long you level up to level 5 in each war. When in luck, you can get 3 items from the Red Present at the end of the game. Not all items are good. Some will have negative effects on the items, where you need to get it debuffed to remove the effects from the item. While winning the war, you get to earn Happy Stars to spin on the Happy Spinner. Where you gamble your tokens for equipments in a spin, a matter of luck. There's rarely players using P2W for this, even though there's Happy Cards where you get a premium item using cash. Nevertheless Happy Cards are still attainable for F2P players while earning tickets to get the Happy Cards when completing the missions.","June 13, 2014","true",""," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

And the game is good for what it is; you can get "good" gear quite easily without paying anything, but there's one major roadblock for me...\nIn the mission line (linear, blind progression), there are missions that require you to play PvP. That's not what I, literally, signed up for. These missions are required to unlock the Advanced Classes, which, by the way, took many hours of searching online to find out WHY they weren't visible for me. Apparently, if you're on the X-bawkz, you can see, "Berserker." If you're on Steam, the arrows on class selection for a loadout are black.\nSo... since it's a matchmaking game, not a lobby game, you have to get crushed in PvP before you can put a sword in your other hand. If you're really into PvP, you'll have no problem. If you're sick of mindless, generic, "PvP makes a game fun! Make it mandatory!" like me, you'll probably be disappointed.","June 17, 2014","true","9.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game is really fun to new comers and I've seen first hand how this game can ruin lives. You HAVE to pay to win. Buying happy tickets is the only way to truly get the buffs and weapons you need to dominate others. That is the only major flaw in this game. To get buffs and super premiums, you have to pay. Other than that, this game is fun . It's a team based strategy game and is better played with friends in a skype call. The only objective during the game is to take down the enemys tower within their castle. Doing so wins the game, but along the map their are towers that any team can build. Once built, these towers act as spawn points which can be taken down and re-built by the other team to act as spawn points for them.

While playing it I felt like I was playing in Single Player so it wasn't that much fun, maybe for more casual players this game would be appealing, but if you want a hardcore RPG this isn't it - too few people. This is a more casual game(in my opinion). Not a lot of people online either. Which means slow matchmaking(from 5 to 15 minutes). But the gameplay is fine, it's playable but you hardly have any control over your character(on PC, I don't know about Xbox).","October 2, 2014","false","3.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

For this type of game to be truly enjoyable you'd need to have head tracking, motion sensors to account for battle actions and character movement.  Those technologies have all been around since the 1990s.  I know, I used to play on them.  With today's computers the gamer can finally bring all those options together in a pleasurable playing experience.","July 26, 2014","false","0.5"," 0 of 27 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","27","0","0"
