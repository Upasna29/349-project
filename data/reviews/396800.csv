No longer are we cutting down trees with abandon.  Instead we must recultivate the land, grow more trees, and unleash the power of...fire hydrants?!  Yes, fire hydrants.  Who knew they had hydrants back in ancient Greece?\n\nMostly everything is the same as the other installments of this series.  The worker guys run around gathering food, wood, and gold.  They clear the pathways.  Herc hefts the huge boulders, and Megara causes plants to grow.\n\nFor those new to the series, this game does a much better job of explaining things.  There are pop up instructions of what to do.  Basically it is time management and resource management.  Each level has certain tasks to perform in order to complete the level.  If you do it fast enough you get achivements.\n\nThere are 3 difficulty levels.  Untimed, easy timed, and hard timed.  (those are NOT what they are called, but that's what they are in essense.)\n\nI'll write more later as I complete the game.

If you are a newcomer, I advise to start the series from the beginning.\n\nFor the returning audience, they’ll find probably the best game in the series, combining the level variety/design of Cretan Bull and the expanded gameplay mechanics of Girl Power. The bulk of the work is still done by servants, but by assigning a much more prominent, active role for both Megara and Hercules, there was enough change in the gameplay balance to make it feel fresh and challenging again.\nSpeaking of balance, a lot of small things were tweaked: for example thieves (and a new enemy, anti-Hercules) are less annoying or farms are more manageable. These seem insignificant on their own, but added up they make the game a lot more fun.\n\nAs a final bonus, there is now even some semblance of a story: Megara and Hercules start on a journey to regrow the Hellenic forests before they go on a well-earned vacation, struggling against the meddling gods all the time. It’s a bit silly sometimes, but it shows that the developers really cared.","February 15","true","11.9"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

Previous installment: 12 Labours of Hercules, Cretan Bull, Girl Power.\n\nNotes\nThere is a storyline for the game but it isn't much to it nor its' rememberable. The gamplay formula is pretty much the same as its' predecessors.\n\nUnlike its' predecessors. This is the first game from the series to have a platinum edition.\n\nGameplay\nThis is a time management game, where careful planning is required, limited amount of resources that are available throughout the game; hence the word management.\n\nThis game has the total of five episodes with eleven levels each; totaling out fifty-five levels altogether. The five bonus levels can be unlocked when the jigsaw puzzle is completed. The fifth episode is a bonus episode.\n\nThere are three modes, relaxed; casual and expert, the difference between them is the timer speed and scoring. In relaxed mode, no timer and no scoring. In casual mode, the timer drain a slowly and the scoring is moderately low. In expert mode, the timer drain much quicker and the scoring is much higher.\n\nThe stars that are earned from completing the level depends upon on how much time is left on the timer. This only applies to the causal and expert modes\n\nThree Gold star is when the time has not gone pass the arrow. Two Silver star is when the time has gone pass the arrow. One Bronze star is when the timer is empty.\n\nReplaying any of the levels will improve the game score and the amount star.\n\nThe Palace is build after each levels that has been completed in gold record time.\n\nThere are few special bonuses: Freeze Time, Worker Movement/Work Speed, Additional Worker and Increases Resources. All of these special bonuses has a certain time limit but they can be used again once the bar fills-up. These special bonuses are very useful when the game is being played on expert mode.\n\nThere are twenty-two different achievements to earned from playing the game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements in order to unlock them.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere are nine different wallpapers. They can be accessed through the game's main menu screen.\n\nThere are seven different trading cards to collect. Only three cards are dropped from the game. The remaining cards:  Purchase from the Steam Market; Steam Booster Pack Creator and or Drop; Trade with friends. The cards are then used to craft the game's badge and upgrade it.\n\nI don't think that this game much of replay value to it. If you're into time management games then you might find this game somewhat enjoyable to certain extent.","May 14","true","17.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","2"

This time Hades, Zeus and Hera act together and how should it be, Hercules get a dark twin (Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time Water Temple greets). The game is like before getting resources and some extra fields are no in the game, Hercules can splash gems where foodbushes comes out, the evil hercules comes your peasants in the way and you must take him out fast to lose less time, if thiefs comes you must react fast. So not many change you have 50 levels, 5 puzzles where you need to find most of the puzzle pieces in the 50 levels before, then you get 5 extra levels and a super level at the end and you can try like before to beat the developer records as a test of your strategy and reacting testing with make your routes so effective like possible. Not much changed, but the levels feels still after 3 games before unique and i had my fun, for me its with a little step the best hercules of all 4 at the moment, but some could get bored after 3 games, because the gameplay is mostly the same, the little storie parts are a nice gimmick but nothing more. I give this game for 10 hours of fun and to see how old and slow i get (joke) but because i love all of this tacticaly genre 93 %, for non genre lovers it should be more less points, but because its cheap and you play it from start to end for such a cheap price, its okay, if you hate strategy games, you better go out this way, maybe you test on of the first 3 games before.

There really isn't any strategy needed if you play the casual or standard difficulty levels to get gold, or three stars.  But, it's somewhat addicting and fun at the same time while being mindless.  Same as the rest of the series you are in charge of telling your workers and heroes what to do so you can finish each level.  Whether it's building things, or collecting resources, your workers and hereoes will be busy at every moment of every level.  Fun game if you don't mind the mindless gameplay.  However, if you play the expert level, which is required to play in order to beat the developer time achievements, then you will find that strategy does matter.  Do you want the extra worker first?  Do you want to upgrade your lumber mill first, should you get the gold mine first......all of these things make a huge difference in your time for beating a level and therefore gives you a better chance of obtaining gold.  Fun times and looking forward to 12 Labours of Hercules V.","April 30","true","12.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

As someone who's played the previous three, I would say this is the strongest, as it incorporates all the elements from previous games, while adding some new mechanics. Here, Hercules and Megara have more of a role than in previous games, although the servants do most of the work (of course). What's interesting is how they've added other features , such as a "Midas Exchange", where you can exchange supplies or food for gold. There are new tracks to the original soundtrack as well. The gameplay is like the previous games, so if you haven't played them, I wouldn't recommend to start off with this one. Great for casual play to sneak in the day for a few minutes.","March 9","true","9.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Slightly diversified (with new game play features, bonuses and surprises) to make each game a bit different, while keeping enough in common with the previouse one(s), which shortens waste of time and nerve on mastering the next game, that's valuable. Repetative, yet it feels all right here, can't remember myself being driven into bore even once. I beat all four games 100% on expert difficulty and still wouldn't mind to see the fifth. Taken into account the fact that games like these are not my idea of fun (or they weren't at least))) - what better recommendation could i give to a game. If you are looking for a highly involving and entertaining, not all that hard yet challenging enough game - check this one. Probably you will be pleased even beyond your expectations.\n---------------\nСерия из четырех одинаково отличных и очень качественно(во всех отношениях) сделанных игр- тайм менеджеров. Слегка отличающихся друг от друга (по набору игровых аспектов, бонусов и сюрпризов), ровно настолько чтобы не быть совсем однообразными, и при этом не вынуждать учиться играть заново, что несколько сокращает затраты времени и нервов на освоение каждой следующей игры, что порадовало. В принципе они достаточно однообразны, но здесь это не кажется недостатком, не помню ни разу чтобы это как то обломало интерес к игре.  Полностью прошел все четыре на экспертной сложности и не отказался бы от пятой. С учетом того, что сами игры далеко не из списка моих предпочтений (по крайней мере не были))), вряд ли я придумаю способ высказаться об игре в еще более позитивном духе.\nВ общем, если вы подыскиваете что-нибудь достаточно увлекательно-развлекательное, при этом не слишком сложное, но тем не менее бросающее определенный вызов вашим способностям в пределах разумных затрат времени и сил - то это как раз то что надо. Вполне возможно порадует даже сверх ожиданий.","February 22","true","36.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Other things are still the same. The soundtrack just got extended by one cowboy piece. The graphics are like in part three and the gameplay is busy as in part two. The goals are quite hard to reach.

Let's start over. His name is Hercules. For one year, he was bedridden, sick, his wife Megara at his bedside. That's what happens you ♥♥♥♥ some (not so) powerful gods off. In the meantime, for some reason, his land became barren and desert. So now he has to restore it, bring the animals and water back, while fighting a wicked version of himself summoned by the same (not so) powerful gods.\n\nThis fourth 12 Labours of Hercules brings every previous good ideas and mechanisms back ; still the same kind of game but with new stuff this time, unlike the previous opus. You'll discover some interesting things like a new portal system, hidden objects, more complex levels. There are even some new musics, including one very entertaining reminding me of Django (Tarantino).\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best game of the series. But if you have never played it, I suggest to start with the first game anyway. If you're looking for another kind of games, casual, relaxing yet entertaining, or if you liked the 12 Labours of Hercules' games so far, I will greatly recommend you to give it a try.","March 12","true","9.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","0"

However this is by FAR is the best champagne corker and need of a toast that the developers can come up with new ideas if i have ever seen one. In fact if they finish the series off on this one I would understand as it would be difficult for them to top as they have really set the bar high for themselves now.\n\nThe biggest difference to me is that your time management actions and mangament of resources actually changes the backgrounds of each level as you create rivers and forests and beautify the surroundings. On the downside this doesn't last long as you will have to do it again each time you replay the level. Like in Hercules 3 though you do get to decorate a palace which stays that way for good.\n\nThere are many new characters, obtscales and decors that have not been in any of the previous versions. Some which at first created a 'what the hell' moment as I scratched my head how to defeat this new enemy. Also worthy to mention is that the level layout itself seems to be improved and some of them made me stop and think what i actually needed to do to get over there. I also like how they have changed the expert level so that it represents one big star and boy are they challenging. No longer is it about just the quickest way through the level but also what else can i click on in the level to raise my score up. Try and beat the developers record on 1.1 and you will soon see what i mean.\n\nThe fact that Hercules eventually travels to an alien God Like land and traverses the portals and landscape to subdue his enemy was also well done. The story seemed some what more interesting than previous versions and was slightly disappointed that we did not get to see more of him and 'yoshi' eating megara's fruit afterwards.\n\nI would be seriously surprised if Jetdog trumps this version any more without ruining it, but just in case they are up for the challenge here are a couple of things that i would like to see them maybe implement...\n\n1) More unusual achievements for us to try and get than the old ones you constantly rehash.\n2) Instead of a palace which gets better and better, how about a garden like the 'hanging gardens of babylon'.\n3) While your 12 desktops are welcoming thought they could have been better placed as an unlockable reward for those who go the extra mile to unlock all the achievements.\n4) It would be nice if there was a super reward for those who are truly daring to beat the developers records on all the levels.\n5) Maybe some other unlockable cards, music, facts or even a developers photo gallery at the end.\n\nIn final i guess this made the biggest impact on me only because i played the previous three and they didn't reach further than a mediocre experience. This one really showed that Jetdogs has the ability to think both out of the square, puch the boundaries and deliver.

Well, Nature seems to die around, Hercules is sick but recovers quickly before being confronted to his evil twin and after bashing Zeus, Hades and Hera (who were his previous opponents in the previous games), he has to rebuild a resort.\n\nAnd why does Mother Nature do? Well..., during the five episodes, if you save the nature, you'll uncover some new paths... Well, your servants are still doing the gathering of food (whether from a farm or from bushes or from cheese on the map), gold (whether from mining or the gold on the map) and wood (whether from the trees or from the workshop or from the wood on the map). You still have to repair bridges, holes in the ground, cover lava or acid pit, remove (golden) teeth or horns, etc... You can still upgrade your workshops, farms and mines to have a better recolt, you can still build obelisks to the glory of Demeter, Hermes, Hephaïstos or Apollo for permanent bonus, Megara is still used for growing bushes or pearls and Hercules for removing boulders, Cerberus for scaring ghosts, Pegasus for removing rocks, Medusa to scare Minotaurs, Cyclops to take sheeps, Charon to take floating ressources against gold... And you still have bonus that can be used for a limited time (stopping the timer, going faster, working faster, more ressources, one more temporary servant), during the levels. You still have thiefs, though they're not as common as before.\n\nSo what really changed? Well, now, Megara can relive dead trees or washes away oil spills. Hercules can open fire hydrants. And these actions in some levels can unlock blocked paths (because of fire, because of water, etc..). That's the major change in the game. Also, now, the evil twin can block the servants's path and only Hercules can give him a shot in the posterior. Two new characters appear also as merchants: Midas can give gold against wood or food while Epaius or something like that can exchange wood for food for example. And only Megara can negociate with them.\n\nOtherwise, it's still the same way to tell the story, the same graphics, the same music, the same puzzles to unlock bonus levels and the same achievements as before. And for the extras, as it's a special edition, it's only a guide and wallpapers.\n\nSo, yeah, I wasn't really expecting a new way of playing. The new additions are nice though. It's changing a little the repetitive stuff (send servants to collect, etc..). Also, where you had a special final level at the end of each world, here, there is none.\n\nSo, the price is correct for the game. Those who liked the previous games will enjoy this one too. Those expecting more actions or twists will be disappointed. I've enjoyed this fourth game. And I do think that it's still worthy to be recommended even if there is no big surprise.","January 23","true","12.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

If you loved the others and can stand wasting even more time then by all means go for it, personally I finally got bored of clicking.","May 7","false","4.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Not only that, it's the same exact thing you had to do in the last three games.  So, that's like 200 levels of the exact same thing.  It's all so easy with absolutely zero challenge, but for me, this is my last game of the series and when I'm done, I'll be done.  Good riddance.\n\n4/10\n\nOnly recommended if you like easy 100%s.","May 16","false","9.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This rapid pace makes you suspicious that we have a "more of the same" situation here - and yes, while there are slight changes between the episodes, we basically have four near-identical games with almost 200 levels altogether. More of the same is not a sin, of course - if the quality remains stable and the pricing is right, it can be quite attractive. Fortunately, this is the case with 12LoH.\n\nAt this point, the game shouldn't need much introduction - if you're unfamiliar with the series, start with the first one, there's a demo and everyting. As a short summary, it's a time management game with appealing audiovisuals, good level design and a decent challenge on the hardest difficulty.\n\nCompared to the first game, there are a few new elements, the most notable being Megara (Hercules' wife) playing an active part (starting from ep3, actually) - since she doesn't introduce strategic variety (ie. you're always best off doing all her tasks early), I don't find much value here. Thieves were also new in ep2 or ep3 (you can guess what they do), and in ep4, sometimes an evil version of Herules appears to scare your servants. Managing thieves does add an additional dimension to the gameplay, while evil H is just an annoyance.\nThe level design quality remains more or less constant. On most levels you need to make sure you balance your resources well, but there are some levels where you can find different solutions - these tend to be the more enjoyable.\nDifficulty is an interesting question. I do feel that the games get easier as the series progresses, but it's quite possible that I'm so used to the gameplay that I automatically make better choices than in the first game. To counter this a bit, there's a developer record for each level beyond the gold time, but to be honest, I can't believe it's really what it's called - many times, I do better than that on the first try. So in the next installment, some extra difficulty would be nice.\n\nAll in all, it's easy to recommend the 12 Labours of Hercules series - buy one, play it through, if not bored yet, buy next, repeat. If bored, stop for a couple of months, and try again. When I think of the term "quality casual game", 12LoH is definitely one of the first game that springs to mind.\n","March 5","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
