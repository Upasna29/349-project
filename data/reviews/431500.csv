Ok then.\n- Also, there isn't a character in the movie Night of the living dead named "Living dead" and the zombies in the movie don't even look like that.\n- The game is in Beta but it doesn't mention that anywhere on the store page. If this is the Beta then i'd hate to see what kind of wretched mess the Alpha build was.\n\nOh God.\nIf you're the developer and you're reading this then you have some massive balls for putting this on Steam because it is horrible and ♥♥♥♥ but at least it's free.\nStill ♥♥♥♥ though.","April 16","false","0.2"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","87","39","45","19","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyCanuck84/recommended/431500/","CrazyCanuck84","CrazyCanuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyCanuck84/","859 products in account","OverviewClash of the Monsters intrigued me when I first saw it because of its concept; classic movie monsters battling it out, so it was promptly added to my wishlist.\n\nHere we are, the game is out, and just over an hour into it, I cannot recommend it. At all.\n\nThe developer says the game is in beta, but from attempting to play it, it feels more like a very unpolished early access title. In fact, if this were released in early access, I’d be more forgiving toward it. But alas.\n\nThe game has controller support, but I don’t know why; controller usage is horrendous. Even a slight move of the stick causes the cursor to move rapidly. Tilting it to the right to select a character sends the selection flying. This occurs with both my Xbox One wireless, and Steam controllers.\n\nCharacter selection is okay, but slightly odd. I question why Ichabod Crane is a character, when he wasn’t a monster. Or why there’s a monster called “living dead”, ie: zombie. There’s no creature in horror movie history called “living dead”. Developer’s claim of it being from Night of the Living Dead is dubious, at best. As for levels, there’s only one, and it’s very generic.\n\nHovering the mouse over a character doesn’t do anything, but clicking instantly chooses that character for you. Why? Why can’t I click once to see the character, and again to confirm? Once you’ve gotten to the screen to select the level, you can’t go back; if you want to change characters, you’ll need to start the match, exit, and redo everything. Not sure why a “back” button is so difficult, but I digress.\n\nGraphically, the game is quite ugly. The models are very basic, the only available level (as of this review) is basic. Sound effects and music may as well be absent; I’d prefer silence over the bad effects in this.\n\nControls while fighting are questionable. Escape does nothing, but spacebar is the pause button. When I tried to quit a match by going to “back to menu”, it looked like a box popped up asking if I was sure, but immediately disappeared, leaving me to let the timer run out. There’s also no mouse cursor in the pause menu, so you have to use the keyboard, which wouldn’t be a bad thing if the menu actually responded to what you wanted. The only way to actually get the three options to work is to use the mouse to click them, as the keyboard controls just pop up and then disappear. But since the mouse doesn’t actually have a cursor and you have to guess where it’s hovering, this is ridiculous. And once you do click “Yes” to exiting to the main menu, you have to press space to close the pause screen before it loads the main menu. This is not the 90s, things like this should not happen.\n\nAs for multiplayer, you’re basically back in the early nineties where you need the IP address of the person in order to connect. Yeah. I had no problem doing that when I played Doom back in 1993, but it’s 2016.\n\nLastly, it’s free to play. Not necessarily a bad thing, but there are no advertisements and nothing to purchase so far, so I question where the revenue comes from. Perhaps the developer will release additional character packs over time. Hopefully those packs will come after the game has been put into a playable state.\n\nProsFree?\nHas potential to be an interesting fighterConsGraphics are horrendous\nSome odd character options\nVery limited playability\nPoor control scheme, both with keyboard and controller\nPoor UI that doesn’t respond to mouse interactions correctly unless you’re at the main menu\nMultiplayer requires direct connection to IP; info says matchmaking will come eventually, but that should be a pretty basic option for a game that advertises multiplayer\nSpecial moves are pretty basic and don’t also register, despite the same combos being usedSummaryIt may be free to play, but it’s best to avoid this until (if) it gets some major fixes. Controls are horrible, graphics are horrible, gameplay is horrible, and it’s just, overall, a pretty terrible game at the moment, and I really don’t know this is not in early access. The current state is definitely more alpha than beta.\n\nI wish the developer the best of luck, and will gladly change this review and even purchase items if the core of the game gets fixed. Until then, find your fighting need elsewhere.\n","April 14","false","1.0"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","24","29","0","0"

The fact the released it in this stage.....for free......why?  Such a cool idea.....Such Garbage.\n\nI cannot control the main menu with a xbox controller.  I feel like i did a bunch of coke and when i push down just a hair, i fly through the entire menu option 5 or 6 times.  So after spinning the wheel a few times, i finally got to Arcade Mode which allowed me to enter the fighter select screen.  At this screen i was limited to one or two fighters, as the sensitivity is through the roof, it is impossible to select the fighter you want.  So, take a drink and spin the wheel again to see which fighter you will get.\n\nUpon finally picking whoever the game wanted me to play as a fighter, I entered my first match.  The fight started, my character started jumping up and down over and over again.  i checked my controller, it was centered and nothing was pushing it.  After a minute of watching my guy doing trampolene warm ups i touched the controller.  i pushed the right button to move my character to fight and he started punching.\n\nI decided at this point to quit and reinstall the game.

This game is in "beta" however i would say its still in alpha, and it would've been better if developers kept it like that.\n\nPros:\n- no microtransactions (everything in game is unlocked straight away, and you can play it without any limitations)\n- some of characters are funny (skeleton, invisible man)\n- developers are dedicated\n- currently supports 2 players local multiplayer\n- online multiplayer and leaderboard are in development (however you still can play online, but without\n\nCons:\n- characters could use some hitbox tweaks and better animations (yes, the nosferatu's bird and such)\n- there is little variety between characters' attacks and attacks have 2d animations\n- soundtrack is out of place and too loud\n- could use better and more sounds except same one for each punch\n- combo list can be confusing (P1 means punch one a.k.a. low punch , K1 means kick one or low kick, d means down, f foward, etc..)\n- lack of content and unlockables\n- could use single player story\n- lack of players\n\n","May 18","false","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a HEAP of work to do here.\n\nFirst: I'm cool with Bones AND the Living Dead characters, but if you want them to be "characters" you'll need to characterize them first.\n\nSecond: FIX THE PAUSE BUTTON. Good LORD the game pretty much broke for me as soon as I pressed it. Best thing I can think of is for it to activate when you LET GO of the button, not PRESS it.\n\nHowever I am watching and I am following. I like the way the game looks and I love the concept, so I am rooting for you. Just try to be more forward about the flaws in this stage of the development. The special moves are inconsistant and I gotta admit, if you can, I'd love a watch mode just because watch mode's are fun.\n\nAs I say, love the idea, love the look - hope it gets better.

The game is not just another Mortal Kombat ripoff. It's worse. I could barely figure out the controls when I was forced into the tutorial that teaches you nothing! The previously mentioned controls, in their default settings, are completely ridiculous. "t,""y,""u," and "i" to punch? Why are there four different punch options?! The game gives you no instructions on how to play or on how the characters work. The roster seems like it could be interesting, but I don't get to experience these infamous horror characters beating the crap out of eachother! I want to do that. I want Nosferatu to fight a zombie. That sounds awesome! This could be like the old crossover horror movies of the 1940s and 50s, if it wasn't complete trash. Also, on a side note, the graphics are certainly on the ugly side. They are not very important, but it certainly is not very appealing. This game needs a complete overhaul. It also needs more multiplayer options. And speaking of options, this game needs the ability to customize the settings from IN the game. Do not get this game unless you want to laugh yourself to death because of how horrible it is.","May 23","false","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gnomelord/recommended/431500/","gnomelord","Gnome Lord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gnomelord/","316 products in account","-Gnome Lord's Review 4/15/2016-\nLet's be clear up front. In it's current state, this game is rough. VERY rough. So why have I given it a positive review? Because I have some faith in this could be gem, and considering it is free, I am willing to continue to give it more of my time so long as improvments progressivly debut. I'll give a short summary of the game, and my experience with it so far.\n\nClash of Monsters is a classic 2D plane fighting game featuring in horror themed characters from both popular film and literature works.  As of current, the game has 8 characters, with only 7 seemingly playable These include in no specific order, The Living Dead (Classic Zombie), Nosferatru (The O.G Vampire), The Headless Horseman (Pumpkin Lord). Ichabod Crane (Sleepy Hollow Protagonist), The Bride of Dracula (Traditional Vampire), The Invisible Man (Basically a Phantom), and Bones (A Skeleton). The 8th character is supposably "The Phantom of the Opera" but I am unable to pick him myself for whatever reason.\n\nEach character currently has two punches, two kicks, and a throw. There is currently no block button, and this is something I think is certainly needed as it is otherwise too easy to get pummeled (tho maybe I just need more practice.)  When testing around with each character, it is apparent they each have unique abilities such as The Bride of Dracula sprouting wings and leaping across the stage, or the Living Dead latching onto an opponent to munch on their torso, which is great and adds unique flavors to each character. Speaking of stages, there is currently only one, known as Sleepy Hollow, and it is pretty basic featuring a stone walkway, some fog, and twisted trees and water in the background. Nothing too exciting, yet.\n\nWhile the game has controller support, it definetly needs some work. Navigating the menu can be a struggle with the cursor flying all over the place, and fights in general are very clunky. It feels like some of my moves are delayed, and that is a big no no in fighting games. The game has a special moves list for each character, but this can only be accessed in battle and frankly was sometimes tough to open. I have not attempted to use the keyboard often because I don't find them suitable for my fighting game needs.\n\nThe graphics are maybe comparable to that of the early Ps3/Xbox360 era. They could no doubt use some work, but the inspiration is clearly there, it just needs to be put into further motion with more detail being desired by myself. The games audio is average. It needs more music as there is currently only one mind numbing song which gets repetative quick due to its distinct "epic" theme. And the sound effects in general are for the most part seemingly shared among characters with a few small exceptions.\n\nIn it's current state, I would have to give this game a 5 out of 10, maybe a 6 if I was feeling generous. The inspiration is there, but this game is far too rough in its current stage to be what I would consider a Beta. However, in an era where couch co-op is rapidly fading, and games like thisoffer more of those chances,  I am willing to put my hopes in the future of this game so long as the Dev's take note in what the public desires in order to mold and shape a quality fighting game worthy of anyone's steam library.","April 14","true","1.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Although in its momentary state, I couldn't recommend it, but I still give an upvote, because I've fallen in love with game idea, and I can't wait for other playable monsters, and other maps!\nAnd I don't have any problems with the graphics or the animation, I quiet like it to be honest, it gives the game a creepy vibe, but hey, maybe it's just my opinion.\n\nBut I have experienced a pretty weird thing. Now I'm not sure if I only didn't get something right, or are these real issues.\nWhen i select the character, I click on it with the mouse. But if I do that, player2 is also going to be the one that i chose for myself. I tried using the keyboard for choosing different character, but no matter which one i pressed, it didn't react to it, so I always had to fight against the same monster that I also chose. (although I play this with keyboard, so maybe it works fine with a controller)\n\nAnd some other reviews already wrote: pausing problems, no quit button, weird deafult buttons, and bad/weird controls (or at least with keyboard).\n\nSo in conclusion: there are many things that are needed to be fixed. BUT with a little more work, it can become an amazing game, with great and unique content!","April 14","true","0.3"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"
