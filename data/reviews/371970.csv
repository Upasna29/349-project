I would pay $20 for this game and still get the same out of it, though if you want to pick up copies for friends (trust me when I say you'll want to after you get a taste) or if you're simply a cheapskate, and the below text appeals to you, you would be making a mistake not to buy this game.\n\n\nThis is easily the best game purchase I've ever made, and I don't regret buying it for around four other people within my first few hours of playing.\n\nLike games such as Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, Dwarf Fortress, and other roguelikes, though especially NetHack (which is renowned as the grandfather of every roguelike and video game RPG that exist), this game will eat you, chew you, spit you out, set you on fire, and then stomp on you; and that's on a good day, and usually only if you're playing with friends.\nBut like games such as Quake, DOOM, and other classic first person shooters, the controls are easy enough to get used to, while not compromising complexity or challenge.\n\nRoguelikes tend to be represented by tileset based graphics like a board game, or letters/numbers/other characters to represent things in the game world. They're also turn based, and typically never multiplayer due to the turn based gameplay.\n\nBarony violates these 'rules of the roguelike' with the following:\n\n- can be played with up to 4 people (extremely important)\n- a three-dimensional voxel graphic system (3D pixel-ish, but is still very aesthetically pleasing, and actually feels nostalgic with a 90s feel unlike your average game that uses pixel art graphics for no good reason)\n- a first person perspective (as opposed to a board game look where you see everything from above)\n- real time gameplay (roguelikes are usually always turn based)\n\nThere are probably other important roguelike rules I'm missing, yet, despite these changes, this game is the purest example (besides NetHack itself) of what a roguelike is, and is largely directly inspired by NetHack (not the same story, but definitely the same spiritually). These are not criticisms. The fact that Barony can manage these changes while still feeling like a true roguelike every step of the way is what proves it to be as good as I'm making it out to be. (in fact, these changes make the game easier for people to pick up and get into, but that's just my opinion)\n\n\nIn terms of what a classic dungeon crawling roguelike should have, Barony excels in such:\n\n- death is permanent\n- extremely hard and unforgiving\n- extremely fun overall (in terms of actual fun, and Dwarf Fortress 'Losing is Fun!' fun)\n- cryptic and doesn't make anything obvious (while every bottle of swirly orange liquid will do the same thing, it won't tell you what it does unless the effect itself is obvious, like invisibility -- only if you identified it through appraisal or a scroll of identify will it tell you what it does before you drink it)\n- many levels, with randomized layouts that change every time\n- is NOT simple, even though it looks like it is (you normally wouldn't expect eating too much to be a problem, until your character vomits and suddenly you're starving to death because your stomach is empty)\n- lets you learn from your dying experiences so you know not to make the same mistakes -- this is very important, as death is a learning experience as opposed to you simply not being good enough or bad luck\n- also is likely to make your death hilarious as opposed to frustrating\n- near death experiences are also very fun (don't believe me? you will after you escape a minotaur)\n- many different ways to play\n- many secrets\n- a lot more that i'm forgetting\n\nIn addition, Barony's co-op play is not only extremely fun, but somehow turns the death of every party member except you from horribly frustrating to uncontrollable laughter at the circumstances through which your friends died. It somewhat violates the permadeath rule in that the party heading to the next level respawns who died, but this is offset by the fact that you may not be able to carry all of the equipment that your friends had to return it, and that your chance of surviving long enough to get to the next level to revive them is as low as their chance not to die first was.\n\nMy only complaint is that even though I haven't beaten it as of the time of writing this review, and probably won't for a very long time, there doesn't seem to be that much content in comparison to NetHack as far as levels go (from my understanding of the game's insides, the shortest a game can be is 20 levels), and there could be more tiers of equipment beyond wooden/bronze/iron/steel (correct me if i'm wrong).\n\nCondensed, here's what I think of the various aspects:\n\nGraphics - 8/10 (this is probably because i'm biased toward old school voxel graphics, but if Minecraft is pleasing to your eye, Barony will be something your eyes will savor)\nSound - 7/10 (could be more realistic, but the sound effects do easily match the graphics, which are old school)\nMusic - 9/10 (very fitting, and very nostalgic)\nGameplay - 10/10 (see everything I wrote above)\n\nAs far as suggestions go, if the developers or anyone influential on the game's direction can read this, I would suggest more equipment, more enemies and maybe more bosses (skeletons are cool and all, but i'd love to see more), more levels, pretty much more everything if there's no plans to already. NetHack had an absolutely overwhelming number of enemies, items such as wands, weapons, potions (which were randomly generated in every playthrough! I would recommend having a system such as that, akin to Binding of Isaac's randomly generated pill effects), etc. Of all those, my main request would be more enemies. As a nice addition, perhaps sliders or difficulty/'complication' levels would be a good idea to either new or hardcore players, as too much can easily overwhelm a person (which NetHack does with no problem) and spoil their experience -- though balanced in such a way that it still remains true to it's roguelike roots.\nAll of this said however, the developers are already doing an amazing job, and the above are simple suggestions that I think, from my experiences of playing NetHack and other roguelikes, would greatly enhance the game. This may not reflect the vision of the developers.\n\nFinal Judgement - 10/10\nIf you like everything I wrote above, are tired of more casual games being too easy, want some more challenge, love NetHack and want something similar, love NetHack and want to play it with friends, or are just looking for the next RPG to sink your time into, get this game.\n\nOr get this game anyway and see how many times you die in your first two hours. (My count: 43)\n\n(also add me on Steam if you want someone to play this with!)","November 14, 2015","true","20.5"," 84 of 91 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","84","91","9","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Illokonereum/recommended/371970/","Illokonereum","Illokonereum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Illokonereum/","201 products in account","Do I recommend this game? Emphatically.\n\nFirst there will be a general overview of the game, followed by a breakdown of its parts.\n\nBarony is a game that honestly surprised me. I didn't actually want to get it at first, but was convinced by a friend. Don't let the graphics or negative reviews by people who have played for 10 minutes turn you off. This is a genuinely satisfying game with challenging but fair gameplay and simple RPG elements, such as unique equipment, rare encounters, and stats and skills that grow as you use them. Despite its simplistic nature, the game has surprising depth and replayability. A variety of classes all with unique starting equipment and playstyles, random dungeons and loot, so many ways to live or die, and secrets to top it all off, it is well worth the $7 you pay.\n\nWhile there are some people who can't handle permadeath, the game plays in such a way that failure feels like an experience instead of a loss. If you have a good mindset and learn from your mistakes instead of blaming something else. It makes you want to play again to overcome a failure that was ultimately your own. You need to be careful to survive. Peek around every corner, and keep an eye out for traps. My best character, who'd found the legendary spear Gungnir, become an expert at magic, felled the minotaur, and was strong enough to move boulders, died to a spike trap that I was entirely aware of, I just turned too soon when passing it. If I'd been more careful, I might have beaten the game, as I was very well equipped at that point. The moral of the story is that you are never untouchable. This game doesn't cater to your power fantasies the way games like Skyrim do. You can't faceroll through it without ever dying. You are quite mortal, regardless of how lucky you get with gear. And I like that about the game. It's never *too* easy.\n\nFor some, this first part may be enough. But for people on the fence, we'll take a more in-depth look at the game and its features.\n\nSettings: The game supports resolution up to 1920x1200, and other than a few simple features like blood and visual effects such as bobbing and shaking, the game doesn't have any real graphics settings. Both me and a friend have had issues with resolution. If you change the resolution to that of your monitor without selecting fullscreen, the game will glitch out and you'll have to reinstall it entirely. Additionally, using any command that begins with "/res" (such as "restart"), will make the screen go black, and I had to remove every file related to Barony and reinstall it to undo it. The only con with having to reinstall the game is losing your highscores, but luckily I'd taken screenshots. Other than that, I've had no issues. The game has crashed once in the entire time I've played.\n\nAesthetics: The graphics are simplistic, but have a certain oldschool charm. The screenshots don't really do it justice for how nice it can look despite its simplicity, and they can't convey the excitement you feel in exploring a new area. There's not much to say about the graphics. You can either appreciate the style or not.\nLight plays a major role in the game. Torches, spells, and fires provide light to pierce the darkness of the dungeon, and some areas are especially dark, making these tools almost essential to proceed.\nThe overall ambience of the game is relatively grim, for the dungeon is dark and full of terrors, and the somber music accentuates this when not in combat. It's slow and suspenseful normally, but changes when you enter combat, and becomes frantic if you linger in any particular floor for too long, signalling the arrival of the minotaur. The music is nothing spectacular, but it fits the mood of the game well.\n\nGameplay: This is the most important part of any game, right? After watching a brief exposition drop that tells you about the town of Hamlet and its cursed mine containing the ghost of the tyrannical Baron Herx, you'll be met with a simplistic character creation screen. Male or female, check. Select one of 10 classes, each given a rating of how hard it supposedly is to play, and each with different equipment, some with spells, and each with its own unique batch of stats and skills, though at low level, no one will excel at anything, and anyone can learn any set of skills with training, so a starting class is an idea more than a formula you have to follow. After selecting your class, you can choose one of five basic appearances. It's a bit lacking, and all but one of the options comes with a beard for males, but it's acceptable. For games like this you don't want a super customized character anyway, because they'll die in a matter of minutes and be gone forever regardless. I do wish it had a white hair and purple eyes option, though. That's my favorite.\n\nEquipment plays a much larger role than classes, I find. You have a selection of basic medieval weapons; swords, spears, axes, maces, halberds, bows, slings, crossbows, and staves (including magic staves with built in spells). Along with weapons comes a variety of armor and clothing, as well as accessories. Nothing special there, really. What matters are the ones that are enchanted, and these are what can make or break your run, as they can have incredible effects like invisibility, levitation, or even the ability to reflect spells. The only catch is that items are unidentified unless appraised, which is very slow and has a low rate of success unless you've trained your appraise skill, which you should. You can use unidentified items, but much of the equipment you find is cursed. Cursed items have a wide variety of negative effects from blinding, strangling, setting you on fire, and so on. And they can't be unequipped unless with a spell or by breaking them. This adds a unique dynamic to the game, in that enchanted items are borderline required to thrive in the dungeon, but at the same time, there is a great danger in equipping them, as they can easily put an end to even the greatest of heroes. It hearkens back to the oldschool D&D days, and it is found well appreciated by me.\n\nThe combat of the game is minimalistic. There are weapons, and you click to attack, hitting anything in front of you, even if it's a party member. Along with the basic weapons, there are spells. Powerful but costly, as they can quickly eat up your mana, leaving a magic focused character helpless. Cowardly, but effective, ranged combat and magic are the best ways to deal with enemies while avoiding damage. You can block, but it's not going to save you indefinitely. Should you take damage, there are healing items and you regain health over time, but linger on any floor too long, and you'll be beset by the minotaur, a colossal beast that will tear weak players to shreds, presumably to discourage waiting to regain health before proceeding to the next floor.\n\nThe overall goal of the game is to proceed through the floors of the mine without dying, and ultimately defeat the villain, Baron Herx.  There is a bit of lore (yes, this game even has lore) that indicates that the Baron isn't the worst thing that lurks below the ruins of the town of Hamlet, however. A tome titled "The Adventurer Who Went To Hell" implies that you can do battle with the devil himself to earn a chance to "live as a God", and put a permanent end to the evils of the mine. Other books can be important too; some explain aspects of gameplay or the the setting of the game, while others are just for fun.\n\nIt's a game with surprising depth and replayability for what takes all of two minutes to install. If you enjoy a challenge and can accept permadeath, it's the game for you. There's the sting of loss that comes with every death, as every run is unique, but that's part of it, I think. All those special items, every ounce of luck that resulted in that one of a kind character in its one of a kind run. It's a special experience every time, not in spite of the loss, but because of it.","July 6, 2015","true","23.1"," 70 of 73 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","70","73","4","0"

Don't expect any hand-holding while you delve into the dungeons of this game.\n\nWhile this isn't on par with the wide variety of actions in a traditional roguelike, Barony already offers most of what you would want, from cursed objects, unidentified items, spells and wide variety of equipment. The first person adds some interesting ideas, making booze interesting and displaying some effects in a rather amusing maner... just wait until you get some poisoned or rotten food and you'll see what I mean.\n\nOne of the most questionable aspects of the game is the mouse driven inventory management. I do find that to be kind of a mess and would prefer to have the option to use my keyboard instead.\nA lot of the fights will also require you to be reactive. Since everything happens in real time, you won't have time to think and ponder your equipment choices for too long.\n\nI have yet to try the multi-player portion of the game and will probably update my review accordingly.\n\nAs it stands I do consider this game to be the best first person roguelike experience I've ever had, right in front of Delver.","June 27, 2015","true","2.0"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

It's a glorious throwback to the older style of games that gave no craps about "lives" or "checkpoints" or anything of the sort. All you have with you is what you can scavenge off of enemies and buy from merchants in a procedurally generated dungeon full of creatures that would love nothing more than to eat your face. And your sword. And all of your money. A good emphasis on combat, but it also wants you to keep food, ammunition, water, and all of your basic resources in mind as well. There's meat in the caves just waiting to be sliced off rats and water to be turned from rusty faucets-which incidentally may be guarded by a really ornery skeleton mage or another plinky little rat.\n\nPros:\n-Gorgeous style of 16x16 textures. This ain't Minecraft. This is more like Dungeons and Dragons. Memorable and well drawn.\n-Really satisfying combat and animations. The slight head swing during attacks adds the perfect amount of immersion.\n-The music is really fitting and enjoyable.  Somewhat scarce for variety, but that may be an early opinion. There's always just playing a YouTube playlist of other music you know ;)\n-Local AND ONLINE MULTIPLAYER! Take yourself and 3 of your buddies to form that awesome adventuring party you've always wanted... until one of you is crushed by a rock and the other 3 are eaten by a minotaur. :D\n\nCons:\n-Movement is a tad slow, especially on "slower" characters like Wizards. Best be ready to take on that skeleton firsthand or he may be up in your face before you can turn around to him.\n-A lack of any sort of third person. This is a personal view, just because I'd like to see my bangin' Wizard in all of his fresh gear swing at an enemy instead of just seeing my weapon. Not a big deal, just a personal preference.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIt's basically what NetHack would be if it wasn't text-based, not to mention a heck of a lot more accessible.\n\nThe only things I could even think of that would make it even better is perhaps an overworld or moar adventure after you beat the boss. Though the replay value of this single setup is enough to have you keep coming back for more brutal loot-grabbing for quite a while.\n\nVery pretty, very fun, very cheap.

However, this is a review and I have many good things and some bad things to say about this game.  Beginning with the good.\n\nGood Stuff\nBarony is a genuinely challenging and fun game to play.  This game has a ton of items with all kinds of attributes, melee weapons, staffs, bows, crossbows, levitation, water walking, and much more great stuff.  Also, this game comes with what I think is one of the coolest identifying systems I have ever seen in their appraisal technique.  Furthermore, this game comes packed with some sweet spells for you to use.  I even really love the steep learning curve on this game.  BUT, with all that good stuff being said, I think the developers could make it one of the best games of it's kind if they fixed a few things that I will outline here.\n\nBad Stuff\nBarony RARELY lets you actually use some of the best spells in the game, and on top of that some of the character types will never be able to use certain spells at all throughout the game.  I understand barbarians and warriors probably aren't known for using spells.  BUT, you need spells and/or ranged weapons in order to fight the last boss.  He literally can not be fought melee.  So, either you use a low damage bow, or crossbow.... Ohh, wait forget everything I just said, forget the spells, melee, ranged, all you really need is one of the super overpowered staffs which can be used by any class and literally obliterate any enemy in the game.  On top of that, these staffs run out of charge but if you leave it alone for a bit, it just RECHARGES and you can begin the pwnage once more.  These are also the best weapons to use on the last boss (the only weapon I know of that I can even kill the last boss with).    This makes using any of the other weapons pretty much obsolete in terms of most of the classes.  Also, there is a large difficulty gap at the beginning - and then - the game flat out gets easy.  I think the main problem lies in the item system.  You can actually get the best items/weapons in the game right in the first level if you are lucky.  Sure, there are gimmicks like the boulders, traps, etc to kill you, but otherwise you pretty much don't have to worry about any enemies once you get a staff and some decent armor.  I think the HARDEST part of this game is actually keeping your character well fed.  Food is scarce, to say the least, most of the time you are praying for a scroll of food to keep from dying.  This isn't a bad thing, I just don't think it should be your literal number one concern in a game like this.","July 30, 2015","true","59.7"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","22","25","3","0"

Controls are pretty easy to get into although you might have to find a sweetspot for the mouse sensitivity in the settings. With how overpowered the enemies seem to be, I'd recommend playing with a friend(s) and making a balanced team.\n\nMultiplayer edit: You'll have to do some port-forwarding, similar to how you host a GMod server. Someone already made a post about that if you don't know how.(http://www.reddit.com/r/baronygame/comments/3643l2/guide_how_to_host_a_multiplayer_game/)\nMultiplayer is pretty fun as long as your friends aren't ♥♥♥♥♥ and spend killing each other for 30 minutes straight. The only downside is that you have to re-host the entire game instead of having a restart option.","June 23, 2015","true","2.2"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

(no spoilers)\n- has a very good game feel, and is very variable gameplay as random maps change it up every time\n- first person roguelike is a good genre though can be unforgiving in the early game\n- developers are actively involved and will help in any way they can (mistersneak, sheridan, and turning wheel)\n- very good soundtrack\n- steam compatable multiplayer\n\nCONS:\n- monster variety is lacking in some cases, though maybe adding variants may help\n- gameplay can get repetitive if you dont mix up your playstyle\n- some deaths seem unaviodable though this happens in all roguelikes at some point\n- game is best enjoyed with friends, but has some trouble working in multiplayer\n- learning through death is a sometimes annoying experience but is necessary, people new to roguelikes should be aware of this\n- some monsters are incredibly powerful while its good fun to fight them, new players may feel this is a bad design choice but these creatures are KILLABLE, though you may have to wiegh your options so to speak\n- content is lacking in some regards may need more levels or trap designs\n\nand thats my review,\n\nbut please understand the game is best played with a group of friends and is best experienced with others. and while playing alone is often fun you will have a much better experience playing with others. and while this game is brutally hard for beginners, it becomes a great experience for anyone later on.\n\n\n\n\nas a sidenote if the minotaur comes a knockin its best you start a walkin\n\nand enjoy the game i definetly did :)","April 17","true","132.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

The player is thrown into a dungeon that is sectioned off into different areas, battling things from skeletons and rats to demons and succubi. While classes are offered at the beginning, they realistically only determine your style of play for the first few floors. Skills are not bound by class, and a wizard is just as able to train in swords and axes as a barbarian is able to train in spellcraft and item appraisal.\n\nThe dungeon is randomly generated in chunks, with equally random loot scattered throughout it. Danger lurks around every bend in the form of boulder traps, cursed amulets of strangulation and skull-thumping tolls, and if those don't kill you, your hunger will. Barony is brutal, but not insurmountable, and those odds can be evened out with a few friends; cooperative play is featured for four players over internet or LAN, allowing for pals to die together in the depths of Baron Herx's dungeon.\n\nThere's a few bugs, and there could be a few things better balanced, but what's here currently is very playable and very enjoyable for anyone looking for a first person dungeon crawler with freeform character improvement and various perils to overcome. A level editor is also included, so once you've become a master of Baron Herx's dungeon you're free to create your own.","June 29, 2015","true","32.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

Adjust 'Flags' that you want in your game, including: Minotaur, Hunger(!), Friendly Fire, etc.\n\nMaybes:\n=Perma-death. I like it. Some won't.\n=Voxel Graphics\n=(New!) There's apparently a 60fps cap now?\n\nCons:\n-Hunger is ludicrous. You will be starved every 3 minutes or so, and be lucky to find more than one to three sources of [filling] foods on a floor. Randomized dungeons are great in that you get to explore a different map each time, but hunger destroys that feeling as it forces you to bum-rush many floors.\n\n-Development team will take offense to anyone's suggestions and ban them.\n\n-Blocking only with shields. You cannot do a one-handed sword/axe/mace block/parry.\n\n-Some things just don't make sense. I can break doors/chairs/tables/chests, but I can't break the small, wooden torches on the wall. I can one-handedly shoot a bow while holding a shield. Weapons degrade, but armor doesn't. Etc.\n\n-I have to grab (since I can't break) insane amounts of torches just to stay hidden in the dark, thus slowing me down unless I spend 3 minutes dropping them one by one...which then I'll be hungry and probably die of starvation.\n\n-Game is incredibly short. It will only take you around half an hour to reach the boss if you're taking it slow. 10 minutes if you rush. There's only 25 levels from what I've seen.\n\n-Very limited beginning customization. This is the first roguelike I've played that didn't let me invest/randomize my own stats and/or create at least some minor form of backstory.\n\n-Dungeons aren't as random as they advertise it to be. You will see near-exactly the same maps over and over again, with exact same methods of exit.\n\n-The Baron Herx boss fight is 100% artificial difficulty. Instead of making him boss-worthy, they just put a ton of health on him and only two moves.\n\nMy Story:On ocassion, I would go on a rant with my buds in the Dark Souls chatroom about the glory days of playing Diablo II. I complained because I was depressed. Year after year, games began to lose replay value, co-op became a Hollywood stunt rather than a pact of survivalism, and the era of fear in dungeon-based gaming closed further to null.\n\nThis game isn't a Hollywood stunt, so there's that.\n\n5.5/10 -- The potential is there, but has yet to be halfway met. Buy it when it's under $5. Otherwise, you're going to be incredibly disappointed.","January 7","false","13.1"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourawinrar/recommended/371970/","yourawinrar","Shady","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourawinrar/","307 products in account","Alright, time for a more serious review. This game is quite an adventure and feels a bit like D&D, but the best part about this game is the exploration of these RNG levels. At first, I was kind of put off by the game because the combat is kind bland or iffy at first, but then I realized this isn't about kicking monster ♥♥♥, this is about exploring, looting the dungeon, and leveling up to prepare for this all powerful lich you're going to fight.\n\nThe combat can seem iffy at first, but to me it works and feels like D&D or World of Darkness. Hit or miss, however it's not RNG based. you have to be within your weapon's range or you have to aim in order to hit the target. You can charge your attack up and do a critical hit, spam the lmb for fast attacks, use ranged weaponry, block with a shield, let the attack hit you and hopefully bounce off your armor, or you can use magic and be like "NO *Zap Dead*." The game feels a bit like Elder Scrolls Arena, except rogue like dungeon crawler. That's if I had to compare it to other games.\n\nThe Story it's setup within the trailer of the game and within the journal at the beginning. Any backstory related to the baron can be found within the game by finding books to read or whatever.\n\nThe player's choice of playstyle is also there. You can use magic, melee weapons, and ranged weapons. Stealth is also there.\n\nNow here's the main selling point for me the procedural generation and multiplayer. If you are looking for a good rogue like game that does have some challenge to it and people you want to enjoy it with, then this game is good. Exploration is fun in this game and actually feels rewarding. You'll have levels where you don't find anything useful and levels where you get all your main equipment, plus there are secrets within some of these levels. It's great and the best part is, you can do it with your friends.\n\nAt it's price point of $7, this is worth it and offers some replay value. Anyway, HAPPY LOOTING!\n\nHere's my famous quote from one of my friend's D&D campaigns. "ROCKS FALL, YOU DIE! DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, OPEN SKIES, WHATEVER!

From critters, monsters, hunger, stupidity, traps and events like the minotaur.\nLike nethack, you stay dead. No loading save games or respawns here\nLike nethack, the dungeon is random so eternally replayable.\n\nBut...\nUnlike nethack barony isn't turn based. That means that the pressure is always on and the hunger clock is ever ticking. Not too bad you say? Well, it also means that you don't have the time to read the books or remarks because, frankly, you race along to get the next ratmeal.\nEven worse: while nethack was bursting with comedy (and you had the time to read and appreciate them), barony is sadly lacking in this department. And the ludicrous 10000 ways to die of Nethack was the only reason the permadeath was still fun. In Barony it isn't.\n\nSo after getting trashed ten times by a stupid minotaur that you can do nothing about, I sadly have to give Barony a thumbs down.\n\nBut then again, if you are a masochist, enjoy yourself.","June 25, 2015","false","2.3"," 76 of 139 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","76","139","9","2"

As for the classes I feel like the arcanist and rogue and a few others are very weak. There has to be a better combat system that would allow them to evade attacks or have some kind of counter to make them more viable, fun to play and balanced to the other classes in the game. As for the customization, maybe add more features to change the face and clothes possiblity?\n\n\nPROs Explanation:\n\nI love games like these, rogue-likes, its very simliar to "Wazhack", but with real time and first person point of view and other awesome elements. Love the RNG and possiblities when I was looking at this game. I was really skeptical because I was reading reviews of people complaining about the minotaur and boulder traps. The first two hours when I was playing this game, I was really into it- the dungeon is dark and it makes things hard to see and the boss talking in the background was just the finishing touch to it, I really felt like I was there (regardless of the graphics, I love them actually, nostalgia). I didnt die to boulder traps either in the first two hours I played but, Ive died to minotaur (because I was scared and thought I could fight him so I hid and that got me killed) a couple times thou. Furthest floor Ive gotten to at the moment is the 7th floor. The deeper I went I did die to boulder traps because I wasnt careful, they arent too hard to spot. As for the minotaur it kinda excites me just thinking about how I would have a minotaur on like the deepest floor and would be a epic race.\n\n\nMIXED:\n\nAs of now I heard that the multiplayer is a bit buggy and the mouse sensitivity is a definite thing but not major problem, but Im not really worried about that because im 100% confident the DEVs will fix this and even if the multiplayer isnt fixed right away the game itself on solo is how its ment to be played, for me atleast. Some of the classes I didnt find enjoyable, its not because it was too hard, early on in the game it just wasnt fun for me knowing I can only do about 10% damage to them per hit and if I get hit (which is like 95% chance you will in close combat) it will devastate me and do half of my HP or more depending on the class I am playing. Im sure the DEVs will balance this out or add a new mechanic to the game to make the other classes more viable with "counter attacks" or "evade"\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI really like this game, its gotten me addicted and I will continue playing it until I finally beat it atleast once and will continue playing more by testing and experimenting new things. The originaly price itself is worth this game to be honest, Im surprised at how cheap it is. Im glad I bought it when it just came out and was 15% discount.\n\nKeep up The good work DEVs, You made an awesome game and Im loving it!\n\n\n","June 29, 2015","true","26.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

It's the absolute closest you'll get to a 3D First Person Nethack. You can also say it's similar to Delver, except it is far more in-depth than Delver probably ever will be. In fact it pretty much has all the mechanics, plus more, of Nethack, at least besides a starting pet. You'll find people throughout the mines that can follow you depending on your leadership skill.\n\nIf you want a 3D Nethack, a more in-depth Delver, or a First Person TRUE Roguelike, Barony is a must.","March 26","true","4.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Then two more friends joined. Lots of death, and hilarity ensued.\n\n\nOnto a more serious note. Barony is a very fun game. Well made. Easy to pick up and play. But still challenging. Good controls, mouse works quite well. Multiplayer works good.\n\nCool thing for a roguelike. If your character doesn't die and you quit it saves your progress. However, my one complaint is you can only have one character saved at a time. So if I'm playing with my 3 friends and we save and quit for the night and I want to play by myself later, it will erase the character I used with my friends. And you can't rejoin that saved game. Sad day.\n\nOverall I love Barony. First game in long time that I lost track of 7 hours and stayed up until 3 am.

Which is a shame because they have some really good background story's and just nice litle touches in it.\n- Edit - removed* because it was already in the game\n- Boulders are way to OP. No matter how good you are and well prepared you can get killed anytime by a boulder when walking down a long hallway whitout being able to do anything about it except for useing a teleportation scroll if you have one atleast.\n-food is sometimes nowhere to be seen. Its not a big problem its just sometimes i can't find food for like 2 floors meaning i die because of bad luck.\n\nFor the rest its allot of fun for a low price.\n\nEdit: The developers actually read my review and made an option in the menu to turn of the traps and hunger.

It is generally good, enjoyable, effective, except for a single disastrous problem: the hunger system.  The food supply is not scaled to the multiplayer experience, which means that you must constantly rush at top speed in order to survive.  That is not 'rogue-like' it is dull.  Multiplayer games are for playing with people, this game cannot be played with others.  The more others you wish to play it with, the less playable it becomes.\n\nEven the cheats which are supposed to let you change hunger levels do not function.

Not only are there hallways, there are mini mazes, large rooms, shops, gaping pits, and other things to break up the dungeon-iness. Music is enchanting. The new artwork of Cursed Edition is a happy balance between pixel charm and believable environments. Enemies explore the dungeon and fight eachother.\n\nSteamplay multiplayer doesn't work yet in the beta of Cursed Edition, but it's a work in progress (I assume the normal edition works with IP based multiplayer).\n\nThe other reviews are correct, it takes a 1-2 hours of dying to get the hang of the game (there are a few concepts like "apprasing" you may only realize until later). That being said, part of the fun is dying a funny death and learning from your mistakes.\n\nTL;DR you feel like survivor man in a charming fantasy dungeon, and it's great.","February 13","true","12.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ah! that’ll learn you stupid table”. He walked right to the gate, pulled the lever and climbed down the ladder. “Well then, this is a fine dungeon indeed ! A bit dark mind, but overall fine looking. Uh what’s this then ?” Lord Flix picked up a queer looking stone off the ground and looked deeply into it, like way more than a sane person would. I mean it’s just a rock. “Hum, a rock. Wonder if I can throw it” fwooooop thunk. “Why yes I can”. But Flix’s untimely and rash rock throwing catched the gaze of a vile skeleton. They both looked into each other’s eyes, bloodlust was in the air. He knew that this ungodly abomination would have ill intent towards him. They would have to fight. “Roight, have at thee vile undead !” whack whack whack “Wait, how do I use my shield ? Gaaarrffffh” Alas ! If only Lord Flix knew how to parry the many swords strike that fell on him he might live today. But it was not so….\n\nThus begat the adventure of Lord Flix II.\n\n“Right ! Better do some shield trainning then, I don’t wanna die again” and he did, a lot, a lot. With renewed inspiration and courage he went down the ladder just like his predecessor. “Hum a rat, I guess I can take on a rat” whack whack “WOOO I killed my first thing ! I am mighty indeed !” For a long time Lord Flix II simply wandered aimlessly, never encountering another soul. But his resolve was put to the test; he could not see any monsters, but he could hear them. The queer, unnerving sound that only a vile beast of the underworld could make. “Screw me ! Where you at monsters ? Came at me bra!” Still no sign of life, yet the eldritch sound was there, always there. “Uh what’s this then ? A hole in the celling ? Why that looks interes…” BLAAM. A giant boulder fell of the hole and squashed mighty Lord Flix II to death.\n\nThus begat the adventure of Lord Flix III\n\n“Mmmkay, in retrospect that was fairly predictable”. For Lord Flix III knew of the dire end of both his predecessors, somehow, because of magic maybe ? Yeah let’s go with magic. Anyhoo you know the drill, down the ladder we go ! “ He wandered thither and hither, slayed a bunch of rats and skeleton along the way. He felt mighty, powerful, and emboldened by the knowledge he gathered from they who dwelt here afore him. “Well would you look at that, a fountain ! Why that’s not suspicious in any way, nooooooope” With that in mind our handsome hero drank deep from the fountain, assured that he would receive some boom for a kindly spirit or something. Alas ! It was not so, to nobody’s surprise. We never said that the Flix bloodline was particuarly smart y’know. He felt quite dizzy from the water, perhaps some foul wizard had cast a vile spell on it ? Suddenly he realized he wasn’t alone, sharing the room with him was a naked blue lady. Because that’s not weird or anything. “You wot ? Where’d you came from ? Why are you laughing ? Hold on there keep your distance I don’t thrust you” Slaaaaaaap ! “Did you just slapped me ? Oh hell no, Imma thrust my spear right into your face you dumb blue lady !” he paused for a second and thought about what he said “Wait, that came out wrong, meh, scew it” But Lord Flix III did not know that this blue lady was in fact a dreaded Succubus, the vile seductress from beyond the veil of reality ! A mighty opponent indeed ! Anyway you probably know where this is going.\n\nThus begat the adventure of Lord Flix IV\n\nAnd down the ladder we go ! But this time to our fiercely awesome hero’s surprise the first door was locked ! “Whatever shall I do ! “ He tried and tried and tried to open it to no success. “Wait, damnit I’m such an idiot ! I can just bash the damn thing”. And he did, and he also felt really dumb, ‘cause you know, the solution was obvious. Anyway after a bit of exploring he ended up in a dark maze-like part of the dungeon. He didn’t want to sacrifice his shield for a torch even though he had collected like, an ungodly amount of the damned thing. He slowed down wary and looking everywhere for any sign of ambush. He might have been carefull but two skeletons did ambushed him anyway. “GAAARRGGDFDFJH  ARE YOU KIDDING ME YOU SUNAVA….” whack whack.\n\nThus Ended the life of Lord Flix IV, and also this “review”\n\nThat’s a good game, that ! Well if you like 3D maze-like dungeon, and rogue-like elements, and permadeath. Also for the love of god, stock up on light sources, mind the celling and watch out for blue ladies in fountains.","December 24, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

You get Classic dungeon style play with all the classic fixings, i.e. basic stuff of a basic rpg with a touch of the technical stuff of your modern rpg. This I would recommend to a group of up to four players that have previous experience with rpg games. I wouldn't let it discourage a die hard new player either though. Although death will happen alot, (you've been warned) it's worth the trouble once you get the hang of it.\n\nLong version review\nOut of the box it is what the video portrays it to be more or less. It tells you a story in text right when you first start up the game, and you get basic graphics options when you go to adjust them at the main menu, nothing seriously advanced. (I tend to adjust graphics as soon as I start a new game up) It's not graphics heavy, but full screen sometimes just isn't really "full screen" although for seven bucks you can't complain much on that. I tweaked my graphics at one point to a funny setting that left me fighting to adjust it to normal perameters, but with a little bit of work with the default.cfg file I restored it back to original settings. After getting that squared away I finally got to start up a game. I was able to create a character right after clicking "new game" and name it and select from some "precut cookie cutter" cosmetics for said character, later finding out that those same options were also applicable to other class characters. Granted their is a good selection worth of classes I have yet to get to them all in the two hours that I've messed with it, still not alot to choose from in the looks department... still it's a seven dollar game so it is what is. It implements some things that I feel that some dungeon crawlers of my time as a kid was missing. Such as locked doors being able to beat them down cause you can't pick the lock, or grabbing torches from walls to keep in inventory or to use in off hand instead of a shield. If you have a habit of running backwards and fighting at the same time I highly advise you don't in this because it's about the same speed as someone in crutches hopping on one foot. Levels are started and finished by a trap door in the floor, you must have your whole party in the short proximity of the trap door in order to continue forth. Looting is real as it gets, it drops on the floor it's gonna be first come, first served. So I highly suggest when running as a group you get that figured out so no one gets mad. It doesn't take much to die if you are not seriously paying attention, this game is not as forgiving as most any rpg I've played in my life short of a very small selection of titles. Be mindful of what food you eat 'cause (if it's rotten/old/or something of that effect) you might blow pixel chunks. You have to identify items on a regular basis, the upside to this is that you can do this while you are doing other things, starting out the time it takes to do it is about 2 minutes roughly. dungeons are random always, there is no preset "level 1" or "level 99" from what i can tell thus far. Public multiplayer isn't truly populated, but if you're patient enough you can find a player or three. All in all for $6.99 a pop... It's one that I can say I won't regret, it really is that good ol' dungeon crawler I've been craving, but due to difficulty level I'm not gonna make it a daily game to kick back and play unless I'm really in the mood to just beat that unbeatable game. I'll probably revisit this on a occasional regular basis. So yes, for my four pack that I bought here, I'll for sure play my moneys worth and then some. Wouldn't doubt I'll still rock this game into my old age.","February 16","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was able to create a character right after clicking "new game" and name it and select from some "precut cookie cutter" cosmetics for said character, later finding out that those same options were also applicable to other class characters. Granted their is a good selection worth of classes I have yet to get to them all in the two hours that I've messed with it, still not alot to choose from in the looks department... still it's a seven dollar game so it is what is. It implements some things that I feel that some dungeon crawlers of my time as a kid was missing. Such as locked doors being able to beat them down cause you can't pick the lock, or grabbing torches from walls to keep in inventory or to use in off hand instead of a shield. If you have a habit of running backwards and fighting at the same time I highly advise you don't in this because it's about the same speed as someone in crutches hopping on one foot. Levels are started and finished by a trap door in the floor, you must have your whole party in the short proximity of the trap door in order to continue forth. Looting is real as it gets, it drops on the floor it's gonna be first come, first served. So I highly suggest when running as a group you get that figured out so no one gets mad. It doesn't take much to die if you are not seriously paying attention, this game is not as forgiving as most any rpg I've played in my life short of a very small selection of titles. Be mindful of what food you eat 'cause (if it's rotten/old/or something of that effect) you might blow pixel chunks. You have to identify items on a regular basis, the upside to this is that you can do this while you are doing other things, starting out the time it takes to do it is about 2 minutes roughly. dungeons are random always, there is no preset "level 1" or "level 99" from what i can tell thus far. Public multiplayer isn't truly populated, but if you're patient enough you can find a player or three. All in all for $6.99 a pop... It's one that I can say I won't regret, it really is that good ol' dungeon crawler I've been craving, but due to difficulty level I'm not gonna make it a daily game to kick back and play unless I'm really in the mood to just beat that unbeatable game. I'll probably revisit this on a occasional regular basis. So yes, for my four pack that I bought here, I'll for sure play my moneys worth and then some. Wouldn't doubt I'll still rock this game into my old age.","February 16","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It requires you to delete your save to start another game. I haven't confirmed wether or not manually managing your save files gets around this (I assume it does) but it's annoying that I have to go out of the game just to play single player between my multiplayer games.\n\nSecondly, some of the items aren't very random. Potions and staves have sprites that pretty much tell you what they do, it's very easy to metagame and in my opinion anathema to classic roguelike gameplay. I haven't been paying enough attention to say if the same applies to scrolls but my assumption is it doesn't.\n\nThe fact that you cannot rebind the attack and interact buttons is the most inexplicable and infuriating gripe I have. I can only assume that it is blatant incompetence that resulted in these being hardcoded, because there is no reason they should not be rebindable like the rest of the controls.\n\nOverall I'm giving this a negative review because the steam rating doesn't reflect what I think the game deserves, not because I don't recommend the game. As others have pointed out, it's a great coop roguelike.\n\nEdit: I consider the price hike unjustified. The amount of actual content added is minimal; the changes are primarily visual. Additionally I think there is too little variation between the new faces that replaced the old ones, although they are higher definition, they do not give the same distinct and exclusive impressions the old ones had.\n\nSecond Edit: The price hike never seems to have happened. Interesting...","July 26, 2015","false","22.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodyThorn/recommended/371970/","BloodyThorn","BloodyThorn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodyThorn/","565 products in account","I want to like this game, I really do. It has so much potential. Even though I am giving it a bad review I will probably keep trying to play it to get what I think I should be getting out of it.\n\nThe idea of this game is fantastic. A 3D Roguelike/Dungeon Crawler you can play with your friends like Minecraft. I want this game to be fantastic so bad that I'll keep playing it in hopes that I am just missing something...\n\nFirst, lets talk about the little "Don't Pirate My Game" message at the beginning. I'm on Steam. I had to pay for this game. Though right now I might be regretting that decision. It's really obnoxious, having paid for this game, having to see an anti-pirating message every time I boot it up. And had I pirated this game, I'd be laughing every time that screen came up, so what is the point?\n\nNext... and here's the game breaker... The UI for this game is horrible. Not necessarily the in-game UI, but the UI you use to prep your game. To be able to start your game, you have to traverse seven screens of choosing a single option on each screen. If you're playing multiplayer, and you accidentally try to join your host's server before they have it listening, it errors out the entire process and you have to start again.\n\nAnd you're saying, so? Skyrim has a 15 minute introduction you have to sit through, plus a plethora of character configuration screens just to start your game! Well yeah, but you play that Skyrim character for days, or weeks. Your Barony character will often last you less time than it to you to traverse those seven screens, click one option, click continue, click one option, click continue, seven times, each time... for a character that dies because a bolder rolls through the initial doorway and squashes you dead the second you enter the game.\n\nUntil the design of this game actually meshes with the play style of the game, by either changing the game design, or compromising on the gameplay style, I would recomend against buying it, unless it was on sale. I'd say, -50% minimum.","August 15, 2015","false","27.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

However, it has several balance issues and a lack of content. The class skills are incredibly unbalanced. Some classes start with skills like Appraise, which is an incredibly valuable skill that is capable of identifying items (and saving you from dying to that damned Cursed Amulet of Strangulation). Other classes start with not-so-useful skills like Swimming, which basically does nothing.\n\nThere is also an extreme lack of monster variety (the vast majority of enemies that you fight will be rats, skeletons, orcs, and slimes). There are also only six different environments, two of which are optional. I would recommend staying away from this game until it receives some more balance & content updates.","June 1","false","5.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I mean yea, delve deeper into the dungeon, but combat wise, it just doesent make sense, use your shield until it breaks and then you have no way to avoid damage, and if your for some reason a lower health melee character you may as well call it quits right there, it would be much better if there was a "counter" system, maybe as the attack animation for an enemy plays, if you attack they cancel, or something. Also, the game seems very bare bones, I got to about the 4th floor (I know, not very far) and had encountered all the same stuff as before, same loot, same environmental effects (fountains and boulder traps) there was really no rogue-like-ish elements to be found besides maybe the scrolls.

I didn't have any fun with this one mostly due to a shallow and tedious combat system (mash the attack button while trading blows since walking backwards is made too slow to allow for dodging), extremely dark levels that require a torch at all times which renders shields useless, and finally instant unpredictable deaths that ruin the exploration. I died several times from traps that I couldn't even see such as boulders that just appear at deadends or clicking on an object to have an enemy spawn right next to me that kills me in one hit. This is a perfect example of unfair difficulty. Combat in itself is cheap as you must trade blows, your equipment and stats are the only thing that determines success which is very traditional of very old school RPGs but has never felt right to me. I can accept defeat when I am outskilled but I cannot accept it when I lose simply due to RNG affecting which equipment I find or enemies are spawned.\n\nIt's a shame though because there's a lot of cool assets here and the overall ascetic is nice even if generic. The shallow ceilings are a bit of an eyesore but the voxel graphics are neat. Overall a solid roguelike held back by archaic game design and lack of originality.\n\nRecommended only for roguelike fanatics.","May 31","false","0.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I've only played it for an hour so far but I already feel that Barony's unpredictable dungeons, simple but satisfying combat, and dark atmosphere makes for some compelling dungeon crawling.\n\nDo you like King's Field? Ultima Underworld? Delver? The Elder Scrolls games for their first person dungeon crawling aspects?\nBUY THIS GAME.\n\nOne issue I have is that it doesn't support 1366x768 fullscreen. This is a very common resolution and it should be in the list. Better still the list of resolutions in the video options should be replaced by a drop-down box to select from. It would also be nice - similar to Ultima Underworld and System Shock - to have a "mouse cursor" mode could be implemented so that the player doesn't have to be directly facing an object to interact with it, though this isn't really important.\n\nThere are so few of these kinds of dungeon crawling "action-RPG" games that have ever been made. Sure, many crawlers have the fixed grid-based movement, but for those of us brought up on UU, Hexen and the like, we want full player control! Barony brings this in a solid, atmospheric dungeon crawling environment and does it very well. I feel like I've waited YEARS for a game like this to arrive!

I can say that when I first played this game, I didn't like it as much as I do now. It was not because the game itself was bad, but because I had the wrong idea of what kind of game this was. I was thinking that this game was a lot like Delver, a game where you go into the cavern and just kill everything in sight and win, but this game is different. In this game, the way of survival is mostly to NOT fight everything that you see. You have to choose your battles and avoid strong enemies at all cost because they can kill you VERY easily! Unlike in some games where the enemies get harder as you progress through the stages, in this game, the harder enemies coexist with the weaker enemies, which forces you to exercise caution! You have to pick out the weaker enemies until you are strong enough and better equiped to face the stronger foes. To me, this feel like a stealth game than anything else and I love it!  I love the storyline as well. I know a few crazy people in my life who should be locked up in a mine... >_> Lol Give it a try! And remember, this is more of a stealth game, so let the element of surprise be your weapon!","December 5, 2015","true","24.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I still think it has potential, but in it's current form, it just isn't fun.\n\nIt's insanely hard.  Not the fun kind of hard that makes you want to keep playing until you finally succeed, the kind of hard where a ♥♥♥♥ing rat can kill you in 3 hits from full health.  The kind of hard where nothing you find helps you, only hurts you.  The kind of hard where walking around a corner causes a boulder to fall on your head and instantly kill you from full health.\n\nI like the art style, and the idea is great.  It already has multiplayer too, so maybe I just need a friend to play with.\n\nI bought Ziggurat instead and I'm having a blast.  I recommend going for that instead of you want a finished and difficult but also fun randomly generated fps dungeon crawler.","August 1, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I'm old enough to have played and enjoyed (never completed) the ASCI rogue-likes from the 90's.\n\nYes you can disable the minotaur, and food, and traps, and friendly-fire (but it feels like the producers decided to not worry about balance, and instead of making a good game, just gave us an option to turn off  **** that makes the game zero fun.  So I turn off all the **** that makes the game zero fun, and find out the game is zero fun.\n\nI also enjoy playing games with friends, but they are not always on to play, so I like to play solo when they are not around.   I find out that you can not save multiple games.  So I can do one or the other, but not both.  So...... zero fun.\n\nThen there is the "appraise" system.  It's basically a grind that almost every other game out there gets around by using "identify" spells/scrolls.  And... the option to "appraise" is right next to "wear".... so if you enjoy meta-games that include not clicking on the wrong button or you get stuck wearing cursed items, then buy this game.  If you don't like crappy game interfaces, don't buy this game.\n\nAll in all, I enjoy spending money to support game types that I like, so I won't be ruing the loss of the cost of the 4-pack.","April 24","false","7.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gadzooks/recommended/371970/","gadzooks","Gadzooks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gadzooks/","707 products in account","Im so torn about this game. Im an old school dungeon crawl fan. Games like Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master. Ive also played my share of Roguelike game as well, dating back to the originals.\n\nEnter this game. Despite its very "minecraft" looking visuals (which im fine with), this game looked to be an interesting blend of the 2 genres I listed above. Needless to say I was quite excited to give this game a try. It seemed like a perfect match up.\n\nAnd it could have been...\n\nIf they had done it right.\n\nUnfortunately, the game doesnt feel like a good dungeon crawlers, nor does it feel like a good roguelike. There are too many elements they have added that simply takes away from both of these genres. For example, some dungeon levels are on a timer, requiring you to rush through them, else meet inevitable death by a large creature that will 1 hit kill you and moves and amazing speeds (through walls even). This concept alone takes away from the "dungeon crawler" feel as well as the roguelike aspect. Both of those game genres are based around the ability to take your time, pace yourself, explore, and making sure that every step you take is carefully planned out (or met with a careless demise).\n\nAnother example, is the sheer randomness of the game. Im not talking about the dungeon layout either. Im talking about in both a dungeon crawler AND a roguelike game, when you die, you always know exactly WHY you died. Either the enemy was too hard, or you made a foolish (or risky) choice that led to you biting the dust. In Barony, you will find yourself dead often, and much of the time you will be oblivious to WHY you died. (having to go back and read the logs of what exactly happened). This chaotic, random nature of the game is by no means fitting for a roguelike or dungeon crawler. Most of the time there is nothing you can to do avoid it. No amount of smart gameplay, clever planning, or thought out strategy will help you here.\n\nThe end result: Short play times, frustrating deaths (and gameplay), and no real desire to keep trying. No matter how much you learn, there are just too many elements that you have zero control over. Thats not fitting for the genres that this game is seemingly claiming to be a mix of.\n\nAnd dont even get me started on the 2003 style of multiplayer/co-op the game offers. Its 2015. Developers need to stop requiring their players to port forward and use IPs to connect. Yes, I can do it just fine, but in this day and age, when so many other games make it as simple as a button that says "join friends game", there is no reason for anything less user friendly.","July 10, 2015","false","1.1"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","1"

Others have said that it's not difficult to overcome.  I've had only one game where food wasn't the primary obstacle, and that was by luck because of a scroll of food kept me going until I hit a boulder trap.  The GUI could also use some polish.\n\nOtherwise it's a really well made game with more depth than you'd think at first glance.  I'll be willing to play it again once (a) the hunger system is reworked to not be terrible or (b) the author includes a system such as that employed by Don't Starve whereby the player can tweak practically every feature of the game to taste in order to allow players to adjust balance problems from their individual perspectives.","October 6, 2015","false","3.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

It seemed interesting, with enough of a challenge to keep me entertained. However, I was very disappointed with my purchase. Here are some problems with Barony:\n\nThe UI needs work. Even though Hunger is an effect, there is no meter to show how hungry you are. Only an icon that pops up on occasion. You become hungry at the worst possible times. And when you try to sell an item, it isn't straightforward. Half the fun of loot is selling it, and you can't. When items are damaged, you can't tell. There is no durability meter on items. They seem to break at random.\n\nThe game is lacking even a simplistic tutorial. It's irritating to have to figure out controls from online guides and the Settings menu.\n\nWhy is there a guy selling things in the dungeon? It makes no sense.\n\nCombat sucks. Enemy swings can barely be seen, so you can't time enemy strikes. And shields don't provide as much protection as they should. Shields in Minecraft, for example, were implemented very well, providing players a great deal of protection from enemy strikes. But the shields in Barony feel like they're full of holes. With weapons, swings feel sloppy; like I have little control of how far my swing goes. I have the modify the FOV heavily to find the right distance. In Daggerfall, the FOV was fine, since the weapon is seen swinging at a distance, rather than the hacking motion from Minecraft. The FOV isn't a problem in Minecraft, because enemies aren't swinging weapons at you. They just cause damage or shoot projectiles. Combat feels chaotic and sloppy; this could be remedied with faster movement, allowing for fast-paced dodging. This is how it worked in Daggerfall. Also, Daggerfall used a random damage system. Players could only determine if they are close enough to strike with their weapon. Blocks and damage were generated at random. This worked well. However, your character feels slow, and enemy strikes can rarely be avoided. In a game as difficult as Barony, a strong melee system is very much needed.\n\nThe system of appraising items sucks. Only the Merchant can reliably appraise items. It makes sense if the other classes appraise slowly. But if you have to wait an entire minute to appraise an item, only for the appraisal to fail, it wastes time, puts characters in danger, and takes the fun out of looting (My favorite part of RPGs, btw). Appraise skill should simply increase the speed of appraisals instead of increase reliability. It hurts people early in the game. Also, more items should be general items, without need for appraisal. In Diablo, for example, most loot weapons don't need to be identified. However, the only items that do need identification are magic items. This made identification VERY satisfying, since it was always a pleasant surprise to see what powers a magic weapon had. But in Barony, players are often left disappointed with their new items once they are appraised. Also, you should not need to appraise food. That's ridiculous. Food just needs a sniff and a once over, not an appraisal of value.\n\nIt makes sense that the game is a difficult roguelike, and that all loot and level progress is lost upon death. However, you should be able to save characters, so experience isn't lost. The fact that you lose absolutely ALL progress if you die is extremely frustrating. The game stops being enjoyably hard and start being frustrating when you gain XP, only to die easily later on. At least in DARK SOULS, you keep your level when you die.\n\nMana and Health recharge VERY slowly. This was okay in Daggerfall, since the designers were fresh D&D players who didn't know better. When Daggerfall was made, it was based on D&D combat. D&D combat lasted far longer per enemy, so high mana and health costs were okay. But in a Videogame, you need that health and mana back very quickly. In Daggerfall, the player could rest in order to regain lost health. However, you have no way other than random potions to rapidly regain health in Barony. And note that those potions might be poisonous. Therefore, it is VERY easy to die. Or you have to wait several minutes to regain health and mana. This slows the game's pace immensely.\n\nItems become cursed very easily, for no apparent reason. Loot becomes unusable. I cannot stress enough how much I LOOOOVE Looting in RPGs. So when all the loot I find becomes useless for no good reason, the game stops being fun.\n\nFor some reason, the mouse buttons cannot be rebound. The game feels strange to me, since I'm used to "E" to interact, RMB to block, and Space to Jump. But I can't rebind the mouse buttons to my liking. Not that jumping is in Barony, of course.\n\nTraps are very difficult to see until it is too late. There should be a visible tripwire or something hidden in the ground, but there isn't. Not even a subtle clue of any sort. So all your progress might be lost at any time from any trap.\n\nMultiplayer servers are barren. Probably due to several of the reasons I listed. Really, I see what this game was going for. I do. It has the foundation of a great, addictive Videogame. In playing this, I couldn't help but explore and loot the dungeon. I have been bored with RPGs lately, so for Barony to pique my interest, it is an astonishing feat. The description of Barony states that it is inspired by games like Daggerfall. But in reality, it poorly executes what games like Daggerfall did well. The heart of those classic games like Daggerfall is there; but it is executed poorly. I hate to give a low rating to this game, since there is an online community that still loves this. And the designers clearly cared about the project. But I think my money could have been better spent. Hopefully, the designers will pay attention to these reviews (As well as mine) and patch the game so it can become the indie classic it was meant to be.  The game is only a year old; it could still become great.\n","June 4","false","3.3"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"

I rounded some up and some down to keep it even and at the same time not spend hours jotting this down:\n\n16, 8, 21, 1, 4, 2, 2, 27, 8, 2, 4, 11, 2, 2, 1, 12, 1, 7, 30, 15, 0, 7, 2, 1, 2, 20, 20, 1, 3, 11, 0, 0, 33, 0, 5, 0, 1, 10, 11, 8, 4, 22, 4, 13, 0, 8, 10, 15, 5, 1, 1, 4, 9, 6, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 4, 42, 8, 40, 17, 4, 7, 7, 44, 0, 5, 4, 31, 14, 21, 8, 1, 8, 3, 13, 12, 8, 20, 3, 0, 23, 9, 60, 3, 6, 1, 7, 2, 17, 2\n\nCount:	98\nAverage:	8.95 Hours\nOne third couldn't handle playing this game for more than about 2 hours.\nCan only imagine how many left the game on just to say they played it longer for the review. I only played it for 15min then let it run in the background for 3 hours.\n\nWaste of money. If you like looking at something and smashing one button at it till one or the other dies.. You might enjoy this. Combat is mundane and boring, just stand there and trade damage back and forth. Some enemies don't even have attack animations. Blocking is worthless, it's not like you can block an attack and then counter like you would expect. Figured this would make up for graphics with gameplay. Being an old school gamer I tend to ignore graphics, but this combat is even more dull than Skyrim's. Just a junk garage game minecraft ripoff.  Google Cubeworld and get that instead. Yeah its a dead game but it's still better than this crap. Also google any King'sField. Can download the rom and play it with an emulator. You also have Legend of Dungeon and Endless Dungeon for your "roguelike" needs. There's good games out there. Keep searching. This isn't it.\n\nAlso this is something that may change but even tho you have an aiming reticle there is no aiming any weapon. You automatically attack straight ahead. Same goes for ranged or melee.\n\nThis is a general response to all the "roguelike" comments I'm getting:\nSeems to be when ever a game is boring as f*ck with mundane gameplay people like to use the "roguelike" excuse. Legend of Dungeon and Endless Dungeon. Roguelike and not boring. Specially if you put on an Oculus RIft for Lengend of Dungeon. Just cause a game is "roguelike" doesn't mean it has to be a boring sh*t game where you stare at something till one or the other dies. Should call this Clickerheroes 3D Prepare to Die Edition.\n\nPS. Don't use an excuse to explain why a game sucks and then expect that same excuse to convince people why it's good..","June 24, 2015","false","2.8"," 21 of 62 people (34%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","34","21","62","3","13"

Despite the 'oldschool' graphics, this may appeal to gamers who often stay far away from games with such an unappealing look. You could categorize this game as much as you'd like; but this game simply has it's own level on the scale of great games. Replay Value, 9/10. I couldn't tell you how many times I've played on new map layouts in the short amount of time I've played. Challenge, 9/10. This game is pretty rough.. I'll be the first to admit that I've died very early in the game on multiple occasions. To truly progress to the end of the game, it takes a huge amount of patience, skill, and focus. Not only are the monsters tough, but there's also traps, and cursed items. (which have different ways to hurt your character. Poison, Bound items, etc.) Not only that, but sometimes, doing simple things like attempting to drink from a fountain, will cause a random mob to appear. (Happened to me...Succubus *cringe*) And if that wasn't enough to already get you purchasing the game, there's also a hunger system. Yup, I know, sounds bad on paper, but honestly, it makes the game more fun. The struggle to find quality level food (yeah, even the food has problems with it. Nobody wants to eat a moldy potato!) can sometimes get you killed from an unexpected guest. Gameplay, 9/10. Seriously, if you're still reading, just buy the damn thing. The UI for this game is good. Some pros for this include, simple layout, easy to navigate, and hotkeys. The storyline is the only thing that isn't superb. To be blunt, it's pretty mediocre. Nobody wants to hear someone whispering inside your characters head about spoilers for what would've surprised you in your journey, just saying. But that's fine, the game makes up for it with it's amazing class selection. Rogue, Warrior, Healer, Trickster... and every thing in-between!

You'll panic when the voice talks about a minotaur or when your light goes out. Or maybe you have a heckton of cursed items. Or maybe that Minotaur that the voice talked about isn't just flavor text and now it wants an adventurer pie. Maybe a skelly just popped up in your face to say hello? With a spear? Also, maybe Funny Bones felt like being mean.\nThird, the classes are cool. Easy class? Check. Class that seems bad and turns out to be good? Cha-ching.

Right from the get-go pretty much anything can spasm into you a few times and you die, and that's playing as the warrior class that the game labels as "beginner". I'm used to Rogue-likes and games that kill you over and over, but I prefer it when it happens in a fun way and Barony doesn't fall into that category as the combat doesn't give you enough feedback visually. It's a shame because in this genre (first person dungeon crawling thing), Barony seems to have a lot of depth with an interesting item system, varied environments and such.\nI will give it this though, it's one of the few games that can make me jump out of my skin, because the levels are cramped and dark and when stuff can splat you in a couple of hits it's a bit nerve racking when something pops out of the dark twitching away at you.\nIn summary, it's not terrible but it cites 20 year old games as its influence but doesn't seem to try and improve on the user experience of those old classics, but rather mimics their technical primitiveness.","August 11, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is truly a game you need to play for yourself to experience the adventure first hand. You will die, mostly by boulders, but don't give up!

Easily this game tops the boards in not only my top 10's list, but as a game in general, and if you're still not convinced, it's better and more challenging than Wasteland 2, considered one of the greatest in the RPG genre, which says a lot about not only the game, but also about devs(who didn't even use outside funding to make this game a master piece).

Boulders roll into pits, therefore smarter than cow.\n\nThe games balance is a joke, some classes start with the equivilent of pocket lint, along with their trashy skills you can increase by simply playing the game. Early on you begin made of paper, but with a few items and abusing the appraise skill, you can remove the RNG of finding the cursed or blessed status of everything, including food. Joker > Healer > Merchant > Everything else >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Cleric\n\nIn its current state, it's a fairly buggy mess with ugly at every corner, but after some digging the devs are hyping a release that'll include checkboxes to disable traps, cows, hunger, and many more hinderances, as well as a graphical overhaul so it doesn't look so flat.\n\nI wouldn't pay more than a few bucks with it right now, but whenever that update hits It'd be worth its price tag.","January 1","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game captures the feel of these games and mixes it with 3D graphics and first person action in an atmospheric dungeon.\n\n\nReviewBarony is a dungeon crawler which is heavily inspired by oldschool RPGs, such as Rogue or Hack. A lot of mechanics, items and interactions are translated from the ASCII based world of classic turn based Roguelikes into a blocky 3D real time environment à la Delver. While the esthetics and first impression reminds a lot of Delver, this dungeon goes a lot deeper in many different ways.\n\nThe first person controls feel tight and responsive. Nothing is too complicated and after a few rounds I learned how everything works just fine. But even with the good controls, some things feel clunky. The combat in particular feels unfair at times. You can tell that the developers tried to capture every bit of classic roguelike and put it into 3D, but when it comes to combat, this gets rather complicated. The enemies are just as powerful as in for example Nethack, but in Barony you miss out on the 'luxury' of turn based combat. When you encounter an enemy in Nethack, you can think about the situation, look at your equipment and prepare your next step. In Barony it's do or die! Some classes can die in just a few hits from the very first enemies, which is sure to be a major turn off for a lot of players. In ordinary roguelikes the combat often isn't the main focus, but in a real time 3D dungeon crawler, at least to me, it is.\n\nThere aren't that much different items to discover, but the RNG gives the available ones a lot of variety. Every item can be cursed, blessed or have a special power. Food can be rotten or fresh and equipment broken or brand new. It's always a little thrill to identify a new found item.\n\nSpeaking of identification: to identify an item you can go the nowadays established way and use a scroll/spell of identification or in Barony you have the option to appraise an item. To appraise an item you have to right click it and hold the mouse button. Then hover over the now visible appraise button and let go. Depending on the characters appraise skill, the length and success rate of the identification differs. For example a merchant can appraise nearly every item very quick, right from the start. A warrior on the other hand appraises really slow and often fails. The appraise mechanic almost feels like the balancing for the unforgiving combat, so you don't always have to rely solely on your luck when it comes to loot.\n\nThe dungeon of Barony is great. Even with the 'Minecrafty' esthetic of the game, the environment feels dark, mysterious and dangerous! Every floor is randomly generated and is filled with monsters, items, special locations and traps. You can find a variety of things, from your generic treasure chest to giant falling boulders and succubus summoning fountains. Every part of the dungeon has it's own theme. After about 5 levels the scenery changes and also the general layout of the floors. The first floors look like an abandoned mine, but sooner or later you find yourself inside a dark forest or an ancient labyrinth. Additionally there are secret areas to find, which are tricky to find/survive, but can hold great rewards and that should make every adventurer happy :)\n\nLast but not least, a probably very important aspect for a lot of interested players: the multiplayer. Currently the only inbuilt way to play co-op is in a local network, but appearently the developers are already working on online multiplayer and a lot of other features. There is a way to play online, which is via Hamachi. There are guides on the Barony Community Hub on how to set everything up for online play. I tried it with a friend of mine and in my opinion the multiplayer fits great into the overall experience. It doesn't ruin the atmosphere and even with two players, the game is still really challenging. At some points it may even be more difficult, because you have to split up loot, but that always  depends on how much you can find anyway. Some things are a little bothersome, such as no fast restart option when the whole party dies and no server browser, but if you have ever played some older multiplayer games, you know what's coming. We played for about 3 hours and really had a great time.\n\nConclusionBarony is by no means a perfect game, but even with it's flaws, especially in combat, it still got me hooked! Where the mechanics can't deliver, the sense of adventure, the atmosphere and the constant drive to delve deeper into the forgotten mines does. Every run teaches you something else, shows you a new creature or an mysterious item. And with a little practice and the right bit of luck, you will advance even further into the depths of Barony with every try you take. Should you feel like this is too much to handle on your own, you can always bring a friend or two. Of course it can and will be frustrating, but there is a lot to find in Barony and if you are a friend of classic roguelikes and would like to experience them from another perspective, this is the game for you.\n\nPROsChallenging gameplay\nRandomly generated levels\nGreat atmosphere\nCaptures the feeling of a classic roguelike\nCo-op multiplayer (only LAN)\nCONsReally hard to get into\nCombat sometimes feels unfair\nNot a lot of item variety\n"Minecrafty" esthetic\nNo experience sharing in multiplayer","January 5","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had a few strategies up my sleeve to ensure that I'd at least survive a bit longer. I came across an interesting room, it was well lit compared to the rest of the dungeon, almost cozy. Inside of the room there was only a fountain and another door on the other side. I open the door and to my disappointment there is nothing inside, just a 1x1 room.

The gameplay is a bit different and I find myself hating the differences at times, but it's really fun.  For example: I'm used to having a run command, a way to traverse open areas quickly, but there's no such thing in Barony (that I know of), and also I don't think there's a way to pause (say for spell selection) so you become really reliant on your hotkeys/hotbar being setup right.\n\nDespite these super minor annoyances it plays great.

From my perspective, Barony is one of the old gauntlet games with a more RPG-esque appeal and a minecraft aesthetic. It's extremely unforgiving, and you should expect to die a lot until you learn how to handle various situations (Minotaur, how to spot and avoid boulder traps, etc). Even though you'll probably do better solo, it's best played with teammates in a LAN environment (or online if that really floats your boat). Overall I've had a blast playing it so far, and would gladly pay double the price for it (though since I'm the one buying multiple copies for my friends so we can play, I'm glad it's not).","July 31, 2015","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The runs tend to be pretty short, but the challenge and variety makes them pretty great. Barony gave me way more enjoyment than I expected.\n\nI've had more than a hundred runs and haven't made it past the 5th or 6th floor. Always something ready to kill you. Often not the same thing as the last few runs.\n\nI wish the minotaur was a bit slower. I'd like to feel like I have some kind of chance when he comes after me. He is probably the most likely ending of my runs; maybe like 20%.\n\nCritically, it'd be nice if the levels weren't so square, had less predictable layouts and a much greater variety of monsters.\n\nI certainly haven't figured out how to win so far, but I really enjoy playing as the merchant so I can appraise everything, but it also makes the drops more important; and thus the runs a little bit less predictable. Maybe that's why I have problems getting far too. Hard to win when you're bringing rocks to a sword fight.","July 31, 2015","true","77.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Best played with friends!","June 3","true","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If not, here's my advice:\n\n1) Disable the minotaur that has the ability to teleport to your location every few minutes but for some reason doesn't just kill you outright in the beginning\n2) Disable hunger, which pops up more often than a diabetic's\n3) Use ranged weapons whenever possible because the melee system is about as refined as Minecraft's\n\nAlso, ignore the comparisons drawn in the description. While it has a few features of Nethack (procedurally generated levels and permanent death) it is not a roguelike. While it is a dungeon crawler like Ultima Underworld, the combat isn't even that sophisticated, not to mention the utter lack of content or side stories in comparison. System Shock is also more sophisticated in terms of combat and mobility and the game has essentially nothing in common with Daggerfall other than having repetitive dungeons and character sheets.\n\nWhat you are getting, for better or worse, is a first-person, real-time Nethack with co-op, that is hard in even less believable ways than Nethack. Without turning the minotaur off, just imagine playing Nethack with a Nethack minotaur that appears based on a timer instead of turns, regardless of level, and who can walk through walls. Without turning the hunger off, imagine getting hungry at about the same rate as you do in Nethack but in real time. Who gets hungry 5 minutes after eating a fist of ham? Do you?\n\nRegardless, the game is successful in other ways. You will improve as a player with every playthrough, just like Nethack, and unlike Nethack it has multiplayer which I suspect was the point of the whole thing in the first place. The game has also been rather stable on all my Windows computers, though I can't speak for other operating systems. At its low price it's hard not to recommend.","June 6","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Enjoyed the great adventure. At this point I only beat the game once. But I can tell I be playing again. It hard enough to be enjoyable and not annoying. Good game to play with friends. But this games takes hours to be beat and if you only playing singleplayer you only have one life ( without the life saving buff). great game overall. and first review I written.\n\n10/10 underrated game need more attention","June 6","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
