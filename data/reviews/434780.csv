It makes you reflect on what else you could have spent that $2 on, and really makes you appreciate the value of a dollar.","February 22","false","0.4"," 45 of 66 people (68%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","68","45","66","42","2"

I watched it three times in a row and still didn't understand, but became obsessed. I had to know.\n\nEven after playing for a little while now, I'm 100% baffled by this game. Its strangely beautiful, the controls make very little sense, the bullets do really weird things. It's a glorious trainwreck and I'm happy it exists.","March 2","true","0.8"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","19","25","6","1"

Collect crystal d20's to increase the yellow something meter so you get more triangles or something. And press combinations of V B N Space keys to shoot things out in weird directions while moving with the arrow keys around rippling space backgrounds.","May 14","true","1.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

Most shmups have you as a space vessel, but you are some piece of 80s rock metal album cover artwork sprang to life. I would have preferred a more traditional route, but if you're going to be weird, go so far over the top that you end up in space.\n\nYour goal is to destroy bosses, but the real challenge to the game are terrible controls, poor design choices and giant hit boxes. The arrow keys control move you around in 8 directions, but you are so slow and sluggish. Enemies can move in a full 360 degrees and just aim at you. Under normal circumstances, this is never an issue, but you and the enemies are each so large that its tough to maneuver to avoid them.\n\nThe only real attack here is eye lasers that halt you so there's a fight or flight thing going on, but never both at once. You need to get to a corner of the screen, shoot then move as enemies pile on you. When you move there is a chance that your eye lasers will move with you like if you move north, the lasers will move north.\n\nThere are other attacks, but the seem cumbersome and complicated. They require two keys and your attack key to work and even then your eye lasers shoot at the nearest small enemy, so there's never a reason to use anything else. Think of that as the game's balance. When you're being rushed head on, your attack does the same thing. If you go to the top of the screen where your head is above the screen and then shoot, nothing happens. The eye lasers are made up of tiny weak projectiles that launch every frame.\n\nThe keybinds are bizare. H for save, G for load. F for fullscreen I can understand in a way. The rest is just spacebar and shift.... to pause! When I press F12 to take a screenshot in Steam, a chrome extension for developer tools pops up. That's an interesting feature. I was never expecting that.\n\nThe game starts with you one on one facing a boss who summons demons to hover at you. Even from the first moments of gameplay there are issues. At the end of the boss there is a glitch that seems to fire off the same sound effect each frame. Most developers would have the sound once, but whatever.I also took note that at the bottom of the screen you have a giant health meter at the bottom and the boss health meter is a small number in the right corner.\n\nI would say this is someone's first game, but I can also say its trying to be terrible on purpose. Its amazing this game can be 2.0, because as it stands now its cumbersome, tough and over complicated. The Renegades of Orion 2.0 is a valuable way to learn game design at its smallest levels. You have a simple game here and yet everything goes wrong with it.\n\nPerhaps the biggest sin of Renegades is that its just dull and uninspiring. You can laugh at how bad the game is, but beyond that, there's no reason to push on.\n\nOn top of the bare bones content of "just play" there is paid downloadable content. There's just not that much of a game here. Its more of an oddity than something that could be confused for entertainment or fun. I was done after a minute of playing, but for review purposes, I had to push on.\n\nThe game can be salvaged with some sort of score system to make it more of an arcade game. As a single screen shooter, there just needs to be something that's more engaging that lets me feel like I'm in control rather than fighting a tough game.\n\nThank you to my friend Blanka for giving me Renegades of Orion 2.0. Hey even if I dislike it, I still thank you for it.","May 16","false","0.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

Yeah, its really weird game (in good sence) with unique style, never saw before any game like this. Its not just boring side sroller, its something more... maybe new genre called shoot'em up 2.0 :D I got a lot of fun while playing in it, thanks developers for interesting game!","March 13","true","4.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

Takes a good lil while to get used to them.\n\nThis is not the kind of game you put a lot of thought into buying, so i'm going to keep this short.\nBuy it, its nothing complicated or immersive, but its just a plain old fun time. Play this to take a break from your usual AAA titles. Well worth the very moderate price tag.","March 9","true","1.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","1"

This is about arcade universal space shooter 2d in a world intergalactic and where you need collect some usefull crystals to gain powers or such to beat some enemies and bosses around. These enemies are spawn and come harassing at you from all directions very frecuently randomly to keep you in the offensive mode while you keep fighting your way towards the boss monsters.\n\nBasically shoot everything that comes to you and stay moving in the air dodging enemy fire which is the key preventing they take your powers or your life.\n\n\nMy experience while I was playing was quite facinated and pleased that took my attention with the abstract art show, the crazies stylized projectiles. Wierd thing is even after having played the game stays in my mind which is so fun though. It remind me to some arcade game I played in the past that can't remember now but this one was by far much better due his creativity of colorful orbs of light,etc . Grateful of who made this cool galactic game. Rated 10/10.","February 26","true","20.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

Final Boss looks pretty cool. Diamonds boost your powers to Beta Attack. Combination attacks change as gain diamonds. Once understand how combine the keys to attack, this game is so enjoyable, I had fun beating it a Second time in no Time. Enjoy! Last, I don't know why the screenshots are setup to put into a Xbox App Screenshots.
