Play it with your friend(s) if they're with you. If you're of drinking age try playing when you're drunk or very tipsy for a REAL challenge! You'll be shouting obscenities and slamming your mouse before you know it. The AI provides a decent challenge, so play it if you're bored and want to kill a little time. While the absence of online multiplayer is likely to be a turn-off for most gamers with a competitive streak, I believe this game's quasi single-player/co-op style of gameplay falls nicely alongside other similar niche' titles like Brothers and Never Alone. At the end of the day $5 is a real steal, SO BUY IT!"","February 20, 2015","true","0.2"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","18","20","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/341360/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","This game does have a good concept under the hood: but the lack of options and problems that occur lead to a game that just finished a little short of what I think it needs.\n\nIncluding Gameplay Footage and First Impressions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e308RQcXCqk\n\n+:\n- Against a human AI, first several matches will be fun and chaotic.  It's the kind of game that if you forget about it, it could be fun again at later times.\n- Look and music fits, and was fun to watch and listen.\n- Levels are distinct.\n\n-:\n- Maps lack of randomization for the hide spots. powerups are randomized seemingly (maybe?) but the fact is that you'll find a straight way of going about the level and hiding.\n- Dash control will taking getting used to.\n- Single Player. This game was designed to be a multiplayer experience, and it shows in the powerups and the AI. Seems backwards on always being the celebrity in single player.\n- See too many opportunities for strong game mechanics (character having unique ability, more powerups, some more interacation for the paparrazi to influence the field)\n\n\nIn the end, the game didn't do enough to appeal to be a lasting experience. After a few rounds, I was satisified, but it tumbled off real quick.","February 17, 2015","false","0.8"," 44 of 74 people (59%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","59","44","74","9","1"

If you are on the fence consider watching the link below.  They are playing on console what is literally the same game, there are no differences I'm aware of.\n\nhttp://www.penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/paparazzi\n\nIt is not a game I would recommend for solo play however.  If you are looking for a single player game, look elsewhere.\n","December 3, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
