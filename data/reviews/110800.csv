The game forces you to slow down and look for clues in order to solve the array of mysteries that you undertake. Having a keen eye and a good memory is imperative to cracking the case. The interrogations are truly the most gripping part of the game; nothing is more exciting than getting a confession after spending hours unearthing clues, following leads, interviewing witnesses and chasing suspects.\n\nTeam Bondi has changed the face of video games with L.A. Noire. The facial expressions in this game are unrivaled by anything currently out there, and they're not just used during cut-scenes, it's in effect at all time during the game; a level of dedication most becoming of a Rockstar Game. They're so good in fact that you're left wanting the rest of the world to be on par. I'm not saying that it looks bad but it is missing minor polish seen in other Rockstar games (I understand it's a Bondi game...) like limited damage on the cars, bullet holes are missing when a car or person is shot... and that's it. That's all the nitpicking I can pull off.\n\nGunplay isn't as sharp as Grand Theft Auto and takes a little getting used to but it feels right for this type of game and works just fine. The focus isn't wholesale gunfights, rather poignant, key engagements that mean something; you are an officer of the law after all.\n\nGive this game a shot if you like cop dramas, film noires, GTA, tacos, fresh and unique gaming experiences.","December 5, 2013","true","33.6"," 393 of 438 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","393","438","0","11"

Noire is a detective game, simple as that. If you're looking for another shoot everything rampage game like GTA just because this game is made by Rockstar then this is not the game for you. Sure there is shooting, but you won't be allowed to kill everyone in sight, running people over will affect your case rating etc.\n\nThe Atmosphere\nPersonally, I love the setting of the game, the late 40s jazz theme mixed with golden age Hollywood as well as a classic noir feel makes for a great mix, but while the storytelling is good, it's not all there. The story feels a bit like it's jumping around without finishing everything off, Rockstar gathered enough story for a movie, but not a 20 hour game. Because of this you will be left with extra things that feel like they are just there to fill up an hour of your time and parts of the story that are never properly concluded. This being said, the story has some great parts towards the second half of the game and does a great job 80% of the time, however the ending will feel incomplete.\n\nGameplay and Fun\nIt's fun to drive around and using your siren to move people out of the way is great. The car chases are exciting at first but end up being repetitive, as with all the chases. Shootouts feel this way too and there are one or two that will feel boring. The combat tends to feel stiff from time to time. For an open world game it is very linear and the free roam mode itself actually takes some working out to access. Street crimes are fun to attend to and interrogations are challeging. The clue finding in the game is brilliant and walking around the crime scenes never gets old although you will quickly work out the set structure to finding all the clues.\n\nSound\nThe sound in the game makes for great immersion, no complaints here really. The hint sounds at crime sounds can be turned off if they make the game too easy and the whole feel of the sirens and the radio really sells the 40s atmosphere.\n\nGraphics\nThe facial expressions are the best part about the graphics, I didn't notice too many hiccups in the graphics and if I did they didn't distract from the game. The faces of people look incredibly lifelike and all the other graphics are good too. The sunny setting of Los Angeles adds a bright feeling to the game.\n\nReplayability\nWhile you do have the option to replay your cases to get all clues and perfect your interrogation this game is likely to be one you will only play the story of once, it's still fun to drive around and do street crimes but the cases tend to be something that's best as a one time thing.\n\nVerdict\nOverall this game is great fun and a nice step away from GTA while still keeping to the Rockstart format. It feels fresh but also familiar. The graphics look very good for a game that came out in 2011. You will feel very immersed in the time period through use of sound and surroundings. The open world side has something to be desired and Los Angeles doesn't exactly feel as alive as GTA 4's Liberty City or Watch Dog's Chicago, it doesn't have much of a personality, the characters do. If you're looking for a good open world game, this isn't it, if you're looking for a good story with a mix of puzzle and regular shoot/drive gameplay and well designed characters then this is it.\n\nGet this if:\nYou like a good story\nYou want diverse gameplay that makes you think\nYou like the Noir settingDon't get this if:\nYou want full freedom in an open world\nYou want to go on a killing spree\nYou don't care about story  8.5/10","November 2, 2014","true","20.5"," 183 of 192 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","183","192","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/110800/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","TL;DR? See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:L.A. Noire is an open world neo-noire police / detective game made by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It features crime scene investigation, interrogations, arrests, and possibly, for the first time in the Rockstar games portfolio, police chases where the player is the police.\n\nIf you like movies such as L.A. Confidential (specially this one), Chinatown and The Untouchables, you'll definitely might want to give this game a try.\n\nPROS:+ Facial Animation: -The selling point of L.A. Noire is possibly the facial motion capture technology that was employed. It is this technique that makes the game's interrogations as close to realism as possible for the 'truth / doubt / lie' mechanic to work.\n\n+ Atmosphere: -The devs have done remarkable work recreating the wonderful city of 1947 Los Angeles. Although it may not be exactly how it was back then, it's still a large and magnificent city to explore. From the cars, the clothing, the buildings and the radio, Team Bondi certainly nailed the 1947 atmosphere.\n\n+ Investigation: -From examining clues to following leads, LA Noire delivers a great police / detective mechanic that provides fun and exciting experience.\n\n+ Sound: -Great voice acting, great selection of 1940s classic hits, a bit of radio news from that time, good sound effects and some very classical OST vibe. The voice acting makes for some very memorable characters with unique personalities.\n\n+ Playtime: -The game is extensive and will require some time to finish. From the main story, DLC cases, Street Crimes and Collectibles, there are a lot of things to do which is more than enough to make you feel that your money was well spent.\n\nCONS:- 30 FPS: -According to the devs, the reason for this was that the motion-capture technology would not function properly if it was not locked at 30 FPS. Be that as it may, most PC gamers would still expect certain games to run at 60fps minimum.\n\n- Awkward Body Movements: -I kinda feel they focused a bit too much on the facial animation and severely under developed the body animation. Most character movements are awkward and the bodies seem to move like they were made from cardboard or cement.\n\n-  No reward for Non-Lethal Arrest: -The game has optional 'Street Crimes' which can be solved by lethal or non-lethal methods (depending on the Crime). Unfortunately, there is no reward in trying to chase down a fleeing suspect and it would be much easier just to shoot them in the back. This disappointed me a lot.\n\nCONCLUSION:GOOD GAME for a GOOD PRICE. L.A. Noire captures the classical 1940-70 police / detective movies that once graced the silver screens but with a bit of modern sprinkles to it.\n\nWORTH IT?:Sale or full price, this game is worth every penny.\n\nI suggest that potential buyers of this game purchase the 'Complete' Edition which includes the DLCs because they extend the gameplay by providing additional 'Cases' for each of the game's chapters.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

L.A Noire is also very underrated compared to other games from Rockstar Games. Only problem with this game is the PC-port. The resolution was a little strange on my computer and unfortunately the game is locked at 30 fps. That basically means that it runs and looks  like the console version. I would actually recommend an xbox 360 controller to get the best experience.\n\nYou play as Cole Phelps, a police officer. As the story goes you get higher and higher rank. You move up from a police officer to Arson Desk, Vice Desk and so on. You solve big murder cases by finding clues and interview witnesses. The story is good and comes with a plot twist and a surprising ending. The notable thing about L.A Noire is the Motion Scan though. It is a really cool technique where you use multiple cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. It looks so real, and I wish more games would use this. In L.A Noire they used 32 cameras just for the face.\n\nThe biggest problem with the FPS-cap is when you're driving. The driving feels slow and laggy. However, the framerate wasn't a problem when I investigated things, and that's what you will do the most. You can have your partner drive to almost all locations (like a fast travel) which is great and prevents the problem. So if you're thinking about buying this game for the driving then I would say no, buy GTA instead. If you want a good action adventure crime game, then this is for you.\n\nIt's tough to decide whether I should recommend this game or not. It's such a great concept with good gameplay, superb voice acting and Motion Scan, but the PC-port is far from good. I think LA Noire is too good to miss out on just based on the port though, so I would say i recommend it. Pick it up on sale and you shouldn't regret it. I got 45 hours of enjoyment just from the story, and I still have many side activites to do.","July 23, 2014","true","52.5"," 87 of 96 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","87","96","0","4"

But there are some games that when you play, you KNOW that the sheer amount of creativity put into it and the expenses made to craft the experience and make a world has paid off.\n\nAnd then there's LA Noire.\n\nThis game sets a new standard for the storytelling experience in games, not only with it's technology, but with it's excellent integration of good gameplay mechanics and using that as a way to unravel for yourself the world and it's mysteries.\n\nThe gameplay involved in solving the cases is pretty solid, with you scouting for clues that will later be used in interrogations. Though the clue-hunting is little more than a game of click-everywhere-until-something-happens, the meat is in the driving sequences and the interrogations. The driving sequences make full use of the fact that there's a big open world out there and anything could happen. Simply driving from one place to another is a nice experience as you see in full glory the love and patience with which Team Bondi recreated 1940s LA. Of course these can be skipped but you'll be missing out on the side missions which dot the city from time to time and can only be discovered if you take over the wheels.\n\nBut the true flavor comes from the interrogations. They used this technology masterfully in order to not only make the interrogations engaging, but also accessible with some exaggerations on the part of the actors which was done on purpose knowing full well the limitations this technology could have. Simply reading the expressions isn't enough since you also have to back up your accusations with evidence. This requires some thought and patience on your part and you need to read the descriptions of each clue carefully before using them. Suffice it to say that the game is worth it for these sequences and there are a LOT of them.\n\nThe story too is quite excellent with many noire elements, plot twists and an overarching conspiracy. LA Confidential, the 1997 movie set in around the same time, was a considerable influence for the game.\n\nThere are a few negatives though. Some cases felt like I wasn't really solving them. Even though ALL the cases have definitive culprits, there were a couple of cases where I felt I was simply going through the motions. The shooting isn't very good. The chase sequences on foot aren't really great as there are some navigation issues. Though the game is HUGE with MANY cases and the DLC also contributing to the list, there's not much to do outside the story missions which somewhat ruins the fact that these guys toiled so much to recreate this beautiful city. The PC port, though it has many of the features other PC ports lack like a good options menu and reasonable mouse support, it still is quite wonky though I wasn't too distracted by it.\n\nMinor faults don't bring down this excellent game though.

To be honest, this game can be repetitive sometimes, but addictive at the same time due to a great storyline behind Cole Phelps. You really have to take your time and assimilate the cases properly and find all the clues to find out the real guilty. What make me really love this game is the 40s atmosphere, on the post-war period, and of course see LA and Hollywood recreated on these period, with the old cars, interesting places, clothing, lifestyle... The face MotionScan is something unbelievable for a game made in 2011, so original and novel, the facial expressions just seems like real people that you can understand only seeing his facial movements.  Love that LA Noire mention the atrocious murders of Elizabeth Short and Jeanne French (Celine Henry in-game) by probably the mysterious Werewolf, besides you can do two cases about these murders and investigate them. Surprising final part, don't liked too much the end though, everything can't be perfect.\n\nDefinitely, one of the best games Rockstar ever made, and my favorite in this company along with Red Dead Redemption.","July 15, 2015","true","31.3"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","51","53","7","2"

Noire has an excellent setting, Los Angeles in the 1940's, and everything the game has to offer feels very true to this setting.\n\nThe story of the game is very well written, offering insight to life in the 1940's overall as well as focusing even more on the lives of cops, crooks, and war veterans.\n\nGraphics\n\nL.A. Noire's graphics are excellent. Even though the game's a few years old by now, it still looks spectacular, and nothing in the game is boring to look at.\n\nAll the animations look great and it's worth to note that there haven't been better facial animations in video games after this game.\n\nSound\n\nFrom the sound effects to the songs and shows on the car radio as well as the music that's been carefully selected to feel right in different situations, everything in this game sounds just right.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are gameplay elements that will instantly feel very familiar to those who've played any of Rockstar's games before. But there are also many unique features that this game has to offer.\n\nThe game is divided into different cases during which the players are also able to focus on different side quests like dealing with street crimes and finding different cars and landmarks.\n\nQuestioning the suspects and other people of the world is done very well. Although, I have to say that on a few occasions, I felt that the right choices were a bit surprising to say the least.\n\nNoteworthy\n\nMy playtime of 38 or so hours includes just one playthrough with all the DLC cases included. I also did over half of the street crime missions and unlocked more that a third of the vehicles the game had to offer.\n\nI did come across a few bugs during my playthrough, but they were mostly graphical stuff that disappeared fairly quickly. I also experienced some stuttering every now and again, and the game did freeze two or three times during the almost 40-hour long playthrough. However, I feel that these had little impact to how much I enjoyed the game itself.\n\nThe game does require for the player to log in to a Rockstar Social Club account, but it is possible to choose a "Default" account for which the player doesn't have to provide any personal information and which requires no email verification or the like.","October 12, 2014","true","38.2"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","44","50","0","0"

The similarities between the two are remarkable, although I'm guessing most of the inspiration originates from the books the movie was based on. LA Noire is not without its problems, but if you approach it thinking it's more like an interactive movie than a video game, you'll probably enjoy it. It just oozes atmosphere and setting. The acting is really good, and due to the incredible facial animations it's not just voice acting that you're watching.  You'll probably recognize various actors from other roles they've played (mostly on TV). It's really like nothing else I've experienced in a video games.\n\nThe problem is the gameplay. There's a few parts to it: finding clues, questioning/interrogating witnesses and suspects, and fighting/driving. Finding clues isn't all that bad, although it can get kind of tedious. Questioning people is the fun part, as you have to pay attention to character's facial expressions (that originate from the actual actor that played the part). The combat, however, is pretty bad. It's clunky, shallow, and repetitive. Fortunately, it's not a major part of the game, so it's bearable.\n\nOverall, if you want to enjoy gritty, noire detective stuff, this game is for you.","July 18, 2013","true","2.9"," 49 of 60 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","49","60","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quinstol/recommended/110800/","quinstol","Tukka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quinstol/","240 products in account","What a frustrating and disappointing game.\n\nThe most basic flaw with the game is the poor and inconsistent logic that's used to govern interrogations, which is the game's primary mechanic and conceit.\n\nInterrogations work like this: you ask a witness or suspect about a topic, and he gives a response, at which point you have to choose between three options to characterize that reply -- Truth, Doubt, or Lie. If you choose Lie, you must select a piece of evidence that contradicts the interviewee's statement. A correct choice nets you experience and possibly a new clue or lead, while a failure may shut down the rest of the interrogation.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes you will have evidence that suggests a person is lying, but the game expects you to choose Doubt instead. Other times, the game expects you to accuse the interviewee of lying in cases where you're not calling out a specific lie, or where the evidence that the game wants you to use to substantiate the accusation does not clearly contradict the interviewee's lie.\n\nHere is an example; I'll be a little vague and change some names and details so it shouldn't be too much of a spoiler:\n\nTowards the end of a case, I was in a room with a crook that we'll call Tony. In Tony's office I found some clues, including some forged documents that was noted as having come from a corrupt businessman that I'll call Levy, as well as hard evidence that Tony had leverage over Levy. Also worth noting is that I had interviewed Levy earlier, and Levy's records helped lead me to Tony's location.\n\nDuring my interview with Tony, my character asked for information about co-conspirators -- this is apparently so you can learn about Levy, in case the player has not already encountered him in the course of the investigation. Tony stonewalls, saying he acted alone. To me, the correct response to this would be to call him out on the lie, and cite either the forgeries (which is noted as being Levy's work), or the evidence that shows that Tony has leverage over Levy (though it's really both of these pieces of evidence COMBINED that make Tony's lie obvious). But no, the "correct" response is to Doubt, which gets Tony to give up Levy as co-conspirator.\n\nIn the follow-up question to that, my character asked who Levy is and where I can find him. This is completely stupid as my character had already interviewed Levy and knows exactly where he is. The stupidity is then compounded when Tony claims that Levy is one of the gangsters I shot dead on my way in to Tony's office. However, as a player I couldn't think of any evidence I could cite that contradicts that absurd lie ("the fact that I know Levy's face" is not a selectable piece of evidence in my notebook) so I selected Doubt. Wrong answer. Apparently, THIS is the spot where I was supposed to call him on the lie, by citing either of two pieces of evidence that do absolutely nothing to disprove Tony's claim that one of the dead gangsters is Levy.\n\nThe two pieces of evidence were a log in Levy's possession that showed that he sold the forged documents to Tony, and a scrap of paper that another detective gives you that basically just has Levy's address on it. I guess by the game's twisted logic, these two pieces of evidence each serve as a proxy for your own character's knowledge of Levy, because if you have the former evidence, or if you followed up on the latter evidence, you would know what Levy looks like. Instead that nonsense, why couldn't the game be programmed to simply check that I've encountered Levy and bypass the whole co-conspirators line of the interrogation, and just credit me with the rewards for having done the earlier legwork?\n\nIt's because the game has a system, and even though that system isn't robust enough properly handle the situations that are written into the game, I guess they felt the need to stick to the system for the sake of consistency, even though the logic the system ITSELF uses is anything but consistent.\n\nThe above situation also demonstrates how the game's writing is a bit weak. What does Tony have to gain by saying Levy is one of the dead guys? He's issuing a false statement to a detective when he knows we already have enough evidence on him to convict, which is just going to add time to his sentence. He's already given us Levy's name, and it would take a truly inept cop to not follow up on that and find Levy. He could be trying to protect Levy, but that doesn't make a lot of sense either -- I don't get the impression that there is any love lost between the two. At that point, Tony should either be keeping completely quiet, or he should completely sell Levy out, without playing any more games. The self-incriminating middle ground approach that Tony takes is simply a contrivance to create one more piece of gameplay for the player to work through.\n\nThis is just one case, but I had similar issues with basically all of the early cases. Too often you can have a solid understanding of the situation and the characters, but the mystery you face as a player does not lie in the details of the case -- but rather is figuring out what the game itself wants from you.\n\nThe game also has some other issues. One annoyance is that you can drive from crime scene to crime scene, but as far as I can tell it's fairly pointless and boring. Either you end up driving around recklessly in GTA fashion (which doesn't make sense since you're playing the role of a notoriously straight-laced cop) or you sit at red lights and navigate city traffic with overly sensitive arcade-style controls. Fortunately, you can have your partner drive to your destinations for you.\n\nAnother problem is that you can't directly review evidence you've collected after you've collected it. You do have access to a LIST of the evidence you've collected and a brief summary of it, but the summaries sometimes lack important information. I encountered one case where I acquired two separate pieces of evidence at different times -- both were documents that had a lot of information on them, but where it wasn't immediately apparent which details were important. You'd have to cross-reference them to draw a helpful conclusion, but you CAN'T directly cross-reference them because the summary of each document that you have in your notebook doesn't contain the information you need.\n\nAnother thing worth noting is that this is a bad port. The aliasing (jaggies) are absolutely horrible, and the in-game AA feature seems to do absolutely nothing, even cranked up to 3X, which for some reason is the maximum. The frame rate is locked at 30 FPS (apparently due to the technology utilized in the facial animations -- a reasonable compromise would've been to have capped the frame rate during dialogue/cinematics, but uncap it elsewhere). Ansitropic filtering is limited to 4X for no apparent reason. Screen tearing is rampant and there is no V-Sync option to address it. The game looks pretty bad, but would look fine if these technical features could be enabled and worked the way they are supposed to. It also seems to be poorly optimized -- I have a i5-2500k, a GTX 670 and 8 GB of RAM, and at high/balanced settings, there was still some noticeable stutter.\n\nI haven't played deep enough into the game comment on the overarching story, but from what I have heard, it is also not one of the game's strong suits. I have since learned that there is a plot twist that I would've found infuriating if I had put more hours into the game.\n\nOverall, the game doesn't have any strong suits, other than the quality of the animation and performances during interrogation scenes, and there are some nice period touches that help capture that Noire feeling. But that alone isn't enough to make a game, in my opinion.\n\nI've tried a few times to get into this game. I want to like it, but I just can't. It's a shame. I hope someone takes another crack at this type of game though, and learns from L.A. Noire's mistakes.","August 14, 2014","false","25.6"," 243 of 381 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","243","381","8","17"

Through the course of the game we assist Cole in solving various cases grouped into four desks - traffic, homicide, vice and arson.\n\nEach case is diferent, and may require different aproach, but the general tools we use over the course of the game remains the same - we need to gater as much relewant evidence as we can, and later, eventualy use them to prove our point during many witnes questioning parts of the game. To nawigate through this piling mountain of names, locations and objects we get a cool interface feature resembling LAPD detective notebook, that alows us to track case progress anytime we need to.\n\nThe strongest point of the game is definitely it's plot, settled in an alomost perfectly recreated 40's L.A. Cole's tale, as he rapidly advances through LAPD desk offices and departments perfectly catches specyfic atmosphere of Noire movies from mentioned times, with all it's moral ambiguity and dillemas. Above that every single case tells a story of it's own, often re-telling some well known crime-stories like 'Black Daliah' case, or creating a longer plotline connecting some seemingly unrelated cases.\n\nI'd strongly recomment L.A. Noire to any fan of Noire movies, and good thriller or crime stories. The game itself is quite specyfic and to be frank, due to the nature of it, the replayability of this title is very low (what point in solving a case, if You already know the culprit ?), but nevertheless it's still worth playing !\n\nPros:\n- Amazing storyline based on 40's and 50' film Noires.\n- Game with one of the most convincing characters in history of VG.\n- Engine simulating real facial expresions and body language.\n- Story set in almost perfectly recrated L.A. from around mid 40's.\n- more than 90 historicaly correct car models to drive !\n\nCons:\n- Extremely low replayability (due to the nature of the game)\n- Huge amount of cinematic breaks and introductions slowing the pace of action.\n- Controls may feel somewhat curde","December 8, 2013","true","41.1"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","28","30","0","0"

It was a change from their usual games and quite a brave move.I thought this was gonna be a game nobody would remember,but boy was i wrong...\n\nCategories        Details                Story        In LAN you play as an LAPD cop and later detective named Cole Phelps a former war hero in WW II. LAN is set in the Los Angeles of 1947 which has been created beautifully.In the game you start up as a cop and later get promoted due to your notable breakthroughs.At first it seem LAN has no story and it's just random cases which you have solve but later on as you proceed you unravel a story of army surplus Morphine racketeering and land bussiness scam which has Cole personally involved as his former army freinds are being murdered.It also features many sub-plots and also shows past incidents of Cole's life in the army which forms a major part of the  plot. The game's story is very well told,the way each case in the later part of the game coincides with the plot revolving around the protagonist is wonderful.The cases which are not related to the main plot are very well told as well and most of them are inspired from real life crimes which kinda gives you creeps when you play the missions featuring gruesome murders.\nThe voice acting and facial acting is very well done as well. Yes i said facial acting. Team Bondi has used some technology using multiple cameras and used the real expressions of the actors in the game which along with good voice acting adds to the atmosphere. When the characters talk you feel like they are real people.It is one great feature of L.A Noire.\n\nSCORE: 9/10                 Gameplay        The gameplay of LAN is simply unique.The gamplay ranges from gun fights,melee fights,foot chase,car chase,tailing missions(both in car and foot),driving cars,puzzle solving(riddles and stuff)investigating clues,interrogation.You play the game as a cop and paly through various departments. You start the game as a patrol man then get promoted to be a detective at the traffic department,then to homicide then vice and finally arson.The best missions are the one in homicide and vice.\n\nThe game's uniqueness lies in it's clue finding and interrogation.In the interrogation you question your witness and when you are answered by the suspect, you must determine wether he/she is telling the truth or lying. You are given three options in this mater, 1st option is truth which you select if you think the suspect is telling the truth,2nd option is doubt which you choose when you think your suspect is lying but don't have any proof and the 3rd is lying when you think your suspect is lying and you have proof to back up your charge.You may wonder how to determine wether your suspect is lying or not well it's by studying the expression of the suspect.As I told you earlier the technology used in this game is unique and the real expression of the actors are used. When people lie they make all sorts of silly expression(susupicious) and when telling the truth they look straight faced.If you accuse a person the of lying make sure you have got proof and from the clues listed in your notebook you have to choose the correct ones as selecting the wrong one will get that question wrong.Though making mistakes won't totally fail the case but getting less than half the questions on the case right fails the mission.Passing the missions is not the only aim,you are even rated from between 1-5 stars,the more stars you get the more salary you earn.Detucting these truth-lie mechanisms are sometimes easy and sometimes hard.You have to stay attentive in order to get the correct clues to branch to the questions. Wether they ae lying or not is mostly easy as while lying the actors make silly suspicious faces,selecting the real clue is a challenge.\nAs this is a cop game you cannot always carry around your gun on the streets and use it,they can only be used during gun fights.\nDriving mechs are simillar to that of the GTA games and you can take any car on the street and drive it,only this time you don't punch people on the face but show off your batch take the car saying you need it for upholding justice.Driving is pretty easy but don't expect to see Lambourghinis as this is set in the 40's.\nThe game has side missions in the form of street crimes that is crimes that have sprung up immediately and the crime is still in the act where you have to respond quick,it can be chasing the criminals or fighting them.\nThe puzzles and riddles are very well done as well, most of them really challenge your brain while some are very easy.\nOpen world is not directly in the main game(as u r actually solving a case at the beginning of all cases) but from the menu you can select the free world mode and play it but there is nothing of much interest.\n\nCrashing cars and damaging properties will affect you rating and minus your salary(though they are of no use in the game).Killing people while driving be penalised as you fail the mission in doing so.\n\nThough it has got some unique feature palying LAN at a stretch might get boring.\n\nSCORE: 9/10                  Graphics        The graphics of LAN are mordern considering the date of release of the game(2011) and are sweet to the eyes even now(2015).This graphics quality along with the facial feature technology used in this game for the first time in video gaming history is awesome. The city of Los Angeles of 1940's looks beautiful and is realistic(even features racialy biased cops),It really feels like your are in the LA of 1947.\n\nSCORE: 9/10\nL.A Noire is a great game for all lovers of adventure and action and suspense story and noire theme lovers and every gamer(until you r a hard core COD fan who feels that COD deserves GOTY).The game is really well done and is worth every penny.Also get the DLC bundle of this game(which i had,and it gives you extra missions).Playing LAN made me feel like a real detective.Go get it,it's a must have in your library.\n\nOverall:9/10\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's one of my favorite game among of any other games I owned and still replayable until now. So the storyline sets in 40's, this game made by Rockstar but you didn't expecting to be a gangster or a criminal just like any other Rockstar games but instead you became a police officer all the way to a detective in Los Angeles and your task is to protect the city by.... you know, solving crimes and stuff. For investigating the crime scene, you can find some clues around the place like blood, weird paycheck or any other interesting things for you to show some evidence to anyone you're going to interrogate. The game has very intensed motion capture to show the emotion of certain victim, suspect or anyone you're questioning whether you see his/her face like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off or really sad and its up to you to confirm if they're lying or said the truth. Graphics are good too for a game that releases in 2011 and you can see some tiny details popping out from the map. Talking about the map, its not really that 'open world' just like GTA series but there are some random activities you can do like chasing a criminal while you're on free time or collecting some vintage car somewhere around the map to keep you hooked up. Oh you can also change the game colour into black and white if you prefer the 50s Noir Movie-ish. So thats really about it and why not you pick this game up if you feel like to become a detective and want to play something different than the other. But I recommend for you to pick this game up on sale but hey thats just my opinion. Also I'll give it 8.7/10 :)","February 11, 2015","true","11.1"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","86","30","35","11","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/110800/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","LA Noire is a rather interesting title. It's a Rockstar game but it was developed by an Australian developer named Team Bondi. Why this is relevant is many of the developers from Team Bondi made an eerily similar game called The Getaway which also focused on cinematic action.\n\nLA Noire is unlike the Grand Theft Auto games it gets compared to. A big focus of the game is it's cinematics and it's interrogation mechanic. Where the player is required to tell if a character is lying or not. While I would say it was implemented fairly well, unfortunately the developers confuse you every so often with the range of options. Sometime a suspect isn't lying but rather just not telling enough information. And instead of selecting lie you're supposed to select "doubt". Thankfully the developers also implemented a lifeline style mechanic where you can ask the community what the most commonly selected responses are.\n\nWhile I would say LA Noire was an excellent game unfortunately it was an imperfect one. The game starts out exceptionally well and the quality of the writing stays consistant until the middle. After the homicide desk the writing begins to get worse and worse, to the point when you get to the ending you begin laughing at how ludicrous the entire thing is. I wouldn't say the experience isn't worthwhile but don't go into this expecting it to be Red Dead Redemption levels of satisfaction.\n\nIt's unsurprising to find out this game had two entire desks cut (of which 4 remain in the final release) considering the storyline remains just a little half baked. It's unfortunate to see with such an ambitious game, but since it was in development for 8 years it's surprising that it came out at all.","September 8, 2014","true","12.1"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","4"

But well, everybody is at some point back where he started, so I figure it out, why just don't write up the review for a game, which is in my personal TOP 10. Right ?\n\nWhen I look back, and check all the products, that Rockstar Games has put out, I'm not even sure if I'm able to name at least one, which was average or even under that. Man .... they even did a fantastic movies, didn't they ?\n\nWhen they try to make open world game, it's understandable that comparision with Grand Theft Auto is not anything bad.  Red Dead Redemption v. GTA. / Bully v. GTA. / The Warriors v. GTA (My lord, The Warriors are even better than GTA in some way) / and also Midnight Club for some reason. And there comes the L.A. Noire. New genre that R* step a foot in, and got out as a king again and again and again.\n\nL.A. Noire is as you of course know the detective game set in 40s Los Angeles. You can compare this to Sherlock Holmes games, and Cole Phelps will be still better detective. Story is so gripping that one case might drives you crazy, and then you realize that Rockstar is just master of art in the gaming world.\n\nThere is one thing, that I also realized during the exploration of LA which is really huge and more realistic than GTA V would ever be. However, the developer itself pretty doesn't give a flying f*ck if people discover beautifulness inside. I am talking about hidden spots and interesting places all over the Los Angeles. It's pretty usual that some devs puts spots out to player to see them. R* is not doing that way. They put tons of spots, and hide them even more than usually.\n\nThis game is filled with landmarks, and especially golden film reels which are pretty difficult to spot. Thing is, that even after discovering 30 of various world-famous places and 50 hidden golden films, you can go further, explore on your own, and discover spots that wasn't made for casual player, but for true explorer. I've been to LA this year, and I must say, that a lot of places that are shown in this game, looks practically same (not just landmarks, also the standard streets at some point) no matter the time game is set was more than 70 years ago.\n\nI've talked a lot about the town, but I have to be honest with you, but town is most enjoyable thing for me personally in the game. More than the characters, more than Cole and more than the story and cases.\n\nMore than 20 cases ready for you (which lenght of the one might be easily above 40 mins) 40 side street crimes, and enormous spots to discover for you. Great thing was, that besides the main story line, there was a lot of different stories going all way along and meet each other in the end.\n\nI've got to tell you much more, but I will leave it. I don't want this review to be another Saints Row 3 review of mine :X\n\n10/10","November 23, 2015","true","47.3"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","18","19","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TerroristsWin/recommended/110800/","TerroristsWin","Primary","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TerroristsWin/","237 products in account","This is the best detective game on Steam at the moment. You play as Cole Phelps, a veteran who went into police work in order to keep serving his country and dispense justice. As you play, you say to hell with procedure and take the initiative to solve the crimes the lazy detectives are glossing over. This gets you promoted to become a full-time detective, and you make your way up the hierarchy of crime investigators.\n\nI'm not gonna bother dividing these things into pros and cons. If you need a detective game in your life, buy it.\nIf you don't, read this review and buy it.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nYou're not buying the game for this:\n- This is a third person open world game, yet it has nearly nothing to find or do in terms of free roaming. Between missions you may accept a street crime side mission, but they often boil down into a chase, a car chase or a shoot-out, all of which probably won't get your blood pumping. Do yourself a favour and just follow the story; it's pretty long.\n- The combat is boring and generic. The weapons bear no real feeling of impact and you can take a lot more bullets than the bad guys. Melee combat is practically unexistant. The combat is merely a way of prolonging the game and supplement the story.\n- No reward or change if you decide to go for a non-lethal arrest.\n- The driving is nothing spectacular. It's far less enjoyable than in most Rockstar games in that it's pretty slow and car chases force you into just trying to keep the driver in sight until the game decides that he's arrived at his final destination. Occasionally you will be able to have your partner shoot out the suspect's tires, which feels alright, but you won't be aiming.\n- Interrogation is a pretty fun mechanic which is probably what this game is known for. You have to read the suspect/victim's facial expressions and pick up on uncertainty or curious claims, then decide if they're lying or telling the truth and reveal more info/clues if you answer correctly. Sometimes you'll be dealing with good liars that the game won't tell you about, who tell you their side of the story very rigidly and confidently, but without the facts adding up. This is to make sure you know have an overview of the case and it's a very nice touch.\n- Facial features and animations are great, since a fairly thorough facial motion capture method was used for every character and gels very well with the story. As a result, every character in the game looks like the person who performed the voice.\n- The game is locked to 30 FPS for the facial motion capture to work.\n\nSTORY:\nThe reason this game is nothing short of phenomenal:\n- Between cases, you will sometimes get a clip that goes back to Cole's participation in the war in Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbour. From the very beginning of the game, you'll be seeing these clips/flashbacks and they will play into the story as you progress. The way the game creates parallel story lines that eventually cross into eachother is absolutely fantastic.\n- The cases are often connected to eachother in some way; I can't say much without spoiling it.\n- They're also fairly devoid of plot holes and create a comprehensive and complete experience.\n- The job eventually expands into your personal life, even though it initially doesn't seem like you even have one.\n- Characters from the story occassionally appear in the side missions (street) crimes, which is a nice touch but it won't mean or matter much.\n- The atmosphere is extremely immersive and convincing; when you launch this game, you turn into L.A.'s top detective in a realistic city based on real places with real landmarks.\nThe music amplifies the detective noir vibe and is probably the final aspect that gets you into the role.\nEvery character wears clothes and sets their hair in a way that is true to the time period as well.\n- The voice acting is absolutely beautiful and convincing in every aspect. Team Bondi really scratched together some very talented people.\n\nL.A. Noire does what is does very well, and as long as you're willing to look past the FPS cap and just follow the main story line, you will be an experience richer.\nThe interrogation mechanic might get dull after a while; for this I recommend you consider what you'd answer in a situation and then look up the correct answer in a guide to keep you trekking along.","September 8, 2014","true","53.6"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

Stop reading, GET THIS GAME!\n\nThis is a fantastic story worthy of being slapped with 10/10, kudos and praise. Why? Because this game is like "Guardians of the Galaxy", it has personality, action and narrative.\n\nYou are Detective Cole Phelps, and are a badass at solving cases. You will run through numerous cases investigating clues and interrogating suspects, unraveling a conspiracy and a kickass story, and half the time your partners will "pull rank" or flat out refuse to do a foot chase and leave it all to you :P\n\nPros:\n\nOMG GRAPHICS. Did I mention graphics? This game has the most amazing facial graphics ever. It should be, because they use motion capturing on people's faces and you can actually see emotion in their faces!!! Once you play this game you will be disapointed with every game out there that doesn't come up to snuff. It is simply gorgeous, and groundbreaking to tell if someone is lying via actual cues in their behavior and their faces! The interactivity of the game, with player and character are grade A.\n\nThe gameplayer borrows alot from GTA, with cars behaving similarly but to me feel alot better. The gun play is clunky but intuitive, it doesn't kick you out of cover akwardly or just unwieldy to do sometimes. *cough* Mass Effect *cough*.\n\nOverall, it just feels nice and awe-inspiring to see the period perfect LA, based on real cars, on real settings and with distinct personalities. From villains to partners, you will loathe, love and grumble at people who feel real and you could have sworn probably exist in real life.\n\nCon:\n\nIT IS TOO SHORT. The usual benefits of getting a game on PC are the mods. Well, it doesn't have great mod capabilities and therefore the modding community can't mod new stories and there's so little DLC. I would reccomend buying this on console unless you can find it cheaper on PC.\n\nOverall, buy it on console unless the PC version is cheaper.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aps97/recommended/110800/","aps97","[ARX]AnthonyPS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aps97/","140 products in account","L.A. Noire is about a detective named Cole Phelps that worked in post-WW2 late 1940s Los Angeles. Gameplay is open world and consists entirely of interviewing/interrogating people, chasing suspects with cars/on foot, shootouts with criminals, and walking around crime scenes or area of interest to find clues and evidence. This is a pretty unique game since it's made by Rockstar, which is well-known as the creator of GTA. You get to be the good guy this time, including chasing & ramming cars that will be ended with you busting the suspect GTA-Style (remember Busted scene in GTA? you're the cop here).  Even with obvious low-budget graphics, the story was very well made and the characters expressions (face and voice) are EXTREMELY 'alive' compared to other games. This is because you get to judge whether someone is lying or not by facial expression/voice tone. Ah, if you're a classic car lover, this game paid a lot of attention to them. In short, L.A. Noire is a very out-of-the-box interesting detective game that is definitely worth the price.\n\nNow let's talk about the good things first. I'm no policeman and I have no experience in any police work, but I dare to say that with a huge amount of available cases and side missions, the game will definitely satisfy your thirst of 'problem solving' or 'mystery' or straight out 'detective work'. I definitely can't say it's realistic (apparently, shooting someone in the leg made fatal chest wounds) but it's...well-designed. The cases are all realistic with carefully designed motives and chain of events. You'll find the thrill of being in a crime scene looking for clues like footprints, shoe sizes, blood traces, injury marks, and other 'detective stuff'. You also get to judge whether someone is telling the truth or lying by looking into their faces and voice tone. Facial expression is carefully designed to show real-life 'lying' or 'truth' or 'holding out' expression (e.g. eyes looking left when lying). Bored of the same routine? Whenever you're driving, you'll receive dispatch calls that will give you side-missions. So yeah, the main advantage of this game is its well-designed gameplay.\n\nThe bad parts of the game is really not that much and does not affect the gameplay. Graphics looks very low-budget, it's as if they put all of the graphics money into character's facial expression realism. But in my opinion, it's still in the acceptable level. The weapon choice is also very limited, only Colt 45, Thompson, M1 Garand, and BAR. Since the game is not focused on the gun fights, this issue has miniscule effect.  And as a good guy, you don't get to do the legendary GTA reckless driving. You don't have to follow traffic rules and all but you can't run over pedestrians or ram cars that cut you off if you don't  want your case report to be ruined. Some of the cases are also pretty complicated, giving you a long list of person of interest and clues. This particular mission gave me the 'What am I doing? Who the heck is this guy? Whoa, now who are you? What's their connection to the case?' moment. But that's the fun part, right?\n\nIn conclusion, the gameplay is very unique and I don't think there are many open-world detective games out there. This advantage makes this game a 'must-play' for me and it's worth every cent. I spent over 13 hours and I'm not even a quarter finished of the whole game. The cons of the game is almost meaningless and it will not ruin the gameplay. I definitely recommend this game, it's worth it.\n\n","April 25","true","16.8"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

And not some traffic warden but a Los Angeles detective Cole Phelps.\nThe investigation process is the second best part of the game, after the story (see below). The search for clues will make you really punctilious and bring deep insight into all cases. The interogation is even better with the best game facial animation I have ever seen making some characters an obvious liars whereas others might seem honest. What kind of police officer would you be without chasing criminals? This takes me to the third part of police work and that are the gunfights and chases on foot or in cars. These elements aren't the main plus of the game since it's not a shooter of any kind - if you want to buy the game for the action only, don't. However, though these are weaker than in Mafia II for example, they are a nice contrast to the peaceful investigation and they balance the neat investigating with some action, which is important for you not to get bored from finding clues only.\nApart from the extraordinary facial animation the graphics is about average. The city of LA is really big and contains lot of hidden secrets, such as cars, sights etc. for completionist gamers. Though the city really is wonderful, it doesn't feel as lively as it might be. Apart from the cases and street crimes, there isn't much to watch. But that isn't much of a drawback - not many games have that (maybe the Watch Dogs will).\nFinally, the story. There's a lot to spoil so I'll take this just briefly. It focuses on many things and mentions lot of important topics, which make it really strong. As set in the year 1947, it connects the horrors of war and Cole Phelps' military history with the police investigations and lot of other topics, you'll encounter in the streets of LA such as drugs, racism, prostitution, rapes and lot more. I enjoyed the last Arson desk a whole damn lot because it shows nobody is plain black or white, evil or good. Some characters are antagonists, though you feel the morale in their acting, others have it the other way round. It also shows how thin line lies between good and bad, between friends and enemies.\nTo sum up - this game promises something quite different from others as you'll be playing at the right side of the law meaning lots of new aspects and a fantastic story. The weakest thing I can think of is that you cant skip the ending credits :)\n9/10","April 14, 2014","true","32.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Noire is a beautiful tale of the grime that lurks just below the surface.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThere are 4 main types of gameplay at work here the first is investigation, the second is interrogation, the third is car chases, and the fourth is gunfights. The first and second forms mentioned make up the meat of the game with 90% of the game consisting solely of walking around, picking things up, and talking to people. The gunplay and driving could both be improved, but they both occur so infrequently and can be skipped that it is hardly considered a real negative. The biggest issue I have with the gameplay is the "Truth, Doubt, Lie" function. The majority of the time you'll be going out on a whim if you doubt or lie. The best you can do is choose lie first to see where Cole takes it, and if you didn't mean to head that direction choose doubt instead. Also a lot of the time what you need to present for lie will be a toss up for 2 items and the one you choose probably won't be it even though it could work. The fact is though I can't think of any way to solve the issues it has.\n\nSTORY:\nThis is what the game is about. I don't want to spoil anything about the story, but just remember to never take a single thing you hear at face value not even the character you play. The set up is you play as Cole Phelps a war hero turned LAPD detective in the mid-late 40's. One of the best qualities of this game is the writing of all of the characters. Every single aspect of the characters was clearly taken and cared for to be formed into one of the best experiences that can be given to anyone who is willing to look one step deeper.\n\nSOUND:\nLimited repeated tracks with hit-or-miss voice recordings (some people sound like they were recorded in a cardboard box while standing in the middle of the street) leave much to be desired.\n\nCons:\n*30 FPS locked\n*Lots of random stutter\n*Large wonderful but shallow overwold.\n\nOVERALL:\nIf Phoenix Wright had an affair with the 40's this game would be what pops out. And I loves meself some Phoenix Wright. L.A. Noire deserves to be on the forefront of anyone's "to-play" list if you have a marginal interest in Noire or love a good  story.","March 2, 2015","true","27.3"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nexiu/recommended/110800/","nexiu","Nexiu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nexiu/","274 products in account","Justice always wins.At the bottom, there is a short version as a summary for those who don't like to read.\n\nPhelps, badge 1247.\nSo.. your name is Cole Phelps. After the end of World War II you return to the country as a hero and as one of the few soldiers who deal well with the trauma of the experiences on the front lines. You have always thought that everything is either black or white and guided by these ideals you are joining the ranks of police in Los Angeles. At first, being a simple novice from the proverbial "traffic police," you manage to get promoted to the rank of detective in a special department of the LAPD, thanks to solved case. From now on, all your days will pass on briefings, visual inspections of crime scenes, interrogations and prosecutions of suspects.\n\nMechanics of investigation looks like this: we arrive at the briefing and we learn what case are we supposed to solve. Then we go to the scene of the crime (most often we are dealing with murder), we are making an inspection of the place and we are looking for evidence that could be helpful in the case. When we are close to some significant object, the game tells us via a specific sound, so we know that in this place there is something important, of course, you can turn it off. Each of evidence gives us some new clues. After collecting relevant evidence (in which may include the murder weapon, bills, bank statements, wallets, pictures and others), it's time to hear witnesses on the scene. When you hear the answer to the question we asked, we can decide whether a person is telling the truth, if you doubt in what he/she says (though we have no direct evidence for this), or perhaps he/she is lying. After some time we reach the potential suspects, in which hearings can be supported by evidence found at the crime scene. A further order of investigation is generally subordinated to the scenario outlined by the authors, however, led by our hearings or visits to key locations can accelerate or delay the investigation. And don't worry, in the final phases of the investigations no shortage of gunfights and car chases, but if you want more shoot, invest in side missions and occupy a street crimes.\n\nWhen it comes to graphic design here is a little bit worse, though facial expressions and general appearance of characters fully make up for that. While the city itself has two sides of the coin: nicely presented (I mean here especially for skyscrapers, parks, alleys and smaller houses), but quite often creates the impression of a slightly extinct. On the streets moves fewer people than would indicate the size of this metropolis. And I must admit that the size of the virtual Los Angeles makes quite an impression when we launch the map available on the menu. The execution of city lacks nothing, but I would feel that it is really alive!\n\nSound design and music is definitely one of the strengths of this production. The soundtrack is filled with 26 songs inspired by the era in which the game takes place and it is not climatically, but simply phenomenal. Subtle jazz sounds in execution of trumpets, saxophones, percussion and string instruments is a mixture, which any movie of the higher shelf wouldn't be ashamed of. A more dynamic compositions also don't stick out on a step from the rest. Equally excellent are the voices of all the characters. This game is a feast for our ears.\n\nThe icing on the cake in L.A. Noire was supposed to be perfectly devoted facial expressions of the characters created by a special session of the motion-capture engulfing the faces of real actors and I must admit that it works very decently. Although facial expressions, if you can call it that way, are very stereotypical and relatively easy to recognize whether a person is calm or hiding something.\n\nSUMMARY (TL:DR)\nIn L.A. Noire players have received what they wanted most: climate, climate and climate once more. Detective sheath, an advanced facial expression betraying emotions of the characters, crime mysteries of the City of Angels, charismatic characters and music that simply melts in our ears compensate for slightly brutal simplification of the sections of arcade and a little disappointing visuals. Sincerely, this is one of my favorite titles.","January 21","true","25.7"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

It's capped at 30 FPS(ugh), meaning it's very choppy. It also has a lot of issues that were never fixed.It's a shame really because it's a nice looking game, but it was basically shovelwared to PC with no effort or respect for the platform. It's a lot like the Dark Souls PC port, which is also terrible. And like that game, it's highly rated. These games are TERRIBLE on PC, yet have glaring ratings. This is why you shouldn't trust Metacritic with console ports. Everyone is over rating these because the console version is good... that's nice and all... except that we're talking about the PC version here, in the PC section, and on Steam. You can also read plenty of reports about crashes or freezes(from people that have actually played it).\n\nIf you want this, get it on a console. Do not get it on PC. The PC version is absolutely terrible, and most of the reviews(even in the PC section of Metacritic) are praising it because of the console version, aka, idiots that'll probably never even try the version they are giving positive ratings to. Rockstar is another company that cares very little about the PC players, usually just shovelware porting their console games onto the platform. Btw, it also has Rockstar Studios attached to it, even on the Steam version.","September 7, 2014","false","3.9"," 38 of 58 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","38","58","0","0"

Cole soon realizes that the City of Angels has its share of demons, and that the Golden State has a much darker tone than advertised.\n\nEverything from Vice to Arson, Cole Phelps assumes the position of multiple police investigation desks following promotions and the like, and solves the cases given, not every time with the correct criminal put behind bars, with 4 desks in total. (Not counting Patrol)\n\nThe cases branch from stopping the morphine street trade, ending a corrupt Housing development's scheme, and even going after the an Argentine consulate for Pedophillia and corruption. Rather than focusing on gunning down everyone, Cole must use his wit to interrogate thugs and friends alike to get to the bottom of it all.\n\nThere are even short street missions that can occur during missions or in free roam, where Cole will end up putting his combat training to use against common street thugs.\n\nMy Complaint, is that it's a crappy console port, and runs really poorly; this is to be expected somewhat, as the characters are filmed with special facial technology that is filmed at 30 frames per second, running the game at a reasonable pace breaks the audio and characters entirely, so I can see why it's so poorly optimized.\n\nWhilst I was able to get it running by literally going for the lowest graphical settings, it's much better to buy this on a console if you have one, as for the time being, the PC version simply can't run faster than 30 frames and isn't the best optimized, and unless some major update fixes all this, the game will continue to have these problems.\n\nDo I recommend this title?

The graphics still look pretty decent for an older game and L.A. Noire has a fantastic atmosphere and a great soundtrack. Altough the game doesn't really have a main story, the individual cases are really interesting and well put together. Even if L.A. Noire is by no mean a free roaming game there are some fun side activity's to do. You can search the city for unlockable cars, view points(certain locations) and there are some side missions to do. The game also has some nice shootouts and chases!\n\nSadly, this game also has some downsides. The city of Los Angeles can feel a bit empty at times and the cases can feel a bit repetitive after a while. After finishing about 70% of L.A. Noire (DLC included) it just felt to repetitive and my interest in the game was lost. I think this is mainly because there is no real story, just some individual cases.\n\nAll together i would still highly recommend this game. It's truly an amazing expierence and well worth the money, Even if you don't finish it completely.","May 10","true","15.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","4"

L.A. Noire is more like a classical 'noir' movie rather than a computer game, and you get to play the star of the movie! The storyline centers a young, promising police officer -later detective- named Cole Phelps in 1940s Los Angeles. His tale has everything: crime, murder, trauma, love, politics, justice, conflict of interest and ethics... mostly conflict everywhere.\n\nThe atmosphere is magnificent, graphics are more than satisfying and story builds around many twists and turns, always keeping you wondering about what might come next. The investigation process is well displayed, heavily depending on observation, whether it be a mimic of a suspect, or a tone in the witness' voice. The environment is wast and it is possible to get lost if you're not following the map indicators. You carry the full option of roaming the streets of L.A. to hunt for all kinds of achievements, and even venture out to solve trivial street crimes. I once again agreed that Rockstar never abstains from investing in environment design.\n\nControls of the game is a bit hard to master in PC though, I think this game is better suited for PS or Xbox in that manner. Vehicles are impossibly hard to control - at least for me, but my reflexes were never that great so I'm not the one to have a final call on that -  and that would be the sole minus for me that I've observed so far. I found myself preferring my partner to drive rather than myself, and that's a bit disappointing. Oh, well: I'm not in for the perfection anyhow.\n\nI recommend it with CAPITAL CHARACTERS; for the story, graphics and display altogether.","February 13, 2015","true","49.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

If you've ever watched a Detective Noir movie like L.A Confidential then you pretty much know what to expect plot wise.\n\nThe adventure part of the gameplay will be familiar to anyone who's played adventure games in the early-mid 90's. You explore the crime scenes of your cases looking for items and clues that will help you in your investigation and then questioning the suspects of the case with the evidence that you have accumulated. The interviewing part is well done with some great voice acting and animation although the facial expressions can be a bit TOO subtle at times, you pretty much can't lose though as the story will still progress even if you get all the answers wrong.\n\nThe driving/shooting aspect is similar to any other open world game and you will be chasing and gunning down plenty of criminals during the 20-25 hour campaign. The theme and style of 1940's LA comes across really well with a brilliantly detailed city that has plenty of locations to explore, old fashioned cars to drive and a great albeit short period soundtrack.\nAnyone who is a fan of Noir movies and open world games with a mix of old school adventure will have a great time playing L.A Noire.\n","May 22, 2014","true","24.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

The skins of the characters are based on real actors (some of whom you'll be sure to recognize from TV and movies) and the facial espressions, mannerisms, and body language of the in-game characters is suberb!\nThe interrogation/questioning of suspects aspect of the game is, admittedly, a bit hard to learn, but once you get the hang of it it actually is one of the most interesting parts of the game.

Not that you can discern there is one at that point. In the last 1/3, the story does finally start going somewhere, picks up the pace and becomes enjoyable. A critical part of the game are interrogations, but deciding what evidence counts as enough to expose a lie vs doubting something, or what "truth" or "doubt" will actually cause your character to do say are anybodies guess. It always felt like a total crapshoot throughout the game. Never mind that it doesn't actually matter - somewhere during testing the game designers must've realized this and you can't actually fail even if you miss all the answers.\n\nThis isn't a bad game, but it isn't quite as good as the reviews made it out either.

In its entirety it’s intriguing and different.\nI like the detail put into it. In most games simple unimportant characters don’t really have a face of their own, they just use the same few models. (E.g. the citizens in Half-Life 2) but in this, every character has their own face and therefore their own identity, and I really liked that. They were all built around their voice actors and it was really amazing to see 3 or 4 actors that I knew of, appear in a video game. That was something that really did impress me.\n\nIt’s mainly a detective type game, and there is a lot more action to it than your average detective game. You get to drive around an open world city responding to street crime, be involved in car chases, find clues for your investigation and interrogate your subjects making sure you judge them right.\n\nI only have one problem with this game and that’s the storyline. It isn’t exactly a “game breaker” for me, I just found it a little disappointing. At first I was extremely intrigued with the plot and it felt like it was going to go somewhere great and be really good, but it just wasn’t. I found it very up and down, it leads up to one thing then completely changes the subject.\nAt the end of every mission you are given a score as to how well you did, and there are some points where you can’t avoid doing the wrong thing, which I thought was really stupid. There’s even one part you get told off for doing the right thing! I just thought that it was all over the place when it came to plotline.\n\nApart from that I think this game is great, it’s a lot of fun and it’s not something you see all that often.","September 9, 2012","true","25.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","3"

You're in for a rollercoaster that just gets faster and deeper the more you progress. In my opinion you should look at this game like you're participating actor in a very well done Noir series that could air on TV any day.\n\nFor a 2011 game it also still looks pretty great on full detail, the score and soundtrack is well done, suited to the era and atmosphere of the game. Cinematography feels like a movie too.\n\nA few tips for people who are diehard about the story though:\n- Take some time to see the town, you'd be surprised what you find.\n- Learn from your mistakes, don't use wikia unless absolutely necessary or if you want that 5star rating on your 2nd try.\n- It's an 18+ game for a reason, respect that while you play it. Some scenes really can be shocking for some people, so take it as a warning.\n\nAs conclusion (it's almost impossible to tell anything about this game without spoiling it), get it.

Noire quickly, it's the story of a LAPD cop named Cole Phelps and his rise & fall in the police system, all while questioning a bunch of people about various crimes. This game manages to immerse you into the past, in the late 40's as a LA police officer trying to climb the ladder.\n\nI like alot of things about this game: The ambience, the music, the facial system, the captivating storyline, the relevance of almost everything placed in the decor, the dialogue, etc, and the list goes on. Rockstar/Team Bondi (R.I.P.) have done an amazing job on this game, making sure to create a different feel than in their previous games (such as Bully or GTA). There is no other game like this one, and that's a quality I love when it comes to good games.\n\nThe story will run you at the very minimum at least 26 hours (DLC included) and you can then retry past cases individually to try and get better. I like to play through L.A. Noire about once every 1/1,5 years (it's kinda like a movie, where it's as enjoyable as the first time once you let some time pass and come back to it).\n\nI would recommend getting the complete edition of this game to any fan of Noire TV series or movies, and fans of well scripted detective games. DO NOT come into L.A. Noire expecting exactly the same as GTA but as a cop in the 40's because you will be very dissapointed.

My alibi clears me!"\nYou: "You're lying! You're the culprit!"\nGabe: "prove it!"\nYou: you bring up Half Life 3... "Why isn't this out yet?!"\nGabe: "Oh! You got me!" *correct answer*\n\nOverall, it's a good game with multiple interesting stories of crime. I completely recommend it if you're interested in solving crimes by finding clues and detecting people are lying.","May 18","true","25.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

No drive-and-shoot (Your a detective with common sense.

( I wont say much about it because I dont intent to spoiler).\n\nThe Missions are very well developed. You have to question suspects and pay attention for example in which order you ask questions or which evidences you provide. You have to check if you can dig up more evidence by visiting different people or points of interest, find information on places murderes happend or find information in letters, written orders or other types of papers. You often question people and either decide if they lie, tell the trueth or seem suspicious which you can tell by their facial expressions. (If they hide something they will often try to avoid looking at your or into your face and search the room with their eyes).\n\nThere are shootings happening frequently. The side missions are often based on catching someone escaping from a crime scene or even shooting down all oponents. You can use their guns. Aiming and taking cover is similiar to  GTAV.\nSo action is present in the game as too and balances it very well.\n\nIt is very fun even if you fail in most cases you still will move on with the story but get less points by setting up wrong evidence or accuse them of a lie while they spoke the trueth to you. There arent many games that combine those features with an open world and an interesting story.\n\nThe open world is interesting too since all the cars and environments are set in the last century. Do not expect a GTA V of course, The game is made in 2011 and the traffic AI is horrible in fact you can try to drive perfectly and the AI will simply ram you off if they want to switch the lanes.\nThe environment is set in LA only and you cannot really leave the city. You can visit some real life landmarks, especially the train station is very nice as you can see incomming and leaving trains but sadly its also a bit glitched.\nThere are no different radio stations which is a bit of a downer too. The city is very alive and you in fact are able to look into the different shops and even enter many houses and buildings.\nThe pedestrians however act funny too. You should avoid to run them over since you are a cop you get a message you shall protect civillians and not bring them into danger. In fact you even can lose points if you do continue bad behavior.\n\nAnother thing I personally dislike is the social club login. You always have to keep signing in but in LA Noire it simply wont save my account data and I regularyly have to retype it to be able to start the game.\n\nI payed 5 Euroes and 99 cents but the game was completely worth it. I enjoy it a lot and since you can handle the missions very differently, there is quite some replay value as well if you wanna keep puzzling on a perfect score.","February 5","true","24.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

They used a technology where they basically filmed the actors face and put it into the game. No animations, no face capture, you see real people there. That is the main selling point - at least for me - of the game because no other game used this since then. It is very expensive, that is why.\n- REAL(istic) movements. The motion capture worked really well, I rarely see this detailed animations.\n- Interesting cases. They're small full stories in themselves, but most of them somehow connects to the bigger picture. You start the game as a patrol, then as you move forward you became a detective. You solve cases at each different desk, but you only start to get the picture after half of the game.\n- Good main story. It is beliveable, the characters are detailed, such as their motivations. The plot twist impressed me.\n- I'd say nice cars as well, but that isn't a big thing to do these days.\n\nContra:\n- Repetitive investigating. You use the same techniques and scripted animations over and over.\n- Also repetitive street crimes. Car chases, thefts and shootings. These were the three main types. Some were interesting though.\n- Annoying sound bugs. Had to restart the last mission from the beginning because couldn't heard sh*t from the last cutscene.\n- 30 FPS lock. And it drops below 24 even on a strong config.\n\nThis is a smart game. The developers outdone themselves with the whole facial expression and mocap feature, but they didn't put as much emphasis on important things as they should have. My 27 hours playtime felt like 40 because I got bored many times during it. Still can't dislike it, if it's on sale go and buy it.\n\n7/10","June 22, 2015","true","25.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I was told this was a puzzle game with some movie-like noir elements.\n\nThat was wrong. L.A. Noire is a boredom factory. You push some buttons, you look around, you click through some dialogue and out comes the snores. The game is simple, the action sequences are usually holding the shift button as you jump over fences and short walls and other manners of game props while chasing a bad guy, and the 'puzzle' elements involve looking for one of the many shiny clue objects in a scene (there isn't even any clutter to complicate things, the console effect means that even in supposedly hectic scenes like a recently trashed apartment there are only a few interact-able props, which the main character will almost immediately tell you “isn't relevant to the investigation”) or walking around a room until a piano note sounds, then pressing a button and rotating an object to get the ♥♥♥♥♥ detective to look at all 4 sides of a knife before deciding it could be a murder weapon.\n\nNo matter what you choose from the dialogue branches, the main character shoots off in whatever direction he fancies, so any immersion into the supposed movie atmosphere of the game is broken every time it prompts you for input because the talking heads have no flow to their discussion.\n\n“Stick with it”, they cry, “the later cases get pretty good!”\n\nHogwash. It felt like a chore slogging through every single mission, at no point was I having fun. The stories aren't compelling, the gameplay isn't exciting, the puzzles aren't puzzles, and above all the voice acted dialogue sequences are an agony to sit through (not because of the voice acting, which is average at its worst). Pass, pass ten thousand times. I would rather play a real puzzle game, a visual novel, or an action game. L.A. Noire tries to do some mashup of all three and comes out a pile of turds. I think somebody accidentally released a facial emotion tech demo.","May 17, 2014","false","3.1"," 76 of 141 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","76","141","0","0"

Noire is a real gem of my game library! It has everything I've ever wished for in detective games:\n\n* Open world with 95 vehicles you can drive. There is an Auto Fanatic achievement for starting engine of all vehicles available in the game at least once. Searching for more cars in game made me look at cars parked along sidewalks irl and think if they are those which are missing ;)\n* Wide variety of cases to solve under different departments of the police institute. It successfully prevents the game from being too repetitive and you get new partners to work on cases with.\n* Action! You will chase criminals and suspects on foot or in a vehicle. Combat involves both fist and gun fighting depends on a situation. But you must fight appropriately back or your mission will fail and you will have to start over. Weapons can only be used during firefights. If you can't successfully finish an action mission, the game will offer you to simply skip it and move on after the 3rd try. I think that's a great deal for people who are more interested in the story than in the challenges.\n* Many dialogues, questioning, truth, doubt and lie choices, great face mimic.\n* Nice graphics, attention to the detail, great voice acting.\n* You get to play character who's personality you learn more about through his behaviour, conversations and flashbacks of his past. You will find out he is a person who makes mistakes and who sure has skeletons in his closet.. It's pretty amazing how complex his personality is. I really like the twists we are getting there.\n\nI must say, don't let the 30 fps cap scare you away from one of the greatest detective games. You can easily fix it and increase it to 60.\n\nL.A. Noire is definitely worth of being finished. Towards the ending the game includes the most action scenes. Before that I used to play it when I wanted to relax after a hard day at work. Then things escalated and the story got a fast speed untill it reached the typical noire fiction ending.\n\nI really recommend the game from the bottom of my heart.

I‘m a fan of adventure games and i loved it. Of course the game is not perfect.\nI was amazed by the graphics when it came out on PS3 and purchased it. Now i bought it with all the DLC. Rockstar know how to make DLC, this is real DLC which adds about 8-9 hours of gameplay and the quality of DLC cases is great. It‘s integrated into the story cases and you can‘t even tell whether you‘re playing DLC or not.\nThe facial animations still surprises me, i so want more games with similar technology. Wouldn‘t it be nice to se a walking dead game with such animations?\nThe overall graphics is pretty good too. But the performance is not the strongest part of this game. The game is pretty old and the framerate is not very good. Of course i used the fix which unlocks 60fps it made the game better.\nSolving cases is fun, you search for the clues and talk to the witnesses and suspects and must decide if they‘re lying or not. The cases are different so it never gets boring. Story is very interesting too.\nIt‘s an open world game but i really don‘t understand what’s the point of it. You have nothing to do except for story and side missions.

One minute you will be looking for clues, the next minute you will be questioning suspects/witnesses, and five minutes later you might find yourself in a shootout, fist brawl, stakeout, foot chase, or car chase. While things might not progress in that particular order, the point is that you will find yourself doing all of these things throughout the course of the game, or even within the same case. The game starts to feel like many games combined into one, but the transition is seemless. This game is a must buy for those that want something different and wouldn't mind role-playing as a cop.

Noire, why are you so entertaining and so disappointing at the same time?\n\nL.A. Noire is mostly the story of Cole Phelps, a former-marine-now-policeman working in the Angels' city. As such, he will have to work his way up the food chain, starting in patrol, soon to be promoted to trafic, homicide and what not.\n\nThe game is a mix and match of several genres: it's a bit of a point n' click, but with third-person shooting and driving around, in a beautifully recreated L.A. Mostly, you'll be collecting clues on crime scenes, and interviewing suspects, while a partner lets you do all the work and comments on your action.\n\nThose parts are great. Thanks to some fancy facial-capture technology and the help of professional actors, the characters of L.A. Noire feel alive, and real. You can see their expression on their faces, notice when they tell the truth or when they lie (in which case you gotta shove a clue you collected into their face). Coles Phelps yells, gets mad, doubts... In a very convincing way. The cast includes many well-know series actors, from Madmen, Breaking Bad or Twin Peaks.\nWhat's more, the shooting parts (relatively frequent) aren't that bad, for an investigation game.\n\nBut L.A. Noire's greatest success is its wonderful film noire atmosphere. Secret loves, murders, illegal gamblings, corrupted politicians and cops, jazz, femmes fatales... Everything is right here, in a post-WW2 US. A country that feels invincible, but whose confidence hides nasty stories.\n\nGreat, heh?\n\nYeah, except that L.A. Noire also disappoints. If you don't stick to the cases you're supposed to be solving, you quickly find out its greatest weakness: Los Angeles has no soul. The city is beautiful, mind you. But nothing happens. Car drives around, people walk. There are a few scripted events. But that's about it. You can't drive around and tail someone just because he looks weird. The game has to tell you to do it. You can't get into a restaurant a get yourself a coffee and read the news. You can't discuss with people. The city feels like a beautiful, but empty playground.\n\nIf you're expecting a game that looks and plays like Gran Theft Auto, let's say you might be turned off by L.A. Noire. The game has little in common with Rockstar' behemoth. But if you like the film noire genre, and are willing to put up with sometimes clunky or repetitive gameplay, then you ought to try L.A. Noire. I personnally see the game as an interactive story (a bit like The Walking Dead), taking place in an open world where you can drive fancy old cars.

Noire, why are you so entertaining and so disappointing at the same time?\n\nL.A. Noire is mostly the story of Cole Phelps, a former-marine-now-policeman working in the Angels' city. As such, he will have to work his way up the food chain, starting in patrol, soon to be promoted to trafic, homicide and what not.\n\nThe game is a mix and match of several genres: it's a bit of a point n' click, but with third-person shooting and driving around, in a beautifully recreated L.A. Mostly, you'll be collecting clues on crime scenes, and interviewing suspects, while a partner lets you do all the work and comments on your action.\n\nThose parts are great. Thanks to some fancy facial-capture technology and the help of professional actors, the characters of L.A. Noire feel alive, and real. You can see their expression on their faces, notice when they tell the truth or when they lie (in which case you gotta shove a clue you collected into their face). Coles Phelps yells, gets mad, doubts... In a very convincing way. The cast includes many well-know series actors, from Madmen, Breaking Bad or Twin Peaks.\nWhat's more, the shooting parts (relatively frequent) aren't that bad, for an investigation game.\n\nBut L.A. Noire's greatest success is its wonderful film noire atmosphere. Secret loves, murders, illegal gamblings, corrupted politicians and cops, jazz, femmes fatales... Everything is right here, in a post-WW2 US. A country that feels invincible, but whose confidence hides nasty stories.\n\nGreat, heh?\n\nYeah, except that L.A. Noire also disappoints. If you don't stick to the cases you're supposed to be solving, you quickly find out its greatest weakness: Los Angeles has no soul. The city is beautiful, mind you. But nothing happens. Car drives around, people walk. There are a few scripted events. But that's about it. You can't drive around and tail someone just because he looks weird. The game has to tell you to do it. You can't get into a restaurant a get yourself a coffee and read the news. You can't discuss with people. The city feels like a beautiful, but empty playground.\n\nIf you're expecting a game that looks and plays like Gran Theft Auto, let's say you might be turned off by L.A. Noire. The game has little in common with Rockstar' behemoth. But if you like the film noire genre, and are willing to put up with sometimes clunky or repetitive gameplay, then you ought to try L.A. Noire. I personnally see the game as an interactive story (a bit like The Walking Dead), taking place in an open world where you can drive fancy old cars. Too bad the game could have been so much more.","March 23, 2014","true","42.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Tasks such as running and gunning while goons are unloading whole mags on you feels a bit unresponsive at times, and I've had some minor graphical glitches dealing with character's heads at times.

Noire is a such a unique adventure game that borrows many features from mystery and action games, incorporating them seamlessly in the narrative flow, creating a truly special game.\nThere's a wide array of vehicles and cases to solve under different departments, suspects to chase, either on foot or while driving and suspects in custody to interrogate.\nThe graphics are amazing, the gameplay is pretty good, the soundtrack and voice acting are marvelous but what really makes this game a masterpiece is the astonishing and engaging story and the character development.\nI highly recommend L.A.

Okay, wait, let's get the bad out of the way first.\n\n1) It's optimized poorly. The game seemingly started fine, or perhaps I was too enamored with the city to notice, but DX9 or DX11, highest settings or lowest, nothing mattered. The camera would stutter, the engine would slow, and otherwise damage the otherwise breathtaking aesthetics of L.A. Noire.\n\n2) The driver and pedestrian A.I. is atrocious. For a game that forces you to spend the majority of your time driving, expect to laugh at the ridiculous decisions made by the NPCs in this game. Then, when chasing down suspects or trying to avoid... well, I won't spoil anything, but let's just say at certain points, you will yell at the television for these dummies to get out of the way.\n\n3) The action sequences aren't as interesting as the investigation ones. Basic action, such as the street crimes, or even a moderate shootout, aren't too bad but the above complaints tend to ruin any tension Team Bondi attempted to create.\n\nI think that's about it. So what did I like?\n\n1) The city. Sorry, Sleeping Dogs, you've been knocked off the top spot (previously owned by Saints Row 2) for best video game city. It's no wonder Team Bondi went bankrupt after this game. The amount of time and resources it must have taken to recreate Los Angeles is staggering.\n\n2) The characters. Thanks to stellar voice acting and the well-publicized facial animation engine, it's easy to forget you're playing a game and not watching a movie. Tip: Play L.A. Noire in black and white and the effect is even more staggering.\n\n3) The story. I'm a sucker for noir in general, and this is a pretty good tribute to the genre. That pretty much every single element is tied to the main story, no matter how minor it seems, is a nice touch.\n\n4) The investigation. Whether you're screaming at a widower -- er, I mean 'doubting' a widower -- or trying to figure out how a torn letter fits with the case, I enjoyed poking around the city's seedy underbelly and solving the (many!) mysteries.\n\nNote that I keep writing "the city" instead of "the game." Yes, it's that realistic.\n\nI loved L.A. Noire, and if you like mysteries and history at all, please don't hesitate picking up this game. Just be warned that even at 30 FPS, a computer that laughs at the recommended specs of the latest games will (probably) not run this smoothly. Fortunately, you'll probably be too engrossed to care.

The major issue is you have to read facial cues from people- and while it's easy enough to tell when someone is being honest, for some reason lies are split up into "doubt" and "lie" - which is ridiculous, and you usually act more hostile when you "doubt" than when you're sure it's a "lie". As a result you get all those questions wrong, which forces you to re-do some cases. So you go online for the solutions, which really just ruins the game.\n\nThe city is fantastic, the characters are well-written, and the missions a fantastic progression.

How many video games have a jazz soundtrack?\n- You can play the game in "black and white" (and it looks gorgeous this way).\n- The writing is better neo-noire than most films have ever managed.\n- The city of 1947 LA was directly modeled from aerial photographs.\n- THE CARS OMG THE CARS!!!!!\n- When you interview people, their facial movements reveal if they're lying.\n- This is based on real science, so playing this game will improve your lie detector skills irl.\n\nLA Noire is a masterpiece.  It isn't as wildly popular as it deserves to be because it focuses more on style and detail than on NONSTOPACTIONPEWPEWPEW.

Noire, just like Rockstar’s later titles, is a controversial game. On one hand, it was advertised as some realistic detective simulator and crime drama, which is a blatant lie. On the other hand, it provides a clichéd, yet well-crafted story, some decent acting and quite a few enjoyable individual cases. Just don’t go besides the main plot: none of the side content is worth it in any way.\n\nLong version:Although L. A. noire was initially marketed as a detective simulator, don’t fall for that: it’s about as realistic as any Hollywood blockbuster. All of the clues are in the open, almost all of the cases involve shooting and killing somebody (the story mode’s bodycount is higher than GTAIII’s), and your average everyday cop will be involved in cases that feature a Jack the Ripper style serial murder, city-wide political conspiracies, international espionage (where you’ll have to massacre a US Military compound all by yourself) and drug trafficking that would put the Columbian Cartel to shame.\nAdd in some very sluggish controls, the most boring and frustrating collection minigame and side missions that are literally all the same, and you may think that anyone who gave positive reviews about the title were paid large sums of money.\n\nSo why the thumbs up? Because of the story. It’s quite decently acted– the biggest weak point is Aaron Staton’s performance as the protagonist, who just looks and sounds perpetually annoyed– and even though the plot is as clichéd as you can imagine, it uses these clichés to their best. Sure, this will eliminate most of the surprise at the plot twists, but they aren’t even set up as something to be surprised of.\nPlus some of the individual cases– especially for the Traffic and Arson desks– are pretty damn interesting. They are well-written crime stories, worthy to be an episode of a classic police drama. Sure, the overall plot pales in comparison, but some of the cases are so good you may want to play them again, separate from the main story.\n\nSo, in conclusion, L. A. Noire is the kind of title which you should play from start to the end once, and never again. Luckily, the main story is more than 12 hours long even if you use a guide to get past the clue-collecting phases, so you get decent amount of entertainment for your money.","August 15, 2014","true","82.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The story line and voice acting is very good and quite absorbing. I've never been a big fan of crime detective adventure mysteries but this game has changed all that...I'm hooked, at least for L.A. Noire. The keyboard (you can customize) and mouse controls take a bit of practice but then it flows quite well.\nThe downside (which is very insignificant) is the auto saves, I'm not a fan of that but in a game like this that is probably the only option.\nI highly recommend this game, just be sure you have a computer that can handle it...I too give it a 9 out of 10!\n\nPatrick\n","June 16, 2014","true","25.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

The game has a wondeful ambiance, a great score, and very strong characters.\n\nWhy not a better score than 7/10?  Three things cost it those three points for me:\n\n1) The "GTA"-like elements feel out of place/unnecessary.  The game is 80% criminal investigation, 20% action (car-chases/shoot-outs/fist-fights).  The action bits feel "tacked-on" and are not fleshed out very well in comparison to the rest of the game.  Driving between locations feels largely pointless with very little to do between points-of-interest.\n\n2) The interrogation/questioning aspect can come off as a little strange at times. You might know that a suspect is lying, but it isn't always clear if you've got the correct piece of evidence to directly accuse them of lying. When you make a bad choice, you look like an idiot, but it doesn't change the outcome of the case for the most part. The story moves forward even if you bungle all the questioning/interrogating/evidence gathering parts.\n\n3) The ending sucks. It's abrupt and leaves a lot of loose ends. It feels like they ran out of time. I know that's my opinion, but I'm sure many other people feel the same.","June 12, 2015","true","34.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It has to do with the movie industry, political corruption, war, corrupt cops, psychiatry, drugs, land speculation, cars, guns and the American dream…\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD: The protagonist is a “hero” that makes so grave mistakes that he does not deserve to be called that. In the end, that’s exactly why the man calling him a hero is a big liar.\n\nJack Kelso, the man you learn to despise, ends up being the man with more character. This is a unpredictable twist, which almost saves the story. It still has some visible flaws. Still, I found it worth to play due to its interesting (but somehow flawed) investigation mechanic.\n\n","May 24, 2014","true","43.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a mystery adventure with open world elements and a bit of gunplay. If you're into crime thrillers and things of that nature then chances are you'll like the narrative as much as I do. It's really the best part of the game other than the mo-cap animations. The biggest flaw in the game is the logic you will have to follow in order to perfectly complete each case. Some trains of thought are simple to understand, some will leave you lost. Related to that is the system where you have to interview people of interest and determine if they're honest, lying or just leaving out some details. If you're unfamiliar with body habits in regards to lying (rockstar has the insight to base it on real science lol), it might be hard to get the right answer. But it's a good game and you'll get maybe 20-30 hours out of a playthrough depending if you get the complete edition. That comes with a handful of DLC cases, and most of them are pretty interesting and offer a way to flesh out certain characters more.","June 11, 2014","true","85.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphcs are good in terms of setting a balance of immersion by creating a very realistic vibe. The street crime cases add a bit of flavor to the overall gameplay to a game that may seem too linear to some by providing a bit of uncertainty for when the next case will come. The main cases are very interesting and carry a lot of suspense and intrigue. The downside of many of these cases is that they may become too easy for some and may not prove to be a good challenge. However, it is important to note that only the chase scenes can be a bit too easy, but actually finding the clues and persons of interests in the right order can prove to be a challenge. The controls are the typical WASD and a realistic point and shoot dynamic without any visible crosshairs. Overall, I found it a very pleasing game to play and there is a certain uniqueness that creates an enticing desire to continue to the next case.","January 13, 2015","true","31.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game combines all my interests into one package.  It is fascinating to just drive around and look at things (clothes, cars, shops, etc...) and see how they were in 1947.  The gameplay is also well done too, you basically wander around in L.A. and try to solve crimes by looking for clues and talking to people.  The lip-synching is fantastic, L.A. Noire could almost pass for an animated movie.  When questioning witnesses, you have to really look at their faces to see if they are lying or telling partial truths, it takes some practice but you'll get good at it with just a little time.  Think of this game as a time machine back to the late 1940's, it lets you experience the time period in a way that you could never do by just reading books or watching movies.  I was a little worried about the performance issues I'd read about but the game runs absolutely fine on my old dual core PC (with a few small additions in the launch options).  I highly recommend this game to anyone who is on the fence about it... get it now and start playing, you won't regret it.","December 13, 2013","true","5.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a word you hear a lot when descriibing TV cop dramas. Despite how exciting those shows can be, the word itself sounds like something incredibly boring. Probably in real life it most often is. Great music and montages can do a lot to make a detective's life look enviable. The problem with LA Noire is that there are no montages. There's this huge world to explore, yet there's no reason or pull to. Each chapter, or 'case' is so short and contained that it never feels like the right time to go exploring. Why then make the game appear so much like a sandbox? Being 'on mission' all the time, having such a focus on realism, being rated constantly: it all amounts to nurturing a fear of experimenting and going off track. Yet these are the things which evoke fun times.

Instead of playing as a dangerous criminal, you play as the good guy who is trying to solve crimes.\nThis game takes place in 1940s LA. Rockstar managed to recreate the world well and it provides a unique atmosphere to the game. There's not going to be too many instances where you go around killing people with your gun, because this is supposed to be an investigation game, rather than a open world city sandbox game. The plot can be unpredictable, and keeps the player interested to continue the game. Graphics are quite nice, and the DLCs are also worth trying.\nHowever, the PC version is by flawed, too.

I love the setting of the 1940's and especially the noir and detective aspects.  This game is the closest you will get to playing L.A. Confidential: The Video Game.  I found the story and even the individual cases to be very engrossing and they feel like actual crimes that could have been committed.  I love a video game with a great story above all else and this one totally delivers on that.  All of the characters feel very real and have more depth than in other Rockstar games.  Cole Phelps, the protagonist, at first seems like a squeaky clean detective, but as the story goes on, that changes and you become very engrossed in him as a character.  When you add a deep and perplexing murder myster to that, I was hooked.  There are even real historical characters (gangsters like Bugsy Siegel) in the game and scientology makes an appearance (in an interesting way) too.\n\nGameplay - You assume the role of Detective Cole Phelps and investigate crimes, interrogate suspects, tail suspects, and sometimes get in shoot outs and fist fights.  I really like the way L.A. Noire handles investigations.  You have to find clues at the crime scenes by picking up and examining objects.  When you find suspects, you can interview them and respond in three ways (truth, doubt, or lying) depending on what they say.  This is probably the most challenging part of the game because unless you're very good, it can be hard to know whether to doubt or call the suspect a liar.  You can and will arrest the wrong person if you get too many questions wrong or don't find all the evidence.  Fortunately, there are plenty of guides out there to help you if you are worried about getting it wrong.  In total, the game has somewhere between 20-30 cases and it took me around 30 hours to get through them all.  I never got tired of playing L.A. Noire and would have played many more cases if I could.\n\nA lot of the other game play is really similar to Grand Theft Auto.  Driving is arcadey in a good way and shooting is cover based and pretty fun too.  While you spend more time investigating in missions than doing shooting and car chases, the game also offers street crimes which are often foot or car chases with a shoot out or a fist fight thrown in.  These aren't necessary to beat the game but they are fun and were a nice addition.\n\nPresentation (Graphics and Sound) - The graphics in L.A. Noire are both dated and incredibly impressive at the same time.  I'm pretty sure this game uses a version of the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine and while the graphics are solid, they do look like a PS3 game and if you have a good gaming pc, you can certainly find games that look better.  What makes this game great though is the acting and animation of the characters.  L.A. Noire uses a newer animation system that captured the way the voice actors looked and acted when delivering the lines.  This makes it possible to see when someone is lying and it also makes the characters look really distinct and believable.  I hope we'll see more games use this technology in the future.  In addition, the makers of this game put an incredible amount of detail into replicating the Los Angeles of the 1940's.  The city looks and feels real.  There is so much detail and nothing feels recycled when you drive around.\n\nThe sound is excellent from the voice acting to the authentic music on your car radio when you drive around.  I love the theme song for this game and think it sets the mood for the game better than almost any other I've seen.\n\nOverall - As I said at the beginning, I truly love this game.  From the story to the realism to the satisfying game play, I think L.A. Noire has it all.  If you don't care about these things, especially a great story then it is very possible you will like this game a lot less than I do or lose interest in it before beating it.  I've certainly heard people say that they felt this way and I think this is just one of those games that some people will really love and others will just find to be pretty good.  However, if my review sounds appealing to you, this game is one of Rockstar's best and that is really saying something.\n\nAs far as achievements go, this game is very easy to get a high percentage on by playing through the game once and trying to grab achievements as you go.  You will want to find a good guide for getting five stars on every case and for making sure to use all the weapons in the game or you will have to repeat parts of the game.  The one that kept me from trying to get them all is an achievement that makes you drive every car in the game.  There isn't an easy to find all of these cars and you almost need some luck to get them all.  That one is a bit of a bummer but I would still say that compared to other games, L.A. Noire has more reasonable achievements, especially if you can live with getting 90% or so of them.\n\n9.5 (out of 10)","March 2, 2014","true","42.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is one of its own kind i can't imagine how could it be any better. You can choose to take hints or play it Old School. The character movement and interaction is flawless too. The best part for me was interviewing people you never actually get bored because you always need to make sure that you ask the right questions after getting enough clues, you might miss a clue and that would be it. Now the plot is even better as when the game begins there are just usual cases, but then there are those missions which will make you think if everything is connected or not. The worst part was when the game ended because although it's an open world game but once the story ends you don't have much to do unfortunately.

Bad, this was made for the consoler first, and then the team got lazy on importing it to PC version so they just took the exact copy of the X360 and PS3 versions and put it in the PC version = 30FPS lock, and it looks f*cking bad! It can be removed with a program but that does not completely fix it, instead makes it worse in some cases i.ex when driving a vehicle, the physics becomes very bad and you can not steer the vehicle almost at all, but I recommend you to turn it off while driving and just trying to survive that 30FPS maddnes, it's just a game afterall I guess...\n\nAltho' some of it's negative feedback I gave this game, I can easilly give this game a 8.5/10 rating!","January 7","true","36.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Firstly graphics are from 2011 but are really good for its time. The way you have to look at the persons face to tell if they are lying is amazing and also difficult at times, but its do-able. The music of this game is really well made if you are a jazz fan like myself. This game has a very interesting and captivating story which keeps you playing it. The dlc is worth getting as it adds more missions to the game and keeps you playing it longer, therefore the complete edition is worth the price.

As I don't want to provide spoilers, I'll try to be brief. At first I thought that the crime or chapters of the homicide cases were poorly written because although some of the clues pointed out to the "person of interest" being the criminal, even though not everything fit into place. After playing through the chapters a few more times, I thought maybe it was just the developer's way of portraying the LAPD in the 1940's and their focus on convicting a suspect instead of actually finding out who did it and delivering justice; justice however is relative to the person dishing it out and the person receiving it. It could also be that all the cases lead up to a true mastermind framing everybody else, so that is something to look forward to. Overall, the gameplay is pretty enjoyable in the sense that it is quite similar to GTA. So if you're a GTA or mystery fan, and you are also interested in playing the role of the cop instead of the role of a robber, I would highly recommend this.","January 16","true","18.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The cinematics and writing is  top-notch hollywood level stuff. The graphics; for it's age, the facial/emotional detail is astounding.\n\nTaking a break from ratchet ganster adventures, LA Noire puts you in the shoes of the "good guys". The police that chased you when you obtained stars from rachet gangster activities. The new perspective is fresh, and picks your brain in the best ways (if you enjoy those types of games that is). The beginning maybe feel slow for some, but if you accept the setting the developers has produced, then you are in for one hell of a ride.\n\nDownsides: While going through a full playthrough is possible, the port is still buggy with numerous problems.

The open world is rendered beautifully in 1940s L.A. with incredibly detailed landmarks and plenty of interiors you can just walk straight into and explore even with no incentive given to do so.\n\nWhat it does good though, it fails a largely in repetitiveness and a rather disconnected story that mostly just consists of a bunch of cases that always ends up with you arresting the culprit, guilty or not, it doesnt even matter. The same game elements like investigations and interrogations that looked interesting at first eventually starts getting stale and might become quite a chore to do, with so little in the way of variation.\nTrying to ace interviews and interrogation scenes are not the least easy and sometimes the correct answers (Lie, Doubt, Truth) doesn't make sense. I started this game mostly looking forward to a good detective noir story but what turned out instead is quite a disappointment. The central plot only gets underway in the final desk of the game making everything you did before nothing more than random crime cases. Story overall is nothing impressive and even seemed quite rushed. Mediocre at best.\nLook past the flaws however, and the game still holds up with brilliant dialogue and voice acting and exceling in innovation in its own rights.","June 6, 2014","true","48.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dylanai/recommended/110800/","dylanai","Luminaire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dylanai/","500 products in account","I'd forgotten how much of an immersive and distinctive storytelling experience L.A. Noire is in the four years since I completed it on the Xbox 360. It's essentially a hardboiled detective novel brought to life in a highly cinematic gaming experience. I just picked up the complete edition on sale for dirt cheap, and before I knew it, I was spellbound and had spent the entire evening playing it for several hours straight in a single sitting. As the minutes turned into hours, I found myself once again drawn into the game's shadowy world of vice, corruption, and murder that brilliantly captures the atmosphere of 1950s Los Angeles in a medium it had never been explored. The narrative revolves around one main character and a few minor ones and slowly (some would say tediously; this is not a typical open world sandbox game, so don't approach it like one...it requires patience and an open mind) progresses through a series of cases in which you repeat many of the same gameplay elements (inspect crime scenes for clues, go to new locations they lead you to, track down and interrogate suspects, and rinse & repeat in various orders with some chase & gunfight sequences thrown in for pacing as well as optional dispatch missions you can take on in the middle of a case), but the writing, variety of rich settings, and overall presentation are top notch and keep the formula fresh and the mysteries (both in individual missions and the overarching story) tantalizing regardless of linearity. The graphics have aged a bit (even running on maximum settings, pop-in is more evident, draw distance is shorter, and environmental textures that comprise foliage & buildings are much less detailed than the current standards), but none of that detracts from the experience or the dense, vibrant world and performances that made this game so great back in 2011. In fact, the motion capture technology it employed was far ahead of its time, allowing it to showcase nuanced facial expressions that weren't matched by other videogames until only around a year ago. This PC port is outstanding, running at a high, stable frame rate and improving on an already visually compelling console game.\n\nIf you haven't played this yet, I highly recommend it, especially since you can now get the complete package for around $5 which includes the original four standalone DLC missions and two previously console-exclusive missions that are inserted into the campaign, making this akin to a director's cut. A modern classic and smart, savvy game with dark themes for mature audiences.","March 31","true","20.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I do like this period a lot, and the look of the game (if you like, you can play this in b/w as well), the music/radio broadcasts (unfortunately, no way to switch radio stations manually, apparently. No custom music either, but then again, listening to modern music in the car would kinda ruin the immersion), the cars, fashion, lingo etc... just GREAT.\nAlso, since this is based on old thrillers and stories by guys like Raymond Chandler, they went for that vibe, and did it VERY well... this does feel a lot like a that noire crime fiction Chandler was famous for.\n\n- The general idea is very cool and, IMO, refreshing - interrogating people and, based on the clues you found and their facial expressions (done with actors and motion capture) figuring out whether they're lying or not... great job there! The IGN review says that sometimes, it is too easy to tell when someone is telling a lie or getting nervous - but doesn't that add even more realism? After all, not everyone is a good liar irl!\n\n- The gameplay. The cars DO feel a bit... odd, chases can get a tiny bit frustrating, the shooting mechanics are far from perfect, but between examining crime scenes, searching for clues, interrogating witnesses and suspects, using your notebook to find clues, car chases, shootouts and some interludes to deepen the story, there is some variety.\n\n- The characters. I really like the main protagonist, and some of his fellow policemen. Sure, there is quite a bit of clichè to be found here, but that again fits well, as this is a tribute to the noire-genre, which never was deep literature anyway.\n\nNow for the less than positive or even negative parts:\n\n- On rails. To a certain degree, the game takes away your freedom. An example: In one case, I apparently missed a clue at one of the places I visited. I was doing interrogations at the police station, and was not able to go back to those places and pick up the thing I missed, which would have made solving the case easier and unlocked some additional questions/accusations.\n\n- Evidence. Basically, if you think a person is not telling the truth, you wanna choose "doubt". If you pick "lie", you have to prove the person is a liar with a piece of evidence/clue from your notebook. And sometimes that doesn't work right. Not a bug, it's the writing. The abbreviated details of the clue or piece of evidence might make you think that it is clear evidence the guy is a liar, but when you choose it, the game says it's wrong or not enough.\n\n- Some frame rate issues. This game is by no means recent. I don't have a killer gaming pc (i7, 16 gigs of ram, Nvidia GTX 960 with 4 GB of ram), but I would think that it should be able to run this game well... and still, there are frame rate issues, the game sometimes slows down. Odd, when games like Unity, Mad Max, GTA V, Witcher III or even Arkham Knight perform much better on my system. YMMV.\n\n- Repetition. Sometimes, the cases are TOO alike, or at least the procedure you do is. There is a bigger storyline with a certain series of murders, and at one point, it was like "OK, another murder like those other ones. Check for clues. Interrogate. Visit a bar. Visit another place. Interrogate. Done". Of course, those steps should be part of it in a crime/police-game, but I think there should have been more variety in the cases or the activities that are involved in them.\nI did enjoy the homicide cases (after the first or second promotion), but didn't enjoy the drug-related cases I was given after my next promotion\n\n- Mechanics. As I said, driving feels...wonky. Mind you, you are not driving a very recent sports car or something like that, but the controls feel a bit clunky sometimes, and so do the physics. I did play the game with an Xbox controller.\n\n\nVerdict: The idea was refreshing, and they really nailed it with the setting and vibe. Unfortunately, there are flaws to the whole Lie/truth/doubt/clues/notebook-system. Sometimes it's misleading, not elaborate enough, and sometimes it's too much "on rails".\nHowever, the story, vibe and the idea itself are great, and even though it's not perfect, I'd give this a 7.5/10. I got this while it was on sale and do not regret it at all, I do enjoy the game. Check out some gameplay videos maybe, and if you can get it on sale and dig crime/police-games and the era this is set in, check it out!","January 11","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

FOR FOV, USE FLAWLESS WIDESCREEN AND PRESS EITHER + OR - TO CHANGE THE VIEW. THE PORT FOR THIS GAME ISN'T REALLY THAT GOOD BUT THE GAME ITSELF IS.\n\nLA Noire is an open world detective game set in the 1940s after WWII. You play as a Cole Phelps, a marine turned police officer then detective. You solve cases from traffic to homicide to vice and then arson.\n\nPORT\nThis game was ported by Rockstar Seeds who were known for porting other pc games either developed or published by Rockstar such as GTA 4. Team Bondi developed this game for Xbox 360 and Ps3 and a year later, Rockstar Seeds brought it to PC. Like GTA 4, LA Noire isn't really that a good a port, maybe worst if you ask me. There's no mod support so there's nothing anybody can do fix the issues this game has. The PC controls aren't that well so you need a controller. The framerate is capped at 30fps, unless you use the tool I mentioned above, it's easy to use. However some of the physics in the game will be messed up when playing at 60fps, there are videos on Youtube that shows it. But just cap it back to 30fps for a minute and you'll be fine. Also there are plenty of texture pop-ins everywhere you look especially driving. It's obvious that it is a console port.\n\nGRAPHICS\nAs stated there are a ton of texture and assets popping up in the screen but you can handle after a little while. The amount of detail in this game is amazing. As a guy who lives in Los Angeles, I actually recognized a lot of buildings in the game, the amount of work put into the interior, and exterior design of the city is beautiful. As you may know, this game utilizes what's called MotionScan, where the developers used 32 high definition cameras to capture actors faces. While it looks great, less attention I believed was put into the bodies since it was done separately.\n\nSTORY\nYou start as a cop, then rise to becoming a detective. The story is told by the cases you solve, however the actual story to the game does start later near the end when you're in vice. You can pick up the pieces to the story by picking up newspapers as you're doing the earlier cases. The dialogue in this game is well written but there were some times when I felt that the actors where overdoing it. Above all, the story is really good and dark since that's what you would expect from the noire type of entertainment.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nRockstar may have published this game but it doesn't mean you blast gas stations up with a rocket launcher. To simply put, the gameplay is extremely limiting. You can browse the open world detail of LA Noire but there isn't much to do in this game when not doing the cases. There are mini side quests where help people out but they're really short (Lasts about 1-3 minutes). Interrogation in this game consists of asking a question and wondering if that person's telling a truth or lieing and expose them with evidence, or doubt them if you don't believe them. Like other Rockstar games, there are gunplay but in my honest opinion the gunplay in this game feels like an arcade game. It's not the same as GTA or Red Dead Redemption's gunplay which I think is amazing (Rockstar please bring to PC).\n\nCONCLUSION\nI believe you will enjoy this game especially when getting the Complete Edition which has every case the game has to offer. I know I haven't said much about your character Cole Phelps but to honest he has no personality at all. You don't know much about him in a personal level. Kind of like Dark Souls (But not really, bare with me)\n1.) Port isn't that good (30fps lock)\n2.) Environment is really well detailed and amazing\n3,) Don't know much about the character you play as.\n\nIf on sale, get this game and have fun, it's a long game.","May 25","true","37.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrokenNova54/recommended/110800/","BrokenNova54","BrokenNova54","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrokenNova54/","141 products in account","I felt the need to beat the game before I wrote a review on it just so I could get a full-scale view on it. I think I've put about 27 hours into the game before I finally did beat it (and that's without any DLC), so if you're looking for a long game that is worth your money, then L.A. Noire should definitely be considered.\n\nYou play as Cole Phelps, a war veteran that has returned to the States to enlist as a police officer in Los Angeles. Throughout the game, you will solve cases by collecting evidence around crimescenes, conducting interviews on suspects or witnesses, and driving around the city. Lots and LOTS of driving (Since driving will take up a large chunk of time, the game allows you to "fast Travel" to the selected area by holding "E" next to the car). Every so often, you'll get promoted and moved to a different set of cases (Such as Arson, Homicide, and *Motor Crime*). *I'm not familiar with what Motor Crime is known under*\n\nPhelps' life in the war is shown through flashbacks between each case, slowly placing the parts to make a giant picture.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple:  You are assigned a case and you must piece together the clues to solve it.\n\nL.A. Noire offers many features that aren't availible in other detective/mystery games. First, the map. L.A. Noire is a gigantic free-roam map (you'll mainly be driving) that takes a LONG time to drive from one side to the other, even going 80 mph. The city is filled, and I mean FILLED with AI life that walks or drives along through the city, making it feel like an actual city. Many of the places on the map are real places or based on real places that were/are in Los Angeles as well.\n\nAnother feature that I must mention is the interrogation. When you interrogate a person, you will ask them a question, to which they will respond with an answer. You then must decide if they are telling the truth, if you doubt them, or if they are lying (and you can prove that they are lying). You can decide these based on evidence you had found at a crime scene and by looking at the amazing facial expressions the character emits. For example, if a character is staring straight at you while talking, they're probably telling the truth, while if a character keeps avoiding eye contact, you might want to push for more information.\n\nThe facial expressions in the game are spectacular and the mouth-to-voice dialog is spot-on. Yes, they deserved their own little two-sentence paragraph right here, that's how good they are.\n\nI got 27 hours out of the campaign and bought it while it was on sale for $10. After playing, I know that I would have bought it for the full price, due to the well-planned and just delicate features that the game highlights.\n\nI must mention one bug that I had with the game...at times, the game would run slow. Most of the time, it ran smoothly and I had no problem with it, but at times, (when Rockstar was busy perhaps) the game would be slightly laggy. Not enough to make the game unplayable, but enough to be quite annoying. Fortunately, if I left and came back a few hours later, I would experience no lag.\n\nFinally, I want to promote the different action there is. Often while working a case, you'll be driving and get a call over the radio to respond to a street crime, essentially a side mission. There are many different types of action you will face in the game. There are car chases, police shootouts, tracking missions (missions where you follow the suspect without being seen), running-for-your-life-missions, and many more.\n\nOverall, I give the game a 9/10.\n\n","November 4, 2014","true","32.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The technology is nothing short of breathtaking and well worth it as a tour de force of what great tech can add to a game.\n\nThe gameplay feature of reading the charactors tells is, i think, a great inovation and also, a difficult whip to crack. It can feel a little lopsided as some of the acting i over egged and thus paints the conversion as somewhat bipolar.\nAlthough this could of been negated by yet more acting, I can understand that the complexity of such would of either burnt out the actors or moved the game into a different year for completion.\n\nI've heard of the heartache associated with the production of the game and can understand why. Its easy to dismiss when coming from a place of ignorance with some of those slight bugs but when looked at as a whole, the game broke some ground, not only in gameplay but technology aswell, not to mention tying them together. I applaud the huge undertaking this game was.\n\nOne thing that was a little underwhelming though.....the driving... its not a driving game as we already know, its really a detective game but the driving elements, for me, could of been more fun with you being driven around rather than do the driving. I like driving games but when the driving is profuctory rather than part of the game, its best left out. Would of really enjoyed being driven around and take in the sights, scouting for suspects etc....perhaps have a little gun fight along the way etc. I think that would of lended better to a detective game than a sort of limited driving sim with lowend mechanics.\n\nLast thoughts, although the main portion of development missed the driving aspects its understandable when you have such attention paid to a rather breathtaking level of charactor detail and nuance.","February 8, 2015","true","72.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

You play as Cole Phelps, a detective who must work his way through the LAPD, solving cases and making arrests. This is one of the best games I've ever played, and I sincerely congratulate Rockstar on their fine work.\nFirstly, it should be known that the voicework and character animations in this game are fantastic; without this, the game wouldn't work half as well as it did. The characters move and interact seamlessly, due to the innovative use of motion capture technology. During interviews, the player has to read into facial expressions and determine whether a suspect is lying or telling the truth. Due to the impressive animations on display, you can read every eye twitch, uneasy posture and downward glance. These interview sections are the highlight of the game, and it was genuinely entertaining to complete them using evidence and intuition.\nThe basic game mechanics function just like any other Rockstar game; a large (beautifully made) open world, in this case, the grime and glamour of 1950's Los Angeles. You can roam the city on foot or in a vehicle, resolving street crime cases and responding to pleas for police intervention. During a case, you'll often have to travel around the city to meet suspects and other characters, so you'll easily notice the size and attention to detail put into the open world. Additionally, during a case you have to analyse different pieces of evidence, and you'll quickly learn how to integrate these pieces of evidence into the case. It was truly immersive to act like a proper detective, and fans of old crime shows will be delighted here.\nWithout giving anything away, the story is quite investing, and you'll find yourself truly interested in Cole Phelps' story. I don't want to spoil anything, but Rockstar really knows how to make a decent narrative.\nThe only flaw with this game is the horrible optimisation for PC; the graphics are high quality and very consistent, but the port is not well optimised at all. I can barely maintain an acceptable framerate throughout the game, but I persisted due to the quality of the game content. This may be my own error due to using an AMDD Graphics card.\nOverall, L.A Noire is a highly worthwhile and entertaining experience. The immersive story and gameplay really held me right to the end, but the poor optimisation is the only thing holding this game back from a 10. Well crafted, and I'd love to see a sequel to this one. 9.5 / 10","July 30, 2014","true","22.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ocsalevs/recommended/110800/","ocsalevs","ocsalev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ocsalevs/","54 products in account","Usually I try to finish the games I start as quickly as possible. I do the side quests, I try some achievements, but before playing any other game I try to finish what I started. That’s not the case with LA Noire: I avoid playing it. Why? Because it is in another league completely. The game is so good I’m taking my time to finish it. Literally MONTHS. I simply don’t want to end the story too quickly, I’m sipping it.\nThe graphics are amazing, playing in 1080p with ‘quality’ settings and DX11 is an incredible experience. On the downside, there’s a 30fps lock, but that doesn’t compromise the gameplay because the action isn’t frantic. I find the game to be historically accurate as well. It definitely portrays the beginning of the American “Golden Age” (check the “Old Economy Steven” MEME for further references) in a clear-cut manner. There’s a “Bukowskian” atmosphere surrounding the setting and the characters (Bukowski was living in Los Angeles during the 40’s and both “Ham on Rye” and “Factotum” are accurate descriptions of that period). Coincidence or not, there’s a character in the game named “Bekowsky”...\nThe characters are cynical, disillusioned, smoking drunkards, racist sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the “noir femme fatales” shares many of the features of the male characters. LA is portrayed as a XX century Babylonian city packed with all sorts of lowlifes, degenerates, powerful and perverted directors and producers (L.A. didn't changed all that much, huh?). Due to its dedication to the Noir genre the game ends up rated Mature. This definitely isn’t a game for young gents. There’s plenty of nudity in some crime scenes, and the developers don’t hide anything, which is great, otherwise the game couldn’t qualify as a proper Noir-detective title.\nSince I have already established that this game is a marvelous piece of art, let’s see the cons:\n•	30 fps lock.\n•	Rockstar Social Club is required to play the game.\n•	The aforementioned Rockstar Social Club will eventually request your password, and you won’t remember it because the password needs to be 300 characters long, with 20 special characters, numbers and 125 capital letters. Why? Why??\n•	Every time you update the Rockstar Social Club, which is mandatory, otherwise the game won’t start… it’ll request your password again. And guess what: that 300 characters password you created 4 months ago won’t work because YOU WON’T REMEMBER IT. And when you request to reset it, all sorts of issues are going to popup. Seriously, you can count on it.\n•	Rockstar Social Club again. It’s useless. It’s dead weight and it’s sadistic towards the gamers. Steam offers everything a gamer needs, we don’t need extra-layers of crappy proprietary-software between us and the fun. It’s some sort of annoyance toll.\n•	Rockstar Social Club is worse than Uplay . There, I said it.\n\nOther than that the game is a 10/10.","December 26, 2015","true","47.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Noire is a dark, stylish game not really like anything else by Rockstar Games. Instead of being the anti-hero, you play as beat policeman and war veteran Cole Phelps in his mission up the LAPD ranks.\n\nThe game looks decent enough for its age. The real advertised feature of this game was the facial capture, which is extremely well done, even in gameplay. However, this comes with two critical drawbacks. Firstly, in order for the animations to keep up, the game is capped at a "cinematic" 30FPS, so for many PC gamers, it may not seem like it runs very well. Secondly, although the faces are extremely detailed and animated, the bodies lack this advanced animation. Because of that, the model quality seems very inconsistent, especially when someone is lying, as their bodies hardly move, or flail around unrealistically, while their faces are completely animated. To substitute for this, some actors decided to do extremely over-the-top telltale facial signs to show lying, as they could not effectively communicate this with their body language. Other than these drawbacks, engine and visual wise, the game is fine, with a detailed, stylised city to roam around in.\n\nThe soundtrack and audio in general for the game is superb. The soundtrack fits well with the theme, and the radio is authentic era radio broadcasts, and brilliant voice acting mean that the game is brilliant in the audio department, which really helps with the 'immersion' (sorry for using a buzzword) when playing the game.\n\nGameplay wise, despite the more focused story, it plays a bit like Grand Theft Auto when roaming the city. This isn't really a bad thing, as the gameplay feels familiar and flows correctly to allow L.A. Noire to be an easy game to pick up and start playing. This does bring in another small problem though, the investigating. Because there are a lot of gamers now, many of them may not be that good at the old adventure-game style gaming. In order to compensate for this, Rockstar and Team Bondi implemented a lot of hand-holding functions, which unfortunately prevents the gameplay from reaching its true maximum potential. The game never becomes complex, and investigations are held back by lack of difficulty and consequence.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, the game, considering the average triple-A games of today, is unique, especially when stood side-by-side with Rockstar's more famous work. The attention to detail and appealing gameplay, along with the brilliant audio and focus on story means that despite its flaws, I have no problem recommending this game to people who want to play a modern adventure game.","May 6, 2015","true","10.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For starters I was actually amazed that L.A. Noire was the first console game that had near-flawless if not flawless anti-aliasing. I kid you not, you could take a look at the telephone wires from up close or from afar and there would be no jaggies. Nevertheless, I attempted to convince myself that my mind was playing tricks on me and that some anti-alised objects were just polished to perfection. I was partially right; it's only the telephone wires, cars and some other objects that have no jaggies.\n\nThe graphics settings for the PC version are:\n\nAntialiasing: 1-3\nAnisotropic Filtering: 1-4\nAmbient Occlusion - Yes/No\nFacial Quality - Quality/Performance\nTexture Quality - Quality/Performance\nShadow Quality - Quality/Performance/Balanced\nLighting Quality - Quality/Performance/Balanced\nEnvironment Map - Quality/Performance/Balanced\nLevel of Detail Quality - Quality/Performance/Balanced\nScreen Space Ambient Occlusion - On/Off\nGlobal Detail Level - Quality/Performance/Balanced\n\nAnd there's also a command line for various set-up options.\n\nIf you have a high end PC you can get 30 FPS if you pick all Quality.\nHowever, if you choose Performance, you ALSO get 30 FPS.\n\nSo they converted the game to PC yet they forgot to raise the FPS cap, hmmm weird. Honestly, I did not notice much difference between the PS3 and the PC version graphic-wise. I mean all those extra graphics options are nice for the ego-boost but I had a hard time telling the difference especially with the frequent texture popping.\n\nWhat I mean is that the game's graphics suffer immensely when you drive your vehicle for instance. Objects just pop out of thin air and grow out of the ground slowly enough for you to notice. You may drive and look ahead at some of the box-like buildings when all of a sudden they begin to acquire the necessary features such as windows, doors, color, etc.\n\nAlso, in many instances the game practically plays by itself. Again, that was done with the controller movement in mind. You may run after someone through the rooftops, fire escape ladders, alleyways and what not and be automatically redirected to pursue the suspect. The game GUIDES you forces you after the suspect because it assumes you may not be able to make that sharp turn with your controller; all you'll have to hold is the "forward" button.\n\n-----\nPart 2\n\nMake no mistake, this is not GTA set in the 1940's. There are no friends to call, bars, memorable and charismatic characters, outrageous cinematics, funny encounters, motorcycles, TV shows, dating, witty radio broadcasts describing the decadent elements of American Culture. This is a very mature, somewhat dry and serious game, perhaps it is too serious. There is a fair amount of thin adult humor that might not even catch your attention but the dialogue is extremely well written to say the least. The game plays and feels just like one of those black and white detective movies. Maybe the game is too serious in fact, there is little room for fun. Nor is there a single set objective mission to complete per se. You just keep the L.A. populace safe from petty and serious criminals.\n\nIf anything, the game is divided into chapters much like in Mafia 2 and there are some miscellaneous missions to complete aside from the main story. Each story starts with a few seconds video showing what happens to the victim. There are actually clues within those short videos that might help you solve the crime better and faster. So this is like a sand box game with no toys to play. Sure there are 30 secret cars spread out around the city to find and there are badges and newspapers to look for (if you like achievements) but otherwise there is little to do in the city.\n\nThe driving is very unrealistic, it feels arcadish but at least you don't get annoyed every time you try to make a sharp turn and attempt to regain controls. However this unrealistic consolish driving feels out of place in this serious game. I guess they had to make it easy for the controller. At first you may think to yourself "wow, how did I manage to make that turn, not run over the pedestrian and still be able to pursue that vehicle" - again, the game helps you do all that.\n\nFor the most part the shooting is okay except when it's not. True, I still prefer the mouse to a controller but once you enter a confined area, the constricted camera speed will force to you aim as slowly as you would with one of those analog sticks.\n\nCrime-solving is where the game shines, or supposed to shine at least. Sometimes it will get tedious and samey even though the scenery, the objects, the part of town and the characters are different. At least it got tedious sometimes in my case because I had to pay attention to almost everything. If you have an analytical mind, it will help. If you have a short-attention spam, then good luck. Every case requires your utmost attention and even if you mess up with most clues, facts and interrogations you will still complete the mission only with a low rank. As a result, you will advance slightly slower in the game and have access to less suits, fame and what not. So there is no real sense of danger or fear of messing up HOWEVER you cannot reload your game if the interrogation goes awry for one reason or another, not unless you want to start the chapter all over again. So there is plenty of incentive to not mess up; you want gain those experience points and exchange them for intuition or ask the community option to help you conduct interrogations more effectively.\n\nIn the end, the 6-year period to make the game and a million dollar debt among other things forced Rockstar to close down their Team Bondi Studio. What can I say, next time, try to make the game faster and RELEASE THE PC VERSION ALONG WITH THE CONSOLE VERSION TO INCREASE THE REVENUE.\n\nThank you very much.","November 27, 2013","true","38.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Probably the best detective game I have played since the Gabriel Knight Series  (which was just re-released this past week).  It can be a little racy at times with stereotypes, language and nudity so it is definitely not for the under 16 set or those that find that subject matter offensive.\n\nBut I especially enjoy racing from map end to map end trying to see how fast i can go and trying out different vehicles.  I remember taking a International truck from the Railroad Depot crime scene and had my partner quip, "Really Cole?  What are people going to think when we show up in this thing."  Also funny quips in coroner, crime scene vehicles and others.\n\nWell worth the money especially if you can get it on one of the sales they have it on it from time to time.   Some people do have a problem with playing the game on the default parameters, but you can quickly change a few things out and get up to speed in very little time by monkeying with the DX, thread and other graphic settings.","October 18, 2014","true","61.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game may not be on the top shelf of quality, barely fitting 'the solid-good' one. And yet it IS a good game. And not in the way of 'guilty pleasure' good, no. This title is a great example of a sereis in which the second one corrects every mistake of the first one.\n\nUnfortunatelly we do not have the possibility to play second one and we are left with this flawed piece of a 'sketch'. And whilst it is a quite nice idea for a drawing, it is not by any means perfect one. Starting with a mediocre graphics, very hard to rate depending on which side we are looking at (faces and interiors are really nice, the rest is... meh). The gameplay is I'd say quite poor and very repetitive.\n\nAnd yet this title took more than 20 hours of my life. And I do not regret it at all. Because as far as the plot, the character, the music adn the climat goes the game is just outstanding! I could really, (without any problems whatsoever) close an eye on a technical side in this case.

One of the best games out there along with GTA 5. This game is a pure classic.\n\nHOWEVER, HOWEVER, HOWEVER, there is one thing about L.A. Noire that pisses me off tremendously. The game is capped at 30 frames per second. As a PC gamer with a powerful rig, this pisses me off because i play most of my games (90% of them) at 60 fps and higher. Playing at 30 fps did not seem right at all. It feels sluggish, and it does not look smooth at all (to me at least).\n\nNonetheless, you can uncap the framerate by using WideScreenFixer. You will be able to play it at 60 fps if your PC is powerful enough but then uncapping the framerate would mess up one thing. The driving. Driving is one of the key elements of this game and after you have uncapped the framerate, driving physics will be slightly altered. It will be harder to drive around as the vehicle will feel "floaty" like how the driving in GTA 4 feels like. But if you can get used to that, then there should not be a problem at all.\n\nThat would be the only issue in this game so if you can overcome it, you will have a great experience playing it. I would definitely persuade anyone out there to purchase L.A. Noire.","June 17, 2015","true","7.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The game play itself isn't anything spectacular, but the world that Rockstar has created in 1947 Los Angeles is really something to experience.\n\nI have spent hours just driving around, sightseeing, listening to the radio, finding various secrets. My dad lived in L.A. In the mid 50s, so I got to share a bit of his youthful memories through the game. He even recognized the song playing on the radio!\n\nAn interesting side note: Rockstar used over 180,000 aerial photographs in order to more accurately reproduce that noire feeling of 1940s Los Angeles. Actual radio broadcasts, commercials, and music (The Bickersons, The Jack Benny Program, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald) were also used to further immerse the player.\n\nA fun game, but if you're at all into 40s Americana it's worth buying just to cruise down Holywood Blvd in one of the 95 vintage cars listening to Bing Crosby.\n\nI certainly enjoyed it!","May 18, 2013","true","228.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

BUT, there are other things that should have been done better, basically because somebody else has already done them right.\n\n+ Acting, both faces and voices, are excellent and interviews are quite fun.\n+ The cases are interesting, altough sometimes a bit predictable and linear. Sometimes you say things you souldn t have known (because you missed that clue before or changed the order in wich you do something) and thats quite odd, I d really like there where different ways to solve a case or even fail it. There is some of that, but it doesn t really work that way (DLCs do it a bit better )\n\n- But what I like the least about this game is combat. I realise it is very story driven and you can skip action parts if you fail them a few times, but that s not an excuse for faulty controls. Usually they are not a mess, but just sloppy enough to get into my nerves from time to time. Like when you just stand there eating bullets instead of getting into cover, or running into walls while chasing a suspect.\n\n- I d like it existed the chance to go for peaceful solutions to some cases (street crimes for instance), like trying to talk a barricated suspect into surrendering instead of just shoting them.","January 7, 2015","true","39.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gun action was also basic and easy to understand , from taking cover to blind firing your ememies or even just straight ramboing it.\n\nTaking the vehicles back to 1940's was a very neat idea, driving old cars was fun for a change wrather than the ones in the GTA series.

The game play itself isn't anything spectacular, but the world that Rockstar has created in 1947 Los Angeles is really something to experience.\n\nI have spent hours just driving around, sightseeing, listening to the radio, finding various secrets. My dad lived in L.A. In the mid 50s, so I got to share a bit of his youthful memories through the game. He even recognized the song playing on the radio!\n\nAn interesting side note: Rockstar used over 180,000 aerial photographs in order to more accurately reproduce that noire feeling of 1940s Los Angeles. Actual radio broadcasts, commercials, and music (The Bickersons, The Jack Benny Program, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald) were also used to further immerse the player.\n\nA fun game, but if you're at all into 40s Americana it's worth buying just to cruise down Holywood Blvd in one of the 95 vintage cars listening to Bing Crosby.\n\nI certainly enjoyed it!","May 18, 2013","true","228.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some tracks can wear on the nerves, but the action tracks put you in the moment.\n\nThis game plays very well on Windows 7, but crashes do happen on occasion.\n\nOverall, this is a very excellent title, and the actors are superb, for the most part. If you watch Mad Men, you may see more familiar faces than just Phelps. This is a huge leap for in-game visuals, as the talking heads do look very good most of the time. Some glitches can be jarring, but they're few.\n\nIt's a large game, and requres a lot of RAM and a very capable video card.

Noire is a GTA where you play the cops, but that would be selling the game short. It's definitely not as "sandbox" as its counterpart, since you play through each case in succession. However, every single one of your decisions can have an impact on the rest of the case; and your career.\n\nGraphically speaking, there's only one thing that bugs me: the 1940s Los Angeles seems to lack detail, most notably because of a very aggressive LOD policy. Some textures are also low resolution. But it's a very minor thing.\n\nThe facial animation of this game is just insane and brings an incredible amount of life to the characters; they're really believable, and you can observe the suspects while you're taking notes — it can help you determine whether they're lying or saying the truth. The acting is top notch, and does not seem forced for the most part.\n\nThe game is slightly confusing at first, but the immersion it offers afterwards is breathtaking.

Noire attempts to adopt an open-world style gameplay, and in some way, succeeds. However, the repetitive gameplay that surrounds and revolves around flipping clues around in your hand and judging whether someone is lying or not from their ambiguous facial expressions, lets the game down as it quickly became more of a bore than wanting more. The campaign experience was not all that disappointing though, because having an interest in the crime/mystery genre certainly allowed for some wider imagination. 7/10","November 29, 2013","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The addition of 'real' facial expressions may seem a bit gimmicky but is essential when questioning suspects. It is up to the game player to determine whether suspects are telling the truth or lying, and this can be done by carefully watching facial expressions. However, if you accuse a suspect of lying you will need to have some kind of proof to back it up. Graphically, the developers has done an amazing job - there does not seem to be a noticable repetition of buildings within the map. Vehicles are rendered beautifully and appear to be fairly faithful to the real things. It is a shame that the game is limited to 30fps on the PC but it is a solid 30fps (played with Fraps running to check). The XBox 360 version has moments where the FPS drops well below 30. Sound is used very well, using a dramatic score when something important is happening in the game. Music is also used during the searching of clues and helps the game player stay within the 'search area'. NPCs have dialogue but it can be quite repetitive. Sound effects are spot on, even down to the sound of aircraft flying high up overhead and chirping birds, etc.\n\nL.A. Noire will appeal to gamers who like to think and solves clues. It may appear to be similar to the GTA series but the missions are in no way similar. If you are an arcade game fan this game will not appeal as it is very difficult to pick it up for a quick blast.","February 23, 2014","true","98.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArrenDusk/recommended/110800/","ArrenDusk","Arren","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArrenDusk/","1337 products in account","L.A. Noire, by Rockstar and Team Bondi, is, without a doubt, a unique experience. The advanced facial technology which is by far the game's most famous feature really is incredible and for that alone everyone should try it out because there's nothing like it.\n\nIt's a slow-paced, methodical game. There are action sequences but these are an exception, not the rule, to this game. This game's main strength lies in its investigation and interrogation sequences, coupled with excellent acting and good plot. Note that I'm typing "acting" and not "voice acting". The technology in this game has finally reached the point where I can say that every character in this game is acting, and not just lending their voice to the game.\n\nYou can totally mess up in your cases, by the way. Like completely. But even if this happens to you, the main storyline will still keep progressing, albeit in dynamic and different ways. Your partners, peers, and superiors will comment on how you couldn't get that one case done, or if you did, praising you on your foresight. I found this really neat and a lot more investigation games should go for this dynamic direction as well instead of keeping you stuck until you find the perfect solution. (I'm looking at you, Phoenix Wright, and some point and click adventures as well)\n\nAs the title implies, it perfectly evokes that feeling of a 40's Los Angeles in a dark, depressing, noir setting. The vehicles, buildings, city, music, up to the radio commercials themselves are spot on. There is freeroam as you'd expect to find in your average GTA, and street crimes which are always action oriented as fun sidequests. The story of LAPD detective Cole Phelps is very interesting and involved, and while this game is about solving crimes, it's also about telling the story of this man, who isn't perfect, has its ups and downs, and is just amazing to go through. Fantastic protagonist.\n\nI will say though that the ending felt kind of rushed, and there were a few loose ends. Closure where it was mainly needed was given though, so don't worry, this game didn't pull a Mass Effect 3.\n\nMore games like L.A. Noire need to exist. Even though I've had a LOT of cases to solve, I'm still yearning for more, and I'll definitely replay this after a few years at the very least so my memories won't be as clear and I can fumble about again, because it actually makes it enjoyable and realistic for me, that even the star detective such as Cole could get fooled and get it all wrong once or twice.\n\nIt's not all rainbows and sunshine though! This game is a bad PC port. Rockstar are known for being subpar when it comes to the PC, and L.A. Noire is no exception. I've had to open up a bunch of launch commands, even get a .dll file to get my game into a playable state. It doesn't help that its capped at 30 FPS either, because according to Team Bondi, the facial animations could get wonky were you to go any higher than that. 60 FPS fixes were applied and this wasn't seen though, so it's highly debatable.\n\nIf you can get this on the PS3 or Xbox 360, then do so as you won't have to deal with these issues. If you can't though, at least try to give it a go anyway because like I said, this is an awesome game if it happens to like your PC and everyone should play it. I'm all for a sequel or a game set in the same style as this one!","May 10, 2013","true","64.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Tying the unique tech to an interrogation mechanic is a great idea, though sometimes the interrogations themselves can be frustrating and illogical, even to the point that I'd just restart the mission if it became a wash. Shooting and driving are both passable and functional, except for a frustrating sequence in the finale which involves way more shooting than the rest of the game.\n\nWhat I love most about this game is its adherence to Noir style, complete with all the backstabbing intrigue that comes with it. Nearly every Noir trope is in full effect here, and there's some truly excellent acting to be found, on par with Hollywood productions, probably because there are a great deal of talented character actors involved that you'll probably recognize from this thing or that. The story is solid and kept me hooked, and its final scene is brilliantly delivered. As with others I've enjoyed, this is a game I recommend not for the strength of its mechanics, but for its "feel", and in terms of making you feel like a hard-boiled Noir detective, you won't find anything better on the market.","December 27, 2011","true","62.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't let the low play time fool you!\n\nLA Noire is a wonderful experience in gaming. There aren't many games like this out there, which is a shame. Take on the role of a Police officer in post WWII Los Angeles. The city has been lovingly re-created with all the streets and famous landmarks. However, don't expect a GTA style sandbox; this game is very linear and all about the main story. Also, while the city has been expertly crafted, you won't be given much reason to explore it; no non-mission specific buildings are able to be entered and there is very little to no interactivity with anything in the city. Getting past those faults though, this is a great detective game with a unique twist. You must read the facial expressions of the people you interogate and make assumptions based on that. While this doesn't always work smoothly, it's super cool trying to read the characters and try and tell if they're lying or not. This game also has a great style. If you couldn't tell, it's a classic Noire style presentation and can even be played in black and white (recommended for that legitimate noire feel). This game is not for everyone. It can be slow and after finishing the game, some may not want to replay missions when they already know whodunnit. If it does pique your interest though, pick this up on sale.","June 3, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is ♥♥♥♥♥♥IC, the gameplay is GTA mashed with CHRISTIAN VALUES, sounds and graphics are GOOD, people can RELATE to the characters + the characters are strong.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uchuu/recommended/110800/","Uchuu","Uchuu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uchuu/","1937 products in account","A great game that has an interesting setting and gameplay mechanic.\n\nThe game world is based around post-WWII LA.  The story is focused around detective work on various cases that range from traffic crimes, to homicide, to arson, and vice cases.  Each case has clues you have to discover as the scene and from the various people you question about the case.  Finding more clues gives you more options in questioning.  The question mechanics involves you paying attention to how the person acts, basically you’re trying to tell if they did the crime, had a part in it, or are innocent.  This mechanic also extends to trying to get information out of some people, i.e. do you gently try get more information or go on the aggressive and force them to tell you.  The better you do at questioning and clue finding will result in a higher case score.\n\nIf you have trouble questioning people there are points you can spend to either narrow the choices or if you’re online can see what the majority did.  These points are earned through various success levels on completion of a case, i.e. the better you do the more points you get.\n\nThe cases are divided into the various desks you work at while on the force.  Each desk also represents a promotion in rank on the force.  Due to the theme of the game some of these cases can be extremely graphic and like with the age and culture your dealing with the language can also be mature.\n\nGameplay involves you or your partner driving to the scene of the crime.  If you drive you'll be able to do side missions, street crimes, that come in from dispatch while you’re on the road.  These street crimes are not the best element of the game as they mostly have you running and gunning down criminals, they get repetitive quickly.  Once at the scene of the crime you’re able to look for clues and get information from other characters (other officers, the coroner, and witnesses), from there it tracking down leads, questioning people, and the occasional car chase.\n\nOverall, the game does provide a unique experience and is definitely worth picking up.  However, you should buy the Complete Edition as it adds a number of cases that extend gameplay, without them, I wouldn't advise picking up the game.  The reason is because there are some desks that don't have many cases and the additional content adds a lot more meat to the game.\n\nIf you don’t own the game and see it on for a 75% off or higher sale I’d highly recommend picking it up.  Game length would be about 40-50 hours if you do most or all of what it has to offer.","November 30, 2013","true","56.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Noire is a very entertaining action detective simulator that has incredible attention to detail and a phenomenal animation system. Yet sadly, its 30fps cap, and dodgy controls at times leave a small void inside me. Even with its flaws, it’s a very fun and mature title, and worth the price of admission. If you like GTA/Mafia II style open world games, but want the intellectualism offered only by more mature titles, then this is for you. It definitely makes you think, and punishes you for poor detective skills, so good problem solving is a must. There are also some pretty awesome action moments with a Hollywood feel to them, and usually don’t disappoint.

The characters' facial animations have been done in a totally new way and it looks superb. Their expressions change realistically according to what they are saying and in what context or mood they are in. Surely all the software developers are going to have to use this technique with their characters from now on? Just having lip syncing without facial expressions won't cut it anymore after this.\nThe game itself is original and compelling. I can't think of another game anything like it.

Your job as a new dectective is to scout the scene, find clues, find the suspects and interogate them using your intuition and facts to chase down the killer. This is just one example of fantastic cases that you have to figure out and bring down the killers and criminals who commit crimes across L.A.\nYou play as Phelps, a World War 2 veteran and all around do-gooder. Phelps is an honest man who has a strict honor system and puts his all into a case that he is working on. Phelps starts out as a common on the beat cop who likes to put his nose where it usually doesnt belong. He quickly excells through the ranks and without giving any spoilers he becomes a hero cop and is promoted to detective on the trafiic cases. I find this incredibly interesting since you dont immediately start out as this recognized protaganist in a game filled with crime and criminals. But these guys and gals you come across in L.A arent people you really expect to be murders and rapists. These people are your average run of the mill, hard working citizens who just try to make a living in the city.\nBut looks are deceiving. Some of the citizens are actually complete psychopaths!\nWhile the core story is really interesting the gameplay is somewhat lacking and the visuals if inspected have small bugs. I found on serveral occasions that some doors i tied walking through would sometimes bug and stay perma shut until i restarted the game. I dont know if that was a problem with my PC or just in general a problem. However I have never encountered it another game. Anyway combat reminds me alot of Red Dead and they are made by the same developer so it was good to see that the combat was very detailed and carefully made. Combat really only comes into play every now and then so if you are a gamer that needs tons of action L.A Noire is not for you.\nGamers with patience and pay very close attention to facts and facial expressions will succed in L.A Noire on some occasions. (there is a part where you have to deal with an actress, nasty buisness and very deceiving) L.A Noire also requires gamers who are very mature because there is nudity in L.A Noire and it will go into detail about the cause of death. So if you are quesy I wouldnt recommend this game for you.\nFinally the last thing to talk about is the enemy mechanics and investigation mechanics. These are really the most important parts of the game and sometimes they do incredibly well. On very few occasions the Ai would suddenly come out of cover shooting but instead of returning back to cover, they stayed there trying to shoot me. Once they needed to reload you could easily gun them down and fire at the next enemy. Like I said, this rarely happened so i wouldnt really be too concerned about it. The criminals who arent firing at you are usually running away from you or trying to fist fight you. Never once encountered any problems with the runners or the fighters. Fighters usually ended with you knocking them out and arresting them, and the runners could completely take a turn for the worst. On one occasion, the criminal took a man hostage and you have to gun the criminal down but be careful not to shoot the hostage or then you will be bagging a body and letting the criminal have the last laugh. But in another spot, there is an  insane man that you have to run down and catch before he can fatally hurt himself. I loved parts of the game like this and suggest you do the side quests that come up as they have their own unique part in the game.\nNow to the investigation mechanics, these are incredibly well thought out and cleverly displayed! When you enter a crime scene a chime and mystery music begins to play. This all together adds to the atmosphere of a late 1940s crime thriller and does an excellant job at setting the mood. Also the music plays a part when you are investigating, when you here a chime that mean that there is something that could be a clue. I think this is all together inventive and really nails a video game thriller. I recommend this game but am going to give it a\n7.5 / 10\n\nMainly because the lack of combat will push some of the gamers who need action in the game, another reason is some bugs really just throwed me off.","January 6, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Noire, by Rockstar and Team Bondi, is, without a doubt, a unique experience. The advanced facial technology which is by far the game's most famous feature really is incredible and for that alone everyone should try it out because there's nothing like it.\n\nIt's a slow-paced, methodical game. There are action sequences but these are an exception, not the rule, to this game. This game's main strength lies in its investigation and interrogation sequences, coupled with excellent acting and good plot. Note that I'm typing "acting" and not "voice acting". The technology in this game has finally reached the point where I can say that every character in this game is acting, and not just lending their voice to the game.\n\nYou can totally mess up in your cases, by the way. Like completely. But even if this happens to you, the main storyline will still keep progressing, albeit in dynamic and different ways. Your partners, peers, and superiors will comment on how you couldn't get that one case done, or if you did, praising you on your foresight. I found this really neat and a lot more investigation games should go for this dynamic direction as well instead of keeping you stuck until you find the perfect solution. (I'm looking at you, Phoenix Wright, and some point and click adventures as well)\n\nAs the title implies, it perfectly evokes that feeling of a 40's Los Angeles in a dark, depressing, noir setting. The vehicles, buildings, city, music, up to the radio commercials themselves are spot on. There is freeroam as you'd expect to find in your average GTA, and street crimes which are always action oriented as fun sidequests. The story of LAPD detective Cole Phelps is very interesting and involved, and while this game is about solving crimes, it's also about telling the story of this man, who isn't perfect, has its ups and downs, and is just amazing to go through. Fantastic protagonist.\n\nI will say though that the ending felt kind of rushed, and there were a few loose ends. Closure where it was mainly needed was given though, so don't worry, this game didn't pull a Mass Effect 3.\n\nMore games like L.A. Noire need to exist. Even though I've had a LOT of cases to solve, I'm still yearning for more, and I'll definitely replay this after a few years at the very least so my memories won't be as clear and I can fumble about again, because it actually makes it enjoyable and realistic for me, that even the star detective such as Cole could get fooled and get it all wrong once or twice.\n\nIt's not all rainbows and sunshine though! This game is a bad PC port. Rockstar are known for being subpar when it comes to the PC, and L.A. Noire is no exception. I've had to open up a bunch of launch commands, even get a .dll file to get my game into a playable state. It doesn't help that its capped at 30 FPS either, because according to Team Bondi, the facial animations could get wonky were you to go any higher than that. 60 FPS fixes were applied and this wasn't seen though, so it's highly debatable.\n\nIf you can get this on the PS3 or Xbox 360, then do so as you won't have to deal with these issues. If you can't though, at least try to give it a go anyway because like I said, this is an awesome game if it happens to like your PC and everyone should play it. I'm all for a sequel or a game set in the same style as this one!","May 10, 2013","true","64.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I personally give it a 10/10. Because it has a fantastic story that is unparalleled even in today's movies and books. The game play is amazing, and to be honest im gonna leave it towards other people to go on about that. I just wanted to put my peice out there saying that this game is worth your money.\n\nBut also because i wanted to end all the claims of how bad a port it really is. Yes it is not the best port, but compared to  GTA IV and its GFWL port, it's pretty damn good. People saying 30fps is a con are just wrong, flat out wrong. People need to put it under a plus. 30fps is so smooth in this game, because the engine was NOT designed for 60fps. I myself have played about half an hour at an uncapped 60fps and i couldn't go on any longer, while yes it looks smooth as ♥♥♥♥, the driving is horrible, like driving on a ice skating rink and the brakes don't work, and the facial animations look worse, they look really stupid and to quote the infamous console peasant cry "60fps is too fast", it is only applicable to L.A. Noire.\n\nTo fix the framerate though because it does have trouble keeping a solid 30fps. Copy and paste this in your command line in the launch options.\n\n-npd -str -nonv\n\nIt works for most people, including me.","March 2, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters' facial animations have been done in a totally new way and it looks superb. Their expressions change realistically according to what they are saying and in what context or mood they are in. Surely all the software developers are going to have to use this technique with their characters from now on? Just having lip syncing without facial expressions won't cut it anymore after this.\nThe game itself is original and compelling. I can't think of another game anything like it.

Your job as a new dectective is to scout the scene, find clues, find the suspects and interogate them using your intuition and facts to chase down the killer. This is just one example of fantastic cases that you have to figure out and bring down the killers and criminals who commit crimes across L.A.\nYou play as Phelps, a World War 2 veteran and all around do-gooder. Phelps is an honest man who has a strict honor system and puts his all into a case that he is working on. Phelps starts out as a common on the beat cop who likes to put his nose where it usually doesnt belong. He quickly excells through the ranks and without giving any spoilers he becomes a hero cop and is promoted to detective on the trafiic cases. I find this incredibly interesting since you dont immediately start out as this recognized protaganist in a game filled with crime and criminals. But these guys and gals you come across in L.A arent people you really expect to be murders and rapists. These people are your average run of the mill, hard working citizens who just try to make a living in the city.\nBut looks are deceiving. Some of the citizens are actually complete psychopaths!\nWhile the core story is really interesting the gameplay is somewhat lacking and the visuals if inspected have small bugs. I found on serveral occasions that some doors i tied walking through would sometimes bug and stay perma shut until i restarted the game. I dont know if that was a problem with my PC or just in general a problem. However I have never encountered it another game. Anyway combat reminds me alot of Red Dead and they are made by the same developer so it was good to see that the combat was very detailed and carefully made. Combat really only comes into play every now and then so if you are a gamer that needs tons of action L.A Noire is not for you.\nGamers with patience and pay very close attention to facts and facial expressions will succed in L.A Noire on some occasions. (there is a part where you have to deal with an actress, nasty buisness and very deceiving) L.A Noire also requires gamers who are very mature because there is nudity in L.A Noire and it will go into detail about the cause of death. So if you are quesy I wouldnt recommend this game for you.\nFinally the last thing to talk about is the enemy mechanics and investigation mechanics. These are really the most important parts of the game and sometimes they do incredibly well. On very few occasions the Ai would suddenly come out of cover shooting but instead of returning back to cover, they stayed there trying to shoot me. Once they needed to reload you could easily gun them down and fire at the next enemy. Like I said, this rarely happened so i wouldnt really be too concerned about it. The criminals who arent firing at you are usually running away from you or trying to fist fight you. Never once encountered any problems with the runners or the fighters. Fighters usually ended with you knocking them out and arresting them, and the runners could completely take a turn for the worst. On one occasion, the criminal took a man hostage and you have to gun the criminal down but be careful not to shoot the hostage or then you will be bagging a body and letting the criminal have the last laugh. But in another spot, there is an  insane man that you have to run down and catch before he can fatally hurt himself. I loved parts of the game like this and suggest you do the side quests that come up as they have their own unique part in the game.\nNow to the investigation mechanics, these are incredibly well thought out and cleverly displayed! When you enter a crime scene a chime and mystery music begins to play. This all together adds to the atmosphere of a late 1940s crime thriller and does an excellant job at setting the mood. Also the music plays a part when you are investigating, when you here a chime that mean that there is something that could be a clue. I think this is all together inventive and really nails a video game thriller. I recommend this game but am going to give it a\n7.5 / 10\n\nMainly because the lack of combat will push some of the gamers who need action in the game, another reason is some bugs really just throwed me off.","January 6, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Noire is a very entertaining action detective simulator that has incredible attention to detail and a phenomenal animation system. Yet sadly, its 30fps cap, and dodgy controls at times leave a small void inside me. Even with its flaws, it’s a very fun and mature title, and worth the price of admission. If you like GTA/Mafia II style open world games, but want the intellectualism offered only by more mature titles, then this is for you. It definitely makes you think, and punishes you for poor detective skills, so good problem solving is a must. There are also some pretty awesome action moments with a Hollywood feel to them, and usually don’t disappoint. Overall I thought it was a good ride while it lasted.","July 18, 2013","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found it very enjoyable, a game full of mystery, with a well written story and interesting characters. Action is well done likewise, but it isn't the main focus of the game, instead it's the process of solving a case, finding the truth even though the harder you go, the harder it is. The whole facial animations are great, in fact there are no animations - the facial expressions are taken from real people. Unfortunately it can fall in the Uncanny Valley at times, but you can't blame it for that since, it's trying to succeed.

Noire is a game released in 2011 by Rockstar Games and Team Bondi. You play as Cole Phelps, who just entered the police department of Los Angeles. You'll play as him, you'll have to solve all sorts of cases. Nearly all the characters of the game are really charismatic, and you'll love some of them and hate others. The story is really attractive and you'll not stop playing this game till you have finish it. When i play it for the first time i was like "Well it just looks like a Movie-Game" then i finished it and i said "Wow, i need to get all achievements for this game !" So i did this, after 40 hours i got them all. If you play the game without trying to get all achievements I guess 10/15hours is enough to finish it, it's already a nice lifetime for a game like that.\nOnce again, Rockstar prove that they can do something else that GTA and that the render is awesome. If you want to get all cases with 5 stars without any guide/walkthrough, i can tell you that you'll have some difficulties.. The game have such a growing difficulty, i mean at the begginning it's quite easy, items you need to find are easy to find, people that you investigate doesn't hide that much their expressions, but when you're at the middle of the game it's getting harder and then at the end, harder again :)\nAs i said before, the story is really branching i mean, i was re-acting as the ingame characters, and the cases are interesting.\nIf i had to rate this game it would be:\n-Graphics 19/20\n-Gameplay 18/20\n-Audio 20/20 (depends of you but, i loved it)\n-Accessibility 18/20\nGLOBAL RATE: 18.75/20\n\nHope you enjoy that review, leave a like if you did :P","February 8, 2015","true","43.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Noire because I enjoyed the story and I found each case to be compelling.  The way it weaved the past into current events and tied things together by the end was legendary.  The way the devs captured the actor's facial expressions, while treading into the uncanny valley big-time, gave this game an amazing quality.  Driving through old time Los Angeles was a lot of fun.  I think this is a game most people will enjoy.\n\nAll that being said sometimes when characters talk their mouths look really wrong.  It looks like the mesh is the wrong shape for the expression ( usually noticable with yelling and other large mouth shapes).  While historically accurate all the cars look way too much alike to necessate the diversity in this game (especially with the frustrating achievement attached to driving them all).  Getting in and out of cars takes flippin' forever.  Special cars that boast a max speed of 140 MPH even at full throtle the game says your max speed even was around 86 MPH.\n\nThe main gameplay element of interrigation is frustrating as they purposefully designed it to not allow you to restart a bad interrigation over without quitting and reloading your last save.  Sure, it opens other opportunities to play through the mission based on failure to catch the person in a lie but that wasn't what I was playing this for.\n\nStory gripes ahead, Spoilers: The love interest in this game looks like a dirty bag of melted action figures so when Cole started persuing her romatically I didn't buy it for a second.  You are a war hero get a woman that is worth the trouble. The ending was purposefully unsatisfying but come on give a guy some hope that Cole's work wasn't for nothing.","September 20, 2014","true","54.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is very impressive and it was excellent to see the main plot ticking over in the background whilst you're following a meandering path, which will eventually lead you to said plot.  The graphics and sound effects were excellent and joined with the innovative element of interrogation you have a winning formula that deserves to be a big fan favourite.  Also hats off to attention to detail with the vehicles.

Even though I enjoyed its setting and atmosphere, I can't help but think that there are so many things that could have been improved - such as the storytelling (after 35 hours of gameplay I still can't say that I fully understand the main character's motivations) or graphics (beautifully done faces plastered on fake looking bodies didn't exactly work for me). The city is unnecessarily big and, sadly, feels quite empty. Perhaps the game would have been better off without the forced sandbox feel. However, I enjoyed the majority of the cases and would deffinitely want something similar to be developed in the future - just without the aforementioned faults. I'd rate L.A. Noire 7 out of 10 - even with all its small issues, the game managed to hook me for the whole 35 hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uchuu/recommended/110800/","Uchuu","Uchuu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uchuu/","1937 products in account","A great game that has an interesting setting and gameplay mechanic.\n\nThe game world is based around post-WWII LA.  The story is focused around detective work on various cases that range from traffic crimes, to homicide, to arson, and vice cases.  Each case has clues you have to discover as the scene and from the various people you question about the case.  Finding more clues gives you more options in questioning.  The question mechanics involves you paying attention to how the person acts, basically you’re trying to tell if they did the crime, had a part in it, or are innocent.  This mechanic also extends to trying to get information out of some people, i.e. do you gently try get more information or go on the aggressive and force them to tell you.  The better you do at questioning and clue finding will result in a higher case score.\n\nIf you have trouble questioning people there are points you can spend to either narrow the choices or if you’re online can see what the majority did.  These points are earned through various success levels on completion of a case, i.e. the better you do the more points you get.\n\nThe cases are divided into the various desks you work at while on the force.  Each desk also represents a promotion in rank on the force.  Due to the theme of the game some of these cases can be extremely graphic and like with the age and culture your dealing with the language can also be mature.\n\nGameplay involves you or your partner driving to the scene of the crime.  If you drive you'll be able to do side missions, street crimes, that come in from dispatch while you’re on the road.  These street crimes are not the best element of the game as they mostly have you running and gunning down criminals, they get repetitive quickly.  Once at the scene of the crime you’re able to look for clues and get information from other characters (other officers, the coroner, and witnesses), from there it tracking down leads, questioning people, and the occasional car chase.\n\nOverall, the game does provide a unique experience and is definitely worth picking up.  However, you should buy the Complete Edition as it adds a number of cases that extend gameplay, without them, I wouldn't advise picking up the game.  The reason is because there are some desks that don't have many cases and the additional content adds a lot more meat to the game.\n\nIf you don’t own the game and see it on for a 75% off or higher sale I’d highly recommend picking it up.  Game length would be about 40-50 hours if you do most or all of what it has to offer.","November 30, 2013","true","56.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every animation is more complex than you will see in most games, some sequences will seem like you are watching a live-action movie. It's different from your average GTA/sandbox game(in fact, not much to explore at all), as you will mostly just do your detective work. Interrogating suspects, searching for clues, still ends up being to easy most of the time, the 5-star cases are the only thing that's really challenging. The Homicide section is easily the best part of the game, really enjoyed it (You solve homicides, duh.) Just above-average as a free-world/sandbox game, most collectibles are just too hidden on a very well depicted L.A., it is interesting because there's about 50 references to classic noir movies, but none of them are (or seem to be) related to where they are placed in the game map, and very uninteresting to look for. Seems like they pieced a really good detective game with modern game elements, kind of a game design flaw but you should still get it for the unique game experience.","June 12, 2013","true","73.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The addition of 'real' facial expressions may seem a bit gimmicky but is essential when questioning suspects. It is up to the game player to determine whether suspects are telling the truth or lying, and this can be done by carefully watching facial expressions. However, if you accuse a suspect of lying you will need to have some kind of proof to back it up. Graphically, the developers has done an amazing job - there does not seem to be a noticable repetition of buildings within the map. Vehicles are rendered beautifully and appear to be fairly faithful to the real things. It is a shame that the game is limited to 30fps on the PC but it is a solid 30fps (played with Fraps running to check). The XBox 360 version has moments where the FPS drops well below 30. Sound is used very well, using a dramatic score when something important is happening in the game. Music is also used during the searching of clues and helps the game player stay within the 'search area'. NPCs have dialogue but it can be quite repetitive. Sound effects are spot on, even down to the sound of aircraft flying high up overhead and chirping birds, etc.\n\nL.A. Noire will appeal to gamers who like to think and solves clues. It may appear to be similar to the GTA series but the missions are in no way similar. If you are an arcade game fan this game will not appeal as it is very difficult to pick it up for a quick blast.","February 23, 2014","true","98.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Borrowed and played it on my Playstation 3 for a while and got bored but something about the "Noire" aspect and the era the game is set in drew me back to this title which is why I decided to buy it, this time on PC.\n\nAfter playing just a bit farther than I had in the past, I have to admit that I missed out. I get the hype and I get why people love this game. It has so much more depth as the story progresses. It is beautifully written and most of the actors involved are brilliant (kudos to the casting director!). The story keeps you hooked and if I  was a decade younger I'd be playing this game nonstop from start to finish in one seating.\n\nThe graphic quality is not on par with its PS3 counterpart, it's better. It's a given that you need a decent GPU to run it and fortunately I got a pretty good one installed on my laptop. Control leaves something to be desired since the mouse can't never replace a Dual Shock controller once a game is optimized for said controller which this game certainly is. But it's still more than playable, just needs some getting used to when inspecting a crime scene. In many ways this game is just as good as the PS3 one just with more customizing options. Get yourself a nice controller and you might be able to enjoy this game more. It's such a shame that the game developer (Bondi) is shut down, we need more games with the same innovation they brought to this one. I mean, performance capture for games? It's absolutely brilliant! Hope other devs would look into the same technology and use it to make story-driven games like this one here.\n\nIf you have never played the game or don't have a copy of it on Steam or what have you, get this game. It's a classic (literally)!","December 14, 2013","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You start off as a LAPD officer named Cole Phelps a former 1st Lt. in the U.S. Army that fought in WWII. All the cases are believable and could all happen in real life. When you interrogate people it feels so real. Even though you can tell when someone is lying you have to show proof how you know they're lying through the clues you have found throughout the case. The gameplay mechanics are also beautiful and the game runs smooth, except for a couple of glitches. Ex: A lady waitress glitched inside of me while I was sitting down and her ♥♥♥ was in my face while I was interrogating someone at a club. This definitely gets on the top of my list for best RPG games.\n\nPlot 9.5/10\nMechanics 9/10\nIn total I'd rate this game a 9/10","July 2, 2014","true","25.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game hzs great facial animations that look soo life like, i played this on ps3 and its even better than i remeber. But i do have problems with this game. Like how music plays when you get a inteveiw or interagation response wrong, that is a real problem with this game my only problem. Because it just makes you feel like you could do that better and then like the completionist i am i restart. it takes away and im trying to refraine from using it. Also intution seems to be useless in some respects because its more fun to play without it. If you are planing to play this game please what you want to do is never restart a case, thats what i have done many times and all it dose is take away from the fun. And this game is great everyone interested in a game thats like a movie should try it. This is one of the best games i have played and its fun to get back into it. Other notes about the game is that its better to have the dlc (wich i dont have but the dlc adds more cases wich is more gameplay(i recomend waiting for a sale of the dlc if you want or the goty version i got this game for 5.00 american)). Just I love this game and lots of other people do to if your tihnking about buying this game, then do it and another thing to note when buying. Its a game locked to 30fps (WICH IS NOT A BAD THING). When people see games locked to 30fps they dont want them instantly but 30fps is needed for this game. And if you dont like it you can change it. And the reson for 30fps is because of the facial animations i dont think that, the game is desigend to run the animations in 60fps or higher. And thats probably the same for the new batman game but i digress this game is amazing and get it if you have, the money or patcents to wait for a sale.\n","September 30, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/110800/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","After 40 hours of gameplay time I have to say LA Noire is one of the most ambitious, most interesting and most exciting games I have played in recent years. Attention to detail is top-notch as we have already gotten used to it when it comes to a Rockstar game. But here this is more commendable as this is now a "serious" game - you follow the story of detective Phelps, an LAPD cop, who rises from being a simple patrolman to working with the best and most influential cops in the force. You quickly realise that there are people harder to catch out there - you start with the small fish only to find clues as to how to grab the biggest sharks in town.\n\nGameplay-wise LA Noire is a bit different from GTA IV. The missions - or as they're referred to, cases - usually start out with a crime scene investigation. You get in a car and drive to your destination where you need to look for clues. Clues are objects you can interact with - once you approach one you'll hear a chime; this is how the game tells you that you can now press a button to grab the object in your vicinity. The more clues you find the more are added to your notebook. There is usually a witness around you can interview.\n\nAnd this is the 2nd most important thing in gameplay: interviewing means that while you can pick your questions from a list provided you also need to "evaluate" the suspects' responses. You have 3 options: you either believe what they are saying, you can remain in doubt or you can shout at them calling them liars. Picking the correct answer will make it easier for you to find and apprehend the real suspect. Make no mistake: if you are wrong it does not mean game over but it will affect the scoring at the end of your case.\n\nYou should also note two more things: firstly, you can have help in the form of intuition points. The more crimes you solve the more experience points you get. Once you level up you gain an intuition point. These can be used to remove one of the 3 possible answers thereby increasing your chances to 50%.  Secondly, once you accuse someone of lying you need to prove that. Phelps immediately turns the page in his notebook to the list of evidences. You need to pick the right evidence to succeed (that is, if you have found enough clues for that to appear in your list).\n\nInterestingly, some of these conversations can be the most exciting and rewarding parts of the game. Rockstar employed a special motion capture technique which makes all faces and expressions as realistic as possible. In fact, you can see the faces of real life actors and actresses - those of you watching a lot of TV series will easily be able to recognise some of these. This also means that voice acting is provided by the same people and it is of equally high quality. Suspects not telling the truth usually look away, move their mouths, grimace, scratch their head, loose their tie, etc.\n\nThe mechanics for the action scenes are similar to that of GTA IV. You have the same cover system, you can brawl occasionally and you have car chases where your partner does the shooting. You just need to make sure you are as close to the suspect's vehicle as possible so that your detective partner can shoot the tires. Sometimes, your job is to apprehend a suspect in a non-lethal way - if not by brawling then by running after and tackling him. These scenes can get very repetitive which I did not mind in particular - except some of them felt a little too scripted: I thought I could get a guy if I was quick only to realise he was meant to be stopped by an accident.\n\nAnother minor annoyance is the interview part: sometimes you are convinced the suspect is lying. You know you do not have any evidence so you pick the option "Doubt" but it turns out the guy was right so he was probably making a grimace due to being confused. As the game has an auto-save function you can easily quit and reload to try again but after a while this can be annoying. It just feels that Rockstar had a certain idea in mind for these choices and if you are lucky you can get the answer right.\n\nBut what is there beside the cases you work on? Does LA Noire offer you the option of free roaming? I am happy to say it does: dispatch informs you of ongoing crimes and you can leave your current case to pursue these. Also, there are TONS of items to look for: badges, famous landmarks, film reels and 95 (!) vehicles to get into. Once you get into a car it is "unlocked". Under "Extras" in the main menu you'll find a showroom to have a look at an already unlocked vehicle. Many look pretty similar but they can be different models - sometimes it feels a bit ridiculous to get in and out of every vehicle you find in a parking lot but there's no other way for you to find all of them. I have to admit I could only collect 90% of them.\n\nAs for the cases: you have everything you need. Narcotics, arsons, thefts, grand theft auto, cases with corrupt cops, serials killer, etc. The places you visit are varied and look realistic. Accompanying music and sound effects also represent an excellent quality.\n\nLA Noire has 21 cases. It feels as if you were watching a season of your favourite crime series. 21 episodes of it. And when it is over you are happy but at the same time you are eager to see what's coming in the next season. I wish LA Noire had one more season.","April 6, 2014","true","42.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When i play this game, i feel like i was a real detective. The motion capture technology makes the facial animation so smooth, but this is not the game that you can play on some 5-6 hours marathon because it can get a little repetitive sometimes. Also collecting newspapers and empty film canister also handling street crime is so much fun.\n\n9/10\nMust Buy","January 5","true","44.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Music, cars, scenery, clothing, you really get a feel for the time period. The start of each new chapter gives the feel of a new episode of a crime drama on TV. This is a good fit, as the game is quite a bit like an interactive movie.\n\nThe game controls are a bit like Bully (also from Rockstar). Grand Theft Auto controls would have been better, but the game plays perfectly fine with a controller.\n\nThe graphics are quite good. The latest and greatest lighting and textures may not be present, but the game does a great job with facial expressions. This is a good thing, as most of the game revolves around your ability as a detective to identify when someone is not telling the truth.\n\nGameplay has youin the role of a detective. You look for evidence, question suspects and in your "off time" run down street criminals as sort of little mini missions.\nThe evidence searches are quite easy if you set the controller to vibrate when they are nearby. Without the aid of vibration, it would be very easy to miss a clue without clicking every shred of paper you walk close to.\nSuspect interviews are a little tougher. You ask a question and get an answer. Then you have to  decide on facial expressions (shifting eyes, a smile, looking away...etc. if the suspect if not giving the full story, or if they are flatout lying. If you choose correctly, you are rewarded with more information and some points. Choose wrong, and you will fail to be promoted.\nThere are intuition points you earn that can help to find evidence and determine if someone is lying, but you can burn though these quickly and will need to solve more crimes to refill your suply.\n\nThere are fight scenes with guns and fists, and chase scenes in vehicles. If you fail these smaller missions several times in a row, the game shows you merry and allows skipping the mission without penalty.\n\nAs I said, the game is very much a story that you are taking part in. Gameplay is not very difficult, and while you can replay missions to do better, the story and cutscenes do not really make for interesting replay value.\n\nI'm enjoying the story, and am intrigued enough to keep going. Overall the game is good. I think the only downside is a low replay value.\nThere is some type of online social component to the game, but I've not been able to connect to it, The game is a few years old, so maybe the servers have been shutdown?\n","January 3","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really enjoyed the interrogation mechanics and the use of the motion capture technology for the actors faces to be realistically portrayed in the game was just awesome.\n\nthe game loses some steam right after the early sections, it becomes sort of repetitive and the action sequences (driving and shooting sections) are spaced out a little too far for a few hours of gameplay, but make it through this slower section and the game's story and action pick up and hook you into the experience hard enough to push through to the more exciting final chapters of the game.\n\nI experienced a few minor technical issues - mostly with the controls at certain sections of the game, navigating tighter spaces when looking for clues can be a bit clunky and the cover shooting mechanics felt very unpolished and I tended to avoid using the cover system because of that.\n\n9.5/10 experience overall. Had the pacing been a little better in the second act of the game, and the control issues not been there it could've been a 10/10. These two small issues didn't keep me from loving the game regardless though. Probably a top 10 game of all time for me.\n\nget it now","January 24","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whether you're into gameplay or the storytelling or even both you'll find something to love about this game. A story with many twist and turns, you can easily see the effort put into the writing. The gameplay is also really good. Couple the story with a huge virtual 1940's Los Angeles to explore for extra missions and hidden collectables.

The feel of, I'm guessing, 1950s LA is tremendous and is really remeniscent of LA Confidential, so I instantly loved this.\n\nThe voice acting is really well done indeed and I'm guessing the actors bodies were imaged for each character in this, so it's a big bravo on that.  The story is very impressive and it was excellent to see the main plot ticking over in the background whilst you're following a meandering path, which will eventually lead you to said plot.  The graphics and sound effects were excellent and joined with the innovative element of interrogation you have a winning formula that deserves to be a big fan favourite.  Also hats off to attention to detail with the vehicles.  They had no crumple zones and such in those days, as they were just girders on wheels and if you hit something you really hit it with a crunch.\n\nIf you don't have this then get it.\n\n9/10","September 25, 2015","true","49.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a body on the sidewalk, paramedics on scene, a few witnesses to question and clues to gather. This is bulk of the gameplay for L.A noire and it is done well. The game also has you interrogarting suspects, driving around town and even the odd car chase.\n\nWhat I enjoyed was trying to piece together evidence and testimonies. The graphics, while good are somewhat strange when it comes to facial expressions which is annoying when trying to read faces and decide what the next line of interrogation should be. But for the rest its all a solid game. Beautiful heavy ornate cars that handle like the tanks they were. Challenging but not frustrating difficulty. Nice, if slightly forgettable score. And above all a lengthly campaign that doesn't feel repetitive or boring\n\nI recommend this!

Everything.\n\nL.A. Noire is all about amazing you with its crisp gameplay, groundbreaking facial capture technology (at the time), and great atmosphere and setting.\nSet in 1946 Los Angeles, the second world war has come to a close and living soldiers have to make a living somehow. Cole Phelps decides to go into law enforcement, and the story ramps up from there, no spoilers at all from me, you just have to trust me. I bought this game on my xbox360, ps3, and now my tablet, (surface 3), and the game still manages to feel new to me.\n\nThe controls on PC are great, I love the default control, but you can easily adjust and edit those controls in the options. You can use any game controller as well. One thing for tablets though, using the right click if you have no mouse gets troublesome pretty fast, but for desktop users it is fluid, no doubt.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, but the game is capped at 30FPS (I believe) and that might bug people, but you can always tinker with the graphics in  game anytime. ANYTIME. No more launcher people!\n\nFacial capture technology is what really shines here though, as it displays the emotions and "tells", (which you need for interrogations and questioning people at the crime scene). perfectly.\n\nThe gameplay is fun if you like puzzle games, third person games, story rich games, or even just noire like games. The feeling and atmosphere as stated above is just incredible. Just incredible! It has...\n. Puzzle solving and deducing\n. Gunplay\n. Car chases and on foot chases\n. Hand to Hand combat\n. Tough decision making\n. Driving\nand more.\n\nThe length of this game is also fantastic, though near the end, I began to lose track of the story as I didn't like something that happens. I won't spoil it completely, but you'll know what I mean. Why was that necessary? Stick with the ideas you had. Not to mention, I didn't entirely get the ending, it is a bit underwhelming, and very unexpected.\n\nAll in all though, this game is definitely worth a buy, even more if you can pick it up on sale.\nHere's to hoping for L.A. Noire 2 folks :)\nGet Cole Phelp'd","January 3","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's more of a cerebral game than an action packed one (though there is some action).  The game does kind of drag on at parts, and as such, I highly recommend skipping all the random street crimes, and just having your partner drive you everywhere (by holding down the enter vehicle button until you tell your partner to drive).  The street crimes don't add much to the game unless you're a staunch completionist.  The game is broken up into distinct chapters, and so it is easy to sit down and play it in hour long chunks, which might be nice for some people.\n\nYou can probably get 30ish hours out of this game, but as I said, the game does definitely drag on at points.  I'd recommend it if you see it on sale, but maybe not for full price.  It's a fun game overall, but suffers from the pacing.","June 29, 2014","true","33.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I personally give it a 10/10. Because it has a fantastic story that is unparalleled even in today's movies and books. The game play is amazing, and to be honest im gonna leave it towards other people to go on about that. I just wanted to put my peice out there saying that this game is worth your money.\n\nBut also because i wanted to end all the claims of how bad a port it really is. Yes it is not the best port, but compared to  GTA IV and its GFWL port, it's pretty damn good. People saying 30fps is a con are just wrong, flat out wrong. People need to put it under a plus. 30fps is so smooth in this game, because the engine was NOT designed for 60fps. I myself have played about half an hour at an uncapped 60fps and i couldn't go on any longer, while yes it looks smooth as ♥♥♥♥, the driving is horrible, like driving on a ice skating rink and the brakes don't work, and the facial animations look worse, they look really stupid and to quote the infamous console peasant cry "60fps is too fast", it is only applicable to L.A. Noire.\n\nTo fix the framerate though because it does have trouble keeping a solid 30fps. Copy and paste this in your command line in the launch options.\n\n-npd -str -nonv\n\nIt works for most people, including me.","March 2, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Noire because I enjoyed the story and I found each case to be compelling.  The way it weaved the past into current events and tied things together by the end was legendary.  The way the devs captured the actor's facial expressions, while treading into the uncanny valley big-time, gave this game an amazing quality.  Driving through old time Los Angeles was a lot of fun.  I think this is a game most people will enjoy.\n\nAll that being said sometimes when characters talk their mouths look really wrong.  It looks like the mesh is the wrong shape for the expression ( usually noticable with yelling and other large mouth shapes).  While historically accurate all the cars look way too much alike to necessate the diversity in this game (especially with the frustrating achievement attached to driving them all).  Getting in and out of cars takes flippin' forever.  Special cars that boast a max speed of 140 MPH even at full throtle the game says your max speed even was around 86 MPH.\n\nThe main gameplay element of interrigation is frustrating as they purposefully designed it to not allow you to restart a bad interrigation over without quitting and reloading your last save.  Sure, it opens other opportunities to play through the mission based on failure to catch the person in a lie but that wasn't what I was playing this for.\n\nStory gripes ahead, Spoilers: The love interest in this game looks like a dirty bag of melted action figures so when Cole started persuing her romatically I didn't buy it for a second.  You are a war hero get a woman that is worth the trouble. The ending was purposefully unsatisfying but come on give a guy some hope that Cole's work wasn't for nothing.","September 20, 2014","true","54.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Music, cars, scenery, clothing, you really get a feel for the time period. The start of each new chapter gives the feel of a new episode of a crime drama on TV. This is a good fit, as the game is quite a bit like an interactive movie.\n\nThe game controls are a bit like Bully (also from Rockstar). Grand Theft Auto controls would have been better, but the game plays perfectly fine with a controller.\n\nThe graphics are quite good. The latest and greatest lighting and textures may not be present, but the game does a great job with facial expressions. This is a good thing, as most of the game revolves around your ability as a detective to identify when someone is not telling the truth.\n\nGameplay has youin the role of a detective. You look for evidence, question suspects and in your "off time" run down street criminals as sort of little mini missions.\nThe evidence searches are quite easy if you set the controller to vibrate when they are nearby. Without the aid of vibration, it would be very easy to miss a clue without clicking every shred of paper you walk close to.\nSuspect interviews are a little tougher. You ask a question and get an answer. Then you have to  decide on facial expressions (shifting eyes, a smile, looking away...etc. if the suspect if not giving the full story, or if they are flatout lying. If you choose correctly, you are rewarded with more information and some points. Choose wrong, and you will fail to be promoted.\nThere are intuition points you earn that can help to find evidence and determine if someone is lying, but you can burn though these quickly and will need to solve more crimes to refill your suply.\n\nThere are fight scenes with guns and fists, and chase scenes in vehicles. If you fail these smaller missions several times in a row, the game shows you merry and allows skipping the mission without penalty.\n\nAs I said, the game is very much a story that you are taking part in. Gameplay is not very difficult, and while you can replay missions to do better, the story and cutscenes do not really make for interesting replay value.\n\nI'm enjoying the story, and am intrigued enough to keep going. Overall the game is good. I think the only downside is a low replay value.\nThere is some type of online social component to the game, but I've not been able to connect to it, The game is a few years old, so maybe the servers have been shutdown?\n","January 3","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Quite an incredible game.\n\nPros:\n-By far the best facial epxressions I've ever seen in a game, which is good because they play a very key part in interrigations.\n-Once you learn the classic tells of a liar, interrigations become much more fluid, and less rage inducing.\n-A very immersive and a great portayal of a 40's detective.\n-Great music & ambience.\n\nCons:\n-A tad bit long, I have played this game off and on over the years and only just now beat it.\n-Not a very good port. The game works but unfortunately there are FPS issues, and not just because it is locked to 30 (often drops to 24, but I found that if it happens, just go to graphics settings, change 1 setting, hit apply, and then it's back to 30-repeat as necessary).\n-Probably best to play this on a console-although if you get this on steam I strongly recommend switching to PC controls for firefights, and using controller for everything else.","January 9","true","64.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bulck/recommended/110800/","bulck","Buick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bulck/","72 products in account","Most games compete in certain brackets and standarts, so their flaws and advantages are defined compared to those that are similar. That means that games which don't fit into those regulations should be judged differently. L.A. Noire, no matter what anybody says, is truly a unique and unrivaled experience, unlike anything you've ever played before. In that light, it deserves any player's attention and respect. It has its flaws, but those are heavily outweighed by the game's positive sides.\n\nSince the pros are a lot more significant than the cons, lets start with the drawbacks.\nCons:\n-"Fake" Open world. In the beginning of the story, the player is thrown into an immensely large world of the late 40's LA. Its level of detail and magnitude are on par with those of the GTA Series. The world is HUGE. But I couldn't help but feel like a prisoner in the middle of a desert. With such freedom, there should be a lot of thing to do, right? And that's where LA Noire struggles. Frankly, there's almost nothing to do other than the campaign. The Street Crimes, although elaborate, are extremely repetitive: all consist of drive to the scene, then catch this guy/shoot them/trail the bandit. No real variety there. Other than that, the Landmarks, although crucial for certain cases, are uninteresting; the same story is with the movie reels. The game world is only saved by the outstanding atmosphere and the overall great representation of the 40's LA: it is simply entertaining to just drive around, pay attention to details and feel the history in your hands.\n-Repetitiveness. Though it is clear Team Bondi tried to include as much variety as possible(neither street crimes nor main cases are exactly the same), the true nature of the game is very plain and monotonous. In some cases, especially the homicide desk, the gameplay comes down to "go to scene, inspect, go there, interrogate, go there, done." At that point in the game, it is repetitive, boring, and disappointing. It has to be said though, it may be a good thing. I have never worked as a detective and cannot judge whether that's just realism; maybe so.\n-The ending. Objectively, it might not be bad. But it does not fit any of the criteria for a good, satisfying ending: it doesn't connect with the major plot lines and characters, it doesn't intrigue or send a great message, it doesn't fit the style of the story itself. Some say that it fits the "Noir" genre and can only be understood by "mature audience", don't really understand what "noir" means. At least LA Noire puts an end to the story, unlike some other games where the ending is DLC'd.\n\nNow onto the good parts,\nPros:\n-AMAZING immersion and atmosphere. Truly incredible to play a game where the player feels so related to Phelps and others. There are only several titles I can name which come close in atmosphere to the perfectly replicated post-war Los Angeles of LA Noire. Everything feels realistic, smooth, and satisfying. The city of LA is alive and full of cool landmarks and details to explore. Some characters are relatable and felt for, some are disgustingly unpleasant. When major plot lines come up, the emotional response to the fate of the story and characters is deep and real.\n-Uniqueness. LA Noire is truly one of a kind game. Noir style is objectively interesting, detectives are appealing to some people. In gaming those two styles aren't seen often; in fact, a simple google search for both yields the fact that this game is exceptional. No other game provides such feel of responsibility for your actions and requirement for logic and attention to detail. The face-capture technology also allows interrogations to reach a new level. All interactions with suspects and your notebook are something completely new and very interesting.\n-Vice and DLC cases. To put it plainly, none of the cons apply to the Vice desk and most DLC cases. Both are a undoubtfully a 10/10 experience. Early on Ad Vice, the player learns true responsibilty for actions as minor characters may actually die depending on the success or failure of the detective. As other desks cases can get tidious, Vice provides an outstanding variety of settings, actions, locations, and colorful characters, connected by an highly entertaining and unexpected plot details and twists. As for DLC cases, they are the same way - incredibly fun and interactive. 5 awesome cases - a great value for 1$, no doubt. The last one is a real visual treat as well.\n-Face capture technology. Something new and fresh. A real improvement to the industry introduced in a game which really needs it the most. The game and the characters feel much more alive and responsive than even before, which provides for a true detective experience.\n\nIn conclusion, LA Noire is entertaining but inconsistent. Some parts of the game are a masterpiece, some are an unfortunate failure. Overall, definetly worth trying out for both fans of Noir/Detective and non-fans. 7.5/10","January 4","true","25.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Noire is a game with a lot of backstory in development and otherwise. All you really need to know is that on PC the game has been tremendously upgraded in the visuals. 4K native and 4xSGSSAA make a completely different experience to the PS3 version. This cannot be overstated.\n\nOtherwise, we don't have the upgraded audio from PS3 but basically everything else in one cheap package. Going back to the PS3 version on the DS3 pad is exponentially worse than something like a DS4 and Input Mapper. These two major changes make the PS3 version all but unplayable in retrospect.\n\nFor the game, of course, we have old L.A. modelled with exquisite outer detail. The indoor locations are lacking outside of the story mode, and there isn't a lot to do in the city overall. However, if you just take this for what it is the game shines for the time you play it. The Lie-Doubt-Truth mechanic is average, but you can still have fun with the game despite its flaws because being in 1940s L.A. is just honestly kind of fun. The audio is top notch work for the most part. Animations in the faces hold up because of the work they put into it, though, that does hamper the port at aonly 30FPS.\n\nTravelling by cars is pretty fun, and also finding all the different makes and models is actually very cool now that the graphics have proper AA and detail. Most of what you get out of this game depends on if you like the setting. The stories and characters are for sure a cut above the average crowd, and some of them are very well done. But it comes back down to if you like this period and if you have the PC to play it right. An OC'd 970 and 2500K should do the job.\n\nSo it's worth it just to see the detail of the city and the 1940s. The artists here pull it all off with great abandon. So much detail was drawn into this city, and yes it is a shame there is not more to do. Sometimes development hell gets the best of you. Still, the stories are interesting enough and the locations all now look so much more lovely than they ever did. Travel around and chill out with L.A. Noire and you'll have a fun time.","January 26","true","19.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not just because it’s not the classic “runny gunny” variant of Rockstar games, but mostly because I have solved 4 or 5 cases and it feels like I haven’t really done much. I’ve unlocked outfits that look like repaints of the same basic thing (Watch_Dogs would later come to have the same exact problem), and I seem to be unlocking intuition points I don’t really need since I can just Shift+Tab to a guide that tells me when people are lieing.\n\nI don’t want to sound like a mouthbreather who can’t handle not having violence in my face every ten minutes. But after 3 hours and two gunfights, I feel there should be a /little/ more peppered around.\nMy very first case I failed immediately when the perp ran away. I went to fire at him, just once, and actually managed to hit him in the leg. Instant “You failed” screen, “Man got injured” it said. No kidding? He was fleeing.\n\nSo I find a street crime a little later, THINKING I shouldn’t be shooting the masked perp with a firing gun. Since I couldn’t figure out how to melee with my gun drawn, I just tried rushing him. Mission failed. “Officer down” it says.\nChrist, make up your mind.\n\nAnother street crime was a more clearcut gunfight, which was enjoyable but the game CLEARLY didn’t emphasize the gunplay. The controls were a bit sluggish as my dude slowly gets out of cover and slowly figures out that I’m holding the shift button to sprint to a different piece of cover. I haven’t died yet, but I have taken a few shots because Cole won’t move his friggn’ ♥♥♥.\n\nI will admit, first impressions were pretty decent. They’ve taken a slight (but only slight) dip due to the clunky movement. I also don’t feel like an “open ended” game is the right platform for the investigative style it’s going for. Indeed, it’s hardly open ended at all. I can’t really “stop” any investigation and wander. Sometimes my police car gets a call that I can generally divert and deal with, but there’s no ‘wandering’ available. I’m wondering why the world is this large when all I can do is “Investigation” and “shoot some Mexicans over here”. Even clothing is changed via the menu, no shopping to be done.\nIs a more open world “unlocked” later? Rockstar is sometimes fond of that. If so, that’s fair. I’ll keep playing it (though mostly in one-hour chunks so my computer doesn’t explode).","September 18, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game efficiently blends story within story (past and present), via chapters that seamlessly blend together, efficiently creating a believable narration of one mans journey though a troubled time, and a troubled country. The game boasts amazing facial animation techniques, thus creating a greater range of viable facial contortions for the actors to express. The authenticity of the time is expressed in great detail as shown with the vehicle designs, the setting of the city, the music, and the people. The game boasts an extremely interactive environment in the form of interrogations, crime solving, clue searching (all being core aspects of gameplay), and in a most realistic way. Vehicular chases of any sort are exhilarating and finely executed (as well as the pedestrian chases), although general movement is a tad clunky, and unfortunately the combat mechanics are relatively mediocre, if fluent and stable. In conclusion: L.A Noire is well worth your time and your money, and is a must have for any fan of the mystery/thriller genre.","July 5, 2013","true","32.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Have actually really enjoyed LA Noire. The stories and characters are very believable - very maturely presented - and the facial animation is absolutely outstanding. There is a tendency for the formulaic which is fairly unavoidable with most games of this nature (drive here, find clues, interview her, next location, gun battle, etc). However I've been kept engaged both with interest in the story and the general challenge level of the game.\n\nOf particular note I've found the loving recreation of 1940's Los Angeles most intriguing. The sense of place and time is absolutely outstanding and well worth the investment. For achievement hunters, the achievements are reasonably constant and offer a good challenge with a handful that only the most dedicated will reach.\n\nRecommend it.","June 25, 2014","true","51.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I love the period setting (40's, post war), the motion capture (using MotionScan) of facial expressions, the cars, the story...it all worked for me.\nA brief mention of a technical detail is necessary however.  The game is capped at 30 FPS and this can result in some performance degradation.  You'll read numerous complaints about it being a console port and that it's unplayable.  True it is a port, but unplayable?  That is completely unfounded.\n\nNow that we've gotten that out of the way...\n\nIf you're a fan of film noir and the crime thrillers of yore, you will enjoy this game.  It is not even necessary for you to be particularly good at gaming to complete a play through.  While there is action woven into the cases, most of the time you're putting the pieces together or interviewing suspects.  Some cases had me stumped at times, but I found that all the more encouraging to examine the evidence, make connections and solve it.\nMy recommendation to anyone considering playing this game, don't be tempted to find a walkthrough to breeze through the cases on auto-pilot.  Give them an honest try and use what's given to you. Games have boundaries so use that to your advantage to make your deductions.  You won't regret it and when you get that 5 star rating at the close of the case, you'll start believing you're ready to join local law enforcement (I jest).\nI have to emphasize the MotionScan technology used to capture facial expressions.  This was a necessary and very impressive component to the game.  While interviewing suspects you have to examine their facial expressions and behavior to determine if they are lying or telling the truth.  It is impressive...I don't think enough people give the studio credit for this achievement.\n\nStory wise, I was intrigued by the fact that the story emphasized the impact of WW2.  I don't want to talk about the story too much as to give anything away. The actors casted for the characters were believable and well played.  I started looking them up on IMDB to see where I recognized them from.  In some ways it made me long for the days of FMV in the late 90's but I really loved the style and animation as it stood.  I read that in a potential sequel (not a direct sequel) to LA Noire, they may be working on doing full body motion capture with the MotionScan technology rather than just facial expressions.\n\nTo further highlight how much I enjoyed this game, I even embarked upon completing the achievements and gophering around collecting all of the cars and film reels.\n\nDo yourself a favor, give this one a run.\n\n","September 20, 2014","true","73.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It stands between Tomb Raider, GTA and Sherlock Holmes adventures. You are not gonna shoot everybody you meet and you are not gonna have an opportunity to do that.

By "simplistic mechanics" I'm referring to the GTA style driving- and shooting-mechanics.\n\nAside from that, the meat of the game is in detecting people's reactions to your pointed questions. The ability to see a doctor put his hands behind his back and suck on his lower lip as a telegraph that he isn't telling the truth is something that is very difficult to pick up at first but once you get the hang of it you start to really appreciate the development work that went into making it more about sussing out liars and cheaters than about reaction time and purchased upgrades. This game comes highly recommended also because of the way it draws you into post-WW2 Los Angeles: a city that is exploding with the popularity of movies and the pursuit of the american dream.\n\nThe connecting narrative involving the eventual conspiracy scenario really didn't do too well to provide a driving force from case to case. The villains in the game seem very static and aren't fleshed out too well. As a result, actually finishing the game took some determination because you really don't care by the end.\n\nThat being said, I highly recommend playing this game which is now super-cheap in 2014. There are quite a few memorable experiences in it and the concept and execution of the atmosphere is well-worth it.","June 28, 2014","true","69.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game efficiently blends story within story (past and present), via chapters that seamlessly blend together, efficiently creating a believable narration of one mans journey though a troubled time, and a troubled country. The game boasts amazing facial animation techniques, thus creating a greater range of viable facial contortions for the actors to express. The authenticity of the time is expressed in great detail as shown with the vehicle designs, the setting of the city, the music, and the people. The game boasts an extremely interactive environment in the form of interrogations, crime solving, clue searching (all being core aspects of gameplay), and in a most realistic way. Vehicular chases of any sort are exhilarating and finely executed (as well as the pedestrian chases), although general movement is a tad clunky, and unfortunately the combat mechanics are relatively mediocre, if fluent and stable.

Noire is something like Mafia but they are wrong. Those games have common only the age of story maybe. The biggest difference is in the adventure part of L.A. Noire, you'll have to find evidences and to speak with suspect people mostly in the gameplay. Though shootouts aren't frequent (just in optional missions and at the end of the game) and if you get to some they are boring, the investigations of cases are seriously funny and the system of dialogs is great. You have to decide, if suspect person says truth or lies at the moment. If you choose a lie, you must prove your contention by the appropriate evidence that you have found. You can make a pressure per person as well, if you are not sure. The storyline is higher than average and the surroudings of the City of Angels is very nice. I recommend to buy DLC's as well, there are the best cases in my opinion.","December 27, 2013","true","31.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

We see him throughout the game being torn down by his own past , we no longer see him cling to the ivory tower of hypocrisy we saw him in, in the beginning of the game. Playing as Jack Kelso at the end is supposed to make us feel like we made a mistake judging Phelps too early because Kelso is a character who is way too nice and lets others trample over him just so he can call himself an honorary man who lives for a higher purpose. But after the ending, you realize that Phelps was right to abandon his fortune for his passion, that there is no higher purpose but to live with what you want out of life and to chase what you want with reckless abandon. His mistake was joining the marines with this mentality and getting most of his men killed in battle and many more civilians killed. In the end, Elsa healed Cole but when let his guard down, he got the retribution he deserved not for commiting adultery but commiting an act of hubris that led to a long and winding path of death and misery. If you think about it this way, Cole was the suspect the whole time, becasue his warcrimes led to most of the game's murder cases.","December 26, 2015","true","25.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

That game is L.A. Noire.\n\nLets look at the Pros, Mixed, and Cons.\n\n+ Very fun gameplay. I want to let you know that this game IS a puzzle game, but not as you might expect. You have to find certain clues, not doing any stupid pushing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's very fun and addictive, and wants me to have more of it. Also, there is some shooting and driving involved. However, if you wanted this to be a GTA in 1940, then you will be disappointed. However, you should love it, even if puzzles are not your thing.\n\n+ The Sound if FANTASTIC. If I had to rate this game on Sound, it would be a 10.5/10. It's that DAMN GOOD. The soundtrack is great and so 1940s! In fact, I noticed a lot of music from Fallout 3 in here, which also has awesome music. The voice acting is also perfect. It sounded like it could have been real detectives.\n\n+ The graphics are pretty dang sweet. The character models, especially their faces, are great. I never noticed bad lip-syncing, unlike most other games. I know there is one issue invloving graphics, but I will later address that in the review.\n\n+ A long story. It took me around 24 hours to beat L.A. Noire, and I was not rushing. It's fantastic well it lasts. However, well it lasts.\n\n+ Side Missions. They are not that good, but not bad either. It is nice that they added this, so this will not go against the review.\n\nMixed:\n- 30 FPS capped. This would be a huge con IF it were not for a damn good explanation. So, this game was originally a console game, just like Red Dead Redemption (By the way rockstar, add it onto Steam. I don't care that it's almost 5 years old, I really want to play it) As we know, a lot of console games are locked at 30 FPS (Destiny, Fallout 4, etc.) However, Rockstar noticed there was a huge problem. The lip-syncing on PC was not good at all. They had a total of 4 choices: 1. Let there be bad lip-syncing, removing points from the PC review. 2. Redo THE ENTIRE GAME FOR PC, which could have taken a long time. 3. Make the gameplay 60 FPS, but the faces 30 FPS, possibly making bad lag, as well as confusing most people. 4. Keep it the same, but face there will be only be regular players who will outrage. I think 4 was the safest bet, plus it does not run that bad. At 30 FPS, it is fantastic. However, I still wish there was at least an option.\n\nCons:\n- The gameplay gets boring a bit fast. After the 30th time of having a shoot out, it gets tiring. However, only the shooting. The interviews and car driving never get old.\n\n- This game has glitches, which might not seem bad, until I tell you. Screen-tearing, graphical glitches, and more are only uncommon, not rare.\n\n- Very little replay value. There is no second route, like GTA, Fallout, or Elder Scrolls. The next time you play it, it will be the same, which makes it boring. However, there is DLC if you can not get enough, which you would have to be crazy to not be.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n\n9/10\nL.A. Noire is a fantastic game.\nAt full price it is worth it. On sale, you would have to be crazy not to buy it. I love this game and am praying that Rockstar will make a sequel, improving the games flaws.\n\n","December 12, 2015","true","24.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Noire is an investigative game in which you are brought to solve many interesting cases as a L.A.P.D. detective.\nThe cases are varied and amazingly well written, ranging from Traffic cases, to Arson cases, ending with Homicide and Vice.\nFrom time to time, while you solve these cases, you have to perform other tasks like shootouts or car chases ecc...so the game keeps things interesting for the player.\nThe best feature of the game is the connection you enstablish with the main character.\nIt's not just a linear progression of cases to solve, but you actually follow the intriguing story of the main character Cole Phelps, and all the cases are all connected into a hidden understory which is very engaging.\nThe topics that are dealt with are different, but the atmosphere reminds of L.A. Confidential.\nThe overall graphics are pretty good and the game features a groundbraking facial animation technology which feels strange at first, but then delivers some of the most realistic facial expressions seen in a game, and the best thing is that they are not just for show, they are very important for the gameplay, since you have to check suspects facial expressions (even the smallest details) during interrogations, to spot if they are lying or not.\nThe Los Angeles reconstruction is incredible; the city is ENORMOUS! It almost feels life-size.\nThe player is immersed in a very realistic and detailed representation of the most glamorous city in the world (L.A.), in its prime time (the 1940s, after the war).\nA great experience, and if you are a patient player you'll be rewarded with one of the best games available on the market.\n\nPros:\n- The Main Character, which is more multi-layered and constructed than it might look at the beginning\n- Amazing cases; the developers had great ideas for every case, and you feel engaged to discover the truth\n- Varied experience (The case-solving is alternated with other activities)\n- Brilliant interrogations system (you need to take care of the clues and the interrogated person's facial expressions)\n- L.A. is detailed and beautiful\n- Engaging story, linking all the cases togheter\n- Long game\n\nCons:\n- There's a bit of aliasing, even if you activate antialiasing\n- Needs a patient player to be appreciated and completed (Not a negative point, but it's just to let you know)\n- The city is BIG...maybe too big, and some driving phases are a bit boring\n\nRecommended!","August 15, 2014","true","36.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a movie, it's a novel, it's a TV-serie, it's a puzzle, it's a tragedy, it's a fiction, it's the truth.\nPlaying a sandbox game as a good policeman is something you will get use to easily.\nIn the beginning you probably will find the game hard to play and have success in; but when you get into it, you will wonder the finale as much as you will wish that it won't end.\n\n\nBuy it if your rig is enough.*  You don't need to wait for Steam Sales to come.\n\n\n* LA Noire has average optimisation. It uses constant 30 FPS because of its technology. When/if you get 25- FPS, it may hurt your eyes.

The technology used on the faces is almost in an uncanny valley kinda of thing, but it's still very enjoyable.\nAs a detective in a 1947 L.A., that is pretty detailing and very accurate picture of the city in the past, you're suppose to discover the truth, see behind the lies of the all the suspects and find the one truth. And you gotta do that not just by using evidence, à la Ace Attorney, but also by reading the physiology of the person in front of you (well, it's more the face, and their expression but you get the point).\nAnyway, is a good game and with an awesome scenario and very interesting features.

But they are some problems with lag with people whos PCs are more than perfect to play on but has a bad PC port but if you have a good PC, like me, than trust me this will be worth your money just for the story and interrogations alone.","October 19, 2014","true","33.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I don't finish many single-player games as I am easily bored, but I finished this one.  The storey keeps you hooked.  It's well worth the cheap price you can get it for these days.

The city looks nice, but it is largely just for show (you can't interact with much).  The facial motion-capture and acting is the best I have ever seen in a game.

Quite frustrating and difficult to get used to.\n\nThe investigation mechanics are the only thing the game really has going for it, and they are great, but I can't help have the feeling that the game would have been a LOT stronger overall if it focused more on that side of things than on crappy gunplay and drawn out driving sequences.\n\nProbably the most irritating thing is that cut scenes are unskippable...So if you restart a case, you have to sit through all of the dialogue, then drive back to the crime scene etc....This is bad in any game, but in a game that relies heavily on story exposition it is pretty unforgivable.\n\nIt does have an interesting story as well. Probably worth picking up in a sale if you are interested in the premise, but don't expect an action game, or rewarding gunplay, or enjoyable driving experiences.","December 22, 2013","true","3.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

My guy blows his top and calls the witnesses liars, and the game tells me I failed to choose correctly. So I restart the case many times. Finally I chose that the witness is telling the Truth. My guy calmly tells the witness he is lyeing, and the witness confesses and gives more evidence. Game tells me I chose correctly this time. WTF!?!?! This is bull****!!! The two answers are backwards, but are scripted as if it were correct.\n\nThis kept happening during this certain case, and I have to wonder if the rest of the cases are also scripted to mess with the player instead of acting correctly. Its so frustrating to be told you are wrong when you were correct, and slapped on the wrist for it, until you answer incorrectly and are rewarded for it.\n\nThe fun parts though are the action scenes if you are driving a squad car. You stop for a bank robbery and kill all the bank robbers in 40 seconds. Then you wish there were 10 more bank robbers so you felt it was a challenge. Most of the time there seemed to be 4 bank robbers, but then there were 5 or 6 the last time, so I hope that my level increases the difficulty of the action scenes.\n\nOn the downfall, most of the action scenes are incredibly easy. I assume its because I learned the controls really well, but I hope they get incredibly difficult.\n\nThe worst part was running the case again forces you to re-live the entire storyline times X. There is no scene skipping, EVER! I looked on the RockStar page and someone asked for a kb key to press to skip scenes and they said backspace, and this was also shown in the control options. But backspace does not work! So... replay 25 minutes of scene footage to get to the part where you ask 3 questions to a witness again. Aaarrgghh!! Now this is frustrating.\n\nI wish it told me what I was going to say before I chose an option. Like:\nTruth: I bet you know more than you are letting on.\nDoubt: You know you are lieing, tell me the truth!\nLie: You're lieing! I have proof you did it in the lounge with the candlestick!\nbut... it doesn't. You have to play 25 minutes to see what you are going to say during a questioning.\n\nCons:Citizens look too much alike. I question one citizen, and in the next case there is another citizen who looks exactly like the previous citizen. I don't get it... in a small town, or a big city, all main characters should look unique. At least change their clothes and their hair.\nBackwards choices.\nCatching bad guys not involved in your case does not lead to opening new cases against them.\nUnlock cars by stealing them. Can't buy them.\nNo money system. Except for some sort of city damages that doesn't seem to affect you.\nEasy action missions.\nCan't skip scenes.\nCan't skip chatting.\nNo reason to explore the world if its not involved in your own mission.\nCan't use your gun, unless the game makes you take it out. And its not wise to use your gun even when the game forces you to take it out.\nCan't pull your fists out, unless the game makes you.\nYour guy yells at people on his own. You aren't controlling him. Its a movie, not a game.\nMini-map does not rotate. No options for the mini-map.\nLarge map takes 2 seconds to load, and 3 clicks to get back to game, which is 8 seconds. This is frustrating since there is no GPS. You are likely to drive into a long tunnel, instead of going towards your destination.\nAs you play, you realize there is less and less of a reason to explore anything unless it is literally handed to you. (Marked for inspection at the scene by a previous officer.) (Look for shining objects, cause if its not shining then its not ever important.)\nMany items to inspect are blocked by other items to inspect, making it hard to inspect even if you know that it is there to inspect. a missing flag on an argentinian ambassador's car is blocked by a missing license plate. This type of clue blocking happens in many cases.\nCan't look at your watch in game.\nCan't tell what date it is. But many records of the date when someone signed something.Pros:Feeling you are smart when you catch someone in a lie. (If the game feels like being truthful.)\nOpen world.\nEnvironment feels real, where there are loads of things to look at, but seldom does anything belong to the case you are working on. You get used to this, and stop looking at things that don't belong to any case ever.\nGame is set before finger printing, and everyone grabs a gun and fingers the crap out of it no matter what.\nGame shows how a police officer can walk right into anyone's house if they are invited inside for a different reason, then beat up the citizen and search his house for any reason what-so-ever. No need for warrants when police are invited inside.\n70+ cars to unlock.\nFun (but easy) action missions.\nNo GPS guidance, because you are in the 1940's.tl;dr\nAll in all... I feel to answer what you want to answer, you need a walk-through. But this goes against playing the game and sleuthing! Why not just watch a youtube video of this game instead?\n\nIf the game had a second tutorial on how to think like the developers thought that investigators should interogate citizens, then this game could have been a ton of fun and a shining star. Otherwise, you are left with writers trying to outsmart a player through cheap tricks.\nAnd by tricks I mean: thinking you Doubt someone, so you say Truth so that you "Doubt".","February 22, 2015","false","33.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Everything is functional and works fine.  It plays well.  The problems for me are twofold: other games have done all of the elements better, and context.\n\nRunning is fine, shooting is fine, the sound effects are fine, driving is fine, the open world is fine, interrogations are fine, investigations are fine.  There's nothing particularly wrong with any element and like I said the game is functional.  It works.  It's just that so many other games do everything better.  Pretty much any sandbox -- though most notably GTA -- does almost all of the elements better just because of context alone: it makes sense when you're in a huge gunfight or you're firing randomly at people, or driving like a maniac down the road.  Or, you know, stealing a ♥♥♥♥ing car.  I'm not saying that these events never happen if you're a police officer but I have to scratch my head at the ideas of it.\n\nInterrogations are fine.  They're ok.  They're acceptable.  However, any game in the Turnabout Courtroom series does the interrogation model so much better.  I never thought I would miss saving between interrogations because of life totals, but holy ♥♥♥♥ I do now.  This one and done ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is just aggrivating, especially when the answers are so vague at times (Hi, I'm showing you a blood stained weapon found in your car, in relation to a question about blood all over your car.  Why is this deemed wrong?  And now I'm out of the interrogation).  I get that you can ♥♥♥♥ the interrogations up and your progress isn't stalled but it is frustrating to have so many options before you and see that several could work.  At  least in Turnabout courtroom I'm just slightly perplexed when one of them is wrong, because you know what?  I can keep going and try again.\n\nThe open world makes no sense to me.  I don't understand why it was necessary for this game, as a large part of it is just driving from one point to another for story missions.  Sure, on occassion a crime pops up, but you have to accept that as your new mission anyway.  It's not like you drive by and one is going on, and you can take care of it or ignore it.  There's no organic feel whatsoever.\n\nLA Noire does create a very wonderful world that I enjoyed to drive around, it's just that it was hollow.  You know, like the rest of the game.\n\nIt took me a few weeks of not playing to decide but I came to the conclusion that I did not want to finish this game.  I'd seen enough of it and felt that, after 6 or so hours, it would just be more of the same.  I'm open to being wrong, and maybe I'll open it up again later and change my mind, but for now I'd rather just play another game.  One that's actually fun and not aggrivating.","September 14, 2014","false","5.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Playing as Coles Phelps you investigate homicides, thefts, drug trafficking and fraud, identifying crime scene clues and speaking to witnesses to gather evidence.\n+ A really nice feature of this game is the facial expressions used by characters. A lot of effort was put into this by the developers. After carefully observing how a person of interest behaves or talks, you can doubt what they are saying, judge whether they are lying, or believe them. If you're successful, you'll squeeze more information out of them leading to additional avenues in the case. This is good because it rewards the player for engaging in the game and playing it properly.\n+ Nice shootouts with several different types of weapons, although confrontations aren't that frequent. Use tommy guns, pistols or shotguns to take down foes. There's 40 street crimes to complete separate from cases.\n+ An intriguing storyline of crime, love and flashbacks of Cole Phelps life in the Marines during World War II. The ending is one you won't really expect. Really enjoyed it.\n+ Around 40-50 hours of gameplay with all DLC, trying to do your best on every case.\n+ Graphics are decent.\n\n\nNegatives:\n\n- The graphical quality of the game world could be improved. As it stands it still looks fine, but stunning visuals really do add to immersion.\n\nOverall Score: 9/10\n\nIt's hard to fault L.A Noire. This game kept me entertained and had lots of playtime available, the DLC adds some epic firefights and the story was great.

Now incase your thinking " Wow, Im going have to be a bug-searcher for the clues? ".

It is a cinematic game akin to Mafia 2 which was an incredible experience.  The fault of this game is the confusing interrogation of the suspects and witnesses.  The whole lie/truth/neutral stance really makes no sense to me whatsoever because whatever I click, Cole's response is never what I expect him to say.  If I knew what he was going to say before I click it would feel so much better and probably give me more correct run throughs.  I also failed to pay attention to some of the characters from the larger story arc but that's my fault so the story campaign was a little confusing.\n\nOn the bright side, the shooting and fight mechanics are awesome.  Driving around LA is great fun.  The world looks and sounds brilliant though it does run a little slow on my computer.  The dialogue and character interactions are top notch with excellent voice acting.  The facial expressions are a shining highlight and it makes those interrogations special even if I don't choose the correct option.\n\nDon't get too wrapped up in the interrogations, maybe it's all my fault, but the rest of the game is good enough, especially for 5 bucks on sale.","June 27, 2014","true","12.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I myself enjoy all three of these elements, and so find this game incredibly addictive and enjoyable. The game is designed so that mistakes can be made during clue collecting (ie, you miss a clue) and interrogation (ie, you fail to call out a witness on a lie, or accept a lie as the truth) without a failure-state; it simply makes it more difficult to come to the correct conclusion at the end of the case, or it leads to a decreased score on the case. Each case has a very powerful film noire feel, and the cases are often based on historical cases from the 50s. You play Detective Phelps, an WW2 veteran who has turned to detective work for the LA police, and you interact with diverse, interesting characters, all with great voice acting and motion capture. To sum it up, there's not really any other game like this one, so if it appeals to you, get it!

While solving the main story mystery there are mini-games/crimes that will show up. Some of the mini crimes tie into the main storyline but are not essential. They are great if you feel the need for some action. There are also cars, badges and film reels scattered about that you can collect in a Free Roam Mode.\n\nThe only issue I had was the 30FPS cap on the game which can make the game seem choppy at times but it doesn't ruin the game.
