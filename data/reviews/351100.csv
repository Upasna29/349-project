That fact doesn't affect review in any way.\nTL;DR Kingdom and Terraria had a baby and it was a slow viking.\n\nThe game gets you going: you want to unlock new facilities, see more of crafting and explore the world. There's no freedom of digging like in Terraria, but there are tunnels 2 floors down of your starting location. Clearing tunnels is linear but quite satisfying. There's defense element about once an hour - you have skeleton waves which threaten destroying your home, that way you lose the whole game.\n\nWhat I also like:\n- every single icon of loot is well drawn, you want to have everything\n- gold gets you home quickly! and buys you nice stuff from the shop (city)\n- quests guide and teach you\n\nMy personal concerns, it may feel different for you:\n- walking is slow, comparing to Terraria\n- going back to your body after death is odd, although that way you will never lose your loot\n- melee combat is sloppy, but it must be a subject of easy improvement\n- I see no reasons to buy more lands, probably it's just backup bases\n- skill system is disabled and looks shallow at the moment\n\nWhat's making it Early Access:\n- UI needs improvement\n- balance issues\n- some annoying bugs but nothing critical\n- some content is locked\n\nFeels like a few months away from full release.","April 28","true","17.1"," 58 of 90 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","58","90","4","3"

It's all style and no substance. The graphics are fantastic but the actual game is MIA.\n\nCombat is literally just hold down attack until it's dead. Blocking when it even responds doesn't seem to do anything at all. The original Prince of Persia (1989), also an indie game, had better combat than Niffelheim (2016).\n\nThe rest of the game is just gather resources and build something that will let you craft ingredients to build other things that let you craft other ingredients to build more things, etc. 90% of game time is spent clicking on trees or on rock walls to cut them or mine them respectively. Very dull and there is no decision making at all apart from what order to build things in, which makes literally no difference to anything at all anyway.\n\nMaybe it will become more interesting as development continues, but for now avoid this game unless you want to stare vacantly at a very pretty rock wall as you chip away at it for half an hour to get enough gold ore to make your castle look a bit cooler and occasionally stop to click on some skeletons instead.\n\nIn summary this game is a beautiful and atmospheric grind with combat that's more a nuisance than a feature and zero decision making of any consequence. It might appeal to the kind of people who get a kick out of watching loading bars fill up.","May 17","false","15.0"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","33","47","2","2"

One where you have a much more personal connection with the world you're involved with, and one where the lore is much more tightly woven with your character and their goals. Enter Niffelheim, one part Kingdom, one part Tormentum, one part Banner Saga. A world which judging by the areas you wander through, have had the kind of detail lavished upon them that you rarely see outside of games -like- Tormentum, which is high praise, this is genuinely good stuff here.\n\nYou play a recently deceased Viking on their way to Asgard, as you sail in your funeral boat, burning brightly in the pyre, your soul is captured and you are taken to Niffelheim, where you must fight your way to Asgard by showing that yes, you are indeed worthy of your rest in the halls of the hereafter. However, to begin with you start in a place which can be best summed up as bleak, yet beautiful. Wind and snow swept vistas combine with gorgeous hand painted scenery and a steady trudging viking complete with historically -accurate- (no horns!) armour, who must turn the little pittance of land he has found himself on into a defensible position, and then fight his way outwards, earning glory and fame before taking the fight to those that brought him to this forsaken land.\n\nThere's a lot to like here, but careful you don't cut yourself, this is a blade that's very much in the process of being forged...\nThe current state of Niffelheim is best described as rough. There's very little guidance for the player, and you're more or less left to your own devices to figure out exactly what is going on. There's a few quests to kindof guide you, but at least at this point, you're entirely on your own. Understanding how to navigate the world can prove a bit of a challenge in itself, combat is most definitely not a finished article and feels clunky and unrefined, the control mappings are unreliable and feel like they could do with some visual UI and UX elements to help ensure the player knows what's going on on-screen when they press various buttons.\n\nEven understanding how the character gains experience is going to be a real challenge to begin with, not to mention what items go in which slots, this is all stuff that will get fixed as time goes on, but make no mistake, on the Early Access scale, right now? This one is *Early*. Really Early. Having said that? I like it. I genuinely like it. There's a charm here that just grows on you, from the almost Tormentum like puzzle in the Workshop to open the safe to the various graphical indications to show how wounded the wildlife is, there's a lot of incidental detail that helps make the world feel *alive*. There's clearly a lot of will to make this game -great-, and if the execution can be brought up to the level of ambition, Niffelheim has the potential to be a genuine classic.\n\nClosing thoughts\nNiffelheim is a very specific recommendation. If you're not afraid of dealing with bugs, control mappings suddenly not working, more bugs, strange obscurities like "WHAT ON EARTH DOES WARRIOR LVL 2 MEAN?", yet more bugs. Under that very unfinished surface is the raw metal of an excellent game. Once it's been put through the fires and the forge, once it's been finished and polished, this could be an essential game. I truly hope the devs make it the game it deserves to be, because this is one I've got my eye on, and dearly hope it will come through on what it promises.\n\nVerdict : If you're looking for an Early Access that offers something different and special, this might just be it.","April 28","true","2.8"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","25","34","2","0"

I've not played Kingdoms, but I have put in my fair share of hours into Terraria.  As one who has played many Early Access titles, I find this one to be more than satisfactory in terms of stability, bugs, and progress.  I'm 2 or 3 hours into gameplay at the time of this First Impression.\n\nIn short: I'm having fun.  The movement is slow, but the longer I've played the more I've come to accept it.  This is not a fast-paced, adrenaline filled action packed ride.  This is a plodding, lonely story of a Viking alone in the winter, building himself up as time allows.  Once I accepted this and sat back to enjoy the ride, the pace became both bearable and understandable.  I've not yet played co-op/multiplayer, but it intrigues me - the pace may well bother me more with others involved, we shall see.\n\nWhat I have done is die.  I've died to boars, I've died to bears.  I've died to rock giants.  And I've enjoyed it.  In addition to that however, I've built a place for sheep I have yet to figure out how to catch, collected a stack of wolf pelts and a handful of bear and boar skins, crafted some better armor, built up a woodworking area and a small, level one smeltery.  I've mine down a few levels below my hovel, slaying skeletons along the way and avoiding the rock giants as best I can.  In doing this, I'm aware I'm only scratching the surface.\n\nI see the direction this is headed, and the potential it holds.  It is a solid Early Access entry, and I look forward to watching it evolve.  Currently:  It is slow.  Combat is very basic.  Chopping trees takes a long time compared to similar games.  Food is odd, as I can apparently eat 7 or 8 entire bears before I'm fully healed.  However, the game is unfinished - there is a lot of ground yet to cover, and despite the previous drawbacks, everything else provides for a very solid framework moving forward, and is already currently an enjoyable experience.","April 30","true","4.3"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

Its the perfect match of crafting and fighting for us. He often get bored in crafting games because I want to venture out and find something to fight, while I'm usually content to mine and craft away. In this game we both get what we want, and the combat while a little wonky and in need of some fine tuning is still enjoyable. I would love to see them continue to work on this game. My only concern is I cant find anything but a facebook and a twitter account for the game, no website, no wiki in place. However even if the game was left as is, I'm fairly happy with this purchase and don't regret it.

The amount of hours you can get out of this game is insane. The beautiful art style combined with the RPG elements can make you forget about the time. There are always things to improve.\n\nThe best part is that this game is in early acces wich means that not even all features are inplemented yet. The game runs smooth and should be easy to handle on most systems. This game goes deeper than you might expect but that was fun about it. Getting suprised by the content this game offers.\n\nA word of caution though. You should not buy this game if you hate collecting the same objects over and over again to use for bigger and bigger projects. Also this game can come over as confusing the first time you play it but learn of your mistakes, start another game and you are on your way.\n\nIf you are looking for a fresh unique 2d art style RPG game, look no further.\n\n\nThis is what to expect of your first playthrough:(please do not watch if you are looking to be suprised in this game)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSS5ZaAaHO0","April 29","true","2.2"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","15","25","2","0"

You play as a dead viking who is stopped by some demons from entering Valhalla, and instead they bring him to Niffelheim, which is a sort of limbo. Here, you will fight monsters, skeletons and other creatures of Norse mythology.\nThere is no story in the rest of the game, but I do appreciate the setting, which isn't used often in gaming, and it was a breath of fresh air from all the Greek mythology games.\n\nGRAPHICSThe hand-drawn graphics are a beauty to look at: the backgrounds are full of detail and the character models are excellent. The only nitpick I have are the animations, which are a little bit too stiff and static.\n\nGAMEPLAYThis is going to make or break the game for you. If you are into Minecraft or any other game in which you collect resources to build houses and such, you are going to love this game. If you prefer a focus on action, you will be hugely disappointed.\nThe controls are very awkward, both with k/m and a controller. Chopping down trees and mining mines are really tedious, and the combat is very unresponsive: you keep mashing the attack button hoping that your opponent dies first, since trying to use the shield doesn't stop the attacks. Exploring the environments isn't even all that fun because your viking moves at a snail's pace.\nThese are all issues that those who enjoy this genre will look past, but other players will be hugely disappointed. Since it's in Early Access, I hope it gets fixed in the future to make the overall experience more enjoyable.\n\nCHALLENGEAs stated before, the combat is very hard to grasp, and most encounters turn into a constant "attack-drink potion-attack" loop. Finding resources, while not necessarily hard, is very boring and long.\n\nSOUNDThe voice acting is decent, and the soundtrack and ambient noises are very good.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThere is definitely a lot of content in the game, and with more features being added over time, this has the potential of becoming one of the best games in the genre.\n\nOverall, this is a great game for fans of this genre and one of the better Early Access releases in the last few months. But, if you are like me and prefer a more action-oriented game, I think you should give this a pass.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 8.5\nGameplay: 7\nChallenge: 8\nSound: 8\nReplayability: 8.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 4\nFRUSTRATION: 7\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","May 5","true","6.8"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","1"

You are farewelled in the traditional Nordic fashion which is to be sent into the sea on a burning ship for your last voyage. The demon of death had something else planned for you; they stole your ship and welcomed you to the world of darkness. Fallen soldier, welcome to Niffelheim!!\n\nNiffelheim is a 2D/ Adventure/Action game were you take control of a fallen warrior in the world of Darkness called Niffelheim. At the start of the game, you will have to choose which faction (four in total) you want to play. You will start the game in front of a mine, which, by the way, is yours. On the screen, you will notice four icons, two on the right hand side and two on the left hand side of your screen. On the right, you will have the character icon which will include your character health with ten levelling abilities (Miner, Blacksmith, Carpenter and more) and a chest where you can store items. On the left hand side, you will have the map of the world as well as the mail icon where you can activate quests!\nIn this game, you have to gather wood, food and minerals so you can not only build useful structures within your own castle (base) or on its perimeters, but also craft useful items.  In your castle, you will be able to build a sawmill, a forge, a kitchen, an alchemy and an additional chest to store more items. In addition, you will be able to venture deeper within your castle through the mines where you will find useful minerals.\n\nNiffelheim is really an exploring side scrolling game. You will be able to visit the temple city or conquer the other three provinces on the main map.\n\nFor the combat phase, you will come across several wild animals and undead enemies. In basic terms, you will just use your mouse to hit your foe. Just keep pressing the mouse button and you will constantly hit your enemies. If your enemy is too strong, you are probably going to die. If you do, you’ll become a ghost (well, it is the best term I can come up with) and you will have to find your fallen body to resurrect.\n\nI really like the artwork and the crafting aspect in this game but I do feel that the fighting phase is a little bit of a letdown. However, this game is currently on early access and therefore there may be some improvements to come.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great artwork\n-	Interesting theme based on the Viking mythology\n-	Good exploring and crafting elements\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Fighting phase could be better\n-	This is a slow pace game\n\nNiffelheim is currently on early access and has great aspect about it. I personally feel that the game need to be refined in regards to the fighting phase but apart from that it is a very interesting game.\n\n7/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

(Ellada Games) sent me a key for review and to make content for YouTube free of charge, prior to official release. That fact doesn't affect review in any way.\n\nFirst thing i would like to say is that I have been waiting for a game like this for a while and would like to thank the Dev. for sending me a copy of Niffelheim.\nNiffelheim is looks really good; i love the art style as it is hand drawn.\n\nThis is a 2D Action adventure RPG game,\nYou start out at your base on the map style of your choice, and from here you start harvesting, mining, dungeon crawling and crafting.\n\n\nYour Viking is a bit slow at walking, you need to chop down a lot of trees and mine a lot to get started.\n\nIf you enjoy crafting and what that brings with it and dungeon crawling, you have a hard time trying to stop playing this game once you start.\n\nI do like the fact that you have to walk back to your body when you die (I have only died once) although I didn’t die far away from Base and I could see this being annoying/tedious if you die far away from base, especially with the current walking speed and no option to run (I couldn’t find a run button in the control menu)\nPros:\n\nThe art style of the game (all is hand drawn beautifully)\n\nVery good game, Runs stable not a lot of bugs from what i have seen with my time playing the game.  (I only have encountered 2 bugs so far)\n\nBuild and improve your base, explore dungeons, defend your land, Craft new weapons and gear.\n\nCo-op and multiplayer.\n\nTrading cards.\n\nAchievements.\n\n\nCons:\n\nChar walks kind of slow\n\nYou have to eat a lot of food to get your health back\n\nCombat is a little sluggish and blocking does not seem to do much\n\nSome content is locked for now\n\nBalance issues\n\nUI and hot keys needs some tweaks/improvement (although you can change the hotkeys yourself)\n\nThe controller option doesn’t seem to work for me at the moment (I have a 360 controller)\n\nThere is nothing out there like this game and i have been waiting for a game exactly like this. Although Niffelheim Feels like it’s quite a few months away from full release I can recommend that you should be confident enough to buy it; it's worth it even as early access.\n\n\nMy Video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cKHmEBk8hI","April 29","true","0.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I consider it a very casual game of crafting and getting lost in dungeons that starts off very very rough and you will continue to die and die and die.  Once you start crafting and trading you can get money relatively quick and buy very strong weapons and death will be hard to come by once you understand potions and food.  You can spend an hour in a dungeon and then another hour building a wall around your fort.  There is a lot to do and it keeps forcing you to switch up prepare yourself.","May 4","true","16.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I have played it extensively over the last couple of weeks.  There is so much potential here and the possibilities are endless.  This is a fantastic work in progress!!  Mostly I have been playing Single Player Mode.\n\nMultiplayer is fun as well and you can all work together on the same Castle/Homestead or you can each start at separate Castle/Homesteads and eventually meet up once you can get past that bear/buffalo/boar.\n\nThe only difference is that if you start at the same Castle/Homestead you are friendly to each other and all have access to the same Castle/Homestead.  If you begin at different Castle/Homesteads, then you can still trade by just dropping stuff, but you can attack each other, plus you cannot gain access to each others Castle/Homestead.\n\nSPOILER ALERT!!!\nAt the beginning you have to stay pretty close (very close) to base and farm and mine but then once you have a constant food supply you can then begin to move farther out and eventually get to the city and beyond.  So farm some trees and mine some ore below the base and begin by building the Cooking Workstation, Sawmill, and Forge.  Also, start constructing your home on top and setup at least one if not two Farming Workstations, try to acquire some seeds from scavenging up top especially Honey Pumpkin seeds, if possible, (Bean seeds are not too bad either), place them in your farm, and then you should be set from a food standpoint.  You still need to upgrade your Farming Workstation on top to collect 15 produce at a time but both Honey Pumpkins and Bean can be cooked in the Cooking Workstation and will yield 100HP each.  This is the easiest and simplest food to cook and it is available in the 1st level Cooking Workstation.\n\nMoney can be earned easily once you have the ability to get past the Buffalo or Bear and get to the city.  There is a 1st Level Wolf Headpiece that can be made at the Sawmill that yields 94G each.  Takes just (2) Wolf Skin per Wolf Headpiece.\n\nYou can also get by those buffalo's or bears (if you don't want to fight one) and get to the city, if you are willing to spend 50G, by accessing the Map in the upper left hand corner, then you just select the city in the middle and you just beam there.\n\nI do believe this only works AFTER you actually visit the city once so you still have to fight your way past that bear or buffalo the 1st time.\n\nAlso, build those inventory chests because you will probably need every one!  I do because I am such a hoarder!  Actually it would be nice for way to add more slots to your inventory chests.  I did discover in that if you are able to eventually purchase another Castle/Homestead (takes 12K Gold) then you have access to a new Castle/Homestead that needs to be leveled up, plus a brand new mine to get your ores, etc., but you can begin the inventory chest creation process all over again and you can transfer some of that extra inventory to that new Castle/Homestead.  Upgrading your castle goes a lot faster if you move excess materials to the new location.\n\nI was also able, at the new location, to build (2) extra farming workstations on top, throw sheep or the chicken in and start producing eggs or wool.  I still have the (2) Honey Pumpkin farming workstations at my original Homestead/Castle producing (15) each Honey Pumpkins which can be taken downstairs to the Cooking Station to produce the 100 HP food.\n\nOne of the things I love about this game is that when crafting, all items required for crafting may take a little bit of work but still they are attainable with just a little bit of effort.  I have constructed all of the highest levels items so far with the exception of the sword that requires that Demon Skull, which I still haven't found.  Today, I found the Dragon Forebearer charm in my mine, trapped the required (20) sheep, earned the 10K Gold required, acquired the Dragon, and fought the (3) huge demons that come and attack your castle.  That was a blast!\n\nThis game is a lot of fun if you like mining, crafting, gathering, and fighting.  Hopefully this game will see its true potential.  There are still (3) other lands for the developers to finish (currently they are just duplicates of the 1st land) plus Ancient Portals plus the Witch, etc.  I can even see a day, developers willing, to be able to build boats (Viking Ship) and be able to travel to other continents with further adventures.","May 15","true","128.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Generally speaking, there are some imbalances that I'm sure are going to be fixed.\n\n\nThe overall style and feel is just right and feels different to other games of the genre.\nYou can feel every piece of handmade work that's flown into this game wherever you go.\n\nRecommended for anyone who doesn't mind some very fixable flaws and who like to see progress, as I'm sure it will be a joy to see this game grow.","May 21","true","1.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game is gorgeous, simply gorgeous and I can't wait for the rest of the art to be added in.  2D world and walking only left and right may look like a turn off to people, but I honestly enjoy it regardless, you can still grasp the world around you even without the ability to truly walk around it.\n\nWe've all become so used to games coming out as Early Access that say that they will be taking feedback and building upon the game, but not once have I run into a design team or a Developer that is as active on the Steam forums than and, one of the developers.  They are incredibly quick on replies even asking you to join his game to report errors or test them, quick with updates, and simply there.\n\nI cannot wait to see more of this game and truly believe that you should as well.  Please, just remember, that this is Early Access.  Do not buy it now if you do not want to deal with some bugs.  But if you are alright with that and are willing to help this game become greater, then do yourself a favor and pick it up.","May 4","true","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yeah, this game is horrendous ♥♥♥♥ and not worth the vast amount of time it takes to do anything in it.\n\nCombat is crap. You just hold down the attack key. Or walk away, at the same speed as the enemy. Unless there's a snow storm. In which case you'll walk much slower than them. Blocking does nothing.

I got killed 30 times in the first 10 minutes. I wanted to love the game. I am sorry. After I get slaughtered in every 20 seconds I lose my interest.\nThe 2D tech is ok, as I said beautiful but unplayable. The character so weak against enemies that I cant tell. outrageous s-hit gameplay.\n\ngraphics10/10\ngameplay 10/1\nfeeling 10/10\nplayability 10/1\n\nto me.\n\nThere is NO FUN in the game when you get slaughtered in every 20th second !!!!! It kills the feeling and I hit the "refund" button immediatelly . I cant pay for being tortured! there is a beautiful game , a gem, but UNPLAYABLE! no thanks, i wont waste money on such a "game". this isnt a game because this isnt fun!\n\nIF u think "Shadows Heretic Kingdoms" got a brutal S-hit playability u havent seen THIS c-rap. DONT waste ur money. DEEEEEP disappointment.\n\nI was expecting for a kinda hackNslash/adventure. but THIS is nothing. Boring and annoying. Outrageous weak character, and I am suppose to build something wood hut in the kingdoom of the ghosts??? what kind of game is it?????????????","April 28","false","0.3"," 23 of 121 people (19%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","19","23","121","10","4"
