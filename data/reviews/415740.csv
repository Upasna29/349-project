"http://steamcommunity.com/id/medohgeuh/recommended/415740/","medohgeuh","Doomgal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/medohgeuh/","616 products in account","As a sarcastic anti-game, OmniBus is a masterpiece in its own right, arguably the best of its kind since landmark cult hit Goat Simulator arrived some years back.\n\nViewed as any other release? Positive-leaning mixed feelings.\n\nThe concept of a vehicular platformer is a an exceedingly rare novelty in itself. I struggle to think of any other game that defines itself as such, much less so in the way OmniBus dares to present itself. To consider this anything less than commendable would be a disservice.\n\nMind you, that's not to say OmniBus doesn't have its shortcomings; the lack of a camera control makes certain actions harder than they really need need to be, the physics are often far more unpredictable than reasonably anticipated and while the humor works for me, others are likely to put off -- dry sarcasm is very much a love it or hate it sort of thing.\n\nThe same could also be said for the game's aesthetics; early 90s throwback visuals and bouncy chiptune are right up my alley, but for those unaccustomed to a period when the average game looked and felt no different? Further disappointment.\n\nTo put it simply: OmniBus isn't a game for everyone. Then again, it isn't trying to be, and maybe that's really what I like about it best, anyway.","May 30","true","1.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/step1/recommended/415740/","step1","Sylux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/step1/","281 products in account","I was able to salvage a version of this game for the Atari Jaguar. It wasn't easy getting my hands on it but.. here is my review of it.\n\nOmniBus is a simple, fun, challenging, quirky physics game that lets you drive an unstoppable bus. There are three modes currently for the game:\n\nFirst is  Story Mode  which features unique worlds with levels/missions that are very different from each other to complete. There are hidden levels to be found in each world, hidden hats that you can acquire in each level to customize your bus and lastly there are giant evil bosses. Each mission will sometimes provide you with a different bus to use with a unique ability for example a hovering mechanic or a jumping ability to jump across platforms. Each mission also has a ranking system. Finish a mission with the least amount of time to earn the best medal, but let me tell you, it is very challenging and will keep you on your toes trying to go for the gold.\n\nThe second mode is  Freeplay mode.  this is essentially the sandbox version of the game which lets you choose any world you currently have unlocked as well as the many different unique buses with abilities you can use. You drive colliding with anything in your path while doing stunts and tricks to get a high score.  There are also hidden hats to be acquired in this mode as well.\n\nLastly there’s  Versus mode . This mode is up to 2-4 players. Players get to choose any bus that has been unlocked in story mode along with any hat that has been acquired. Once players have chosen their powerful bus of choice, they are able to select any level to be put up against each other. The objective is simple, to be the last bus standing.. on their wheels of course. It’s up to you if you want to ram other players to make them have a bad day, use the unique ability your bus has to get you back on your wheels or lead them to a bumper and launch them off the stage. The choice is yours.\n\nThis as well as finding the hidden worlds and getting every hat in story mode and freeplay mode gives this game a good amount of replayability.\n\nI will definitely try to 100% OmniBus in completion, but in the end I had to end up getting the Steam version of this game. My Atari Jaguar bit the dust and ended up dying on me.. see?","May 27","true","12.1"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"

Yeah, everything about this game is kinda ridiculous but it's actually incredibly funny and charming as a result.\n\nHere's the deal though, if you're not into the whole "whacky physics challenge" games like Surgeon Simulator or QWOP where part of the entire challenge is just fighting against the game, then you probably won't enjoy this much. Your bus can go flying at the drop of a hat and there's a lot of wrestling with physics and trying to keep your bus under control which can quickly go from funny to maddening. I've gotten stuck on a couple levels and felt quite frustrated, but in the end they don't take too much of your time to play and when you beat them it feels very satisfying, as a challenging game should.\n\nNow what's crazy is how incredibly creative the devs got - so far every single level has presented a new, unique challenge from anything before it that is still very fun and interesting, whether that be driving in a top-heavy tour bus trying not to tip over and lose your passengers or driving up the side of a building to knock King Kong off the top. It's very hard but addictive, and the ridiculous stupidity of it all just makes it that much better.\n\nWith the fact that each level has a gold medal that you can shoot for and there's a local multiplayer mode that looks kinda fun, I can see this game having a ton of replay value, and I'm definitely happy with my purchase. If it looks interesting to you, I say go for it, you'll get a sense of the game pretty quick and you can easily refund if it's not your thing!","May 26","true","1.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

Though the story mode might be on the short side, every level offers something different. I was surprised by just how much variety there was, with some game mechanics being created for one level only. The dialogue given to you before and after each level is very enjoyable, and the whole game has a great goofy tone to it. Nothing quite like using a propeller, a firework, a jet engine, and a soda bottle to shoot yourself to the moon.\n\nIt's not a very easy game, often taking one good hit to force you to restart a level. Fortunately, the stages are short enough and restart quick enough that this isn't really an issue. Though I must admit, having my bus almost jump up and spin around after hitting a tiny snag was frustrating on occasion. Omnibus isn't perfect, but it does have a great feel, especially when your bus of choice reaches over 100 mph.\n\nThough it may be short, there is a lot of replay value here. Each level hides a hat to collect, and there are target scores/times to beat in each stage. Not to mention secret areas to find. Plus, free-play mode is great fun - feeling a bit like a Pro Skater game in a bus. You can even challenge up to 4 people to a split-screen bus deathmatch.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a few solid hours of silly fun, I'd totally recommend this one.","May 27","true","6.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

The trailer was pretty funny and I liked the overall concept, so I preordered it while it was on sale. However, there are some major gameplay issues that have made OmniBus one of the most frustrating games I've ever purchased. (I do realize that OmniBus is *supposed* to be ridiculous and perhaps even mildly frustrating by its very nature, but there are several *unintentional* issues with the game that severely limit its enjoyability.)\n\nFirst, and most importantly, are the mid-air controls. The primary challenge of OmniBus (and, theoretically, the fun) is in recovering from the wild arcs that your bus takes through the sky after it's launched to the stars by bumpers, ramps, TNT, and more. However, the way the controls are oriented makes the bus almost impossible to land safely, leaving your bus's fate up to chance. The issue lies in the fact that the left/right keys (and A/D keys) cause the bus to do a barrel roll in either direction. A more intuitive approach would be to make the aforementioned keys rotate the bus horizontally around the X-Y plane. I also recommend increasing the rate at which the bus's rotation accelerates in the direction the user chooses; right now, it's extremely difficult to influence how the bus lands.\n\nSecond, the physics engine is bizarre. I know, I know, weird things are supposed to happen in this game, but there are still obvious glitches that make no physical sense. For instance, oftentimes when my bus is on only two if its four wheels for a short period of time, it gets launched into the air without warning. Hopefully these sorts of problems are fixed relatively soon as players report them via reviews and the Google Form the devs provided along with the release.\n\nThird, many of the levels are poorly designed. For example, the bandit level (in which you have to knock over 9 bandit vehicles before being knocked over yourself) can be won by doing absolutely nothing and just letting the bandits run into you; they often tip themselves over as they collide with you, and when *you* get tipped over, the bandits keep running into you, which turns your vehicle upright. Another example is the train robbery level, in which the bus falls straight through the train tracks that bridge various plateaus.\n\nFourth, the way the camera pans at the beginning of each level can be dizzying. Plus, there are often situations where skipping the camera pan offers a major strategic advantage at the beginning of a level, but there's no indication to the player that the pan is skippable (which it is by pressing the spacebar).\n\nMost of the issues I described above are very fixable, which is nice. I'd happily give OmniBus a thumbs-up if they were fixed - it isn't far from being a highly enjoyable game.","May 27","false","8.3"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

Half a decade later, they decide to get back to it and release the ancient game for PC.\nPROS: Many busses to choose from/unlock. Secret busses to find, secret levels,\nfree play/sandbox, etc.\nCONS: No level editor/workshop.\nFences and small props that go under your bus can make it go haywire easily. (which is\nactually kinda funny).\nI'd rate this game a 8/10. It's really silly and entertaining.

I get the joke of having wonky physics or a bus that easily flips over, but you're going to spend a lot of time in air not playing the game and landing upside down to start the level over from instant death. The joke wears thin quickly.\n\nThe joke of odd physics is way funnier when something looks initially real, or when something is going right like racing well in Burnout only to crash into a million pieces. The graphics here are Jaguar level and the bus is too unwieldy to feel like you're doing well.\n\nImagine if rather than being qwop/happy wheels inspired this game played with the tightness of controls Rocket League has. The levels could be scaled to be harder and you'd have a more fun game, one that was overall less frustrating.\n\nOmnibus is still a good game though. It's really varied in terms of level type, and the final boss even has you use all the basic mechanics to beat the game (something that many modern games forget to do.) You can also skip any level which is nice if you get fed up. I beat the game at 5 hours skipping 2 levels.\n\nI'd really like them to take another shot with this concept. Take the silliness out of the controls and put it into more of their inventive level ideas!","June 6","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
