That's your one sentence elevator pitch right there. YOU HIT THINGS WITH PARTICLES.\n\nAnd it works. To a point.\n\nIt's a really weird game because when it works, when your play and the game come together and you're spinning around this arena with your swarm of particles (hence "Swarm Arena") smacking the hell out of whatever comes your way, it feels tremendous. The way the music kinda syncs up with your actions and it feels like you're performing some sort of ballet of particle death and that, honestly, is really, really something.\n\nBut then you start to lose and a lose state in the game isn't quick and clean, it's the slow removal of your abililty to play the game as your swarm gets wittled down and wittled down. It's not quite a walk of shame a la Ridiculous Fishing, it's more that it seems like no-one could work out how to do this cleanly and fairly and just sort of went "that'll do". It wouldn't be such a big sin if it didn't drag the game out and into a state where it's just not, briefly, enjoyable to play. It's like your overriding memory of the last round isn't the bit where you're swooping round smacking everything with your particle army, it's the bit where you're trapsing around trying to keep these two particles going to get a few extra points. It doesn't even feel like clinging on desperately, just sort of "oh. well."\n\nNevermind though because Swarm Arena is worth it for the moments where you are THE PARTICLE KING and no-one wants to stop THE PARTICLE KING because THE PARTICLE KING has ALL the particles and he'll particle up your face. Or something like that.\n\nLook, it's good except for the endgame bit, OK?","September 26, 2014","true","2.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/46600/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","Swarm Arena is a great concept for a simple 1-on-1 battle arena game that is rather unique. You control a swarm of flying pixel thingies that when in range of your ship can be used defensively or offensively. Defense, forces the swarm to hold its position, providing you with some cover against incoming attacks, where Offensive has a number of modes (shoot, circle) used to push your swarm out to attack your opponent. The first person to hit the other ship wins.\n\nThe biggest issue I have is the lack of control you feel over your swarm. Despite any tactics you may try, such as seeing an opening to quickly attack your foe, your swarm doesn't move in to attack as you may expect making your chance to hit seem very random. Wrongly timed attacks can result in almost instant loss of your entire swarm leaving you very frustrated and likely to loose the round.\n\nThere are only a few different game modes to play, and with the age of this title now there is no-one playing online anymore. Unless you have friends who want to play you are stuck with the AI or score challenge modes. Talking AI, this has to be a strong point of the game. AI is tough (very tough!) and smart which is rare to find in a Triple-A title let alone a small indie game, but again due to the poor control system over your swarm this ultimately turns to frustration and not a legitimate challenge. This had great potential but simply doesn't pull it off!\n\nThis may keep you entertained for an hour or two, but would be unlikely to get much more out of it. I would only recommend grabbing this if you find it on a 75-90% off sale.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","May 13, 2014","false","1.4"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","1"

You control a energy blob that controls drones and with those drones you try to kill the other blob. You can pick up some powerups that give you abilities. But even with the abilities you don't have a lot of control over your drones. Most kills just feel a bit random. The gameplay just doesn't feel good in my opinion. It's also another one of those small indie games that focuses on multiplayer with no community that plays it.
