I find a couple of line reviews to be of not much use for potential buyers.\nFirst off, lets get this out of the way.  If you like Elite Dangerous you are going to either love this game or hate it.  That is because the Elite Dangerous community is torn between the arcade crowd and the sim crowd.  There are the old guard who believe the ED devs can do no wrong and the other camp which will quite loudly point out the worts.  ED is trying to cater to too many gamer types in my opinion and in the end causing a huge divide amongst it's player base.  Also the peer to peer instancing, ability to move from single player to multiplayer at a whim.  Did I mention all the instancing?  Everything is instanced.\n\nIf you love the "Oohh and Aahh" of flying into huge stations spinning in space, you will be disappointed in Evochron.  If you LIKE having things you explore for or targets to shoot magically appear in front of you, then this is not the game for you.  If you have to have cutting edge graphics in your game or total 1to1 universe, this is probably not the game for you.  If you like arcade flight models, magical space brakes and no realistic newtonian physics in outer space, this is probably not the game for you.  If you like having to leave the game to watch videos of how to play the game because the game doesn't give proper instructions (in-game) then this is probably not the game for you.  If you like to have a magical galaxy map with every star system in the galaxy shown to you and all you have to do is take the time to jump to them, this is probably not the game for you.  If exploration simply means jumping from system to system to see what variations of colored balls there are or where the next cool screen shot can be taken, this is probably not the game for you.  I think you get the point.\n\nIf on the other hand, you love feeling like you are in a sim with complex mechanics while flying through space.  You will love this game.  If you  want a smaller  map of the galaxy mapped out for you and you have to find all the rest, this is the game for you.  If you like playing co-op or multiplayer with the ability to host a server, or solo offline with no downtime from server maintenance, this is the game for you.  If exploration means searching for system or items as opposed to having them magically be mapped or appear, you are in the right place.  I could go on and on but here is the simple breakdown:\n\nCons:\n1.  No big spinning space stations to land in.\n2. Graphics are not as cutting edge as ED.  (Mods will fix this in the near future for high end systems)\n3. Galaxy is not billions of stars or true 1to1\n\nPros:\n1. Flight model is incredible and takes time to learn.  You will not be blasting enemies out of the sky your first time out.  You will have to learn how to fight with flight assist off and you will have to learn how to manage thrusters and heat.  There is no arcade mode here.  There is MUCH more to keep tabs on in this game.  You have a proper "Heads up Display" with lots of info to track.\n2. You can fly through space until you die.  Hit the afterburners and turn off flight assist and you will continue at that speed forever.  No instances.  You will move from sector to sector without ever seeing a loading screen and you never have to jump if you don't want to.  You can land on both atmospheric planets and not atmospheric planets.  There are weather effects and wildlife.  The progression from space to planet is SEAMLESS with no jarring transitions from one flight mode to another or transition screens.  Don't expect to fly from space to the planet surface in a matter of seconds, and you better manage your speed or you will burn up!\n3.  Space is very atmospheric.  I will not spoil it for you but travelling from system to system or even within one system will change what is arround you.  All of the dangers out there are not just enemy pilots.  You can find things on planets, in space, in asteroid rings etc.  Space is there for you to discover!  You find it, it doesn't find you.\n4.  You can build space stations and planet stations.  You can build your own ship anyway you like.  You can customize everything on your ship.\n5.  The economy is dynamic.  You can trade at stations, with NPC ships and even between players.  You can even give other real players contracts to do for you.\n6.  NPC wing mates.  Yes, you can have wings of NPC's.  Yes I said wings.  Up to 8 I believe.  That is 8 sets of wings.\n7.  Planets are big, beautiful and nicely detailed.\n8. The game plays incredibly smooth.  No stutters or bad load in of graphics.\n9.  Missions are fun!  Have you ever shot meteors hurtling towards a planet in a mission to save a planetary base?\n10.  Space chatter.  It's nice to hear some voices out there.\n11.  Ability to scan asteroids for their materials before you mine them.\n12. Travel on the planet surface in a Mech.\n13. Fly through and explore ancient tunnels within huge asteroids.\n14.  Most importantly - an amazing Dev.  He will update his games for years and has a true moral compass. He is extremely active with the community and will help you personally if you run into an issue.  This guy deserves all the success that could possibly come to him.  His games sell themselves on word of mouth.  VERY loyal community and the official forums on the main site are free of negativity.  Helpful dev and helpful community.\n\nI could go on but truly, if you love this genre, you will love this game.  There will always be differences between space games and that's ok.  What appeals to some does not appeal to others.  If you are truly on the fence go to the main site and download the free demo with 90 minutes of play time.  I suggest using all of the demo time on the in-game tutorial.  Why?  It's the best way to find out just how deep this game is.  You can always remove the demo and re-download it and your 90 minutes will start again.  Now you can play around and test things out.  No need to worry about steam refunds.  Devs who are confident in their products have DEMOS.

Everything I love about Evochron Mercenary and more.  You'll feel right at home when you start playing.  By far the best space sim I've played and I've played many.  So much to explore and lots of hidden items.  Multiplayer is awesome and the universe feels alive and not dull.  Many improvements on EM, such as the map system and graphics.\n\nAlso modding is REALLY simple in this game, as was the games before it.  Everything, including a demo is on the website, so check it out.  You can easily mod everything if you want.  Look for a lot of cool mods/additions and 3rd party tools to be released.  The community is great.\n\nMechs, I forgot to mention the terrain walkers.\n\nLots of information at the official site including a modding guide, don't like the tractor beam sound?  Simply create/download a new one and drop into the specified directory.  Want to remove mods? Just delete the directories.  Stay tuned, people will create amazing cockpits and hi-res textures for everything.\n\nThe trade system is really viable now, and prices fluctuate based on actions from players.  There is fighting over territory, economy and technology levels.  Crafting in the engineering lab.  If you want a hardcore space-sim with a great community, strategic attacks and a single-player game that plays just like multiplayer then this is your game.  If you want a pretty grindfest with no substance then you know where to play.\n\nDon't like the graphics, add your own.  Add your own models, textures, cockpits, HUDS, anything you want, make a total conversion and release it to the community.\n\nThere is a demo, you don't even need to worry about a refund.  Also, check out http://www.starwraith.com/evochronlegacy/development.htm if you have any doubts about what's changed.","January 18","true","135.4"," 114 of 130 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","114","130","4","1"

This game just appeared on the Steam homepage one day in late January 2016, on it's launch day, seemingly out of nowhere, and boy am I grateful it did.\n\nIt has since sort of disappeared from Steam's homepage, in one short week, and that is kind of tragic.  Not for me, no, but for the people who will love this game to bits and pieces, but never hear about it potentially.\n\n$25 get's me virtually everything I've ever wanted out of a sand-box space sim within Evochron Legacy's mere 350MB contents. This is a fully fleshed out and finished space sim. Fully....\n\nIt kind of boggles my mind, how this game isn't WAY more popular than it currently is, and how the general public hasn't seen it coming.  I'm sort of dumbfounded.\n\nForget about the shameful fleecing and unfinished game that Elite Dangerous is, or the Alpha tech demo arena that Star Citizen is.  At best, neither of those games will be realized as something resembling a finished game for years.  $25 bucks, right now, will grant you access to the fully fleshed out sandbox space sim that is Evochron Legacy.\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list, just something off of the top of my head as a newbie, and in no particular order:\n\n- Mine, trade, explore, mercenary, straight up combat roles to tackle.\n\n- Seamless planetary decent, into an actual dynamic atmosphere, planetary landings, and planetary exploration.\n\n- Ship construction, space station construction, terrestrial city construction... It's a virtual mini "city builder" game mechanic just waiting for you in game.\n\n- Terrestrial life forms.\n\n- An on-going war, bringing hostile zones to avoid or engage in whilst you choose your adventure in this HUGE sandbox.\n\n- True single player and multi-player options, dynamic affected economy and prices to keep track of and master in either flavor.\n\n- Customize specialized ships for the tasks and/or missions you wish to tackle, store said ships in hangers.\n\n- Newtonian physics styled flight in a space vacuum, which is great fun to learn, that changes when entering different atmospheres and gravitational pull.\n\n-The "simulation" aspect of this game is incredibly deep, and if you just want to fly around ala "EuroTruck Simulator in space," the price is worth that experience ALONE.  I've spent mad hours just getting a handle of navigation and flying, and I'm probably not even half way there in utilizing all the in flight data and options to the best degree put before me.\n\n- BOOKMARK the map, and jump to said bookmarks.  Use bookmarks to make notes. (whooooaaaaa) lol\n\n- Huge Universe!  Is it "1:1 Milkey Way" huge? Nope. But for a sandbox I reckon I'd be lucky to explore half of it in under 1,000 hours of game time just dedicated to exploring, let alone the hours and hours of activities and on going war to participate in whilst trying to explore.\n\n- The community is small, but seemingly everyone in it is there out of a real love for this game, and to help.\n\n- It's basically developed by ONE person, and he is full time is dedicated to listening and helping sort things out.\n\n- It's only $25 bucks, and it's an ACTUAL FINISHED GAME.  That's all you pay.  No surprises in the pipeline, just fixes and updates.  Buy it, and get ready to sink crazy hours into what the Evochron Universe has laid out for the nerd in you to do.\n\nSome minor cons to take into consideration:\n\n- It's not as pretty as the two "AAA" unfinished space sims out there graphically, BUT it is reported to be EXTREMELY mod friendly.  And mind you, it's ALL here right now to enjoy.\n\n- Xbox Controller support (Xbox controller, NOT ANY FLIGHT STICK), hasn't exactly been perfected, nor will it likely be.  There seems to be just too many controls needed to be mapped, making it rather pointless. Like I said, the "flight simulation" aspect of this game is really, really deep.  You can't "drop and pickup" your Xbox controller like GTA V or the like, there's just too much going on in the flight simulation.  That being said, mouse+keyboard works very, very well.\n\n- If you are looking for a dumbed down AAA title that you've learned all the mechanics within 30 minutes, and are rocking into the half-way point 8 hours into it, you're going to be disappointed.  This is a pretty hardcore sandbox simulation.  You're going to spend the first 8 hours grasping the mechanics of it all, even more so like myself as a newbie, before even really starting to engage in the Universe.\n\nI quite simply cannot recommend Evochron Legacy enough if you are looking for a straight up sandbox space sim, with tons and tons of things to do in it.  Even if you just want to try a space sim, this is the one to try due to it's incredibly fair price, history of support, and the fact that it is so mouse+keyboard friendly at it's core for gameplay.\n\nIt's abundantly apparent that the person who developed this game has a clear and concise passion for it, and this game deserves to be enjoyed and discovered by many more than are currently playing it.  You simply cannot say that about many games, but I can confidently say this about Evochron Legacy.\n\nCheers people, see ya in space.","January 26","true","55.3"," 49 of 51 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","49","51","2","1"

Everything you doing in one afect the others (exept if you building station or storing item in mp or sp it won't apear it in both which is logic) so you can either playing in mp and continue in Sp when you like (yes this game do not require a internet conection for playing single player). Mp is a very good way for progress with others player with a great atmosphere and friendly hand. It's not a war zone at all.\n\nThe game is also moddable. You basically can mod quite a bit of how it looks like. A modding kit is available for players interested.\n\nPersonal opinion : For this new tittle is jsut the game I was looking for many many years. Comparing to his brother EM it just amazing what ,a one man show, (yes only 1 developper) have arrived to created. The graphic as been improved, all weapons are new, new mission available, design of planet change and more realistic, combat is much easier, new uncharted system, a new crafting aspect with along a new shipyard system. Addition of hiding equipment with hiding point of interest..... The list is long and amazing.\n\nSound like a good choice but still not persuaded? Try out the demo !

No internet connection required.  Multiplayer? Theres small servers you can join, or run your own server.\n-  Persistant world, even in singleplayer.  Your actions directly effect territory control or local market conditions.\n- You can mod Evocrhon Legacy. I'm currenly running MasterEffect Reborn to spruce up the graphics,  and some texture and  HUD mods.\n- No innane and arbitrary timesinks.  In otherwords, you don't have to spend 15 minutes traveling to a space station after entering a system.  Hyperspace will bring you right to it.\n- More freedom.  Example, your top speed is not limited.  You can for instance, keep boosting yourself to ludicrus speeds, turn off flight assist, and just coast doing 5 digits in speed, and you'll keep that way until you decide to slow down (which will cost you fuel), or you collide into something.\n- You can construct items, and buildings.  Want to build a base on a planet or a space station? You can do that.\n- You can travel to and fly around in every planets atmosphere  in the game.  No extra DLC fee required.\n\nCons:\n- Graphics look dated. I wouldn't say they are absolutely terrible, but if your wanting bleeding cutting edge graphics with all the bells and whistles, your in for a mild amount of disappointment.\n\n- Game has a steep learning curve.  But then so does Elite Dangerous.  It's this learning curve that will be your biggest hurdle to overcome to get the most out of this game.","February 27","true","99.3"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","4"

It sounds funny, maybe even a little cool, until you jump on a player server and get completely ♥♥♥♥ on by 5-6 year players for asking a question like "is there a bounty system or kill rewards" or something as simple as "can someone give me some pointers on a good trade route?"\n\nI was told vehemently that if I asked any more questions I would be banned for "spamming" and "being annoying / a dumbass".  These topics are barely if at all covered in the tutorial, which I was told to play (I went through some parts twice).  I asked each question individual, receiving a simple "no" for the first question and a "are you really just going to spam chat all day" for the second.  Not to mention (look at the comments here, pretty much explains it all.  The community is either incredibly awesome and chill, or the fedora of all fedora's.  Just some food for thought, I had a bad experience trying multiplayer.\n\nActual game review:\n\nThis game is not for everyone.  If you like hardcore space-sims with realistic and frustrating flight controls, this is probably for you.  If you enjoy the simulation aspect of Elite Dangerous...  Well, this is a poor mans elite dangerous.  I know I will get flamed for this because the community love for this game is so powerful, but I feel obligated anyways, since the tutorial itself takes long enough to get you past refund territory.\n\nPretty much all of my questions about the game to other people have resulted in "dude, you must be bad" responses.  I have over 100 hours in ED and feel comfortable with space sim flight.  The main TL;DR point being:  This is not worth $25\n\nI understand this was made and developed by a single guy.  That's impressive and a fact to be celebrated.\n\nI'll keep it down to concise-ish points:\n\nIf you're looking for a game like X3, that allows building and empire management, this is not the game for you.  You can build stations but the function is essentially worthless as far as I've been able to deduce, it just gives you another place to stock up / refuel.  The fleet system doesn't fix this either.\n\nPlanets and being able to fly around them seemed to be one of the strongest features advertised in the game material.  But there is literally zero point in visiting a planet.  They offer nothing and are relatively difficult to access especially in relation to just docking at a normal space station.\n\nThe game seems to pride itself on a lack of story or overarching theme.  In my opinion this is not a feature, and leaves a massive hole in my gameplay experience / makes most things pointless.  The game consists of flying around (very slowly), dealing with realistic physics, etc.  By comparison, Elite Dangerous' flight performance is much more fun, and I'm not even a huge fan of Elite Dangerous to begin with.\n\nYou cannot ascend past a "fighter" class of ships, everything is built modularly on a fighter chassis and you can't progress past that.  There are no larger ships that you yourself can fly, or own.  Which kind of renders the "trading" feature moot because cargo ships aren't even really cargo ships.  To top it all off, fighters feel extremely sluggish and clunky, I understand it's a space simulation but effective dogfighting really just boils down to "strafing" in circles around and enemy.  This results in shallow progression at best.\n\nYou will die in seconds to just about any enemy.  I have 2mil credits and the best ship that my amount of money could buy, a decent mid-range ship following common-sense as well as old Mercenary ship guides.  I get my ♥♥♥ handed to me by the first enemy that targets me.  This has pretty much pinholed my gameplay into hours of hiding behind allied AI ships and hoping I don't get targetted by the enemy AI.  So I'm essentially driving a Ferrari and getting outpaced by 1987 Honda Civic's in a race that pays me $40,000.  Half of that will go to refueling and repairing.\n\nThe Shipyard system is unique, but I find it unintuitive.  It's very confusing, but even after understanding it I still don't like it.\n\nEquipment modules lack diversity.  You can use lasers and missile, that's it.  After a few hours you've officially seen the full range of diversity offered by Evochron Legacy.  Missiles sounds like fun?  Too bad, you have to reload and rearm your missiles after every mission, they are a one shot deal.  Which sure, it's realistic, but is it fun?  Not really.  I'd at least prefer a number of charges per missile rack installed.  Even 5 would be cool, because currently I shoot 4 missiles and that's that, no more for the entire fight.\n\nLast but not least, this game suffers from a very empty universe.  This is a common theme in a lot of Space Sims, but this seems to be one of the worst.  I brought this up on the Evochron forums, and was essentially called an idiot, because "there's plenty of stuff out there".  Except you get nothing for discovering it.  I'm sure at very special coordinates XXXX YYYYY ZZZZZ you'll find a anatomically correct floating rock chiseled into the shape of Gabe Newell's nut-sack, that's awesome man.  Enjoy flying for hours and not getting anything out of it.\n\nThat's really it, unfortunately I cannot refund the game.  I feel like, point blank, the advertisement and text about the game is misleading.  Take that how you want.","January 19","false","9.6"," 160 of 253 people (63%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","63","160","253","18","51"

I didn't even see it on Steam first, someone posted about it on a Star Citizen facebook group. Apparently Steam thinks I'm more interested in seeing 10,000 X Rebirth advertisements. It's sad because this game could really use more exposure.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it's everything Elite aspired to be yet failed to become. But if you value a massive galaxy, play Elite. If you value the most beautiful graphics ever, play Star Citizen. Where this game shines isn't in graphics, or the size of its universe (though its universe is in some ways, ways that I think matter, bigger than Elite), but in its content, in its gameplay, which is simply some of the best I've seen in... ever. It's literally the best I've seen and that's why I'm amazed I haven't heard about this until now.\n\nSo let's go over the pros:\n+Open to modding. Private servers. Make your own server, your own world, customize it the way you want. I haven't explored this nor seen many examples of it so far, but that's to be expected so soon after release. In the coming months there will hopefully be some good mods available. So far it seems only that graphical changes are possible, perhaps some remodelling and some new missions. Time will tell how much modders can do to this game.\n\n+A truly open world. Go anywhere. Do anything. Land on any planet, attack any vessel, attack any space station or city. It looks like you can even devote resources to researching new weapons and components not normally available.\n\n+A real sandbox. You can build your own space stations and sprawling cities on the surface, and attack them as well.\n\n+Ship customizability. It's simplistic yet refreshingly open. I put it at a step above Elite's ship customization. You can change out weapons, engines, shields, plating, etc., but also change the fundamental capabilities of your frame by changing crew capacity, energy levels, fuel tanks, how many hardpoints you have, etc. You can also customize the appearance of it by moving wings, engines, etc., and choosing between a few (sadly only a few) colors.\n\n+You can form a fleet. It can be NPC's or players. I'm fairly sure it can only be NPC's in single player, and only players in multiplayer, not sure... hopefully a mod changes that eventually, or the dev does.\n\n+Very stable. Haven't crashed once, nor encountered any bugs of any kind. In the days of EARLY ACCESS (even when they don't say early access anymore) a game that legitimately feels like a finished product is a rare thing.\n\nCons:\n-Graphics are pretty poor for this day and age.\n\n-Combat for a newbie, especially during the combat tutorial, is likely to be frustrating. Your ship shakes violently when you take hull damage and it's quite annoying.\n\n-Few people play it, with about 75 average right now according to steamcharts. There are probably a few more who bought it from the developer's website rather than through Steam, but I doubt it's more than 100-125 average. For such a large world spread across many systems and sectors, space might be lonely. For this reason, I highly recommend you play this with a friend if you're the sort who needs the online component.\n\nUpdate:\n-Mission system seems threadbare, and it's often hard finding a mission you want to do.\n\n-Lack of interaction with capital ships. They're shiny juggernauts in space that seemingly hold no purpose.\n\nBoth of these things are, from what I've heard, being worked on by modders. They remain cons for the game as it shouldn't be the community's job to flesh a game out.\n\n-Another negative: While you get more "to work with," so to speak, at higher tiers of ship, it does not seem possible to truly expand beyond what the initial ships are capable of. If you are a miner in your beginning ship, you can customize your ship to have the maximum number of cargo holds, giving you room for 250 items. However, even with the largest of ships, it does not seem possible to exceed this limit of 250 items.\n\nUpdate 2:\n-When I got the game, I did so after having asked questions on its forums. Among them was whether or not capital ships were available for player use. The answer was "no, but someone's working on a mod to make them available." It seems I was misled and this is not even possible. The game is open to mods but not as much as I initially thought, and for the most part mod support includes changes to the HUD and graphics, rather than any changes to gameplay (though addition of new missions is possible, it seems).","February 5","true","12.4"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","12"

For detailed game information and analysis I recommend StarWraith's Evochron Forum.[www.starwraith.com]*\n\nA Precious Indie Jewel...found in a pile of chipped glass.\n\nSpace, the vast tapestry of the night sky, became a personal symbol for me at a young age.  I remember lying in the meadow over the hill behind our house, far enough away from any human activity that I was able to feel truly unanchored, adrift.  It was just me, the stars, and the soft rustle of the wind through the goldenrods.  I soon discovered science fiction novels and video games, through which I experienced clandestine trysts with the stars.  I still see space in this way- a symbol of my desire for true freedom and self-determination, a concept that is both idealized and impossible.\n\nAt its best, space simming gives me a chance to immerse myself in a dream, intoxicated by the delirious mixture of total freedom, relentless peril, and unflinching solitude.  I've never been able to get into the more linear, mission-based style of space sims (Wing Commander, Freespace). And frankly, as a youngster, I saw the commercial success of these games as a mark against their integrity and worth.  I played them once and never played them again, resenting the obscurity of the gameplay experience I so loved.  Take as counterpoints Space Rangers or Star Control, games I continue to play every few months, many years after I first encountered them.\n\nThe rising Indie Era carries with a glut of new games identifying with any number of formerly niche or fringe markets, with the idea that these new games are made by people who like to play them.  Suddenly those sacred tropes are everywhere: start as a nobody with a tiny ship, trade and fight your way to fame and fortune however you see fit.  Travel from base to base, help or hinder factions, explore the vastness and exploit whatever you find.  I am giddy as I scroll through the many new titles built on this common formula.\n\nBut, as we have been forced to learn, the Indie Era has a darkside. For every labor of love built by caring craftsmen, there are five unruly messes abandoned without a second thought.  I know that life happens, and building a game is tough- but unfinished is unfinished.  I've had high hopes for a few- Drifter, Jumpdrive (formerly Paragon), etc. But alas.\n\nEven the multi-million dollar powerhouse Elite:Dangerous often feels half-finished.\n\nLet Their Crystallized Voice Proclaim...and let all thoughtful citizens sustain them\n\nMy first few hours in E:L were a revelation.  I had the same thought so many times it became a mantra: "One man and a contracted artist achieved in a year what Frontier hasn't in 30!"  Planetary landings even on atmospheric planets, modular ship and utility construction, escort jobs, etc, etc. Elite:Dangerous is an amazing game, no doubt, but the difference between Frontier and StarWraith in terms of intent and delivery is astounding. If ED is the sleek, high-design chair you ordered online from Ikea, then EL is the sturdy, simple chair your nephew made for you in his workshop out back.  StarWraith values craftmanship and community involvement over glamour and the clink of stacking coins.\n\nEL is a loving answer to all the issues we had with its predecessor.  Every system is improved.  The sim physics are tighter.  Missions are more complex, more diverse.  The hired artist designed new and more adept ship and object models.  There are far more items comprising a far wider range of uses.  And, one of my favorite points, the activity of AI entities and regional markets are more responsive to player choices and actions.  he game universe is procedurally generated and expands on demand, allowing for ever greater voyages and adventures that are entirely unique to the individual player's experience.\n\nIf you like space sims or space at all, buy it. If you appreciate craftsmanship and community involvement from a game studio, buy it.  If you just want to give a true artist the support he needs to practice his craft, buy it.  History will remember Evochron and StarWraith as major contributors to the space sim genre.\n\nNo Drama, Just Reviews","February 16","true","11.9"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","27","34","2","1"

Everything most people wanted from Elite, made by a handful of people.\n\nCustomizable ships, able to land on any planet (as long as you have a Walker), you can found and build space stations and cities online and offline, OFFLINE SINGLEPLAYER, this game does everything Elite does but better.  Aside, of course, from graphics and scale.  However there are still many cases where the game looks beautiful, especially when you enter the orbit of a planet you've never seen before.\n\nMy favorite thing has to be the newtonian physics.  Your space ship feels like a space ship.  Your accelleration depends on your mass and there's really no speed limit you can hit.  You have to think about how your thrusters affect your craft.  Unlike Elite, where you have a speed limit and your ship slows down if you go too fast.  That doesn't happen in the Evochron series, you need to learn how physics work and learn fast, else you pancake into a station.\n\nTo top it all off, the game feels alive.  You can hear radio chatter, controllers talk to you, the economy works, it all fits together.\n\nThe fact Frontier is rolling in money and has the empty space engine that is Elite, yet StarWraith is just one guy and a few of his friends and made the Evochron series blows my mind.\n\n10/10 space sim.\n\nSource:  Played the Evochron series for years, and probably have 400 hours in Elite Dangerous.

Seriously.\n\nIMO, the game play is right up there with -ANY- game I'm currently playing.  Legacy gives me just about every element that I desire in a space game that each of the other big titles lacks on some front.  Star Citizen is supposed to be the full-meal-deal, but it's barely even Alpha right now, and crashes regularly for me, so I can't really even compare that one.  That said, as I talk about this game, understand that I have hours into Elite: Dangerous, X3 War Pack, X: Rebirth, Starpoint Gemini 2, Rebel Galaxy, etc...\n\nThe graphics are a bit dated.  It's a bit complicated.  There's no getting out of your ship (at least that I have discovered yet).  Those are literally just about the only negatives (some would not consider those things negatives--graphics, for example, aren't much of a deal-breaker for me).\n\nThis game includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- Newtonian physics (that change depending on space/atmosphere)\n\n- Station docking\n\n- Planetary landing/atmospheric flight\n\n- Realistic dogfighting\n\n- Missions in space and planet-side\n\n- No traditional "load screens"\n\n- Free-jumping about the galaxy - have jump-drive, will travel\n- Can use gates, but they merely save you on fuel and time, they are not required for travel\n\n- Ship customization, ship component mix/match and upgrading\n\n- Empire building: station building, planet-side building, etc.\n\n- 3rd Person game-play\n- A big sell-point to me is that you can play this game as effectively in 3rd person as 1st\nperson.  There are almost no games doing that anymore and I love looking at my ship in\nspace as I adventure around.\n\n- Modding - Graphics, HUD, cockpits, ships, music, SFX, etc., can all be modded.\n\n- Support - The developer is a single person and after all these years of developing the Evochron   titles, he's still as responsive and passionate as ever.\n\nHonestly, I could write an excessive review for this game about how good it is, but the truth of the matter is that if this looks remotely cool to you--buy it.

I highly recommend the demo so you play through the tutorial and get used to navigation.  Don't let the length of the tutorial turn you off: these kinds of games are supposed to eat your time, and you'll be glad you had the practice because space is unforgiving.\n\nThe tutorial is especially helpful in teaching you a couple basic combat principles that only really apply in space.  Dog-fighiting is very different inside and outside of atmospheres and the effects of gravity, so you can use these differences to your tactical advantage.  Dodging incoming missiles is key to survival in combat as well, and is slightly more involved than timing your countermeasures properly.  The basics really are some of your best tools to survive, so learn them well.\n\nI recently just purchased Evochron Legacy, my first purchase in the series, and I'm blown away already.  There's quite a lot of customization available, and there's no shortage of contracts or conflict.  Even failures reward me with knowledge on game mechanics (pro tip: don't engage warp in an atmosphere).\n\nSeamless planetary transitions are incredible, and the planets also rotate!\n\nFuel is a precious commodity that must be preserved!  Proper course planning, maneuvering and jumping is the key to maximizing profits via saving fuel.  It can also keep you from getting stranded.  Fuel is burned up quite rapidly in dog-fights as well, so you'll want to manage every ounce effectively.\n\nI've read a lot of complaints about the UI, but I actually like it quite a bit.  After you understand what all the information relates to and what it means, it seems far less cluttered and it really lets you keep your eyes trained on your gunsights during dogfights, instead of checking instruments across the cockpit.\n\nIt's got a steep learning curve, and starting out can seem like a duanting task, but once you start to figure things out, more possibilities open up quickly, like hiring fleet members, developing your own weapons and ships, or even researching entirely new stuff.  Non-combat options and activities are abundant as well including (but not limited to) responding to distress signals, margin trading, transport contracts, building and exploring.\n\nI have only scratched the surface, but I can tell I'm going to be enjoying this game for a long time to come.  It's nearly everything I've been looking for from a sandbox space-sim, and more.  It's a testament to how greed has polluted gaming since it has features and complexity you would expect from teams of industry professionals with large budgets.\n\nThe graphics aren't the most breath-taking, but they aren't terrible.  The gameplay more than makes up for it and there's plenty of time and modding potential to improve those graphics.  From what I read, Evochron Mercenary received about 5 years worth of post-launch development, so there will be plenty of improvements over time.\n\nIt's refreshing to play a game that's not meant to be chewed up and spit out in a matter of a couple play sessions, and isn't an MMO giving out content in controlled morsels.\n\nDefinitely a good game to play with an Oculus Rift on, I think.  I'll be finding out soon enough.  :D\n\nUpdate: Evochron Legacy has been receiving steady fixes and patches the past couple of weeks.  It's cool to see regular activity in the form of bugfixing and improvements.","January 21","true","15.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Not the most flashy graphics, but still very nice with meticulous attention to the small details. The user interface is overwhelming at first, but the controls are intuitive. Be ready for a challenge, the tutorial does a decent job of easing you in to the game step by step, but the game is hard as nails. You can freely join multiplayer servers that are filled with experienced pilots and supported by a friendly online community.\n\nEvochron offers you multi-player and offline single-player functionality. So if you lose your net connection you won't get kicked out of the single-player game or denied access. It doesn't have  always-on DRM, which is found in some other games. No nickel and dime tactics, or huge walls of DLC to purchase until you get a complete game. Treating customers as trustworthy and deserving respect has become a major selling point, because sadly, appreciation for the customers seems to be missing in so many companies in the video game industry today.\n\nWould you believe that most of this game was made by one person? Incredible, really. The price point  is very fair for what you're getting in return. The game is super well optimized and runs smooth as silk on a mid-range computer.\n\nHighly recommended to space sim fans!","January 18","true","7.4"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","22","33","0","4"

I came to this game with my eyes wide open and understanding there is a lot to learn, which is why I gladly take advice from the helpful community.\n\nHere's a few pointers that may help anyone considering buying the game. If you want an arcade shooter, don't buy this game - you will dislike it. If you want the best graphics, don't buy this game - you will dislike\nit. If you have little patience, don't buy this game - you will dislike it. If you are in none of these categories, you may still dislike it!\n\nIf you are a mature (of mind) gamer, you may well like this game. I enjoy it, even though I have never put this much effort into learning a game in my life. I'm looking forward to future community mods and Dev updates to further enhance the experience of being an explorer in a complex and captivating virtual galaxy.\n\n\nFinally, having read about the history of the Evochron games family and read the Dev Diary for Legacy, I am wholly impressed by the Developer of the series and wish him unbridled success with this and future endeavours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HonkH0nk/recommended/398170/","HonkH0nk","Highly Unregulated Bullshit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HonkH0nk/","33 products in account","EVOCHRON LEGACY REVIEW\n1. Graphics\n- Not the best, not the worst. Cutting edge graphics do not a game make, however. But if it bothers you so much, there are also mods out there that lets you fiddle with the options, shaders, etc. so if the graphics don't cut it for you, you can always go the mod route. I'd also like to add that EL's modding community is very much active.\n\n2. Music\n- There are a total of 5 tracks in the Evochron Legacy OST. After a couple of hours it DOES get stale. But that's why we have our own playlists on our PCs, yes? I personally love playing EL on a Sunday morning while listening to indie music like the hippie that I secretly am.\n\n3. Cinematics\n- None to speak of as it is not needed (in this context).\n\n4. Story\n- YOU create the story. Your story ends where your imagination runs dry. :)\n\n5. Content\n- The best part of the game. The tutorial alone (which takes roughly 2 hours to accomplish) is not enough to teach you the very basics of traversing and thriving in the Evoverse. As most people say, it truly is a deep and technical game. So if you are the type of person who loves to mentally chomp on things, then consider Evochron Legacy as a quarter pounder. Logistics aside, there is quite a lot to explore and do in Evochron. Want to explore uncharted areas? Alrighty. Want to warp into hostile territory and pick fights? Sure thing. Want to design a monster ship and fly by yourself? Okay. Want to design a monster ship and fly with a crew? No problem. Build a city? Check. See there's a lot to do if you think about it in the long term. The game comes with an instruction manual and it is quite handy when you find yourself stuck on a particular activity.\n\n6. Controls\n- The keybindings are definitely overwhelming at first. Once you get past that though, everything is fine. Docking and maneuvering just take some getting used to. Also if you have or are planning to get a flight stick, the configuration is slightly confusing at first but it will become relatively self explanatory as you fiddle with the options.\n\n7. Community\n- The community is small enough that it isn't toxic and big enough that there are modders and people who are always willing to help in the forums. If you want to get involved with the community, I suggest joining the Evochron Discord server. If you need an invite, you can either get it from /r/evochron or you can ask any of the community members who are members of the server. However the beauty in EL's community is the fact that community participation ISN'T mandatory. So if you want to be total hermit (like me) that is completely feasible. Conversely, MP is always an option and you can drop-in anytime. You can also connect with other members and play alongside them should you wish it. My point is, you have a lot of options no matter how you prefer to play the game.\n\nIMO\n-Definitely worth it for its price. If you're in the market for a budget space sim, this is a must buy. With how good its community is and how much content there is to dig into, yes I can confidently say that this is a good game. Just don't get it if you want a game that spoon feeds you or an arcade type of game.\n\nRandom comments\nEdit: I just tried to land on the Alpha Centauri planet. It was only then that I realized that planets also have weather cycles. I was fighting against the wind. ( Bonus points to this game for details like that. )\nAlso the station owner for the Aquila city doesn't want to give me contracts because of my "reputation"... I'm not sure what I did to ♥♥♥♥ the guy off. Maybe it's because I've been making a killing selling diamonds? Dunno (Bonus points for people randomly getting mad at you)\n\nDouble Edit: I was seriously wondering why my ship wouldn't fly straight even while in outer space. Then I realized: "Oh, there's a star right beside this station" then I looked at my GVL and sure enough, there was gravitational pull. (SERIOUS bonus points to the game for this)\n\nLast Note: If you find yourself enjoying the game, do yourself a favor and get a flightstick","April 9","true","102.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Overall this is a time-consuming game with a lot of grinding to make money for that next model ship and other upgrades you'll need to be competitive. But, you'll find the time goes by smoothly and is worth the investment.\n\nInteresting flight mechanics, both in space and in atmosphere, along with some very challenging combat mechanics make this quite challenging, so you'll find that the initial effort towards making money to support your ship-buying habbits give double dividends in both cash and flight experience.\n\nMy only qualms are a lack of full controller support for those of us lacking a flight stick and a strong wish that help could be accessed in-game. (to date it's only a file in the game directory, along with the keyboard map which you'll find quite necessary).\n\nIt's a complex game and the graphics aren't demanding, but it's pretty enough and quite engaging, which means all that time flies by as fast as your ships do when zipping through jump points. The difficulty and learning curve is blunted by both tutorials and quests designed to gradually introduce you to the universe, and it is quite an extensive universe indeed with plenty to explore!\n\nSo, ultimately, I recommend you buckle up and come join in the fun!","January 24","true","186.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Explore stuff.\n\nThere's a lot to it and I can't describe it all. Yeah, the tutorial is long and the combat training isn't really something you want to remember, but... After that? Your free to do whatever you want. I didn't try the multiplayer (yet), but the singleplayer is quite beautiful to. Nobodys killing you out of nowhere, if you're not dumb enough to fly into hostile territory.\n\nOne last thing - It's a space simulator. Don't expect to fly like a jet and going with your finger on the fire button the whole time. Don't even think about jumping into an enemy squadron and battle it out. If you lack the patience to actually learn the game... Look at some videos about it on youtube.

It looked and sounded like something I would very much enjoy coming from some old space sims like TIE Fighter back in the day, Rogue Squadron, Rebel Alliance, Star Citizen, and Star Wars Galaxies.  Elite was pretty, but that's about all I could say about it.  It's quests were incredibly buggy, which was disappointing given the fact it's been out awhile.  You may wait forever for an NPC to show up for your quest, maybe they never do, and maybe they warp out soon after you find them with no chance for Interdiction.  Honestly, you do a lot of waiting in Elite.  To make matters worse, the game did not balance well.  Elite would give you quests as a Novice that forced you to face sometimes several NPCs solo, all of which were in better geared ships than you.  I may have been new to the game, but I'm no stranger to space sims, and some of those starter combat quests were impossible.  To sum up my Elite Dangerous experience:  I became incredibly frustrated with the numerous bugged quests that plauged the game and wasted my time, and the combat quests were at times horribly unbalanced.  When the quests DID work, I found myself spending way too much time either waiting on an NPC or searching the far ends of a sector for my NPC to actually appear.\n\nFast forward several months and I start hearing about Evochron Legacy from some friends who were also disappointed with Elite Dangerous.  I didn't understand why the two games are compared so often, but having played Evochron I now see why.  They have a lot of the same functions:  space combat, ship customization and upgrading, economy, quests/contracts, planetary landing and vehicles (Free in Evo), and faction control among other similarities.  With Evo I'm not getting the bugs though, everything just seems to work!  The combat is fairly balanced based on my combat level, and if I'm outnumbered I can actually recruit NPC ships into my own Fleet to assist in a contract.  You can destroy hostile space stations and build your own.  The combat is very good and realistically what you would expect with Neutonian style space phsyics.  Best of all, there's not a lot of waiting around!  I never find myself sitting at a POI just waiting for an NPC, when I start a contract I make a jump right to the quest waypoint and begin!  This game is very refreshing.  I'm constantly finding different things to do, whether it's completing contracts, or exploring uncharted space, or setting up a new space station in said uncharted space, or attempting to wrestle control of a region from the enemy faction by destroying their stations and ships, there's plenty to do.\n\nIf I had one negative thing to say about the game it's that the graphics do look dated, but their are mods you can download to improve the textures and shading, so that point is rather moot.  I've also bought into Star Citizen, and I would much rather have a lightweight game like Evochron Legacy that I can mod up, rather than turn my settings down in the hopes of making a heavy resource game work.  I have a decent system, not something I can run Star Citizen on at max settings, but it runs Evochron just fine.\n\nMajor Positive Points:\n+ Diverse contracts/quests without bugs, they just work!\n+ Great ship and weapon customization, lots of variety\n+  Not a lot of wasted time.  Unless you're exploring the far reaches of uncharted space, you can make jumps quickly to just about anywhere.\n+  Good space combat, sound phsyics with the flight model\n+  Space station/planetary city building, with seamless transitions from space to planets (No loading screens)\n+  Your actions can positively and negatively affect your faction's control of a sector/quadrant.\n+  Extremely lightweight install and not a drain on system resources.\n+  Developer actively reads the forum on the game's website.  He's helpful and actually listens to the player base, something Frontier has not done with Elite.\n\nNegatives Points:\n- Dated graphics, but these can be modded to improve your experience.\n- May be difficult to get into for someone that hasn't done space sims before.  There's a fair number of buttons/controls required, but not more so than other space sims.  There are plenty of tutorials to help explain everything.\n\n\nThat said, I strongly recommend this game if you enjoy space sims, this is a good purchase.  If you're new to space sims make sure you prepare to go through some growing pains while you learn the ropes, but once you learn the controls and how to navigate (Upgrade your Fulcrum jump drive as soon as you can!) this is a very enjoyable game.","June 5","true","62.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Although that next level is more of a smaller yet confident step, rather than a full blown leap forward. Everything and more from the previous title is here, including trading, combat, mining, exploration, in depth navigation and ship piloting systems, as well as new systems for station and city construction. Graphics are vastly improved and make ships look less like blobs of textures. It won't beat Elite Dangerous on looks anytime soon, but it surely beats it for depth and a low price. For space flight sim fans who have been wanting something a little more challenging and realistic Legacy is a no brainer, esspecially if this is your first Evochron game. That begs the question if it's worth a purchase from veterans of Mercenary. With the discount you can get if you owned Mercenary I'd say yes. And when you compare this to Elite Dangerous, this costs a fraction of what that early access title costs. And landing on planets is in the game from the start, no need to buy a ridiculous early access DLC that costs $60. Download the demo on the website first to see if the game is for you however, as the tutorial is long and very detailed. It can be hard to get past the first few hours of the game, but if you stick with it you'll be rewarded with a space sim that compares to very few titles that are currently out.","January 24","true","17.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I had to understand how it works, read the booklet entirely and ask friends how this and this worked...\n\nNow todays games, are.... 'easy'.... low learning curve, in the mean that most of space games are 'easy' to learn to play with... also, today's games, are showing of beautiful graphics, but a time being where only wires where drew, the games that time where used to suck way more game hours of today's games.\n\nHere's the point: I found this same sensation back with Evochron Legacy, a game I never heard of (shame to me, but why? There's no marketing around!!!!). Now with EL I find back a certain complexity, freedom, and FUN playing a game that throws me over 25 years back (damn that makes me old!!!!).\n\nYes, todays graphics are way better, but, the question is: does a game entertain you through its GRAPHICHS or CONTENT....? Both you'll tell me, but if you had a choice to make, pretty sure you'd chose its CONTENT, for your entertainment... and EL brings it! I played HOURS Elite Dangerous & Horizon, and at a certain degree I HAVE to admit, as big ELITE fan, that there's not much inside it (don't smash my head off!).\n\nEvochron Legacy opens just everything of interest! In Elite you don't really 'EXPLORE', here in Evochron Legacy, you have to fly around and use your eyes, where in Elite Dangerous you just bought the best scanner, hit the button and OH see there, all Planets, moons and stars of the system if any, show up..... No thanks!\n\nOf course, I lost (is it really lost?!) to go though some tutorials, but hell its worth it, and the more I read and see, the more the game just becomes interesting!\n\nSo, done for NERDS only? Maybe I'd say yes.... cause it's definitely NOT an everyone’s open public space game... it's more a space SIM.... and who says SIM, discards the word ARCADE and includes of course some knowledge to achieve.\n\nDo I recommend that game? Depends.... if you want it all done in 5 minutes, leave it! If you are like me and love the old-style games, let's say HARD and entertaining, then YES, definitely.... YES.\n\nAgain, graphics aren't the most important, even if it's all but ugly, if you're not puberty FPS frenzy, you'll enjoy it!\n\nOne man project, hell, what a MAN!!!!! *THUMBS UP*\n\n\nEDIT: just bought and sell some stuff ingame, and I'm now even able to MINE, and land on planets to sell it all..... as on stations :-) :-) Hell, the game just ROCKS!!!!! Wonder how long Star Citizen will take to finally release the final game. Also, how long will will Elite D. take to get sooo much entertainement inside?! :-) :-)\n\nCheers\n\n\nEDIT...... 4 hours later..... the more I play it, the more I love it! Might be stupid to say, but hell, I really feel as I was a kid a loooong time being discovering and playing elite ^^ Don't you? I DO!\n\nEDIT 2....... after the first 6-7 hours of gameplay, I started the Quests (the 1st one....) and just finished it! The tutorial (quests) are well done, pleasent, and you have sometimes to put some effort into it, but never you'll be lost a t a point not knowing what to do anymore. Over 13 hours now, still in love with! The community is helpfull and nice!!\n\nEDIT 3: ..... 18 hours past, and I'm still stuck in my chair, flying around, missioning around, preparing to build some stations and going out for real exploration. If I'd stop here, I'd say it was the little money worth of... but.... I WON'T STOP! :-)","February 14","true","18.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The rest has been off Steam. Anyway.)\n\nThis is the game Elite Dangerous pretends to be. Except it's pretty much feature-complete and doesn't cost anywhere near as much. Here's the breakdown:\n\nPROS\n\nNewtonian flight model\nThorough tutorial\nMultiplayer capable with true offline single-player mode\nModification-friendly\nCompetitive price tag\nVery responsive customer service\n\nCONS\n\nDated graphics\nSubpar voicework\n\nI want to start off by saying I just recently found out about Evochron altogether (and by "just recently" I mean "like a few days ago"). So this is pretty much a fresh first take, and I have to say I like what I see. The tutorial is exhaustive, which is a good thing for a space sim. Quite a bit of work has been put into the flight model and it shows, resulting in a more realistic-feeling flight model than what ED:H had been offering me. I welcomed the practice the tutorial offered.\n\nGraphics and voicework aren't on the same level as an AAA game, but this is indie so that's to be expected. The price point of $25 USD also helps matters in that regard, but it'd be nice to see the UI develop and mature. If it doesn't? I can mod it, so if it becomes a dealbreaker I can take matters into my own hands, which is a huge plus.\n\nFinally, a word on the customer service - I emailed the developer for a Steam key and got a response in six minutes. I have never had a developer respond to a request that quickly in almost 20 years of online gaming. It's refreshing.\n\nAll told, I recommend spending $25 on this easily, especially if you're waiting for Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen to finish releasing pieces of their games. You've probably got the money to burn if you're playing those games anyway.","January 26","true","0.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

I never found the gameplay that immersive, but it was always good to kill a couple of hours when nothing else was entertaining.\n\nThe latest installment abandons that.\n\nI bought the game largely for the visual updates, and partly to support the developer, who has done amazing work in creating these games, but i have to say i found this one a disappointment, perhaps/almost to the point of regretting buying it. While the basic controls are the same, the game itself is very much not, from little niggles like "you can no longer safely engage jump from inside a station" (Load last save or accept failure and exit?) to more prominent stuff like "the entire game economy now functions differently, so all you have learned of the franchise thus far is no longer useful"\n\nThe mission format always struck me as an interesting introduction to the games mechanics, and later, as a diversion from the games primary play of exploration and/or space combat - being a way to reliably engage in the latter in a relatively safe manner - but this version makes it both central and absolutely required. There is basically no other way (that i have yet found) to qquickly, reliably, and easily make money to fit out your ship and progress to the parts of the game you probably bought it for.\n\nWhat'smore, it is a LOT grindier. The most lucrative missions almost always take place in/around planetary atmospheres now, and though the speed unit has basically been doubled over Mercenaries, you sure won't feel it when trying to fly around a planet. Never mind that flashy wing system, spacecraft will burn up if they even approach the sound barrier. The most seductive missions - collect 5 samples of aerial creatures for study - appear to pay for a minimal amount of work, but in actuality you could easily spend a half hour fruitlessly chugging around the planetary surface at what feels like crawling speed, attempting to find the wretched things. And if you accidentally collect a unit of biological material from some other source (the trees sparsely littering the planet) you are going to have to destroy that stack and start over.\n\nI really want to like this game but unless there's some hidden mechanic not apparent to a casual player, I just don't think i can.","March 19","false","7.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lumizeal/recommended/398170/","lumizeal","Luminaire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lumizeal/","292 products in account","Where to begin.. First.. This game sounded like a wonderful taste for something I've been craving for a long time. A simple 3d space empire/fleet builder game..\n\nHowever.. while I suspect that's possible, there are too many other factors that kept making me want to red this game.. Far more than made me want to blue it..\n\nThe first real issue in gameplay that i faced, was the controls required to play this.  At first it felt like i needed three hands, which was resolved to a point by switching my controls around, but that didn't actually resolve the issue, when i discovered that Infact needed 4 hands. I didn't really feel like learning how to play games with my feet, so i did what i could.. Which wasn't enough.\n\n\nThe second issue I ran into was the impossibility of evading enemy gunfire. WHile the game does make it a point that "This is very possible, it just requires skill!" They don't emphasize enough, "SKILL, and 4 hands!"\n\nThe first, being nothing you have early on in the game, where your shields are made of cotton candy, your hull is made of paper mache, and the moment you get targetted by an enemy, it's time to reload the game, because there is no getting away. They have 100% accuracy so long as you're in range, regardless of how you're throwing your keyboard and mouse around trying to evade... Oh. Did i mention reloading -after- you get blown up? You will only survive about 2 seconds of gunfire, if you're lucky.\n\nWhile you seem to only have about 2 seconds to fire your weapons before you run out of energy, Enemy AI's seem to be able to fire indefinately without ever running out of power. That 2 seconds isn't enough for you to get into even light hull damage of the enemy ship, but it's certainly enough time for them to destroy you.\n\nFlying is a nightmare. Your thrusters, while having a high maximum speed, do not seem to provide much any thrust at all. Flying the smallest of fighter ships feels like you're flying a battleship with too few thrusters. You drift... and drift.. and drift, all the while trying to get yourself to go forward once you've turned around. Dogfighting simply doesn't work in this game.\n\nThen there are the missions.. The few mission options that seem to have less than a 50% chance of not bugging out. Where ships that are supposed to be at a navpoint end up not being there.. Where the mission can drift on for 40 minutes without any flags being triggered for neither progress nor completion.. Where the mission just simply doesn't even exist at the navpoint..\n\nOne final thing to note, that, while I don't really hold this against the game as a game in order to pass judgement, is that you appear to be stuck with smallcraft ships only. I got this game hoping I could eventually fly a capital-class ship, but this does not seem to be a thing.\n\nBut, regardless of all those negatives, i do have a couple positive things to say about this game. First, the game is rather small in size, though admittedly, I feel like this is due to a lack of assets. The model range is very small, there's nothing super amazing about the textures. It is however a rather simple game. I am not sure it was meant to be much larger.\n\nI would say that with some adjusting in both flight mechanics, the removal of the 99% hit rate of weaponfire, and replacing the paper hull with space worthy material, this could by itself be a decent game. But as things are, I cannot recommend this to anyone as a great game, especially for the pricetag.\n\nYou won't enjoy this game if you like dogfighting..\nYou won't enjoy this game if you like flying large ships.\nYou -may- however enjoy this game if you have 4 hands, and do not care about the above two..\n\nFun game for a few hours, but the complications were too much for me to enjoy further than that.","March 27","false","7.7"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","11","22","4","9"

Oh and speaking of gates...ships always crashing into you as you either entering or exiting gate.\n\nBuild Constructor for building stations - Absolute crap...build something in the wrong place...yeah screwed can't move it or even remove it..Modules don't even need be connected.\n\nShip Modules...It's ok but...kinda boring and not enough explaination.\n\nNot enough explaination or direction of the whole game seeing as it has been around 16 years beginning with Star Wraith / Arvoch Series in year 2000.\n\nAnd in closing - it is worth the 24.99USD price tag just for the flight sim...but it probably won't hold anyone's interest for long enough to build a universe...Even the public Multiplayer servers are empty of players.","March 6","true","33.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

While they had their original games around 2005, I was playing titles like X3.  I stumbled upon this game while browsing XRebirth forums.  Not a fan of XRebirth either, that game sucks too.\nThere is a lot of good about this game, truly.  I would almost recommend it because it is a solid space flight game.  It certainly flies better than XRebirth.  You can also customize your own ship.  The combat isn't too bad, in fact, it is pretty damn good.  You can also fly into planet atmospheres.  The game has a lot of potential, and that's where it ends.\n\nLike I said, this developer has been making space games for over a decade.  The graphics are about as antiquated as they were in 2005.  The station designs are terrible.  The UI is like something from a 1990's DOS game.  The universe is big, and the exploration can be fun, however, there is a whole lot of absolutely nothing out there.  I realize that's how space is, but even in sectors that should have stuff, they repeat the same clusters of crap over and over, and it is very boring.\n\nTrade stations are pointless.  The wares don't make sense, they just randomly are there.  Market values are random too, but change when you buy and sell goods at the station you deal with.  Finding components you want on your ship can be challenging too.  It's random that a station will have what you need.  So it can take time for a station to get what you want, or time for you to travel to all stations.\n\nI'd say something like, the game is in beta, or alpha, or it needs polish, but it is in full release.  It is a complete rebuild of Evochron Mercenary, literally the same universe with changed location coordinates.  I spoke with the developers about getting some leverage in modifying some game elements outside of save files, art, and UI, and it's like pulling teeth.  The radar system in the game is terrible, and the devs want to keep it that way because of game balancing issues and design limitations that would require an overhaul.\n\nLike I said, the game has good points to it, like muliplayer and combat.  Flight is interesting, and they just about do it right.  I really felt immersed in that cockpit.  However, the UI, AI, and terrible game universe really ruined immersion for me.  I will hang on to the game just in case it becomes mod friendly in the future.","April 27","false","19.6"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","2"

You will seriously spend 2 hours just learning how to fly and move your ship around. By the time you get to weapons tutorials and other aspects it will be too late for a refund. Don't let yourself waste that much time.\n\nThe glowing reviews of this game made it sound like the space game we all have been looking for. Sadly it's not.\n\nWhile I can see the appeal of having complete control of a ships systems it just makes for tedious gameplay. If you enjoy "realistic" space flight maybe you'll enjoy this.\n\nLaunching the tutorials you sit through a minute of nothing happening while your ship makes little noises and "powers up" to prepare you for tutorials. Seriously, you have to look at the inside walls of a station before even starting the tutorial.\n\nThe tutorials themselves are just bad. Even the most basic functions are made over complex.\n\nThe map is horrible.\n\nGood God why am I wasting more time on this game by writing a review?\n\nHopefully so you don't have to.","April 9","false","1.9"," 6 of 24 people (25%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","25","6","24","3","3"

Cannot recommend.\n\nThe game does not feel complete, at all, for a 1.0 release.  More importantly, the community itself is questionable and negatively impacts the experience.\n\nA friend and I, while live streaming to a couple dozen space nerds, took it upon ourselves to dive into this title and were completely ignored in server chats.  We were threatened with kicks and bans for not learning the game or completing contracts quickly enough all while our pleas for assistance to help us not slow down other players were ignored in chat.\n\nI would have liked to put  in more time and potentially have moved to a private server for continued live-streaming and learning of this game and wish I could have in order to potentially release a more in-depth or fair review, however, after sitting on it a couple days following the incident, I've opped to refund the title which means I cannot continue to put in more time.\n\nUnforunately, when multiplayer is a selling point it makes the community itself a component of the game and when these are the experiences had by new players I cannot recommend the game.","January 21","false","1.4"," 17 of 51 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","17","51","2","12"

Also the I could not get my head around how mid 1990's the graphics were.  For this amount of money I would expect they to be at least an option for better graphics.  Yes I agree I did not give the game a chance but instead of going over the 2hrs and not being able to get my money back.  I got it back instead and purchased x3 instead which yes it has flaws but pretty much sound like the same game but better UI and graphics.  Fanboys will slate me I know but this is my impression and thoughts on this game.

I don't usually go through tutorials but I haven't played a space simulator in a while so I went for it. I'm glad I did. This game has a lot of controls to it that I would have been lost to had I not gone throught the tutorial. A little too much actually. This game has a vast area with a good amount of complexity, which makes sense because its space. You could get lost in this game very easily., which is why I'm not the biggest fan. It take forever for me to get anywhere even with the jump drive. It makes me reluctant to play again when I know it'll take me hours to do something. I'm not sure if this game had a predecessor but thats how it looped from the other reviews.

I remember when WING COMMANDER pushed the technolog envelope. I built a 386 33mHZ computer so I could play the original DOOM. I am an old time gamer. Having said that, I play BATTLEFIELD 4 and other modern games, mostly on PS4. I am eagerly looking forward to NO MAN'S SKY, and I was looking for something to tide me over until it comes out.\n\nI say all that because it will explain why I love this game. I tried ELITE DANGEROUS first because I played the original ELITE...way back. I loved it. Very hard but very fun. I tried ED but could not get the sound to work on my Windows 10 computer. I got it to work on my MacBook Pro, but it's 4 years old, and my Windows 10 computer is not even a year old and much better for games. I did not want to be stuck playing on my Mac, but I have 90 minutes to see...and I am impressed with ED's graphics and the whole look of it. I was not impressed but how much grinding would have to be done.\n\nSo then I tried EVOCHRON LEGACY. I have never tried an Evochron game before. I read that it had not as good graphics compared to almost everything else out there, and there was tons to read! Like 100+ pages of tutorial screens just to figure out how to do the basics. The menus are old school. Tons of texts and crazy detailed menus. Not as slick as ED, but  more my style. I like it. I did the training, started the first quest, and have fallen in love with EL. It is a true open sandbox in which you can do anything, and you can fly around a planet or land on a planet. You can even build a station on land or in space! Very cool. I returned ED and am keeping EL.\n\nIn summary, this is a space craft simulator just like there are flight simulators. Inertial drive. Coordinate navigation. It's like you are Starlord, for real. I love it. The graphics are not as beautiful as ED, but it's more fun. And it's only $25 once, not $60 per year for the half-baked experience of ED.","June 6","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
