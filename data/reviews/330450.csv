Basically the player and opponent will alternate between offensive and defensive, while drawing simple lines to increasing complicated patterns and/or combinations of them to produce combos in a limited time frame. The lines/patterns drawn will determine the type of elemental attacks or blocks made on the opponent, sort of like rock/scissors/paper, as certain elements can be used to counter certain other elements (eg. water > fire). Involves a certain amount of memory and reaction speed to effectively attack/defend. I would hope to see more features as this game progresses, maybe more RPG-ish with items and equipments.","January 9, 2015","true","2.7"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","1"

Secret rune combos\n2. Good texture\n3. Cheap game\n\nCons:\n1. Can't save progress well, each time after startup game dont save last defeated druid\n2. You can use rune system in middle of battle and easy counter spells - game don't require much skill\n3. Very very short champaign - for me it lasted about 50 minutes\n4. You can just spam any spell and win fights easily\n5. All spells can't be countered, if enemy cast spell in last second you don't have time to counter it\n6. Spells need to be drawn accurately and you don't have enough time for some complicated combos\n\nGame is just "spell" system from my favorite game called "Arx Fatalis"\n\nFor me 3/10","January 26, 2015","false","11.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EvilLost/recommended/330450/","EvilLost","EvilLost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EvilLost/","626 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA very simplistic mobile-like game (swipe actions only) with a nonexistant "multiplayer" (possibly due to EA?)\n\nNOTE: This game might actually make for a decent mobile game (assuming it had a multiplayer base) but on steam? No thanks.\n\nPROS:\n-Simple concept (its basically rock paper scissors except you have to memorize a bunch of shapes)\n\nNEUTRAL:\n-Nonexistant multiplayer base (this is EA, so I can't really knock the game for not having players yet)\n\nCONS:\n-Unnecessarily overcomplicated Swipe controls only\n-No apparent connection between swipe commands and the results (brute force memorization or incessantly referring to the ingame mapping required)\n-Looks exactly like a Mobile game (but it doesn't seem to be one...???)\n\nThe premise of the game is simple:  You take turns attacking/defending by creating runes to attack your opponent (or create "counter" runes to block). You swipe in directions to create the specfic runes (for example, right to left to make water, down to up to make fire). Thats the sum of the gameplay.\n\nThe "swipe" system is unnecessarily overcomplicating the rune input system and aside from causing the player to simply memorize then, there is no apparent purpose for this design.\n\nIf we simply had a keypress for the various commands, the game would be exactly the same (and clearly dull), except without its "pretty" makeup.\n\nPass.","January 13, 2015","false","0.2"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

The game is glitchy as hell and only has ~8 levels in it (all of which are just the same fight, only slightly more difficult). Seriously, unless you've never played any other games before this, avoid it and spend your precious time elsewhere.","May 3, 2015","false","1.6"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","14","26","4","0"

Ive played 2-3 battles not so bad but also its nothing to be thrilled about. Some kind of FPS on moves. Its all about runes, magic and fat beardy characthers. Ive got it for free and thats the only way I recommend this game. I would never spend money on something like this. Only if they made it available as a android/iphone/wp8.1 port cuz it would be much better to see it on phones or tablets and play it on touchscreen.","April 26, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"
