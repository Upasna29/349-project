For the most part, i think someone should be able to judge how they are going to feel about a game based on the general description of the game and its overall reception. Most people, i think (including myself), even if they look at reviews, go into the reviews with a certain disposition towards the game one way or another and tend to discount the reviews that dont already side with their own pre-formed opinions.\n\nThis game is uniquly special though.\n\nAs there are not a lot of good, modern text based games these days, at least that i know of, i feel the need to review Sabres of Infinity.\n\nThis might be one of the best games i have ever played.\nIf Sabres of Infinity was 19.99, i would tell every one of my friends to buy it.\nThere are plenty of books that cost 10-20 dollars, and this is essentially an amazing book that you get to be a part of.\nThe writing is amazing, and while i usually hate games that force me to play as a specific person (i love to create my own original character) this game makes you truely feel the pressures of the role you must undertake, and it makes you enjoy it.\nIts quite a respectable length, especially for its price, and they choices you make all feel like they have weight and influence over the course of your story. I have only finished one playthrough, so im not 100% how much can change, but it seems like there are a lot of different options, and i have already seen several choices that i made that i know caused certain decisions later down the line to either succeed or fail.\n\nIf you are someone who has played games like Baulders Gate, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, Kotor 1-2 (#Bioware Fanboy) and the best part of those games was the story, dialogue, and decision making, you WILL enjoy this game. Its not quite the same as any of those, because obviously there is no "Combat" or controlling your character on a screen, but the decisions are just as real.\n\nIt is a deeply immersive and well described and drawn out world, with characters that feel real, where every choice you make feels like the most important choice of the game. For the quality of content you get, compared to the price of the game, they are basically giving this out for free, because i would pay a hell of a lot more for this game than they're asking. 10/10, Im off to buy Guns of Infinity","April 3","true","16.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aGoodServant/recommended/446310/","aGoodServant","보르케","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aGoodServant/","737 products in account","Stats at the Time of Reviewing\nHours on record: 22,0\nAchievement progress: 12/16 (75 %)\nReviewer's Note\nThis is a review of Sabres of Infinity. Due to the fact that the two, Sabres and Guns, do not come in a bundle, and that they have their own price tags, this game will be assessed completely on its own.\n\nSummary\nSabres of Infinity is a completely text-based interactive novel set in a low fantasy environment, where you take on the role as a newly recruited officer of the Royal Dragoons. The most important parts, story, writing and choices, are all very solid, and the problems few and/or minor, resulting in a strong recommendation from me at full price or on a sale/in a bundle.\n\nThe Bad\nSabres of Infinity has no proper saves; that is my biggest problem with the game. Now, it does save, but only when you exit the game. This makes it incredibly tedious to go for certain precise achievements; if you make one error, you may well have to restart the entire game in order to make it right. The only way to restart a chapter is to die, or otherwise lose, and reload the checkpoint, but if your character is too good, dying may well be impossible in that part. Now I get that this might be for the sake of immersion, but really, if immersion is so important, there should not be any checkpoints either.\n\nThe So-so\nThe stats are quite imbalanced. There are ways to play with all stats, but some are a lot easier to come across than others. For example, if you make Charisma your lowest stat at the start of the game, you will never be able to repair it, while Soldiering is easy to increase, even if you choose it as your lowest in the beginning. Certain play styles are definitely favoured by the game, but then, the purpose is role playing, not necessarily creating an über soldier, so the game kind of gets away with it.\n\nIf you are not importing your soldier to Guns of Infinity, the age of 30 is also superior in every way to start with, as no problems with old age present themselves in this title, which is a bit of a problem.\n\nAnother small thing is that many achievements are hidden, with little to go by as to how to unlock them, and some are quite specific. Information surrounding the game is also essentially non-existent on the internet, which leads to you having to trial and error your way through the whole thing over and over again to unlock them, which is not something everyone will like.\n\nThe Good\nThe story is engaging and well-written. You do not play as an unstoppable hero of legend, not even one who has control over magic; you play as a more 'normal' officer, above the common soldiers, but below a whole lot of superiors. This means that you do not always have full control; in fact, it is quite rare that you, yourself, are the one to plan and execute and engagement entirely; you mostly play the role of someone following someone else's plans, while adding your own flare to them. This makes it feel more authentic and alive compared to a story where you are almighty.\n\nThe writing itself is solid, with often eloquent language and few grammatical errors. There are errors, but most of them are only obvious to people who are obsessed with grammar, such as Latin students.\n\nFinally, the most important part: The choices. They are what the game relies on to supply the player with sufficient replayability, and they deliver, though not in the way you might expect. You cannot change the whole outcome of the war in Sabres of Infinity, but this makes a lot of sense, as you are not the one with the real power to decide. Instead of choosing what happens, you choose what the results of the events are, to a greater or lesser extent. There are sufficient numbers of choices for the various stats (Soldiering, Charisma and Intellect), and some choices include other factors, for example the stats of your troops, or whether or not you have a special rune gun. Overall, they do give sufficient replayability and are fun to play around with.\n\nThe Verdict\nSabres of Infinity gets a full recommendation from me at full price or any lower price. It definitely has enough to offer to justify the small price tag, and is overall a very solid interactive novel.","May 11","true","21.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is a game such I've not seen since the 1980s, text only, no graphics, just a story with many options.\n\nHowever, said story is very good, and genuine choices you make effect the outcome later. This is not a game for someone who doesn't like to read or to get into military details. However, if you liked Sharpe, Hornblower or other such adventure war stories of that era this will go well for you.\n\nThe biggest downside is the lack of a proper save system - play this all in one go as there's little option to go back unless you die.\n\nOverall, very satisfying for its low price.

And some choices seem to be mandatory to prevent an early end, however much some do not make sense to me that I will avoid mentioning due to spoilers. The biggest complaint I have is the consistent negative nature before your character, although I enjoy bleak scenarios and the idea of a steady climb up the ladder of command, nonetheless your gallantry seems to be all but ignored at most points.

The writing is superb, but I often feel like a very passive observer who doesn't really do anything other than to watch other characters doing their stuff. I don't play CYOA to be a passive spectator, I have novels for that. I play CYOA to be an active participant in a dynamic world, where I can truly immerse myself into the character and make choices that I want to make. Sadly, this game fails to deliver that.","March 31","false","22.2"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"
