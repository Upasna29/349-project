It's 1899 in the land of the oil obsessed and it's time for you to get your share of the moolah coming out of this thriving industry. Start small, with four competitors and the most basic equipment and gradually work your way through the ranks, unlocking new equipment/upgrades as you go in order to out-grow the other businesses and eventually buy enough shares in the town to become its owner/new mayor.\n\nI first played and reviewed this game in July of 2015, one month after its Early Access release. What I found was a good start to the game but there was only the first area of the campaign available and roughly two hours of game time to be had. In the months since then Turmoil has improved massively thanks to the hard work of the developers and the game now is as good as I would expect it to be at full release. My original review rated the game as ‘Worth Purchasing on Sale’.\n\nPresentation\nIt’s safe to say Turmoil is one hell of a good looking game. The art style is incredibly simple yet very easy on the eye and the models in the game all look great and remain consistent with the overall style. The UI is very good and while I do feel as though it’s a little bit too big when you’re actually in the drilling portion of the game it doesn’t block anything and so its size isn’t much of an issue.\n\nGameplay\nYou begin each level by bidding on a plot of land, once you've acquired land you're given $2000 out of however much you have to start your oil venture. To find oil you send out dowsers (other methods are unlocked later) who will seek out oil for you, then you simply place a drill and put pipes down to wherever the oil is. You buy horse drawn carts to ferry your oil to one of two businesses or both though it's best to send all your oil to whichever gives you the best price per unit. Should you not be happy with the offered prices you can build oil storage units which hold a certain amount of oil, as soon as you decide to sell your oil again your horse drawn carts will take the oil from storage to whichever oil company you wish to sell to.\n\nAs I mentioned there are upgrades as well as new equipment to be unlocked as you progress. There’s at least one upgrade for every aspect of your drilling business from increased drill speed to faster dowsers. The upgrades start out relatively cheap but as you progress further in the game the new upgrades become more expensive. Some upgrades have multiple levels and the price for the next upgrade is always more than the one before it.\n\nReturning to land in the game, there are four different regions for you to drill in, each one introducing a new gameplay element, I’ll remain vague with what they are to avoid any possible spoilers. The first area is the most basic and is simply seeking oil and then selling it. The second, third and fourth areas all introduce at least one thing which can either benefit you or cause you some serious monetary losses depending on how careful you are in utilising it. Obviously that’s a bit of a generalisation for the purpose of staying vague but you get the idea. If you want to know exactly what is added in each area please ask and I’ll put it in the comment section with a spoiler tag.\n\nReturning to the bidding process, as with anything, it’s a bit of a gamble. Once an area has had its oil extracted by you or one of the AI players, it’s given a rating for how much oil it has generally between twenty and fifty where fifty is a load of oil and twenty is getting you nothing but chump change. These ratings are then visible to you next time you head to a land auction. While there’s no guarantee that the next area will have a good amount of oil the areas close to each other generally have a pretty similar rating and that’s how you have to decide where you wish to place a bid. This can also be a very strategic part of the game, if you play it right it’s relatively easy to get the AI to spend ridiculous amounts of money for a plot of land but that of course comes with the risk that they won’t outbid you and you’ll be throwing your own money down the drain.\n\nThe stock auction, part of one of the game’s victory conditions, works in a very different way to the land auction. Each time you return to the town after twelve months of drilling for oil the mayor puts up a random number of shares for you to bid on. Bidding opens at the amount of money is held by the richest player and gradually decreases until either yourself or one of the AI characters decides to buy the shares for the price displayed.\n\nMiscellaneous Each area has its own environmental design and all four of them look great.\nThe soundtrack fits well with the game’s style and is pretty relaxing but the game would benefit from having a couple more tracks thrown into the mix.\nTurmoil is kind of like those ‘one more turn’ games except you often start a new level without wanting to. I found myself so drawn into the game that I found myself starting a new level even when I had decided mere moments ago to turn the game off and play something else after finishing the level I was on.\nThere’s currently no way to save and quit during a twelve month drilling period which is quite annoying, if for some reason you need to go during a drilling period you have to stop the level, massively decreasing how much money you could have earned from that level. I asked the devs if they’d be adding this and they said it’s a possibility but it would be difficult for them to implement.\nThe game needs a few things to be explained better, such as the fact that a triangle pipe connection means the pipe is drawing oil as well as the fact that pipes don’t need to lead to the bottom of an oil deposit to collect all of the oil.\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nIn its seven months of Steam Early Access, Turmoil has improved massively and become what feels like a full release title. Turmoil is a great management, tycoon game with a great art style, simple yet addicting gameplay and plenty of upgrades to keep things interesting throughout the campaign. If you’re a fan of management/tycoon games then this is definitely one worth picking up.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","January 1","true","9.1"," 76 of 81 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","76","81","2","6"

TL:DR at the end for those of you that don't like :words:\n\nLet me just say, that as a 35 yr old man I was COMPLETELY wrong about Turmoil.  I saw the graphics and I passed over Turmoil almost half a dozen times despite being 'recommend for you' over 4 times by steam.  The game is unfinished, but it's done enough that you'll have a really fun time playing it.  Most of the fixes or features that have to be finished are AI behavior, long term progression and most likely trying to make the game have a feature where you can simply continue after beating the 4 regions around the town.\n\nI'll have to admit, even though turmoil is only $10 I did my standard 'Lets watch a lets play to figure out if its REALLY worth it.'  I youtubed it and three 20 minute episodes later I had to buy it because it was driving me nuts just how inefficent the person playing the game was being.\n\nThe game seems stupidly simplistic when you look at it and the first few levels will be childs play to all but the youngest gamers (sub 10 yrs old I would say) but the town development, oil drilling upgrades and trying to cost the AI players more funds just for the sheer hell of it make the game just become a truly awesome experience for me.\n\nAnyone can dump down some prospectors, find the oil and sell it to one of the purchasing companies, and if that was all Turmoil was it would still be a good  game.  What makes it a GREAT game comes from price flucuations, being able to hold product, upgrading your infrastruture per map (rig placement, silo placement, number of carts etc) and finally your underground pipeline placement on the later maps to gather natural gas and oil in a way that really makes you able to pump up your profits (pun intended).\n\nAnd this game seems to have hit all the right buttons when it comes to being an economic game that many people would want to play.\n\n1.  Simple to learn\n2.  Complex to master\n3.  Makes you want to play 'just one more map.'  (this had me playing it the first night from 11pm when I bought it to 4am on a work night, another good sign)\n4.  The graphics, at first, seem childish but as the game progressed and the music played really grew on me enough that I was really enjoying the atmosphere after just 3 'turns'.\n5.  The sound track is actually really well done, for a $10 game I find that refreshing and a tad inspiring that the game dev's put this sorta effort into it.\n6.  You can tell this isn't just a 'lets make cash' game that many indie games seem to be these last years.  You can TELL it's been a labor of love for the developers.\n\nIf this is any indication of what the devs/game studio is capable of I'm going to write some suggestions for them and I'm going to hope like CRAZY that we'll see a Turmoil 2 within a year or two.\n\nI've played tons and tons of economic games over the past 30 years, from something as simple as Lemonade stand (back on a 386 , to as complex as EVE online and everything in between.  If I had the means, I'd love to see these guys write something with this level of care and passion as I felt when I played the orginal "Industry giant 2" or "Capitalism".  Yes, it's reaching a big, BIG bit, but I've seen a massive derth in this genre compared to seeing an endless stream of FPS clones of CoD, RTS's that can't match up to Starcraft and all sorts of studios that produce endless clone after clone while chasing the same dollars that would be theirs with a little orginalility.   Turmoil is ORGINAL and the devs haven't been stomped on by that 'corporate' mentality that screams 'shove the game out the door so we can meet payroll.'   I really, really, REALLY hope they don't lose that and their next games are just as good, if not better then this.\n\nTurmoil has been an unexpected treat for this 'old' gaming vet and I'm recommending it to anyone at all that enjoys playing economic games.  I'd go so far as to say that if Turmoil was $20 I'd still buy it after seeing the let's play I saw on Youtube.  After actually playing it I can say it's underpriced and with the winter sale screaming our way, it'll be dirt cheap shortly for those that are budget consious.  It's a budget meal at the moment and you should consider it.\n\nOh and they aren't done yet, I was reading their announcements and they aren't close to being done yet.  Oh and they are activily responding to suggestions, questions and bug reports on their steam forum page.  That's a very nice touch to me, they might not want to hear from this grizzild old vet but I have hope that they will.\n\nI always try to sum up my reviews/articles with a TL:DR, so here goes.\n\nTL:RD[/b] Do I recommend Turmoil?  After almost 5 years of games being 2x to 4x as expensive Turmoil had me playing 'just one more turn' after the first 20 minutes for a 5th of the cost.   You bet your A$$ I recommend it.","August 17, 2015","true","13.0"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","28","29","5","2"

After that it came more like grinding to unlock new areas in hope of finding more content. But after 5hrs of grinding I came to artic area and it became clear that there is no more content to be found. (Major actually comes out and says so.) At this point I felt kinda dissapointed because the game description, trailer and pricing got me believing there is something more.\n\nSo all in all the game offered me only about hour or two of entertainment and therefore I would only price it on a par with a 1$ mobile game. In my book 10 $ game should offer atleast 10 times more than that to be recommendable.\n\nNow I respect developers trying to contact players asking what's wrong and so on, that truly gives me impression that they care about their product. And if they truly care about it and add more content and features as is expected I will gladly play it again and change this review, but as of now, I cannot recommend it.\n\nImprovement suggestions to the developer:When I played this game I was instantly reminded of an old free flash game in the internet I used to play a lot when I was a kid called "Motherload". Now it is more hardcore and instead of oil you mine minerals but I find the base addictive component to be the same: you dig, and you sell profits and upgrade your equipment and you dig some more. Now in Motherload you can upgrade all kinds of equipment such as radiators, drills, engines etc. And there is lots of different options in each category. Maybe this was a bad example, anyway... =) Now in turmoil upgrades are much more limited: most of the time you don't even have new stuff to explore when you go out digging and so it becomes repeating what you did last time and it is not fun. I was expecting to be able to maybe unlock more upgrades and maybe different drills or tanks to store gas in and so on. Also every "level" is almost the same, if you see a land plant in auction that looks bigger than rest of them it's actually just as big as rest of them. You can't dig very deep, I mean I was expecting that you can move camera downwards and dig deeper with better equipment in hopes of finding more oil but also more stone and other things that make mining more expensive and dangerous. Also I hoped that you could expand the town more, build for example a tavern for yourself to give you income each year or something else to keep metagame interesting other than just stock and land auction and few upgrades. These all can be done also so that it doesn't make the game overly complicated by adding more features one by one to the game when player is advancing in the campaign so that player learns while playing.","January 4","false","6.8"," 53 of 80 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","53","80","5","14"

While there is nothing super ambitious about this title, what it sets out to do - it does quite well. The game mechanic creates an interesting strategy/puzzle aspect that can be quite addicting.\n\nEssentially you are trying to turn profits by drilling for oil. Your success is largely dependent on things such as what strategy you choose to employ to find oil and extract it out of the ground. You have options to upgrade your equipment and abilities through spending your hard-earned money. This is definately a time-based game where you will drill for oil for a set amount of time, which obviously puts more emphasis on strategy.\n\nWhat I really liked about Turmoil is that it is pretty laid-back. I sat on the couch and only played with the mouse. My wife even got interested, which is rare. Nothing is too complex here - in fact this would probably do well on mobile. I hate mobile games (as many of you know), but this has just enough complexity to transcend that genre.\n\nPros:\n+Music is fitting, and quite nice.\n+Game mechanic is simple to learn, yet takes a bit of time to master.\n+Quite addicting.\n+Price-point is definately spot-on for this title. I have no problems with the pricing.\n\nCons:\n-This would be perfect for local hot-seat versus mode. Shouldn't be terribly difficult to implement (I'm not talking online mode, mind you).\n-From looking at other reviews, mileage seems to top out somewhere between 10 and 20 hours (closer to 10). I'm fine with this, and think its appropriate, but just know this isn't going to be infinitely replayable IMHO.\n-Mouse cursor needs to be darker or have more contrast (or at least have the option). This should be an easy fix.\n\nYeah, definately a fun title to spend the weekend with. I'd recommend this at full price if it looks like your thang.","June 4","true","2.8"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","2"

Your main goal, and main problems will resolve around getting all the oil in a level out of the ground and sold within one year. It does what it does and it does it fairly well. The pipe building is intuitive(Simply drag the mouse to where you want it), and everything makes sense. Oil only flows as fast as the smallest pipe, thus you need to make sure you don't have a bottleneck in your system. And if you pump oil up faster than you can carry it away then you spill it, incurring a fine. The game explains mechanics well and there are enough upgrades and level varieties where it does not become a chore or too similar to other levels.\n\nA solid foundation, improved upon by hazards such as rocks and natural gas which can be used for profit as well, with the right upgrades, or just by adding it to your regular oil pipes so the pressure brings the oil up faster. As before, you may spill some if you bring oil up too fast, so be careful about what you drill.\nTo further the gameplay there is a solid campaign that last just long enough to be a good experience without overstaying its welcome. You need to buy the upgrades, lease land you think has a good amount of oil in it, and compete with 3 AI players trying the same. Eventually leading to auctions for shares which allow you to win the campaign once you have a majority share. Even if you are not into optimising things, the base gameplay is well enough and the game forgiving enough that you can get away with a profit just drilling for oil, though you may have difficulty making large profit margins.\n\nTurmoil is a simple but solid game, build on a good concept with good execution at a competitive price. If you're looking for a few days worth of entertainment, Turmoil is a good choice.","June 5","true","10.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

So you always expirience some kind of entertaining flow.\n\nI seldom buy relativly simple made Indy-titles (this one has only about 30MB) for almost full price ("only" 10% discount at the moment). There are regulary enough AAA-titles for this amount of money or less, but I desperatly miss the 80s-title "Oil Empire", and so I gave it a chance. Of course it is not the same, but fr me, the feeling of this game here comes close (at least for me). So I would definely say: the money was well spent.\n\nSome suggestions for further game-improvement, would be:\n\n1) A better AI during the land auctions. Of course, properties with explored rich oilfields nearby should be more attractive. But the differences on chance are not explaining, why the AI is sometimes willing to spend much more money than the competioners for a piece of land right next to it (and loosing too much hard earned money by doing so). The AI seems to extract quite at a good rate, but then spends too much money in this situation and falling back in the ranking.\n\n2) I have so far no idea, what the AI is doing outside the auctions. There seems to be no information, how the AI-competitioners are earning their money. The amount they earn, could as well be randomly generated. Or how they spend it (except for buying their piece of land). So I discovered no information about their strategies with technology and everything else. Also their little background-story is not making clear, if there are any differences in the NPC-strategies at all. I would like to have some more information about them and ...\n\n3) I would like to interact with my NPC competitioners. How about robbery, espionage, sabotage, ... Of course combined with meaningful consequences for victims (like broken pipes or leaking tanks) and caught evil-doers (like shortened extraction time because of short inprisonment and so on). This could involve strategy-aspects in town and on the region map as well as little mini-games.\n\nSo finaly, I would say: Nice game, worth the money, whith a solid core-concept in a sadly unterrepresented genre, with fitting graphics and a nice simple background-music. But also with a lot of chances, to get even better. But there is already much more, than just the infamous early-access-"potential".\n\nThanks developers! You did a very good job so far. Please keep going!","June 5, 2015","true","8.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

The goal is to make as much money as possible, as you would expect from these kinds of games.\n\nThe mechanics are simple enough. You have a town phase, where each tycoon get an opportunity to upgrade and buy new equipment, get loans from banks, and even do some underhanded business dealings, bribing prominent members of the community. Once that's set, each tycoon will bid on their plot of land, each tycoon can out bid each other, if there's a valuable plot available, adding an extra layer of competitiveness. Once all the pre planning is complete, you'll head out and start digging for oil.\n\nDigging for Oil is very simple. Just hire some dossers to find hidden plots of oil, then lay down some drills to start digging. Hire some horse and buggy to transport your oil to what ever company is paying the most. The strategy is a mix of hide and seek, as you look for more oil plots, and business management, as it requires a delicate balance of profit, time, and costs.\n\nTurmoil's visuals are definitely bright and cheery, but it does have a distinct frontier look, with an audio to match. It's of a fairly simple design, with a minimalist art design. It might not be appreciated by all gamers, but I found it to be charming.\n\nTurmoil is fairly addictive, and found there to be a decent amount of content to play through, but I did find it a bit repetitive. Each excursion plays almost exactly the same, with only your purchased upgrades making any difference. Once you find a groove, a set of actions you find most efficient, you'll be sticking to the same strategy through out the game.\n\nTurmoil overall was a pretty fun romp. A great little simulation game to break away from other main staples of the genre. Though the game can get repetitive, it does offer a decent serving for the player.\n\nPros:\n- A decent size game\n- Simple and easy to learn\n\nCons:\n- Repetitive","June 21, 2015","true","3.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","2"

This does not affect my review.~\nTags: Indie, Early Access,  Simulation, Management, Western, Strategy.\n\nOverview of the game:In Turmoil, there are 2 modes: campaign and single. In the campaign mode, you choose between 4 “tycoons” and help your character earn the most profits over a large period of time whilst drilling for oil. At the start of each round you bid competitively (starting at $1,000) on pieces of land to drill on. You get $2,000 to cover initial costs once you start. The first process is to identify where the black gold deposits are, which can be done by hiring a dowser. Once you know the general location of the oil, you can build a rig and start drilling in hopes of finding said oil deposit. Once the drilling process in underway, it is within your best interests to buy wagons to transport the oil. The wagons can either take the oil to a solo to store for later use, or to a company to sell it at a constantly fluctuating price. You are allowed a certain amount of time in each mining phase (1 yr.) and after that period is over, you will be a shown a sheet with your expenses, fees, and profit. You then go back to the town and have the option of upgrading various aspects of your equipment to increase capacity and performance.\n\nOther comments:The art style is very appealing, even with its minimalistic 2D nature.\nThe music is fitting, but repetitive. It wouldn’t hurt to add some more tracks.\nI only found a few bugs, and they were mostly cosmetic. Some text overlaps, and sometimes the wagons glitch around when they have nothing to do.\nI love all the upgrades and options available to influence your performance. You can even slip some money under the table to one of the two oil businesses for their price of oil to stay the same for an entire year.\nCompeting with your rivals for land and profits is another one of my favorite parts of this game.\nThere are varying environments, each with different challenges to overcome.\nSummary:Turmoil is an enjoyable western management game with simplistic graphics, western soundtrack, and multitudes of upgrades available to increase performance. Not being a huge fan of tycoon games or management games myself, this game pleasantly surprised me. I look forward to seeing how this game continues to develop during early access.\n\nRecommended for any fan of management or tycoon games.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/361280/\nRead the review here on our website: {LINK REMOVED}http://giveaways.pl/reviews/turmoil/\nAnd follow our curator page for more recommendations: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/vantom#curation","January 31","true","2.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","1"

Put on some nice music or a podcast you enjoy and just veg out. The campaign introduces you into the gameplay gradually—you start off simply mining oil with your only constraint being time. However each time you advance into a new stage more interesting and complex mechanics are introduced. Throughout all of this the game still manages to maintain its charming and relaxing atmosphere that made it so appealing to me in the first place.\n\nHowever if you find that being relaxed is too boring for you and would rather have a challenge then the developers recently added an expert mode that introduces specialties for each character and ramps up the difficulty.\n\nNow its not just the game that is great—the developers are also amazing people.

AI opponents are a bit of a pushover on normal difficulty but this gives you time to learn the basics of the game, which is more about holding onto your precious black gold until either Left or Right is willing to pay a decent price for it.\n\nI expected this game to be over quickly, however it surprised me by expanding on the basic concepts of the game and at the same time expanding the map. I was a bit confused about what the actual point of the whole game was, and it is not stated very clearly until you get to the last area...and even then only in the "mayors tips" section, that you have to purchase at a reasonably low fee with your hard won in game currency. I suggest players do this though- there is some invaluable advice in there that will increase your profit margins amazingly.\n\nOverall a good game, you could get through it in about 5-6 hrs or a lot less if you knew what you were doing. Not a long game but the mechanics and twangy background music make it a fun experience if you dare to part with a bit of cash.

Eatch section adds a bit more complex and fun additions to the game.\n\nThe only gripe I have would be that the end game content is lacking. But the start and middle are extreamly fun with loads of upgrades and new additions.\n\nIf you want a relaxing game that you can lay back and play, this is your game.\n\nI cant wait to see what the group has comeing next.\n\n*Eddited a few months out.\n\nWow, Its been around 5 months and the game has gotten so much better from its already good state.

The price of oil for both sellers fluctuate constantly, so knowing when to sell is just as important as knowing how much to spend on carts, rigs, and silos.\n\nIt almost seems at this point the AI cheats by knowing how to find oill, without having to spend money on upgrades, so they'll always have the most money.

The game is an oil drilling simulation game, taking place in the 19th century.  You start by bidding for a plot of land to drill on. Once you have your plot, you grab any upgrades to your equipment that you need and head out to the site to try and make your fortune.  The gameplay itself is simple to start, but takes time to fully master.  You must constantly coordinate between finding oil, bringing it out of the ground, and either storing the oil or trying to sell it for a good price.  The game has a good tutorial and slowly eases you into the game before turning you loose.  The fundamentals for the game seem solid.  However, there are a few improvements I would like to see made.  A fleshed out campaign where you create your own character and more of a story would be nice.  Also, a competive multiplayer were you could bid for land and play against your friends would be a nice addition to the game.  The game right now is playable and worth the cost.  I can only see it getting better as they add more features to the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21wiwQiy5mE","June 20, 2015","true","4.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Maybe add some gas pockets that blow up your drill rig and take out any near by horse carts. If you hit one of these gas pockets while drilling, BOOM! No drilling thru it without worry, Everything up top gets blown to bits. Something like like that. Make a person have to start all over with that drill rig. Put it so the banker comes into it more, I never had to take a loan out. Later in the game, drill sights should have stone close to the surface to make you borrow money early. Make it harder to make money, after my first mission, I at least made $30,000 on every map. Like I said, I like the game but the level of difficulty did not go up as the game progressed. The hardest part was doing the same thing over and over trying to finish it. Maybe in later levels, for a huge price you can add pipe lines right to the buyers. I liked being able to pump gas and jack up the price of oil but once that started, I was turning out $50,000 on a map. Hold all your oil till you find all the gas pockets, pump the gas in to boost the price, and run every wagon you have at that buyer. Simple, but fun. Maybe a mini game of claim jumpers?

Armed with drills, horses and silos, you must work your way across the nation to out sell your opposition.\n\nTurmoil is an oil drilling sim game set in the 19th century. You compete against 3 other npcs over land plots and drill for black gold. You have to remember though, it's 1899. So your tool set is limited. First you have to hire someone to prod around with a stick and find the oil for you. Once he finds it you place a drill on top of that spot and drill straight down to paydirt. You also have upgrades available for finding pockets of oil in the form of moles and a new fangled radar (whatever that is).\n\nOnce you start to siphon the oil from the dark depths you must purchase horses to load and unload your liquid gold. You have to min/max your way to the most profits by either selling to one of two oil companies on the left and right of your screen. Or store the oil in silos and wait for a better price. The two oil companies prices are constantly in flux. So your goal is to try and make the most of your oil. Although, you must be wary of the time. Each round takes place over the course of 12 months. So you must make sure to sell off all your oil by the end of the session otherwise you risk losing the remainder of your stock.\n\nThere's also a few other advancements, which take the form of stores. Each one provides different upgrades to make your oil hunting all the easier. From better drills and bigger pipelines to increased carrying capacity for your horses. You'll also have access to high interest loans from the local bank in case you run out of money in the middle of a round.\n\nTurmoil is a gem of a game in the early access landscape. A game with a fun core concept and plenty of room for expansion. As it sits it's worth the investment.\n\nFor more reviews on indie gaming, movies and music - EarlyAccesaMedia.com, EarlyAccessPodcast.com and YouTube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast","June 14, 2015","true","2.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","2"

I played the campaign mode and had great fun trying to get as much oil out of ground as possible in each level while avoiding spillage fines. There are many strategic decisions to be made which makes this game very interesting, and you really have to watch everything. For example, forgetting to look at the oil prices for just one minute might incur a huge opportunity cost. Also, you can choose to buy upgrades after each year of oil mining. Choosing the right ones for your next venture is very important, and some upgrades have a large effect on the way you play the game. You can also view a report after each game to see how you did, which I always really like with strategy games.\n\nI didn’t think the game was really hard, but it was certainly not too easy for the first couple of hours. After having completed the first map (there are four), I had bought all upgrades (even the overpriced, pretty useless horse counter). After that, the game got a little less interesting, as I sometimes had to wait for new oil to get visible without having much to do. Also, I got large sums of cash without things to spend it on after each year. However, I’m sure this stage of the game will get much more interesting and challenging later in development. Also, the game was still quite a bit of fun then, even in the current state.\n\nIn addition to the campaign, there’s also a single game mode, which allows you to play a single year of oil mining with all upgrades enabled. This mode even has a “share a seed” feature, so you and a friend can both play the same level to see who’s better.\n\nThe graphics of this game are very good and atmospheric. The music also brings you in the right mood, but it’s just one song for now which does get repetitive after a while. However, I’m sure more songs will be added later.\nWhile the game is still Early Access, I did not come across any game-breaking bugs. The few glitches that I experienced were minor and didn’t take away from the fun.\nI’d certainly recommend buying this game. You’ll surely get three or four hours of fun out of it right now, and future updates will make it even better. The developers also seem to listen to the community, so you will have the chance to get your own ideas into the game.\n\nI’ll end this review with some gameplay tips (please stop reading if you want to find out everything yourself):\n-	You don’t always have to build a silo. If the prices are good (about a dollar or more), you can wait a bit before building one. In the levels that take six months, you often don’t have to build a silo at all. This saves money and gives you more control over your horses.\n-	If you’re going to sell oil and have some oil in your silos, make sure there are still some horses getting oil from your rigs to avoid spillage. This is needed as selling horses will always get oil from silos first before starting to get oil from rigs.\n-	Mindlessly digging for oil is not a good strategy. Therefore, the upgrades that help you to find oil are really important. Of these upgrades, the dowser depth and speed upgrades are the most important, followed by the mole and scanner.\n-	The mole is mostly useful if you want to see if there’s oil in one tile (for example, if you want to see if it’s useful to upgrade a pipe). This is useful even if you have the scanner, as the mole also opens up some random other tiles which might contain oil. However, the scanner is faster and it’s more useful if you want to check for oil in a larger area.\n-	A dowser will walk off the screen after a while if he can’t find any oil. If you have all dowser depth upgrades, this means that you’ve found all oil (or that other dowsers have already indicated where the last pockets of oil are). Hiring any more dowsers later in the year is then useless; dowsers will even find oil in land you can’t yet see.\n-	You’ll get a small ($1000) cash bonus if you get all oil. If you sell it all as well, you’ll get $1000 more.\n-	Bribing people in the saloon can be really useful. For example, Barney will often offer to look the other way when you spill oil for quite a low price. As spillage is sometimes hard to avoid, this can be quite handy. If you often loan a lot, interest-reducing bribes are useful as well. Finally, some of the “minimum price” bribes can be useful, especially the more expensive ones that offer a price of $1 or more, as you won’t have to build silos anymore (which saves money and space, and gives you much more control over your horses). However, you will not always make a profit on these.\n-	Read the gameplay tips of the developers too; they can be found at http://steamcommunity.com/app/361280/discussions/0/618463446164943138/.","June 5, 2015","true","33.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Maybe include an upgrade that makes things cheaper to buy each year, or maybe make the upgrades permanent. for example make the horse upgrades and drill upgrades a one time purchase instead of having to purchase it again for every year, or make the upgrade cost less expensive. You should also make the plots of land have more oil as the levels get higher up. i dont know if its the same for every one, but my plots of land went from high to low as the game went on, which made it very difficult to keep up with the money standard that the other AI players have. On the 4th plot of land i got around 20k -25k at most, but on the first area of land you get to chose from, i got around 30k- 45k at most.as for an ending, The game could finish with a system that starts you off on a whole seperate map, basically restarting, but maybe different types of material to mine for or just different types of terrain.

You have an auction phase to bid for drill plots, you manage your town (which serves as equipment upgrades) and then the real time drilling begins.\nThe art style and the music aren't top-notch, but they are really comforting. They serve their purpose very well.\nThe drilling for oil is executed perfectly. Even though it's in real time, I never felt like needing a tactical pause nor did I ever feel it's too slow. The pace is incredibly well balanced. There is a faint sense of urgency, but it never gets hectical.\nThe money earned from drilling is spent on expanding your town and thus upgrading your equipment for more efficient drilling.\nSome mentioned that the game becomes repetitive soon. I was afraid of that as well, but to my surprise I haven't hit that spot yet. I don't feel like I'm going to get there any time soon.\n\nrating: 8/10","August 31, 2015","true","17.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Maybe include an upgrade that makes things cheaper to buy each year, or maybe make the upgrades permanent. for example make the horse upgrades and drill upgrades a one time purchase instead of having to purchase it again for every year, or make the upgrade cost less expensive. You should also make the plots of land have more oil as the levels get higher up. i dont know if its the same for every one, but my plots of land went from high to low as the game went on, which made it very difficult to keep up with the money standard that the other AI players have. On the 4th plot of land i got around 20k -25k at most, but on the first area of land you get to chose from, i got around 30k- 45k at most.as for an ending, The game could finish with a system that starts you off on a whole seperate map, basically restarting, but maybe different types of material to mine for or just different types of terrain. These are all vague ideas, but i think this game has a lot of potential. i look forward to future updates.","August 5, 2015","true","51.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I mean after you have found all the oil, you have fixed the market oil price so you really don't need to keep an eye on it and you are just waiting for oil to be pumped out of the ground.\n\nAnother issue is that it's brutally easy to cheat.

It would make the process of reaching the oil harder, because the only thing the player needs to think about atm, is when to sell the oil and when not to.\n\nBandits could attack and try to steal from you, requiring you to hire cowboys to protect you.\n\nYou should be able to dig deeper, way, way, way deeper than what is possible now: place small oil depots in the upper layers of the ground and force the player to dig through and down stone (gas?) and other obstacles in order to reach the  big oil depots. In addition: you should be able to scroll up and down, it is annoying you have to wait for the months to pass by before you can reach the oil depots which is outside of the screen while dowsers constantly whistles at you :P\n\nThe first map i played was overflown with oil, but the next to maps had almost nothing. It would be better if the oil varies on a single map, sp for an example 5 lands with good oil laid clustered and then lands with very little oil laid clustered aswell. would make more sense with bidding on the land, as the AI atm pays ridicules prices for the piece of land, which is closet to the town. Would be a new option of bribing, could hire someone to provide information about a few lands. It could be: between 50-80, below 60, over 50... and so on\n\nA multiplayer mode where you compete against each other. You could compete on a map with different game lengths example: 16-36 pieces of land you would have to bid on. Here there is a lot of options aswell, you could bribe to to disadvanteges  for the other players or you could hire bandits to sabotage etc.\n\nSo much potential :)!!!!","June 13, 2015","true","13.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Its the kind of game you play for a while in the train or when watching a series. It has just the right amount of stress and required activity to play relaxed but still keeps a fast action. Short rounds make you start over and develop a strategy to work quickly. The upgrades and temporaly perks give a nice change in playstyle and makes the rounds diverse.\n\nThe bidding part looked kind of strange since i never udnerstood the negative and positive part of a land. Its jsut a piece of land to me. I must have missed something in the game but that still means it wasnt explained enough.\n\nAs for the early access part; I did not really find bugs which made the game unplayable. It works, is kind of buggy sometimes, what you can exepect from an early access. Scale of 1 to 10 for early access playability I would rate this an 8\n\nI would reccomend this early access to everyone and really hope to see more content and upgrades together with a multiplayer mode!

That isn't to say that this is an overly easy game or one lacking in challenge.  Far from it, figuring out what to spend money on, upgrades versus stocks, loans versus skipping a desired plot, there's a lot of depth and challenge to this game.  There were more than a few times when I left a round having lost money, and cursing choices I'd made.  But through it all, there's this sense of calm peacefulness as you play that puts you in a relaxed spot.\n\nThe music is a perfect fit for the setting.  Western themed, yet, again a bit soft and relaxing, save maybe the last month of each round where it takes on a slightly more frentic tone, reminding you to move that oil, even if it is at a loss.\n\nThe graphics are somewhat cartoonish and a bit simplified, but it works, and works well.\n\nThere are a few things I'd like to see, like maybe game settings, more or less opponents, a difficulty slider, etc.  Also some of the upgrades get ridiculously expensive.

While the options might seem a bit overwhelming at first, the game takes you by the hand and increases its difficulty step by step. I never thought I would say this, but digging for oil in Turmoil is an addictive activity that keeps evolving as you open up new plots of land and power-ups (although not all power-ups are that interesting). If you're a fan of easy to learn strategy games, you'll definitely like the frantic oil drilling in Turmoil.","September 30, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You hire wagons to carry it to two competing businesses on either side of the screen (Left Inc. and Right Inc.) but if both of their prices aren't up to your standards, you can store your oil in silos until one or both raise their bids.  Wait too long, though, and you risk an oil spill, which causes you to be fined and lose profit.\n\nMechanics and environments are introduced slowly and thoughtfully.  While there are some errors with text spilling out of boxes, and there are some misspellings ("prary") the game itself is solid.  The music and graphics both fit the theme well.  I sat down just to give it a try and played it for three hours straight.

The mystery of where the oil pockets are, how big they are and how to most efficiently and profitably get it out of the ground is fascinating.  The music is absolutely perfect too!  Some of the upgrades seem too pricey to be useful (the diamond upgrade for moles, and moles in general, the gas valves, Etc.).  The AI seems a little lacking - I have no problem far out-earning them.  I think multiplayer would be fun - real-time or, better yet, one turn at a time kind of a play-by-email style where Steam notifies you of your turn, you play one map, and then wait to be notified your friends have played and it's time for another turn.  Not sure if I like the gas mechanics or not.  When connected to oil, it pushes the oil out at ridiculous speed and there is always a spill.  I haven't spent the 40k to use gas to increase oil prices - not even sure how that would work or how much benefit it would really be.  Consequently, I haven't really played with the mechanic to expand the gas pockets because I don't use the gas much.  Also haven't found diamonds to be worth the trouble - they should be worth more money.\n\nNot sure what to suggest for improvements - maybe mining?  Coal? Gold?  Maybe a way to collect and sell the gas?  Maybe some sort of underground gremlins that break pipes occasionally?  If mining, a cave-in perhaps?\n\nI definitely recommend this game - you'll always want to play just one more map...","January 6","true","70.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Unlocks aren't thrown at you straight away, and there's a real sense of building an empire based on performance.\n\nTo this end, the customary 'throwing all the financial information at the player after each level' is well done and actually understandable to someone without a degree in business - something that very few business management games seem to get right.\n\nIf you're sat on the fence about buying this game, or want to laugh at my awful attempts to voice a 19th century Southern belle, then check out the play-though below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qRKAJyE6NKk","January 15","true","5.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Other than a  crash on exit I found no bugs, feels as good as most 1.0 games or better, nice to see early access that is doing well.\n\nGets addicting, my first 3 hours were played in a lump when I just intended to check it out for a few min and when I looked up its 2am.   Love games that grab you hard like that.\n\nUpdated Review:\n\nAfter putting some serious work into this little time sponge I have a few more thoughts for potential buyers.\n\nThe people who are knocking it for being repetitive are not wrong, it is somewhat.

(I played the alpha version of the game a while back, hence the low hours.) The game starts off easy going, but at the later stages ends up being very challenging. (Just wait until the gas comes in to play...) Behind the simple looks is a game with lots of strategy, and truly getting everything out of your plots will push you to make split second decisions. Ofcourse the game does not have to be hard if you don\'t want it to be. If you are not a competitive person as I am the game does not force you to get the maximum out of every plot to have a good time.","June 1","true","6.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

First time I played it, I played 8 straight hours.  BUT...after that it has gotten kinda boring.  Very repetitive, and a few annoying things about the game.  Half of the drilling upgrades are absolutely useless and complete wastes of money.  There is not that much oil to begin with on any given plot of land, so having all these upgrades is pointless because you end up drilling all the available oil anyways in the default game period of 1 year.  There really doesn't seem to be any objective other than drilling, selling, upgrading.  It's obviously in early access so it will ultimately need some significant boosts in the gameplay IMO.  At the end of the day though,  it's a solid game that you can play with just the mouse, so you can kick back with your feet up on the desk and bug out for hours.  Fun game.

The tutorial is very quick, but guides you through without leaving you wondering what you're supposed to do.  There are four regions; divided into maybe 40 plots (I didn't count) meaning 10 levels to play, as each rival works on a different plot each round.  The amount of oil in each is random, but based on connecting plots - so once you've uncovered a few, you aim to choose the ones near areas where there was a good supply in the previous level, for the best chance of a playing area rich with black gold. Obviously your rivals will bid against you for what they think are the best plots, meaning sometimes taking a chance on an unexplored area or digging your heels in to try and burn through their money are both valid strategies.\n\nWhen the game starts proper; things look incredibly simple.  Each level starts with a small amount of money from your main pot, from which you must buy dowsers (who prospect for oil underneath them) and wells (from which you can start drilling) and wagons - so you can transport the oil you bring up to the surface to one of the buyers, or to a silo if the prices aren't high enough. Oil supplies are limited but so is time to extract - with bonuses on offer for quitting the level early having extracted and sold all of the available product. Sell your oil to buy more of the tools, but save some money for profit to take into the next level - whatever you do, don't spill any because the fines are heavy.\n\nFor a game that's basically dragging and dropping pipes - there's a lot on screen to look at and do, and it's incredibly addictive.  Two days after buying, and I finished the campaign as the winner - only to find out I'm now invited to play expert mode against smarter competitors with special powers.\n\nAll in all, a great distraction and one you'll definitely be able to play over and again thanks to its randomly generated levels and it's expert mode - but to nitpick; there should be a way to enter your own character name, high score tables for the levels and for the campaign as a whole so that you can check how well you're doing against previous plays.\n\n\n\n\n","June 5","true","13.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Granite26/recommended/361280/","Granite26","Granite26","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Granite26/","94 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDrilling for oil is an interesting process, filled with high stakes risk-reward decisions in a competitive environment with never enough information when commiting your resources.  There's a lot of room for awesome gameplay in this space.  Turmoil... doesn't really deliver on it though.\n\nLocating Oil:   How it really works:\nGeologists study local surface rock formations to decide where to survey, and then analyse those surveys to determine likely spots to drill  Skill at both steps determines the value\nHow Turmoil handles it:\nPick a spot on the board at random, or near previous finds.  Hire a unit that tells you there's a deposit below a specific spot.  Infallibly, although the amount of oil is completely random.\nWhat's missing\nEven M.U.L.E. had assaying.  Geographic information is a closely guarded corporate secret, with scanning technology and the ability to put various public and proprietary data together into a useful whole to determine a good drill spot provide game play, upgrade paths, and player differentiation.\n\nLand Acquisition    How it really works:\nHigh stakes negotiations with landholders to determine lease costs.  This includes clauses such as minimum production targets, as well as land use restrictions  (can't drill near the farmhouse)\nTurmoil\nBuy land for a set rate, or 'outbid' another player by paying the current rate + X$  (remember, you're doing this largely blind.\nWhat's missing\nPlayers are currently bidding on the next property based on identical costs and perfect information.  There's no risk/reward, no 'I know something you don't' about bidding, and no 'my tech means I can get oil out of this property better than you'  Even delaying the announcement of total oil on other players land by a turn (and/or limiting that information to what they actually got) would create a more interesting bidding space.  Is that low number a sign that the other player is bad, or that there wasn't anything to find?  Did they get lucky and find all the oil early and close to the surface, or is it a good spot to drill?\n\n\nDrilling    Reality:\nComplicated process involving drilling long distances while monitoring a variety of readouts to determine the status of a drillbit 1000s of feet under the surface, including where exactly underground you are and what you're drilling through.\nTurmoil\nClick to drill your pipe to a specific location, including twists and turns\nWhat's missing\nThis one isn't so bad, although exploratory drilling could be more interesting/informative\n\nProduction    Reality\nLots of stuff comes out of the ground.  It needs to be managed, processed and routed correctly.  Wells are either pumped or naturally flowing based on positive pressure.  Should the well be produced (oil extracted) or shut in to build up pressure (for greater flow later).  Water or gas can be injected to increase pressure.  Pumped wells often burn oil or gas coming from the well to power themselves.  Lease requirements mean a certain amount of production must be maintained.\nTurmoil\nWells flow until empty, but make sure the oil is being hauled away or else it'll blow!\nWhat's missing\nRisk/Reward for maximizing a well's production, the value of production now vs. over time.\n\nSales    Reality\nThis one may be anachronistic, but in addition to price differentials, different purchasers have different quantities they'll accept on a given day.\nTurmoil\nTime management game determining which to sell to vs. cost of storage.\nWhat's missing\nI really like the cost of storage vs. sales now, except so far as it is a timed map and you've got to sell everything at the end.  That seems just silly.  Making sure the wagons go to the higher price, though, is time management in the worst way.  Anachronistic, but the cost of a pipeline (faster, cheaper movement of oil) vs trucking (or wagons) is another good decision point.\n\nShut in    Reality\nAll wells continue to produce as long as it is viable to operate them.  This involves balancing ongoing costs with the perception of a wells future profitability.  Lease requirements play into this, and there is a significant cost involved in shutting a well down.\nTurmoil\nYou have a few months to a year to drill for oil in a spot.  Regardless of your rigs, your lease is up at the end of the year, and you lose anything that's left unsold.  Risk/reward is entirely based around 'will I have time to make this back if I spend it now'\nWhat's missing\nThis is the weakest part of the game (imho).  It turns the game into a rush rush rush time management sim rather than allowing the player to focus on serious risk/reward decisions, like if I drill here, how much oil will I get, and will that be enough to pay for the drilling.  Is it worth drilling another well to maintain the lease, even if the well isn't likely to produce much?\n\n\nBasically, this is a time management game.  The risk reward decisions are all there, but they are forced by artificial and silly time limits rather than likely profits.  In addition, several opportunities to allow players to develop unique strategies (find the best oil fields,  produce the oil efficiently, manage land efficiently, etc) are missed.\n\nI'd like to see this game improve, but as long as it's leaning so heavily on time managment tropes, I'm going to stay away.\n","June 26, 2015","false","12.2"," 4 of 20 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","4","20","2","2"

It consists of hiring some guy to look for oil, then placing a oil well and hoping that you drill down deep enough to actually get the oil. then you sit there and have guys on wagons bring oil to one side of the screen or the other. I think this would be better as an iOS game, but not as a $10 Steam game.

It will fill your real life with Turmoil\n\nIt must have been designed by a team of infernal psycholgists.  This is quite possibly one of the most addicting games I've ever come across.  Despite telling myself repeatedly during the drilling section that enough was enough, it was incredibly difficult to pull myself away.  It just pulls you in and won't let go.  Only through sheer force of will, aided by a wild cry of desperation was I able to tear myself away to write this review.\n\nHowever, with all honesty, this is by far my FAVORITE GAME OF 2015.  It is extremely well polished, great to look at, and an absolute delight to play.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who loves a game that is so good, you abandon all responsibilities, relationships, work, school to just play one more round, then Turmoil is for you.  10/10","January 5","false","20.6"," 3 of 23 people (13%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","13","3","23","8","3"
