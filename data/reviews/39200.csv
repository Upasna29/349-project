Dungeon Siege 2 is one of the finest RPG games i've ever played, and do not worry, even though Steam does not make it Broken World Available, you can go over to the workshop and on guide section and you'll have an tutorial to enable it, so what you are waiting for?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/recommended/39200/","wrath-","Wrath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/","145 products in account","To start, DS was a decently cool game. Basically, it was 3D Diablo 2 with a party. The graphics were awesome and there were seamless transitions into the underground/dungeons, you only loaded initially and using teleports.\n\nHowever, this Steam release has two extremely deal-breaking drawbacks. The first is that the expansion pack is NOT INCLUDED.  Unlike games like Age of Empires 2, where they incorporated the expansion into the vanilla game itself and made an entirely new one, this game does not even include the expansion, nor is it available for purchase as DLC. Thanks to the wonderful world of licensing, it's gone forever.\n\nThe second issue is that MULTIPLAYER IS DISABLED. This is because the legacy DS2 servers were hosted by GameSpy, which no longer exists (right? I thought the spyware would make them last forever!), and it seems that GasPowered did not believe this release would not generate enough money to justify a server of their own. What this means for you is that YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO EVEN CREATE LAN GAMES. It is conceivably possible to violate the Steam EULA to replace the .exe file with an old no-cd replacement and modify your hosts to not try to check in with GameSpy, but you will still run into This Bug. [www.tunngle.net] And so far, no one has found any solution to this problem, so in all likelihood, you will be playing in single player. This is really disappointing because, at least this problem, would have been a super easy fix on GP's part.\n\nThat said, this does not make the game unplayable if you want to do single player again, or if you've never played it before, you can have the single player vanilla experience for only $6.99, which is not too bad for a game with this much content. But for me, personally, I feel it's a disappointment and false advertising.","October 12, 2014","false","1.2"," 186 of 235 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","186","235","2","7"

This ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.\n\n44+ hours put into this monster. Most of my time was recorded "offline," so really it's more like 50-70+ hours, 100+ on the outside. And guess what? I'm only halfway through Veteran difficulty after spending god-knows-how-many hours trying to get through Mercenary. And time of completetion on Mercenary? Somewhere in the ballpark of 15+ hours for me at least, because holy ♥♥♥♥ I was grinding so hard and I enjoyed every. ♥♥♥♥ing. Second. Of it. Was still a grind, but it was a very fulfilling one, I'll admit. Yes, I was trying to kill mobs so I could get this one drop that would make or break my build, but when it finally DID appear...oh man, oh MAN did I feel like everything was worth it.\n\nThat should stand as a testament as to how damn addictive this game is, which is pretty damn good. Really. DIABLO(tm) is and always will be the king of Hack n' Slash Action RPGs, but this game gives the king a run for its money.\n\nA classless, skill-tree based progression system is the star of this title, having built on the framework of the first title. Now, you can tweak your builds to your liking. Combat Mage that deals ♥♥♥♥tons of AoE damage? Go for it! Melee tank that uses greatswords for massive crits? Baby, you can do whatever you want~~! Ranged character that can snipe from halfway across the map? Yes, please! Nature Mage that can makes enemy projectiles tickle like they're nothing but feathers? Oh, darling, you know how to get my motor running~~~!\n\nHowever, be warned! Multiclassing is nigh-on impossible, so take the game's advice to heart and stick to one class. Not that you can't do it, but it's ill-advised nonetheless.\n\nAlso revamped is the town system. Instead of just being a checkpoint, you actually have a *reason* to go back to town. You can sell-off your vendor trash a *lot* easier. You can portal back to town. You can buy that one sword that gives +5 cold damage and has a chance of proccing a massive blizzard from the merchant. Sure, it's pretty bare-bones compared to other games, but gawddamn this title needed this sort of system badly.\n\nI know that a lot of Hack n' Slash Action RPGs already had this feature, and this was definitely missing from the first title. It was basically GPG realizing that they screwed up in that respect on the first title, so to see them rectify it is refreshing.\n\n\nOverall, this title is amazing. It's $6.99 USD or your regional equivalent. Don't even wait for a sale. Get it now. You owe it to yourself.","November 27, 2013","true","47.2"," 89 of 101 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","89","101","2","0"

Every now and then I run across a game that just nails its genre. The Age of Wonders series makes me feel that way for example, and more recently, Mark of the Ninja -- a game that's just an absolute pleasure to play because the makers lavished attention on it to make it a joy, and the player wants it to never come to an end.  Dungeon Siege II is one of those games.\n\nEverything that makes a fantasy action strategy game fun to play is in this game -- gorgeous artwork, evocative soundtrack, user-friendly interface, fully customizeable characters, great gear, generous loot drops, secret rooms, interesting and complicated quests, and far more gold than you could possibly need. Dungeon Siege II is like Torchlight's older brother, just as likeable but more grown up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFattestCoporateCat/recommended/39200/","TheFattestCoporateCat","CoporateFatCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFattestCoporateCat/","700 products in account","I still own the physical Deluxe Edition of this DSI & DSII and was very excited to see them reach steam so that I can access and install it no matter where I might be in the world. I have probably put roughly 3k hours or more into this game alone.\n\nI still consider this game to be one of the best action RPG's ever created. Rich story and lore, not the greatest but decent voice acting for it's time. In some ways this DSII still puts some of the newer RPG's to shame, and it is easy to see where some of todays RPG's draws it's roots from here.\n\nAt first glance the graphics look outdated, since this is not a remake of DSII, one should expect the graphics not to be top notch in comparison to today's titles. But once you zoom in to take a more detailed look at the characters, enemies, weapons, armors, & spells, it is still quite amazing. Far from the majority of cookie cutter RPG's of today DSII still stands out from the rest.\n\nDSII is full of sidequests along with it's main storyline. But best of all true individual party member customization. A choice not truly given in a lot of today's titles. When a character joins your party you are given a "suggestive" path, based on the character's background in the story. But, every character & party member has all the ability trees available to them. You are not forced to build into that characters suggested tree. You want to turn your warrior into a a dual wielding assassin but also have healing, ranged, or combat magic abilites? You can do that. Or a fire wielding combat mage with a bow? You can build that too. A party of all mages? Sure. Picked up a bowman you want to turn into a healing mage? No problem. True freedom to make the party you want. Or even go solo if you want to.\n\nThere are still many mods available for DSII out on the net, some of them giving minor changes to complete overhauls or new maps and in a few cases a whole new story and storyline. Want to beat down your enemies with an overpowered pillow? How about pots, pans, spoons & forks? Want to play as one of the enemies in the game? Grab the mods. With all the mods available out there it gives the game a very high replay value.\n\nSince the closing of gamespy, there has been no full internet accessibility. But creating a virtual LAN over the net using a 3rd party program like Hamachi or Tunngle can easily overcome this issue. And the Steam version user can connect to a retail disk user provided they are playing both the same version, example: DSII to DSII, or DSII BW to DSII BW, and same patch version (Since I own a retail copy disk I have been able to test this). If not, then you will not see each other in the LAN lobby. I would like to see cloud support in the future. (It is easiest to add the BW expansion Killa has provided in "guides" to get LAN working as it comes with the original DSII:BW launcher.)\n\nIn this review I would also like to thank Killa and everyone else that have done all the work to get the DSI & DSII expansions for steam working and making all the necessary files available. So that all who have purchased it can enjoy the complete classic Dungeon Siege experience. Since DS3 lacks everything that made DSI & DS2 such great games. Also if you enjoy the Dungeon Siege series of games give Space Siege a try, which is a spinoff of the Dungeon Siege series of games set in a fictional future. Unlike Dungeon Siege, however, items are limited much like Shadowgrounds (No relation). Also Space Siege lacks the party play style of Dungeon Siege, and I have not had a chance to test multiplayer on it (unlike DSI & II, Space Siege used GPGNet, & I have not yet had a chance to see if the service still works). But still nonetheless another great game in the Dungeon Siege realm.","December 4, 2015","true","71.2"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","33","35","0","0"

I've been hooked on Dryads for years because of her.\n\nThe game has some age on it. It's not super complicated like others that are available now, but it didn't have to be. Trying to keep your party alive in a skirmish was enough to make you wish you had a diaper on. The story was great and most of the characters where likable. The voice acting was ok.\n\nI think it's way better than the 3rd installment.\n\nThe dryad Taar had an INCREDIBLY sexy voice. Srsly. She could read a dictionary to me any time.\n\nMake sure you know where your hot key is to use potions as well as the hot key to select specific members and the whole party. Health drains fast. Even faster when a caster's mana dries up.\n\nThere are different skill levels for the game. They encouraged you to up the skill level in an interesting way. Not sure if they're the first to do it or not, but it was effective - you could have more characters in your party if you choose a higher challenge.\n\nWhich leads me to one of the greatest things about this game! The dialogue!! (Oh, and do yourself a favor and find the mod that takes care of the issue where everyone stops talking and you miss out on that part of the story if a bad guy walks up and attacks. Which happens ALL THE FREAKIN TIME!) The inter character banter is flawless. No matter what combination of characters you have or how many, they all interact naturally in conversation. They seem to develop sort of complex relationships between them. They say different things to each other depending on who's there. I've played the game through a billion times over the years and I'm constantly hearing new things.\n\nSomeone needs to make a NPC follower of Taar for Skyrim and all other sandbox games I like. WHERE IS THE FUNDING FOR THIS!?!?\n\nThe game does have a massive inventory of weapons, armor, rings, amulets, shoes, reagents, bathroom accessories, nicnacks, etc etc.. Also, look up the mod that changes the size of your stash box to 255x255 squares. There exists one to do the same with your pack mule and your own inventory. Bump up the resolution and collect some loot!\n\nIt's also a pretty long game. You're not going to beat it in a few hours. Even if you cheat via the console, it'll still take a few days. There's SO MUCH territory to cover, puzzles to solve, banter to listen to, cut scenes, missions, shopping.. The boss fights are also super long. Not that they're oppressively hard (though they can be on Legendary), they just require a lot of tactics and strategy. And the bosses have insane HP pools.\n\nGames as of late have really lost the charm this little gem has. Yeah, the graphics aren't what games have today, so don't get your hopes up if you come across a mod that makes all the girls sans clothing. Though the world does look pretty good. It also doesn't have much in the way of DLC and fortunately you don't have to bust your wallet out and type in credit card numbers every five seconds to get one item you need to progress like those lamentable "free to play" crapsterpieces.  When you enchant items, you don't need a doctorate from MIT like the spells in Lichdom.\n\nBut, you do have to be careful where you spend your skill points, lest you ruin a character. You do have to plan ahead. You do have to be quick on the keys. But most importantly, you are definitely rewarded for it all.\n\nIf you've made it this far, you prolly will buy and play the game. I'd like to leave you with one piece of advice that will save you much frustration, and it has to do with elevators:\n\nWhen you put your party on a lift to go up or down into a new area, there is one glitch in the game that will bone you. Even if you get all your characters on the platform; for whatever reason, when you trip the lever to move, one or more of your people will say "I'm out, peace!" and walk off the platform before it stars to move. Often times dumping you into a mob of baddies you simply can't beat with only half your members (or even sans one).\n\nSo here's what you do. Arrange all your peeps on the platform. Move one of them right next to the lever and use them to pull it. This way, when you go down, if there are a billion bad guys, you can use that same character to bring your party back to safety before anyone dies.\n\nIf you can't get them all to go up or down at once, and this happens, here's the strategy that I have used for years.\n\nSet everyone's AI to aggressive. Try to get your magic users to all go down. Leave the Melee and archers behind except for one (which you will keep selected and control) next to the lever. The reason why you do this, is because a melee character will run off the platform as soon as it touches down and end up toast. The magic users will stay on the platform and hit everything from a distance.\n\nKEEP A CLOSE EYE ON HEALTH!! If you're fighting low level creatures, come up once the lowest health meter is at 1/4. If you're fighting high level creatures, come up as soon as the lowest one is close to  1/2. If they're super high creatures (and this is actually a good strategy to kill them period) then go down and only say there long enough for your mages to charge their spells. They'll continue to pelt the baddies as you're coming back up. While you're in your safe zone, use that time to heal and let your mana recharge.\n\nLove and cherish Taar. She is the soul and conscience of your group.","January 25, 2015","true","0.3"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","79","30","38","15","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/39200/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Dungeon Siege is a series of action-RPG, where every chapter feels very distinct from others. You can see the evolution, but there are so much diversity, that people who like DS1 may be strongly against DS2, DS2 fans might be opposing DS1 and DS3... At least, it is not that hot, as "apple vs. droid" holywar now.\nDungeon Siege II made much to expand all that was good in the DS I - the system of characters development, interesting setting of fallen and reshaping empires - just like from known history, only with magic, demons and angels... To add pathos and glory, you know.\n\nIn addition to DS I formula "take x levels with the skill - do y damage with that skill" there was added perks - to enhance the benefits of choosing one specific path (class) rather than do them all but just on the average level (still, multiclass with some magic is better than pure melee).\nWhile the first Dungeon Siege was quite straight forward with only the very little need for backtracking, the expansion of DS II added BOTH the variety and size of different locations AND the need to go back-and-forth on the same landscape. While there exists a system of teleports for quick-travel, just the need to return to the base or some previous location every now and then feels very distinct in comparison both with the DS 1 and DS 3.\n\nWhat good do I see in the game?\nFirst, the developers made some work with the level design, to the point where dungeons and paths between them are not looking like intestines - like it was with DS 1 and many other similar games.\nSecond, while the story lost more of the previous "abandoned (Roman) legion" lore, it become more original. Now it's the tale about power-obsessed meglomaniac and some wannabe mercenary, who unintentionally gets in the way of the "New World Order". On his way to make some score with the bad guy, our hero-by-chance will be loosing and gaining friends, step-by-step evolving into rebellion leader. Sounds epic, right?\n\nOther than story, good level design with bad constant backtracking quests (and some good quests thereto), and somewhat original (at its time) character grading system... I have to say that the game is quite dated. And even back in time when it looked good, it wasn't the brightest star even between so-called "Diablo-killing" action RPGs. Not to mention more pure RPGs like Bioware stuff... There are some nice little things - like the spells to make looting more easy work - but they can't outweigh the main issues, like the general fun-out-of-the-game (which can't be measured, but can be compared).\n\nAs a summary, game's not a bad one. It's decent, like 7/10 in my book. But would I recommend it to the new players? Hardly. If you have desire for old-school gaming, find the real brilliants, like early Bioware products, Divine Divinity or Arcanum - don't start with "somewhat original" copycats, unless you want to grow a dislikeness to old games in yourself.","April 18","true","161.1"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","1"

I have bought so many games where I have either returned them for a refund or played once and never bothered again.  This is the 1st game since Football Manager that has the potential to cost me a divorce as football manager nearly did.  Bye bye wife.  Hello Dungeon Siege 2.  The game is just brilliant.  Yes the graphics are dated and yes there is aot to get your head around but it is so much fun.  Unlike other games in the genre like Torchlight you dont just get given loads of loot.  Yes there is still plenty but it feels so much more rewarding to get new weapons.  For example I had a 2 handed hammer that I couldn't use until I hit melee lv 5 and unlocked a certain skill from the skill tree usinf skill points.  Once I met this criteria it was so satisfying to equipt my new hammer and smash everything up with it.  On other similar titles in this genre you just seem to get given weapons or there are too many weapons.  This game puts them to shame.  I love the story as well.\n\nOn a final note as well this game is an excellent way of losing weight in the same way football manager was when it owned my life.  Normally I just eat and eat and eat but I have played this for the last 7 hours solid and never thought of food once.

I've been playing games for 25+ years and this is one of my favorites. The stats on weapon drops from the drops is fun to compare, the fights are fun, you can pause the game to switch party members and switch weapons/spells/etc. by pushing the space bar which is really fun for strategizing, the game doesn't feel linear because you can explore out a bit and there are side quests. The story is nice. The cities are cool. There is an elf city which has a lift to get up which is pretty cool as well; really enjoying this one. I'd give this 9/10. The graphics are still decent, but it's the gameplay that makes this one shine.\n\nIf your trying to pick one Dungeon Siege game I'd go with 2, followed by the first one, and then the Dungeon Siege III.","January 1, 2014","true","21.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now there is a single player replayability target. In order to really complete the game, it is necessary to finish it at least 3 times using the same character, due to the XP level suggested for each difficulty level.\n\nNow it is possible to craft special items, instead of waiting for them to appear as loot, there are special powers that can be used sometimes during battles. The inventory part suffered some small changes, but keeps almost the same as the first game. The main change in character development is that now it is possible to improve some type of ability as you level up.\n\nFor fans of the first game it is as good as that one. unfortunately, as DS1, DS2 steam version does not include the Broken World expansion, but even like this there will be many hours of play time.","May 25, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You don't have to play the first game to understand the story (which is pretty decent by the way).\n\nThe gameplay: It's similar to that of the Diablo series, it's point and click movement/combat, except that you can control a party of up to 6 characters (it's easier then it sounds). You can set each character to automatically perform a certain attack or spell. So the only character you have to actually worry about controlling is the one you choose to select as the leader. You gain skill points that you can spend on certain active and passive skills: shield block, less mana consumption for casting spells, dual wield extra damage, etc. The active skills you earn are based on what passive skills you choose. Example: by investing skill points into the passive skill "increase cold spell damage" you earn an active skill that blasts several shards of ice that do massive damage.\n\nAdding the skill point system really improved the oversimplicity of the first Dungeon Siege leveling and combat system (don't get me wrong though, the first one was still fun too). Another addition, is that you can enchant items by finding or buying certain ingredients. You can make some really powerful armor/weapons.

In my opinion the other games are not quite as good though they have individual strengths.\n\nDS2 has an evil Prince that steals a powerful artifact to become as per usual a God,  and your job, along with your party members is to geld the upstart! The game has a lot of gameplay substance even if it is by 2014 somewhat generic in nature. The story is rather shallow as well but what can be expected...this isn't even vaguely on the level of say...one of the Malazan Book of the Fallen novels (Steve please encourage someone to do a Malazan game..Memories of Ice would be a great one to do!).\n\nI think for its price DS2 is pretty decent in its capacity to entertain and I would recommend it.

In my opinion the other games are not quite as good though they have individual strengths.\n\nDS2 has an evil Prince that steals a powerful artifact to become as per usual a God,  and your job, along with your party members is to geld the upstart! The game has a lot of gameplay substance even if it is by 2014 somewhat generic in nature. The story is rather shallow as well but what can be expected...this isn't even vaguely on the level of say...one of the Malazan Book of the Fallen novels (Steve please encourage someone to do a Malazan game..Memories of Ice would be a great one to do!).\n\nI think for its price DS2 is pretty decent in its capacity to entertain and I would recommend it. Just don't expect too much though it is a good timekiller, generates a few laughs, and de-stresses as you mow down enemies galore!","January 22, 2014","true","63.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have had a ticket open for 2 weeks so far and the only reply I got was an automatic "check your game files" nonsense...\n\nSteam... your customer service is s**t and utter shambles...

There are two serious issues that cripple what honestly seems otherwise a reasonable game.  First is movement.  Point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, etc.  Come on, seriously?  No constant movement like Diablo of YEARS before?  No directional keys to move and attack at the same time of later games of this same era?  That's pretty terrible.  Second is your attacks/ abilities.  You have immediate access to a rich array of spells and attacks, but you can only use one at a time.  No hotkeys for spells?  You're kidding...  Nope, you have to go up to the corner to click on a little button to change to one of a select few that you have put in your ready tray, likely bumping the edge of the screen while at it which changes your camera view/rotation.  This is just a UI failure all around.  If I could hold the mouse button to move and hotkey 4 spells/attacks into the 1-4 keys to swap ablities in combat easily, I'd be all into this instead of detailing why you shouldn't bother with it.  A third issue of note is that there is VERY strong discouragement in the tutorial that you should pick an attack and stick with it, meaning melee, ranged, or spell.  Great, except for the fact that spells use mana which runs out, the other two are infinite.  Yep, infinite arrows, finite mana.  So, you CAN'T stick with spells, you MUST swap out to something else, which again isn't easy by design and starts to impact your development apparently by the warnings.  Fundamentally obvious design flaws they could have easily fixed and made this a total win.","January 3, 2015","false","3.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But it's still fun as long as breaks are taken occiasionally.\n\nI've got a friend who says this is his favorite RPG ever. I can't see why. This is by no means a bad game but there are better ones. If you've played Torchlight a dozen times, crushed all the orcs in Lord of the Rings Online, and slain the ultimate boss in FATE then this game will give you something new.\n\nThere is no 1 town you go to. No shopkeeps you keep going back to. No place you will call home for more than couple hours of gameplay. This game has you travel through countless areas as you progress down the storyline. From a dense jungle, to a barren desert, to misty mountain roads, to woodlands infested with all sorts of monsters.\n\nPros-\n-Don't stick in 1 place long enough to get bored with it\n-Loads of varied inviroments\n-A party system. And a fairly good one at that\n-Good story\n-Variety in everything from weapons to monsters to shopkeeps and towns\n\nCons-\n-Can be repetitive\n-Boring to play for hours on end\n-You have to play through the game multiple times to get a full party. You start with 4 and can get up to 6 by completing the game twice\n-Graphics have aged horribly. Like really badly. All the characters and mobs are super chunky.

Before you know it, your wizard knows martial arts. Especially later in the game, you can't let a thing slip without gaining several levels in an unwanted skill (which will slow down progress in those you want), this is the most unforgiving interface I've ever seen.\nSave yourselves some stress.","January 9, 2015","false","74.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The gameplay was easy to understand and honestly preferred it over Diabalo, graphics were pretty amazing. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game if you expect it to be similar to the first of the DS series.\nI don't know if it's just my computer (which runs games like Chivalry Medieval Warfare pretty well) or it's the game, but the textures aren't as good as you'd expect for the second game of the DS series, heck the first DS looks better and even more crisp.\nThe second thing I don't like about this game is they seem to have thrown the party options like having the whole party target the weakest or strongest enemy, being able to highlight and select all party members to regroup.\nThe next thing is more of a personal preference but I'm not a big fan of having to continuously use the right click to attack. I'm more used to the DS1 single click and let everyone do the dirty work.\nNext is the lack of game settings, there isn't a whole lot you can adjust.\nLastly (I think) everything seems so cluttered, mostly the objects in the game like crates you can't destroy followed by other nit-picking like how fat the cursor is.\n\nNow obviously I haven't spent much time ingame but to me DS2 was a disappointment in comparison to DS1 but it's all the matter of personal preference. When I think of "Dungeon Siege" I think of an idle action packed game that's simply point and click while you manage your party's health, but this game is trying to be Diablo with some differences here and there. (Diablo is a cool game, but just not my style)\n\nUnfortunately I cannot recommend the game if you've come from the DS1 world, I'd consider it as a downgrade.

Although the gameplay concept didn't change much, DS 2 presents itself more complicated and somehow contraintuitive about the controls, if you come from DS 1. I have a hard time getting started because of that and die a lot. On the other hand DS 2 presents some improvements like an arrow telling you where to go, respawning enemies and a portal system to speed up the journey and making revisits of old locations much easier. On the other hand, this assimilation to standards kind of takes away a piece of the uniqueness of the first part. If compared to other rpgs DS 2 sadly doesn't rise above mediocrity. I also have to admit that I found the graphics poorer than those of the first game. I had the impression that at least the first sceneries are grayer and somehow more practical than aesthetic. I especially disliked some of the character faces and their portraits, although they are not as important as what they have to say. Usually I am not into graphics that much and prefer the pure story, but it really stroke my eyes.\n\nI don't think that DS 2 is a total waste of time. I'm sure, if you have the time and dedication you could have lots of fun with the game, but I personally do not want to spend so many of my resources on it and I do not recommend the game for most other players, who might be frustrated with it as well.","April 7","false","1.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","5","0","0"

I remember playing the original Dungeon Siege (and Legend of Aranna) and rather enjoyed it, even though it involved a lot of pretty endless side-tracking as you go up and down hills and follow paths and attack monsters and whatnot. Turns out this is about the same thing, albeit with a bit more "heroic" story...\n\nYou play this character who was in a bad guy's mercenary unit, hit a few battles, then was captured and released to do a few good things for amends. He picks up companions for different roles such as fighter, archer, combat mage and nature mage (he himself can be any of the four).\n\nThe game is pretty simple mechanically, and while there is a ton of loot, most of which are pretty forgettable, as Dungeon Siege at its heart, is 3D Diablo. You'll find various items to improve yourself, and you will swap items trying out different "packages".\n\nThe game's graphics are horrible, but that's really no surprise for a game that came out in 2005... It was state of the art THEN, it's horrible now. Character polys are low, fighting's clunky. The fighter mechanics also changed, and not always for the better. Instead of just fight, each character now has a "super-move" that you can unlock as you gain skills. A fighter, for example, can do a shield-bash, or perhaps a two-handed sword smash-strike, that does like 10x the normal damage, if you unlock the prerequisite skills. And each skill be further improved in skill levels, with additional skills only unlock when you reach a particular combination of prior skills. This complexity, IMHO, actually made the game worse. Supermove requires recharge, but how it recharges isn't explained very well.\n\nThe world's big, but it's a single path through, with SOME side areas to explore, but not that much of it. A cave here, a building there.\n\nThe plot is pretty simple... and cliche. Bad guy is about the conquer the world, and the only guy who can save it doesn't even realize his destiny. Then there's this sudden deus ex machina twist at the end, like WTF? The end result is not nostalgia, but "Why did I think this was cool?"\n\nPlay Titan Quest or Diablo 3 instead.","November 27, 2013","false","68.1"," 2 of 27 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","2","27","0","0"

What did I learn from this? Let the past be the past, people, and let sleeping dogs lie. What was once a game that astounded me and my young, inexperienced eyes is now just a bittersweet realization of how much I have grown since when this first came out.\n\nThe world, while well thought out, is not the most aesthetically pleasing of all the games I have played. It feels chunky and square, and if you look at the face of your player, you will see why. There are too few customization options as well, though I can give it a point for letting it have the option of which gender you are.\n\nMy review will be short since I hardly played it in an effort to keep my blissful memories untainted, so I am unable to comment on the storyline and will never be able to either. Cutting it short, do I recommend this game? No. Even to old players? Especially so. New and old, stay away. There are better games. Try a newer release of Dungeon Siege. Try World of Warcraft or something, I have no idea. I just do not recommend this game.","May 6","false","0.1"," 1 of 26 people (4%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","4","1","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/surfinbird/recommended/39200/","surfinbird","SurfinBird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/surfinbird/","29 products in account","I've played a lot of action RPG's over the years, MMO's included. In terms of the action RPG category I honestly have to say Dungeon Siege 2 takes the cake as the best game ever released. The speed of play and game mechanics are perfect, especially for their time. Unlike the Diablo series, Dungeon Siege 2 takes a less of a "run and gun" approach to the game. What I mean by this is when your fighting adversaries you actually have to stop and put up a fight. Those who have played Diablo know that if you're playing in a big party you pretty much never stop running while mowing down enemies in the process. I prefer the Dungeon Siege approach because it feels more like a role playing adventure, which is what I am looking for. As for the mechanics, they nailed it. The loot is always great, there are tons of different items, magical, unique etc. There isn't really any one thing about the game that I can honestly pick apart and say "I really wish they had done that". Every good aspect of action RPG's is contained in this game and the bad left out. And the storytelling? Second to none.\n\nGraphically this game is 10 years old now from me writing this review. That said, in the year 2005 3d graphics were certainly nothing new. If graphics factor heavily into your purchasing of a game, this game will probably never live up. But it still looks pretty good. The environments are very beautiful, and the team who made this game definitely took their time putting work into every little detail.\n\nThe last thing I will say is when you buy this game.. it comes with glitches. If you have a windows 7/8 computer you have to download some direct x patches (from the microsoft website), setup some commands to enable widescreen, and also I had to do something to get the mouse to appear. If you want to play multiplayer it is disabled, but there is a workaround possible, and you can play with friends from around the world by setting up a virtual server. If you can figure out all these things you can get the game to work as it was originally intended in all it's glory.\n\nMy rating of this game 9/10 :)","February 25, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Teleporters connect the entire world, promoting revisits as you unlock means to interact with thing you couldn't before. There are clear quests now, and you have a storage safe for your items after the intro stage. Overencumbrance and lack of inventory space is a thing of the past, as you have the access to shops to sell your stuff very early. The story is smoother, better brought and told to the player, and I dare say the game in general is more immersive than the first one. It's a must play for all PC gamers; considering how old the franchise is, you could even call this a classic. And it's also conveniently cheap for the same reason.\n\nOnce you get used to the simple game mechanics, and what does what, it's very difficult not to enjoy this game. If you enjoyed the Elder Scrolls, Pokemon, and MMORPGs, you'll enjoy the Dungeon Siege franchise.\n\n(NOTE: Go into your game options and set the combat back to DS1 for it to be generally easier, until you want to implement kiting into your playstyle later on. With it on DS1, your selected character will keep attacking until whatever you're fighting is dead, instead of having to hold down the attack button for that, or clicking for each individual attack.)","February 14, 2015","true","66.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoyed the Elder Scrolls, Pokemon, and MMORPGs, you'll enjoy the Dungeon Siege franchise.\n\n(NOTE: Go into your game options and set the combat back to DS1 for it to be generally easier, until you want to implement kiting into your playstyle later on. With it on DS1, your selected character will keep attacking until whatever you're fighting is dead, instead of having to hold down the attack button for that, or clicking for each individual attack.)","February 14, 2015","true","66.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In terms of the action RPG category I honestly have to say Dungeon Siege 2 takes the cake as the best game ever released. The speed of play and game mechanics are perfect, especially for their time. Unlike the Diablo series, Dungeon Siege 2 takes a less of a "run and gun" approach to the game. What I mean by this is when your fighting adversaries you actually have to stop and put up a fight. Those who have played Diablo know that if you're playing in a big party you pretty much never stop running while mowing down enemies in the process. I prefer the Dungeon Siege approach because it feels more like a role playing adventure, which is what I am looking for. As for the mechanics, they nailed it. The loot is always great, there are tons of different items, magical, unique etc. There isn't really any one thing about the game that I can honestly pick apart and say "I really wish they had done that". Every good aspect of action RPG's is contained in this game and the bad left out. And the storytelling? Second to none.\n\nGraphically this game is 10 years old now from me writing this review. That said, in the year 2005 3d graphics were certainly nothing new. If graphics factor heavily into your purchasing of a game, this game will probably never live up. But it still looks pretty good. The environments are very beautiful, and the team who made this game definitely took their time putting work into every little detail.\n\nThe last thing I will say is when you buy this game.. it comes with glitches. If you have a windows 7/8 computer you have to download some direct x patches (from the microsoft website), setup some commands to enable widescreen, and also I had to do something to get the mouse to appear. If you want to play multiplayer it is disabled, but there is a workaround possible, and you can play with friends from around the world by setting up a virtual server. If you can figure out all these things you can get the game to work as it was originally intended in all it's glory.\n\nMy rating of this game 9/10 :)","February 25, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This feature keeps the game interesting throughout as you spec up your main starter character and have the ability to improve your other party members and try out their skill sets. The voice acting is pretty decent, and the storyline is interesting. There's a heap of side quests to do as well, and some are pretty challenging and have puzzles that you have to solve to move forward in the main quest or open a chest to find epic loot.\n\nMy only concern was toward the end-game it gets a bit grindy to reach the final boss, and replayability is good but would be better with friends as you play through game again on a harder difficulty (similar to Diablo II's difficulty levels). Boss fights are at first challenging but once you get the jist of their mechanics they are pretty easy. With the resolution configure making it 1920x1080 with v-sync, the game looks pretty decent for it's age (2005 I believe).\n\nOverall it's a classic Action RPG with interesting combat system, able to control up to 6 party members and fairly decent choices to focus your character on i.e. a Mage can focus on Fire, Lightning or Death Magic, or Summoning Skills.","December 7, 2015","true","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reminded me alot of Baldur's Gate when I first played it back in the day, with a splash of diablo. However, while the loot system is very satisfying, and the out-of combat secrets and goodies are worthwhile, the skill trees, spells, and skills in general are a little too simple for my liking, and some are completley useless while some are incredibly overpowered. The end result is too little replay value for the kind of game it is. They do let you pick your race, and you aren't locked into a class, but if you don't specialize in one of the four skill types, (Melee, Ranged, Nature, uhhh... well the fourth one is damage magic. Can't remember the name.) you will end up very underpowered as they punish you severely for trying to multiclass in this game, One very cool fact is while at the middle-to end of the game most party members are leveled up so much there really is only one way you can build them, the few you get at the beginning you can basically mold into anything you want, to work with whatever role your character fills. I won't give away all the features of this gem, but with a tiered playthrough system similar to diablo, you can carry your experience, loot, and party members (unlocking additional party slots when you reach the harder tiers) through another playthrough, making up for the "why bother" rolling a new character.

However you can just use rampage and pause to switch characters and move them)\nSteam version does not have/include DS2 expansion (Broken World)\n\nOverall this game is great and i would highly suggest anyone to get this.\n\n9/10\n\nAdd me if you have any questions about DS2","August 23, 2015","true","194.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Surprisingly modern feeling for a 10 year old game. Can be played casually, but allows for more advanced things like kiting, orb walking, animation cancelling. Items are complex enough to add depth and a good level of "spreadsheeting" (crunching numbers to identify the best gear combo's etc...), and the skill systems are pleasant and rewarding.\n\nSome classes do out-shine others (archer seems to be the strongest in Vanilla by far) but due to the game not being too difficult, you are not forced to play with the strongest - just play with whatever you want.\n\nOverall , still a great game even now. Would be nice to see a modern version - There are other dungeon crawlers out there at the moment (Diablo 3 is great) but not quite play like DSII.

This feature keeps the game interesting throughout as you spec up your main starter character and have the ability to improve your other party members and try out their skill sets. The voice acting is pretty decent, and the storyline is interesting. There's a heap of side quests to do as well, and some are pretty challenging and have puzzles that you have to solve to move forward in the main quest or open a chest to find epic loot.\n\nMy only concern was toward the end-game it gets a bit grindy to reach the final boss, and replayability is good but would be better with friends as you play through game again on a harder difficulty (similar to Diablo II's difficulty levels). Boss fights are at first challenging but once you get the jist of their mechanics they are pretty easy. With the resolution configure making it 1920x1080 with v-sync, the game looks pretty decent for it's age (2005 I believe).\n\nOverall it's a classic Action RPG with interesting combat system, able to control up to 6 party members and fairly decent choices to focus your character on i.e. a Mage can focus on Fire, Lightning or Death Magic, or Summoning Skills.","December 7, 2015","true","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is catchy and the team system allows you to play all the character classes at the same time and elaborate complex combat strategies. Of course, it is a bit dated so the graphics can turn you off, but if you're used to playing good old games you'll love it.\n\nThis game does not include the Broken World expansion pack, but trust me you don't need it as the extra campaign was boring and linear and the two new hybrid character classes were just irrelevant. The only sad thing is you don't get to craft unique and set items using recipes, but you'll get over it just like I did.\n\nHave fun !","November 16, 2015","true","57.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now comes the fun part, that you'll need to do each time you want to play:\n\n1. Join the tunngle DS2 Broken Sword network\n2. Disable your lan adapter, or otherwise disconnect your PC from the internet completely\n3. Run DS2 with Tunngle's play button that you configured before\n4. create a LAN game in DS2, and launch it (with only yourself)\n5. reconnect your internet access, then reconnect to Tunngle\n6. Victoly!  Others should be able to see your game and join it!\n\nIf you would like to play DS1 with the expansion, online, my review for that is similar:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Yoodiv/recommended/39190","March 6","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
