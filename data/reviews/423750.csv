It's basically a walking simulator heavily inspired by Proteus, except with uncomfortable controls.  The art is nice -- minimalist and colorful. But to say there's not much substance is an understatement. I'm not even sure that I actually 100%'d this game.\n\nOverall, it's a nice art project that's worth looking at if you're seriously in the mindstate for it. But most people might be better off to save their money. I'd have probably given it a thumbs up if it cost $1. But it's overpriced at $3-whatever.","February 28","false","0.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

If you don't want to play a game you could ostensibly finish in 20 minutes your first try, look elsewhere. Now, a game's length is not an indicator of its quality; games as disparate as Pacman and Dys4ia accomplish a great deal with a brief playtime. The issue with Gardenarium is that it does not do enough meaningful things with the duration that the player spends with it.\n\nGardenarium has you climb Seussian hillside, collecting trash that causes the landscape to populate with vegetation. Along the way you meet a few nonsequitor characters who tell abridged tales of their life. The game has an abrupt ending where the gameplay perspective changes and asks the player to wander around.\n\nDespite my dry description, there's some actual intrigue here. The aesthetic to Gardenarium is utterly psychedelic, as alien plants pulse and throb with gorgeously animated high-resolution sprites. The flora also grows in amazing patterns that track your movement, similar to the flowers that grow around Ameratsu in Okami. The few charcters you meet also have quite a bit of personality, and some of their lines allude to tragic and humorous anecdotes. The switch of perspective is also an amazing concept for a game mechanic, not unlike what was accomplished by Super Paper Mario, but the promise of toggling between two and three dimensional planes was not used for any kind of clever transdimensional level design. A pity, really.\n\nIt's entirely possible that there's some sort of obtuse hidden content that extends the experience past the apparent ending, but I wasn't able to unearth it. On the contrary, there's a lot suggest that this game was intended as more of a playable pitch for a more complete game, or maybe even a portfolio piece. The animation included is obviously very time-intensive to produce, yet the world has little to explore or do in it. The endgame is an interesting concept, but doesn't seem to expand the the game in any meaningful or mechanically satisfying way. Even the vauge theme of corporate disillusionment murmered by the cast doesn't seem very well fleshed out. The game very much feels like it's less than the sum of its parts, as the each individual component seems too compromised.\n\nI ultimately enjoyed the time I spent with this game just because I'm an animation nut, and I'll let the developer keep my money out of appreciation for their craft. That said, I would not recommend the game unless you can't get enough of its visual style. To the developers, I hope you continue animating and eagerly await your future output!","March 1","false","0.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/423750/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Gardenarium is a pastel love song to perhaps the internet’s most beloved art form: the animated gif.\n\nThough it’s true Gardenarium is a game, one played from the first person perspective and consequently fully explorable in real time, it is in many ways something closer resembling an organic museum, shifting and looping pieces hanging in the sky and growing from the ground around you as you journey toward the peak of Cloud 9. Walking is a necessary burden in Gardenarium, but it is the moments of stillness and quiet appreciation that make it so wondrously enthralling. Why you have found yourself in this floating garden and what you are meant to do there becomes secondary to the act of absorbing the environment around you. Geometric flowers sway and shift colors, abstract patterns hang in the sky, and the adorably unsettling populace recite epigrams and rhymes as if life could be so simple. But perhaps here, in this surreal and hypnotic greenhouse atop a cloud, it can.\n\nThere is an immediate urge among many I know to label products of the internet age as ephemeral and thematically shallow. But while many of the art forms particular to the modern era are surfacely uncomplicated, their emotional earnestness in many ways seems not a rejection of intelligent thought, but a dismissal of the notion that art must be in some way inaccessible to be deep. In this way Gardenarium’s penchant for blunt, matter of fact wit and uninhibited social commentary feels refreshingly honest. These thoughts may stem from the odd and inscrutable inhabitants of Gardenarium’s organic pastel world, but they carry enough weight in them to pull you out of the clouds and back to earth. Gardenarium is not an exercise in linguistic fortitude, but of accessibility and honesty, spoken in a style too quickly cast aside as the degeneration of literature by the next generation.\n\nGardenarium arrives at a time when the concept of what constitutes a game/art/literature is being redefined by the day. At this point it seems pedantic to continually qualify what have always been loose labels bestowed largely for the sake of exclusion. Whether or not Gardenarium’s 30-minute walk through a sky garden is a game is irrelevant to the experience itself, one that is both beautiful and poignant, and more emotionally honest than most games could ever hope for. Like its recursive floral installations, Gardenarium is a game I want to get lost in, watching the flowers bloom and dance as I daze into the hazy distance and enjoy the peace of constancy.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","May 31","true","0.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

You walk around or "explore" for about 20 minutes, talk to some odd characters along the way and that concludes your experience for 5 bucks. Some people claim you better be high to play this one, even a stoner would hate this game. I'd rather lookup trippy desktop wallpapers than play this game. It's definitely more fun!\n\nThe graphics are pretty cool; big puffy clouds and random objects right out of an acid trip. This isn't enough to make the game though, it's very short and the controls make it very difficult to enjoy the exploration. Furthermore, you'll never really know where to go or when you are actually done with this game. It comes down to how long you can waste your time on something like this. I wasted 36 minutes; don't repeat my mistake.\n\nWorth $5? Hahaha. Don't make me laugh.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

You can talk to anyone of 4 characters, while struggling to platform and pick up soda cans.  This game's only real selling point is it's vibrant and "trippy" graphics, but the minimalism style the developer used just falls short.  There is one notable part where you walk through a cave and you're basically just staring at violenty bright solid colored wall for a few minutes.

I think people gravely underestimate how time-consuming animating actually is, especially on the scale this game did it. Some of those simple shapes have 20-30 cells in them and it is actually impressive how smoothly they transition.\n\nMy only real complaint with the game is that the section at the end feels like something that was tossed in at the last second and wasn't really very fun, especially since it didn't reward me with fun trippy animations like the rest of the game. It feels like they just threw in something game-y because they didn't feel too confident in the game's normal mode of gameplay and that's actually kind of sad since I liked the game and would probably replay it. It's one of those things that I can see myself loading up if I've had a bad day and need to stare at some eye candy but I can't see myself caring enough about the ship section to play past the sage, I'd probably just restart the game there from now on.\n\nIt would be nice if the game got more content or if it were made into something that felt more complete and well-rounded. What they have here is an excellent proof-of-concept that I think deserves more exploration and I would certainly play something designed on the premise of this game, especially if it has comperable eye candy.","May 8","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
