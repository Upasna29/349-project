This is a simplistic match 3 time waster, with a nice twist. The level challenges are a good way to keep things interesting and add more difficulty, and gravity shifting mechanic means your lovely stratigy to get that nice big combo can be screwed up, or even made avaliable by those fun little blocks.\n\nNice varity in game types, and unlike any match three you'll find on facebook, you're never halted from that "one more turn" you want.\n\nI reccomend this to anyone who'se looking for something simple yet challenging.","December 15, 2015","true","0.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","1"

I wasn't able to switch the selected item. You have to imitate tap and slide with mouse. Then ingame i wasn't able to just quit to main menu by hitting escape! WTF, why the hell i'm supposed to just randomly hit all the buttons to figure that out? Also whole lot of buttons do nothing when you try to click them and you're forced press "enter" or "whitespace". The damn interface is just a mess. I will not mention that it replaced all buttons with controller notations that i wasn't using.\n\nBackgrounds are damn awful, come on, they are so low res it hurts.\n\nAlso game doesn't bother explaning it's base gameplay mechanics. Why the hell i had to wait 10 minutes for the first bomb to complete level objectives? You need some kind of tutorial that explains that you can accelerate time and get multipliers by changing gravity without destroying any blocks.\n\nThe game itself is not that bad, puzzles are pretty satisfying, but all of the above leaves me no options but to negative vote it.","January 24","false","40.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you like that kind of game I would still recommend not playing this game.\n\n1. The controls are not easy.  You don't know what buttons to push initially without randomally hitting buttons (this is for keyboard and mouse)\n\n2. There are no tutorials to speak of, so you are muddling through the game half blind.\n\n3.  If you want to change the keyboard controls, the naming scheme is hard to understand with the tags in the game (what is the "A" button)\n\nBecause of these issues, I cannot recommend this game.  If those were fixed then I will review the game again and make my decision at that time.","February 6","false","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Weak controls, bad art and UI. This game could and should be good. It just needs a complete presentation overhaul.","February 10","false","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It explains in detail how the controls are setup and what each diffent mode is and how they play. For a match 3 puzle game it is one of the best I have played and for $3.99 I cant argue with the price. Zen mode is truly like crack.\n\nManual Below\nhttp://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/403300/manuals/GravBlocks_Manual.pdf?t=1450275074\n\nPros\n- Lots of gameplay modes\n- Many control options\n- Plenty of achievments\n\nCons\n- Graphics could be better\n- Mouse controls on menus can be a bit finicky","February 25","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Should've called Zen Mode "Crack Mode" instead.  Can be crazy challenging.","February 6","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
