I have clocked nearly a full 2 hours into this game and still have not completed it.\nI will list my pros and cons and then elaborate on them afterward.\nPros+Good humor - If you watch the slide show for Lucid Awakening 1 you would think the two characters are nearly related the way they talk to eachother. Not only there, but throughout the whole game you will see that type of family/close friend humor.\n+Great dialogue - Oh my god, the dialogue between characters is absolutely amazing, rarely in games nowadays do we see diverse and interesting dialogue(This helps greatly with the story)\n+Interesting story - The story is super interesting and around every turn it changes and there is a new, exciting event happening.\n+Great characters - I love the way the characters react with oneanother, each having their own personalities and reacting in different ways.\n+Cool action sequences - I'll admit, when I first saw the action sequences I thought "Oh, another quick time event" but, it actually can help or hurt you. If you don't get it on time then you could fail to sneak past a gaurd. Though out of the 2 hours I have only used it once or twice, in the same level.\n+Great music - Another great component to the story, the more moodworthy the music the more you can immerse yourself into what is happening, whether it be dramatic, scary, or exciting!\n+Cool enviroments - I have played many RPGs and seen many different enviroments along the way, but this game's enviroment diversity is definitely a refreshing experience compared to other rpgs.\nCons-Non-interactive world - Why can't I look at bookshelves and find a book and read it, or find a hidden item, or look into a chest and steal items from people? This would make the game SO much better. Sure, there are some hidden little twinkling golden things that have gold or health equipment, but that's it. If you could expand upon that, this game would be much much better.\n\nOverall RatingI absolutley love this game's story, dialogue, characters, and enviroment. This game can keep me busy for hours on end, and has a TON of replayability, it fell short with the non interactive world, but that barely hurts the game's score.\nI am going to score this one at a 9/10 and definitely recommend it to anyone who loves RPG's.\n9/10","January 21, 2015","true","1.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The battle system while still turn based feel strategic and you can avoid battles if you really want to, the game is llinear until a certain point in the story. I had a few thingsthat bothered me and I`m sure a few others will have too: The heath bar of ennemies sometimes seem misplaced in battles making the ennemies hard to see at times. I just wished that the parts where npcs joined you were longer, i also had issues with one particular dungeon in the games. Theses negatives points doesn`t make the game not enjoyable in my humble opinion it`s a matter of preferences. The developer is also really open to his fans/players and use their feedback to improve the game which is a big + for me. Do not hesitate if you like RPGS games, you will enjoy this garentee!!","January 24, 2015","true","30.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The game itself is reminicent of old RPG action adveture games with a strong feeling of final fantasy about it but it is easier to understand and follow the story. the entire thing is something I would expect to have come a large game development company not a indie developer working on his own. definitly worth the Â£4 I paid.","March 14, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I mean the game begins, a lot of story goes on, you discover many things in the game mechanics, transformations, skills... Its just the prologue?!\n\nYep, you discovered a lot, fought a lot, mastered the mechanics. And you're still in the prologue. This of course means the game lasts, and as far as i went i didnt have a single boring moment.\n\nI Even liked watching Cyrill and Terra talk about the first game.\n\nOverall, my RPG Soul and this games awesomeness will loot it a 9/10 rating so far.","January 17, 2015","true","2.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","1"
