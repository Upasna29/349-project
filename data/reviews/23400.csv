"http://steamcommunity.com/id/praxis666/recommended/23400/","praxis666","Praxis-[CE]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/praxis666/","1529 products in account","Imperium Romanum is a city-builder set in the ancient Roman Empire. If you're thinking, "Hey that sounds just like the old Caesar series" then you're not far off. Much like the old Sierra series, Imperium Romanum places you in a series of towns and settlements and asks you to build housing, establish farming and resource production, and set up industries. You'll also build defenses and armies to protect yourself from barbarian hordes and conquer nearby villages.\n\nI think Imperium Romanum takes a slightly more casual and less complex approach to the genre. First, at least in the missions I played, each level seemed to be completely contained and it didn't seem as though your city carried over throughout multiple stages of the campaign. Rather, each mission starts in a different settlement and gives you goals to accomplish there and then you move on to the next. There is a sandbox gameplay option so if you want to build a super-city, you can do that, but the campaign missions don't seem to be cumulative.\n\nCombat is rather simplistic and basically your troops are limited to a couple of formations, neither of which can actually be changed on the fly once battle has begun.\n\nOne thing I did notice here is that unlike a lot of the "historical" city management titles, the game doesn't skirt around the issue that slavery was a common practice. Slaves will do all the building and hauling here, and they get separate "housing" and will not be able to fill the "free" jobs that your settlers will take. If you overwork your slaves (i.e. don't build enough slave shelters) then they are likely to revolt until you get their workload under control.\n\nThe graphics are pretty detailed and there is a nice variety of industries and buildings you can introduce in your town.\n\nOverall, it's a nice little city builder for the history buffs, and it offers a more forgiving approach to planning than some of the other similar games I've played. (read this as: I never had to break out a spreadsheet to lay out perfect housing and industrial blocks in Imperium Romanum in order to beat a level. Then again, I might have been an overly compulsive Caesar player. ymmv)\n\n","August 20, 2014","true","4.5"," 106 of 108 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","106","108","6","0"

Old games like Zeus and Pharoah still surpass this game by miles. I'd say skip this one and get Caesar instead.\n\n\nYou can't build too far from your Forum and will require Marketplaces to expand to other portions of the map. The problem is that each building will require a house nearby to employ it.\n\nYou won't be able to design a city that has different zones (residential, industrial, agriculture and so on) everything becomes mashed up.\n\nThis in turn creates a snowball effect. For example: You want to build a mining camp for a marble deposit that is on the outskirts of your city. So you create a marketplace, the mine, then houses.\n\nHere's the fun part: The houses will require supporting structures e.g. bakery, altar, butcher. Now each building will require a certain material upkeep which leeches into your economy as well.\n\nSo your little expansion becomes a city of it's own. I tried ignoring their need for clothes and sausages but then that little town became rebellious. So for one little mine on the outskirts, I had to create a new town and the supporting structures to it.\n\nThe people in the houses seem to randomly choose their jobs. So you might have some unemployment in one sector and a lack of employees in the other. This game just becomes very grating after a while.\n\nWhy do they want so many sausages anyways? Every game it's always about sausages.\n\nLook, I enjoyed the game but I dreaded having to start a new sandbox or campaigns. This is coming from someone who enjoys punishing City games like Banished.","June 13, 2014","false","9.3"," 89 of 126 people (71%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","71","89","126","15","9"

Probably the best city-building game I've played. I like it better than CivCity: Rome. This is a lot like Sim City Societies, but with some actual goals. Societies suffered from the problem of "well, now my city has enough X to make more Y. And now I have enough Y to build Z. Great. So?" There was no reason to do anything.\n\nImperium Romanum is a city builder with very definite goals. "Grow your town to X population. But in this scenario you can only farm wheat." So to keep you upper crust happy, you'll need to export a lot of grain and import things like meat and cloth. There's also a military aspect, but it's somewhat downplayed. This isn't an RTS; it's a city builder. You definitely need a militia, but you don't need to be a tactical genius to make them effective.\n\nYou need to keep your economy going by producing... something, keep production running by growing your population, keep your population happy by importing luxuries.","June 13, 2011","true","4.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/23400/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","It's hard to look at a Roman city-building game and not think of the venerable Caesar series, but I encourage you to put it out of your mind. There are no wandering agents and maze-like roadways to be found here, but there is some solid construction and management. Having more in common with titles like Children of the Nile or Tropico, Imperium Romanum takes a simple system and spreads it across a bewildering array of scenarios and challenges.\n\nEach scenario sets you as the praetor of a city somewhere in the empire, anywhere from Alexandria to Pompeii to Rome itself. Most of the time you'll be starting from just a forum and stockpile, but some scenarios give you a whole city right from the get-go. From there you have to build houses, mines, farms, woodcutters, and other basics to get the town running. Once your settlement is established you can start looking into trade routes, fortifications, temples, schools, and other advanced constructions. There's a fair number of buildings to build, and you'll be building most of them in each scenario.\n\nWhat keeps things fresh as you bounce from province to province are the scenario conditions. Many will limit you in some way, like not having any wood or stone on the map. Instead you'll get supplied by Rome while you get established, and then have to fulfill some goal or start trading to make up the difference. These goals and events are conveyed through the tablet system, which you can trigger whenever you want. You can accept up to three tablets at once, and they can give new objectives, bonuses, or serious curveballs. It's an interesting system to direct the scenarios but some of the tablets can be unexpectedly brutal. One map tasks you with establishing a port, and one of the tablets about halfway through is a tidal wave that wipes out anything you've built up to that point.\n\nI know that sounds absolutely terrible, but Imperium Romanum is so relaxed and simple that it's hard to get mad at it. Buildings are usually constructed swiftly and your resource production is very generous in its quantities. There is warfare as well, but it's as simple as building barracks and sending your regiments out to conquer barbarians. About the only real frustration I've found is that our citizens have needs that must be fulfilled to keep them happy and out of trouble, and after six hours and as many scenarios I still can't keep them from turning irate and rebellious. Even if you build them everything you can think of, some of them always seem to get mad about something.\n\nPart of the problem is a lack of information available. You have almost no charts or graphs for your citizens or your resources, and clicking on buildings only gives general information about their contents. This means there's a rough learning curve while you figure out how many wheat farms and bakeries it takes to supply your citizens with bread, but like I mentioned, the game is too relaxed to ever really punish you for it. There's no fail state that I can see, and citizens never move out, instead opting to complain endlessly and maybe riot.\n\nThe presentation does a lot to endear Imperium Romanum in spite of its shortcomings as well. The clean, detailed graphics make for picturesque settlements and countryside in every scenario. You can follow your citizens around and watch them gesticulate wildly as they chat or pray. Construction is a bit unpolished, going from a pile of materials to a whole building in the blink of an eye, but the buildings themselves are magnificent. The sound design is fine with its understated bustle and alerts, and it includes some oddly jazzy tunes as well.\n\nWhile not one of the best city builders I've played, Imperium Romanum still manages to be one of the most enjoyable. The charming look and feel of the game, coupled with the simple building and tablet guidance, make this a great title to relax with. You're bound to run into some small faults and frustrations, but odds are it will win you back across its wealth of scenarios. It might be a bit barebones, but there's a good heart in there that makes it worth a look.","June 3","true","5.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The "Grand ages of Rome" is the sequel of it and has somewhat better graphics, comes with a plague of fires all the time. In Imperium Romanum that doesn’t happen. You have a lot of time to put up the fires and enjoy your city view & achievements. In this game you can relax but not so in Grand Ages of Rome. Tips: Plant trees near the wood cutter's cabins, this way you’ll have a continuous flowing supply of wood. Extend your aqueducts to the maximum they can reach and build wells where fires occur more often. If you have enough money anything can be built in a flash. Don’t harass the barbarian tribes until you are really ready to face them. Build wooden walls around your town center to avoid attacks.

Estenda os aquedutos ao máximo que podem alcançar e construa poços onde os fogos ocorrem com mais frequência. Se você tiver dinheiro suficiente tudo pode ser construído rápido.

I really enjoy the resource management and fullfilling the needs of the citizens but it does have several problems that might bother you:\n\n1. Maybe I'm just a n00b but often time my cities end up looking like blobs of buildings with no real cohesion. There are roads you can place but they seem rather pointless as traffic isn't even a possible issue in the game.\n\n2.It is extremely difficult to get a good approval rating the game. This is because as your city grows and develops more the citizens need more things to keep them happy but at some point you start to run out of space do to the blob thing happening and so since all your buildings have a radius of effect your citizens remain unhappy\n\n3. The level design for the campaign can be rather janky at times. At one point I needed iron so I could build a proper army but the only iron resource was right next to a barbarian camp which I could not kill because I did not have a big enough army. I eventually solved this by creating multiple barracks since barracks have a minimum number of soldiers but I feel the whole situation was stupid and annoying\n\n4.Army can't cross bridges and there doesn't appear to be any logical reason why. It looks like a bug because all the soldiers just seem to stack up at the top of the bridge and stand there.\n\nOver all its a fun game but it is far from perfect.","September 4, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Little to no depth.\n\nThe most annoying thing for me was the evolvement of houses. In Caesar you had full control over where evolvement takes place, since you were the one chosing which goods and services are provided to the neighbourhood. For example, I had whole quarters dedicated to making wine, pottery, oil and so on. Those quarters were provided with everything they needed to evolve to some moderate levels and they were happy with it. It would be ridiculous to provide them with all the luxury goods and services needed to evolve to high class patricians with mansions.\n\nAnd that is where this game is different: You have basically zero control over evolvement of the houses. They just WILL evolve. That would not be a problem, if they were not demanding new stuff and if you don't provide them with that riots will start and they will burn the city down. That is a major flaw for me, since it forces you to basically build a new subcity around EVERY area you want to expand to and there is no way around it.\n\nThere is no way to stop this, let alone build dedicated quarters for certain industries. If you expand it is just building the whole city again next to the city with some minor exceptions and it gets old very, very soon.\n\nIf you have no experience with these games this might be for you. I rather play Caesar again.","August 17, 2015","false","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay and graphics are good.  Quite similar to the old Caesar game, which I played A LOT, but still different enough to not feel redundant.  It's better in that it's a bit more realistic as to what we "know" of ancient roman society.  Allthough not politically correct, the inclusion of slaves really does help as slavery was BIG trade in ancient Rome and Rome wouldn't have been what it was without them.  And yes water water everywhere!!  Rome's big thing was the aquaduct/public water system, people cannot live without it so, build LOTS of wells.  Each business needs houses and water nearby, and those houses need their provisions nearby, so you will have several outposts in one city.  Haven't done any battling other than the tutorial, but will update my review once I do more of that.  In short: RECOMMENDED","March 26","true","38.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
