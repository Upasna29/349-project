"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/395170/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1599 products in account","Distraint is a short psychological horror title in which you play the role of Price, a young man whose job is to seize the property of others. He quickly discovers that he's entering a decent paying career at the cost of his own humanity.\n\nThe game is full of hidden meanings (even Price's name), and the story is something that almost everyone who has had a job can relate to. Myself personally being a slave to call center careers for the past decade, I certainly know how the protagonist feels and the story really hits home for me.\n\nThe graphics and gameplay style will easily remind players of titles such as Lone Survivor, Claire and Home. However, Distraint has a personality and concept that is unique to itself. The atmosphere in the game is heavy, brought on by dimly lit corridors and a pressurized ambiance that gives an overflowing sense of dread for the entirety of the game.\n\nDistraint is an outstanding indie horror title that does its job of instilling fear and dread into the player. The puzzles are very easy and the game is very short, your initial playthrough may take anywhere from 1-2 hours to complete. Subsequent playthroughs will see 30-45 minute timeframes. There are a few grammatical errors within the dialogue at times, but the game is bug and crash free.\n\nThough you may find yourself hard up to pay the asking price for such a short game, the price is worth every penny as every second is enjoyable here. It's also impressive that one person created this title in a little less than 3 months; the same creator behind Silence of the Sleep. If you're looking for a good horror title to spend some time with this Halloween, look no further.\n\nRating:  4.5/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","October 25, 2015","true","3.7"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","24","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/395170/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Distraint is psychological horror adventure game with very powerful moments of sadness and terror. I can say with confidence that this is one of the best games I've played in a long time.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You play as a property-seizer called Price who is (to some degree) forced to seize people's houses in order to get a job. The game makes you to go to three different people, to which you have to explain that they're gonna have to leave the property. You have to help some of them in order to gain their cooperation. But even if they're willing to cooperate, Price's consciousness tells him that something is wrong with what he's doing. His mind soon becomes divided between getting the job and doing the right thing. That's when the crazy stuff begin to happen. Blood from everywhere, illusions, you name it. It's a perfect psychological horror.\n\nPros:    Amazing Atmosphere | This is the main component of every horror game. I have to say that this game is simply one of the best at creating such atmosphere. There are barely any jumpscares, but the whole feeling is made by music, art style, the story and the feelings that are caused by the story. The atmosphere is actually so good that I got goosebumps even while playing in the daylight!\nArt style | This game's pixel art looks just amazing. If screenshot look at least slightly appealing to you, wait till you see it in action (you can just watch the video above!). The colour mix is really well-picked. I especially liked the purple-themed boss scene.\nThe Story | So, Distraint really has a story that touches one's heart. You have to take an old lady's home, visit her graveyard and face your inner dæmons. The story is always kind of unsettling and sad, but it also serves some (surprisingly) well-placed jokes that make you laugh while not losing the tense atmosphere.\nThe Music | As you might expect, the musical part of the game is really good as well. There are not many more things to say about it, though, except that it should have its own DLC.\nPuzzles | There are a few (not many) puzzles in this game. They are a neat addition and they are quite enjoyable.\nAchievements | There are 16 achievements in this game. They are mostly related to the story, but to unlock some of them, you will have to use certain items on certain objects or people. Or just do certain things. You will unlock most of the achievements on your first playthrough (2 - 3 hours), maybe even all of them, but to get the rest of them, you will have to play the game again. This is far from problematic, though, I completed the game several times and enjoyed the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. There is also a helpful guide on Steam Hub for this game, in case you'll get stuck somewhere.\nSteam Integration | Apart from already mentioned Achievements, you will also get three Trading Cards for playing Distraint. Oh, yeah, and the backgrounds for crafting the badge look quite cool.\nCons:    SteamOS and MacOS Support | There isn't any. I don't know why, to be honest. It's a shame. Modern games should all support those two operating systems besides Windows.\nCloud Support | This game also doesn't have Steam Cloud support, but I don't find it too problematic since nothing except options is actually worth saving. The story is not too long, so even if you lose it, it's not a big problem. And it's worth replaying anyway.\nPricing | This is the first time I'm doing this so it might be a bit weird: I think $4,99 is not a high enough price for this game. The artistic value is amazing and it deserves more money.\nThe final verdict:This game is so good. I played the whole story multiple times and I enjoyed it every time. It has great thrilling moments, sad emotional moments, moments of wonder, jokes ... you name it. I confess, psychological thrillers are my kind of games an this one was no exception. While playing Distraint, I felt very similar emotions to when I played The Park (another great game, but overpriced), except with a tiny bit less horror involved. For some reason, the way they picked just the right colours really stands out, as you can see on Steam Store screenshots. All of the involved sounds are also really good, you can even choose between different sounds of text-switching. The default controls are a bit clunky, but you can set them to whatever you like, so that is not even remotely a problem.\nIf you like horror games, but not the ones with cheap jumpscares for little kids, this is probably a game for you. There are some similar games out there that should give you a pretty good idea what to expect. The games is definitely cheap for what it offers, so consider getting it. But if you see it on discount, click on that shiny green "Add to cart" button without hesitation.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.","January 17","true","7.3"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","23","30","0","3"

This game is a surreal spiraling descent into the maddening mind of Price, as his sins soon overpower him. Past sins interrupt and cloud the present, and the bizarre and grotesque becomes intermingled into Price's daily life. Very well done game and a great follow up to Silence of the Sleep.\n\nWhat we liked:\n- Surreal imagery.\n- Disturbing sequences jolt you out of normal puzzle solving moments\n- Atmospheric, spine tingling sounds, entice you and set the mood perfectly\n\nWhat may through you off about this game is the retro graphics, simple design, and its middling degree of difficulty. I found that DISTRAINT's style was quaint and charming. More diversity, and length would always go a long way with gamers as well. Still, this is a wonderful little thriller, hard to put down once you sit down to play it!","October 21, 2015","true","4.1"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","0"

But the game's story and narrative are really good and can easily keep you engaged as you go through different distraints and see how Price reacts to what he has to do. The visions that sometimes break up reality not only serve as a great way to express Price's feelings but are also appropriately creepy, gruesome and serve as an important part of the plot.\n\nWhen you consider that Distraint was an one-man project completed in just a few months I can only congratulate the dev on the result: Distraint is an effective and engaging psychological horror and an easy recommendation.","December 3, 2015","true","2.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","2"

From its unnerving horror, which keeps you at the edge of your seat to its rich characters, 'DISTRAINT' is an unforgettable look into the best and worst of people, and what we do to ourselves and one another.\n\nWhere so much of indie horror fails with boring design, broken gameplay, bad storytelling or a combination of those, 'DISTRAINT' is a breath of fresh air for the genre.

After reading all of the good reviews for this game I decided to buy it, it was a huge sale anyway, so, why not. Andd... I can't say I regret I've bought and played it, but it leaves a huge depressing trace after finishing it, even though it doesn't lack some good humour.\n\nThe game itself is amazing, atmosphere, style, jokes, ironic commentaries, puzzles (spent a good hour on mushrooms level lol). I don't like horror games, but here wasn't much of it, so it was just a little bit creepy, especially playing at night with lights off.\n\nAnyway, my point is.. This game must be played if you're 18-20 and older, otherwise you wouldn't understand what the game is trying to tell you.  The ending was pretty predictable, but nevertheless powerful. The moment with the lantern near Mrs. Goodwin's grave made me drop a tear.\n\n9/10 for short, but amazing experience.","May 24","true","5.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I spent a fair amount of time trying to power through Silence of the Sleep's chapter 2 but evetually gave up.  There was enough promise there that I wanted to see what Jesse Makkonen could do with better design decisions, though.  Distraint isn't quite there yet, but it's a step in the right direction.  Silence of the Sleep's art style would have made this better I think than the goofy looking bobble heads, the message of the game is pretty juvenile (the basic moral seems to be that deadbeats shouldn't have to pay their bills and only bad people would expect them to), and it's pretty short, but the atmosphere and gameplay are well done.","November 22, 2015","true","12.1"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","16","25","0","0"

Yes, he is that guy. To his credit, he seems to have a conscience, and that is where the psychological horror comes from here. We see him struggle with his own demons and his own decisions, as he races towards a promotion.\n\nDistraint will take you to a world that is obscure and ruthless, yet its inhabitants are charming characters with oversized heads while tackling various themes such as greed, compassion and depression in a compelling and unique fashion. It takes some unexpected turns, but doesn’t rely on disgusting imagery to weird you out, as this game has more fun playing with your mind. I wouldn’t say that this is a frightening game, but a few jump scares are executed pretty well. This is a particularly good thing in story-driven games, especially when its aim is to convey a message to the player. No need to worry about dying either; the worst that could happen to you is lingering on a puzzle.\n\nSpeaking of puzzles, they are relatively simple, yet clever. Some involves a considerable amount of walking back and forth, and some segments also introduce innovative ways to progress further into Price’s living nightmare ( I won't spoil it here). And the gameplay is... well, you can walk from left to right and vice-versa, the controls are pretty standard: W,A,S,D to move, E for the action button, F to use your lantern and spacebar to open inventory.\n\nTo sum it up, Distraint is short but sweet. It's a game with an intriguing storyline and a decent sense of humour among the horror.  It’s a carefully developed and intriguing video game, made by one man that is worth your time.\n","November 1, 2015","true","3.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lab23/recommended/395170/","lab23","lab23","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lab23/","320 products in account","There are a few restraining facts that should be known about Distraint before making a decision to invest time or money into the experience. First and foremost it’s a small game in every respect. It’s made by a one man team in a very short time and that show in everything from the length of the story and the assets used to the somewhat unpolished UI.\n\nMr. Makkonen is also Finnish and while obviously being quite fluid in his English there are some weird sentences and grammar not spotted in the proof reading. Sometimes it also feels like nuances in the dialogue has been lost in the translation.\n\nWith those reservations aside however I very much enjoyed the few hours it took to complete. The narrative feels fresh and the characters, while not overly complex, feels human enough to care for.\nThe story itself is about a man whose life choices doesn’t add up to his own moral compass, and the internal consequences of a life lived not true to oneself. The graphical horror could be said to represent his deteriorating self image, and the ending while quite obvious felt like a natural conclusion to the story.\n\nHighly recommended for fans of Makkonens unique style and fans of psychological horror looking for something very different.","January 18","true","4.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's really very short, only an hour or two, depending how many circles you walk in while trying to solve the puzzles. Most of the puzzles are simple, but you can get lost or skip something over pretty easily. It's got a decent story, almost something like the films "Naked Lunch" or "Eraserhead". A surreal experience, but not all that scary. The music and art add to the atmosphere well, but sometimes the two dimensional levels can be disorienting.\n\nI'd recommend it if you are looking for an eerie suspenseful game to play late at night.

The trailer alone spoils the atmosphere that is constant within DISTRAINT. But don't let that turn you off! Through it's quirks, its got a charm that's not really seen in many horror games these days. And the price is not too shabby either!\n\nHOWS THE GRAPHICS?\nThe graphics are pretty straightforward. 2D & Filtered. I will note that the art style they went for was kind of a turn off for me, it kind of took away from the horror aspect of it and just made it seem goofier than what it was trying to portray.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE STORY?\nYou play a liquidator for a loan firm on a one way trip to insanity, as he tries to cope with revoking his humanity for a livible wage. This go from bad to worse as the game progresses until things end in the darkest ways.\n\nGAMEPLAY?\nThe gameplay is a rather well blend of Horror, Point & Click, and Puzzle! Even if it did some times dragged out in places.\n\nSO WHATS THE COON'S VERDICT?\n\nPros:\nQuirky game with a depressing but surreal plot\nGood puzzles and gameplay that does envelop you in the story\nPrice is $4.99, if you got some pocket change to spare in that wallet\nCons:\nShort\nLacking visual depth in its art style\nDrags on in places\nFinal Score\n7.5 OUT OF 10","April 12","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

His mind slowly slipping into depression as reality distorts.\n\nRoughly 2 hours, amazing art and sound track with dark humor and horror its a very nice experience which I would have loved to be longer, its only 5 bucks and feels worth every penny to support this man and his creations.

The story was ok at best but the thing that gets me is the moral. I've seen more subtle morals from Saturday morning cartoons. The idea that greed is bad is so black and white it's painful to hear again. Also the idea that if your job hurts someone who should quit even thou it's the only thing keeping you off the streets is a dumb moral to teach. Also most of the weird stuff the guys sees is explained as his "conscious" when it fact it feels more like something someone with a metal disorder would see not someone suffering from guilt. While some of the visual were creepy, most were meh.\n\nI really had high hopes for this game but sadly it couldn't even meet a faction of them.

Give him quite good art and sound design skills. Don't explain to them how and why puzzles are done in story-driven games. You get Distraint. A game that desperatly tries to tell a psychological horror about guilt and EVIL CORPORATE SYSTEM that is so EVIL and INHUMANE using the most hamfisted SYMBOLISM and incredibly boring gameplay.\n\nThis is a purely story with "puzzles" horror game (which has manual saves seemingly just because either developer couldn't figure out how to make autosaves work or just because the engine they chose is pretty bad at autosaving), where you just walk back and forth small locations in 2D perspective trying to find the next trigger for the next thing to happen to procede to a next location and repeat the process ad nauseam. There little rhyme or reason to a lot of things that happen with game never really understanding that you can't mix totally unreal situatons with real situations without any thought and hope that it creates a surreal feeling instead of the mess you just don't care about.\n\n"Puzzles" are usually "guess what silly item combination you need to do" kind with several pointless minigames, including one that isn't a puzzle but a guessing game. There are countless moments when you just don't know what game wants from you, either because you need to revisit some place for no reason and some new interaction is now available, or because you need to use an item in some illogical way (often the former). Game constantly tries to bombard you with YEAH EDGY moments for no reason, with blood, guts, drugs popping up and making you sigh and roll your eyes instead of feeling any kind of tension or surprise. It's just there. Evil people are EEEEEVIIIIL. Any attempts at some symbolism are silly at best.\n\nIt's a really really silly game that could've been fine if it was even shorter or went for a dark comedy twist. Instead, it's too long (for being around 2-3 hours game), too messy and stupid and isn't worth your time. There are better examples of 2D horror adventure/survival horror like The Last Door, Home, Lone Survivor or, hell, even also TOO EDGY and silly The Cat Lady is more worth your time than this.","April 21","false","3.5"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","3","13","0","0"

A super short (around 2 hours) psychological Horror game, or rather an interactive story in this case. Besides some Puzzles (which are basically just use this on that to get this to use on another thing). This goes on throughout the whole game. While the atmosphere is pretty neat, it always feels like there is nothing much to it, or downright there just for the shock factor. That main theme of the main characters Price is Guilt gets made pretty clear after even 5-10 minutes of the game.\n\nI'm sorry, but as a huge fan of the Silent Hill series this game left me really underwhelmed, already not expecting much to begin with. Many sudden scary moments are very predictable or resort down to Blood, at times this felt exactly like reading your average videogame creepypasta.\n\nConsidering the lack of gameplay, the short lenght, the very easy puzzles, the predictable story and the rather lazy attempt at horror, i can't really recommend this game, even for it's cheap price, especially because there are way better alternatives out there for the same price.","October 31, 2015","false","2.8"," 5 of 25 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","5","25","0","4"

Distraint is one of those games that's worth playing once, maybe twice for achievement hunting (much like The Park). The art style is interesting, and brings with it a feel that another style wouldn't have. Some puzzles can be frustrating if you don't happen to go just the right way under just the right circumstances or click just the right thing that often feels arbitrary once you finally discover it, but there are Let's Plays on Youtube if you're really stuck and looking for a hint. The story is the real heart of this game.\n\nNot recommended for people who trigger easily, but then you're probably not looking for a horror game if that's the case.","February 4","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The jump scares fell flat on their face for the most part due to poor execution and choice of graphics style. However, the game did fine with setting a creepy and unsettling atmosphere. I can think of one moment that was kind of gross.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple and doesn't require much from the player. You'll mostly be walking around and solving the occasional puzzle. Some of the puzzles can be confusing due to the mental state of the character which means that solutions might not appear logical in the normal way. You'll be doing some weird things. You might also become very stuck at certain parts like I did.\n\nThe strongest part of this game is the story which suffers slightly from subtle English errors in the form of missing words for some expressions and one idiom that is reversed. The story does have some good moments, especially towards the end of the game. One of them was touching and the other made me think, "No way."\n\nOverall, the game seems like an okay experience and made me want to finish it despite having some difficulties with a couple puzzles. The price point is really up to the person, but if you're on a tight budget and are looking for many hours per dollar spent, this game is clearly not going to live up to that expectation.","May 14","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is very unique, and I wonder now whether that uniqueness is part of what left me feeling like I was just grinding it out in the end, because I was never really emotionally invested in the protagonist's "victims"? The horror was underdone, and I say that because Distraint starts off strong, but by about 2/3 of the way through it pretty much ceases to exist. In a lot of ways this makes it feel like you are playing two separate games - One that has the bones of a great shock-horror, and then later it is watered down to a semi-emotional scrolling sim with plenty of drug use. Likewise, the soundtrack starts off pretty well, and then just dulls down with the horror aspect of the gameplay.\nThe reason I can't be super harsh in my evaluation of this game however, is that it was only a three month project start to finish. Yes it shows, and yes it is a little more frustrating than if the game was just completely rubbish the whole way through, but it is still pretty well on par for games around the $2-$3 mark even though they would have had far more time invested in most cases. Distraint is solid enough of a game that it asks the question of other games in its price range, "What did you actually deliver for all that time you spent?" And rightly so, it's the question I'll be asking from now on too!\nGreat concept, solid ending, but it's a shame it was rushed.","June 6","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
