Reminiscent of busta move, but firing down and the projectiles obey the laws of gravity. The firing system is a constantly swinging pendulum so timing is important, but also comes into play in later levels when you have to swing the projectiles under platforms. Fun!","November 19, 2015","true","2.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

And I have no idea what in the hell determines your stage ranking when you're done. If it's time/number of moves like I suspect, then to hell with this game, because it's still got RNG-based drops, and that means HELLO REPLAYS FOR LUCKY CHAINS.\n\nGame's bad is what I'm saying.\n\n* Google it, younguns","November 19, 2015","false","3.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"
