He stays in there for months upon end and teleporting is the LEAST weirdest thing he has to do every few minutes.\n\nLamulana is a game where you MUST, and I mean MUUUUUUUST, write down EVERY glyph you find and EVERY conversation you have with a dead skeleton lying on the ground on a sheet of paper and tape it all onto the walls. Yes, your real, physical walls. Arrange them into a map based on WHERE in the La-Mulana ruins you found each note. Ready some strings and pins because you're going to need to make arbitrary connections with two notes in entirely different locations with possible relations.\n\nOh, the La-Mulana ruins? It's non-euclidean. That means it's full of distorted/repeating space connected by portals all over the place that doesn't make any sense at all. It drives a lesser man insane. BUT NOT YOU. NO.

It then throws you, a small and powerless character, into a huge, dangerous world without any sort of guidance or sense of direction, forcing you to spend dozens of hours reading text, deciphering cryptic riddles, memorizing the map layouts, and learning the world's lore if you wish to progress.\n\nTo call the difficulty "retro" would be a disservice; the gameplay consists of all the worst parts of Castlevania backtracking, Myst puzzles, trial-and-error gameplay, and punishing NES-style platforming. Every room is filled with the most irritating enemies imaginable. The main character's controls are stiff and terrible, resembling Donkey Kong or Speulunker. You lose complete control of your movement when falling or taking damage, so one wrong jump or a hit from an enemy could knock you down several screens and force you to do everything all over again. Sometimes the game will drop you through an invisible trapdoor to the same effect, and expect you to remember where it was, or an enemy will hit you immediately after a screen transition, and you will just have to learn to enter the room from a different way next time. The gameplay can only be described as emotionally draining, and it only ever gets harder and never apologizes for itself.\n\nThe rules and physics are not even consistent, as puzzles will often involve illusionary walls, invisible platforms, unclear objectives, mysterious event flags that trigger under arbitrary conditions and don't tell you what they changed, specific items or weapons you aren't guaranteed to have discovered yet, the understanding and abuse of the minute physics of said items and weapons, rooms which wrap around to other parts of the map in non-Euclidian ways, familiar objects that don't work the way they always have, inconspicuous background decorations that are actually important, and the ever-classic instant-death traps. Your only hope to solve the puzzles, aside from just "try everything", is to look for hints that could literally be anywhere else in the entire game with no rhyme or reason to their placement. The key hint could be on a tablet you might have read hours ago in another area. Sometimes a puzzle will require a dozen hints that are literally strewn all over the entire game. Your time means absolutely nothing to the game; the game assumes you have all the time in the world to study it like a college course, practice until you can defeat erratic and unfair enemies, perform long sections of brutally frustrating platforming, and bang your head against the wall as you wander around for hours because you have no earthy idea where to go next.\n\nAnd yet...\n\nIf you stick with the game through all of the hardships, you will be rewarded with one of the most intricate, creepy, and powerful stories ever to be portrayed in a video game. The story starts out with perhaps hundreds of cryptic hints that will make absolutely no sense, until halfway through the game when some key revelations come to light. Suddenly, everything just clicks into place as the backstory becomes a stunning mosaic. Your mind might be blown as you realize that everything, from the position of every area, to the contents of nearly every room, to the words of every strange character and cryptic tablet, to the placement of every decoration, is there for a reason relevant to the narrative. Even the main character, as he stumbles clumsily through the cluttered and deathly labyrinths of the ruins, becomes relatable as he bears witness to the remnants of something ancient and tragic. There really is nothing else like La-Mulana's story in the way it is conveyed, and it must be experienced firsthand to be believed. It might even leave you hungering for a second playthrough just so you can breeze through the challenges with a sense of foresight and appreciate all the details you might have missed the first time.\n\nJust be warned, it is not a game that expects you to beat it, to enjoy it, or even to play it in the first place. The motivation to push forward must come entirely from the player, as the game certainly has no regard for valuing your time or stringing you along with promises of fun and reward. But it demands to be witnessed, appreciated, and analyzed, much like a thick Shakespearean play or a picture in an art museum. If anything, it is deeply fascinating both as a work of art and as a bold statement about gameplay design, and it is highly satisfying to unravel and conquer its mysteries. But above all, it is definitely not for everybody.","February 16, 2015","true","65.3"," 60 of 63 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","60","63","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/recommended/230700/","ichikumer","ichik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/","1268 products in account","In two words: hard and japanese. Perhaps, that wasn’t eloquent enough. Excruciatingly, unbelievably hard and amusingly delightfully japanese. And if you think it’s “Dark Souls hard”, think again. La-Mulana does to Dark Souls what Dark Souls does to your typical AAA-game. It is an impossible cocktail, where a tiny drop of pleasure is dissolved in a full glass of pain. So you have to work your way to your reward and it will be more of a faint tone than a full-scale experience. But it’s still worth it. Even though you’ll have to deal with those impossible wall-jumps and remorseless bosses, and complete vagueness of the right direction to go. Such outright brutality is so old-school that the game becomes not just an homage to The Maze of Galious like UnEpic did, but a proper successor.\nThis uncompromisingly torturing game-design is a perfect match for an originally freeware game for Windows, made by two enthusiasts inspired by MSX era in gaming. It’s that level of difficulty that accepts a placing of an unkillable (until you find a certain item of course) boss just a few screens to the left from the starting point. But then again what would you expect from a game that tries to recreate an atmosphere of obscure predecessor of modern metroidvanias? If you think now that La-Mulana has a suitably absurd fantasy story, you’re only half right. It still has its background, one of a very grim mythology, but on the surface it’s the story of an archaeologist named Lemeza Kosugi. He’s wearing a fedora, carrying a whip and a revolver and is going inside a prehistoric underground tomb. Of course inside the tomb he will find all sorts of dangers, including venomous snakes, aggressive bats, walking skeletons and all kinds of deadly traps. So, yes, it’s Indiana Jones, but with some additional weirdness. The deeper you venture inside game’s vast dungeon the more horrible truths you will discover about the world’s history and (seemingly) inevitable doom. This doesn’t mean though that there won’t be a whole bunch of comical stereotypic japanese NPCs with their humorous dialogues. They’ll always cheer you up just when you’re about to be soaked in a muddy swamp of depressing events of the past. Of course I mean game’s fictional past, not your pathetic chain of events called life (or mine for that matter).\nAbout how the dungeoneering is made I must say that it looks fairly simple on the surface. You can move in four directions, jump like someone recovering from a car incident and whip those nasty snakes and bats ‘till they die and (hopefully) drop some gold coins. Then there’s the inventory screen with lots of frightening empty space. And a special tab for software management of your notebook. No, not that real one, but an in-game one, which Kosugi uses in his adventures. There’s lots of different software throughout the game that you will pick up in dark corners, but only few may be active at a time, because Mobile Super X has only 1 gigabyte of storage. Player has to choose from such stuff as map display, email client for receiving messages from certain NPC or even decrypt ancient glyphs. To make things even worse, there are 12 program combinations with extra properties like additional invincibility frames after receiving damage. And believe me, you’ll want those frames by the time you’ll get both so-important apps.\nActually you’ll want anything that’ll help even a bit. Oh, those precious bullets for your gun, that almighty destroyer of bosses, they’ll cost a pretty penny, but are so worth it. So, you’ll save and collect, get better weapons, protective items, learn better tricks. And every bit will seem so tiny and insignificant, but in the end you’ll face the hardest challenges and overcome them. And that will be rewarding. La-Mulana isn’t something I would recommend to a stranger. It’s easy to overlook the game’s virtues, especially when learning curve is rather steep. Nonetheless it’s a masterpiece on its own merits. Engaging story, gloomy setting, stupendous world and painstakingly hard puzzles make a combination so monolithic and grandiose, that I just have no other choice but admire it.","December 29, 2014","true","48.3"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","46","51","0","0"

The story is strong and the lore is rich, but none of it is forcibly shoved down your throat. The puzzles are deep and meaningful, and every puzzle in the game has a hint or two hidden away somewhere among the game's many ancient tablets, but nothing is ever spelled out completely. The variety of intimidating bosses are tough and require practice to beat, but there's always a way to make them easier if you're stuck, by exploring and finding items that give you an advantage. The controls are restrictive and will require effort to master, but the platforming never demands anything unreasonable.\n\nThat's the key word when it comes to La-Mulana: effort. Absolutely nothing is given to you for free. Anything you get out of La-Mulana, even how much fun you have playing it, is dependent on how much effort you're willing to put into it. And no game rewards effort quite like La-Mulana. When you finally solve that deeply meaningful puzzle that spans the entire ruins, you feel like a genius, and when your reward is an incredibly powerful weapon, you feel like a god. When you finally obliterate, yes, obliterate the guardian of that treasure, you feel like a boss, and when your reward is nothing less than the second half of the bloody game, you feel like you really are the Chosen One.\n\nLa-Mulana is not just an adventure, it's a full-scale epic. This is one of the longest indie games you'll ever play, yet it remains engaging throughout and retains its replay value without leaning on any rogue-like elements whatsoever. The game's art and soundtrack embrace this, making everything seem larger than you, but also setting a very driving and elevating mood. If you're a master of Metroidvanias and think the game is too easy, there's a kinda sorta but not really hidden Hard Mode, and an actually hidden optional dungeon, recommended for masochists only; that's not a facetious remark. Luckily for most of you, you don't miss out on any of the game's good points by passing it up.\n\nOften, you'll see people describe any indie platformer that's even slightly harder than Mario Bros. as being like "2D Dark Souls." It's stupid, I hate it, and I stop reading reviews when I see it, but if there ever were a game that deserved that title, it would be La-Mulana. But unlike Dark Souls, I would recommend everyone play this game, not just people who want to be able to brag to all of their internet non-friends about how they "beat 2D Dark Souls."","October 27, 2014","true","46.8"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","38","41","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kothorix/recommended/230700/","Kothorix","Kothorix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kothorix/","128 products in account","La Mulana is.... an unfortunate game. It is very interesting and has a lot of potential, but it commits many gaming sins that can't be overlooked. This is a NES era kind of game that is designed to force you to use some kind of guide when playing it (think castlevania 2). If you respond to this, don't just say 'the game is supposed to be hard'. Dark Souls is my favorite game; I know the difference between a game that is difficult because it's designed well, and a game that is difficult because it is designed badly.\n\n-Very little feedback is given for many of the puzzles. Many times if you solve a puzzle, the game simply doesn't show you what exactly you unlocked, or where. Sometimes solving a puzzle in one area will unlock a door or something in an entirely different area.\n\n-Although clues are given, many aren't helpful or refer to something in a later area. Once you get to that area, there is no indication that you needed to use a clue from earlier.\n\n-There are several points in the game where no clues are given for progression. Several times it is necessary to walk through illusionary walls, or break floors/walls to continue, with no indication you need to do so. You are left jumping around constantly attacking everything in the hope you will accidentally solve a 'puzzle'.\n\n-The above point wouldn't be a problem if the game didn't frequently PUNISH you for trial and error. Yes, there are many rooms in the game where, if you attack random walls, lightning strikes your character and does a substantial amount of damage. The game teaches you quickly not to attack random things, but then at other times the only way to continue is to know where to do it. I have died many times, just attacking random walls to see if they would crumble, only to find out that I was indeed supposed to attack a specific part of a wall; but no indication was given to do so.\n\n-Unfair instant death traps and rooms that you simply become 'stuck' in. There are many rooms that just kill you, and other ones that just trap you, forcing you to restart from your last save if you don't have specific items.\n\n-Some puzzles don't reset. Make a mistake and you can never get the item. There are only a few of these, but there isn't any indication that the puzzle will be like this. Once again, the game punishes trial and error. Fortunately, I think they only do this with non-essential items.\n\n-The game doesn't control well enough for some of the fast-paced action segments they throw at you. Boss battles typically aren't hard for any reason other than your character moves slowly and doesn't control in the air well.\n\nIf anyone ever tells you that they beat this game without ever consulting a guide or asking for help, they are lying. I really wanted to like this game; thematically it is amazing, and I love this style of metroidvania action-adventure. I find myself being forced to use a guide all too often, and it really ruins the gaming experience (seriously, some of these 'puzzles' are just impossible unless you know exactly what to do beforehand). If you really like games like castlevania 2, or don't mind having a guide open during your playthrough, then La Mulana might be for you.

I've enjoyed La-Mulana to an extent, but not nearly enough to recommend it to anyone. You can get a good idea of how this game's like from the other reviews and I doubt I'll be able to change your mind about anything, but I do have some points that I feel haven't been emphasized enough.\n\nThe game itself is easy enough to understand: it's a Metroidvania title with heavy emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving; save for the bosses, the enemies are only there so you have something to whack as you explore the place. However, while most games hand you a cake and tell you to have fun with it, La-Mulana gives you the cake recipe in Hebraic, divided into 4 sections whose order you're not quite sure, and actively tries to stop you from getting the ingredients. La-Mulana is maddeningly hard, though very little of that difficulty comes from the actual gameplay - it's easy enough once you get used to the purposefully clunky controls. The true beast are the puzzles.\n\nThe first few areas are manageable and straightforward enough, and it's a blast to figure out a hard riddle by yourself, but as the game goes on, the game gets astoundingly open-ended, the map is of little to no use, the puzzle clues become more cryptic and spread farther apart, sometimes not even in the same area as the puzzle they're referring to, vital items are hidden behind unmarked walls, certain items can be lost forever... The great feeling of working out a couple of mysteries by yourself is slowly but surely supplanted by the feeling of being swamped by barely coherent riddles and absurd moon logic, not to mention the fact that some of the solutions require off-the-wall stuff that you have absolutely no reason to even think they'd be feasible; one of the puzzles requires you to press Down on an unmarked spot, the riddle of which mentions "you should have the courage to get down on bent knee to look for a single item", and another requires you to equip a woman's statue and do nothing on a room with a mural of a man for about 30 seconds, upon which the statue will magically get pregnant. The reasoning? "Woman within the man should be with child".\n\nLook, I love me some puzzles and puzzle games, Layton is one of my favorite series for that reason, but La Mulana quickly devolves into nonsense that I'm pretty sure NO ONE in their right mind could possibly figure out on their own. There's "tricky", and then there's "old Sierra game logic".","March 27, 2015","false","33.6"," 71 of 103 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","71","103","5","5"

It will do nothing to help you if you are stuck; everything you need is in the game in the form of tablets marked with obscure riddles or prose that you either need to find or need to decipher in the same manner as an actual archaeologist would.\n\nA great example is how I played the game for about 10 hours on my first playthrough without having found the warping item (which is in the very first area) that's absolutely necessary for decent progress.  The game didn't stop my progress and inform me that I was missing something.  In fact, aside from one dead end, I could have stumbled through the whole game without this warping item (and I'm fairly certain that with planning you could even circumvent this).\n\nEven in the midst of those 10 grueling hours (where I had to grind on enemies to heal instead of warping to the hot springs which heal you fully), I still felt La-Mulana was something very special, and that feeling greatly intensified when I started a fresh second playthrough and went further into the game.  I think it might actually be my absolute favorite 2D adventure game, and I say that as a very encompassing statement (including all your Zelda's, Metroid's, etc.).\n\nIt made me think more than even any cut-and-dry puzzle game I've ever played has made me think.  I couldn't solve all the puzzles on my own- I will readily admit that.  It doesn't do anything to diminish my opinion of the game- everything you need to solve anything is available if you have the brain and willpower to figure it out.  Some of it is incredibly obscure and difficult to figure out, but I'd imagine if you asked an actual archaeologist how hard his job is, they'd say it's a lot harder than La-Mulana (maybe this is actually a sim game?)\n\nAdd a layer of amazing combat and action on top of that, with lots of huge boss battles, and it's what I'd consider perfection.  People criticize the jumping mechanic.  That would be like criticizing the jumping in Castlevania; it's a short-sighted complaint, because the game is 100% built around the limited control.

Not even do you require good platforming skills, but you also need to be good at puzzle solving. Taking notes on your adventure is highly recommended, even if some things don't seem to be important.\n\nWith that being said about the game, let's go a little more into detail:\n\nStory:  There's barely anything to say here. You play as Lemeza Kosugi and explore ancient ruins. You find a few people close to the ruins, but only talk to their elder ever so often, he provides some advice, and later explains a few things. But there barely is more to say about the plot. But there's a lot of additional lore, and nearly every single area of the ruins has their own story to tell, if you're careful around your surroundings. After some game time, you find out that you have to kill the 8 guardians and apparently the "Mother", and that's about all you get as your target.\n\nGameplay:  Lemeza Kosugi controls pretty precisely, once you get the hang of it. Only downside is that if you walk as you jump, you can't control the jump at all anymore. If you jump while standing still it's possible though, so once you get used to it, it's okay.\nOver the course of the game, you'll find different upgrades, such as a double jump, stronger attacks, new weapons and sub-weapons. The usual things you can expect from a Metroidvania.\nThere are no lifes, once you die, it's game over. The only way to refill your HP is by either resting in the hot springs, or collecting a certain amount of life orbs, and once that life orb meter fills completely, your HP are filled up completely, and your orb meter is back to 0. You also need to collect more orbs the more HP you have.\nThere is no such thing as Experience Points and level ups, the only way to get more HP is to find their respective upgrades.\nThe normal enemies, and the areas aren't too difficult, especially once you get the ability to teleport, and you can always teleport back to the first area and refill your HP in the hot springs, though it is a little annoying.\nSpeaking of teleporting, you can teleport to certain checkpoints, where you can also save your game, pretty early in the game, so it helps moving through the ruins, since backtracking is also quite a thing here.\nThere are many mini- and mainbosses, and most of them are really, really challenging.\nEnemies also drop gold, and you actually need it to buy necessary items in the game.\n\nThose are your usual metroidvania things, but there's more here:\nFirst of all, you've got a virtual computer with you. and as you play you find software for it. You can only activate a few softwares at once. Those softwares allow simple things such as having a map, or being able to read the ancient language, up to helpful things as having more invincibility frames after being hit, or doing more damage with certain weapons.\nThen there are puzzles... They start off from rather simple things as destroying walls to reach new objects or your usual switch puzzles... up to things like understanding the ancient language partly yourself. And that's rather difficult. And saying any more would be spoiling too much. Let me just say, some of the puzzles can be extremely cryptic, and will take some time to figure out, especially because you need to solve nearly all of them to finish the game.\n\nGraphics:  Nothing special, but it all looks very well done in the 16-bit style the game is.\n\nSound:  The background music is very nice and sets the tone for each area and situation. The sound effects aren't anything special, they're okay.\n\n\nThe game will probably take about 30-40 hours in your first playthrough if you don't look anything up.\nSo, if you like the genre in any way, I'd recommend to try La-Mulana at least out for the rather cheap price!","August 17, 2014","true","76.3"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","29","35","2","0"

Subsequent playthroughs will likely lose some of the enjoyment.\n\nBut hey, that's why we're getting La-Mulana 2 soon!\n\nMy only other small gripe is the music. I love the tunes, but the majority of the mix is sustained notes that really tend to wear on the ears after awhile. They're also kinda short, so they'll be looping quite often. However, they do a great job of pumping you up for these dangerous and mysterious ruins. I just kinda wonder if the game would've been better with an ambiatic soundtrack. I suggest turning down the BGM to around 30 or so.\n\nNo doubt, the game is worth full price.

As much as it made my head hurt from trying to decipher all the cryptic clues and figuring out how to progress, I enjoyed the steep difficulty curve this game's puzzles provided, for the most part.  The teleporter mazes can just go die in a fire, along with the penultimate puzzle of the game (and it was toned down from the original version too, so that really says something abou its difficulty), but other than that I had a blast with the game's puzzles.  The areas themselves aren't too bad in terms of surviving, but the bosses will push you to the limit of how well you've mastered the game's mechanics and combat.  By the time you reach the third boss, the kiddie gloves are off and it gets real tough, real quick.\nIf you like your games very non-linear with brutal puzzles and some really tough combat, you'll enjoy this game.  It's kind of like a 2D Dark Souls in a way, drops you into the ruins with little to no information, and you're on your own from there.\nIf spending hours retracing your steps looking for what new paths that upgrade you just picked up opened up, or just what that seemingly useless item does isn't something that sounds like a good time, then this may not be the game for you.","September 3, 2015","true","53.0"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

The developers of La-Mulana wondered how games like Super Metroid, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and a plethora of other adventure games on other systems such as the MSX Home Computer would be like now if they were still in production today. (Dark/Demon's Souls is a great example of this genre in a 3D format albeit not nearly as intricate as La-Mulana) While none of the ideas in La-Mulana are exactly innovative or ground breaking the game excels as it takes the best qualities of its precursors and builds upon them while doing its best to rid itself of the negative qualities that plagued its predecessors. The best comparison would be to that of a Quentin Tarantino movie, a film buff making movies for movie fans the topics and concepts of which not original, however it takes the best aspects of its influences, constructs upon them and adds a dash of personality to them which in the end makes the experience feel fresh and gratifying as opposed to a copy paste.\n\nThe controls for La-Mulana are tight and responsive yet not free-form and allowing for correction like Super Castlevania IV, instead each action must be deliberate and precise. Boss fights follow a pattern design and can be prove to be challenging however the game provides an option for players that lack the motor skills to overcome the boss battles, by collecting the in-game currency the player can purchase a revolver and some ammunition which can be used to dispatch the tougher baddies rather easily. The lore is infused with the puzzles of the game and the back story explains itself as you go about playing the game. What makes La-Mulana such a great game is its exploration and brilliant puzzle design. This is very much so a pen and paper game, the player must have keen attention to detail and write notes on every discrepancy in order to solve its demanding puzzles. La-Mulana is not a direct game, it does not hold your hand, it thrusts you out into the game where you are required absorb information at your own pace. The puzzles may not seem coherent at first due to how little guidance the player is given on top of how cryptic the puzzles tend to be, I often found myself rubbing my head wondering if I missed a detail or whether I was just thick but eventually with enough perseverance and dedication I was able to get the gears spinning in my brain once more. This game will stick with you as you go about your daily activities mulling over what detail you may have missed in La-Mulana. It's hard to call La-Mulana a difficult game as it is more demanding and challenging. It won't beat you into the ground until you achieve victory covered in your own guts like Ninja Gaiden on the NES (or the 3D iterations). Instead you'll find yourself bewildered and confused trying to figure out what it is you need to do in order to get your head out of your keister and progress.\n\nLa-Mulana is up there in my favorite games of all time and has been one of the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had in gaming. I would have to say the target audience for La-Mulana would be gaming aficionados who have been at the hobby for a long time and have surpassed every other obstacle placed in front of them. While I wouldn't suggest this for a more casual or leisure player I do believe it is a game everyone should try at least once.","November 4, 2014","true","97.5"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","2"

The controls are very strange, with movement being very jerky and not my usual thing, but I got used to it and was enjoying it despite. I was happily wandering the ruins, solving puzzles, and slaying monsters.\n\nI fought a boss while riding through caves on a cart, Ellmac, which was pretty difficult and frustrating but I figure that was my fault for doing it (probably) so early with such poor gear, so it gets a pass. I die after him though in the new area so I figure I'll come back later.\n\nSo far the game was shaping up to be better than I expected! I was wondering where I should go next, so I figured I'd head to the Temple of Moonlight. I'd found it before but always died early inside it, so I was putting it off.\n\nIn I go and I get to dungeoneering. Can't attack while inside? Got it. New items, puzzles, and all that jazz... great! But where's the save point? I was very close to death when I finally found it. Phew!\n\nNow how do I get out of this place? I spend maybe an hour or so wandering the areas I'd already been, finding a secret weapon, but can't for the life of me figure out how to escape. I love playing games blind, so I leave the game for a bit to ruminate on the area and see if I can think of something I missed.\n\nWhen I come back, I explore everything one last time, smacking all the walls and trying my best to find anything I missed. Eventually I break, and I have to look up what the deal is. It shouldn't be so hard to leave the area - after all, I have the map, so I know where all the rooms are...\n\nI'm permanently stuck in the Temple of Moonlight because I didn't pick up the Holy Grail earlier. Apparently there are several locations in the game where this can happen. In a game about exploration, you can get permanently stuck for apparently exploring in the wrong order. The game doesn't indicate that one area should be explored before another, or that you have to have this item before you should continue on. The item is hidden too, a puzzle that I had seen but was unable to solve and put off until later.\n\nHow is this acceptable design? I was enjoying the game despite the other flaws, but that crosses a line. Maybe it's a fundamental difference in the way Japanese and Westerners design and enjoy their games, but I don't have the time or want to be forced to restart a long-winded game due to game breaking scenarios that are beyond my control.\n\nIf you are new to La-Mulana, get the Holy Grail before you explore anywhere, or your game might just end early... and you'll be left very wanting.","February 5, 2015","false","7.6"," 100 of 161 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","100","161","6","0"

Compared to it, nearly all of titles you can find with this tag are oldschool straightforward platformers. La-Mulana collects all defining staples and takes them to the extreme. Non-linear exploration, where nobody direct you by hand and you are free to choose your own walkthrough. Uniquely designed and atmospheric locations, with few features used more than once. Puzzles, not limited to "move that crate to this button", but requiring to look for scattered hints and think of undocumented abilities. Tons of monsters, items, skills, traps, secrets. An absolute feel of being an adventurer, a discoverer, a researcher.\nIt's a wonderful game. It leaves you with your own skills and challenges them in every way possible.

Yes you die often, but this game never gets lame or something, you always want to continue an go further.\n\nYou can compare La-Mulana with Spelunky, the basic is nearly the same, but La-Mulana has more details in it and you can save where you want and don't have to repeat the same level over and over again just because you die, so I definitely prefer La-Mulana.\n\nThe graphic: It looks like the graphic of an retro game (maybe NES or something) but I think this makes the game just more lovelier.

The game has its entire lore which never really comes into much of the logic needed when handling these nonsense puzzles.\n\nThe most steadfast fans of this game laud these puzzles as only for the most hardcore, but I'm not particularly sure that is so much a positive attribute of this game as it is being an apoligist. You do not succeed in this game by being intelligent so much as just having a lot of time on your hands.

Anyhow...\n\nLa-Mulana is a beautifully made game (esp. environment art, music, boss design) and has a lot of fun aspects, but in my opinion it ultimately falls victim to its own sense of smugness. I actually didn't mind the control scheme, which is essentially a modified version of Castlevania's, with weapon-specific timing, pushback when getting hit, and unalterable directional jumping (except when descending from a standstill jump). It's pretty easy to get used to if you've played enough games of that era.\n\nI also don't mind many of the "puzzles" (which I think could be more accurately described as riddles). What ended up nudging me toward not recommend the game was the implementation of the riddles. After about the third or fourth areas, you start finding heaps of increasingly cryptic clues that won't be introduced for nearly another whole half of the game and often refer to far-off places (also true for many diases and events which trigger distant environment changes that you subsequently have to hunt for). This is the main design element that necessitates the tedious manual note-taking that the developer gleefully encourages. It also has the effect of (rather artifically) increasing the game's perceived difficulty. To me, this didn't really have the seemingly intended effect of inspiring the required devotion of time and manual energy to figure out most of the game on my own, but instead kinda transformed the experience into what increasingly felt like a menial task. Very glad that there are a variety of guides to reduce the tedium, otherwise my patience would have worn off long before finishing the game.\n\nGlad I got it on a good sale.

It is meticulously detailed in every nook and cranny, gorgeously diverse areas with a wonderful pixel art aesthetic, and sublime mythology. And a ♥♥♥♥ing incredible soundtrack. It is clear to me that this is a game born out of love for the medium. It is an incredible experience for anyone willing to give it a shot.\n\nIn La-Mulana, you play as an archeology teacher named Lemenza Kosugi, and you explore a metroidvania style labrinyth called La-Mulana. La-Mulana is not an easy game, but not in the conventionally difficult manner that you expect in mechanics driven games like Dark Souls or Dustforce. The puzzles are the hard part, not the combat (though the combat does have some pretty difficult battles it's nothing compared to the puzzles). La-Mulana asks an awful lot of the player's critical and abstract thinking skills and is best played with a notebook next to you jotting down connections between what a puzzle tablet tells you and how it relates to another environment of the ruins. It's best to take a record of every tablet you come across that seems like it could answer a puzzle, as it cuts back on backtrack time. The game is tailor made for intuitive individuals; by this I mean people who easily draw connections between ideas and easily see 'hidden meaning' behind related strings of text or imagery. It's a game that asks the player to view it holistically- you must understand the iconography and backstory of the labryinth to progress further into the game. You can't get by with just combat prowess. If you're looking for a Metal Gear Rising, this is not it. La-Mulana's combat isn't complex.\n\nOnce you get into the mind-first groove of La-Mulana, it becomes an experience so ridiculously satisfying and detailed that it's hard not to fall in love. The first hours will throw you off because the game feels fairly unconventional, but once you learn to think in riddles like the game wants you to, its absolutely wonderful. La-Mulana is a game made entirely of 'Aha!' moments that happen every 15 minutes.\n\nIf I were to sum up La-Mulana, I'd do it like so.\nLa-Mulana is a game that will reject you, kick you in the face, spit on you, laugh at your failure, giggle as it throws cryptically worded puzzles at you, and congratulate you for finally figuring out how its cryptic puzzles operate. And then it makes the puzzles much more complex and laughs at you again. But it's all in good fun! Difficulty is what makes games interesting. If a game is not very hard, you'll probably get bored, right?\n\nI will warn that La-Mulana is not a game for the impatient gamer. The game is around 40-45 hours long, and much of that time will be spent in anguish that you're missing a crucial detail of a puzzle or failing to comprehend a sentence. If you're not willing to sit down and understand how the game works, it's going to be an absolutely terrible experience for you. It's not going to be fun at all. If you're the type of gamer who doesn't like often obtuse directions, then La-Mulana will be infurating and you'll probably trash it within 4 hours. You might even go on a message board and say the game isn't even worth a dollar, but we both know that's not true!\n\nI implore the impatient to stick with it. It's ♥♥♥♥ing great. Better than Super Metroid great, and it takes an awful lot to be better than Super Metroid.\n\nPlay it. And not for a dollar like they offer in sales either, pay full price for it. It's worth it.\n\nIf there's one thing I don't like about the remake compared to the original, I'd say the soundtrack is slightly weaker in the remake. Perhaps that's because I'm biased to the bleeps and bloops. It's fixable with some modulation and a quick google search, however.","March 21, 2014","true","23.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

YOU are (probably) NOT an archeologist.\n\nAnd even if you were, the (extremely well written) mythology is entirely made up.\n\nYou will NEED a notepad. You see, there is a reason why the best guide for this game is a wiki. I cannot imagine a single person ever figuring this game out by themselves.\n\nThis is the kind of game that will tell you some obscure mythological hint about, for example, where to find a key. The key is "where the woman points to the star." You will find ANOTHER tablet in ANOTHER zone that will say "the goddess of the sun shows herself as a snake." And yet it an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ZONE you will find ANOTHER mural of a snake pointing towards the sun, which is a star. BOOM. That's all the help you'll get, then of course you need to navigate to where the hell you're going to get that item. You might need three items to break the block to reveal the murals that need to be read in a specific order in an entirely different made up language.\n\nYou see, I clocked in 14:44:26 hours... in game.\n\nMy ACTUAL time was 40 hours. 14 hours is a testament to how many times I died/had to reset.\n\nHowever.

This game requires patience, determination, memory, and puzzle-solving skills above all else.\nThe combat is simple but solid; Initially, you are only provided with a whip with which to dispatch a vast array of enemies and bosses, but later you unlock many different sub-weapons and main weapons with different attack styles.\nThe way you learn to move your character, Lemeza, over the course of the game becomes a refined art. It feels odd at first, but once you get used to the quirks, you learn how to use them to your benefit and further explore the ruins.\n\nSolving puzzles in this game feels incredibly rewarding, because often the solutions are only presented to you if you are paying very close attention to everything you encounter. It pays to have a pen and paper available to jot down every little thing you see.\n\nA word of warning: Throughout the course of this game, you may very well find yourself stuck and in need of guidance - and that's okay. It's happened to me, plenty. If you find yourself in this situation, rather than find a complete walkthrough, it's best if you use it to find the solution to one or two major puzzles which will hopefully then point you in the right direction to continue your adventuring unaided. You can always backtrack later, once you've gotten well and truly stuck again.\n\nIf you purchase La-Mulana then you should keep in mind that it can be very frustrating, especially at the beginning, but if you persevere you will find that this is actually a beautifully constructed game with plenty of love and attention to detail poured into it.\nDefinitely worth getting.","September 26, 2015","true","37.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

It's definitely not for everyone. Its a great action platformer, and a great puzzler, but the combination of the two is what makes it genius. If difficult, often-bizzare puzzles are not for you, the game stands on it's own as an action platformer, as you can just look up the solutions to the puzzles (this should be avoided though, if possible - the puzzles are part of the greatness).\n\nThe music is gorgeous. The artwork is gorgeous (particularly minibosses/bosses). Animation is great. Writing is great - game is both very dark, yet full of humor.\n\nThis game is literally worth $200. $15 is a steal. If you enjoy platformers, and don't mind putting on your thinking cap (and bringing along a pen and paper to take notes!), you should stop reading this and just buy it, you won't regret it.\n\nThere are not many games of this genre that truly last 30-50 hours. I cannot think of one. The value is immense.\n\nEdit:So 9 months later - oh my god. La-Mulana. The greatest. Still, I wanted to touch on something that I briefly mentioned in my initial review, but didn't elaborate enough into.[/b]\n\nWhen it comes to La-Mulana, you either 'get it' or you don't. Now don't get me wrong - it's got nothing to do with how "sophisticated" one's tastes are or anything like that. Those arguments are always meaningless. Rather, La-Mulana is a flawed game in many aspects.\n\nI know plenty of people who don't dig the game, and they can usually list off a bunch of minor (but valid) gripes. Sometimes, someone might even have a major criticism regarding the design of the game. I'll be honest - I end up discounting those opinions of just not 'getting it', since they're usually related to the fundamental design of the game ("It's like, too big and confusing, and they don't give any direction").\n\nWhile I'm not a fan of those crticisms, I absolutely can acknowledge others. It is true - the game is not for everyone, like I said at the start. You might not like it for perfectly valid reasons. Now if you do like it? You will love it. It'll literally blow your mind, like it blew mine.\n\nIt seems to me that most people either play 4 hours or less of La-Mulana, or they play 30+ hours. Again - you 'get it' or you don't. Movies and other forms of media can be the exact same way - some people will walk out of a film that others will watch hundreds of times. On top of that, this is a cult classic we're dealing with. Expect most fans who love it to rave about it, and nearly everyone else to not understand what all the fuss is about.\n\nAs far as raving goes, here's mine:\n\nThink -  have you ever loved something so much that you're almost frustrated that more people don't understand how incredible it is? Movies, books, songs, games... you name it - I'm sure there's something that you feel that way about. That's how I feel about La-Mulana. To me, it is the most incredible, genius, outstanding, "best game of all time" contending game I've played in years.\n\nI implore everyone to at least check this out (ideally when it's on sale for like $3, even though I think it's worth $200), see if it's for you. Most people probably won't be into it. They  won't dislike the game - they'll just be indifferent. "Eh, it's good, but I don't see why it's the greatest game of all time and could possibly be the messiah in gaming form." Perfectly understandible - but if you are among us few who's brains are for some reason wired to adore this twisted monster of a game, it might literally change your life.","September 1, 2014","true","79.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

(TLDR see bottom)\n\nThere is no question in my mind that this game is very well polished and complete in its entirety. It has an awesome soundtrack, excellent platforming elements, a wide-array of weapons, and the few characters in the game are very loveable.\n\nLa-Mulana puzzles are deliberately unfair, obscure, and require either a RIDICULOUS amount of hours (I am talking like... 100+), or the use of a FAQ to finish without going insane. It is a Japanese Platformer, meaning the game requires utter devotion from you, or some outside knowledge to enjoy completely.\n\nLet me outline this for you - unless you want the make La-Mulana the thesis statement of your life you WILL NOT beat it without a FAQ or without help - here's why:\n\n-The game starts off completely solvable (I managed to clear many of the first areas without help)\n-Puzzles remain contained AT FIRST, limiting solutions and "cause and effect" action to within zones\n-The game VERY long for a platformer.\n\nThings obscure as READING something in one part of the ruins may unlock an entire way to go in another part. It's true, the game drops all sorts of hints and things, and it is definitely possibly to trace some sort of information to almost every puzzle... but let's face it - are you really going to remember a sentence of text you read at hour 5 for hour 55? Of course the logical solution would be then to write it down - I did that... my word document is roughly twenty pages (single spaced) long. Even Ctrl-F can't save me from my own notes!\n\nBut at the end of the day I can't really dislike La-Mulana for being frustrating... that's kind of why I bought it in the first place. One thing that drove me crazy is that although you have awesome platforming abilities in the game, it is ultimately a puzzle game, meaning those abilities are often left on the pause screen while you pull out your hair thinking of how to progress further. On the bright side, all of the bosses and enemy placement seems to be excellent.\n\nSo if you are in the mood to spend endless hours (I am serious... 100+) wandering some virtual hallways jiving to some catchy music, you may just be THAT person who beats La-Mulana without a FAQ. Or... being rational, you can swallow your pride, progress as far as possible alone, and then use a FAQ whenever hope is lost.\n\nI enjoyed this game; but I wouldn't only recommend it the majority with the use of a FAQ.\n\nTLDR: Game's really long, esoteric puzzles, good music, good enemies, tediously frusterating.","March 22, 2015","true","40.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

But that's just the thing: This game, despite my utter hatred for it, still left a deep impact (or stab wound rather) on me and it has become essential for me to voice my opinion.\n\nWhat is there to say that hasn't already been said about the controls? They're downright awful. Lemeza floats like a butterfly when he jumps, but carries the momentum of a cannonball when you flutter over to the next screen. Often times, this led me to smash the arrow keys in the opposite direction in a futile attempt to correct my ever so graceful jump and avoid unforseen hazards. Unfortuantely for Lemeza, he would only look the other direction as he was flung into a lava pool or spike pit.\n\nHowever, strangely enough, if you jump straight up into the air, then use WASD mid jump, you become liberated from these cruel forces of momentum. Apparently, Nigoro wasn't going for realistic jump physics then, so what's the point of punishing the player for taking mandated leaps of faith?\n\nI could go on about the controls (frequently, I would reset from my last save point than try to get out of water or lava. It was just simpler than trying to jump out of the liquids) but I need to talk about the actual origin of this game. You see, I'm with Nigoro for bringing back challening, MSX-era puzzle platformers. I love games like this. However, if you want to resuscitate the genre (and do a remake no less!), there's no need to keep primitive controls, limited save points, unforgiveably bad physics, and, possibly the worst offender, long walks back to boss fights. When I lose to a boss, I want to get right back into the fight, not drag my knuckles in shame across seven screens (Usually taking damage before the fight, and maybe failing a few platform jumps) to have another go. There is so little polish in these details that it's offensive. They are hideous warts on an already dead and bloated frog.\n\n\nAs long as I'm talking about boss fights, why is it that they feel so unrewarding? Most games of this genre will offer you a new weapon or health upgrade after sticking it to one of these big baddies. What's the usual boss reward in La-Mulana? An unlocked door in a far flung corridor, or a shortcut leading to somewhere you've already been. Not to mention that nearly every boss in this game is a variation on "Equip best weapons and whack them in the face". Sure, the bosses are visually appealing and they terrifyingly tower over Lemeza, but when I can scour the ruins for all the health ups (or just use the ♥♥♥♥ing gun! Why on earth would you include a super powerful weapon like this? Once the player farms money, they can pay their way through boss fights!) and fling myself over and over at the guardins until they submit, it doesn't feel rewarding in the least. In fact, it proves again how little polish went into this game.\n\nI don't want to talk about the puzzles in the La-Mulana too much; The game itself certainly doesn't address them. If you want to solve most of these esoteric and far fetched enigmas, you're probably going to wind up on the FAQ, which, in adventure games, I consider to be the equivalent of inviting a sweaty man from the internet come over and help you pee. It IS indeed an apt comparision because puzzles should flow naturally into the game, not impede you until you figure out the solution. I get that this was common in past eras of gaming, but we've since grown up. It's another blemish on the bronze aged face of gaming that can remain in antiquity.\n\nAnd when you do cave to use the FAQ, the solution to the puzzle in your way will cause you to exclaim one of two things:\n\n"That's so simple, how could I not figure that out!?"\n\nOr\n\n"How are you supposed to know this!?"\n\n\nAll in all, La-Mulana will make your blood boil and fill your swear jar. It's not a game: It's a chore. A highly complicated chore that just doesn't feel worth doing. Like giving a playground bully an emergency appendectomy only to have him kick sand in your eye afterwards.\n\nPlay the original game on an emulator; You'll conserve a lot of time and frustration by using save states. Not to mention that the original has throwback graphics and 8 bit music. These are the things from old gaming that have actually aged well. And get this: With simplistic graphics, some of the puzzles are actually easier in the original version since there's less clutter. They're still hard, but at least you'll feel like you're walking through a piece of history than play this version.\n\n\n","October 2, 2014","false","50.2"," 43 of 77 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","43","77","5","0"

Then La-Mulana is for you.\n\nDon't let the cute retro-style deceive you. There is deep lore hidden behind the surface, and you have to understand it in order to progress. Read all the stone tablets that are spread throughout the game, and take notes. There is no shame in asking other players for directions or even using a guide, if you have been hopelessly stuck for hours. But you will feel like an idiot afterwards, when you realize that the clues had all been laid out for you. You just didn't take them seriously. The platforming and fighting can also be very challenging at times, especially some of the later guardians.\n\nThere will be lots of backtracking, of course, but traveling through the different areas is still fun. Each area is unique. Each guardian bossfight is unique. And every puzzle is unique. You'll find yourself putting lots of weights on daises, but how you get to them is always different. Many puzzles require you to figure out clever gimmicks, only to never see them again. For other puzzles you'll have to do something in one area that affects something in a different area. The game world is also structured in a non-linear fashion. For example, you could skip the first guardian and fight the third one first, if you like (or if you simply haven't figured out, how to get to the first one...).\n\nLet me just give you one tip for the sake of your enjoyment: In the first area, the Gate of Guidance, is a treasure which allows you to warp to savepoints, and you can get it immediately. It will save you a lot of traveling time.","December 24, 2014","true","69.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

An homage, if you will. In 2010, it was remade for WiiWare, then ported back to PC.\n\nI have not played the original, so I cannot compare the two versions.\n\nIn La-Mulana you play as Lemeza Kosugi, professional Indiana Jones-style archaeologist. He was goaded by his father, Shorn, to travel to the ruins of La-Mulana in search of a legendary treasure hidden within. Lemeza arrives at the town just outside the ruin with nothing but a whip and a laptop (The Mobile Super X, totally not the MSX). Everything else he intended to bring was confiscated by airport security. Thankfully, the ruins are filled with various other treasures that serve Lemeza much better than a grappling hook and some rope ever would.\n\nI will say this now: The game is hard. Very hard. There is no hand-holding in this game. You have to purchase the ability to scan signposts, tablets, and pretty much everything else in the ruins, then a software to translate the tablets within the ruins.\n\nHowever, every puzzle's solution appears on a tablet somewhere in the ruins, though the tablet and the puzzle it relates to may not be anywhere near each other.\n\nThe controls, however, require a lot of getting used to. Lemeza controls well when he's grounded, but the midair controls are rather awkward. You have very little air control when you jump angled to the left or right. If you jump straight up, you can start moving in a direction when you reach the apex of the jump. Jumping into a wall will allow you to turn around, which makes jumping to platforms directly above or below the one you're currently on simple. Walking off of a platform without jumping prevents you from controlling your fall.\n\nGetting hit flings Lemeza backwards, and you do not regain control of him until he lands on solid ground. It's pretty annoying, because more than a few segments of the game require you to ascend. Getting hit can and will send you down several screens. Luckily, you can still use your item menu and laptop while in hitstun.\n\nAnd the most annoying: Lemeza cannot grab onto ladders in midair. You can only start climbing a ladder from the top or bottom, and getting hit while on a ladder knocks you off of it. You can abuse this to fall down a ladder quicker, but no such luck going back up.\n\nDespite the aerial movement flaws, the game is very solid. It's entertaining, and deciphering the riddles of the ruins actually requires the player to think. If you're looking for a highly challenging platformer, look no further than La-Mulana.","November 6, 2014","true","3.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The ruins of La-Mulana are absolutely massive, riddled with puzzles, traps, and bosses, and paying attention to the environment is essential to progress. Background objects can be examined, giving you vital clues about the world and the puzzles that can be found within, and note taking is highly encouraged as the hints you find may apply to puzzles on the other end of the ruins.\n\nLa-Mulana controls a bit like an early Castlevania game. Your control over your jumping trajectory is limited, and knockbacks can be brutal. You start with a whip, but as you progress through the game, you'll find lots of different weapons and subweapons you can equip, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIt is not a game for everyone, and the very beginning of the game can be especially tough if you don't know what you're up against, but if you desire a massive world to explore and a game that can give you the satisfaction of solving complex riddles without the game shoving the solution in your face, then La-Mulana might be for you. There's no shame in checking a guide every now and again, especially when you get near the end of the game, which is when the puzzles start to become quite complex, but you'll get the most enjoyment out of La-Mulana if you try to solve as many of its mysteries as you can by yourself, armed with only your wits and a collection of notes.\n\nIf you want to try La-Mulana, I definitely recommend reading through the manual, as well as watching the "Beginner's Guide to La-Mulana" video on Youtube.","September 16, 2013","true","45.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Music is catchy, and captures the mood of every location and event perfectly.\n\nControls may seem stiff at first, but the even a casual player will be able to get used to them, especially since the levels are designed around them. Some puzzles may be too tough to solve solo, and while taking notes down old school style is encouraged, some may be discouraged by the lack of taking in-game notes (bar the ability to log down a number of clues). However, none of these minor setbacks add up nor will bog a player down for long.\n\nAll explorers, Metroidvania fans, and fans of "hard" games will surely enjoy this remake of the classic indie.","April 26","true","75.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

In here, you're playing as Professor Lemeza, he's an archeologist who tried to solve the mysteries of the ruins. This game is huge and vast, and as this is a metroidvania game, expect a lot of backtrack. There will be a lot of unsolved stuff behind, and even though it looks impossible to do, it's not, you'll able to do some crazy feat once you progress. That's one of the beauty of this game. So, now on to the review !\n\n(+) Positive\n- The progressive feels real, you starts with totally nothing, but once you unlocks stuff. It actually impacts in a great way.\n- Interesting puzzle and riddle, and most of them are fair, logical and there's a hint for them.\n- The soundtracks are great, really fits the atmosphere.\n- A lot of secret, for those who likes treasure hunting.\n- The place is vast and huge, great for those who likes exploring, you may find difficulties at first though !\n- The boss fight is really challenging. Man, beating them feels great.\n\n(-) Negative\n- At the beginning, this game is kinda dull, since you're really limited. And it's kinda nuisance to go back to the first place just for healing. But later in the game, this will no longer become a problem.\n- Beware, while most of the riddle is fair, some of them are not. you might get stuck.\n- The death traps, yes, there are some in this game. There's a trap where you'll get killed instantly. Also, there's a trap that get you stucked and you'll most likely dead if you don't have a necessary item to get away. Trial and error i might say.\n\nSo, if you like a challenging 2D Action game, and don't mind dying a lot. This game is totally for you !

There has to be a better way of making these games than cryptic clues that spawn switches that alter the level several screens over. You can get walled by your ineptitude but more often than not it's because you lack an obscurely placed yet crucial item. The Birth Seal is on the surface for ♥♥♥♥s sake buried in waterfalls on a small platform that requires you to make a blind jump over a moving target that will throw your trajectory off it if collides with you. Not to mention the absurdly comvoluted steps you need to take to engage the collosus.\n\nAs the game progresses I'm certain to run into even more problems of this sort, but it's nothing the internet can't help me out with. Better design would incorpirate non-obtrusive hints into the game's patchwork, maybe a certain NPC could give you the gist of where an item you need is hiding as opposed to having me aimlessly wander around combing every single room for the few areas I can access with whichever new item I just recieved.\n\nThat said it has a wonderful lack of sequence, there is a tremendous variety in the order you can do things. This can backfire though when the first boss you run into is actually supposed to be the third and is thus stupid hard (in a game that's already stupid hard).\n\nI was really pumped about the music for the first few hours or so but having to revisit and comb over every sector so meticulously has caused the tracks to lose their charm. There's a magnificent amount of interactivity with the environment, at a depth I would not ever expect in what was a free game. Expect to die and get hit fairly often, this game is no stranger to instantly killing you on a careless spiteful whim.

I honestly want to hear how I'm wrong about this.\n\nLa-Mulana is a fantastic platforming adventure game that does not hold your hand. "The adventure begins" and that's all you get. The video on the Steam store page helps quite a bit, giving you the basic essentials to starting. From there, you spelunk a massive ruin with many cultures mixed into a great, nuanced, satisfying story.\n\nI really want to just say that I love this game, everyone should play it and learn how to be a real gamer. However, there were some frustrating points that ultimately made me drop it. That's not to say that everyone will find the same things frustrating, but I wanted to give fair warning at least.\n\nLa-Mulana has a very well designed difficulty curve for quite a while, but right around the mid-game, things get very overwhelming. A number of puzzles at that point have given you so many clues and you have so many places you can go that it becomes impossible to filter between what you can and can't solve without meticulous note-taking. I found the sheer number of things that you have to keep handy just in case a tablet somewhere hints at a room somewhere else to go beyond intimidating to the point of not being fun.\n\nA lot of things are hidden behind one completely unremarkable wall among hundreds or trial and error. At the same time I've had the most legitimate challenge that I've had in any game. I wish I could give this a neutral to say "be prepared for masochistic gaming or a walkthrough", but this is probably the closest I can get considering the majority of people. Also, my playtime is not what it appears, I've been playing collaboratively in offline mode with a friend.","February 3, 2015","false","6.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","4"

It's hard to say what they'd look like for sure, but La-Mulana is a damn good approximation.\n\nThere's hours of enjoyment to be had here for folks looking for a challenging and rewarding experience, not just another traipse around some glorified shooting galleries. You will be pushed. You will get lost. You will come close to prevailing, and you will die. Oh my word yes, you will die. But the game world is incredibly open and busy. If you get stuck in one place, you can  explore elsewhere, either to find another way to progress or to look for clues that might help you. Eventually though, with perseverance, you'll make it, and nothing can beat the feeling of overcoming a boss or puzzle that has had you stumped for far longer than you'd have liked.\n\nSimply put, if you find yourself wanting more from games, try this one.","February 11, 2014","true","12.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You play as an explorer, armed with only a whip, an Indiana Jones hat, and a strong drive for exploration. And my gosh, you really succumb to wanderlust. Diving into the ruins is rewarding in terms of music, visuals, content, and ~that warm feeling~ of nabbing yourself another sweet item/weapon/powerup to add to your ever growing arsenal. No room is used simply for the once, while this encourages backtracking, it also makes the ruins of La-Mulana feel more organic. And that's fantastic. The antagonist of the game is the game itself, you want nothing more than to beat it to a pulp, and steal its dinner money. La-Mulana is a very unforgiving game with little to no hand-holding, and I adore that. Every accomplishment your character makes, you are responsible for. You FEEL like an honest-to-god explorer. And I haven't even mentioned the puzzles. I love this game so, so much. I can feel the love and care that went into this title, slavishly improving on every aspect that was already great about the original, and it's bursting from the seams with quality content.

I gave up a few hours in, once I could no longer make any progress by myself. La-Mulana gives you almost no instructions or directions at all, just very cryptic hints that are usually impossible to understand. Some of the more annoying puzzles include invisible floors, or breakable walls that look like normal walls.  The world is so massive and has so many path branches that you’ll be backtracking for ages before you figure out what you’ve missed or where to go.\n\nEven very important key items like the map and warp system are fairly well hidden!\nI probably wouldn’t have found them for a very long time, but I checked the wiki when I got trapped in a dead-end room. There’s actually traps that force you to load your last saved game! And they don’t even tell you that you’re perma-trapped! So you have to sit there like an idiot for 15 minutes trying to get out.\n\nUgh. It’s a shame. I really would have liked to finish the game. Cause it would be awesome if it was actually playable.

La-Mulana is a classic style action adventure in the 'metroidvania' designation. A befuddling and old school experience evocative of the games that inspired it. It has no shame in allowing you to wander around its treacherous halls with only the snippets of guidance left behind on ancient stone tablets and the final thoughts of previous adventurers already taken by its depths. It makes me feel like an actual archaeologist, having to unravel the mysteries of an ancient civilization.\n\nAlmost no handholding, and the little that is there is teasing or completely ignorable.

Difficult controls. Unclear objectives. Obtuse puzzles. However, the game promises a deep adventure and a sense of accomplishment whenever you are clever enough (or lucky enough) to force your way deeper into the ruins.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pillowfight/recommended/230700/","pillowfight","pillowfight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pillowfight/","1599 products in account","I'm going to start this off by declaring that I used a guide when I got stuck, and had a map open half the time.\n\nI just beat La-Mulana. This is the most fun I've had playing a Metroidvania game in quite some time. The controls are crisp, even if the jumping will definitely feel off at the beginning. The graphics are done well in a retro 16bit style, with some throwbacks to the original release of the game that you'll see later on in it. The soundtrack however, is fantastic. Very catchy tunes, with each area having its own music. I've held off on listening to the soundtrack in full, but it's going to be a joy to listen to it having beaten the game.\n\nGameplay is traditional Metroidvania, with a twist. You don't actually level up, instead relying on various items you run around in the ruins to get more powerful. "Leveling up" instead refills your health, which is much needed. The game is also puzzle heavy, which is why I ended up using the guide (some can be rather obtuse, and some near impossible unless you remember a specific thing or can figure out the crazy Japanese logic used in their creation.) The difficulty of the game is something I had heard about before I started, and I can agree, it's definitely a difficult game. However it's a very fair difficult for the most part. If you get stuck in an area you can learn the patterns of the enemies or bosses, or even come back later after exploring other areas. There were several rooms that I did get frustrated in, but that was due to the nature of my skills not matching up with what the game asked of me. When you die you can typically learn why you died and then find a way to not die next time.\n\nIf you like Metroidvania games and don't mind a tough but fair game, you owe it to yourself to play this gem. Even though the puzzles are obtuse at times, if you don't want to use a guide the game does give you plenty of tools to help you to figure them out yourself. You can record conversations to read back later, try various combinations of items, or simply brute force if needed. The puzzles are essentially the only flaw I found in this otherwise sterling game. I'm so glad I stuck with it after getting my ♥♥♥ kicked at the beginning.\n\nOh, and you have a whip.","November 25, 2013","true","32.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deburgo/recommended/230700/","deburgo","DeBurgo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deburgo/","545 products in account","Really, really amazing game. If you want a super-deep "metroidvania" type game, buy this game. If you want a Dark Souls-style level of difficulty and attention in your games, play this. It's pretty great.\n\nSo, having beaten it I still recommend it. However, I do have to add one serious caveat, which I'll elaborate on in this review: There's no two ways about it. The puzzles in this game are unfair. Which is fine, because you can use wikis or forums or FAQs. However, I would not try to tackle this on your own. If NOT using outside means, prepare to be frustrated, or at least be challenged like you've never been challenged before. In my very short summary above (which I wrote a while ago but keep here for honesty), I referenced "Dark Souls," but that's not very accurate, since it does not really live up to that game's "tough but fair" reputation. La Mulana is tough, and it isn't fair.\n\nOne of the big problems with the puzzles in this game is that all the hints are distributed on various tablets. There's very little rhyme or reason to where tablets are distributed. The game often presents hints for puzzles that occur near the end of the game once you progress past the first area of the ruins. The positive side of this is that you really feel like an archaeologist exploring ruins -- the precursors didn't place most of these tablets for your own convenience, nor did they place them perfectly in sync with your progress through the ruins. The negative side is that it makes solving puzzles a pretty unpleasant task. There is software in the game that allows you to record tablet text and conversation, but it has a very small memory of about 10-20 messages. You'll have to take your own notes (or refer to a wiki, like I did) if you want to track and organize the practically novel-length amount of text the game throws at you.\n\nThere's a text highlighting system that somewhat alleviates the confusion, but it will probably take you most of beginning of the game to figure out the system (I'll save you some time by telling you about it: Blue text refers to rooms, areas, and objects. Green text refers to items you can pick up in your inventory. Yellow text refers to software functions. Red text refers to bosses and sub-bosses). Compound that with the fact that a lot of the hints aren't exactly straightforward -- they are hints, after all -- and you've a pretty nasty set of puzzles.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of puzzles where no obvious hints exist. Many times you'll just need to hit nearby walls and hope you aren't electrocuted by the eye of retribution. This object is an oft-present relief of an eye is built into many parts of the ruins. It shoots extremely damaging lightning bolts at adventurers that hit "sacred" objects in the ruins with their weapons. It also zaps them for breaking various arbitrary, unwritten rules. So, the lesson of destroyable blocks in La-Mulana seems to be go ahead and hit stuff, but just don't hit the wrong stuff. You'll die.\n\nBosses and sub-bosses also will give your explorer a hard time. A large part of the game involves usually a lot of self-examination over whether you've solved enough puzzles to be prepared for the tough battles. Unlike the puzzles, though, most of the bosses are quite fair once you're properly equipped for them. Mercifully, the game also provides a pistol that players can use. While ammo for this weapon is scarce and expensive, there's just enough ammo in the game to take the edge off of the most frustrating bosses. The trick is not to waste it on the game's many sub-bosses and common enemies.\n\nFinally, while it wasn't a huge problem for me, some people have a problem with the platforming mechanics. The mechanics are actually pretty simple, albeit unusual. Your character, Professor Lemeza, does not have the same amount of control as, say, Mario. Specifically he can control his degree of ascent by the amount of time the jump button is pressed, but any time he jumps across his downward arc is set. However, if Lemeza jumps straight upward, or jumps across and hits an obstacle, he has some control over his descent, starting at the point where he reaches the apex of his jump. This is enough to turn off some people, but, honestly, if you look at the history of metroidvanias, many are not known for having tight controls. Samus always had that ♥♥♥♥ed up floaty jump. Alucard moved faster backwards than he did in his forward run. Strange control quirks are abound in this genre. Plus, later on you get some items that hopefully make field traversal less painful for most players.\n\nAll that said, I still strongly recommend the game! It's an incredible experience, and an extremely impressive, intricate, and clever game. I think a lot of people under-value just how hard it is to craft a game like this, and how rare they are. Even though I said a lot of the puzzles are unfair, there is an internal logic to 99 percent of them (a couple are garbage, but the game is massive -- it's allowed a few misses), it's just the game often does not feel like it has to reveal that logic to you all at once.","April 19, 2013","true","51.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Think of it as if Castlevania, Dark Souls, Pitfall, and every single anime cliche stepped into a teleporter pod at the same time and La-Mulana came out alive in a shambling mass from the other pod.\n\nSo be warned; La-Mulana is not for the faint of heart. This game will challenge you with NES-hard difficulty and complex puzzles that both punishes and rewards the devoted gamer. Monsters and bosses are tough nuts to crack, but many of them have set patterns and drop XP that can fill your health bar to full whenever you collect enough.\n\nThere are a lot of hints and clues scattered all throughout the game to solve almost every puzzle, either through tablet stones lying around, murals in the background, or dialogue with NPCs. However, the clues are very cryptic to grasp and most clues are for puzzles you'll run into hours later, making it really easy to be stuck in a certain area for extensive periods of time. But you know what? That's what gets me hooked onto La-Mulana; it's the authentic archaeological experience to solve ancient riddles and avoid booby traps along the way. And when you finally solve a major puzzle or get past a difficult spot, that sigh of relief feels like heaven.\n\nAll in all, La-Mulana is a very fluid and heavily underrated masterpiece that takes platform gamers to the limit. Many people might find frustration with the game's tough puzzles and enemies, but to the indomitable spirited gamer, La-Mulana will offer a very thrilling and unique experience not found in many games of yesteryear or today.\n\n+ Interesting platformer with large non-linear levels, a deep story, cute characters, and endless challenges\n+ Retro-style indie game that does more than imitates classic games that preceded decades before it\n+ Beautifully detailed graphics compared to the original\n+ Completing most challenges and defeating bosses can occur in any order; La-Mulana's non-linear structure makes getting to the very end obtainable from many different paths\n+ Perfect for those who love to solve intriguing puzzles, battle unique bosses, and just straight up play a challenging but rewarding game\n+ Will enrich your cultural knowledge with mythological folklore borrowed from the real world!\n\n- Hard-as-balls default difficulty with an even harder one that could be unlocked during gameplay\n- Jumping mechanics are difficult to nail down for beginners and takes much practice to master\n- Most typical La-Mulana puzzles are more obscure to solve than the meaning of life itself\n- No seriously, this game will kick you straight in the butt crack; there's no shame in using community guides for this game!","January 6, 2014","true","91.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

La-Mulana is an Indiana Jones/Metroidvania that takes back the old school difficulty with todays gameplay.

The traps will kill you, the puzzles will stump you. The difficulty of the puzzles give a great sense of satisfaction once you figure it out, and the traps keep you on the edge of your seat often.\n\nLa-Mulana is rich with archaeologic referances and has an indepth story through discovery. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzles and platforming. However, there are a couple breaking bugs that may be encountered. Specifically in the Moon and Hell temples. There is a glitch that can get you stuck into the floor if jumping into a platform or floor a particular way. Failure to escape will warp you to the surface. Not usually a problem to be sure, however, if you are fighting a boss and this happens, you will be unable to warp or resummon said boss.

Although I still need to play the Steam version more, I've played the original extensively.\n\nPositives: This is an excellent nod to classic MSX games, particularly the Maze of Galious.  But I think it's better designed than those games in many ways.  The graphics in the original look right out of a MSX game and are lovingly crafted.  You might fear that the updated graphics for the Steam version would lose some of their charm, but luckily the original creator worked on them and they still look great.  Now they look more like a Super Nintendo game, which works perfectly well.  The same is also true for the music, a lot of care was taken to make sure it retains the charm of the original soundtrack.\n\nThe game itself is excellent.  Having played both versions, I have to say that the Steam versions smoothes over a few problems with the original version and makes it even better.  One excellent addition is the ability to save all the notes you've read in an in game journal; while I kind of enjoyed keeping a written journal of notes when I played the original game, it's certainly easier this way.  The puzzles themselves have been smoothed over a bit, to be a bit more fair and a little easier to figure out.  But they are still by no means easy.  The puzzle design is very good, with a lot of clever puzzles.\n\nAlthough they toned down the puzzles a bit, they compensated for this by increasing the game's skill based difficulty.  This is a good change.  In the original game, it often felt like health didn't matter, and bosses were a bit too easy to steamroll through.  Now your health meter matters a bit more.  The difficulty is still not a big deal, as the ability to warp renders many of the challenges moot, but it's a welcome change none the less.\n\nNegatives: Although I like the updated graphics and music, it does lose a bit of it's MSX feel that the original version had.  So, if you are a big fan of the MSX, I would encourage you to check out the original version, which is still available and free.  Also, while I think that all the puzzles are fair and solvable, some of them are very devious and a bit vague.  And you will likely need to do a lot of wandering around, and trial and error.  Many people will probably need to resort to a guide to finish this game.\n\nOverall: This game does a great job of making you feel like an archeologist.  The ruins you are exploring feel mysterious, the puzzles are clever and memorable.  The music really sets a great tone for the game and will stay with you after you've played.  This is not only one of the best love letters to classic games ever made, but it's one of the best indie games ever made.

It's your job to not only find your father, but uncover the secrets of La-Mulana.\n\nThis game features lots of devious, head scratching puzzles, tough and challenging boss battles and enough dubious traps to make you think the game REALLY doesn't like you.

This first field also serves as an old school tutorial: you will learn the mechanics of the game within it, to recognize some traps and to doubt others. It's also really great as you can complete almost everything in the first field without ever going elsewhere, even beating its boss.\n\nOnce you've beat the first boss and completed most of the field's puzzles, it's time to branch out into the real game. Now you will begin the real exploration! You will need to visit many areas before being able to complete one, only stopped by a lack of tools or by too powerful enemies. The hints, which were pretty self-contained in the first field, will be found pretty much anywhere.\n\nThis game is really great and I heartly recommand it. Warning tough: the jumping controls are stiff and need a little adaptation. You might also want to consider a pen and paper to take note of some hints early on - until you find an in-game software you can use for that. Besides the accumulation of orbs, the hot spring is the only way to regain health.\n\nWhat I think is the most amazing thing is how understanding the lore is primordial to understand and solve the puzzles. Through its tablet hints and other environmental cues, the game has a lore to tell and recurring themes that become more and more the key to find some of the later solutions. The "second" field, Mausoleum of the Giants, introduce the concept quite forcefully, even though most of its lore puzzles can be brute-forced without much trouble.\n\nAs usual with this kind of game, you start off really weak but if you commit yourself to find everything, you will become almost overpowered by the game's end, so don't be put off by the initial difficulty (or maybe you should come back with a better weapon or more health).","December 29, 2015","true","77.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game's good points do really shine and make it at least worth a look - for one the game is massive with over 20 different areas to explore, and each of them filled with lots of truly unique puzzles and secrets. The game's soundtrack and art design is also very good, and while I'm not a huge fan of the cartoony style in favor of the more realistic look of games like Castlevania and Metroid, I can overlook this.\n\nAs many others have said though the extremely cryptic nature of the puzzles can be a big turn-off, as well as the fact that the game gives you almost no information about what to do or where to go next. This means that most players won't be able to progress withoutt using a guide. There are also a few cheap instances in which the player can simply become stuck due to running out of certan items, or due to getting caught in certain traps which they'd have no way of knowing about in advance - and if you haven't collected a special item then your only option is to reset the game and lose your progress.\n\nHowever the most flat-out annoying flaw for me is the controls. The jumping mechanics in the game are unnecessarily stiff and clunky and make the boss fights especially frustrating and not all that fun.\n\nStill I have to give this game crops for its creativity and making an effort to be challenging unlike many commercial games. I probably will never devote the time to finishing it but overall I still enjoyed what little of it I played.","September 19, 2015","true","122.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So do not feel ashamed about pulling out a guide cause it is just going to make it so much more enjoyable.\n\nSome of the puzzles are pretty funny (and mean) and honestly the platforming and battles of this game are pretty fun too. There is one boss in particular that is one hell of a ride (but I won't spoil it for you.... its awesome tho). This game is incredibly difficult and extremely unforgiving and even the achievements poke fun at how brutal they are being to the player.... you know what the scary thing is?

But eventually you will get to a point where it is literally impossible to solve some of the puzzles without looking stuff up on the internet. I have 38 hours played, so i was probably stuck for 20+ hours trying to find a way to continue but what i had to do to progress was "stand in random spots and press the item button", sure you could argue that there were stone tablets that gave me hints how to get into "eden" but what about the gate of illusion teleport puzzles, or the location of the book of dead, or the fact that a random gate appears on the surface after killing a random boss.\n\nAfter getting through eden/the gate of illusion with a guide i decided that i'm done with this game and i won't finish it. The gameplay isn't very enjoyable, the bosses in the early game are all easy (despite me accidently playing on hardmode) and the bosses in the mid-lategame can almost all be cheesed with the lamp.\n\nI eventually watched a video of a speedrun for this game and in the later parts you have to do a lot more random stuff for example in the tower of godess and in the shrine of the mother. One of the puzzles is stand 45 seconds in a room for the doll to change, another is randomly look at the upgraded map at a specific location in the shrine of the mother and i don't even want to talk about the final puzzle.\n\nI don't mind hard games, i don't mind difficult puzzles but this game has too much random stuff without reasonable hints. I wouldn't have complained about cryptic puzzles for bonus items and whatnot, but a lot of the unreasonable puzzles are required to progress and finish the game.","January 1","false","38.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I'd highly suggest this game for those up for the challenge.

This remake retaines all of the 'real' difficulty present while cutting out the fake difficulty, and makes it feel more like a Super NES game than a MSX game.   The controls are remappable and are responsive, althought the jump physics take time to get used to, being Mega Man Physics for standing jumps and being more like Castlevania I-III for moving jumps.  The game's puzzles are fun, but tricky and some can be failed for the remainder of that run so be very careful and do not rush.\n\nI have to give this game a positive review.  It's a good Metroidvania that is welcome after the dissapointments in the two big names in that Genre, and I eagerly await the sequel.","March 5, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

La-Mulana is a game in the same vein as titles such as "Castlevania: Symphony of the Night", "Super Metroid", and "Cave Story." These types of games are generally associated with the term "Metroidvania's." La-Mulana is a side-scrolling action platformer, that includes non-linear progression, an inventory system, skill-based combat, and many, many puzzles. What sets La-Mulana apart from other games in the genre are the insanly difficult puzzles (some might even say diabolical). Unless you are a super-human, expect to get stuck many times and be forced to look up a guide on how to progress through the game. Nigoro did an excellent job remaking the original La-Mulana, adding beautiful sprite graphics, and quirky humor that many will enjoy.

It has an incredibly deep and meaningful plot, crazy awesome boss battles, a top-notch soundtrack, incredibly satisfying puzzles, and an unbelievable attention to detail. The old freeware version had a pretty user unfriendly UI and the graphics, no matter their charms, could make a lot of things hard to notice. The remake pretty much clears up all of that and makes a few of the more obtuse puzzles slightly friendlier.\n\nLa-Mulana is still incredibly complex and difficult though, and you need to be paying attention to everything if you want to get a good experience. A lot of people complain that the game is badly designed and makes no sense, and most of these complaints come from a poor understanding of what the game expects from the player. If you go straight to a guide every time you hit a wall instead of going around, reading tablets, and trying to reason it out yourself will make a lot of the puzzles seem arbitrary and nonsensical, but only because the lack of effort you've put in has robbed you of the context to understand why what you had to do made sense. If you run around without paying attention to the ruins, you'll miss of a lot of the game's more subtle hints and you'll think the game is badly designed, when in fact everything you need to solve every puzzle in the game is there and waiting for you to notice it.\n\nAll that said, there are still some quirks to the game that you have to learn and get used to. The store page has a very helpful guide to getting started that covers what you should do in the overworld level before you even set foot in the ruins, and at least leafing through the instruction manual is a must. Once you clear the first area of the ruins, you should have a pretty complete image of what the game expects from you.","January 23, 2014","true","41.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It leaves out things we take for granted, like leaping on to ladders, now you have to start form the bottom and can't leap off adding a nice bit of tension to many situations. The puzzles so far are reasonable, although the game throws you in and doesn't explain a thing so sometimes it leaves you wondering if there's something you can do or if you're just running around the map swinging your whip like an idiot.

There are many puzzles in the ruins of La-Mulana, and you'll get a real sense of what it's like being Indiana Jones dealing with some of the more obscure ones. Much like a Metroidvania game, you'll end up running into areas which you can only access once you've acquired certain abilities or items. However, this game is a lot harder than your usual Metroidvania, and can sometimes feel poorly designed. For example, I had to actually restart my game from the beginning twice because I missed a couple of very important items early on and ended up unable to exit (partially due to my tendancy to have 1 save file for 1 playthrough).

In this remake of the original freeware game from 2005 La-Mulana you play as Professor Lemeza Kousgi who sets off on an adventure to explore the fabled ruins of La-Mulana. Be warned though: this game is tricky. Even the best players might find themselves referencing guides on occasion. It's no small wonder why people call it the “Dark Souls” of 2D platformers.\n\nIn true Metroidvania fashion you collect collect mystical objects from throughout the ruins. These can be anything from new weapons to new abilities to something that just makes it a little easier to survive. With every treasure you collect you feel yourself grow a little stronger, and it's a great feeling to behold. Conquering challenges you never thought possible and scaling to new heights and exploring new areas feels great. Did I mention the music? A++ music... in fact even if you're not getting the game I suggest you go to a website called “Bandcamp” right now and look up “La-Mulana”. You won't be disappointed, trust me.\n\nThere are some complaints I had about the game though. Sometimes the puzzles and platforming sections just feel “Cheap”. Like the answer to a puzzle was so obscure you HAD to look up the answer to get past. Or you HAD to die on that trap at least once (or be able to see the future) to avoid it. The controls are stiff as well... but reasonable, and once you learn what you can and can not do Lemeza becomes a lot easier to control.\n\nOverall I would say this game is a must have for anyone looking for a challenge or any fans of metroidvanias. The puzzles are hard, the platforming is brutal, the bosses are relentless, and the adventure is fun from beginning to end... and it was worth every second and every penny paid.","June 20, 2014","true","57.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This explanation of the game genre, written by NIGORO themselves, is the best description of the game there is. It is an exploration 2D platformer game, sure. Sometimes games like this are categorized under a name Metroidvania, which is, even in name itself, very inconsistent and hardly descriptive. But whatever your expectations from La-Mulana might be under the assumption, that	 it is" Metroidvania" - they're most likely wrong. It is about exploration. It has platforming. But it's neither about platforming and fluid controls like Metroid, nor it is about combat/RPG elements Castlevania: SotN style. No. It's about ruins exploration archaeology, Indiana Jones style.\nOne of your most used items is a looking glass. One of the most useful apps for your in-game laptop are used to decipher text and save it. You will need that.\nControls are restrictive, but by design, as in a good survival horror game. Enemies and traps are deadly and require planned approach, like you would expect from Demon's/Dark Souls game. But there are always small hints for those, attentive enough, always solutions for those clever enough. There are walkthroughs for everyone else -_-.\nLa-Mulana, the commercial release, is an example of what 2D games can be, an of how far a three-person indie team can go, an of how to make a commercial version of a free game. This game is not for everyone, just like all the best games are.","May 20, 2013","true","32.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This remake retaines all of the 'real' difficulty present while cutting out the fake difficulty, and makes it feel more like a Super NES game than a MSX game.   The controls are remappable and are responsive, althought the jump physics take time to get used to, being Mega Man Physics for standing jumps and being more like Castlevania I-III for moving jumps.  The game's puzzles are fun, but tricky and some can be failed for the remainder of that run so be very careful and do not rush.\n\nI have to give this game a positive review.

As Archaeologist/Ninja extraordinaire Lemeza Kosugi, it's up to you to unearth the secrets of the fabled La-Mulana ruins and best the traps and horrors within! Boasting an updated artstyle and a remastered soundtrack, you'll be hard-pressed to find a game more challenging and satisfying than this (and this is coming from an avid Dark Souls fan). Exploring in true Metroidvania style, the player collects items and abilities that allow him to progress through the ruins all while fighting increasingly-difficult foes and reaping even better rewards. The game itself is meant to feel classical in nature; jump mechanics are reminiscent of Castlevania and the game itself is a love letter to Japan's MSX system. The main selling point of La-Mulana is the puzzling gameplay which acts as a double-edged sword in practice. Half the time you'll want to grab a guide to save you frustration (and you will get frustrated), but when you solve a puzzle by yourself the satisfaction is worth it. That being said, La-Mulana isn't a game you can pick up in a day. It's a game about writing notes, paying attention to subtext, and ultimately thinking outside the box. Some of the puzzles are kinda contrived, but when you know what you're doing the game is fantastic. If you like solving puzzles, collecting powerful artifacts and crazy boss battles, pick it up and give it a try! If you gotta use a guide, no worries.

As Archaeologist/Ninja extraordinaire Lemeza Kosugi, it's up to you to unearth the secrets of the fabled La-Mulana ruins and best the traps and horrors within! Boasting an updated artstyle and a remastered soundtrack, you'll be hard-pressed to find a game more challenging and satisfying than this (and this is coming from an avid Dark Souls fan). Exploring in true Metroidvania style, the player collects items and abilities that allow him to progress through the ruins all while fighting increasingly-difficult foes and reaping even better rewards. The game itself is meant to feel classical in nature; jump mechanics are reminiscent of Castlevania and the game itself is a love letter to Japan's MSX system. The main selling point of La-Mulana is the puzzling gameplay which acts as a double-edged sword in practice. Half the time you'll want to grab a guide to save you frustration (and you will get frustrated), but when you solve a puzzle by yourself the satisfaction is worth it. That being said, La-Mulana isn't a game you can pick up in a day. It's a game about writing notes, paying attention to subtext, and ultimately thinking outside the box. Some of the puzzles are kinda contrived, but when you know what you're doing the game is fantastic. If you like solving puzzles, collecting powerful artifacts and crazy boss battles, pick it up and give it a try! If you gotta use a guide, no worries.

It seems it was developed more in mind for people who appreciated the classic style of platformers where the game doesn't hold your hand and tell you exactly what to do in lame man's terms. Story is great if you pay attention and read whats around in the game and put the pieces together.\n\nFor starters, the music is top notch amazing. Each zone has its own tempo that really blends well in the scene or time in the game. Gloomy places have that mellow tempo while the starting zone has a very upbeat tone going. Same goes with the end game zones with their more climatic tones or feeling of eminent death. The whole game is a giant puzzle platformer where you go to and fro trying to solve puzzles reading tablets spread troughout the ruins while reading these also in turn explain the story. The game takes no time in tutorials or anything, it trows you straight into the game and its up to you to deduct where to go and what to do. Skipping clues or not reading what is in the background items or remembering what was said earlier will have you running around forever and I love this factor. Makes you pay attention and get into it. Traps everywhere, death around every corner and a puzzle just waiting to be solved or a boss to be figured out. Nothing is easy and thats how a game should be.\n\nIts also a great game to speedrun.

Its a metroidvania style world so there are many zones that interlink and many ways to get around doing something in them.\n\nIf its your first time playing it and you have no idea what your doing, this game can easily run you a good 20-40 hours of gameplay while if you want to speedrun you can also blaze trough in under 4 hours. Many ways to play it and well thought out on how to have the player engaged whether its your first or 5th playtrough.

It is the sum of its own opaque clues -- a game made for those who long to understand the elusive other side. It's a game bent on challenge and haziness, built to reinforce hardship, pain, and the thrill of discovery.\n\nLike any game, La Mulana revels in the personality of its own particular design, but in this case, the design is perseverance -- that aforementioned discovery -- and it's vital.\n\nGamers are archeologists, digging through the sands of new worlds, puzzling through unfamiliar rules, manipulating limited systems until they become as second-nature as breathing.\n\nWe play games to discover, and in that sense La Mulana is the universal game -- that misty middle ground between revelation and death, the careful dialogue between frustration and awe.\n\nIn short: it's the ♥♥♥♥ing best, and you should play it, even if only to find that you hate it.\n\nBut hopefully you won't.","January 27, 2014","true","46.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This remake retaines all of the 'real' difficulty present while cutting out the fake difficulty, and makes it feel more like a Super NES game than a MSX game.   The controls are remappable and are responsive, althought the jump physics take time to get used to, being Mega Man Physics for standing jumps and being more like Castlevania I-III for moving jumps.  The game's puzzles are fun, but tricky and some can be failed for the remainder of that run so be very careful and do not rush.\n\nI have to give this game a positive review.

This version is the updated gfx version that was released on wiiware. Play as a professor has he goes on an archaeological exploration of the ruins of La-Mulana. The difficulty curve of this game is extremely high but through trial and error and exploration you will be able to finish each of the dungeons and find treasures in La-Mulana. Each of the hints given from the stones and skulls are semi-cryptic and at first you won't know what they mean but as you play through further and further you'll begin to understand what they mean or how to solve the puzzles. Be careful while exploring as there are a lot of traps that will kill you instantaneously.\n\nDefinitely not meant for people who aren't a fan of memory trial and error challenges (IWBTG), castle/dungeon style non-linear exploration (Metroid, Castlevania). Also I wouldn't resort to a FAQ as it will take away alot of the fun and point of the game. However I will recommend watching the 2nd video in the trailer as it will explain the controls and get you started, since otherwise you'll get placed into the game with no real knowledge on what to do.","September 17, 2013","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This version is the updated gfx version that was released on wiiware. Play as a professor has he goes on an archaeological exploration of the ruins of La-Mulana. The difficulty curve of this game is extremely high but through trial and error and exploration you will be able to finish each of the dungeons and find treasures in La-Mulana. Each of the hints given from the stones and skulls are semi-cryptic and at first you won't know what they mean but as you play through further and further you'll begin to understand what they mean or how to solve the puzzles. Be careful while exploring as there are a lot of traps that will kill you instantaneously.\n\nDefinitely not meant for people who aren't a fan of memory trial and error challenges (IWBTG), castle/dungeon style non-linear exploration (Metroid, Castlevania). Also I wouldn't resort to a FAQ as it will take away alot of the fun and point of the game. However I will recommend watching the 2nd video in the trailer as it will explain the controls and get you started, since otherwise you'll get placed into the game with no real knowledge on what to do.","September 17, 2013","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First of all, you are told that many have challenged the ruins, but none have come out. That is why you need to be cautious and it is possible to be stuck in the game forever without restarting the save file completely.\n\nThis game requires you to live inside it like using Emacs as a browser. This game is never an escape from the stress of the world until you understand yourself better and patiently sympathize with the ruins as a genuine experience.\n\nMy favorite part of the game is Time Attack. It has been declared impossible, but I plan to beat it.\n\nEvery boss has a true strategy (or a few), but some require such deep knowledge that they appear unknowable foes. Perhaps, the same could be said for all of La-MULANA.....\n\nBy the way, the valley in which the game starts out in is based upon Bahrun Valley of Nepal, where it is believed that an immortal race of humans lived. Now, it is uninhabitable, being to high in the mountains to remain in that place for long.\n\nThere are many things to examine in this game which will deepen your appreciation for mythology.

That's wrong. The game gives you the tools and info to solve all of its puzzles. They're still difficult, and I think it's fine and expected for most players to grab a guide at one or two points. But it's absolutely not necessary.\n\nThe actual quality of the puzzles is great. Many of them mesh well with the setting and atmosphere of the game. This sound stupid, but they do that so well that the game genuinely immersed me in the idea of being on an absurd archeological adventure. Just expect to get stuck a little bit sometimes, and expect to take notes (the game has a built-in system for this).\n\nThe action portion of this game is weighty, with jump physics that can punish mistakes pretty harshly, and whip attacks that come out with a delay. The levels and enemies are well-designed around that, and taking out a boss feels real good.","January 26","true","33.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd say that you should definitely give it a try and buy. There are only two major disadvantages to this game that I like but many people seem to not enjoy as much, so if you are involved in one of these groups I would maybe stay away from the game:\n\nIf you don't like castlevania controls (Semi-clunky, slow jumping and attacking) It's how Lamenza controls\n\nand if you don't like intricate riddles and puzzles (we're talking taking out a pad and paper or using your brain extensively to solve one puzzle)\n\nYou might want to stay away. The challenge is hard but rewarding.\n\nThis is one of the best singleplayer games i've played.\n\nAnd finally, a tip:\nScan everything. Seriously, it makes things so much easier.

I'd say that you should definitely give it a try and buy. There are only two major disadvantages to this game that I like but many people seem to not enjoy as much, so if you are involved in one of these groups I would maybe stay away from the game:\n\nIf you don't like castlevania controls (Semi-clunky, slow jumping and attacking) It's how Lamenza controls\n\nand if you don't like intricate riddles and puzzles (we're talking taking out a pad and paper or using your brain extensively to solve one puzzle)\n\nYou might want to stay away. The challenge is hard but rewarding.\n\nThis is one of the best singleplayer games i've played.\n\nAnd finally, a tip:\nScan everything. Seriously, it makes things so much easier.

La-Mulana falls into that rare breed of platforming and exploration that expects you to keep a pen and paper nearby. Pulling a lever you just found makes something rumble in the distance, several skeleton-filled screens away, but it’s up to you to notice what’s changed.\n\nThe game gives precious few clues on how to deal with certain things, like bosses you can’t damage until you have the right item, or fiendish puzzles that punish incorrect solutions with death. It’s the type of game that wants you to draw your own maps, make notes, and have fun exploring the well-crafted universe within. If you don’t ruin it for yourself by looking up guides online, the experience is incredibly rewarding.\n\nThe developer’s own genre for La-Mulana is “Ruins Exploration Archaeological Action Game”, made in homage to old MSX games like Maze of Galious (1987). It’s just you, your trusty whip, and whatever wit you bring, versus a sprawling interconnected tomb full of mystery. The Steam version is based on the freeware game released a few years back, but remade from the ground up with various gameplay and visual improvements. Proper gamepad support has been added, along with achievements, a new area, and additional modes like Time Attack.","September 22, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Since I've been running out of space more and more, I'll just keep it on my Backloggery page.\n\nGameplay: Ah, La-Mulana. A game that I often wonder where it would be today if it weren't for the helpful proliferation of the original by a certain DeceasedCrab. This game can be described in short as a very open-ended Metroidvania-esque game, although that description certainly sells this game short. The ruins of La-Mulana are gargantuan and certainly give a considerable impression that prior civilizations did in fact live here.\n\nThere's three major aspects to this game: platforming, combat, and puzzles. Platforming is really weird at first, but you definitely get used to the controls. They're not bad controls; they just have a lot of weird quirks, such as not being able to jump off of a ladder and only having a good amount of movement control in air after the apex of the jump. Fortunately, a lot of the rooms in the game are designed around this control scheme, with Hell Temple being a perfect demonstration of just how good the controls and the level design synergize to produce very tight platforming.\n\nCombat is pretty bare-bones at times, but once you start getting more and more weapons, it becomes a lot more enjoyable. There are also plenty of items and software combinations (you've got a computer thet you bring along with you) that change certain attributes of the weapon, such as damage and attack rate. Enemies that don't just walk along a path are surprisingly clever, and even the enemies that patrol a platform are still very fun to fight. There's quite the variety of enemies in the game. Even though there are a few reskins, the reskins typically have enough changes to differentiate themselves from their unskinned counterparts. There's also plenty of minibosses which can be rendered useless by a certain item, but I'd still recommend giving these bosses a couple of shots without that item. Bosses are certainly a lot more interesting here than they were in the original. With the exception of Palenque, there really isn't any boss you can troller-coaster your way through. There's ten bosses in total, counting the one at the end of the Hell Temple, and they're all memorable; especially the final boss. The only boss that I didn't think was that good design-wise was Sakit, but that's mainly because it was just a really boring and tedious boss that took too long.\n\nNow it's time to talk about puzzles. This game has a lot of them. Fortunately, you'll hardly ever have to go into a puzzle completely blind, as there are at least a couple of hints for every puzzle scattered throughout the temple, usually within that particular area. Despite this, I did notice a surprising amount of times where I had an idea for a certain puzzle that didn't work in this game, but would've worked perfectly fine in the original. This may just be me thinking like the Nigoro staff; I dunno. Nine times out of ten, if I ever needed to look up a particular solution to a puzzle, it was because I didn't notice an element in the background, or a more specific case later on, I didn't see that there was a teleportation wall. I'll go over this in more detail in the Graphics section, but that was basically my biggest beef with the puzzle solving. Apart from that, I wish that weights were a multiple use item. It's pretty annoying whenever you have to exit an area and lose your progress just because you didn't buy enough weights.\n\nOverall, there's only one room in the entire game that comes to mind as being terribly designed (the Witch Room in Hell Temple aka the only reason why I haven't beaten Hell Temple). However, for a game as big as La-Mulana, that's an incredible feat. 10/10.\n\nStory: I mentioned earlier that the ruins of La-Mulana felt like actual ruins. This is mainly helped by the fact that nearly every bit of dialogue is written in an "ancient" fashion. The story itself pans out much like the Souls series in that your involvement with the story is as much as you want. On the surface, it's just you exploring a temple and killing God at the end. However, start digging deeper, and the story starts to really come together, with lore from various areas weaving as seamlessly as the areas themselves do physically. The biggest highlight story-wise for me came from when things went down in Eden (you know the bit if you've played the original/are reading this review post-mortem style). The game does give you a lot to think about, and if you wanna get the full scoop, you're gonna have to think like an archaeologist. Just like Lemeza. 10/10.\n\nGraphics: Now, the adverts describe this game as being 16-bit, but I'd have to disagree with that. It actually looks a bit more 32-bit like Symphony of the Night. Whatever you wanna call it, though; it's freaking amazingly done. There is an absolutely absurd amount of detail in the areas; a bit too much for me at times. This is what I was talking about earlier with my issue of not seeing things in the background. Again, this is just me and not a mark against the game, but this seemed like a better place to bring it up. Regarding the technical aspects, it fullscreens to pretty much any resolution your monitor may be. It does have the sidebars, much like the 360 port of SotN and they cany be changed as well, which is always nice. Overall, I can tell that a lot of time went into making the areas look as great as they possibly can, even if the amount of detail can be a little bit overwhelming for me. 5/5.\n\nSound: Holy butts, this soundtrack owns. No, seriously, this soundtrack is absolutely top-notch. I definitely went and got the OST after playing the game. This is the kind of soundtrack that can get stuck in your head very easily, although the songs are so good that you won't mind it a bit. All I can say is go listen to Wonder of the Wonder, Interstice of the Dimension, and Grand History if you need convincing that the soundtrack is top notch. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 10/10/5/5; cumulative score of 10/10. Hey, another perfect score! This game has certainly earned it, though. I just wish I had played it sooner so that I would have been more willing to contribute to the La-Mulana 2 Kickstarter. Oh well; it got it's funding even without me..","July 8, 2014","true","40.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It makes the system of saving and healing NOT completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and it fixes up a few puzzles for the better (in some cases by removing them entirely). But at the same time, the remastered aesthetic completely loses the pure retro charm, bossfights have been buffed to be harder by roughly a factor of eight, and some perfectly good puzzles have somehow been turned entirely inside their own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s alongside some crummy new ones. The game is even MORE long-winded, grating, and obtuse now, and were it not for the few select things so sinfully abhorrent about the original release (grapple claw), I'd otherwise just recommend playing that.\n\nI guess I still like it but I doubt more than ever that I'll manage to finish it.","September 23, 2013","true","10.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I looked past the nigh-impossible-without-a-guide puzzles, and the terrible boss design. I ignored the repetitive nature of the game itself. I even defended it against people that disliked the game. But I've passed the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t "event horizon", and I can safely say this game is a turd. A great soundtrack is wasted on this game.\n\nThe boss fights are my biggest gripe. The enemy hitbox is INSIDE its hurtbox on all occasions, and in a game where contact damage does more damage than actual attacks, you've got a ♥♥♥♥♥ on your development team. How can the player be expected to jump, within pixels of an invisible hurtbox, to attack the bosses weak-point.. when the bosses are CONSTANTLY moving?\n\nThe game will also give you a hint in one dungeon, to be used in another to find a vague clue to another puzzle somewhere else. Before you know it, you're scanning a silhouette of Michael Jackson. [I'm not even kidding.]\n\nThe platforming is satisfying enough, until they introduce an ice level in a game with dedicated jump arcs. What ♥♥♥♥ing idiot came up with that?\n\nOverall, the game is just.. a disappointment. There's so much lore in here that I care about, and I want to finish this thing. But I cannot look past these flaws. This is legitimately a bad game, in its very design. I'm actually saddened writing this. Oh well. Maybe La Mulana 2 isn't made by the same clueless morons that made this one, eh?","February 25, 2014","false","38.5"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

Reminds me a bit of Rick Dangerous with puzzles.

Plus the game mechanics are not 100%, so you have to really put some elbow grease into it to not die that often.\n\nOverall certainly not bad, but unless you search for a serious challenge and have a lot of spare time to try things out, it might be not the MetroVania experience you're looking for.","July 18, 2014","false","11.2"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","0"

I'm somewhat on the fence with this one but I did have a lot more fun than frustration with it which I guess is the deciding factor.\n\nSo the first negative thing to say about it is that the controls are intentionally designed to be rather clunky and, well, bad. Well-programmed bad controls though. Makes platforming harder than it needs to be in the end but there's not too much intensive platforming here so whatever.\nAlso, the game gets way too obscure far too frequently. Not particularly ashamed to admit I used a guide for a good bit. I think the most fun way to play this is to attempt as much on your own as you can and resort to a guide for a bit when patience runs low. Prevents frustration and still lets you experience the game as it's supposed to be played a good bit.\nIt really is pretty fun to run around the ruins exploring, especially since you're basically immortal as soon as you find the holy grail item (aside from instant death traps that are a bit too frequent and, of course, the bosses.) Not all the puzzles are overly obscure leading to a pretty decent feeling of success when a tricky one is solved.\nPresentation-wise the game is top-notch. The graphics look great, especially those backgrounds and bosses. The soundtrack's also lovely, with a few especially good tracks in there. The presentation honestly helps with the exploring; I doubt I'd have had as much patience in the uglier, worse sounding 8-bit version, really.\nThe bosses vary in quality. Most of them lean towards the good with a few of them being pretty darn fun when you learn them... on the other hand, there's Viy, who is among the worst bosses I've ever faced in a 2D setting. Just.... no. Everything about that fight is wroooong. There's also a few other rather poorly designed challenges though they're all optional ones (though generally for helpful items.)\n\nAs a whole... yeah, the game certainly has flaws, but I don't think they're unintentional issues most of the time. La-Mulana knows what it wants to be and does an excellent job at being that, which just means it can be a bit off-putting to the average player.","June 24, 2014","true","58.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Oh, boy, where do I start.\n\nLa-Mulana touts itself as an, 'Archaeological action game,' and it shows. The many trials and riddles will beat you; even those who played the original freeware release may find themselves at a loss. This remake really shines through in graphics, audio, and refined gameplay, allowing the challenge to be based mainly on the gameplay and not the controls or wonky visuals. The PC version also touts a commendable amount of features (widescreen, controller support, filters, screen borders, mod support, cross-distribution save compatability).\n\nThere are flaws, however. The game can get very tough and confusing, and some items can be missed altogether. While not a flaw in itself, it is frustrating enough to cause a player to end up using a guide, which can demean a good portion of the gameplay. The greatest reward is solving a difficult puzzle on your own; having a guide makes the game more painful than it already is.\n\nIf you want a challenge, in both skill and wit, definitely try La-Mulana. It is a solid platformer, improving over every aspect of its original form, that tries its best to beat you down, while giving you more reason to keep going. If you've beaten the original (on your own), you'll definitely enjoy this at full price. If you're skeptical, there is the original version to try out, which cannot do this version justice.","November 30, 2013","true","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","3"

Hell yeah it is.\n\nLa-Mulana is a Metroidvania Platform Adventure game. I consider myself quite the expert at these kinds of games with a lot of 100% completions, speed runs, sequence breaking and so on... and even I must admit that this game is not a simple ride. If you're looking for something that will tingle your adventure senses and keep you entertained for a good 30 hours or so at least,   this game will keep you thoroughly engrossed. The graphics for this game were updated to a more SNES style for the remake, and gives it that special retro charm of that era of games. Once you start exploring the game, you'll learn just how finally crafted all the features and the areas are, but the clues sometimes feel like the live in moon logic. Just... check everything and hit everything. Getting into new areas and trying new things out is the heart of the game, and La-Mulana pulls no punches. As soon as you discover how to get into new areas, the difficulty of the game will jump with it.\n\nThis is is still probably one of my favorite games, and there's a lot to it that adds to the replay factor of the game. Also, the game will run on virtually anything... but have a gamepad handy if you've got one. Oh, and if do beat this game, tell me.","November 28, 2013","true","69.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Oh, boy, where do I start.\n\nLa-Mulana touts itself as an, 'Archaeological action game,' and it shows. The many trials and riddles will beat you; even those who played the original freeware release may find themselves at a loss. This remake really shines through in graphics, audio, and refined gameplay, allowing the challenge to be based mainly on the gameplay and not the controls or wonky visuals. The PC version also touts a commendable amount of features (widescreen, controller support, filters, screen borders, mod support, cross-distribution save compatability).\n\nThere are flaws, however. The game can get very tough and confusing, and some items can be missed altogether. While not a flaw in itself, it is frustrating enough to cause a player to end up using a guide, which can demean a good portion of the gameplay. The greatest reward is solving a difficult puzzle on your own; having a guide makes the game more painful than it already is.\n\nIf you want a challenge, in both skill and wit, definitely try La-Mulana. It is a solid platformer, improving over every aspect of its original form, that tries its best to beat you down, while giving you more reason to keep going. If you've beaten the original (on your own), you'll definitely enjoy this at full price. If you're skeptical, there is the original version to try out, which cannot do this version justice.","November 30, 2013","true","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","3"

The game title sounds spanish too - could be one reason ^^\n\nAnyways, my first impressions when I launched La-Mulana was that the controls are kind of rigid : the jumping is not the greatest but not the worst either. Music gave me a little headache since it's a short loop... but still good - just wished the loop was a little bit longer - the double to be precise... Sounds are ok, some are good ; overall it has a feel proper to itself, which is good.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's pretty rich, meaning there seems to be a lot of stuff to do, to collect, to investigate - you're a guy that probably has Indiana Jones posters in his bedroom and pray to the Lost Ark before sleeping.\n\nI like the graphics, especially the levels - the difference between zones is good and refreshing since they change a lot from one to another. There are yellow-ish pyramids-like levels or ones more inspired by some temples of water, etc. Some mobs can seem strange in appearance, but like the sounds, it gives a style to the game.\n\nThe game is full of surprises : level design and game design make it hard, with low-level puzzles to sort - which is great since it's an action-platformer and I hate it when there's too much puzzling to do... and with the save system you can organize yourself so that you don't have to walk a lot to get back to what you were solving - or trying to solve. Sometimes you get punished for not getting the right jump, or for not killing an enemy while jumping. This can get frustrating but that's part of the game and adds to it. Overall it's a difficult game, but for good reasons.\n\nI'm not far in the game but I feel this won't change, and I like it that way. The only bad thing I have to say is this : when moving from one map to another, the ingame objects (characters etc) stop and the camera slide so that it centers to the map you're moving to... and sometimes, you get hit by an enemy that is too close to the point of arrival on the new map, getting you to move back to the previous map you can from - to me this is not a gamebreaking matter but I would have liked not to see that issue being in.\n\nI would recommend getting in when it's on sale OR full price if you like the genre.\n\nThere are a few great ideas that are in this game when it comes to game designing :) you should discover them by yourself. ;)","December 18, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Very detailed and clorful, but also fitting for each area.  The animations for the sprites, espcecially the bosses, are very detailed and nice.  There is nothing bad looking in this game at all!   It's espeicaly nice to look at Tiamat.\n\nSound:\nThe music is very enjoyable and fun to listen to.  From the first ruin to the final boss's theme, all of it is great!  I even have a few of the songs on my computer for listening now and then!  I would love to have a limited edition soundtrack of this game!\n\nControl:\nHere is where I have problems.  If you think Lemeza will control like every other platforming hero, you are DEAD wrong.  Lemeza is one floaty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!  When you jump through the air, he flies like he has the momentum of a rocket (which makes pixel perfect jumping VERY hard), which is weird because if you just step off places, he falls LITERALLY like a rock!  No control.  Straight down.  Pretty much ever other platforming game has a charter that can move a bit while falling, but not Lemeza.  It's almost like he has dark matter in his pants!  But when he swims, he takes so much button mashing to swim around, and when he is at the top of the water, if he has ANY kind of momentum, he bounces along like a stone skipping a pond!\n\nAlso, don't expect perfect twitch movement, as any flick of the control stick (Yes, thankfully this game has controller support), and he spins to the OPPOSITE direction of where you need him to face!   Then you have the issue of Lemeza getting kicked back VERY hard when damaged and losing control of him until he hits solid ground.  This makes it very difficult in certain areas where there are many enemies and jumps.  There are even times where getting damaged kicks you into a spot where you are stuck in a perpetual fall, thus being unable to move and have to resort to teleporting away to fix it!  Lemeza is literally the WORST platforming hero ever!\n\nGameplay:\nThis is where I HATE the game.  The game's puzzles rely on you just wandering around, trying random crap to solve puzzles SOMEWHERE in the entirty of the ruins!  You will literally solve a puzzle that will unlock a chest or door ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE RUINS!  And many of the answers are so obscure that I ACTUALLY REQUIRED A WALKTHROUGH!  You will have to worry about scanning everything to learn the language, and smacking every wall for secret paths, even in places you'd never even think there would be a wall!  You all have to worry about having certain program combinations to power up weapons or unlock abilties which wouldn't be so bad, IF THE PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS ACTUALLY TOLD YOU!  Instead, they are game descriptions, forcing you to test combos through trail and error.\n\nBut the most annoying is the bosses.  Almost all the bosses have a set pattern to learn before you can win.  A pattern that will kill you.  Over.  And over.  And over.  And gods help you is you screw up as most bosses will give you no quarter.  I have played hard games before, but DAYUM!  Then you have the final boss,..  I died the least to the final boss, who has the most obvious patterns and can even be cheesed with sub weapons!  I kill the boss's final form with the axe and pistol! , making it literally the easiest boss!\n\nSo...  I have this to say.  I will admit this is a well made game, but I HATE it.  This is NIGORO's pride and joy, but I DESPISE it!  If you like difficult and unforgiving platformers, then you will ADORE this game.  But if you're like me and get frustrated easily, AVOID THIS GAME!\n\nThis game will rip your soul out of your body, stomp on it, do digusting, vile, horrible things to it, hang it by it's toe nails, use it as a boxing bag, drop it into a grinder, throw the remnants into a bowl, mix with ghost peppers and wasabi, tossed into an oven with liver, cooked at 500 degrees for 20-40 hours, then pulled out, drowned in horseradish sauce and then shoved up the ♥♥♥♥ of your body, give you the middle finger and runs away with your self respect like it's a cheap ho.\n\nSo, ummm...  that's a no.  It's a well made game.  But..  just.... no.","October 4, 2015","false","37.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

That's all I can really say about the less fun elements of L-M. The game is good by all respects, but some of its "nods" to old school gaming become the direct problems with the game namely its jumping mechanics which feel committed and not flexible in the least. This makes playing the game for long periods an exercise in you character fighting you, again the game is not bad but it will easily deter entry level platforming players.\n\nThis problem does get better as more power ups in the game are located, but some may not be able to stomach the game long enough to get to said power ups. still if you are looking for a platformer that doesn't hand hold you as much and has a learning curve, this game is up your alley, but you've been warned the game does not pull punches especially on hard mode.","September 1, 2013","true","97.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Go the bulk up route. This game does not strictly require you to fight any bosses until you're roughly 90% done the game.

The bosses all have roughly the same difficulty, meaning you can fight them in whatever order you feel like.\n\nAverage at games? Play through the normal way. When you're done an area, fight the boss, and move on. None of the bosses are particularly harder than any others, they just take some getting used to.\n\nGood at games? Set it to hard mode. More enemies, harder enemies, bosses have more health and do more damage. Accidentally went to hard mode, but can't do it? Don't reset.

It's bigger than your Metroidvanias and the puzzles feel like they came from an old point and click, not the "use new item on new obstacle type" bin.  Navigation is difficult without taking notes (which there's a mechanic for) and possibly making your own map.  Most importantly, the environments get incredibly creative towards the second half of the game- there's a lot of fluff about ancient hoohah that all exists in the endgame, and figuring out the connections between it and the ruins you initially explore is really rewarding.\n\nAs a minor consolation, there are a number of items and some optional tricks that can make the game substantially easier as you go on, so it's not all pain and suffering.  60% of the game is more fun than most games of this genre, if you're willing to put up with the swuzz long enough to see it.","December 22, 2013","true","46.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/230700/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Do you remember back in the NES days when games were hard as hell? Making progress from one level to the next was a monumental task. You couldn't just sit down, turn your mind off and breeze through any task; games required you to memorize and adapt. It made even the most awesome of ideas sometimes horrid.\n\nLa-Mulana harkens back to that exact idea. If the game isn't kicking your ♥♥♥, you must be Jesus. While I appreciate a game that doesn't hand hold me, I'm torn on exactly how La-Mulana goes about torturing the player. Sometimes, it can feel really unfair; other times, your objective is clouded in obscurity that nearly necessitates a guide.\n\nThe basic breakdown of the game is akin to Super Metroid or any more recent Castlevania. You explore dungeons on a 2-D plane, acquire weapons that will help in different rooms and proceed to tackle bosses and enemies as they come to you. It's all about exploration, puzzle solving and some tight jumps.\n\nThe difficulty comes from a lot of cheap tactics and some staggering hits from your foes. The developers philosophy was that a normal person placed in a hidden cavern wouldn't have the know how to get out. You normally wouldn't jump down a black hole and expect to land softly.\n\nThat does make sense, realistically, but it kind of hurts the game in some parts. Puzzles end up following their own logic and you often are required to walk through hazards to make any progress. It can lead to you being unsure, backtracking a lot to find some different route and then giving up and just saying, "♥♥♥♥ it!"\n\nIt's cool to see a cavern designed in a way that should facilitate logical thinking, but to hide so many core solutions behind layers of riddles and abstract thought stinks. I just want to be able to evaluate the situation and move on, not have to constantly refer to a guide to figure out what I'm doing.\n\nThe game makes up for this with extremely tight controls and some incredible music and graphics. The artwork comes to life in all it's 32-bit glory. The soundtrack is immediately nostalgic while being modern and energetic. The boss fights are intimidating and demand you to master your skillsets.\n\nIt makes for some climactic and exhilirating encounters, but getting to those points is often frustrating beyond reason. That I somehow managed to finish the game in around 20 hours is a testament to how determined I was, but most players won't have that resolve.\n\nLa-Mulana asks a tremendous amount from you. You are only going to get from it what you put it. Nothing about the game will coddle you until you succeed. If you cannot adapt, you will fail; time and time again.\n\nSo while I think the game is good, I can't recommend it to a lot of people. It's just going to put off more casual players or gamers who like not relying on walkthroughs. If you can muster up the courage for the challenge, it's definitely a worthwhile investment.\n\n7.5/10","November 22, 2015","false","21.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can't control your jump trajectory except at the beginning of your jump, and you can barely control your falling direction.\n\nThen comes the real oldschool part. The puzzles. Where you not only have to think outside the box; but also flip the box upside down, chop it open, and analyze it with a microscope.\n\nThe hints offer only slight indication of what you need to do.\n\nAt first it seems pretty simple. The first puzzle presents you with a hint to kill two red skeletons, you kill the skeletons, which unlocks a block needed to complete a puzzle. Fine.\n\nThen they start getting a bit obtuse. You get a hint that the mouths of two statues are connected, ie. pushing a block in one will push another out the other. Only the perspective doesn't fit the block you are shown, and you have to hit it with your whip.....And there has been no indication that your whip can affect these blocks.\n\nYou get a hint that the geometry of the temple is messed up. Apparently this is supposed to refer a secret passage right behind the hint that leads you to the other side of a map.\n\nSometimes puzzles activate things in adjacent rooms, sometimes they activate things 4 rooms over.\n\nThis is the first level alone.","December 30, 2013","true","40.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pfmpaulo/recommended/230700/","pfmpaulo","pfmpaulo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pfmpaulo/","460 products in account","Let me point out the things that I hated about this game.\n\n-The jumps. You never know for sure where your jumps gonna land, and it's not that I don't enjoy retro SNES castlevania kinda of jump, but this is not like Castlevania IV, it's more like Castlevania 2, Volgarr the Viking did it good.\n\n-The graphics confuses you. The game is meant to be full of secrets and doesn't explain anything to you, and I'm ok with that, I like to explore and figure things out by myself, but the scenery shouldn't be a puzzle itself, if I look at somewhere and I don't know if I can land on it, or if I can even PASS through it, that really turns down all the fun to search for secrets, thjis is in the category of mistakes that you cannot do on your game, that's poor level design straight outta NES era.\n\n-Farm system. Why does it exist in this game? You are exploring, you suddenly finds the solution for the puzzle, but damn, you're out of "weights" and can't solve the puzzle, actually, you can't do anything, because you use weights on the ruins everytime, time to go back to the village to farm or buy some weights, like, why? Why I have to stop and change my mindset in the middle of a run just because I run out of a stupid item? There is no reason to the weights to exist, there is no item management in the way you use them, because you want to use it everytime, there is no strategy.\n\n-The difficulty. No, I'm not a filthy casual, but this game is just hard for the sake of being hard, it is actually a contradiction by itself, because if it wasn't that hard, the exploration and sense of discovery would be much more enjoyable, the game begs to you to explore and find secrets, but you're not going to be able to do that, because even if you're doing good and playing well, sometimes the game's just going to destroy you, imagine that you're on a pit, there is a ladder to get out of this pit, that's the only way out, but when you climb it, an enemy attacks you and drops you back to the pit, you try again and again, but there is no time to either kill it or dodge it, so you're basically trapped. IT IS A DEATH TRAP THAT CAN TAKE 5 MINUTES OR EVEN MORE, JUST TO KILL YOU.\n\n-The puzzles. No, the puzzles are not good, I've seen people praising this game for its puzzles, but no, the idea of puzzles on this game is like, put a bunch of spikes, if the player fall on those spikes he can use a "weight" to finish the puzzle. There are some oks, but most of them can't be even called puzzles.\n\n-Emails/Tutorial. The game keeps pausing itself to teach you some dumb things, like, at the start of the game it says to you use a "weight" to get an item, but it doesn't say anything about the purpose of the item, which would be something interesting. The problem is, it uses texts to teach things that should be teached by visuals, and doesn't do anything to teach you about things that should be explained by texts. Like, if you want to make your water poisoned, just make her visually poisoned, don't send me a damn text about it.\n\n\nThey say that this game is a metroidvania, but it looks more like a roguelike with random dungeons, even if the dungeons are not random, it looks like, it feels like random.\n\nJust do yourself a favor and go buy Spelunky, it does almost everything that this one tries, but with success.","January 5","false","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Its definitely a nostalgia blast of 16 bit graphics. The story is intriguing, a nice approach to the genre. The mezo-american themed art is really enjoyable in the game. Its hard, but this isn't necessarily why I'm rating it poorly. Its WHY the game is hard that is the issue. The play control is just utterly terrible and the collision detection is bad. I can't tell you how many times I've watched my whip sail right through a sprite and inflict no damage. I can't tell you how many times I've jumped from one screen to the next and the trajectory of the jump changes because of the screen change. To make matters worse, it isn't predictable, so I can't even build up muscle memory to improve my precision. It reminds me of the NES days when game devs made games ridiculously difficult to mask the limited amount of content in the game.\n\nUnless you're seriously into spending hours repeating the same action over and over until you get lucky enough to get through an area, I can't recommend this title.","January 9","false","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Two examples from the physics complaint: jump mechanics and preservation of inertia. There are two things that Super Mario Brothers, the gold standard of physics expectations in 2D platformers, do correctly. If I fall off a ledge running full-tilt, where do I fall? Straight down? No, but in La-Mulana, the answer is "yes."\n\nI'm torn between conquering this and deleting it forever, or just deleting it forever and cursing the developers for burning away some of my money.\n\nI would hope they fix the physics in the two aspects--oh! Another one! As a player, I have the expectation of being able to grab a ladder/rope in mid-fall. Here, I cannot. It turns a game that could be "interesting" into one that is "tolerable ... perhaps."\n\nI cannot possibly recommend this game.\n\nUPDATE: I looked at the Kickstarter page for This Game Part Two. I learned more from the manual there than I did about this game in my entire ownership, and I played the demo and found the physics problems remain. I will not be buying that game, and see now that this was an intentional design decision. Pity, as it's irritating and unenjoyable to be stymied by a game with sloppy controls and unintuitive physics and movement. "Hard" is fine; "broken" is irritating.\n\nUPDATE 2: I now have ten hours of gameplay invested. I have only invested these, an additional eight hours over when I wrote my original review, in order to ensure I wasn't selling this game short. I was not. This is a game that I "tolerate," at best. I do not enjoy it. The controls and art and design all conspire to push the player into prime striking position for enemies, and there is little logical association between a switch and its effect. I have to wonder if the dev put this out there as a lark: a kind of special f-bomb to video game players everywhere: "you like to play games? Well f-you, guys!" This is the only explanation that makes sense with all the design and artistic conventions that have been broken in this game. I really, really, really wish I hadn't waited six months between purchase and play, because now I'm screwed out of $15. Worse, the person who wrote this software is now some percentage of that $15 richer, AND has been given a dollar-vote of, "yes, this game is good." It is not. It needs significant work. It won't get that work, though, as La-Mulana 2 is on Kickstarter and is more of the same; just a re-skin of this game with (presumably) different and equally-f-you-based "puzzles."\n\nUPDATE 3: The game is growing on me, like a fungus. After 33 hours total gameplay and a 6-hour (new) savefile, it's interesting, but continues to be hamstrung by horrible platformer-controls and swimming mechanics. If you fall into lava with fireballs/rocks, you're pretty much done for, as you'll be batted around like a toy mouse in a room full of cats. Ice is similarly slick, but that's expected: it's ice, just ice where mu = 0.0001 or so. You will, in one particular area, be sent back and forth between screens if you forget that an enemy awaits just inside the screen transition, on ice.\n\nOverall, with 33 hours in and really needing--truly, absolutely needing--a direct walkthrough read in the Chamber of Illusions (the whole "on bended knee" thing. Ugh!), I remain correct in my original assertion: I cannot recommend this game at its asking price given its treatment of the above controls/scenarios. Could I recommend it at the $5 mark? Yes. It's frustrating, as it is hamstrung by deliberately-bad controls, but for $5 you can do much worse.\n\nUPDATE 4, 46 hours of play: I would recommend this game at the $5 mark. Comments on controls and physics are unchanged, but the game as a whole has grown on me. Gameplay improved post-Feather.","December 15, 2015","false","48.6"," 27 of 56 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","27","56","3","1"

Clever? no, cheap, really cheap.\nThe controls themselves are so cryptic that even after reading the button configuration I couldn't figure out how to do something simple like reading signs and it took me a while to learn how to open treasure chests.\nthe player's movement have a delay, which as many other features is a reference to castlevania, however, where castlevania's delay had a reason to exist, a justification for it, this game doesn't so i can only assume the main character is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or something.\ncontrary to what other reviewers said, you can change your direction in a jump, but only when you jump straight up, and only when you reach the top of the jump. which quickly becomes annoying to do when climbing something.\nthe enemies are cheap, they mostly move faster than you and have patterns designed to get you without being hit.\nwhen you are hit the character jumps back a huge distance, it's worst than castlevania X's!\n\nI was frustrated to the point of almost giving up before even entering the La-Mulana ruins from the title, which is close to where you start ( about 2 or 3 screens away ).\n\n\nthe music is ok, it's repetitive and tries to be epic, but it gets tiring after a while, at least it changes within different areas\nthe graphics are nice, they try to be SNESish but in reality they are more like GBA games, they have a obvious strong influence from final fantasy 6 and the castlevania gba games.\n\nI've seen sites like tiny cartridge drooll all over this game because of how it is a throwback to older games and stuff, but honestly even in the 90s I wouldn't play this with much better games around. it feels like one of those experimental early playstation 1 games, in a bad way.\n\nthis game has potential to be good, hell, it has potential to be awesome, but it's so focused in making you have a miserable experience that it's not even fun, it's definitely difficult yeah, but not fun in any way, in the end it feels like a chore, a really really annoying chore.\n\n( and I'm purposely avoiding saying things like "oh this game is for masochists" "oh this game is so hard and wants to make you suffer" because I don't want people to be encouraged to buy it and challenge themselves, it's not worth it. )\n\ngo buy Rogue Legacy, it's a similar idea but done right.","December 26, 2013","false","2.8"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","0"

On top of that there's a few control choices that feel unintuitive.  The slabs where you save you have to press down to activate the save screen, but there's no indication that these are save points or even how to activate it.  I found out how to use it by accident.  A simple indicator on the screen is all that was needed here.\n\nThe graphics are confusing.  I had a hard time telling at times what was a platform I could jump on or if it was just background.  Considering that the game has walls you can walk through anyway you'll have to try everything by trial and error.\n\nThere is not much for PC specific options here but even the most basic PC games have resolution options.  If you increase the resolution in this game it doesn't increase the resolution of the game, but instead creates a border around the game.  You can customize the border I guess... woo...\n\nIf you want a game similar to Castlevania 2 for better or worse, then you'll probably like this game.  There might be a rewarding experience somewhere in this game but I haven't found it yet.  There are other games on Steam like A.R.E.S. that pull off Metroidvania better and I would recommend one of those games instead.\n\nTL;DR version:  Avoid unless you really enjoy Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest","December 22, 2013","false","0.5"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

Trapdoors into spike (spike cause a lot of damage) and lava, pits with pop up spikes that you can't jump out of, enemies placed at the edge of screens causing you to walk into them when you transition to that screen, ridiculous puzzles you absolutely need a guide to figure out and death traps. These add only unnecessary frustration and don't belong in the game.\n\nIn the list above I mentioned ridiculous, most puzzles are not ridiculous but later in the game many puzzles get ridiculous but by the second half of the game the get ridiculous. There is one puzzle that requires you to go to a specific pot in an aria you hadn't needed to go in a long while and Mario down it. Another example is getting the grail, you'll need the grail, it is the games form of fast travel but to get the grail you need to walk through a false wall with no indication that it is a false wall. The game does give hints in the form tablets spread around the game and give you a way to save the text from the tablets but you don't know always which tablets have information you need and they are often not near where the puzzle's they are giving hints for are.\n\nThe game is inconsistent when  it come to controlling the player character (named Lemeza) in the air in the air. If you jump at an angle you have some control, it's not Meat Super Boy level of control but it doesn't need to be,  if Lemeza jumps strait, up you don't have control until Lemeza reaches the pick of the jump and starts falling, then you gain some control during his decent, but if Lemeza walks off a ledge and falls you have no control until Lemeza hits the ground. This may seem minor to some but it causes a lot of problems in many parts of the game. As I've said the game doesn't need Meat Boy level of control but consistent control would have been a lot better.\n\nThirdly is the music. The music is good but it eventually becomes highly irritation. After hearing the music for many hours it becomes grating. Again the music isn't bad and if the music is available for purchase I would recommend buying it but it's like a song that out stays its welcome and it's only like that because of how many hours I've played the game.\n\nOver all it is a good but very flawed games. I've put about 60 hours into it and I can't argue against that so I recommend it but I suggest you don't play past the middle of the game.","December 31, 2013","true","66.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game is not difficult, it's senseless.\n\nIn the begining you will find how to progress with clues and doing some exploration, but after a few minutes you won't have a clue, your exploring abilities won't be enough and here comes the worst... you will find your way using a FAQ (truly, there won't be other way). Exploring might be ok if you were rewarded for the time you spend walking and killing, but you won't, moreover you will be wasting items (wich won't be easy to get) and you will be seriously punished for exploring (this will lead to backtracking and LOTS of trial and error). So, it's a contradiction to design a game that forces you to explore and at the end it punish you for that.\n\nI bought this game with great expectations but i'm very VERY dissapointed.\nI think the idea is great but the implementation is awful...\n\nSeriously... don't get this game unless you are extremely (and i mean EXTREMELY) patient, commited AND LUCKY otherwise get something else.","June 16, 2015","false","19.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Check the "global achievement stats" and see for yourself.\n\nI urge caution in buying this. Some people like it; I like it. But many don't understand what they're buying. The game is "hard" -- but not only "hard". It's deeply flawed:\nThe first few hours are awful.\nSome puzzles are tedious and the solutions random.\nSome puzzles expect you to draw and annotate maps.\nYou will need to go out-of-game to get help on puzzles; no one lucks onto the solution of every puzzle. Bear in mind that going out-of-game means seeing spoilers, and meta-gaming like "Does it 'feel like cheating' to look up X after putting in Y effort?" It fundamentally changes the experience.Some of us like the game anyway, because of the quality of art and music, sense of exploration, replay value in speedruns, etc. We like it in spite of its flaws; you may not.\n\nHere's what you can try. There's a free La-Mulana 2 demo available on Kickstarter. Since it's an early demo, it uses the same engine as La-Mulana, and is highly similar: the same jump, the same whip, the same style of puzzles. It's also a better newbie experience; it introduces important mechanics sooner, and more clearly. Try it first. Will you end up drawing your own map, and will you enjoy it? Or googling maps and answers, and will you enjoy that? Try it and decide.\n\nI hope you make an informed decision, the decision best for you. It's not just "other people" who don't enjoy this game.

With a lot of backtracking and "powerup" items and skills, La-Mulana has all the trappings of metroidvania, with a massive game area and lots of interesting bosses. Only problem is that it mistakes challenging with frustrating = fun. Overly cryptic puzzles, stale humour and 90's era controls leads to a lot of frustrations and deaths. Weird jump mechanic, can't grab a ladder in the air, can't drop down a ladder, strange hit-boxes and strange weapon animations meant trying to solve the already difficult puzzles too much to bear. And perhaps the fact it's a remake from an era long past that makes me not like this game.

Yet controls are working to slow. The movement of a character is limited. The goons are respawning each time you go to the next screen. Oh and when you get to the edge of the screen it moves to the next one - should be done as a smooth move during movement of a character. You cannot jump of the ladder, sometimes because of the silly controls you just fell over and over. I tried the game 4 times and passed.

On top of that, this is part of a genre I really love and don't see very many games of this type. The only recent one I can think of is Dust: An Elysian Tail. La-Mulana perfectly replicates the experience of exploring a treasure filled booby trapped temple. And there in lies the overall problem with the game.\n\nFirst off, controls in this are very floaty at best, while movement and attacking is fine, if you jump you are committed to it up until a certain point in the air, which leads to some very tricky and downright frustrating moments of platforming. Adding to that, if you are hit by something and the area requires lots of jumping, you will be sent flying and can only recover movement upon landing on the ground ala: old school Castlevania. When a lot of exploration in this game relies upon pixel perfect platforming, getting hit not only hinders advancement, but also can be unavoidable at times. This can be especially bad when you are fighting big bosses that sometimes take up the entire screen and force you to move from platform to platform, or clumsily jump around in hopes of dodging that one fireball while at low health.\n\nPuzzles in this game are what really drives in the decision to purchase this or not, as they can be downright unforgivable and just don't teach you how they effect the rest of the game. Two switches, one could be a trap that leaves you with the only choice to restart your game, one just activates another puzzle in a distant room, oh and if you don't get a certain item... you're ♥♥♥♥ed! Want to know what this item is? We ain't going to tell ya, you just have to solve more puzzles to find it... if you're lucky! If you're not lucky, the only choice you have is to use the RESET feature in the settings. You will use this often as the game just loves to trap you without any prior warning. And to top that all off, you had better save often because these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments will occur often, and sometimes at a time where hours of progress will be lost!\n\nTeaching the player about the game over time is especially important to this genre, trial and error gameplay only serve to punish those who do not know better or are just starting out, and having a reset the game function is not the right way to fix such an inherently flawed puzzle system. Throughout all of the game I was lost, unable to solve the basic of puzzles, and would find myself trapped for making a beginner's mistake. The game barely teaches you it's basics unless you go out of your way to purchase necessary equipment that is needed to beat the game.\n\nA good exploration game requires the tightest of controls, intelegent/clever puzzles, and the right conveyance to teach players as they play so that they can grow smarter and stronger. A bad one puts you into impossible situations where you cannot win and says "Oh well, start over from the beginning and do it right this time!". I found this frustrating on my first 12 hours, I'm sure it would be better on a second playthrough, but I strongly believe first impressions are the most important thing when it comes to a game, and I cannot recommend this game as there are better alternatives out there.\n\nPlay Dust: An Elysian Tail, Castlevania: SotN, and/or Super Metroid instead. Just pass on La-Mulana.","January 4, 2014","false","11.6"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

That being said (and admittedly I probably am not the target audience for this game), the 'puzzles' at the end aren't so much difficult as being completely off in left field.  After the first half, I was pretty much playing via the walkthrough--which is unfortunate, because I know I could have figured some of the  things out on my own.

Sometimes you have to walk through an invisible wall, sometimes you have to set a rotating stone then figure out what it changed in who knows what room.\n\nI am sure there are some people who will really like this style of game. To everyone who says this is like Demon/Dark Souls, you are completely wrong (It is more like The Battle of Olympus for NES). Just because if you die you start over from a save spot does not mean it is like those games. You can save anytime you want with this and you keep all your stuff. I wouldn't even call this game difficult because it is pretty easy jumping over traps and whipping bad guys. It just takes a ridiculous amount of time to figure out what everything does and for me, that is not fun.\n\nThe music is very good and I thought the controls were decent (using an xbox controller).\n\nOverall though, this was a terrible gaming experience and as much as I hate leaving games unfinished, this just isn't worth the time. It is not fun for me to have to look at a guide to figure out what I am missing every 15 minutes. 5/10.","January 25, 2014","false","3.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

There are many "kaizo-traps", essentially traps where your only escape is death/game-overing, and that's just no good. I'm not sure if there's a way to heal other than gathering....uh, exp and leveling up? If that's leveling up, nothing seems to change when you get a full bar of green exp, you just heal. Again, may just be me and I may be missing something.\nBut what I'm not missing is being sucker-punched by every effort to explore around. So, if you want a game that likes to make you suffer, don't get this, there's countless other masochistic games on the web for free, such as "I want to be the guy: The Movie: The Game Beta". And if you just want a challenging platformer, there's "You have to win the game" on steam for FREE, and if you MUST pay, I can suggest VVVVVV because it's got some interesting quirks to it. But not this.

I really want to like this game but I cannot. The game contains elements that should have died back in the SNES era.\nEnemies respawn once you leave a room.\nJump controls do not feel natural.\nWalking off of a ledge locks you into a vertical fall, which is frustrating.\n\nYou will rarely feel like you are making actual progress because every other room will need an item from somewhere else or require you to solve a puzzle somewhere far away. There is never any clear or intuitive route for progression. Even with maps and walkthroughs open I have a great deal of difficulty figuring out where I am going or how to progress.\n\nHints are often useless because they will not be found with the puzzles they correspond to, or will be far too cryptic. There is no way to record hints either, so you will likely forget them long before they become relavent. Some puzzles are so unintuitive that they cannot be solved on your own, such as one puzzle where you must first collect an item from somewhere far away from the puzzle, bring it to the correct room, pause the game and then wait five minutes.\n\nTraps in the game are often unpredictable and when they aren't killing you out of nowhere they are frustrating you by setting you back several rooms. Many times you will be struck by lightning because you hit a wall that did not look special at all, or a floor will drop from under you and set you back another 5 minutes.\n\nOverall, while I do want to like this game, La-Mulana is filled with so many constant annoyances that it is hard to feel like you are having fun. Having to constantly backtrack around the game while dealing with annoying enemies and traps while constantly being blocked by puzzles is too frustrating for me.","May 19","false","17.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

But after I spent some more time with it (time counter isn't wholly accurate, spent a good deal of time playing on a friend's account), that view has changed a good deal.  This game... can be fun.  Its got some cool Indiana Jones-esque elements, good puzzles, and interesting enviroments and boss design.  That's all well and good.  But... the game bills itself as challenging.  I don't agree.  Its hard.  Not Dark Souls hard; not challenging in a way that drives you to want to win, to want to beat the next boss and the next and eventually the game.  Its frustratingly hard.  Unfun hard.  This becomes ESPECIALLY apparent in alot of the boss fights.  First of all, give the arenas a little bit of thought!  The second boss' arena is two platfroms and a ladder.  The first?  A series of floating platforms placed above of each other.  The third?  A minecart run over tracks of varying heights against a boss who you can only damage by hitting his head.  First three bosses weak points are all the head.  Also, this game, particularly in the boss fights, has some of the worst hitboxes I have seen in a videogame.  We're talking Dark Souls 2 bad.\n\nThe game itself doesn't even know what its doing half the time.  For example, sometimes the fireballs on the third boss will do 8 damage, other times 12?  Sometimes you'll get hit by his charge, other times the exact same thing wil happen, the exact same attack, the exact same point of contact between the PC and the boss, and nothing will happen.\n\nAlso noob traps.  SO MANY NOOB TRAPS.\n\nDoesn't rate a buy, and CERTAINLY not at $15.00.","July 9, 2014","false","5.4"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","1"

Here's an actual review:\n\nThis is going to sound really bad, but...\nIt's too hard.\nIt's a throwback to the nes days where you weren't given a manual most of the time because people threw the boxes to their games away, and even if you got a manual it wasn't very useful for most games.\n\nThis game is linear with a mostly set path, but you are given very little aid in finding it.  This game can be beaten very fast if you go through a what-to-do checklist from a site like gamefaqs, but people say that this is a terrible idea as it ruins the fun of the game.\n\nThat's right, most people will tell you that the fun of this game, which is a side-scrolling platformer, does not come from gameplay mechanics and interesting fights, but instead from working against the attrition you suffer while trying to find where to go.  The gameplay is fairly solid, but even the most seasoned player will take damage as they work through figuring out what to do.  This would be fine if the game didn't have two very unnecessary punishment elements to it:\n\nHealing is difficult.\nWhen you die, you die.  Progress lost.\n\nAs I stated earlier, this is a throwback to the NES era of games, but I don't think it's a good thing.  The 80's were 30 years ago; We've advanced in technology.  A game doesn't need to be extended by punishing mechanics anymore.  Not many people have the time to just say "oh, I died into a dungeon I couldn't survive because I wasn't supposed to come here yet.  I didn't need that 30 minutes anyways."  Punishing exploration is a good way to dissuade people from wanting to explore.\n\nThink about whether you think a game should be punishing at all anyways.  Does it make it more fun?  Is it fun to get so angry that you want to snap your controller in half because you just lost an hour because of some spikes or from falling into a pit of water?\n\nSomewhere in La Mulana there is a good game with great mechanics and an interesting environment/story to explore.  I just don't like that it's buried beneath a bunch of design decsions that make the game hard for the sake of being hard.","January 21, 2014","false","2.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

The game is too hard, elusive, and the physics are sub-par.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nWhen jumping, you are constricted from free movement till the apex of the jump, making it partially more realistic but still not physically accurate. Why not just have it be the old-fashioned method as seen in SNES Mario games where you can move freely in the jump? Also, when you are hit, you are stunned - you fall stories from a ladder, to land at the bottom. You can not course-correct if you've been hit off an edge or a ladder. This means if there's an enemy guarding the ladder, it's a frustrating and idiotic obstacle. And you cannot jump onto a ladder, or drop from a ladder to save time.\n\nAlso, where you are supposed to in the game, what exactly an item does, etc., is too subtle. Some of the humor is cute, some of it detracts from the immersive world. It is too easy to die between saves, so I will have to get into the habit if playing more carefully and saving at save stations often. No quicksive in the game, as far as I can see.\n\nAUDIO\nThe music is nice, but lacks in bass and is too repetitive. Why not something more like the gems of music in Final Fantasy 6?\n\nGRAPHICS\nAnd one final issue: the game seems to be of the old, pixelated fashion. SNES was not designed this way for kicks, but for limiations. They did a great job on the graphics back in the day, and it worked for common TV screens. These days, we have large resolution screens with games of high potential, like La-Mulana, which fall short not only in stilted gameplay but with limited, 8-bit graphic stylization. If most gamers have a large resolution screen in 2013, the sprites should be created at a high, standard resolution (think 1920x1200,) and then downscaled to a measely 800x600, which is the standard this PC game is designed at.\n\nLovely game, high potential, but the controls do not give you that fluid upper-hand you'd expect for a challenging retro game. Give us proper physics, and you'll have a much better game.","December 22, 2013","false","2.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

The point of a remake is so that you can run the game on newer computers, not so you can play the same game, but with irksome changes here and there.  The difficulty curve is all messed up because they changed too much.  Not to mention, at least for me, the Remake runs WORSE than the original does.  I'm aware that if you've never played the original, then the differences won't be as offputting.  Although, I do believe you should just play the original anyway.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's still a "good" game.

Even after almost 6 hours I've only found and defeated one boss, but I rarely feel like I'm wandering around aimlessly. I feel like I'm gathering clues to solve a huge puzzle...and most of the time that's exactly what I'm doing. Every time I backtrack I find something new, or decipher a cryptic note I didn't understand the last time. It's like a tougher and more puzzle-oriented Super Metroid with some I Wanna Be The Guy-style traps. Hints come in the form of emails from the village elder as well, but they're not too revealing, just a little nudge to help you get going. Expect to be writing some things down on your journey.\n\nMy only complaint is the controls, which I suppose are supposed to be realistic, but even after 6 hours I'm still not used to them. When you jump you're committed to it; forward jumping has a set arc depending on how high you jump that can't be interrupted, and jumping straight up is uncontrollable until you reach the height of the jump. Falling off a ledge forces you to plummet straight down. It's somewhat irritating at times, but it's tolerable.","July 6, 2014","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The bosses are all unique and most will surprise you (most bosses have changed completely from the original game). La-Mulana probably has the most consistently great soundtrack of any game I have played.\n\nI tried to stay clean and beat it on my own, but like many others, looking through loads of screenshots to figure what to do became tiresome after around 70% of progress. I am pretty patient when it comes to games, but I do not regret looking up how to solve some of the last puzzles, I never would have figured them out. It's not for everyone. Other than the difficulty of some of the later puzzles, some things like the jumping physics, and instant death traps (which aren't really a big deal - even if you forget to save often there is a frequent auto-save feature at certain points) may turn some players away. The way the player jumps was intentional and the platforming in the game was designed around it, so it rarely bothered me. I actually found it pretty fun to figure out the little nuances of the jump, and it just felt like part of the challenge to me.\n\nEven though I was finding myself at a loss near the end, I kept going because I felt like I had to complete this game. It's one of those games (like Metroid) where if you stop playing for a while, it will take you ages to remember what you were even doing and what you have access to. Also it's damn good. I think it's well worth the price, it's much deeper and more polished than I expected. At least now I can finally delete all those tablet screenshots.","July 6, 2014","true","108.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The standard enemies are not a terrible threat, but they'll wear you down over time if you're not careful.  The bosses are quite challenging, require practice to beat, but many of them can be made easier by outscaling them with power-ups.\n\nThe puzzles though... Oh god... Mercy... I thought I was doing pretty well at first, but after getting about a third of the way into the game, I was stuck.  This game is full of "moon logic" puzzles.  Even if you are very meticulous in taking notes, you'll likely need to refer to a guide to get through much of the game.  These aren't optional puzzles either, they're REQUIRED to complete the game.  You could wander for hours, whipping walls and trying things and still not find out where you need to go next.

And if you don't feel the game itself was hard enough, you can turn on hard mode via a tablet or even take on the daunting challenge of Hell Temple.","June 28, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It gives you clues on how to progress and vague goals. I've got a little notebook by my computer, and it's been fun to write down the clues I get and writing notes, it feels like actual exploration in a way I've never seen in a game before.\n\nBut, uh.\n\nRemember that part in Super Metroid where you get the power bomb and wander around for a couple hours trying to figure out what to do wih it? And then you finally manage to blow up the glass tube that gets you in Maridia, and you think to yourself, "How on earth was I supposed to know to do that?"\n\nYeah. Welcome to that, the videogame. The middle to end of this game is effectively that, repeatedly, for a number of hours. Rather than difficulty, the game goes straight into obscurity. The clues go from helpful to extremely vague and start making sense only after the fact ("...Oh, /that/'s what that meant.") You'll (sometimes) have a vague sense of what needs to be done - or rather, a collection of things that /can/ be done, though whether or not you're actually able to do them yet is unknown - and no idea how to do them or where to get them. It stops giving you goals on what you're supposed to be doing, removes any feeling of progression, and the game boils down to revisiting every area over and over and over again in the vague hope of finding something new. And when you do find something new, the experience is fleeting, because the new trinket or path or whatever it gives you is usually in another part of the game, wildly far from you.\n\n\nTL;DR: unless you are a masochist with rediculous amounts of free time and patience, you will need a walkthrough for this game at some point. The level design does not guide you along at all, and is actively obtrusive. The difficulty changes from basic survival to constantly trying figuring out the developer's logic like you're playing an old Lucas Arts point-and-click from back in the day. Granted that may apppeal to some of you; the game does not hold your hand, especially mid and onwards, and there can be value in that.\n\n\nAll that said, I'm still going to buy La Mulana 2 when it comes out, because at the end of the day, the game is still fun to me.","April 23, 2015","true","43.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I first ever played this game, I couldn’t figure what the heck I was supposed to do. That was until I learned you can use the challis to teleport out of the temple and back to the surface, and that’s where the rea fun begins.\n\nThe basic idea of the game is for players to transverse through a very large and difficult temple, filled with items that make your more powerful, traps that cause massive amounts of damage, monsters who try to get in your way, and gigantic boss who try to kill you quickly. Once a player gets into a dire state, they are teleport out of the temple to heal themselves and then return back to the temple to try to get even deeper into La-Mulana.\n\nThis game is not for everyone, it can be extremely frustrating and will most likely cause you to run around in circles for hours trying to figure out what the heck to do next. What makes it fun to me is the fact that it is extremely challenging and each puzzle’s solution is hidden in a mystery; they don’t hold your hand like most games do these days.\n\nI grew up in a video game era were video games would just throw you into the action and it was up to you to you figure it out yourself.

The controls aren't explained well initially, and it takes time to get a feel for the platforming mechanics, which are fairly idiosyncratic.  It's not an easy game either; it pulls very few punches and is much stingier than most modern games about checkpoint placement and health recovery.  There are also several fairly tough puzzles that require some creative interpretation of the sometimes-badly-translated hints strewn throughout the game.\n\nDespite all of the above, this is quite simply one of the largest and most satisfying Metroidvania games I've ever played.  The maps are massive, the backstory is interesting and integrated into the puzzles.  The power-ups are fun, and the weapons provide enough variety to be satisfying without being numerous enough that any of them feel like afterthoughts.

It's a Metroidvania, there are plenty of skills and items to find, etc.\nThere are a lot of good things to say about this game.  The combat is great.  You start with only a whip but you get different items over time including a Katana.  The menu system is very innovative; your character is equipped with a mobile PC which has multiple functions including deciphering ancient tablets and using your map!  You can equip and unequip these "programs" depending on how much "memory" you have available in your PC!\nThe puzzles are interesting.  This game will make you think, but it's also action packed!\n\nThe only problem I have is the old school jumping mechanics.  Like in the classic 2D adventure games of old, you can't change direction in mid-jump.  You're committed once you're in the air.  Also, when you fall from a ledge, you're forward momentum stops and you fall straight down.  If you want to move horizontally, you'll have to jump first!  You CAN control the height of your jump, however.\n\nAnother con is the resolution.  If you have a 16:9 monitor, you'll have bars on the right and left sides, but you can enable cool artwork to take up that space!\n\nThis is one of those games where you have to do a little bit of researching the manual.  You need some things from the merchants in the starting area before you can fully explore.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game wholeheartedly.

Even after almost 6 hours I've only found and defeated one boss, but I rarely feel like I'm wandering around aimlessly. I feel like I'm gathering clues to solve a huge puzzle...and most of the time that's exactly what I'm doing. Every time I backtrack I find something new, or decipher a cryptic note I didn't understand the last time. It's like a tougher and more puzzle-oriented Super Metroid with some I Wanna Be The Guy-style traps. Hints come in the form of emails from the village elder as well, but they're not too revealing, just a little nudge to help you get going. Expect to be writing some things down on your journey.\n\nMy only complaint is the controls, which I suppose are supposed to be realistic, but even after 6 hours I'm still not used to them. When you jump you're committed to it; forward jumping has a set arc depending on how high you jump that can't be interrupted, and jumping straight up is uncontrollable until you reach the height of the jump. Falling off a ledge forces you to plummet straight down. It's somewhat irritating at times, but it's tolerable.","July 6, 2014","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I admit, I was a bit skeptical at first because I loved the original version (which was free, by the way), but honestly, almost everything has been improved. The graphics, the controls, everything. My only problem: holly [expletive], is it hard. I'm not a "hard-core" gamer, so when a game is as challenging as this, sure I like to find out how to beat the challenge, but a lot of times it just ends up frustrating me. Also, at the time I'm writing this, I haven't even made it past the second boss yet.\nWhich brings me to another GOOD thing about it: it's non-linear. At the moment I'm trying to level up my main weapon and increase my health to hopefully make the second boss WAY easier.

There are caches of money salted around the tomb, which you can find by basically whipping random walls. It would be nice if they had some clues to these; you may want to consider a walkthough to help locate these.

If you haven't had to look up a solution by the time you reach the Gate of Illision, you will then.\nThe combat and movement is very finely tuned, not too often did I feel that my death was unjustified, it was usually due to my own lack of skill or even missing critical equipment for an encounter.

Upon recovering the Hooly Grail after solving a few simple puzzles in the enterance of La-Mulana you will gain the ability to teleport between save points from anywhere inside this sprawling dungeon.\nHealth recovery in this game is a little strange, you recover your HP by sitting on hot springs or by collecting enough EXP from green orbs dropped by foes to equal the full length of your health bar upon which your EXP will be reset to 0 and your HP will be fully restored to %100 reguardless of how much health you have at the time.

The sheer majesty of this game is shocking. From the humble and simple beginnings of just swinging my whip at snakes to collect gold, never would I have imagined the insane depth and enjoyment that would follow for a massive sprawling adventure.\n\nIt took me 80 hours to beat the game and I only looked up a few things... Shamefully... an experience this phenomonal SHOULD BE PLAYED WITHOUT A GUIDE, no matter how stuck you think you are. You CAN solve pretty much every puzzle without a guide, but only if you think deeply and carefully. You really do get the sense of being like Indy Jones, reading, studying, obsessing over the many cryptic hints sprawled all over. The game can be solved in different ways with different levels of item completion, oh, and it has a hardcore mode too, as if it wasn't hard enough already!\nThis kind of cryptic riddle solving is usually not my type of game, and yet I found myself hopelessly addicted to solving the ancient and increasingly fascinating mysteries of La-Mulana.\n\nThe reward of finally solving some nasty riddle, or defeating one of the many very challenging bosses is a new visually exciting zone, more awesome powerups, with yet another great music to go with it..... zone after zone.... I was blown away by how big the game was, and how much great music is here. This is one of the most incredible gaming soundtracks in history. The game is worth 15 bucks on the music alone.\n\n\nStill on the fence about this? Let me put it to you bluntly.....\n\n\nDid you love Super Metroid?\nyeah?\n\nTHEN YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO PLAY LA-MULANA!!! THERE IS NO EXCUSE! This game is NOT for the weak willed who cry to momma when the game kicks their behind, and it will, time and time again! And it makes no apologies for it. Bats will constantly knock you into spikes, pits, and doom! OH THE FREAKING BATS!!! STOP IT !!! STOOOOOP IT!!!!!! NOOOOOO!!!\n\nL2P NOOB OR DIE!!\nPrepare to rage harder then you have EVER raged at a game before. I PROMISE YOU WILL HATE THIS GAME at times! You will SCREAM in anger and agony from that *blankity* horrible and unfair knockback mechanic!.... and yet....... by the end of the game... you should realize it was a big part of the challange and taught you to PLAY BETTER!\nI rage quit many times... yet I was helpless and unable to stay away for long. I haved learned to deeply appreciate and love the challenge found in this game.\n\n\nCONCLUSION----\n\nTight controls, fun progression with awesome powerups, very challenging, intellectually stimulating, teasingly addictive gameplay, stunning soundtrack, awesome visuals, epic boss battles, humongous game, fascinating story and lore, wicked awesome clever riddles, hard mode, speed run mode, boss rush mode, hell bonus level, a bathing suit, THIS GAME HAS IT ALL! All while kicking your posterior to kingdom come.\n\nI am a very jaded cynical gamer.... and yet..\n\nLa-Mulana is one of the GRANDMASTERS, a true CHAMPION of gaming history. I feel sorry for anyone who's too much of a wuss to stick with it and solve it. They are missing out on one of the very best gaming has to offer in 40 years of gaming history period.","April 27, 2014","true","81.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of these puzzles can be quite difficult to solve, but then you really feel you accomplished something. But even if you feel stuck, just go to another area, as many parts of the ruins can be accessed from the beginning. Others can be reached by obtaining certain items.\nThere's a lot of different items, main and sub weapons to be found, each serving a certain purpose. So this gets elevated to a Metroidvania-style game.\nYou even do not have to fight the bosses in a fixed order to progress. As for those boss battles, these are varied as well: There are stationary ones, in one fight you ride a track down in a mine-cart, while the foe follows you.\nAwesome.\n\nMy only gripe in the game is some very obscure hints for certain puzzles. You probably might have to look up somewhere or trying out a lot there - but be assured, there so much to do in the game, You will never feel bad, if you 'cheated' after you clocked so many hours into the game already. Just check that thing in a suspicious room further (or go somewhere else, as stated above) and move on your own.\nThe controls themselves are solid and work as intended. Only jumping down below properly needs some practice first. Lemeza falls straight down, if he doesn't jump from a cliff, unable to change direction. Luckily there is no fall damage and many regular enemies only do little damage, except for some sub and main bosses.\nTake a hop before jumping on platforms below you - and you can move Lemeza in mid-air. Required for certain puzzles and just being a small hint.\nI play the game with a keyboard by the way, while the game has full controller support, including XBOX360 support as in the dscription, and there's no problem with controlling that way as well.\n\nThe Graphics are really well done. They are stretched in fullscreen, the aspect ratio is mantainted properly. In widescreen formats the black bars can be decorated with murals and other images by going into the Options menu - which is a nice touch. Each ruin is vastly different, many background objects and statues are unique (and often required to be examined further by the game). There's even a hidden area, where you explore some of the original areas with the MSX-style graphics from the 2005 version.\n\nMusic and sound are nicely done as well. While the tracks might repeat too quickly, many of the areas (in my case, e. g. the Temple of Moonlight) have catchy background music, some more decent, others being more dominant. For anyone who likes videogame music, this might be just right. The sound effects help you, be it a breakable wall which makes a certain crumble noise if struck by (certain) weapons, different tunes whenever you fail or solve a puzzle and other effects.\n\nIf you don't mind the difficulty at times and love either cool boss battles and some brain-teasing puzzles, get this game ASAP. It's worth every penny, especially at that bargain in this sale.","December 26, 2013","true","86.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's the feeling of exploration that you don't get from other genres, an air of freedom that's restricted only by your equipment and skill, the challenge of reaching something new that's mere inches over the tower of angry crazed monstrocities that haven't tasted food in centuries, just waiting for you to slip... It's amazing.\nLa Mulana definitely met what I was looking for. It's a scarilly difficult game, but it's fantastic. If you're willing to brave the countless monsters lurking around the ruins, and smart enough to outwit the builders of these crazy traps and puzzles, this game is for you. There's treasure to be found, people to help, and a mess of bosses and sub-bosses that will have you rattling the controller in rage... in a good way. The game is beyond the simple word "challenging", which is flung around too often these days.\nBe warned though, brute force is NOT the answer to the majority of puzzles. You have to be smart with this game. Bosses themselves are a puzzle of what is safe, and what... isn't. And believe me, if you make a mistake with bosses, the all too common game over screen should be enough to tell you to try something else. If in doubt, look to the manual on the website. If that's not enough, there's no shame in looking to a guide. This game, in a few cases, demands it.","December 27, 2013","true","50.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Less than 3% unlock hell temple (...which involves, among other things, falling for 20 screens down an infinite lava pool and then breaking a false wall...), and I'm pretty sure that less than half a percent finish it.\n\nLa Mulana is one of THOSE games.  ..and walkthroughs are plentiful.\n\nIt is a personal challenge to anyone that dares try it, and a bragging right to anyone that manages to complete it.  It is full of false walls, obscure puzzles, and insane challenges -- in the most enthusiastically realistic retro fashion.  It is a trap-filled, monster-filled, puzzle-filled dungeon, where you must summon and destroy eight bosses across sixteen-ish zones, collect all manner of random crap, and take advantage of quirky item interactions that you have very little way to foresee.  It is immense, it is gorgeous, it is La Mulana.\n\nIt is at this point that you can probably tell whether this sounds torturous or fun to you.  Or maybe a little of both.  It's definitely not for everyone, but it IS fun to watch someone fail at vicariously for a couple hours.  I'll be poking at it as a longterm goal.","December 13, 2013","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reminds me a lot of the old NES games "Milon's Secret Castle" and "Tombs and Treasures", but with puzzles that actually make sense. It's still very challenging though, and its secrets are not easily discovered. It is concievably possible to beat this without any use of guides, though.\n\nThe action/platforming portions of the game can be a bit aggravating at times, but they mostly serve as a platform to deliver the puzzles rather than the focus of the game itself. Still worth a go in my opinion.","April 27, 2013","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay reminds me a lot of the original Metroid, and then you're whipping skeletons just like Castlevania.\n\nI guess I was warned, but this is a hard game.  As if fighting your way through the ruins wasn't hard enough already there are hidden booby traps (frustrating, but adds a fun new element as well).\n\nI love the mix of cultural artifacts from around the world you see, and I like the story of the Mother Goddess who created the Earthly races in hopes they could return her to the heavens--and who periodically kills them off when they anger her.\n\nYou find lots of clues on stone tablets (which may apply to something you'll find in a whole different area).  In theory it'd be fun to piece together the story like this, but I've found them more difficult to understand and sort of generic sounding (this is probably do in part to the translation from Japanese).\n\nI've made some progress (defeated one boss) and am hoping I can get past the difficulty factor and really get into this game, but it's possible I might give up.\n\n\n","June 14, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You run around a vast interconnected complex of ruins, whipping snakes and skeletons and bats and whatnot, solving puzzles, jumping, falling on spikes, etc. There are many little treasures to collect, powering up your character in some small way, often in such a way that is only really necessary for accessing a single area of the labyrinth, but giving you an actual ability rather than just throwing a key in your hand is a nice touch. The puzzles are many and quite esoteric, which I appreciate, though a few too many of them simply force you to return with some gadget, that more than likely required some other thing to solve its own puzzle. It definitely walks the line between intellectually engaging and tedious. The music is good. Overall the game has a lot of personality, doing things that seem a bit absurd from a design standpoint, but ultimately contributing to that intimate, programmed in somebody's mom's basement kind of feel that make Indie games the joy they are. Or can be, anyway. Where the game falls flat on its face is combat. Wonky collision, tedious enemies, needlessly frustrating bosses, pointless sub weapons, unresponsive controls, obnoxious healing mechanics, it's difficult to name something that was done right in terms of the combat design. The combat and platforming draw heavily, if not entirely, from NES era Castlevania. The whip has a little delay on it, your jump arc can't be altered (much) after you've left the ground, getting hit sends you flyiing, there are subweapons that, hypothetically at least, can fill in the gaps in your offensive capabillities. And that may have worked, if the level and enemy design had been borrowed from NES Catlevania as well. Instead, You find yourself navigating post-Symphony of the Night levels and enemies with pre-Symphony of the Night controls. Enemies move around a lot and in fairly random patterns, hitting them without getting hit yourself is a bit of a gamble (there's a very good reason fleamen only took one hit in Castlevania). You'll routinely find yourself knowcked off platforms and faced with a lengthy trek to return simply because a bat decided to move a certain way at a certain time. Many enemies are simply a matter of sitting and waiting for them to turn their back so you can hit them wothout risking your life (waiting is not skill). The subweapons are slow, weak, and generally go in a straight line, which begs the question of why there are even so many. It uses a bizarre healing mechanic. Enemies drop little health balls, but instead of restoring your health, they fill a bar underneath your health and then, once that bar is filled , all your health. This virtually guarantees that your health will be restored at some arbitrary moment, rather than when you would could actually benefit. Why the balls don't just restore your health directly is beyond me. The system can only be described as asinine. All of this would be tolerable, but what truly sinks the ship are the disastrous boss battles. Don't get me wrong, graphically the bosses are very impressive. Detailed, well animated, room-filling sprites certainly have an appeal about them. But the problem is that a massive room filling monstrosity has to be able to fight the player in such a way that justifies that level of detail. When, for all the charging and fire breath and crumbly cieling bits, the main threat, the biggest factor driving the difficulty of the fight, is not anything the boss is actually doing, but the difficulty inherent in negotiating the tiny area from which you can hit the boss without getting hit yourself, all that detail becomes a bit pointless. For a boss to attack the player in however many unique and interesting ways, but ultimately kill them because the player touched its chin a few too many times shows very bad combat design. I'm going to go farther and say that the concept of the player being hurt by touching enemies is an archaic anachronism and should be done away with. But whatever. Yeah, the game is hard. Hard in a very Dark Souls kind of way, where it's not really so much that you need to get good at it, but that you need to remember stuff and proceed slowly and not break your controller and all that noise. It's punishing and clunky and sort of poorly designed on purpose to make it more difficult. Sometimes that can be nice. I recommend it despite it's flaws. I dunno, play it or don't. It's unique, I respect that.","August 15, 2014","true","31.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls aren't explained well initially, and it takes time to get a feel for the platforming mechanics, which are fairly idiosyncratic.  It's not an easy game either; it pulls very few punches and is much stingier than most modern games about checkpoint placement and health recovery.  There are also several fairly tough puzzles that require some creative interpretation of the sometimes-badly-translated hints strewn throughout the game.\n\nDespite all of the above, this is quite simply one of the largest and most satisfying Metroidvania games I've ever played.  The maps are massive, the backstory is interesting and integrated into the puzzles.  The power-ups are fun, and the weapons provide enough variety to be satisfying without being numerous enough that any of them feel like afterthoughts.  In terms of content for the price, this game is an absolute steal.  If you have the chops for it, bring your action-platformer and adventure-game-puzzler A-games and take this one on right away.","June 3, 2015","true","112.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing technically special but the environments are based off designs of various cultures throughout the world. Enemies are based off some form of mythology. The bosses start off fairly intimidating then you encounter a satanic goat.\n\nThe sound track is great and there's even a sound test within the game. There's a variety of instruments used.\n\nStory:\n\nYou play an archelogist named Lemeza who tries to search for his father in the La Mulana Ruins. The lore of this game is found on ancient tablets and you piece together them to learn the history of this place.\n\nLemenza is a silent protagonist but there are other characters that offer hints to you adventure but are still somewhat funny. There's the old man obsessed with video games and like to tell obvious lies that are funny because how blunt it is. Too bad every other character is just exposition or shopkeepers telling you to buy something.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe controls are fine with keyboard but platforming is like Castlevania I on NES.\nJumping while moving gives you little control in manuvering your jump, but standing still and jumping will pause you in place for a second and then given full control of you jump. This isn't too much of a problem espcially once you get the double jump. The worst part of the platforming is when you walk off a ledge. You lose any form of movement until you reach the ground. This can be really annoying since you will climb up long vertical shafts.\n\nYou gain a large number of powerups and weapons that will help you through La Mulana. Weapons have different attack arcs that can help you hit certain enemies much easilly but you will probably stick with the whip with its hidden upgrades or the axe which has an excellent attack arc.\n\nThere's also sub weapons that provides a ranged attack that run on individual ammo system that can be switched around easilly once you find them. Weapons range from surikens to a very expensive but deadly pistol.\n\nThere's usable items that only serve the purpose of opening certain areas or reading tablets. There is one however that is very overpowered and can break nearly every sub boss.\n\nThe powerups are fairly simple to increased HP or movement speed, but none of them really change the game except the double jump powerup.\n\nThe last items you collect is computer software. Most of these items are either hidden or can bought in the store. They do various things like giving a map of the area granted you have the map of the place, or translate stone tablets. There's also hidden software combinations that cause special changes but you really don't know what it did.\n\nThe normal enemies are good in variety but some are designed just to make platforming really annoying. There's a medusa head like enemy that shoots arrows at you. They also cause the Lemeza to have knockback which can be very annoying when platforming.\n\nMost sub bosses you encounter can be dispatched with full HP with little strategy and the ones that can't be dispatched either test your paitence or requires actual skill. The main bosses are all pretty challening but lack variety of moves. Once you learn to dodge them while still able to deal damage, then they are no problem.\n\nOutside of fighting and platforming are puzzles and secrets throughout the entire place of La Mulana Ruins. Now this is the biggest strength and its biggest flaw. Be prepared to take notes on stone tablets because those will be hints to puzzles in the zone you are or in a completely different area.\n\nSome of the tablets are pretty clever.\n\nHowever, some are just vague. There's one that requires you to pause the game in certain places. Then find a hidden warp pipe that leads to 4 tablets that gives vague one word hints.\n\nThe amount of times I had to use a walkthrough is too much. Add some breakable/fake walls, or special hidden locks that can only be opened by a randomized summon.\n\nThe good news is that the most vague puzzles are optional and miss nothing too major. There's still some ungodly hidden secrets you need to solve.\n\nIf this game did not have puzzles, then it was still be a great game, but some puzzles are pretty good. There's great skill based obstacles you have to go through. This game still is very hard when it comes to combat.","January 9, 2015","true","110.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Progressing in La Milon's Secret Castle relies on mastering both the unforgiving jumping physics and extremely obtuse puzzles. The real draw of the game is, the underlying lore and story are closely linked to the puzzles for the most part via reading of tablets covered in cryptic text and primitive drawings where you can almost see the self-satisfied smug of the developer who drew them. Enemies are largely slow-moving piles of hitbox, whereas bosses are piles of hitbox that take up half of the screen. The weapons you're saddled with are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ enough to make the proceedings fairly challenging.\n\nThrough the end of all of this suffering and turmoil the rewards definitely await, with no shortage of Chicken McItems you can get your greasy fingers on. If you can take the time to read all the tablets, discern what area the hint originated from, what particular puzzle or setpiece the hint is actually referring to, and cross-reference this information in the same notebook for which you keep track of your Zoloft medication, you clearly deserve this game.\n\nOne thing I can attest is that this game helped me reignite the rage within my heart. At times a vein erupts in my forehead, I rip off my shirt and start beating my chest wildly, and it eventually takes 3 social workers and a powerful horse sedative to restrain me. 9/10 game, tell your friends.","September 10, 2013","true","44.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing technically special but the environments are based off designs of various cultures throughout the world. Enemies are based off some form of mythology. The bosses start off fairly intimidating then you encounter a satanic goat.\n\nThe sound track is great and there's even a sound test within the game. There's a variety of instruments used.\n\nStory:\n\nYou play an archelogist named Lemeza who tries to search for his father in the La Mulana Ruins. The lore of this game is found on ancient tablets and you piece together them to learn the history of this place.\n\nLemenza is a silent protagonist but there are other characters that offer hints to you adventure but are still somewhat funny. There's the old man obsessed with video games and like to tell obvious lies that are funny because how blunt it is. Too bad every other character is just exposition or shopkeepers telling you to buy something.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe controls are fine with keyboard but platforming is like Castlevania I on NES.\nJumping while moving gives you little control in manuvering your jump, but standing still and jumping will pause you in place for a second and then given full control of you jump. This isn't too much of a problem espcially once you get the double jump. The worst part of the platforming is when you walk off a ledge. You lose any form of movement until you reach the ground. This can be really annoying since you will climb up long vertical shafts.\n\nYou gain a large number of powerups and weapons that will help you through La Mulana. Weapons have different attack arcs that can help you hit certain enemies much easilly but you will probably stick with the whip with its hidden upgrades or the axe which has an excellent attack arc.\n\nThere's also sub weapons that provides a ranged attack that run on individual ammo system that can be switched around easilly once you find them. Weapons range from surikens to a very expensive but deadly pistol.\n\nThere's usable items that only serve the purpose of opening certain areas or reading tablets. There is one however that is very overpowered and can break nearly every sub boss.\n\nThe powerups are fairly simple to increased HP or movement speed, but none of them really change the game except the double jump powerup.\n\nThe last items you collect is computer software. Most of these items are either hidden or can bought in the store. They do various things like giving a map of the area granted you have the map of the place, or translate stone tablets. There's also hidden software combinations that cause special changes but you really don't know what it did.\n\nThe normal enemies are good in variety but some are designed just to make platforming really annoying. There's a medusa head like enemy that shoots arrows at you. They also cause the Lemeza to have knockback which can be very annoying when platforming.\n\nMost sub bosses you encounter can be dispatched with full HP with little strategy and the ones that can't be dispatched either test your paitence or requires actual skill. The main bosses are all pretty challening but lack variety of moves. Once you learn to dodge them while still able to deal damage, then they are no problem.\n\nOutside of fighting and platforming are puzzles and secrets throughout the entire place of La Mulana Ruins. Now this is the biggest strength and its biggest flaw. Be prepared to take notes on stone tablets because those will be hints to puzzles in the zone you are or in a completely different area.\n\nSome of the tablets are pretty clever.\n\nHowever, some are just vague. There's one that requires you to pause the game in certain places. Then find a hidden warp pipe that leads to 4 tablets that gives vague one word hints.\n\nThe amount of times I had to use a walkthrough is too much. Add some breakable/fake walls, or special hidden locks that can only be opened by a randomized summon.\n\nThe good news is that the most vague puzzles are optional and miss nothing too major. There's still some ungodly hidden secrets you need to solve.\n\nIf this game did not have puzzles, then it was still be a great game, but some puzzles are pretty good. There's great skill based obstacles you have to go through. This game still is very hard when it comes to combat.","January 9, 2015","true","110.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely some rewarding experiences to be found here. The fact that your character's picture beings to look like an insane wannabe batman as you progress is also great.\n\nThe worst part of La Mulana is the action-platformer side of things. This is a remake of an older game and that means you'll have to deal with the following anachronistic nonsense:\n\n- Input delays. If you jump straight up and try to move it will take a second before you actually move.\n- Locked falls. If you fall straight down instead of jumping down you will not be able to alter your landing.\n- Uncontrollable swimming. There's some built up momentum going on here that makes jumping out of water a pain.\n- Constantly jumping back when hit. You remember castlevania and its lovely pits, right?\n- Grinding for cash. Oddly, the game requires you to buy weights to activate switches and makes you grind for gold.\n- Finicky hitboxes. Bosses can only be hurt in the center of their heads, and you have to make sure you get real close for it to count.\n\nThe game gives you a lot of tools to try to work your way out of this (as most of the problems with the controls can be mitigated by using the ranged subweapons), but that puts you in the scenario of having to grind your way through parts you're stuck on - which is pretty much impossible as most enemies only drop 2 gold (if you're lucky).\n\nSo, the game wants you to fight with the melee wapons. That's fine. I just wish the controls were better. The fact that your jumps have committed arcs you can't maneuver out of really limits how you can safely engage an enemy.\nRun in gung-ho and expect to miss and take damage or trade. Even the double-jump power you get later doesn't give you the ability to jump away - you'll just jump further in the direction you were already moving.\n\n\nGood game. Great puzzles. ♥♥♥♥ controls.","March 17","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here was a Metroidvania in the strictest sense of the word, with an expansive hand-crafted map just waiting to be explored.  Pivotal items could be found anywhere, so you were constantly rewarded for investigating every nook and cranny.  These upgrades also allowed you to intuitively access new areas--for example, once you acquire an item that lets you breathe underwater, you can progress further in a watery area.\n\nAt this point, my only complaints were that save points are few and far between, and are often not located anywhere near bosses.\n\nAs I progressed through the game, I grew more and more frustrated.  Upgrades stopped being intuitive since the obstacles they got past became too obviously artificial.  For example, some items interact with arbitrary symbols found throughout the ruins, which you had no reason to believe were important at all.  This leads to a lot of directionless backtracking.\n\nEventually, I got stuck, looked at a guide, and was shocked at the number of required items that were hidden in unfairly obscure locations.  Stuff like "once you do X, a ceiling in an unrelated area that you've already explored becomes breakable with your whip".  Maybe a tablet somewhere contains a subtle hint that would point you in the right direction, but I feel this level of opaqueness is bad game design.  Super Metroid had plenty of hidden secrets, but there was almost always something unusual about the area to prompt you to scan it more closely with your X-Ray Scope.\n\nI'm unsure whether I will continue playing La-Mulana, but if I do, I expect to have to rely on a guide.  Despite this, I do see why the game was so influential, and I still think it has quite a lot to offer.","February 5","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I cheated and played the game with a guide, and *still* had an amazing time with it, and even played the game a couple more times. It's one of the best games ever made. I'm dead serious.\n\nThe game has fantastic music, amazing boss fights, and a huge expansive world with an incredibly deep lore. However, the game is full of extremely cryptic puzzles.\n\nHonestly, I recommend that you play this game until you get stuck, then go through the rest of it with a walkthrough. Some of the puzzles in this game are just not reasonable, and it's impossible to tell in advance the difference between reasonable puzzles, unreasonable puzzles, and puzzles you can't solve yet. It is also extremely non-linear, which complicates matters.\n\nIf you want to beat this game without help, I recommend against it, but here's my advice. There's very little in the game that is blatantly not hinted at, but many of the hints are extremely cryptic. Get a notepad and write down every single hint you come across (or screenshot them). And don't come into it with the attitude that you're going to clear one area at a time; after the initial Gate of Guidance, you have to hop back and forth between areas frequently to progess. Many of the puzzles require out-of-the-box thinking so be ready for that. Read the manual and watch the Beginner's Guide. This game is tough as nails, and beating it is a project. Expect it to take hundreds of hours (if you use a guide, 10 hours). This is a real game.\n\nFor my friends, I love this game, and I know it inside and out, so if you want me to hint you in the right direction instead of resorting to a guide, I'm happy to talk about it any time.","November 5, 2013","true","72.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I essentially score like an arcade game "end of stage" thing would do. The higher the score, the better the game.\nA tiny fragment Lore for those who want to know Without heading into too spoilerrific waters, Lemeza Kosugi(your player character) heads to the ruins of La-Mulana to find the aforementioned Treasure of Life. That much can be summed up from the description on this store page. He only has a whip on arrival, however, dueirport security confiscated all of his other equipment. This tidbit was in the MSX original manual.\nImportant Control Traits:     Jump Style: Castlevania Arc: Hard to control midair unless you touch a wall.\nFalling: Straight down after walking off a ledge.\nKnockback level: Significant\nWater controls: Mildly aggravating.\nWeaknesses: Being crushed instantly kills. Lava drains HP quickly, Water drains slowly, Spikes and Retribution bolts take away 7% of maximum HP. The major points. This is where scoring comes into play.\nDifficulty Curve: Tends to maintain difficulty until lowering when  you get to Dimensional Corridor , raising at The Shrine of the Mother  and spikes at the bonus content. +700 for semi-stability, +10 for difficulty.\nContent: Over 20 areas to explore, all but one having a unique track. +2500 for massive content, +50 for side content.\nMusic: Satisfying, catchy and will likely ring in your ears for a while.  Bonus content, I'm looking at you right now. +750\nTime allotment: around 25% puzzles, 25% combat, 20% looking around, and the rest in bonus content. +4000 for lasting as long as a certain brand of gum.\nSecret content: 5% of the game's areas qualify as this. It is up to you to find out how to access it, however.  Defeat all 8 guardians before even trying.+700\nReplayability: not very much, surprisingly.  The credits gain more characters based on certain criteria, but that's about it.  +1 point for replaying.\nBonus Content: Yes. This content will, however, cause you significant self-performed hair loss.  +3050 for Fun. Dwarf Fun. The final rank:\nA+ with 11,760 points. A fun, interesting experience for players used to the format. Definitely not an easy first game, and certainly not for beginners.

It wisely understands that playing a game about an action-archaeologist exploring mysterious ruins means hurling you into a confusing unknown, and everything about its play reinforces that. It's fantastically sprawling, fantastically confusing, and fantastically frustrating, but if you enjoy a taste of those elements, this could be the perfect game for you.\n\nIt's closest cousin is probably Super Metroid, but La-Mulana trades out the former's tight action gameplay for much, much, much more focus on puzzles and a look-before-you-leap mentality. And not just block-pushing shenanigans. (Though of course there's no shortage of that, of course.) La-Mulana demands that you approach your adventure like an actual archaeologist. You'll need to pay attention to details, take diligent notes, understand the history of the ruins, and never, ever, stop looking for new nooks and crannies to explore. Metroidvania-style games often feature an element of sequence-breaking, allowing diligent/skilled players to tackle the game in unusual orders. La-Mulana stands alone in being so massive and so uninterested in shepherding you along a default path that it's hard to say if there's a designated sequence at all. Even killing major bosses might yield nothing more than a pat on the back. Rare is the game that puts you so thoroughly on your own.\n\nThat said, there are a couple of fairly big dings that keep it out of masterpiece territory and closer to cult classic for masochists. For one, puzzles do branch into the realm of insane BS from time to time, and the game introduces (or rather, requires but does not introduce) a couple of unique environmental interactions along the way. Even if this kind of game is right in your sweet spot, keep the wiki bookmarked because you will need it at some point or another. Second, solving a puzzle triggers a confirmation sound effect but doesn't show you what was unlocked, which is a huge problem when the resulting change occurs screens or zones away. And finally, things continue escalating in complexity all the way to the finale. While that would be fine in something like a platformer, here it means that you will absolutely be following a guide for the last big puzzle, and that it doesn't feel like you've come full-circle on the mysteries of La-Mulana so much as the it feels like the game just throwing more and more craziness at you.","January 9","true","37.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I cheated and played the game with a guide, and *still* had an amazing time with it, and even played the game a couple more times. It's one of the best games ever made. I'm dead serious.\n\nThe game has fantastic music, amazing boss fights, and a huge expansive world with an incredibly deep lore. However, the game is full of extremely cryptic puzzles.\n\nHonestly, I recommend that you play this game until you get stuck, then go through the rest of it with a walkthrough. Some of the puzzles in this game are just not reasonable, and it's impossible to tell in advance the difference between reasonable puzzles, unreasonable puzzles, and puzzles you can't solve yet. It is also extremely non-linear, which complicates matters.\n\nIf you want to beat this game without help, I recommend against it, but here's my advice. There's very little in the game that is blatantly not hinted at, but many of the hints are extremely cryptic. Get a notepad and write down every single hint you come across (or screenshot them). And don't come into it with the attitude that you're going to clear one area at a time; after the initial Gate of Guidance, you have to hop back and forth between areas frequently to progess. Many of the puzzles require out-of-the-box thinking so be ready for that. Read the manual and watch the Beginner's Guide. This game is tough as nails, and beating it is a project. Expect it to take hundreds of hours (if you use a guide, 10 hours). This is a real game.\n\nFor my friends, I love this game, and I know it inside and out, so if you want me to hint you in the right direction instead of resorting to a guide, I'm happy to talk about it any time.","November 5, 2013","true","72.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The platforming physics are a bit wonky at first, and can mess up the gaming logic in your head, but it feels fair as you learn how to adapt to it (For example : In-game, if you jump moving right, you can only move right, but if you jump up without moving left or right, you can control your jump more. Also, touching a wall while jumping in a direction can give you back your aerodynamic control).\n\nThe main challenge of the game is solving these huge riddles that can really stump you if you don't have a guide, and at times, you might need to look at every aspect of details, or every word the game conveys, just because it can be very vital for solving these challenging puzzles. Aside from the riddles, the game isn't that difficult until you start reaching certain areas (especially in the early-game), or fight bosses (then again, if you're as skilled in video games as I am, hard mode isn't as hard as it seems, despite the extra deaths (which is all apart of the fun in a game)).\n\nAt the time of this review, I feel like I'm near mid-game, but I still feel like I just scratched the surface. The soundtrack is amazing, the satisfaction of solving a overly arching riddle is trumendous, and the bosses are quite challenging to fight. I highly recommend this game to the few that won't give up.\n\n(Also, if you're not sure about this game, there is a free version available looming around the internet with older graphics and slightly more frustrating moments, and equally great soundtrack. Just remember to patch the english translations, otherwise you'll get stumped quite easily)(Another thing I'd like to mention is that the official guide for this game is actually super useful!)","May 13","true","44.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here was a Metroidvania in the strictest sense of the word, with an expansive hand-crafted map just waiting to be explored.  Pivotal items could be found anywhere, so you were constantly rewarded for investigating every nook and cranny.  These upgrades also allowed you to intuitively access new areas--for example, once you acquire an item that lets you breathe underwater, you can progress further in a watery area.\n\nAt this point, my only complaints were that save points are few and far between, and are often not located anywhere near bosses.\n\nAs I progressed through the game, I grew more and more frustrated.  Upgrades stopped being intuitive since the obstacles they got past became too obviously artificial.  For example, some items interact with arbitrary symbols found throughout the ruins, which you had no reason to believe were important at all.  This leads to a lot of directionless backtracking.\n\nEventually, I got stuck, looked at a guide, and was shocked at the number of required items that were hidden in unfairly obscure locations.  Stuff like "once you do X, a ceiling in an unrelated area that you've already explored becomes breakable with your whip".  Maybe a tablet somewhere contains a subtle hint that would point you in the right direction, but I feel this level of opaqueness is bad game design.  Super Metroid had plenty of hidden secrets, but there was almost always something unusual about the area to prompt you to scan it more closely with your X-Ray Scope.\n\nI'm unsure whether I will continue playing La-Mulana, but if I do, I expect to have to rely on a guide.  Despite this, I do see why the game was so influential, and I still think it has quite a lot to offer.","February 5","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, I've lost count of how many times I've played through it. I've even beaten Hell Temple once, though that was on the Playism version. Yes, this game was good enough that I bought it twice. Anyway.\n\nLa-Mulana is an open-world platformer that sends you, an archaeologist, delving into the eponymous ruins of La-Mulana. At first, you're only in it for the treasure, but the plot slowly unfolds into something much bigger than that. The controls, once you know why they are how they are, are fantastic. When I first played it, I was confused why the jumping was so strange, but after I learned that they were done like that to harken back to the MSX game Maze of Galious, it all made sense to me. The enemies, somewhat uniquely for a game like this, are purposefully only annoyances. The real challenge of the game is in its puzzles. While they are completely ingenius, I'm not ashamed to admit I used a guide for a lot of them. Even with that, however, the game was still an awesome experience, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a game that wants you to think.","December 7, 2015","true","55.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh, if you're afraid of being punished for your mistakes you can just get out now.\n\nYou can find everything you need to get started here: http://agtp.romhack.net/project.php?id=lamulana\n\nRunning the original version on modern windows require some finangling in the compatability settings, but it's fairly straightforward (Run as admin, compatability mode for XP service pack 2, 16-bit color mode.)\n\nThat being said, what this version offers over the original is a more streamlined experience. Some of the puzzles were switched out and brand new ones even thrown in. This updated version is a lot less obtuse. While I hated the new graphics at first, they certainly grew on me and it was nice to hear some of the songs in a modernized format.","February 5","true","37.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rook_dota/recommended/230700/","rook_dota","Rook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rook_dota/","355 products in account","La-Mulana pleasantly surprised me when I first started playing.  Here was a Metroidvania in the strictest sense of the word, with an expansive hand-crafted map just waiting to be explored.  Pivotal items could be found anywhere, so you were constantly rewarded for investigating every nook and cranny.  These upgrades also allowed you to intuitively access new areas--for example, once you acquire an item that lets you breathe underwater, you can progress further in a watery area.\n\nAt this point, my only complaints were that save points are few and far between, and are often not located anywhere near bosses.\n\nAs I progressed through the game, I grew more and more frustrated.  Upgrades stopped being intuitive since the obstacles they got past became too obviously artificial.  For example, some items interact with arbitrary symbols found throughout the ruins, which you had no reason to believe were important at all.  This leads to a lot of directionless backtracking.\n\nEventually, I got stuck, looked at a guide, and was shocked at the number of required items that were hidden in unfairly obscure locations.  Stuff like "once you do X, a ceiling in an unrelated area that you've already explored becomes breakable with your whip".  Maybe a tablet somewhere contains a subtle hint that would point you in the right direction, but I feel this level of opaqueness is bad game design.  Super Metroid had plenty of hidden secrets, but there was almost always something unusual about the area to prompt you to scan it more closely with your X-Ray Scope.\n\nI'm unsure whether I will continue playing La-Mulana, but if I do, I expect to have to rely on a guide.  Despite this, I do see why the game was so influential, and I still think it has quite a lot to offer.","February 5","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you stick with it, and forgive yourself for using a guide every now and then, you'll get a very distinct satisfaction upon finishing the game. Suddenly all the other evil puzzle platformers seem a bit more quaint. So be aware! You will get stuck, and you will die on the same rooms/enemies/bosses over and over and over again, but if you can learn to enjoy the pain of defeat, La-Mulana will tenderly embrace you with its sandpaper arms and razorblade fingers.

The platforming physics are a bit wonky at first, and can mess up the gaming logic in your head, but it feels fair as you learn how to adapt to it (For example : In-game, if you jump moving right, you can only move right, but if you jump up without moving left or right, you can control your jump more. Also, touching a wall while jumping in a direction can give you back your aerodynamic control).\n\nThe main challenge of the game is solving these huge riddles that can really stump you if you don't have a guide, and at times, you might need to look at every aspect of details, or every word the game conveys, just because it can be very vital for solving these challenging puzzles. Aside from the riddles, the game isn't that difficult until you start reaching certain areas (especially in the early-game), or fight bosses (then again, if you're as skilled in video games as I am, hard mode isn't as hard as it seems, despite the extra deaths (which is all apart of the fun in a game)).\n\nAt the time of this review, I feel like I'm near mid-game, but I still feel like I just scratched the surface. The soundtrack is amazing, the satisfaction of solving a overly arching riddle is trumendous, and the bosses are quite challenging to fight. I highly recommend this game to the few that won't give up.\n\n(Also, if you're not sure about this game, there is a free version available looming around the internet with older graphics and slightly more frustrating moments, and equally great soundtrack. Just remember to patch the english translations, otherwise you'll get stumped quite easily)(Another thing I'd like to mention is that the official guide for this game is actually super useful!)","May 13","true","44.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
