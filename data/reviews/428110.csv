You're definitely not going to see anything that totally turns match-3 on its head, but if you're looking for an inexpensive chill match-3 game this one stands out as really well done with a really campy style.","June 3","true","11.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The visuals are bright and colourful and animate very fluidly across the board. If you\'re into match three games then you kind of have to get this one.","June 1","true","6.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
