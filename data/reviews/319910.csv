Trine 3 is a disaster. In short:\n\n+ nice graphics\n+ ok story\n\n- full of bugs of any kind (wall and object glitches, broken doors , buggy bossfights, ...)\n- 3 D game principle is almost impossible to play (controlling characters is too vague and confusing)\n- no more skills (yup, that means no ice arrows, no planks ect) the characters start with some "new" skills but they lack "old" skills and there is no way to learn new skills (so no leveling up in general!)\n- levels are too easy! there are almost no passages which require teamwork!\n- collecting pyramids unlocks new levels (which means if you do not have enough of them you have to play an old level AGAIN to collect some more before you can move forward to the next level!!)\n- the game ends right in the middle of the story... and it is not even an "open ending" or something. The wizzard just says "Great now we only need two more [...] to repair the [...]" [spoiler ^^] and then you see the credits\n\nResult:\nGame is super frustrating thanks to all the bugs, very short and ends in the middle of the story! Please do NOT buy it.\n\nP.S. I feel sorry for the Community Manager who has to go through all the negative feedback but I feel so betrayed and disappointed that I just couldn't help but warn people NOT to buy this game.","October 21, 2015","false","10.9"," 1,504 of 1,658 people (91%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","91","504","1","41","40"

Beautiful levels, a ton of well hidden collectibles and achievements that engage the completionist in me for hours.\n\nTrine 3 falls short on almost all of those aspects...\nLets address all the postives first:\nThe game is still incredibly beautiful, the art style is amazing.\nThe soundtrack, as in previous installments is amazing, although other people might think differently.I wish I could say more positive things about this game, I really do.\n\nOn to the negative:\nThe gameplay, i'll address each of the heroes seperatly:\nFirst off, Amadeus. I realize that 3D doesnt really allow for the Wizard's old method of drawing shapes to summon Boxes/Planks, but the fact that you are now reduced to summoning only a single Box really bums me out. The most fun aspect of playing the Wizard in the previous games was to find fun ways of stacking all possible summoned objects to find your way around the environment, all you get to do now is summon your Box and slam it to the ground. Yay. *sigh*\nZoya... poor Zoya... Her Explosive, Gravity and Ice Arrows have been removed, you are reduced to firing single, plain, wooden arrows. Aiming isnt really necessary anymore, point in the vague direction of a target and Zoya usually finds her target automatically. Her hooks are reduced to only being able to attach to rings and boxes in the environment. No more swinging along wooden ceilings, branches and platforms, Personally, I don't mind that too much, it opens up a couple of other possibilities, but those are usually fairly obvious and straight forward (Attaching your hook to a door knob, pulling it open and tieing it around a pole to keep it from slamming shut for example).\nPontius propably changed the least, he's still good old Pontius with a Sword and Shield but without the hammer, and i don't understand why. I mostly understand why Zoya and Amadeus had their abilities changed the way they were, but why can't the knight have his hammer? Would have made combat more interesting, or made it possible for him to knock down walls and objects in the environment. Pontius gets his gliding ability right of the bat, makes platforming easier, but makes Zoya even less necessary for some sections.What bothered me quite a bit was the complete lack of a progression system. No more skill trees and customization, all characters play the same forever. Meh.\nThe game is INCREDIBLY short. I've beat the game in 4.4h and got 100% completion. The collectibles arent really hidden too much, if they are, it's still rather obvious.\nThe story was fine, but it didn't nearly engage me as much as the previous games, all in all it felt like the intro to a much larger story, especially considering it ends on a cliffhanger.\nEnemies felt weird, fight's were honestly boring. There arent really any different enemy types. Some have shields(that really dont make them any tougher), some don't, some are large, some aren't. The only enemies that felt special were the Wizards that appear later in the game, although they didnt really spice combat up either. Their attacks are easily avoidable and they go down with a couple of Zoya's arrows. There are only 2 bigger fights, one at the start of the second level which is incredibly easy to fight and the final boss, which i found rather random and uninteresting as well.\nIn the previous games combat could be quite challenging, jumping around enemies, watching out for archers, getting creative with Amadeus' abilities, etc.\nIn Trine 3 combat was just boring. I usually simply mashed the button with Pontius and shot the flying wizards with Zoya when everything on the ground was dead...I know why the game is as short as it is, the developers have adressed that in a forum post here, but that doesn't change the fact that it's just not worth the price.\nGet the game when it's on sale at some point, I think it's definitely overpriced at this point.\n\nI have to say that 3D didn't really add anything to the game, if anything it subtracted from it...\nI just hope the developers recognize what's gone wrong in this game and go back to what they're truly excellent at: 2D or 2.5D","August 23, 2015","false","6.4"," 683 of 766 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","683","766","12","19"

While this is matter of taste, i have enjoyed the work of Ari Pulkkinen in previous games and he did do good in this title as well\n\nAnd thats about it unfortanetly, to move to negative sides then\n\n-Length. the game is ridiculously short in comparision to previous titles. I played it trough with friends in 4 hours. If you were to skip side missions in the game, which hold no real value. Theyre just mini levels or an arena where youre locked to single character. also if you were not to fool around alot like we did. You could finish this game under 2 hours easily\n\n-Character progression. unlike in previous tittles, this one has none of it. no talent trees, no new weapons, no new skills or spells. instead youve actually been reduced at amount abilities in this game in comparision to others. wizard can do only a box, knight has only sword and shield and the thief has only one type of arrow.\n\n- 3d. While it did have some interesting usage in the game, with thiefs rope and such. over all i would say it came with negative impact to the game. the camera angle can get very awkward at times, especially if youre intending to backtrack. It also glitches the knight somewhat where youre actually capable of wall jumping of the side walls and the back walls, if you glide while youre doing so. you are capable of reaching infinite height and pretty much can skip all the puzzles if you so desire.\n\n\n-Price. For a game this short, the pricing is way too steep. 20/22€ for a 2-4h game is way too much in my books.\nI do feel like ive made a mistake for buying the game this early, as for me that is too high price for the content im getting.\n\n-Bugs. There is quite alot of those, the earlier mentioned knight wall jumping i imagine being one, others being objects going crazy randomly, your ghost after death going out of level, in air or just simply disappearing so you cannot be ressurrected. Also the online multiplayer having quite a few bugs tied to it too. only host being able to destroy some of the boxes containing triangles, there being laggy things and what not.\n\nOver all it felt like i did get 25% of trine game i were expecting.\n\nAs extra notion, i can say vaguely that the ending is a cliffhanger and very abrupt. which does tell they're intending to adding dlc to the game most likely or a sequel. But untill they do and if its free or changes the game drastically, I simply cannot recommend this game.","August 20, 2015","false","4.7"," 464 of 567 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","464","567","4","2"

The music is charming, the graphics are more advanced than before and they are truly using the 3D enviroment for puzzles, secrets and other sort of stuff rather than just a gimmick.\n\nI finished the first two levels, this is where the Early Access ends. I didn't finish the challenge map yet.\n\nThe story levels are fairly long, filled with a ton of content, little graphichal details, hidden collectibles you can get, and fully utilizes the 3D enviroment. You have to glide from the near to the far with Pontius, you can pull a rope around a pillar with Zoya, etc.\nThe characters have face now and you can see them moving their lips as they speak, they are more detailed now.\nThe puzzles were fairly easy in the first two stages, or it could just be me who used to these kind of stuff.\nMusic and sound good as ever.\n\nThe only negative I can say about this that it is lagging (dropping FPS or call it whatever you want) even on Medium settings with anti-alias off. I beat it on Low settings which is sad and I didn't run it on a microwave.\n\n9/10 looking forward for the updates and the full game as well.","April 21, 2015","true","8.5"," 227 of 272 people (83%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","83","227","272","13","13"

Despite all of the negative reviews, I bought the game because I like Frozenbyte's esthetics, as displayed in Trine 1 & 2, and because while playing 1 & 2, I kept wishing the player characters could move into the scenery instead of staying stuck in 2D.\n\nLooking over the negative reviews, the complaints fall into these categories:\n\nStrangely, the nastiest reviews go on, and on, about how Trine 3 is different than Trine 1 and 2.  In other words, because some people expected Trine 3 to be like Trine 1 and 2, they gave bad reviews.  In actuality, these 'reviews' are just gripes about personal preferences.  Very few negative comments actually describe what the game _is_.  Imagine Trine 3 was actually just the first Trine game released.  Would reviews saying the game didn't meet someone's personal preferences have any value to anyone?\nToo short for the money.\nOK, I wish the game was longer too. However, I've paid $20 or so for quite a few games over the years that turned out to be dull or just no fun.  I found Trine 3 to be fun and worth the money.\nBugs/technical issues.\nYup, there are some bugs. In multiplayer, one of my group had some strange graphics bugs. The problems went away after restarting the game. I suspect an old graphics driver was the culprit. None of the bugs we encountered prevented completion of the game.\nRemember how Frozenbyte said they ran out of money?  The game is definitely playable; they should get some credit for achiving that much during a money crisis.\nAbout what the game IS\nI found Trine 3 to be graphically beautiful.  The puzzles are pretty easy compared to other platform games, but I enjoyed the scenery enough that I didn't mind.  Attempting to avoid a spoiler, one section has simulated paper...  It is inspired; I hope to see this again in the future.\nI enjoyed the 3D environment. Despite being an 'on-a-rail' type of game, there is enough freedom to explore. You can take a break to look around and appreciate the view.  You can't get the camera to show every location your player can reach, such as behind buildings, but there is nothing hidden there so it doesn't really matter. You can walk of cliffs and die. So try to avoid it (like in real life).  One minor complaint is in multiplayer, when a player dies, the 'ghost' of the player sometimes levitates to a location ahead of the other players, so you might have to wait a bit before another player can reach your ghost to resurrect it.\nYou can map the commands to the buttons and keys of your choice, which I always appreciate since I don't use the standard WASD mapping.\nUsing PC keyboard and mice it took my group a few tries to defeat the end game boss. I think a controller would have been easier, especially for jumping in non-cardinal directions.  But even one younger player who is typically easily frustrated, didn't even think of giving up.  I expect we will replay this again, like we did Trine 1 and 2.\n\nNote to Frozenbyte: You can't please everybody. You took a risk to go to 3D. You learned from it. I hope you don't give up on 3D because I enjoy it and I think you did it right.  I bought three copies at full price and we weren't disappointed.  If you try again with Kickstarter, I'll be there.  Hopefully you'll get enough cash to work out more bugs and avoid some of the negative reviews.  Some people complained they didn't like some of the voice acting.  After listening to some poor English overdubs of Anime, I had no problems at all with your voice cast.","September 28, 2015","true","12.5"," 213 of 279 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","213","279","10","0"

Something weird has happened with the calculation or logins but believe me - I played this game start to finish for a LOT longer than one hour, as I also completely finished Trine 1 and 2.\n\nI'm a huge fan of the Trine series but I just cannot recommend Trine 3. If I could only use two words to describe this game they would be:\n\nBeautiful and FRUSTRATING!!!\n\nSeriously it's like this game wasn't even tested by average players. Most of the quests are side quests are too hard, and most aggrivating of all - if you die you have to start ALL over again including the loading screens! The skill required to complete even some of the main questline makes it seem to me like the game was only ever playtested by the actual developers.\n\nSo, constructive criticism for the Trine team because you guys are awesome and you deserve constructive feedback for Trine 4.\n\nGOOD THINGS ABOUT TRINE 3\n--------------------------------------\n* Breathtakingly beautiful colors and graphics\n* Fun, well-loved characters\n* Witty dialogue and a decent enough storyline\n* Good puzzles (just too hard)\n* Very good controller support (thank you!)\n* Lovely soundtrack\n* An enchanting world to play in, as with all the Trine adventures\n\nHORRIFYING THINGS ABOUT TRINE 3\n---------------------------------------\n* The semi-3D approach to platformers, argh this was so innacurate and so NOT fun to play please don't do it again. The Trine series loses absolutely nothing by being a pure 2D platformer, that is part of it's charm!\n* The clear lack of playtesting by non-hardcore gamers.\n* How utterly useless both Zoya and Amadeus are in combat (especially Zoya's shooting arc - way too limited)\n* Biggest bugbear - The way side quests had to be started over (and over and over) when you died in them. Surely resurrection points could have been included in the side quests as well?\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm looking forward to seeing how Trine 4 is developed.","October 11, 2015","false","1.1"," 233 of 308 people (76%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","76","233","308","9","5"

Trine one and two are tremendous fun and a great way to lose friends as you constantly sabotage each other’s attempts to solve the most basic of puzzles.\n\nTrine 3 is the first Trine game in full 3d and it suffers from the same camera and control issues that plagued early Playstation one games. It’s also full of bugs, some monsters refuse to move even after you hit them, on multiplayer some of us would load in to find that they had no character to control and some areas of the map refused to load until we restarted. My favourite bug by far was when you played as the warrior, you could walk up just about any wall by hammering the A button. This would allow you to spam your way out of bounds and around puzzles. This is such an obvious exploit that I refuse to believe the developers didn’t know about it on release.\n\nSo what happened? Why did Frozenbyte drop the ball on this one? Turns out they ran out of money:\nhttps://archive.is/2dZDH\n\nLong story short, the games not finished and while they have said they will patch the game in the future they have no plans to extend the length of the game (not even via DLC).

Really, I did. And I can honestly say I enjoyed Trine 3 during the Early Access period, hoping to see much more content in the final game. Sadly, there is not too much new content. As many said before me, Trine 3 is incredibly short. 3 introduction levels focused on each hero, 5 standard levels. These 8 levels can't last more than 3 hours. Of course there are some side missions, but they are merely a bonus challange, a desperate attempt to do something about the short gametime.\n\nAnother significant problem? Bugs. Almost every aspect of the game, every feature is bugged and full of errors. Camera, physics, animations, controls, cooperation elements, Steam achievements... simply put, the whole game is incredible bugfest. It certainly doesn't seem like finished product, more like a beta. Playable content is there, but it's not polished and it needs a lot of testing. Bugs can ruin everything, from some interesting puzzle to basic things like selection of already unlocked and completed levels.\n\nBut wait. In fact, playable content is not there, at least it seems. Remember that awesome character development combined with slight RPG features in Trine 2? It's missing. Treasure chests? Missing. More weapons and abilities for each hero? Missing. Some really interesting story? As you may probably guess, it's missing, too. It feels like too many features were sacrificed during the attempt to transfer the whole Trine experience from 2D to 3D. By the way, the story and especially its ending is another problem. All I could say about the "ending" was simple: "What the hell was that?" Not to mention the final boss. Every so-called boss in the game is not really entertaining or challanging, but the last one is a joke. Really strange and poorly executed joke.\n\nI certainly see some potential in Trine 3. Conversion to 3D is interesting, graphics combined with art style and level design is really beautiful and the soundtrack is simply awesome. Basic gameplay is fine and I am also grateful for Steam Workshop support and good optimisation (at least on my hardware). But that's not enough. There are too many bugs and other errors, too few levels. This is NOT the Trine 3 I was waiting for and I can't reccomend it to anyone.\n\nMaybe one day, if the developers properly eliminate all the bugs, add new levels and really release something which could be called a "finished game", I will change my mind and recommend the game to my friends, just as I did during the times of Trine 2. But right now, it's a mess. And it's really painful to see that the trend of unfinished sequels with lack of important content has come to indie sphere. Maybe it's not fair to compare indie and AAA titles, but current state of Trine 3 is very similar to the initial state of games such as Assassin's Creed: Unity, F1 2015 or Batman: Arkham Knight. And that's simply wrong.","August 21, 2015","false","6.9"," 166 of 218 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","166","218","0","0"

Perhaps they could have kept in a couple 3D transition parts, which gave some spectacular vistas etc. It would have significantly reduced the scope on a lot of levels and allowed for much longer game and more complete story. They even mentioned in the forum that they had a better game and story written, but the 3D made it too expensive and unwieldy.\n\nThey also put in a bit too many destructible items. Sure it is nice, but having a fence that can break just makes it easier to fall off the map. It must have also taken more production time as a result. The levels, however were incredibly detailed and goorgious. The models were amazing to look at. However, due to its length, it did not have the variety of Trine 2.\n\nThe 3D also reduced the capabilities of the characters and barely added to the puzzles. They took so much away, like the leveling system and most of the character abilities.\n\nThe game is a bit buggy too. I often could climb up a wall that you should not have been able to and walk up above the map. There was a bit of animation stuttering and a lot of clipping too. None of this happened in the previous titles.\n\nI, personally, had no big problems using a keyboard and mouse and traversed the game seldom dying. Most of my deaths was me running off the map due to bad camera angles.\n\nThe game's length and abrubt end is the most disappointing part. I finished it in just over 6 hours. That is getting all the achievements while I slowly traversed the levels looking at every nook and crany there was. I love to look at these games at a detailed level. Most will probably finish it in 4 hours. You might think that would lead the story to be rushed. Quite the opposite, however. We literally got half of the story, and they leave you on a cliff-hanger. Plus, some of the levels had little to no story narration and acted mearly as transition levels. All the side missions literally had no story elements at all and acted is basic horde modes for those to unlock further levels. Of the 8 levels, the first 3 were to introduce each character and brought them into the story. Another 1 or 2 were transitions. That leads to 3 or 4 story missions, of which 1 specific level had the majority of the entire story.\n\nIt is really sad. I hope they make enough money to make another Trine. It is - hands down - the most beautiful series of games of all time. They have charming and entertaining stories, and I would hate to see it go away.\n\nThey even said that this cost them nearly $5.5 million to make and their original scope would have cost over $15 million. They could not afford to finish it and if they were a bigger developer or had more money, we would have seen an amazing game.

There are a total of four levels in which you control all characters, Three major where you control each individually, 6 minor for an individual character with four challenge arenas that aren't that challenging and the underwhelming boss battle. The ending screams DLC.\n\nOn the positive side; the music is great, the story book levels are really great and the graphics are pretty good. It was a decent attempt at transitioning a sidescroller platformer to a 3D plane and it works here and there.

This follows on the heels of Magicka 2 which, like Trine, felt underdeveloped.\n\n[Spoilers below]\n\nI've come to expect traditional fantasy tropes from Trine. So, like the past games, the characters aren't terribly original and the story's not horribly inspired. Visuals are great, the music is pretty much the same.\n\nUnlike the last two, the story goes through a detailed exposition, long enough to get you excited, then bam: you collect one piece of the Trine and you're done. You see the Trine's sister get consumed by some hellish fire -- too bad. Not like you're going to save her. Yet.\n\nThe developers are probably planning DLC. With a story ending that abruptly, that's the only way to make sense of it.\nHowever, I can find no news about the DLC. It's so disturbing that they released the game like this -- either too early, or intentionally early to bolster more sales -- that I'm not sure I'm going to buy the rest of the game.\n\nI could talk for hours about PC games at this point. Either they're low quality, Early Access/Never Finished glitch fests. Or they're Trine 3 and Magicka 2: truncated, lifeless, and possibly DLC cows.\n\nI hate this because I loved the prequels so much.

The whole concept sounded great and I was very excited to play the finished game.\n\nIn practice, the 3D works pretty well now (a lot of the negative reviews seem to be of the beta, before it was all sorted). It's a logical continuation of the 2.5D gameplay and the character's abilities have been adapted to work in a 3D environment very well (though it is worth noting that the change in controls that this necessitates is confusing at first). The graphics have been updated again and the lighting, backgrounds and environments in general are just as beautiful as in the first two.\n\nSo where does it fall down? Gameplay length. Making it 3D tripled the production budget, meaning that the gameplay itself had to be shorter - or the game cost more. Frozenbyte chose the former, and unfortunately, that means there's only about 4-6 hrs of gameplay, and it ends on a cliffhanger. This has attracted the ire of a lot of people, and admittedly disappointed me. Nevertheless, what there is is solid gameplay, and Frozenbyte have said they are open to continuing the series after they have reviewed all the criticism.\n\nSo...down to a 7/10 or so from me. Really solid gameplay and a great continuation of Trine 1 and 2.

You can freely walk back and forth and left and right, but the camera stays at a fixed point. It is as wanky as it sounds. Worst of all, there are no invis. walls at the end of the map. You can freely walljump onto backgroundwalls just to fall outside of the map and instantly die. If you could jump somewhere in T1/2 you'd be sure there to be secrets. Here it's just bad gamedesign that let's you basically wall jump EVERYWHERE.\n\nWith that the platforming is beyond junky. If you have to jump on a platfrom in the distant you never know if you jump slightly in front or behind it.\n\nTo the 3 heroes: They lost all their advanced abilities and skill trees. Only one box for the wizard, basic arrows for the rogue. The knight feels like a machine in comparison: Shield, charge, stomp, crush, push, you name it.

I really don't know. First, I would like to say, before you'll curse me how can I review a game after three hours (not counting 9 hours I got from Early Access), that I finished the game in co-op and completed all side missions (challanges).\n\nTake everything you loved in Trine 1 and Trine 2. Nice graphics, interesting gameplay, interesting and fairy story, funny dialogs, unique puzzles... Got it? Ok, now throw it away, because Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power offers none of that. Puzzles are either very easy, or very stupid it starts to frustrate you. Graphics? Somehwat nice, but Trine 1 is most of the time nicer and more interesting. Gameplay is depleted. From 2D to 3D gameplay was an interesting choice and change, but its execution is very bad. And I'm counting in the bugs, crazy physics, in fact zero RPG elements (Character development is non existent) and the story? b-u-l-l-s-h-i-t, really. Very strict, not interesting and unoriginal.\n\nThere are some interesting things, yes. Some interesting ideas, yes (6th chapter is particularry very nice - its art style to be precise), but otherwise? If you are fans of te series, keep your hands away from this. You'll finish this in three hours, collecting Trineangles (that replaced XP points) is pointless - except for unlocking new levels you'l unlock very easily anyway - and cooperation sometimes works and sometimes not. Judging by the open ending, I expect that creators will add some new chapters in DLCs (can't say if paid or free), but nontheles, the current state of Trine 3: Artifacts of Power is VERY, really bad and I do not recommend it even in sale. After near-perfect Trine 2, this is very big dissappointment that I do not reccommend even to fans of the series. Especially to them...\n\nEDIT: Just got 100% achievements (all levels competed, all Trineangles collected) - in 4 hours\n\n[CZE]\nTak, kde začít? Já opravdu nevím. Zprvu bych ale rád řekl, že než se začnete rozčilovat, jak si můžu dovolit tuhle hru „recenzovat” jenom po třech hodinách (nepočítám do toho 9 hodin co jsem nahrál v Early Access fázi), tak vás úpěnlivě ujišťuji, že jsem hru dohrál, v kooperaci, a splnil také vedlejší mise (výzvy). Za tři hodiny. Ano, TŘI hodiny. A ne, bohužel si nedělám srandu.\n\nVemte si všechno co jste milovali na prvním a druhém Trinu. Pěknou grafiku, zajímavou hratelnost, zajímavý a pohádkový příběh, vtipné dialogy, originální hádanky... Máte? Tak jo, teď to všechno zahoďte, protože Trine 3: The Artfacts of Power nenabízí vůbec nic z toho. Hádanky jsou buď naprosto jednoduché, nebo jsou tak šíleně pos**né, že vás začnou frustrovat. Grafika? Občas pěkná, ale i Trine 1 je leckdy hezčí a zajímavější. Hratelnost šíleně ochuzená. Přechod do 3D hratelnosti byl zajímavý a relativně funkční krok, ale jeho provedení je úplně mimo. Nepočítám do toho bugy, šílenou fyziku, vlastně nulové RPG prvky (postavy už nemají žádné dovednosti co si můžete vylepšovat). A ten příběh? Neskutečná kravina, opravdu. Napsáno suše, podáno stroze a celkově je to opravdu nezajímavé a neoriginální.\n\nObčas se objeví něco zajímavého, to hře nechám. Má občas pár zajímavých nápadů, (např. 5. kapitola je obzvlášť pěkná - především její výtvarný styl), ale jinak? Pokud jste fanoušky série, od tohohle se opravdu držet zatím dál. Dohrajete to za naprosto příšerné tři hodiny, sbírání Trineanglů (trojrozměrných trojuhelníků, které nahradily XP body) je úplně na nic, kromě odemykání dalších úrovní (všechny si stejně odemknete snadno), kooperace občas funguje a občas ne. Soudě dle otevřeného konce se dá očekávat, že tvůrci plánují přidávat další kapitoly. Netroufám si říct, jestli zdarma nebo ve formě placených DLC. Ale tak či onak je aktuálně Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power VELMI opravdu velmi bídnou hrou, kterou nedoporučuji ani ve slevě. Po perfektním druhém dílu jde o obrovské zklamání, které nedoporučuji ani fanouškům série. Resp. obzvlášť těm.\n\nEDIT: Zrovna jsem získal 100% achievementů (všechny levely splněný, všechny Trineangly sebraný) - za 4 hodiny.","August 20, 2015","false","14.8"," 209 of 332 people (63%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","63","209","332","8","11"

Trine 3 is the weakest game of all three but, just like the others, every single scenario is breath-takingly beautiful. The highly colorful and astonishing world of Trine is back!\n\nThe new aspect of Trine is the attempt to make the game 3D.  I can see the effort but sometimes it doesn't work. The distance perception is hard and maybe the game would work better if the camera was more of a top-down type, that way you could see the crate's location a little better.\n\nThe biggest shame of this is how the game is incomplete. You have to get parts of the artifact, and the game ends after collecting the first part. The boss was supposed to be one of the 3 or 4 bosses I think... It's so sad because I found the boss battle to be really fun and challenging, and the cutscene that follows, is a damn good tease!  I wish I could fight what's on this cutscene, but I don't wanna give any spoilers on my review.\n\nEnemy variety is pretty low, but that's something usual in the Trine games. The games have never been based on combat but more focused on puzzling and platforming, so that leaves about 5-6 different enemies for you to demolish. the combat although being in 3D now, is pretty much the same as previous games. Now here's one thing I highly miss...\n\nTHE SKILL TREE. WHERE IS IT? It was so satisfying collecting XP and buying that awesome skill that you were waiting for so long to get, but skills are nowhere to be found in this game. Amadeus is limited to one crate and no planks whatsoever. Zoya can't grapple everywhere but only on some  locations. The anti-gravitational, fire, or ice arrows are gone too. Pontius, although still having some abilities like the ground slamming and the shield hovering, does not have any skills to upgrade either. Remember that awesome fire sword you could get on Trine 2 that wiped enemies in a blink of an eye? Yeah me too, and it's not here either.\n\nAll negative points aside, I still loved Trine 3, because I just love how these games flow, the simple puzzles, the simple humor, the jaw-dropping visuals and the overall chemistry of the characters is something I've always enjoyed from Trine 1 to Trine 3. The level design is overall good, but in my opinion it seems that the game is easier than previous titles, maybe due to the new third dimension, it's easier to evade attacks from enemies, making the game easier overall.\n\nDespite the lack of skill tree, and the super short and inconclusive length of the story, Trine 3 is still worth the price if you're paying about 5-6 dollars or euros for it. I can only hope the game goes on story-wise, and we can actually finish this unfinished chapter in the Trine universe. 6/10\n\nPS: Remeber to rate the review either if you liked it or not, it really helps having some opinions! :)","February 6","true","5.7"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","41","52","0","2"

I am a huge fan of the Trine series and have played through 1 and 2 a couple of times with friends. They're among my favorite games of all time. And when I saw Trine 3 had a 3D component to it I was really excited, it seemed like a brilliant and logical progression to the series... but the execution is flawed.\n\nHaving no control over your camera feels extremely disorienting, often not being able to see your character. Navigating in the third dimension on a keyboard with a fixed camera angle felt really brutal. I imagine it's a little bit better with a controller though.\n\nSome of the changes to the controls were obviously necessary because of the 3D element, but things like drawing boxes were sorely missed. Amadeus went from being my favorite character to play in the first two Trine games to a character that felt almost unplayable because of how bizarre his controls are. Moving his boxes in the 3D environment (and to a lesser extent creating them) felt excessively difficult.\n\nThe puzzles I enjoyed in Trine 1 & 2 were complex and made me think about how to utilize all of the tools the characters have. In Trine 3 the difficult part of the puzzles felt like simply navigating the terrain and trying to overcome the cumbersome controls.\n\nThere were a few things I liked about the game though. The environments were stunning, and the 3D aspect only enhanced the beauty. Some of the scenes like Pontius floating through the 3D environment, or Zoya swinging along felt really awesome and were the few times I appreciated the added depth in the game.\nThe music was soothing and further contributed to a beautiful game as always.\nThe writing was quirky and amusing. Thumbs up.\n\nBut after about 80 minutes of trying to force ourselves to enjoy the game, my girlfriend and I put it down and are unlikely to play again. I'm really glad this series is still going, but this was not the Trine game I was looking for.\n","May 18, 2015","false","4.2"," 175 of 277 people (63%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","63","175","277","11","15"

I threw my money at this game because after purchasing both of the previous trine games plus the goblin menace expansion for myself, as well as many more copies for friends (some of which still sit in my inventory), I still do not feel like I have properly compensated Frozenbyte for the happiness that they have given me.

No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nVery few games actually feel like they are magic. In fact, the only games I have ever had a magical vibe from were from this series. Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power is the 3rd title in the Trine series, and is every bit as magical as its predecessors. A few shifts in its core design were made to make it a bit different from the other titles, but it's still a magical experience. An extremely beautiful 3D puzzle-platformer, Trine 3 absolutely shines in nearly all aspects.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nLike in the first two games, Trine 3 is a puzzle platformer, but the biggest change to the game is that it is now in full 3D. You can literally move in all 3 dimensions. Trine 3 focuses on three specific heroes: Pontius the Knight, Zoya the Thief, and Amadeus the Wizard. You are able to switch between all 3 heroes at anytime, allowing you to tackle any situation that presents itself. Each hero has their own unique abilities, which you have complete access to from the start of the game. This is something that was changed from Trine and Trine 2. Using their abilities in tandem, you will traverse wonderous environments on your quest for the Artifacts of Power to restore things to the way they should be so our heroes can go home and live their lives peacefully. Understanding each character's strengths and abilities is the key to playing the game, so I will be going over each of them in the next few sections.\n\nPontius the Knight is the first character you are introduced to. His abilities include being able to attack enemies with his sword, as well as a powerful charge attack with his shield raised high. This can be used to knock around objects in each stage. Using his shield, Pontius is able to reflect projectiles in any given direction, such as fireballs and rocks. This technique is great in certain portions of the game. He can also use his shield to slow his descent from a jump, allowing him to glide long distances, covering more ground than the other two characters. Lastly, Pontius is able to use his considerable size to perform a stomp attack, which dazes nearby foes and can be used in certain puzzles.\n\nZoya the Thief has a few special talents that make her absolutely vital to our band of heroes. First, she has a grappling hook, which can be used to latch onto many objects. Some such objects include rings placed in key locations, which Zoya can grapple from and swing between platforms, or other objects such as block which can be used in solving puzzles. She can also latch both ends of her rope to anchor the line--which I completely forgot you could do for quite awhile, and is a key point for a few puzzles! Zoya can also perform a dodge roll to avoid enemy attacks until you are able to get into a safer position to shoot them with her bow and arrows. One thing changed about Zoya is she now auto-aims her bow. You used to have to aim manually in previous games. You still can, however, but the game will automatically fire towards targets of interest.\n\nThe last character you can control is Amadeus the Wizard. Amadeus specilizes in conjuring arcane cubes that can be used as platforms to get to areas that are out of reach.  He can also hurl them at other objects or foes. Most objects in the environment can be picked up as well, and this actually serves as a key for some puzzles. When holding a cube or object you are able to rotate it and move it in any direction, which is useful for situating them for puzzle solving purposes.\n\nThe general gameplay of the game is simply amazing for a platformer. As you adventure through different environments, you simply switch to whichever character is best suited for the task at hand. A horde of monsters is coming your way? Pontius the Brave will make quick work of them with his sword. Giant gap to cross? Zoya will get you across with her grappling hook in no time. That button's out of reach? No problem, Amadeus can use an arcane cube as a platform to reach it. The key to the game is understanding each character's abilities, so familiarize yourself with them so that when you come upon certain puzzles, you are able to tackle them with no issues.\n\nScattered around each level are what's called "trineangles": small golden pyramids that are hidden everywhere. Collecting these unlocks extra playable chapters to further extend the game. Each stage has a set amount of them, and you are able to replay stages to find these hidden trineangles.\n\nCo-op is also available for you and up to 2 friends, each controller a character.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nI literally have no idea how they were able to improve Trine 2's graphic style for Trine 3, but they somehow pulled it off! This game is absolutely gorgeous. And I mean GORGEOUS. The overall look, the colors, the lights and shadows...everything looks outstanding. Trine has always been know as a series that looks very impressive, but Trine 3 takes the cake! If you look at this game and aren't impressed, then you have a serious problem that you need to get checked out.\n\nEach character has gotten a considerable upgrade to their model since Trine 2 and it shows in the game's various cutscenes. Everything is so vivid and colorful, which makes everything stand out. It's very difficult to miss many details in the game's environments when they all stand out due to looking so amazing. You will find yourself taking a lot of screenshots and simply admiring every environment you explore. From dark castles, to bright, lush forestland, Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. And this isn't something I ever say lightly.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nAnother great area of detail for Trine 3, the music is very upbeat and addicting. Bright, cheery tunes abound all over the game, even in some of the most perilous areas. When enemies appear the music shifts to a more serious tone, but once they are defeated it returns to normal. Great little detail, in my opinion.\n\nA sfar as the sound effects, everything is as it should be. Sword slashes, running, objects knocking together...all of it is spot on. I like how Amadeus' cubes sound when they pop into existence!\n\nPerformance\n==========\nLike a charm is how Trine 3 runs. The only issue I had was when first booting it up to play it took a couple of minutes to load, but after that it's smooth sailing. There is a short loading screen inbetween each area, but it is much shorter than the main menu loading.\n\nA controller is the way to go, honestly. But the keyboard controls work pretty well by default. I was just a lot more confortable with a controller, as the game requires some precise platformer in some stages.\n\nThe game ran at a smooth 60FPS most of the time, and aside from the menu screen loading there was no slowdown, stuttering, lag, or framerate drops. It ran as smooth as silk, which honestly surprised me considering how amazing the game looks.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nTrine 3: The Artifacts of Power is very much a worthy successor to the Trine series. If you enjoyed the first two titles, you pretty much have to play this one. It continues our three heroes' adventures and is an incredibly fun and balanced puzzle platformer. Not too easy, not too hard, Trine 3 will appeal to audiences of all ages. The only downside to it is that it's short, as it only requires a handful of hours to beat.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmoomR1wRw\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","September 3, 2015","true","8.2"," 86 of 136 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","86","136","4","6"

And that makes me truly sad.\n\nTrine and Trine 2 and all the expansions were masterpieces. But what they did with Trine 3 doesnt feel nice.\n\nThey basicly took every component from trine and striped it to its bare minimum just to implement 3D. And 3D makes the game worse in many ways. You often find yourself dying over and over again just because the camra blocks the view of the obvious solution. A bridge in the foreground maybe.\n\nI cant recommend this game. If you never played trine you are in for a fun time with trine and trine 2. If you allready played trine you will be dissapointed with this and what it has become. I hope they go back to the 2D roots with next one. I would love a good trine again. And it makes me so sad to say it.

The decision to implement full 3D has brought better environments at the cost of just about everything else. This is still a fun and easy to play adventure, but one that does not match the quality or intricacy of its predecessors. It does maintain the charm of the series but leaves players with a half-finished story. The platforming is enjoyable but slightly wonkier because of the 3D movement. Our three heroes are less capable because they have fewer abilities and this also means the gameplay is simpler. Trine 3 is still worth playing, but that additional dimension comes at a price.\n\nRead full review[www.newgamenetwork.com]","August 28, 2015","true","9.4"," 38 of 55 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","38","55","0","0"

I see something simple, pure, not complicated. You have a Wizard, Rogue, and Warrior. Standard troupe. You have a gorgeous fantasy setting and a standard puzzle/platformer genre. However Trine 3 and the series in general is much more then that. Each element from the music, puzzles, gorgeous painted backgrounds,  luminescent locales, are all treated with tender care and attention to detail. This is what rises the Trine series from the mundane to amazing.\nTrine 3 raises the bar again with new ideas and classic Trine gameplay. From swinging precariously over spikes, to shield bashing your foes. You will combine the powers of the three heroes to get through many physics based puzzles. However instead of the simple 2d from left to right. Trine 3 adds in new dimensions in multiple directions. Hiding secrets and making puzzles even more challenging. While this is just EARLY ACCESS and there is plenty more to come.(More Challenges, levels, Map editor, Mod Support)  The new way you move through the game just feels natural and right.  This and Frozenbytes stellar record as a developer. Makes me very excited for the future of Trine 3. Which is sure to be a fantastic sequel and elevate this series even more.\n\nI made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/UbZCHoFB_IQ\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","May 26, 2015","true","2.3"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","30","41","2","0"

Fans of the original Trine games' aesthetics shouldn't be disappointed.\n-Music, as always, is lovely.\n-Shield parachuting\n-More of a cinematic feel, overall. (Cutscenes, being able to see the characters' faces as they're talking, etc.)\n\nNegatives:\n-While the 3D-ness can be cool and produce that "wow" factor at times, I mostly found it to be a bit bothersome. It makes things like placing conjured boxes especially annoying. Mage conjures a box, and I need it slightly forward of where he is, and the only way to move it forward is to move my character forward. A bit of a pain, seeing as several times, this would cause me to fall off a ledge and have to start the business over again. Would be nice if devs could add an option to move boxes and the like forward/backward with mouse scroller (much like they did with Zoya's grappling).\n-The camera doesn't follow your character all the time. In 2D, this isn't a problem, because there's only two directions you can basically go. 3D, however, is much more disorienting when you have no control over the camera. It may be just me, but my depth perception was thrown way off because of this and it caused me to mess up quite a bit more than is usual for me.\n\n\nOverall, I had fun with my time in-game. The only things that annoyed me, or made the experience less enjoyable to me, stemmed from the 3D gameplay. Hopefully, I'll either get used to it, or the devs will be able to polish it up a bit before release.","April 21, 2015","true","1.8"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","30","41","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/319910/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","Trine and Trine 2: Goblin Menace are among my favorite games. They have gorgeous graphics, smooth gameplay with unique characters encompassing different skillsets, and very interesting puzzles making use of the physics engine. Without forgetting a great cooperative experience, local or online.\n\nSeeing how Trine and Trine 2 were such great games, I thought that Trine 3 would be a direct continuation and I would be enchanted once more. I was wrong. So wrong.\n\nThe culprit? Transition from a 2.5D game (3D game playing in 2D) to a 3D game with depth. Suddenly the controls went from smooth to clunky and too complex, and the fixed camera angles do not allow to correctly appreciate the distance of elements that are far away, leading to many unfair deaths. Many deaths including falling outside the bonds of the level. Like, getting too close to the camera and falling into the foreground.\n\nTo develop my gripe with the controls, I will give an example. WASD keys used to move the character left, right, down and jump. With the grappling hook, the thief would swing from left to right using A and D, and change the length of the cord with W and S. Now, W and S are used to move towards and away from the camera, so to move in the depth. Jump thus has to be on the space bar instead of W. The thief can still use her grappling hook (on very few surfaces bearing a ring, gone is the relative freedom of the previous entries), but W and S are used to swing towards and away from the camera. So now on top of the previous keys and the new key for jump, mousewheel up and down are used to change the length of the cord. This means that something which was very fluid with 4 inputs and one hand now requires 7 inputs and two hands. Same with the other actions such as swimming and using magic boxes with the wizard: everything is more annoying to use because of the 3D.\n\nAnd add to the madness of the controls the issues that come with depth perception. Am I aligned with the platform I want to jump on? I think so. I jump. I fall right behind it, instantly die in toxic water and have to start over the whole level. Yes start over, I will come back to those levels without checkpoints later. Overall the 3D perspective either obfuscates elements that should be plainly visible, such as a foreground with a passage only revealed if the character moves very close to the camera, or, as I said, does not clearly convey the distances, and a single slip of the W and S keys for depth can kill the player in a very unfair way. And the levels are contained within a bottomless abyss which is very easy to fall in while exploring or miscalculating a jump that seemed legitimate.\n\nJust these two complaints, clunky controls and depth issues, are the reason why I cannot recommend this game in good faith. I did not have fun playing most of the levels because of this. The only level I enjoyed a lot, the one taking place inside of a book, was the closest to a 2.5D Trine experience. Switching the game from 2.5D to 3D also increased the cost of making the game for the development team Frozenbyte, and it really looks like they had to release it as soon as possible. Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries had exactly the same problem, trying to have full 3D in the game skyrocketed the costs, and the development team GRIN had no more money to continue making the game. So 3D increases the cost, while reducing the enjoyment of the players... Not a great deal. In the event that Frozenbyte would still want to include 3D to the Trine series to spice it up, I recommend looking up games that did 3D platforming well, such as the Mario games, Rayman 3 or somewhat Alice Madness Returns. In any case, the camera should follow the character, not be locked in weird perspectives that make the platforming horrendous. Lastly, I would suggest looking at Crash Bandicoot that managed to mix 2D phases and a 2D feel to 3D phases. In any case, sticking to 2.5D is just fine.\n\nMy next complaint about the game is actually not about the length (or lack of experience points and a skill tree), unlike many players. It took me 8h for 100% and I wouldn't want more of this 3D mess. No, my complaint is about the way that the progression system was handled. Before even entering the Astral Academy I had unlocked side levels that were taking place in the academy... Overall the story felt completely disjointed, and the ending did not resolve ANY of the quests, making it feel like a botched up "woops, we're out of budget, let's stop here". Because of the Trineangles to collect in side levels to continue some of the main levels, the progression was not fluid at all.\n\nTalking about these side levels. They star one of the three characters alone, the way some of them (Knight) are introduced makes little sense with the rest of the story, and they have no checkpoints. Death means restarting. I am fine with some short bonus levels with an extra challenge, but having to suffer through the same clumsy physics puzzles over and over, just to get back to the part where I keep dying because the perspective messes my jumps, makes for an infuriating game experience.\n\nSo, is there something that I want to redeem from this game? Well Trine 3 is gorgeous, with some new beautiful levels to go through such as the shipwreck and the unique amazing level that takes place in the book and radically changes the art style for its duration. Also, the last boss fight was really nice.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not recommend Trine 3, it is clearly not as good as the other Trine games because of the inclusion of 3D and a camera angle not suitable to appreciate depth (survival horror games also dropped that system!). Even if it lacks a lot of polish I would not say that it is a catastrophic bad game, but it remains a problem that I had so little enjoyment in playing it. I still love the Trine series and hope for more of it, so I really hope that Frozenbyte will not have funding issues or drop Trine. Perhaps they could do a kickstarter if that is the case, as long as they convince me that they don't go for 3D or take a different approach than this one!","August 28, 2015","false","10.5"," 41 of 61 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","41","61","2","2"

That said, if you liked Trine 1 and 2, you will probably like 3 and the changes it introduced.\n\nLong of it:\nTrine 3 was, unfortunatly, released early due to budgeting issues. It is still a fairly well polished game however. There are 8 major levels, with a good mix of mini-challenge levels. Other than the first 3 tutorial levels, the main levels are pretty long. Story-wise, it feels as though this was intended to be the first third or fourth of the full story.

(Depending on the exact camera angle, it can be hard to tell if you are properly aligned with a platform). The 3D element was not overdone however, which is awesome.

Both in listening to the community and responding.\n\nOne example is that I had a question about the first version that was years ago and the Developer answered me on Steam in no-time. This goes also for others experience with the devs.\n\nThe devs also released support for Steam Workshop with all the in-game content with a great editor.\n\nTrine 1 came, was worried that Trine 2 would be a replay, but not at all, same goes for Trine 3 this is what makes Trine perfect. Sequels usually mess up games, but not this one.\n\nThere is not a single reason for not buying this game or even getting all three(strongly recommended)!\n\nDevelopers: 11/10\nGame in total: 11/10","June 29, 2015","true","1.5"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","27","38","0","1"

For me Trine 3 is the pinnacle of the series with the new fully 3D platform environments.\n\nSure it's shorter and no skill tree as per previous entries, but I enjoyed every bit of it and don't think the lack of a skill tree a big deal really. For me the beauty, fun puzzles, physics and new perspective on gameplay is still intact and everything I luv about the Trine series.\n\nIf you're worried about the length, maybe wait for a sale but I personally didn't find the game too short, it could've been longer but is long enough that I certainly don't feel shortchanged.","August 25, 2015","true","13.9"," 37 of 56 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","37","56","0","0"

Ok that was fast in comparison to other early access titles. Good job.\n\nHowever, downfall is, nothing of the bad things i mentionned below have been corrected or changed. The story is nice, the graphics just beautiful, but:\n- No Level Up\n- Little Content (for it's price)\n- You can run through levels very quickly without the need to grab or find all the stuff. It feels like missing a lot, but there is no gameplay benefit of it.\n- Dying a lot because of walking through things and falling down.\n\nCompared with T2 it's a thumbs down. But if i look at it stand alone it has still some uniqueness and the beauty of the game gets my attention. So if it's in sales, i still give it a close thumbs up.\n\n--- Review from April 2015 below ---\nThe game looks beautiful but has not much content yet and contains some major bugs. I think if you want to play with friends i would yet suggest to play Trine 2. If you want to test how the new look and feel of the game is, then i already give it a thumbs up to do so. The main change to Trine 2 is the 3rd dimension which most of the time gives more possibilities of interaction and solving of puzzles, but sometimes make things just more complex and complicated.\n\nGenerally i will mainly compare it with Trine 2 as i have played this a lot in co-op, please apologize:\n- Graphics look nice and similar to T2\n- Pontius looks and feels to play even better then in T2. He can fly now, run or fast jump into objects.\n- Zoya looks better and feels similar to play as in T2. I don't like to use the scroll of the mouse for the rope. This was better in T2. And yet i didn't recognize any new features of the character.\n- Amadeus looks worse and is more complicated to play yet. This was my favorite character to play with T2. So i hope that this will gonna change. For example currently you have to press F to generate an object when in T2 you were able to draw it in the air and it did appear.\n- The 3rd dimension feels great when flying through the air with Pontius. But i don't like it if i want to jump on an object and on my perspective it looks as i would stand right in front of the object but actually i dont. Or i run into the wrong direction because the camera position is always fixed.\n\nMajor bugs found after about 1h of play:\n- When playing Zoya i was able to walk through stone and falling through the map on several places but all near a fountain.\n- At the pirate ship a golden pyramid was falling out a barrel and into the nothing behind the ship, it disappeared and i couldn't get the item, so i will not be able to find and grab it\n\nI will keep playing Trine 2 because it is still more fun to play but i will follow the progress of Trine 3 and hope it will end up in a year or so as the great game it has the potential for but yet isn't.","April 25, 2015","true","3.0"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","23","31","2","0"

What can I say? This is a great adventure, and a worthy successor to the first two Trine games. The graphics are beautiful, the puzzles are challenging the the combat isn't too arduous. Overall I am enjoying the game, though I suspect I'd get more from it with a second player joining in. However the game is frustrating at times. The 3d perspective can be tricky to get the hang of, and the controls have strange glitches. For example, when Pontius jumps onto the ground to break objects or damage opponents, occasionally he will go charging off in a random direction when he hits the ground. While normally harmless, sometimes it means he goes sailing off into the abyss and dies! This is especially irritating on the bonus levels, when after 1 death you are sent back to the beginning. Developers, PLEASE, PLEASE! put some sort of checkpoint system in those levels! Yes they are short, but it gets incredibly frustrating doing the same bits of the puzzle over and over again so you can get those much-needed Trine-angles.\nI would recommend that you play through the tutorial levels more than once. I didn't get the hang of all the controls the first time round, so a second play-through was most beneficial. Plus that sheep is adorable! :3\nIn conclusion, if you enjoyed Trine 1 and 2, get this!

Trine series were always good looking to eye and has nice story. Sadly, Trine 3 has no imposive story which has an end nor hard and challenging puzzles.

The only feedback I can give at this point is (I know, it's early access) while it feels 3D (movement, environments), things like aiming the arrows and moving objects around the level are still done in 2D (the character can only aim/move objects left or right from where they are standing) which has led to some rather amusing deaths by spikes, pits, and other hazards, however I can (and have) easily mis-judged a jump and landed on empty air.\n\nDon't know if it's an early access thing, or an added level of challenge - either way it won't keep me from enjoying what is without a doubt a suitable 3rd entry in the Trine series!\n\nTL;DR:\nBeautiful game on a current-gen graphics card (settings maxed).

This is the first thing I want people to understand.\nThe game takes what the Trine series have already established, creative puzzles and level design, gorgeous graphics, and entertaining co-op gameplay, and then add in a new dimension, more specifically, the third dimension. Unlike it's predecessors, in Trine 3 you can move in and out of the background on all X, Y, and Z axis.\n\nThe additional dimension will evoke new  puzzle elements and a new way to think about puzzling and platforming. It's really hard to say if this is to the serie's benefit or detriment at this point simply because there's not enough of the game to really judge that quite yet. As mentioned before, Trine 3 is in early access, and as of this impression (v0.04 Build 2882) there's only the first 2 chapters, 2 challenge levels, and a sandbox map. There's only about 1.5 hours of gameplay, and because of the lack of content at the moment, it's very difficult to judge if the new dimension adds, or detract from the classic formula.\n\nWhat I can say from the brief amount of gameplay I've experienced, is that the presentation and aesthetics is top shelf quality, the controls feel responsive, the puzzles (so far) are satisfying with out being too frustrating, and it was a joy to play. I'd just like to see a lot more of it.\n\nFor fans of the Trine series, Trine 3 seem to be shaping up to be of a great quality, but once again, be aware there is VERY limited amount of content so far. The game also suffers from some optimization issues as well, but overall it's on the right path.\n\n$20 might be asking for a little much for what's currently available, but I would suggest at the very least, adding this to your watch list, and check it out again when it's in it's final release. It definitely is showing a lot of promise.\n\nPros:\n- Gorgeous aesthetics\n- Easy to learn\n- Creative puzzles and level design\n\nCons:\n- Not enough content currently (v0.04 Build 2882)\n- Needs optimization","May 5, 2015","true","2.2"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

This game is played best with friends, going slow and just taking it all in. (I can’t stress this enough: all the Trine games are significantly more enjoyable with friends.) Beautifully polished environments and hilarious and interesting gameplay make this game one of my favorite co-op games of all time. (The other Trine games are also on my list of favorite co-op games.)\nOn a different note, I see quite a few people also complaining about bugs. I have found a couple of spots in the map where hitboxes do not line up perfectly with the models, but I didn’t find any game breaking bugs in my playthrough.\nAdditionally, I also see quite a few people complaining about the lack of abilities in this game that were present in Trine 2. I feel a lot of those abilities would not work very well in 3D, but I agree that it would have been cool to see a larger variety of abilities in this game. That being said, the game was still fun and interesting without a larger variety of abilities.\n\nHowever, I completely understand if you still don't want to spend $20 on a game that you can just rush through and beat in 4 hours; if that is the case, I highly recommend buying the first two Trine games if you haven't already done so. Both of them are fairly short (although longer than this game); but, they are both extraordinary games with cheap price tags (especially on sales.)","August 22, 2015","true","7.5"," 69 of 120 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","69","120","0","0"

If you look at the discussions here on steam, you will see that many complain about its length. I don't. The Trine series was never meant to be a series of lengthy games. It's meant to be casual fun for the casual gamer. And it is! Don't be silly and expect 20-50 hour gameplay. I see a lot of reviews by people who have finished the game in half the time I took and then give it a negative score. Why are you in such a hurry? My playthrough wasn't plagued by deaths or full level retries. When I was done with a level I took an extra ten minutes going over each area (not the full level) where I missed some Trineangles (yes, that's what they're called) and then moved on. The chalenge levels I all completed 100% on the first try. Why people feel the need to rush through games I will never understand.\n\nTrine 1 was great. Trine 2 added new mechanisms and, in my opinion, ended up being too fiddly, repetitive and tedious as you fought the physics engine more than the game. Trine 3 simplifies the experience and provides smooth progression (some say too easy). The levels are creative and enjoyable. New ideas are well implemented.\n\nFrozenbyte does a good job of balancing the characters and constructing puzzles that utilizes all character powers. Zoya still suffers a bit from being nerfed from the first game and Pontius is still a bit too powerful in combat after being buffed in the 2nd game. But I won't complain about that. They're all good and you'll need them all regularly to finish the game in singleplayer.\n\nThe new thing in Trine 3 is the departure from a 2D platformer to a 3D platformer. To be honest, I think it still feels like 2D but "enhanced" to the 3rd dimension by allowing depth movement of both characters and objects. You still don't controll the camera. It's still fixed as in the same way as the previous games. I think Frozenbyte did a great job evolving the game further in doing this. Thumbs up!\n\nAs others have mentioned, the character progression is gone. No skills to level up or abilities to unlock. This is the only thing I missed in this third installment. But I wasn't bothered by it considering how fun the game was from start to finish.\n\nAll in all a great sequel in the Trine series! I loved it!","August 23, 2015","true","8.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

I normally don't collect any collectibles or achievements, but as I read the reviews, people mentioned it was a short game so I decided to go for them this once. If you are an advanced player, you may be able to finish this game with 100% completion in 5-6 hours, which is the lowest I have seen so far.\n\nSo the game's short if you don't collect, as most of the puzzles are in collecting them. The game is well narrated as its predecessors and the graphics are stunning.\nThe music is a massage to your ears and changes with the atmosphere of the story.\nThe game has unbelieveable graphics, I would even dare to compare them to The Witcher 3 in a fantasy theme.\nConsidering the proficient visuals, the modeling was poor, but yet outstanding for an indie title.\nThe gameplay is easier than Trine 1 and 2, and unlike most people I believe the 3D was very well implemented. Room for improvement of course, but definitely not 'unbearable' as I have read in other people's reviews.\nCombat is well executed, it may be too easy to some, but I didn't mind the combat at all.\nI played the game with a gamepad and I had no problems with the controls at all.\n\nI got this game at a 75% discount and at the price of €5.50 I cannot downvote this game. I recommend this game whenever it's 50%+ off.\n\nLooking forward to the next adventure.

The change from 2D to 3D is what has the most impact on the game. I don't think it is always a great success (sometimes it's hard to see where you'll land) but for most parts it works really well and it gives you very different puzzles compared to the previous titles. One change that I don't like so much is that there are no more character upgrades and that all your characters have less abilities than the previous titles. I suspect this might be because they ran out of budget, which is also something that shows at the end of the game. The ending is so abrupt that it seems it had to be finished within a week.

Do I recommend it? Absolutely, it has 5 hours of co-op fun and an awesome fantasy-bursting story that ties into the first Trine game.\n\nSo what do I mean by "it's not a Trine game?" Well, it's barebones. There are no difficulty settings like the first two Trines, instead however hard it's supposed to be is as hard as it is, which isn't very hard at all. Every little enemy dies in 2 fully charged shots of Zoya's bow or in a few hits from Pontius' sword or one hit of Amadaeus' box - speaking of which the wizard now gets an attack. While useful in bad situations, it feels weird since the wizard was almost useless for combat in the last two Trines, except (again) in special situations. The larger enemies just fly around and cast spells at you until you hit them with Zoya about 6 or 8 times and they aren't a big threat either. There's also no health jars, instead you regenerate health automatically after a certain time of taking no damage.\n\nThere's a lack of collectibles. Throughout the game you'll find Trineangles, and that's it. Each major level (of which there are about 8) has 150 Trine angles, except for the final boss, and all the other little chapters have 25. What's disappointing is the only purpose to collect these Trineangles is to get enough to unlock the next chapter as your characters can't level up anymore. You won't be getting a fire sword, triple arrows, or the capability to place five boxes and two planks in this game. Also why do I have to collect Trineangles to unlock the next chapter? This is something to expect in a free phone game, not a paid for Indie (is Trine still indie?) game, much less Trine. If you ever have to go back to collect more Trine angles you don't have to finish the entire level again for the game to recognize you collected them. This is good because some levels are 30 minutes long.\n\nBack to the difficulty - there are checkpoints EVERYWHERE, and they make a ridiculous amount of noise. For the one or two puzzles I got stuck at it was really obnoxious hearing their sounds for the 5-10 minutes it took me to figure it out, but that's also a testament to the puzzles... They aren't that hard. In Trine 1 and 2 I still get stuck on a few of them, but I walked straight through 90% of Trine 3's.\n\nThe smaller chapters don't have checkpoints, and as a result are rather difficult sometimes. One with a big swirly platform mess took me 20 tries and had me raging, which was a good thing. I wouldn't want there to be checkpoints in those levels, it would ruin what difficulty it has.\n\nAlso, it's no longer a sidescroller, which makes some jumps harder than the puzzles themselves. It's hard to tell where you are on the ground, and where you're going to land, and I often found myself falling to my death. At least reviving dead people is easy, but you only get one per checkpoint which was never a problem with me. If someone required to finish a puzzle dies then that person will always be revived.\n\nDespite these Trine negatives, it's a good game. For $20 you get more time out of it than you do on a $60 Call of Duty single player, and the story goes much deeper into the history of the Trine and, as stated before, ties well into the first game. If you're a Trine fan then this is clearly a must buy, but don't expect a Trine game... expect a different Trine game.","August 24, 2015","true","5.2"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","2"

Because I really liked Trine 3. Despite being very different from the previous games in the series, Trine 3 still has the beauty and the soul I came to know and love. The gameplay has changed (pretty drastically), but that is not necessarily a bad thing. This is what I thought was positive, neutral, and negative;\n\nThe positive:\n\n- The storytelling. Now, it is true that the story in Trine 3 has an open ending (which I agree with other reviewers is a negative point). However, the part of the story that is told is told magnificently. The story of Trine 3 tackles the origin of the Trine and the other artifacts of power. Personally, I was completely engaged by the story, much more so than I was by the stories of Trine and Trine 2. I really hope there will be another game to finish the tale.\n- Visuals. The Trine games are all beautiful, this one being no exception. Everything is as colorful and fairytaleish as ever. I particularly loved the extra detail poured into the appearance of the three heroes. With each installment they've become more recognizable, which I consider a big plus. The first Trine was about a Thief, a Wizard and a Knight. Trine 3 is about Zoya, Amadeus and Pontius. Also, one level (I believe level 6) takes places within the pages of a book - rarely have I seen any part of a game that beautiful. Wow.\n- The music. There's really not much to say about this; it's amazing. The soundtrack was made by the same person who made the soundtracks of Trine and Trine 2, and he has yet again failed to disappoint.\n- The single character levels. In the main storyline levels of Trine 3, you can play as all three characters, just like in the previous games. However, Trine 3 also features plenty of non-story levels in which you only control one character. There are a few level focusing only on combat (most of which you play as Pontius, but also one as Amadeus) and each character has two mini-levels focused around that character alone. Pontius was separated from his companions, and his two levels focus on him getting back to them. Zoya's levels detail her search for the giant emerald she was chasing at the beginning of the game, and Amadeus takes a nap and goes on a quest for the elusive fireball spell in his dreams. I thought these levels were really quirky and fun.\n\nThe neutral:\n\n- The 3D. On one hand, it is a refreshing change from the first two Trine games. The extra dimension really adds to the puzzle aspects of the game, opening a whole new dimension (literally) of possibilities. On the other hand, the camera sometimes acts wonky and missing a platform and dying is very easy. The 3D is great for the puzzles, less great for the platforming.\n- The character's abilities. Like many other reviewers, I was sad to see the variety of hero-specific tools and powers diminished. Zoya no longer has any special arrows, Pontius has lost his hammer, and Amadeus can now only conjure one box at a time. However, there are some new abilities I really came to like. Zoya's rope (grappling hook) has become much more advanced. She can now tie both ends of the rope to two different objects, which is very helpful for solving puzzles. And, my favorite change, Amadeus is now actually useful in battle. I had tons of fun smashing boxes down on enemies, and he was actually my go-to combat character this time around.\n- Having to collect Trineangles (which were experience bottles in Trine and Trine 2) to unlock levels. As a collector and achievement hunter, I never even move on to another level until I'm sure I've collected everything in the previous level, but I can imagine other players being frustrated by this. If you do not have enough Trineangles to unlock the next level, you will have to replay a previous level to collect more. The Trineangles, however, are a lot less hard to find than experience bottles, so it should not take too long to collect enough.\n- There are a few minor bugs. Zoya glitches a bit when she has her bow drawn, sometimes you can phase though part of a wall, that sort of thing. I found nothing game-breaking, however, and the little bugs I found did not keep me from enjoying the game. I have read that there were some issues with multiplayer, but having only played solo, I cannot comment on them. Single player works like a charm, at least.\n\nThe negative:\n\n- The lack of challenge. In the first Trine game, there were a few achievements that took some extra effort, like getting through a level without taking any damage. Trine 2 was achievement galore, and I spent many hours chasing the final hard and frustrating, but satisfying achievements. Trine 3, however, is already a fairly easy game, and there are no achievements which require you to do anything particularly special - just complete the game and collect everything. I finished the game (and collected all achievements) in about 7.5 hours. Compared to Trine 2 (40 hours) and even the first Trine (13.5 hours), that is very little time. This is not because the game itself is too much shorter than the first two games, but because there is no extra challenge. I would have loved to see some achievements requiring you to finish the game on a hard difficulty, or even some of the wacky achievements from the first two games that force you to go out of your way to do silly things like making an enemy sail on an improvised raft.\n- The ending. It's been said by many others, and I can only confirm it. The game ends in the middle of the story, which makes it seem unfinished. From the forum I've understood that the developers planned on this from the beginning, but failed to inform their fans. Now, I did not buy Trine 3 immediately after its release, so I had time to read the reviews before purchasing the game and I knew what to expect from the ending. However, I can imagine that those who did buy the game right off the bat were bitterly disappointed by the lack of proper ending. So, if you want to buy Trine 3, do be noted that the ending is completely open and the fate of the heroes is left ambiguous.\n- There is no leveling. While I was neutral on the characters' abilities being mixed up, I was disappointed by the fact that all abilities are unlocked for every character from the start. The reward of unlocking extra powers for characters (rather than the much more tedious task of having to collect things to unlock levels) is, I think, what made many players chase collectibles happily. Now the collecting has become a chore, as the awesome reward of new abilities has been replaced by the unlocking of levels - which I believe we are already entitled to, as we bought the game, and therefore doesn't feel like a reward at all.\n\nSo, in conclusion, Trine 3 is indeed very different from Trine and Trine 2, and fans of the previous games are not by default guaranteed to like this one. However, in my opinion, different is not the same as worse in this case. Trine 3 is still a beautiful, quirky game with a lovely story, great characters and wonderful music.

Trine 3 is a disaster. In short:\n\n+ Very nice graphics.\n+ Fantastic story.\n\n- Full of bugs of any kind (wall and object glitches, broken doors , buggy bossfights, ...)\n- 3D game principle is almost impossible to play (controlling characters is too vague and confusing)\n- No more skills (yup, that means no ice arrows, no planks ect) the characters start with some "new" skills but they lack "old" skills and there is no way to learn new skills (so no leveling up in general!)\n- Levels are too easy! there are almost no passages which require teamwork!\n- Collecting pyramids unlocks new levels (which means if you do not have enough of them you have to play an old level AGAIN to collect some more before you can move forward to the next level!!)\n- The game ends right in the middle of the story... and it is not even an "open ending" or something. The wizzard just says "Great now we only need two more [...] to repair the [...]" [spoiler ^^] and then you see the credits\n\nResult:\nGame is super frustrating thanks to all the bugs, very short and ends in the middle of the story!

You don't have to play the first two to enjoy the third one. Also, local multiplayer is an option!\n\nThe upsides: The graphics are stunningly beautiful. The co-op works great, and the puzzles are well designed. Some of the bonus levels are quite challenging. The story is also interesting, and the dialog is witty; you'll smile and laugh often as the characters interact. A huge improvement over the previous installments is that the level select screen gives you hints as to where the missing collectable 'Trineangles' are in the levels. This really increased replayablility, and decreased frustration.\n\nThe downsides: Frozenbyte was only able to complete the first half of the game, so it ends abruptly at a cliffhanger. They did say they would produce the rest when they had enough in their budget to finish the game. Occasionally, the 3d is difficult to navigate, and occasionally there are bugs - every once in awhile the 'trineangles' would only collect for one person in multiplayer. This wasn't a major issue, more a minor annoyance.\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend this game.

For starters, many bugs have already been fixed (at the time of this review). The only serious bug I've experienced is an issue with multiplayers and trineangles not syncronizing between players correctly. Other than that, the "physics bugs" people complain immensouely about are, in my opinion, funny. They actually add a bit of character to the game and leads to some unique and interesting gameplay. I wouldn't call it lazy, but just some interesting side-effects with physics in game worlds.\n\nAs far as the story goes, it's pretty good. A lot of the complaints say that the game is "incomplete". I guess these people didn't also read the lore tomes and listened to the cutscenes in the game, otherwise you would have known that there were 3 shard artifacts, one of which is found in this game, and the other 2 are for later versions of the game. I'm pretty sure it's been confirmed somewhere that the game has 3 parts.\n\nEverything else - audio, visuals/art, gameplay, is top-notch. I have no complaints. The art style is phenomnel and was blown away in certain areas of the game.\n\nGive this game a try and play it with friends.

The dev team clearly ran out of budget at some point and/or bit more than they could chew.\n\nThe game looks pretty and shiny, but the style just doesn't work as well in a 3D plane; the environments, while breathtaking, feel messy, cramped, and I'm often left wondering what's in the foreground and what's in the background, leading me to misjudge the depth of a jump and die more times than I'd care to admit.\n\nLevel progression is completely non-existent in this installment, consequently, there's practically zero motivation to go around getting all the collectibles like there was in the previous games. Characters have been streamlined, retaining their basic starting skills but missing the extra abilities that made it possible and fun to improvise around the different puzzles that the game threw at you.\n\nPerhaps the most disappointing aspect about this whole thing is the way they handled the story; the game ends right when the first act would usually wrap up in a traditional three act narrative. It comes out of nowhere, goes nowhere, and not much gets explained. Even as someone who didn't care much for how the plot panned out, it was very jarring to see.\n\nOther complaints include horrible lip syncing (no seriously, their mouths would start moving literally 30 seconds before anything was said), ugly character models (Zoya looks like she's been tweaking out with her eyes bulging out all the time and Pontius' model is way too realistically modeled to fit the style), and way too many bugs to even begin to list (luckily, none have been game breaking for me). Ironically, the bugs are what made this enjoyable to play, so I don't know if more QA would've made this better or worse to go through. With two friends tagging along, it was hilarious to see all the ways this fell apart as we tried to cheese our way through the puzzles.\n\nIf you're looking at this and thinking about buying it, play Trine 1 and 2 first. If you have and want more, buy this one only if it's on sale and you have people to suffer through it with you.","April 13","false","18.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It's extremely difficult to judge the depth of where you are, making some of the platforming needlessly frustrating. A lot of the fun skills have been removed, and collecting everything just seems like a waste of time. The game is too short and the story ends on a completely unsatisfying note.

Like always, they did a great job with the look of the game. Could be rose colored glasses, but I thought the prior two had more variety in their puzzles. I'm not sure what group Trine 3 is trying to appeal to. The puzzles don't require much thought, you don't need real strong timing or twitch skills, and the story really isn't a reason to play.\n\nI guess maybe I answered my own question. This seems geared for a casual platformer player (which is fine). I liked the first 2 quite a bit, maybe because they were fresher to me. I didn't remember as much fighting in the first 2 and the fighting in Trine 3 was pretty bad. The controls for the wizard's levitate ability was awkward fairly often.

They both succeeded and failed, but the game itself is still fun to play, though below the standard that the previous iterations offered.\n\nThey took away the upgrades that you could get for each of the magician, fighter and thief.  Now you the magician can only create one box at a time, the thief can use the grappling hook and arrows like before, and the fighter can charge and use his shield to block.  This simplifies the gameplay in comparison to the previous games, but it still doesn't take away from the fact the game is fun, especially in multiplayer.\n\nThe addition of a true 3D world where you can move left to right as well as into the depths of the gameplay add some interesting features and gameplay environments.  I read some reviews complaining about not being to tell the exact depth of the graphics, and I agree there were some issues about that, but none that I felt I couldn't learn and deal with properly and move on in the game.  The graphics were just as good if not better than the previous games and this is something that Frozenbyte is known for and they didn't fail at all.\n\nThe game is short and does end abruptly, at least compared to the previous games.  However, if I look at Trine 3 all on its own, I must recommend playing this game.  The simplicity of the multiplayer helps make the game smoother than Trine 2, but less challenging.  I would have preferred to see the challenge still there, but all in all I enjoyed playing the game.  Speaking of less of a challenge, you can notice this by looking at how easy the achievements are compared to the previous games.  I know it sounds like I'm saying many cons rather than the positives, but Trine 1 and Trine 2 were such stellar game experiences, that it's rough when you compare them.

So for me I only have 2 hours at the time of this review, and that will grow until I complete the game, but in the singleplay I don't see any of the complaints that a lot of other people are having. So far I have ran into minimal glitches, and the puzzels are just as deep as in Trine 2. I also see the other people say the story ends abrudtly, which I have yet to figure out for myself, but so far the story, within only 2 hours has kept me interested. The graphics in this game as per usual are amazing, and playing on my crappy laptop, only on the very low settings it still looks stunning, with the normal enchanting Trine styled landscapes and colors bringing you to a very fantasy like place. The movement is this game is also very smooth. When I saw that they were moving away from the 2D platforming that they did in Trine 1 and 2, I was skeptical, first off because I didn't see a reason for them to change it, but when I hopped in and started playing, it still had the classic Trine feeling to me.\n\nIn short: According to others, the multiplayer is bad, but I have found the single player to be enjoyable\n\nThe story so far has been compelling and interesting\n\nThe graphics, and game design are great\n\nMinimal bugs, (I have only ran into two which I'd say is pretty average, and they weren't game breaking or anything)\n\nThere is Smooth and enjoyable movment\n\nOver all I think that this game doesn't deserve the bad stigma that many other people are giving it, so don't let other reviews throw you off too too much!\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAs much as I wanted to like this game I can't give it a solid recommendation after completing it. Over all this game left me feeling super empty. So the game bassically is made of 3 different styles, one where you are at a wizard castle, in a book with very bland colors, a snowy forest and  a generic boss fight stage. The rest of the game is made up of a few side quests, that you MUST do to progress through the main story.\n\nNow that isn't my main complaint. My problem is that there just isn't enough. The game leaves you off where it shouldn't and to me it looks likes the developers tried to get more rmoney by not making this a complete game. The game leaves of to set up a sequel where there shouldn't be one is what im basically saying. Now this annoys me a lot. The trine games normally have great story but then when you come to this game is very, and I mean very lack luster. It started out interesting and then it turned out to be a thrown togethor mess.\n\nNow another problem I had with this game as comming back after finishing it is that it had Zoya as a very and I mean VERY usless character. She had no part in the boss level and in most other levels she was just a swing around little thing, which is a shame beacuse in Trine 2 she was a lot of fun to play with.\n\nNow the last part that urked me is the lack of boss levels, and how the game lead into them. The game seemed to just throw them in as an after thought instead of actually making it flow through the game. In trine 2 you are walking through a forest and then you seemlesly walk into a boss that I didn't expect, but in this game you have to load a new level and it is very predictable if you have half a brain.\n\nSo with all of this in factor as well as the first review, I am going to be neutral on this game. I would only suggest buying it on a large sale or if you are a super mega fan and just can't keep your hands off this series. Although I can't actually not give a up or down so im going to just keep it as an up!","April 8","true","6.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Common themes found in Trine games are: fantasy graphics and locations, story book tale telling, and puzzles.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: Once again our Hero's Zolya, Amadeus, and Pontius are brought together to assist the Trine (A magical Artifact the three hero's have gained power from) in yet another adventure. However, this time the Hero's are growing weary of always helping the Trine and they are starting to become quite discontent.\nThis results in the most uncalled for over reaction I've ever seen anyone have, let alone an animated object that look like a trophy-cup with a ball on it.\n\nGame Play:\nSo what's different?\nThe biggest change in Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power, is that Trine3 is in 3D. By that, I mean the game is played in a 3D plane unlike the past games which are played on a 2D plane and emulate classic side-scrolling gameplay, but with fancy fantasy graphics.\n(My opinion: I'm double minded on how I feel about this game change; I both love it, and dislike it - I really love the classic 2D Trine... but I adjusted to the 3D change quite quickly. However, there are many inevitable deaths because it's difficult trying to tell where  a floating block is without a shadow. I could forgive these deaths because there's barely any consequence from dying.)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=550958478\n\nThere is now a "World Map" that you can select the level/zone you want to play, with the addition of the world map there are side mission which you can do to unlock more story missions (if you miss any of the shiny triangles in the main story levels/zones, you will need the side missions to progress.)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552136200\n\nThe characters have new abilities or changes to past abilities. As in past Trine Games you switch between three characters: Zolya, Amadeus, and Pontius. To help you remember these different characters I've taken the liberty of giving them nicknames.\nZolya (Aka "Assassin's Creed Woman") can use a grappling hook, and shoot arrows. Unfortunately her skills have been severely downgraded from past games, she can only grapple hook on specific environment objects. (in the past games she could hook on pretty much anything above her)\nAmadeus (Aka "The Boxer"), he too, has been downgraded from his past skills. Now he can only conjure boxes and move most objects you see on the screen. In past games Amadeus could create platforms as well, but Trine 3 has given Amadeus a new ability! He can now smash his enemies with boxes, which is quite hilarious and very fun to do.\nPontius (aka "Meat Shield"), I'm happy to report I haven't changed what I use Pontius for since the previous two Trine games: I switch to him for combat, or if I need to walk through some spikes. He has lost his magnet shield ability, but now he can ground pound.\n\nAll in all, some of these changes are a game-breaking to some people, others get turned off by the random glitches that occur to the physics (I break stuff in every game I play, so I don't even notice, I just find a new way to solve the puzzle in Trine).\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=550958475\n\nAchievements: There are two kinds of achievements right now: Beat the level achievements, and collect all the things achievements. I have little doubt there will be more achievements added to the game later on.\nThe past two games had much more difficult achievements and achievements based on the character you're playing. specific actions within the story, completing the game on the hardest difficulty (which this game doesn't have, by the way; there's no difficulty selection.)\n\nPrice Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power is priced at $21.99. I judge games by how much they cost verse how much time I spent playing the game, I only spent 6 hours playing Trine 3. After those 6 hours I had all the achievements unlocked. (For the record, Trine 1 has 13 hours and Trine 2 has 30 hours. So you can see the previous two installments had much longer stories.)\n\nConclusion: To quickly recap, Story: enjoyable, I always love Trine's story telling style. Gameplay: This will make or break your feelings for the game. Achievements: At this time, Trine 3 is an easy 100% completion, I would be shocked if that didn't change in an update eventually. Price: Too high, but it was extremely good quality and fun to play.\nYou can tell the designers focused most of their attention of making Trine 3 3D (I no longer think Trine 3, being 3D is a coincidence... har har har.), unfortunately with the high emphasis on 3D levels/zones, it looks like the story, puzzle complexity and length of the game was severely cut back.\nI recommend this game to people who enjoyed the Trine series for their style and story telling aspect. If you really liked the puzzles or any of the "perks" systems in the old games, this game will disappoint you.\nFor anyone who hasn't played a Trine Game yet... I suggest trying out Trine Enchanted Edition, and/or Trine 2: Complete Story. While it's not needed to understand the story in Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power... you will experience a far more 'complete' game in the previous installments.\nThanks for reading my review!\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update November 15, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for Trine\nHere's the URL to see my review for Trine 2","November 15, 2015","true","6.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/319910/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","God, this must be how Star Wars fans felt when Episode 1 came out, incredible improved graphics and a rich detailed world stripped of most of its fun and charm. Like so many of us, I loved Trine, and when Trine 2 came out it brought improved graphics, a longer main gameplay and story and some fantastic multiplayer/co-op additions which all added to the original formula and gave more value to me. So why oh why would you want to throw all your money at the styling and art only to ditch the core values that made the first two games so successful Frozenbyte? Yes, the 3D is an interesting addition and the graphical improvements and design have not gone unnoticed, but when they result in emptying out all the challenge, cutting the playtime in half and doubling the price, you have know you're making a bad choice somewhere in development.\n\nHighlights\nIt feels as though the majority of Trine 3s' development has been focused around the new 3D Engine and the graphical artefacts and objects therein and at least to a small degree, it's paid off. It's fantastic to traverse a world where the same intricate level of detail from the first two games has remained, and due to the textures, resolutions, and most of all the lighting effects, the world and environments look even better. There's been a lot of time and effort spent on making most of the objects and art interactable or responsive in some way, and the world (though probably not the story and characters) truly feels a little more immersive than in the prior 2 titles.\n\nThe other thing that I really liked was the side objectives, though I felt due to the short length of the game they'd been forced into main content (you actively need to complete them to progress with the story now) which is a shame, but doesn't stop them from being great side-stories and fun in their own ways. They even have jokes and references to other games and they helped break up some of the issues the game has.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nThe single biggest player complaint on this title is the short length and/or the unfinished story/abrupt ending. While I felt the levels themselves were too short, there were more than enough of them to make up a full game here and it honestly doesn't feel that much shorter than the first title, especially considering the love and attention that has been put into making them so beautiful to look at, I think we've just been spoiled from the length and amount of content put into the second title. However, as Frozenbyte have confirmed, they simply ran out of funding and released what they had with a rather short, flat and emotionless ending, which truly is a shame when the happy comradery and whimsicle story were the fun backdrop upon the last two titles shone. Ultimately the gameplay and game itself are what count most and the ending with the comparatively short 5 hour play-time aren't what bother me most since 5 hours of a good title is, in my experience, worth more than 10 hours of a less enjoyable title. Instead it's the other failings and choices that make me very concerned and cautious about recommending Trine 3 and so ultimately the price is my single biggest complaint. Twice the price of the other titles when it's the least challenging, least engaging and most buggy of the three is simply an outright joke.\n\nThe 3D Engine is the cause of a few of those problems, particularly the lack of precision and accuracy seen in the prior two games. It a regular thing to jump past an area or over a platform only to fall or die because the controls or leap felt impinged by the engine, and even more annoying when it happens because you can't see what's around the corner. This has clearly been addressed somewhat by removing some of the challenge and slowing down the game a little, which I would normally be fine with, but when it's overdone so far as that it makes the entire game unchallenging, removes the progression system where you can unlock new skills and abilities and simply replaces them with collectibles, it feels cheap, flat, bland and worst of all, boring.\n\nRecommendations\nCurrently available on the Steam store for £31.99/44.99€/$44.99, Trine 3 is flat out overpriced. It's not a bad game, and while it lacks the challenge, complexity and some of the fun of the first two, it definitely still has a great world and environment to explore if you keep your expectations on level, but given the lack of improvement and the large price it just isn't worth the cost for most of us. If you want to pick it up, do yourself a favour and wait until it's less than the price you got the prior two titles, as that's the only price at which I'm comfortable recommending it to most, especially when you take into account that the developer have mentioned the story and game will not be updated or extended in the future.\n\nAt the time of writing this title is also available in the Trinology which is incredible value, especially on sale, and the Frozenbyte Collection 2015 which includes the whole of the Trinology and the two Shadowgrounds titles for an extra buck and change. As always, Trine 3 has a good multi-pack option and you can save another buck or two if you find friends to split with.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/319910/\n\nUnedited review notes 25/11/2015 for Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power:\n\n-Price is enormous, more than 2 times the cost of the original game, so it'd better be twice as good\n-It isn't twice as good\n-It's considerably worse\n+3D is genuinely fun to play with. Stopping and exploring adds a bit of time and fun to the ultra short levels\n-3D removes the precision and speed that are required to make this a challenging puzzle platformer and adds frustrations\n+Interacting with more on screen elements is a small thing but neat\n+Level select map screen doesn't add much but is nice and more story immersive which is a plus and slightly missing from the prior 2 titles\n-Levels are far too short, just when you get into a rhythm you get pulled out\n-+Characters/story/writing/humour aren't as good as the previous titles, though arguably it's only marginally lesser than the second title\n-Not challenging whatsoever. This was a problem in Trine 2 but not nearly as bad as it is here.\n-Many puzzles aren't obvious and can't be worked out other than by chance of messing around with everything on screen. I "accidentally" solved a few puzzles without having any clue what I was supposed to actually do.\n-Small annoyances like no artefact count per level, so if you've missed an artefact you'll need to replay the entire section, but it doesn't tell you once you've completed a section either, ridiculous.","November 26, 2015","true","9.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

The controls are not good and feel like a struggle. You have no control over the camera so it's sometimes hard to judge how deep a platform is, I managed to miss a platform over 5 times because I just couldn't tell how far from the camera it was. No more skills. You collect 'pyramids' throughout the game, which unlock new levels. So I got in a position where to play the next level I either had to finish several challenges that I didn't like because of the controls, or replay previous levels to collect more pyramids. I'd much prefer a shorter game that would allow me to play all levels one after another over padding it out with this kind of system. That's why I didn't even finish the game.\nTo its defense, tha graphics are incredibly nice and recognizable as a Trine game. Also, when you want to replay a level to collect more pyramids, you can choose from any sub-parts that even tell you how much stuff in them you've collected.\nI'm really sad about this game. Trine 1 and 2 wanted me to play more, and to press on when I got stuck, Trine 3 just makes me look for excuses not to launch it any more. 2 silver sloths.\n\n","April 5","false","7.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

The added 3D layer changes gameplay quite a bit and the fixed camera makes it very hard to determine where you need to jump at times, resulting in many unnecessary deaths. Camera controls would help immensely and should definitely be in a game like this.\nIt is still enjoyable once you've gotten the hang of thing, but that can take a while  - and unfortunately the game is not very long. I completed it in about 6 hours, collecting everything and getting all achievements. The brevity wouldn't be an issue, but since the story is ending very abruptly and it wasn't known prior to release that Trine 3 would end in a cliffhanger, it's a bit disgruntling.\n\nHOWEVER - Albeit these criticisms, the biggest being the fixed camera, I still recommend it if you like platformers, are okay with the price tag and don't mind cliffhanger endings. It's still a good game.","September 2, 2015","true","12.5"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","13","21","0","0"

Attempting to avoid a spoiler, one section has simulated paper... It is inspired; I hope to see this again in the future.\nI enjoyed the 3D environment. Despite being an 'on-a-rail' type of game, there is enough freedom to explore. You can take a break to look around and appreciate the view. You can't get the camera to show every location your player can reach, such as behind buildings, but there is nothing hidden there so it doesn't really matter. You can walk of cliffs and die. So try to avoid it (like in real life). One minor complaint is in multiplayer, when a player dies, the 'ghost' of the player sometimes levitates to a location ahead of the other players, so you might have to wait a bit before another player can reach your ghost to resurrect it.\nYou can map the commands to the buttons and keys of your choice, which I always appreciate since I don't use the standard WASD mapping.\nUsing PC keyboard and mice it took my group a few tries to defeat the end game boss. I think a controller would have been easier, especially for jumping in non-cardinal directions. But even one younger player who is typically easily frustrated, didn't even think of giving up. I expect we will replay this again, like we did Trine 1 and 2.\n\nNote to Frozenbyte: You can't please everybody. You took a risk to go to 3D. You learned from it. I hope you don't give up on 3D because I enjoy it and I think you did it right. I bought three copies at full price and we weren't disappointed. If you try again with Kickstarter, I'll be there. Hopefully you'll get enough cash to work out more bugs and avoid some of the negative reviews. Some people complained they didn't like some of the voice acting.

Devs were short on money, so they just decided to cut the game in the middle of the story. I didn't care for a story in first Trine even though I am a story guy, however in this game the story was intriguing, but sadly it will stay unfinished. But, I still think that this is a good game, and I enjoyed this more than first Trine at least(didn't play second yet). 3D is way more interesting in my opinion. In this game like before  you control 3 characters. Wizard, knight and archer. Every one of them has 2 abilities. Platforming is pretty fun, but the combat is meh. Puzzles in this game like in previous games are mostly easy, however there were 1-2 that were kinda hard. There are no any skill upgrades in this game(there were in first 2 games, but it's a bit rushed game, however I didn't mind this). Controls are fine even though some people complain, and I didn't encounter any bugs. Even though the game is rushed, fortunately it's very good otpimized like all games in the series. Graphic wise is more stunning than the first 2 games, and maybe the most beautiful game I've played so far. And like previous Trine games it also has a great atmosphere and the music. Game is about 5-7 hours long. It personally took me 7 hours to beat the game and get all achievements, since I needed to replay some levels so I can get all collectibles which are required so you can progress to the next level(you don't need them all at the beginning, but at the end for last few levels you will). Basically if you finish this game you're going to have at least 23-24 of 28 achievements that the game have.\n\nVerdict: Nice platforming, beautiful visuals, mediocre combat, great atmosphere and the music. Well optimized. Shorter than first 2 Trine games, but in 3D which I found better for this series at least. There are no more skill upgrades, and the game's story is unfinished. I don't think that this is worth the full price, but it's definitely worth getting with 75-80%+ discount.\n\nPersonal rating: 7.5/10","March 23","true","7.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Great level design, beatiful graphics and music. The big change from the Trine/Trine 2 was the 3D and changed abilities of all characters. Thieves hook is very often used in puzzles to connect certain objects. Wizards planks were removed and now he can only have 1 box at once but he has something like a slam ability with his boxes. They changed the knights melee combat animation but it's the same LMB spamming thing like before but it looks like he parries an enemy attack and then hits them instead of just swinging wildly. The "ledge-grab" mechanic has been changed from spamming the jump key near a ledge to just holding it down. Level design is just awesome and a new sense of exploration because of the 3D. I haven't tried the co-op yet ( I have no friends who play Trine III :-C ). I highly recommend buying this game if you liked Trine and Trine 2.\nAnd I'll add that this game has AWESOME game developers. They answer to all the questions on the forums pretty much in the 12-24 hours and keep the community in the loop and the steam workshop is awesmoe.\n\n10/10\n\nAFTER RELEASE\n\nWell I was hoping there were more levels, but no matter. The best thing they added is when you restart a level ( to get the rest of the collectables that you didn't get ) you can select a part of the level. That's huge. They added more challenge levels that are challenging at first but after you beat them once you can pretty much do them eyes closed. I was expecting more levels but whatever. I'm sure there will be Trine 4 or DLC.\n\nP.S.

Although only in early access the game already shows the promising polish of a great game in the making that is true to its predecessors in its fairy tale story telling of a magical whimsical setting and the characters are as lovable as ever. Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power does all the previous games justice with its respectful retention of the iconic art style and the amazing composer Ari Pulkkinen.

I've put off purchasing this due to the many "helpful" nagative reviews. However, it was half price, and I love the Trine series too much to pass it up.\n\nI wholeheartedly enjoyed this game.\n\nThe graphics are as lovely as it's predecessors'. The gameplay is smooth. The story is on par with the series. The collectables are fun to collect. I feel cool when I do cool stuff.\n\nTo address the common critiques.\n-The game is short.\nYeah it is. I started it yesterday afternoon and finished it this morning. However... I could play through the previous Trines in that time as well... You know what you're in for. At the $12 I paid for it... well worth it! At $24, maybe a bit much. But now knowing how much I enjoyed it, I would tell past me to go ahead and buy it full price.\n-3D is weird. Graphics are glitchy. Controls are hard.\nMaybe. Rarely. Not really. The 3D looks lovely. Do I think it really adds anything? No. I think most of the levels could be easily redone as sidescrollers. But at the same time, the game rarely forces you into a super 3D enviroment. I would describe it as a sidescroller with a bit of depth here and there. Glitches? Only when I tried to climb the background scenery I had no reason to climb. I had almost no issues/glitches during any critical gameplay. The controls were fine. Once in a while, object depth combined with weird lighting shadows, made thigns a little unclear. However this was only a couple spots, and I'd like to think of them as learning moments in gameplay.\n-Ripoff ending\nIt's clearly chapter 1... and aparently money may keep us from the rest of the story... But I'd like to encourage you all to buy it and support the devs if you hope to see the rest.\n\nStuff I liked\n-3D has it's moments\nIt really adds to the previously monotonous combat. One more thing to pay attention to. The worlds are gorgeous. Object interaction is 3D is cool. While I would have been happy with another 2D Trine, I have no bad feeling about 3D after playing it trhough.\n-Combat is cool\nThe Knight finally has his moments in combat with all sorts of knockback. The Wizard is given a box smash attack which keeps him combat non-optimal, but not totally useless. The Rogue's attack is insanely well controlled for how difficult it must have been to program. Her range, the areas combat occurs, and the speed and movement of the minions strikes a good balance to keep you switching between characters.\n-Game looks so good.\nIn case I haven't already made it clear... This game was as stunning as the first two. Character models, level design, textures, effects... all lovely. The whole playthrough was lovely.\n\nMy point is... buy the game. By comparison to the first two, it's clear where people are pulling critism from, but viewed on it's own I think it's a great game. And I think most Trine players will appreciate the new experience.","November 7, 2015","true","7.2"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

As you can see, by my hours played. It doesn't take that long.. I played trine 2 and loved it. Always playing 3 man co-op, as did I this time. There is so much wrong with this game I'll try to put it all down, but I'm not sure I'll remember everything.\n\n1. Very short gameplay, looks like there will be DLC's to complete the game, as it is clearly incomplete judging by the story line.\n2. Zonya is competely useless. There are barely any things you can slingshot on. The mechanic feels clunky, and in comparison to Trine 2, hard to use and unrewarding. Zonya is the pontius of Trine 2, needs help at a lot puzzles, and when she doesn't she can just swing over with 0 problems just skipping everything. No explosive arrows. No freeze arrows. No invisibilty.\n3. Pontius is overpowered. Why, because his attacks our so fast he stun locks everything while murdering it fast. He can spam his ground stomp, stunlocking everything and making everyones screen shake uncontrolably (NOTE: Screen shake can NOT be turned off). And the most OP thing about Pontius is that he can go up any vertical wall. By spamming jump and glide, you can steadily move up anything that has a wall connected to it. No magnetism.\n4. Pontius doesn't even come close to the crazy OPness off the Mage. The mage can now walk while levitating his box. Meaning he can jump on the box, jump again, grab the floating box again and move it under his feet, jump again, etc. Also, pontius needed at least 1 wall, the mage can doesn't. He can launch himself up high in the air out of the screen, by simply standing on his boxes, jumping, and dragging the box fast upwards against himself. If there's nothing stopping you, can simply fly or reach anything with your 1 box. Can no longer spawn planks. No longer summons by making a box or plank shape (In my opion an very cool mechanic. Now deleted.)  no magnetism\nThis is not a bug by the looks of it, as you can now only spawn 1 box.\n5. They deleted the skill tree. Yes, the fun progression you got by collecting those orbs in Trine 2, and slowly earning your new skills. Gone. You start of with the same abilities you end with. Nothing new. Actualy less then Trine 2.\n6. Game is still full of bugs. Happended multiple times bridges start spazzing all over the place and disapearing. Falling through bridges or platforms. Teleporting after being hit by Mage box. Rope spazzes from Zonya. And lots and lots more.\n7. 3D sucks balls. This game isn't meant for it. Clearly isn't. And judging by the game, it feels like the developers agree and just released the game, so they would be done with it and can focus on Trine 4. You have barely any concept of perception, you tend to jump infront or behind platforms half of the time. The mouse scrolling to change the depth of your floating box as a mage feels bad. It makes the game look less beautiful then in 2D.\n8. The game is incomplete, and will most likely force you to by DLC's to complete the game. Which is just sponging us off for money, and that's all this game feels like right now.\n\n\nTL;DR Game takes 3-4 hours to complete. You can cheese everything with pontius and the mage. Full of Bugs. Game is incomplete. Zonya is close to useless compared to the other 2. 3D is not the way to go for Trine.\n\nI hope there will be a trine 4, as the first thing I'll do is replay Trine 2. I loved that game and still do, but this trash isn't worth a it's money, nor a second change for it's DLC. Please stop putting effort in this game and just start Trine 4 in 2D, so we can forget this ever happened.","August 22, 2015","false","3.5"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","3"

The mage can kill his unsuspecting friends moving objects inadvertently and conjure boxes in their faces, And the huntress can leave them all behind swinging from rope to rope.

It was an amazing experience, now, in 3D. During my gameplay I've experienced only 2 situations when I couldn't see my character which was fixed by moving a little or waiting for camera to reposition itself. Sometimes I couldn't hit the Trineangles because I wasn't sure where they exactly are in the 3D world but it took me only few attempts. Despite these facts I think the new 3D feature is really well-made and I didn't notice any serious problems with camera during my gameplay. First chapters are designed to learn you how to control your character and how to move within 3D world. The atmosphere is amazing. Graphics in the in the combination with soundtrack in the whole series is a masterpiece. There are a few new visual effects, new challenges where you have to use physics and a lot of ways how to solve problems. Terrible skill points system from Trine 2 is finally gone and possibilities for each one of the 3 characters are very clear, all 3 are needed. Individual challenges are something new because you have only one character (Amadeus/Pontius/Zoya) and you have to solve the problem without help from others. One thing I really didn't enjoy was chapter map (points system). I was missing 45 Trineangles so I had to play one big chapter again to collect more, also, I don't like if I need to choose which level I want to play, it should be clearly defined as progress in the story. Overall feeling from ~8 hours of gameplay is really great and I would recommend this game to every fan of the Trine series and also to every new player who likes Platformer/Indie genre.","December 31, 2015","true","7.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The graphics are hands-down gorgeous and the world around you feels authentic and well crafted. The levels are decent, however the puzzles are a bit lacking in complexity compared to the previous Trine games. The music score is pleasant to listen to, but it's not as definitive Trine 2's soundtrack. The fights were fairly straight forward and easy, however they did throw in some pretty cool new enemies. If you try to get every collectable, you can complete this game in under 10 hours. As far as bugs go, it seems like they have patched most of them out at this point. The only bugs I found were mostly visual and non-gamebreaking. The only serious bug I encountered was a visual bug of ghost collectables following me around, which was fixed easily with a reload of an autosave.\n\nPros:Beautiful graphics\nWell-crafted world\nVery scenic with so many vibrant colors\nGood story\nGood voice actingNeutral:Decent music score\nMediocre puzzles\nFights are relatively easy\nControls can be a bit difficult to get used because of the 3D, although the camera did a good job ajusting for different angles.\nAmadeus the Wizard can still make flying machines, but it's much harder now that he's limited to just one box and no platforms. However he can still fly with the combined powers of a spare box, Zoya's rope, and a little magicCons:Ends on a cliffhanger because the developer ran out of funding\nSlighty buggy, but usually only when you are trying to break something\nA lot of the old skills are gone, replaced by new ones that feel slightly underwhelming\nLeveling up to gain new abilities isn't a thing anymore, you just have abilities from the start\nA really lazy reference to Portal that they say twice in the same level for some unknown reasonOverall Score:7.7/10","January 11","true","10.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Very disappointing.\n\nThe first two games in the Trine series feel more challenging and the player feels rewarded, as there is some degree of character customization in that you are able to obtain trinkets and upgrade abilities. This aspect is completely absent from Trine 3 and is sorely missed, but what it lacks in challenge, it makes up for in beauty. In addition to the obvious graphics updates, Trine 3 upgrades the game series from 2D side-scroller to 3D "side-scroller". This makes the gameplay more interesting, though in a couple of levels (the "paper" levels), it unnecessarily adds to the difficulty of judging exactly where your character is jumping to. Although this caused me a minor headache at least once, most of the game is free from this being an issue.\n\nAccording to the developer, the jump from a 2D platform to a 3D platform made the game, essentially, three times the cost, so rather than committing financial suicide due to poor planning, they released 30% of a game. 20/20 hindsight.\n\nAlthough this game had its letdowns, I hope this isn't the end of the Trine series due to development issues, but I do hope future titles are capable of delivering longer gameplay and reintegrating the ability to obtain trinkets and upgrade abilities. The graphics were gorgeous, but to the detriment of more meaningful gameplay.","January 27","true","15.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's not perfect and a few complaints actually have merit, but nothing worthy of a "Mixed" review score. You'd think they were the WarZ developers with all the hostility floating around. The game could stand to be a bit cheaper or considerably longer, though.\n\nTo the average player, the first and second games were just short, neat adventures to play with a friend or two. The puzzles have never been brain melting or anything. This iteration is the same, except prettier and you move north and south sometimes. You also don't have unlockable skills like Trine 1 and 2. Which is fine, since a lot of them only existed because they were required to complete puzzles. An RPG mechanic that lightweight is not worth getting that worked up over.\n\nAnyway, dedicated fans hopped on a bandwagon of trashing Frozenbyte.

This most recent addition to the Trine franchise attempts to breach new ground in terms of innovative gameplay, and while respectable in concept is flawed in implementation. Trine 3 can be described as a concept piece with a limited budget. It would seem that the visuals took the cake in regards to the budget, and in doing so failed to incorporate what makes the Trine franchise so enjoyable in it's previous iterations.\n\nFirst of all the mechanics of the game received a complete downgrade, from the lackluster puzzles to the touchy combat, and the greatest offender - the platforming. Gone are the collectible items of Trine 1, gone are the unique skills of the three heroes in Trine 2. Each hero has been given one sole ability, from the Wizard's one box, to the Knights glide and the Thief's hook swing. This negates much of what made platforming such an enjoyable experience - the variety and complexity of how to traverse the terrain. In fact, the simplicity of movement was very important, and with the "3D" visuals one would need a sharper eye and the ability to perceive depth and distance more accurately.\n\nSecondly, Trine 3 unfortunately manages to completely bypass any semblance of an original tracklist, and instead makes use of remixed music from both the previous titles. This is something that I can often look beyond, but as the previous Trine games have always delivered incredibly original, exceptional and beautiful music that I was saddened to see Trine 3 without it's own unique musical flair.\n\nThirdly, Trine 3 was surprisingly bereft of a story. It's narration was scattered, and it's length incredibly short. The focus this time around was on the origins of the Trine, and throughout the narrative we gain little insight (if just slightly enough), on the Trine, the other artifacts, and our heroes antagonist - Sarek. Perhaps if the developers had taken this story to it's conclusion... perhaps if they had continued with another mission or two? Rebuild the Trine this game, not the next. Give us a climax to the events of the game, not a complete cutoff halfway through.\n\nNow, perhaps the title's saving grace would be the fantastic visuals. The new "look" boasts some magnificient visuals and artwork as well as reasonably well designed and animated character and object models. Most importantly, the absolutely stunning game level backdrops are quite the treat. Looking beyond the surface layer is where the gorgeous visuals truly shine. With Trine's attempt at 3D gameplay, much was done to develop the world in terms of it's landscape, from the rivers and oceans, mountains and canyons, castles and villages. Unique perspectives, angles and the like really add to the overall achievement in artistic design and direction.\n\nIn the end, Trine 3 is definitely a worthwhile casual product for those who truly love the Trine franchise. The dominant achievement would definitely be the excellent visuals, but the lack of mechanics and narration should (and rightly so), drive off all newcomers. I recommend Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power, but only to a degree. In the end it's best to stick to the superior Trine & Trine 2, respectively.","March 7","true","24.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's beautiful, as usual, and as to be expected from Frozenbytes. The scenery is breathtaking, and given that this is 3D makes it even better. And Soundtrack, of course, Akki really is a leading example how a composer should've been. Nothing less than magnificent. Soundtrack is included in Trine 3 folder as 192 kbps files (quite disappointing though they're not lossless, but better than nothing).\n\nThe next point... gameplay, unfortunately for gameplay... is very lacking. Game length is also very short. To be quite honest, despite the missing features, I still think it's a good game. The platformer essence is still there, although nerfed in many ways. In battle it's Pontius' chance here to shine, though, the other two are quite useless. Quite possibly this is major negative points that many players hate.\n\nFor Trine 4, I hope they can incorporate back the older features like tech trees/skills like before.\n\nStill, I prefer to recommend the game, for me to give them negative would hurt the developer unnecessarily.

Trine is truly a work of art. This is quality work and you can see it. A must try for all gamers. I'm currently at 300+ Triangles and will be completing the game. I will add more later on. Trine 3 suffers from the same problem as Trine 2, it's always too short. I finished the main campaign in 4 hours. Spoilers? Nah. Play the game to find out. Just note that there will be a Trine 4. Since the game ended too fast, pass for Frozenbyte.\n\n$5.50 on the Steam Lunar New Year Sale.\n\nPROS\n1. Graphics\nThe beauty of the world of Trine is amazing. I've played Trine 2 and it still amazes me.\n\n2. Foreground and Background\nIn and out, back and forth and even sideways. The variety of movement just allows for a great gameplay. While not fully 3D (which is not a problem at all), it gives players a change in environment that is fun to experience. You can see this in game like Little Red Riding Hood : Wolf, it's very interesting.\n\n3. Warrior Buff\nLuckily, there are some challenges that Pontius the Brave (The Warrior) is required to do. E.g. Reflecting fireballs with his shield\n\n4. The Chapter Selection Board Game\nSo cool. I loved the way the developers set up the world on a board game with giant dice and multiple pieces.\n\n5. Boss Fight\nPretty cool. I loved how the animated root is both a puzzle and a battle. E.g. Shooting his weak spot, followed by a attacking his heart\n\n6. Picture Book Puzzle\nSure, it's just a skin change of the game. But it's refreshing to play.\n\n7. Wizard's Tower\nIt's pretty well done. So far, this is the part that is most interesting.\n\n8. Kippo\nI love the giant troll? fisherman. "I haven't caught a fish all day." The way he walks off into the background is just so enthralling.\n\nCONS\n1. OP Wizard\nStill suffers from Amadeus being critical in certain puzzles. The ability to create crates is just necessary to give you that extra boost.\n\n2. Weakest Warrior\nToo many of his abilities are combat based and >50% of the game is puzzle based. Swinging the sword can be achieved by smashing heavy objects or arrows. He is useful for combat but the Thief can do the job as well. Perhaps more floating shield challenges or something only he can do underwater.\n\n3. Foreground Death\nI actually died jumping into the Foreground. Considering that you can't change the camera view, this is very bad game design.\n\n4. Too Short\n4 hours and it's over? Fail. This is too short a game to be worth the money. I was secretly hoping you were going to surprise me with the cloud around the game board disappearing and showing me a gigantic map, making me feel like the first 9 levels were just the tutorial.\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n1. Bending Light Puzzle\nPontius has a shiny shield, right? How about bending light to hit key objects by reflecting them off his shield?\n\n2. Spike Rain Puzzle\nHail of arrows. Only solvable by Pontius. Ensure that Amadeus' crate will break under the hailstorm of arrows. This will ensure that Pontius is given more importance.\n\n3. Expandable Map\nI wanted to see the clouds disappear and see an enormous map of the world of Trine with the mountains, rivers, lakes and clouds. Then the tiny heroes can run over to the location and start their adventure. The map would also be interactive and alive.","February 6","true","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

I'll edit my review when I'm done with the game.\n\nPersonally I think they did a fantastic job with the controls and puzzles. the added depth (literally) to the gameplay allows much more room to play around and find creative solutions.\n\nAbout the lack of skill upgrades: People forget that Trine 2, with its skill upgrades, was already a simplified version of Trine 1 with its additional skills and also items and trinkets that you equip for buffs and so on. Each sequel is simplifying, and that's not necessarily bad because it's a lateral change, not a step down.\n\nI have not played long enough to see if the idea of unlocking levels with gems is frustrating. In the early game it isn't, but maybe later it will be. I already like to replay levels, so I doubt this will bother me.\n\nProbably the only thing that will really bother me is the reportedly short length of the game.\n\nOverall, so far, I am loving it.

Not an amazing game like the previous titles in the series, but solid nevertheless.\n\nThe visuals are great - the game further improves upon the style used in previous installations, and the now-varying camera angle permits for even prettier views.\n\nGameplay is OK - on one hand, the hero abilities differ from Trine 1/2, but there seems sense to that:\n- The Thief's hook is replaced by a rope that clings onto specific movable and immovable objects. While this grants less movement freedom than the hook, aiming hook at arbitrary surfaces with a third-person camera would undoubtedly be a complete mess, and the rope is given it's own features (tying objects together and/or tying around corners and objects).\n- The Wizard only summons boxes now. A bit of a shame, of course, but then, summoning planks would imply rotating planks, and that would require more buttons for a rather clumsy result (try building a house of cards in Tabletop Simulator, for example).\nRegardless, the game makes decent use of old and new mechanics to create a bunch of little puzzles with multiple solutions.\n\nAudio is great, featuring an OST by the same amazing Ari Pulkkinen that did the music for the previous titles of the game.\n\nOnline multiplayer is good. Has a few quirks, but remains playable, and in my experience does not have any major issues. The only thing to mention here is that the levels are the same regardless of the number of the players, so playing together only opens new ways of completing puzzles and levels through cooperation.\n\nOn the obvious downside, the game is pretty short. That's a thing.\nHowever, there's a thing that places it aside of other shorter-than-expected games - it has a level editor and Steam Workshop support.\nAnd not just any level editor, but the same level editor that was used to make levels in the actual game - you can do anything that you see in the game with it. And publish it on workshop. And play it with people online.\nSo you could make a bunch of custom levels. Or modify the standard levels to make them harder (be that obstacles or puzzles). Or use scripting to just mess with things and make something that works completely differently.\nThere's an official wiki[frozenbyte.com] on the editor too.\nHaving seen many games, I think this is a very important thing long-term.\n\nAll things said, I consider this a worthy title for a collection,","April 16","true","10.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Graphics are beautiful, levels are fun, and the puzzles are not overly intense.  Expect a short, but gratifying game that is easy to finish in a weekend.\n\nPROS-	wow, super amazing 3D graphics with ultra details\n-	fun levels that are well thought out\n-	varying gameplay between the three characters\n-    books with teeth\n\n\nCONS-	the super amazing 3D graphics sort of ruin the old style of gameplay\n-	no skills get upgraded\n-	lack of replayability, it’s really short\n\nTHE FULL FRENCHED PRESSED CUP REVIEW\nI had the pleasure of playing this game in alpha and finished all the levels a long time ago.  When I went back to the game after it was officially released, I found all my save files were removed and I’d have to play the game over from the beginning.  I half expected that, so I just backlogged playing the full game at that point.  Fast forward to mid 2016 and I finally got around to playing it over again.  The majority of the game was already finished when I played it last, so really I only got a few new levels and a few new side quests to complete after my replay.  All that said, it was a enjoyable game albeit rather short.\n\nTo be fair, I played Trine 2 and Trine 1 at the same time as when I was starting out on Trine 3.  There were pluses and minuses.  While I rather enjoyed the level action oriented design on Trine 3, I felt the puzzles themselves took a backseat.  Trine 1 honestly had the best puzzles of the bunch, with Trine 2 following behind that.  Part of the reason, I feel, is that the game no longer was in 2 planes, but had a 3rd plane of movement that often changed the way Trine 3 dealt with objects.  It sort of resembled Prince of Persia more than Trine and I think some puzzle design had to be simplified because of it.  Another reason might be because it moved along at a faster pace than the other Trine games, slow puzzling would off-set the momentum built into those levels.  You can’t go through a harrowing escape only to get stuck on a puzzle that takes extra time – or maybe I am wrong, I think Resident Evil has a fair amount of that with no issues.  In any case, the design of Trine 3 is more action, puzzle platforming with a emphasis on using the 3rd plane of movement.  Also, there is no skill leveling as before, making the skills you start with the same as the ones you end with.  Does that make it a bad game?  No.  Does it make it a better game? Also, no.  Is it a good game at all?  Yes.  And that is entirely because it’s still Trine and you still get that thought provoking gameplay where you can attack the situation at hand with three different characters that play very differently.\n\nAnd that’s where I address gameplay.  You can switch between Amadeus, who is a cube conjuring-levitation expert magician ( mage, wizard, warlock, I am not sure of the proper term used in the game );  Pontius, a very powerful warrior who can float quite well on his shield as well as block/ground pound/ and divert things; and Zoya, a very agile thief who uses ropes to pull and move ringed objects.  I used an Xbox controller for gaming and found it very intuitive to use…except for Amadeus.  I thought it worked better using a mouse and keyboard for him.  Often, I’d be right in front of an object for him to levitate and not be able to get the object to comply with my controller.  Over and over again I would fail to grab the object with the blue “X” button highlighted, plus moving the object was substantially more difficult with a controller once I got it.  Playing Trine 2 was a LOT easier.  I’d use Amadeus the least amount if I could, but I felt the puzzles relied on him and Pontius substantially more than Zoya.   Once in a while, I’d use Zoya but only to get an elevator working or pull some gates up.  You *need* to use Amadeus and Pontius a great deal more often. So, I went through using my controller for Amadeus and it didn’t hinder me until the end levels where his slow reactions became a huge detriment.  I tried mouse and keyboard and while I could maneuver with him better, I was slower with the other characters.  So, back to the controller for me and finally finished the game.\n\nNow, I’ve read some criticisms of the game being too short, bad camera angles, odd controls that are imprecise, etc.  Honestly, those are *all* solid complaints and I won’t try to defend them.  Yes, the game is rather short.  The studio simply did not have the funds to make it a full fledged Trine game.  I *did* have some weird camera angles, nothing game breaking, but yes somewhat annoying.  The controls are a bit slow when using Amadeus as noted, but perfectly fine for Pontius and Zoya. So, shortcomings aside, it is still a good game on it’s own merit.  I love the Trine games, and that alone gets them in the ballpark for me.  You’ve got the rope swinging, battle ground pounding, conjuring bits of fun that I enjoyed in Trine 1 and Trine 2.  That said, you won’t have the same feeling as you do in Trine 1 and 2.  Different games, don’t expect the same gameplay or puzzles.  You most likely will not get stuck for a bit as you do in Trine 1 and 2 where you use some extra brain cells to figure out what to do next.  For a short, fun action puzzler that looks AMAZING then Trine 3 is a nice game to finish in a weekend.  Plus, I think Amadeus has a wonderfully goofy walk that makes my 7 year old laugh when I try to walk like that.  7.5/10.","June 6","true","30.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's far more simple, with each hero only having one ability. The shortness and price are also a factor - I played for 5.2  hours and finished it 100%. Not worth £15 at all, maybe a fiver.

You can't grapple entire surfaces anymore, only specific spots on surfaces, can't move whole platforms with the wizard (not sure yet if blessing or curse), nor draw crates or beams, they are created when you press a button, etc. Right now the click-detection is seriously buggy, physics range from acceptable to horrendous, game-mechanics are communicated poorly (which is a big problem considering many of them are counter-intuitive) and the game is seriously unfinished. On top of all of that, the game suffers the typical shortfalls of a 3D platformer, such as impossible-to-gauge distances and random deaths from leaps of faith.\n\nCould it be really good once finished? Absolutely, and I hope it will be. Would I recommend you buy it now? Absolutely not.\n\nI will update my review in a while when the progress is a bit further along.\n\n\nEDIT/UPDATE:\n\nI just replayed the first levels (and the new levels they added), and they fixed many of the issues I had previously, and added cool new mechanics (new to Trine as a series) to the recently-added levels. I feel like now that there's over an hour of fun gameplay here, I can change my recommendation to "yes", they're hard at work and it shows.\n\nEDIT/UPDATE 2:\nI can't believe they just released....the game is super-short and still suffers from many of the complaints I previously brought up.

But the ones before did as well. Exciting and complicated puzzles\nshould make you blend out the good looks. Intermissions, story moments etc. should get you\nback into enjoying them. Sadly Trine3 lacks in the puzzle area. Worse, the great visuals come at a high performance cost. I don't run a perfect gaming system atm but a game like Trine should be able to run with high framerates on any modern computer. (I7, Quadro) Lowest quality, no vsync, reduced resolution and it still feels sluggish.\nTakeaway:\n- Keep the more flexible and even better looks. (Walking through the pages of a book etc.)\n- Make sure the game runs fast enough for extensive puzzling.\n\nEnvironment:\nThe engine allows for full 3d movement, the logic however, does not. Input is typically limited to two dimensions with mouse and keyboard. Using WASD and the mousewheel to control 3 dimensions is not a well trained method. It only works as a gimmick in some puzzles when you bring a box closer to the front or back.\nInstead of real 3d puzzles Trine3 uses different slices of 2d. In Trine1 and Trine2 you make your way between left and right as well as up and down. Trine3 adds front to back traversal. But most puzzles are reduced to a 2d logic either by walking on the ground plane or by working on a single logical depth layer. Sometimes the logical dimensions are bent and twisted around the 3d environment. Walking a curved balcony still means walking backwards or forwards.\nTakeaway:\n- Keep the 3d environment as a technical base.\n- Slice more strictly into 2d for puzzles, to reduce input back to 2d.\n\nPuzzles:\nMostly disappointing. Most puzzles are not about "Huh? Lets see. How can I solve this?".\nIts more like "Urgh. Do I really have to make those jumps and move all those boxes?".\nI was rarely amazed by how a puzzle could be solved. Most of them are straightforward. A few combinations with Zoyas ropes were interesting, but I would not see them on par with Amadeus planks and boxes from the former games. They are also less comfortable to experiment with, since the rigid body dynamics of planks and boxes are a lot easier to understand.\nIts understandable that the enviroment and selected skills make it hard to build great puzzles. But that is the challenge for a Trine game. Amadeus has been heavily reduced, most likely because controls would be too bothersome with all his flexibility from Trine1 and Trine2. But Zoyas rope trick are not making up for it enough. Mostly its "Tie this, pull here, tie that". There are many single character levels, which I see as a sign that the skills are not that well balanced and in combination make the quality of the puzzles drop.\nTakeaway:\n- Go for new skills and new combinations. Trine1 and Trine2 are already made.\n- Support more variety/experimenting by using simpler to control and better to anticipate skills. Trine needs the "Wait! What if...?" moments.\n\nStory and progress:\nTo me Trine was never about a great story. It was about great delivery. With that it is very hard to keep the quality up, because repeating things will make them taste shallow. But I am sure Trine3 was a good deal below its possibilities. With the first two games I never felt like "Oh. Thats where the kids are supposed to laugh, right?" Trine3 did not much to entertain me around the puzzles.\nThe grindable map is nice for backtracking, but backtracking and grinding Trine feels wrong to me. I prefer a more strict separation of story mode and puzzle mode / multiplayer. I do not see much replay value in finding a few pickups that I missed. The former games motivated me, to be thorough because I wanted to buy upgrades. But I also felt like strictly progressing forward through a story. Trine3 lets me replay everything as much as I like. Even parts of a level. But I am neither driven to make progress nor do I care about the pickups. Except for when they stop me from entering another level. A required number of pickups and grinding reduces reduces the gratification from "getting past that spot, so I can move on".\nTakeaway:\n- Trine is not about the perfect story. Its about delivery and three characters.\n- Some people want the linear experience. Some people want to grind puzzles alone or with friends. You should be able to support both.","December 14, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And it delivered and kinda disappointed at the same time. Because the worlds are now 3D, the controls have changed to work with a 3D world instead of a 2D world. It takes some time getting used to the new controls. Controls are accurate and responsive. Graphics are fantastic. Music is great, but not as great as Trine 2 (and some of Trine 1's tracks).\n\nWhat I Love: The 3D graphics, the 3D worlds and the ability to move in any direction. The ability to use with 3D TVs for an amazing 3D experience. Some fantastic new creativity in worlds and other characters you have to interact with (but also a negative-see below). Moving into the screen in 3D is a fun and exciting experience.  While they got the 3D nearly perfect, they didn't spend enough time developing a game better than Trine 2.\n\nWhat I Hate: The single character levels where there are no checkpoints. If you fall, or slip into death by accident, you have to repeat the entire level from the beginning. It gets frustrating when you are inches from the end of a level. Some of the levels are not easy. While practice makes perfect, it's more frustrating than enjoyable. This game is also shorter than the first two games. Also what's missing is the character puzzles from Trine 2 which made it so amazing. It seems there is less creativity put into this game and more focus on getting the 3D right. Not a good tradeoff. I would have been happier with a 2D game with much better and properly developed game made better than Trine 2. Also, the music is not as good as the first two games.\n","November 22, 2015","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are few negative sides to the game.\n\nThe story is very short. It ends on a huge cliffhanger. The whole game up to the end can be considered as introduction to the story and where you expect it to really begin it ends. Very unfortunate.\n\nControls are a little bit different from previous parts and navigating in 3D is confusing at time. It can be a challenge to land where you panned to.\n\nEnemies are weak though and can be ignored completely. It's a shame, because they added extra challenge in previous parts.\n\nI would recommend the game to fans of the series.

None of these negative reviews can deny this. I loved every second of this game, as few as there were, and I can't say I wouldn't buy it again knowing what I know about the game.\n\nThe criticisms must be met with some agreement; the wizard loses out on some of his original feel without being able to pile up an absurd number of objects in the environment, of course, and the thief does feel a bit more simple as far as aiming goes, but don't let that fool you into thinking this game is a cop out from the developers.\n\nThe true fault of the game is that Frozenbyte, a young, ambitious studio, bit off more than they could chew with the third dimension. Once again, the studio did amazingly well in the visual department, and have a good framework for an amazing game...\n\nBut they ran out of money, so the game's short. It took me six and a half hours to beat this game with some extra work put in for some collectibles. Take that how you will: they cut off the story, so it doesn't seem hasty or rushed; they just have about 10-12 more levels to make.\n\nI highly recommend that Trine lovers do buy this game, albeit wait for a sale maybe.

But it could change with the release of an expansion pack.\n\nBecause as Trine 3 stands, it is litterally half of a game.\nThe ending happens suddenly after 5-6 hours (if you go slowly to get the collectibles) when you have collected half of the macguffins items you are supposed to need in the story, and the heroes wander into the sunset (metaphorically) with a massive cliffhanger.\n\nI can enjoy short games, when they leave me with the feeling of having experienced a full product featuring a full story.\nBut here we are left with an unresolved story, and the gameplay itself barely has introduced new gameplay mechanics when the game abruptly ends. The final boss is basically a random dude and not even the main villain's henchman. It just feels... wrong.\n\nI read Frozenbyte ran into budget issues and this is why we have this.\nBut the thing is that this expensive 3D gameplay and adjustments do not really make the game better. Arguably, the confusing perspective and the resulting trimming of features make the game worse than its predecessors.\nThe game also has some bugs, including one which caused a network game to delete my save somehow, which was quite infuriating.\n\nFortunately I bought this at the christmas sale and it was discounted enough to not be a ripoff.\nTrine always has been very good... so by being "worse", Trine 3 is still not a terrible game. It has some good ideas and some stunning fairy tale visuals you expect from the series.\n...But it is just so much shorter than trine 1 or 2, and that ending clarly shows they intended to do more but had to cut it. And it is very frustrating. It leaves you with a bad feeling.\n\nI will say there is a way to make this game (almost) as great as the previous Trine games were : using the money earned with this clearly unfinished story in order to release a massive expansion pack with the rest of the adventure.\n\nThis is probably the intent of the devs, so I have good hopes for the future of the series.\n\nI still give a thumbs down for now.\nTrine 3 is not worth it except on the inevitable future sales at -50% or more. It's just better to buy the previous games if you don't have them.\n\nHowever, I'll transform this into a thumbs up if the hoped for expansion pack ever gets released.\nI still think the series has lost things by going full 3D gameplay, but if we get the full story and more content... it may not become as good as Trine 2, but it will at least be a thumbs up.","January 25","false","10.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game takes you many places in a fictional and fantastical world, having the player solve mysteries and puzzles alike, while also running into enemies and other creatures getting in your way, or possibly going for the same goal! I like the robust and ease of changing characters in gameplay in order to combat or adapt to certain situations like using the warrior to break a bridge down, having the wizard use his awesome telekinetic powers to destroy walls, or using the flexible and feline-like archer to swing across vast gaps and through the environments in order to complete their tasks!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serializer/recommended/319910/","serializer","Mumra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serializer/","236 products in account","If this were released on its own rather than as a third installment in a so-far solid series then it would undoubtedly garner a huge amount of praise, despite its very short length - I finished the main storyline in a single sitting of around 4-5 hours and there are only a handful of optional levels I have left to finish. Unfortunately, as the third part in a trilogy, it would be reasonable to have a certain degree of expectation for this release. So overall I was disappointed, but I am still recommending this game on its individual merits.\n\nSo why does it compare so unfavourably? Well, firstly, I'll discuss what it does right. The environments themselves are absolutely gorgeous and extremely detailed, even more so than the first two. The continuation of the story is compelling and the writing and voices are as excellent as ever, and it is good to see the background stories of the main characters and the Trine itself fleshed out further. The move to full 3D exploration is a bold and refreshing change and the new game mechanics, both as a reult of this and some other new additions, are certainly very interesting. Unfortunately where this falls flat is that these mechanics do not feel exploited to maximum capacity and most of the puzzles are very run-of-the-mill. Many of the more interesting puzzles and uses of the mechanics appear to be in the optional levels rather than the main quest.\n\nAdditionally these changes produce some undesirable side effects. Only being able to use the rope on specific hoops rather than on lots of surfaces feels somewhat like a step backwards. The different character abilities also feel quite redundant now since a lot of puzzles can now be completed with any character - any of them can move objects around which seems to be the solution to a ton of the puzzles.\n\nAnd sadly, the introduction of 3D environments which, as I said, was potentially a very interesting change, in the end doesn't really add anything new and is in fact even detrimental to gameplay. Exploration can be very confusing at times, and the camera angles frequently obscure the player and other things that you want to be able to see. The controls are more awkward since there is an extra axis to think about, it is slightly strange because sometimes "up" means "up" and sometimes it means "forwards". For the large part it is just a cosmetic change rather than adding anything deep in terms of gameplay, or remixing the classical gameplay elememts with this new paradigm. Mostly it feels like it's still a 2D platformer so the 3D controls just get in the way.\n\nAnother quibble is that respawning seems to have been made worse, especially on the optional single-character levels. If all your characters die you restart at the last checkpoint and sometimes there aren't enough of them. But on the single-character levels there are no checkpoints at all so you have to restart the entire map - the main reason why I haven't completed many of those levels and I'm not sure if I really want to go through and finish them all.\n\nFinally the story just doesn't wrap up in a satisfying way, due to the short length. Such a shame!\n\nSo overall, this is still a very fun game, just lacking in content, and certainly doesn't stand anywhere close to the first two. If you go in with the right expectations then hopefully you will still enjoy it.","August 24, 2015","true","5.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Sometimes it's not clear whether the character will land on a platform or fall into the abyss. Swinging on the ropes with Zoya is now rather frustrating. Moving a box conjured by Amadeus is harder than ever, and only Pontius plays more or less the same. I would say fights now even easier due to 3D and the fact it takes almost zero skill to dodge projectiles. Anyway, checkpoints are abundant and I had to load the game due to death of all characters only once.\n\nAnother downside of going into 3D is that the majority of the puzzles can now be solved in only one way. On one hand, it makes all characters equally useful (there were levels in Trine 1 and 2 that could be completed by only Zoya or Amadeus). But on the other, the game becomes quite one dimensional (pun intended).\n\nAnd, as other reviews mention, the game is really short (completed in 7 hours with 100% achievements) and ends on a cliffhanger.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Trine 3 is in no way bad, it's still true to the series and looks absolutely stunning.

The coop was fun, and we pretty much never solved a puzzle the correct way. So when Trine 3 came out, we picked it up and were all set to have a boat load of more fun... but we were sadly disappointed.\nFor starters, the new 3d take on the platforming was pretty frustrating at times, especially when you are jumping to a platform but jump to your death instead since you weren't on the same plane as the platform was. And then all leveling mechanics and the excitment of unlocking new skills was stripped from this game, so no longer can you build a giant tower on top of your friends head. And lastly... the ending. I say ending loosely here though, since the game pretty much ends once the story gets going, making it feel like they just gave up on development and wanted to released whatever they had to make some money. Maybe they planned on making it episodic, I don't know, but why the decided to do it that way I will never understand.\n\nFans of the first 2 games... as much as you might want to buy this one, I would steer clear and avoid it. All the joy that was found in the others has been stripped away and replaced with the bare bones basics. I wouldn't even purchase it on sale, and would instead recommend you play through the old games again instead of this.","February 6","false","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've just finished it and I'm still not sure. It's without a doubt the weakest of the three. You can clearly see it was rushed out and the early access stink hasn't disappeared yet. It has a lot of bugs (if you compare it to its predecessors), and it's just not polished enough. Still, both the music and the graphical artstyle are still amazing, which is the trademark of the Trine games. And the puzzles are a lot of fun too. I've certainly enjoyed myself while playing this game, but I recognise its flaws. The new 3D mechanich doesn't say anything to me, but I understand they wanted to innovate a little bit and it's pretty well made, I just would have liked it more if they had stuck with the 2D (which was also a trademark of Trine). My main problem with this game is that it's considerably shorter than the last two, lacks a variety of enviroments and puzzles and the ending is literally a "to be continued..." which I'm not that sure that'll be a Trine 4 considering this one is already a mess.\nOh, and BTW there is like just one boss, and it's the final boss, that was also a little painful.\n\nOverall I think it's disappointing and doesn't live up to the name of the saga, but it's still a Trine after all, so you know what you're getting into.

While adding a third dimension sounds exciting and like a natural direction, ultimately a series of quirks and design mistakes keep the title from living up to the brilliance that was the first two Trine games. An uncontrollable camera with terrible placement means you're running off cliffs and into enemies due to lacking proper depth perception, and constricted level design leaves you wishing it were just left-to-right linear again. If the camera was controllable by the players of the game and if the levels were opened up a bit more, the game would be amazing, but as it stands these quirks and others keep it from being the sequel the other two games deserved. And that's pretty sad, since the brief moments where you're swinging forward as Zoya from branch to branch are amazing, but they're interspersed with tedious puzzles that are a chore to navigate and solve.","January 31","false",""," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The coop was fun, and we pretty much never solved a puzzle the correct way. So when Trine 3 came out, we picked it up and were all set to have a boat load of more fun... but we were sadly disappointed.\nFor starters, the new 3d take on the platforming was pretty frustrating at times, especially when you are jumping to a platform but jump to your death instead since you weren't on the same plane as the platform was. And then all leveling mechanics and the excitment of unlocking new skills was stripped from this game, so no longer can you build a giant tower on top of your friends head. And lastly... the ending. I say ending loosely here though, since the game pretty much ends once the story gets going, making it feel like they just gave up on development and wanted to released whatever they had to make some money. Maybe they planned on making it episodic, I don't know, but why the decided to do it that way I will never understand.\n\nFans of the first 2 games... as much as you might want to buy this one, I would steer clear and avoid it. All the joy that was found in the others has been stripped away and replaced with the bare bones basics. I wouldn't even purchase it on sale, and would instead recommend you play through the old games again instead of this.","February 6","false","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On top of that they finally get around to explaining the trine and it's 2 sister components, the story feels like a half finished legend but that's where you come in.

Sometimes it's not clear whether the character will land on a platform or fall into the abyss. Swinging on the ropes with Zoya is now rather frustrating. Moving a box conjured by Amadeus is harder than ever, and only Pontius plays more or less the same. I would say fights now even easier due to 3D and the fact it takes almost zero skill to dodge projectiles. Anyway, checkpoints are abundant and I had to load the game due to death of all characters only once.\n\nAnother downside of going into 3D is that the majority of the puzzles can now be solved in only one way. On one hand, it makes all characters equally useful (there were levels in Trine 1 and 2 that could be completed by only Zoya or Amadeus). But on the other, the game becomes quite one dimensional (pun intended).\n\nAnd, as other reviews mention, the game is really short (completed in 7 hours with 100% achievements) and ends on a cliffhanger.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Trine 3 is in no way bad, it's still true to the series and looks absolutely stunning.

A series, that prides itself on its visuals, physics based puzzles and the mechanic to switch between three characters with different skillsets with just a buttonpress.\n\nWhile Trine 1 and 2 featured 2D gameplay, Trine 3 is the first title in the series to go for 3D explorable levels with fixed camera angles. And this jump into the third dimension is not without its flaws.\n\nThis game ends on a cliffhanger, because the developers were too ambitious this time around and just couldn't get all of the story finished without compromising their product, so they decided to focus on what they could afford to create with the budget at hand and keep up the quality of it. This is a problem that might happen, we have even seen big development studios that fell into that trap. And it's the right move to at least assure the quality of what's there instead of putting something together half-heartedly.\n\nSo the final product looks fantastic, the gameplay and story are true to the series. So what are the (other) problems? If you played Trine 1 or 2 you might remember you could gain new skills for all of the three characters. That's gone. Each one has about 3 skills, which is significantly less than in Trine 2. It's also not as difficult as the other ones and there are no difficulty settings to chose from, to begin with.  The puzzles are alright. The enemy variety (compared to Trine 2) has lessened.\n\nThe areas in which the developers improved were the controls (e.g. just keeping the jump button down in order to glide is soooo much more intuitive) and differentiating the characters more (the thief won't be your combat character anymore, since the knight is now really useful and the wizard won't be as useless because he now conjures a standard size box and can smash it into enemies). Also the level design was improved - all collectibles are now clearly visible - you might need to find a certain area, but they aren't hidden in the lava anymore (Trine 1) or such. Also if you want to go look for missing collectibles you can now see at which part of the level you're missing them and can jump to that checkpoint instead of playing the level again up to that point.\n\nSince there are no skilltrees and level ups, the collectibles are pretty useless this time around - they grant you access to bonus levels (which are nice to play), but nothing more than that. I always like if games unlock an art gallery or something with collectibles, so you're not forced to find them and there's a sense of worth in finding them - that's not the case here. As for bugs: I found that sometimes the thief and wizard don't exactly target the exact object you want them to interact with and the wizard sometimes has problems to interact with an object at all. Moving to another position solves this, usually.\n\nShould you get this game then? Well, maybe. If you liked Trine 1 and 2, you might be a bit disappointed, but you also might not be. If you didn't play Trine 1 or 2 before, I recommend playing them - at the very least Trine 2. If you get this, get it on sale, favourably in the collection with Trine 1 and 2. It's alright, it was too ambitious, but it still is Trine.","March 19","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Taken on its own, Trine 3 is a great game. It is visually stunning and the character movement is fluid and fun. The puzzles are fairly simple but enjoyable. If you like hunting down every last collectible the game is actually very accomodating. From the map you can see how many collectibles you are missing from each section of the level and allows you to jump straight to the section with the collectibles you are lacking.\n\nMy only real complaint is that the camera in co-op mode can be problematic. Specifically, if one player moves to another area (e.g. into a cave or through a door) the camera shifts to the fixed location for that area, leaving the other player completely out of frame. The first player will either have to go back, so they can stick together when entering the new area or the second player will have to navigate their way to the first player blind. Basically a non-issue if you always to stick close together, but can definitely get annoying when you're both running around looking for hidden paths/collectibles.\n\nPersonally, I never cared too much about the story in the Trine series, but if that is important to you, you should be aware that the game ends with the story uncompleted as they clearly intended to continue it in the next entry.\n\nAll in all, I think Trine 3 made the shift to 3D very well and its an enjoyable, beautiful, relaxing puzzle platformer.","January 28","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first two Trine games were a lot of fun, but a new style and a bunch of negative reviews did lessen my enthusiasm for this entry in the series.\n\nThen I played it.\n\nFirst, I will acknowledge that the move to 3D wasn't entirely smooth.  You do lose the progression and some of the abilities of previous games, such as the Wizard's ability to basically build your own solution to a puzzle.  The controls take some getting used to, but no more than, say, it would take some getting used to the difference between Mario and Mario 64, so that didn't really bother.  I also admit that short length and cliffhanger ending are a bit of a disappointment, although some short, though some filler levels do lengthen the proceedings a bit.\n\nBut now that I've gotten the negatives out of the way, let me talk about what I enjoyed about this game, because there is a lot.\n\nFor starters, this is definately the most beatiful looking of all the Trine games thus far.  If you pay attention to the moments when the thief is swinging across a ravine with her grappaling hook, you'll understand why they went this direction.  It is a sight to behold.\n\nThis is also the most cinematic of the Trine games so far.  You actually see the character's faces this time around, which I actually really appreciate, and instead of the stills used by the first game, it expands on the fully animated cutscenes that Trine 2 experimented with in the Goblin Menace DLC and brings them to a new height.  Quite an achievement for an independent developer.\n\nOf course the reason people didn't take so well to this one were the problems with gameplay, and understandably so.  Did the move to 3d enhance the gameplay in any way?  Yes and no.  I've already listed the cons, so let me talk about the pros here.  First, combat is actually somewhat challenging here.  It's still a bit of a button masher, but the 3D space meant I had to think harder about how I approached fighting enemies, something that was a tad mindless in the previous games, and never too challenging.  In those games I usually only died to do a risky platforming maneuver, and I rarely died to combat encounters, so smoothing out this aspect of the game is actually somewhat appreciated.\n\nOh, and remember how fun it was to occasionaly draw a box over a skeleton or a goblin and crush it in the first two?  Now that's a feature, where you can levitate a box, press a button, and smash it to the grown.  Add in the ability to move around while you levitate something, and now the wizard can acutally hold his own in combat with the other two.  I don't know about you, but there is something inherently satisfying about using telekinesis in a game to crush your enemies.\n\nHow about platforming, the thing that was best in the original games and the one thing that seemed to take the hardest hit from the move to 3D?  Even that sees some interesting improvements.  For instance, mobile or moveable platforms could be a problem in the original as there was always the frustration of jumping on the platforms before they moved in such a way prevented you from proceeding.  Here, the Thief has the ability to tie things down with her grappling hook, which can be very helpful.  Second, giving the knight the ability to glide right from the start was a godsend, and another excellent way to showcase those shiny graphics when  gliding over a big ravine.  Did I mention that the wizard can now move around while levitating?  That's pretty useful to.\n\nIn conclusion, Trine 3 is a flawed, but still very rewarding experience.  Furthermore, if it's a problem that the game was to short, doesn't that just mean you wanted more of it?  If the game were really as bad as most of the reviews were making it out to be, then the short length would be described as a blessing in disguise.  Either way, Trine 3 doesn' t quite live up to it's predecessors, but in my opinion is still well worth the ride.\n\nI'll leave it to your discretion whether or not you'll want to wait for a sale to pick this one up, but I do recemmond you pick it up at some point and give it a whirl.","January 18","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is a step up to 3D this time - so most of the time you can freely move about the location. Most of the puzzles are really easier to solve now, but the game is still interesting to play.","January 19","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can forgive a glitch here and there and laugh about it, but this was seriously broken on so many levels. Not recommended unless really really cheap.

Maybe I'm one of the select few who looked at this and thought it was amazing. I've started the trilogy at the third game and even with the stupid and menial bugs/glitches I have seen, I would have to say that I really enjoy this game. My only complaint that I have is the length of the game. I feel like the story itself could have led to a much longer sequence, but I digress. I have enjoyed the concept and even though I have started at the last installment, I plan to venture into the previous games of the series. If, according to the reviews, this is the worst game of the trilogy, I look forward into heading backwards into the previous games. All in all, after seeing the value just in watching the trailer video for Trine 3, I bought into this series. It didn't take but a few minutes into this game that I have enjoyed the concept of Trine and looked forward to the depth and intrigue into this game. I can understand the feeling that there may have been a rush to push this third sequence, but for what it's worth I appreciate all aspects of this game. I would not rate this game a 10/10 in any means. but for the value of buying this trilogy on sale I feel the money is well spent. Even if you invest time into one of the games in this trilogy, it is money well spent.\n\nLong story short, do not over look this game due to the negative reviews. It's a great pick up for the sale value. Today 12/1/15 the trilogy is $15 of which I think Trine 3 is worth the value. Watch a let's play or a walkthrough before you count this game out for the mixed reviews. You wont be disappointed, unless you highly detest the type of game, not the story or value as a whole. It has been one of the few steam games that has kept my attention for longer than 5 minutes.\n\nUpdate 12/14:\nAs of now, I have beaten Trine 3 and 1 and am finishing up Trine 2. After playing through, almost the entire series, I would have to say that Trine 3 is still, by far my favorite. Maybe it''s simply because I played 3 first. I'm not sure. I feel like the puzzles in 1 and 2 were much more easily to "cheat" through than 3. All in all I would recommend buying into the entire series. Good luck!\n\nUpdate 12/20:\nAfter making it through Trine 2 and entering into the DLC, I enjoyed the game, but with how long the DLC makes the game, I've felt like I was only playing it out of desire to finish, not enjoyment.  All in all they're all great games, but I still think I enjoyed 3 the most!","November 30, 2015","true","18.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So disappointed I am writing my first review on Steam...\n\nThe 3D system is new and takes some getting used to - and at times aggrivating - but in the end I didnt find it as bad as other reviews crack it up to be. In fact I liked that aspect of the game, being able to explore the world in new ways.\n\nThe graphics were also super enchanting - gorgeous and A LOT of detail. I won't give away too much but a couple levels feature a different kind of graphics that I found pretty cool too.\n\nBut honestly I would have traded some of that detail for some more levels and content. Also some of the puzzles just weren't that puzzling. It was bit too easy sometimes.\n\nAnd I miss the skill leveling system. I thought it was lame you just collect the triangles to get to the next level - well duh I mean what else do you do after completing one level? You go on to the next one of course...\n\nThen if I wanted to amp up combat or something and make it more difficult - nope. No such option.\nSo basically I only played it through once and there was no point in playing it again. Such a shame.\n\nOverall: you might as well take your time playing through cause it doesn't last that long anyway.","December 30, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It became plagued with glitches that made it frustrating to traverse the levels successfully even with a second player helping me out. Even when most of the glitches had cleared, some still lingered. The 3D platforming aspects, while ambitious, were not necessary. It begs to be in full 2.5D like the last game. I can now understand why the reviews were mixed for this one. The devs were trying something new and it just didn't work out, at least for me.

Why do I say this? This is because Trine 3 wittingly goes "3D," though you might have speculated correctedly that this also entails many awkard platforming moments, uncontrollable camera angles, and the occasional wonky physics.\n\nThat being said, the puzzles and platforming are so linient that it does not hinder you--and if you bring two friends it will be loads of laugh for a short time (3-4 hours) with (SPOILERS) an abrupt and unfinished ending. However, if you're just looking for a good cooperative platforming time with alternate roles just like the other Trines then I recommend it.

I traded my friend a gift copy of Trine 2 for a gift copy of Trine 3, with intentions to play the series together, but he lost interest and I decided to play them by myself.\n\nIt was going great throughout the first half of the game. I won\'t point out any details of the new 3D movement or cut skills system, because those have already been extensively covered.\n\nWhat I will talk about is the ending. Once you beat this game, it will take you a moment to realize that the credits are rolling, and the game is actually over.\n\nVERY MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD\n\nI won\'t say too much about the end, but the last level is literally just a boss battle. This would have been okay I guess if the boss battle was actually fun. Let\'s compare\n\nTrine 1: A platforming challenge followed by a brief cinematic fight. No real combat, but still challenging. Any character can finish the level\n\nTrine 2: A combat based boss battle where you shoot weakpoints on a large enemy and dodge its attacks. Mostly Zoya\'s forte but Pontius and Amadeus can still provide some support.\nPlus, the Goblin Menace DLC adds another boss battle. Generally the same thing but with an entirely new enemy and arena layout. Both are challenging and quite fun.\n\nTrine 3: A short walk to a square platform where you fight an enemy that really has no reason to fight you except the fact that what you want to get from it is lodged in one of its wierd vine-arm-things. The boss was never mentioned in any part of the story and has almost no relation to the main enemy of the story.\nThe fight consists solely of jumping over repetitive and downright annoying attacks and throwing randomly appearing fireballs at its face. No, really, that\'s it, that\'s all you do. You throw around 15 fireballs at its face and it dies. Game over. Zoya has absolutely NO part in this fight except to revive the other 2 characters. Afterwards a 20 second cinematic plays which tells you what will happen in the NEXT game. *sigh*\n\nAlthough I was disappointed,  I still recommend this game for the fact that it is still Trine and it is still a lot of fun, despite all of its flaws.  The game really does have its moments, it has expectedly stunning artwork and level design, and (in my opinion) an interesting story, until you find out that you will only get half of it. I believe that this game is good, but incredibly rushed. Perhaps that if it was sold as \"Trine 3: Chapter 1\" at half price it would have had much better feedback, though I understand that isn\'t really how marketing works.","June 1","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course, in Trine 3 it would not have been possible to include Trine 2's system due to Trine 3's length (taking my time, I 100%-ed the game with a friend in ~8 hours of play-time compared to 25 hours for Trine 2), as the developers simply couldn't have hidden enough of those trinkets you had to collect.\n\nThe main novelty - 3D gameplay - was nice to see but just raised too many problems, on the one hand with the controls, on the other hand for the devs as the level design became too expensive, prohibiting a longer game.\n\nThe coop experience was good as usual for Trine games; we faced quite a few technical problems (mostly related to poor ping between my friend and myself) but eventually managed to complete the game.

This game is just so unfinished! All this final version of the game is is the Early Access build with 1 or 2 tweaks and a couple more main levels and a bunch of boring side "challenges."\n\nFor the positives, like it's predecessors, this game is so damn beautiful. If anything, Frozenbyte's engine can really pump out great graphics at a smooth framerate. Other than that, new puzzles with Zoya's rope mechanics are a great addition to the game.\n\nFor the negatives, the combat is still the same from the Early Access build, which basically consists of having Pontius run around and mash X and Y to kill things, or spam RT with Zoya. And since there's no alternate weapons or upgrades for the characters, it gets old FAST. You'll basically end up just knocking enemies off cliffs as Pontius and going on your merry way. Enemies will also only spawn in on combat arena sections of each level, which makes every encounter even more monotonous and predictable.\n\nWhen you're not locked in the simple combat, you're stuck in a platforming collectathon for "Trineangles". I don't mind collectathons much, but it's almost all you do in Trine 3 and it's extremely dull. And this is MANDATORY to unlock all levels in the final build, which is insane. Puzzles are generally ultra simple and nonexistent.\n\nOften times while hunting Trineangles and progressing through a level, you'll be trying to judge where you'll land or where you are in relation to other objects, as the new 3D element of Trine 3 makes it hard to orientate yourself. To be honest, the 3D aspect doesn't even add anything to the experience, rather than detract enjoyment from it. This probably wouldn't be an issue if Trine 3 didn't hold onto the right analog as its crutch and gave players full 3D camera control with it instead, though of course the levels weren't designed with this in mind.\n\nTo make things even worse, issues from the Early Access that should have been polished up STILL persist, e.g. object collision (I literally ran through an object within 1 minute of the first level in the final build). Hell, even the story feels unfinished as there's NO resolution. The last level leaves you with a massive cliffhanger and nothing else, as if the rest of the game had to be cut short.\n\nIn short, do not buy this game unless you want a glorified tech demo. If curosity grips you, wait until a sale at the very least. You'll be done and fed up with this game in 4 hours and want your money back.","November 23, 2015","false","6.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are some features that the game retains. The platforming being one of them, the characters being another and of course the beautifully enchanting visuals. Now there are a number of things that sets Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power apart from it's predecessors. The first being that there's no leveling system, all of the skills learnt in the previous games e.g Pontius' shield gliding ability and Zoya's fire arrows, to note two, are now given to you from the very start. Another difference, and quite a major one, is the camera angle(s). No longer are you bound to a 2D plane, you can now wander freely in 3D world. This does make the game more interesting, and puts the puzzling elements through their paces, Although at times it can be hard to judge the distance between certain platforms and how far away enemies are. One quite important thing to note is that this iteration of the game does seems to lack the amount of puzzles that the previous games in the series had. Also, not to mention, the difficulty seems to have been ramped up a little, not helped by the fact that it can't be changed, also unlike the previous two games.\nThere are a number of moments in the game where it becomes incredibly frustrating, with the scarce number of checkpoints and the fairly annoying, and pointless, side quests that pit you against multiple waves of foes.\nAlthough retaining some of the original traits of the previous games, Trine 3 is sadly a bit of a disappointment. With bugs and glitches scattered around each level and the constant demand to battle enemies in order to progress, this game just feels like it's missing the original charm. The story is fairly well put together, however, and the characters are still as charming as ever. But sadly, for the most part Trine 3 is too lacking in what the series is known for. As a fan of the other two games, it saddens me to have to down vote this game. If you want to play the whole series then you have to play The Artifacts of Power. But if you want a puzzle based platformer that's very much like the previous two in the series, then I suggest looking elsewhere.

However, everything else about this game is thoroughly enjoyable. I play games on GNU/Linux exclusively and the performance for this game on my OS is great. The art direction is top notch, as in the last two games. Everything about this entry feels like a worthy addition to the Trine franchise.\n\nThere are some things different in this game, most notably the lack of skill progression. I know former Trine fans might really miss that, but honestly I felt rather ambivalent about it myself. I mean... does it really make much sense anymore anyways? For me, I love Trine for its light-hearted storybook-style fairy tale setting and story. It actually kind of bugged me that if you played the first Trine you started off in Trine 2 without some of the skills you gained in the first one, and some don't even exist in Trine 2 that existed in the first Trine. Likewise when people complain that Amadeus can no longer conjure more than 1 box at a time in Trine 3, I have only to remind everyone about the lack of floating platforms in Trine 2, other player abilities, equipment in chests, etc. So, it's not without precedent.\n\nI actually think it's good to see Frozenbyte trying to stretch out and experiment. Accordingly, having the freedom to move along the Z axis in 3D is a great addition. At first I was skeptical and thought it might be too confusing or change up the core gameplay mechanic. But, how it's implemented is done really well. It's different enough to be interesting, but subtle enough to keep things familiar and intuitive.\n\nReally, the biggest thing for me (as I mentioned earlier) is the story, and Trine 3 presents something very intriguing that recontextualizes the two prior entries in the franchise. I don't want to give any spoilers away, but suffice it to say the game goes back to its roots and sets out to answer a question I hadn't really thought to ask before: what is the Trine in the first place? What is *its* origin?\n\nIt's not just this new revelation either. The game also goes back to its roots in bringing back skeletons and other darker elements seen in the first Trine. I actually played Trine 2 first, so going back to the first Trine felt a bit disjointed at first, since the story seemed more epic and a little darker. Trine 3 manages to keep the light-hearted fun tone of Trine 2 while telling a story more on par with the first Trine.\n\nSadly, it looks like the devs were shooting for a story scope that would fit the epic premise of Trine 3. I say sadly, because the game ends rather abruptly on a cliffhanger. Maybe in the future with a DLC or two the story presented can be properly finished. I know some players could look at this as some kind of money grab, since in the past with Trine 2 its DLC expansion was truly an expansion, with the original story relatively standing alone.\n\nBut, y'know, even there there's precedent. Plenty of films have ended on cliffhangers, and $8 for a 2 hour film at the theatre is still more expensive than $22 for a 6 hour game--especially when said game also includes multiplayer.  (Disclaimer: I actually only purchased the game while it was on sale here recently, but mainly that's because I was waiting to get the game once the Linux version exited Beta).\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend getting this game if you like the Trine series. It's definitely different than the prior entries, but if you go into it with an open mind you might just be pleasantly surprised.","November 8, 2015","true","10.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

People liked the first game. More people loved the second game. And then? ♥♥♥♥ everything up with part 3.\n\nAlso many people "knew" that would happen after the first infos were published. They were afraid that the concept would ♥♥♥♥ the franchise. And it did.\n\nTrine 3 doesn't look so nice and charming anymore in 3D, the controls are damn bad, no more upgrade-system. AND much worse: Now the game is full of bugs and glitches. It's more work than fun.\n\nAlso it seems like there are less puzzles and more action (who had that gread idea? "Cut the part out we're good in!" )\n\nStory (damn short and not complete) and Minilevels are okay. One level is really cool and have a nice idea but the rest is...meh. Most jump parts you can solve by just putting a box on the next stage and then using the rope to climb up. It always looks like you should use other ways but you rarely need them.\n\n\n\nIf you never played Trine then better buy Trine 1+2. Part 3 lost the Trine-spirit. It seems like they thought that they have so much more possibilities in 3D but then they recognized: "Well, maybe not our best idea but now it's too late to change that."\n\n\nOnly buy in sale or you when you play this game with friends so can laught together about the problems of this game!","March 27","false","4.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

The platforming is much more difficult because it's harder to figure out where you are and where you will land. And the developers cut down on the amount of abilities you have to basically one per character. This is most evident with the wizard which can now only conjure up one box and move objects. This means that the puzzles are much more simple and tranversing the terrain is not nearly as fun. It basically boils down to putting down one box with your wizard and using your archer to grapple up to it and jump on the platform. And it makes the combat annoying as well, because it's very easy to miss your target because of the skewed camera angles which you can't switch.\n\nThe transition to 3D also greatly expanded the budget, which means the developer ran into difficulties halfway through and had to finish up the game. So what we received is half of the game which was originally intended to be made. And it shows in the story, because it really feels you're only halfway through once you're done, maybe not even that.\n\nThat being said it's still a solid game and the biggest problem with Trine 3 is that it comes after 2 extremely well made games which already showcased how to do things properly. If this were a new IP it would have been much better received. If you're willing to take this game as it is you'll enjoy your time with it, so I am going to recommend it (if you get it at a reasonable discount).\n\n6 / 10","May 15","true","4.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The criticism it is getting for the shortness and lack of character progression are valid, though these are the only important criticisms.  Outrage over the shortness of the game could have been easily prevented by being up-front about the length of the game and lowering expectations.  I think $10-$15 is reasonable for a game of this complexity even though it can be done in 4-6 hours.  It is a very polished and fun game, and people are mad because they want more of it!  The only way to get more of it is to support the developers, so if this is your main concern, please recommend the game!\n\nAbout the gameplay, I can see how the move to 3D was very difficult, since the interaction between abilities and level design and camera all are very polished, and it is a better game for it in my opinion.  The more gameplay elements you add, it will get exponentially harder to make everything work together.\n\nI think in its current state, it would be very difficult to add more abilites to the characters.  Different arrows for the archer would be pretty easy to add, and maybe have the knight's butt-stomp be unlockable in addition to some hammer and shield abilites.  The mage is the hardest to add progression to, because the game already has a lot of easy verticality due to wall-jumps that render additional boxes and planks redundant for most things.  To remedy this, I think only certain surfaces should be wall-jumpable.  For example: slippery rocks = no wall-jump, weeds/plants = yes wall-jump.  That way the level designers can control vertical gameplay a bit better and allow for the mage to have interesting conjurables.  And maybe have an interesting plotline so the poor guy can finally learn to fireball!\n\nI will be very sad enough people shy away from this so they can't afford a 2nd half (or really, last two-thirds or three-quarters).  I would fund it on Kickstarter in a heartbeat, though!","August 27, 2015","true","6.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Probably,  but I guess  since  Frozenbyte is developing it, feedback  would only  increase in positivity.\n\nSo, Trine 3: Artifacts of Power. The Game that continues where  the best indie game ever left -  from  point of three heroes in fanntasy world,  who had plenty of adventures already. Let's  get straight to Cons  and Pros:\nCons\n-Story  seems to be repetitive a bit from Previous games at the start\n-Not many Levels  so far, in Early Access?...... Hope we see more soon\n- The controls are not as "Satisfactory" as in, say, Trine 2-  ie. Wizard  is not creating the boxes by "drawing" them, but rather  makes them appear with 1- button Press,   Zoya  can no longer  attach to Any wooden surfacess,  Pontius  is a bit hard to control, in terms of moving around and blocking- but, as always,  it can be easy to get used to eventually.\n- The  whole extra dimension  of Gameplay  seems a bit Raw,  and Buggy  at times,  when moving objects/ walking.\n\nPros (Get READY!)\n-The Whole  new Flippin'  Dimension! Now, you can   move in 3D, rather  than just in  2D- platformer- way\n-The Graphics  and  Effects (evaluated  together here)-  Much more Detailed  and satisfying visual experience!\n- The Physics-  despite  being a bit confusing in 3D,  you can actually do a hell of a lot more with Environment and objects now!  Not to spoil  much,  you  can  already create boxes  easier  (which can be seen as advantage  as Well!) and   now  Wizard has a power  to "use Force" to smash them downwards, Zoya has new rope physics for Puzzles, Etc.\n- The Voice- over-  As always,  the amazing  story must be combined  with great acting- and in this Case,  VA is perfect!\n-  The Bonuses-  the "extra"  areas, like challenges  and a Whole  Garry's mod-  like Physics  sandbox room included now!\n\nObviously,  I managed to stream  and Upload my First  experience with this soon-  to- be masterpiece on Steam: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zwwo_JSwEg\n\nPS oh, And obviously,   "Do you recommend this game?" You dam serious ?  It's  Trine! 3! from  the FrozenByte!

The controls are excellent and aiming is 2nd nature.\n\nThe bad:\nThe 'lite-rpg' elements are gone: no skill points to dole out, no level ups or power ups.  I think the reason these are gone is because the game is just too short.  With only 4 - 5 hours of content, there isn't enough time to level so they just removed it.\n\nUltimately if you enjoyed the other trine games you're going to enjoy this but will end up feeling jipped of content when the credits roll.","September 4, 2015","true","5.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I had my doubts about making the jump to 3D over 2D but it works fantastically, albeit with a few issues but nothing game breaking.\n\nThis early access release is fairly short. I completed the two story missions and the challenge mission in around an hour and a half but they're still quite enjoyable. Along with the fact that there will be mod support as well as new levels added over the course of early access I have no doubt there will be plenty of game here going forward.\n\nHaving said that $20 is still a bit pricey for 3 levels so maybe consider waiting until there's more content available before purchasing but that's my only real complaint which can be easily rectified.\n\nLooking forward to revisiting it at full release.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MYxBSiDDc4&list=PLdz5FE73bTSr5t1iw3tNP5NbrH7GxExgU&index","April 22, 2015","true","4.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

While Trine 2 had difficult puzzles, Trine 3 was in most cases, VERY straightforward. Little to no effort has to be put in trying to solve the puzzles to progress in the levels... Trine 2 easily kept me busy for 29 hours (and I still don't have all the achievements). Trine 3, although adding 3D into the game, just doesn't keep me busy for that long. Needed only 3.5 hours to complete this game. It just feels like an unfinished game. The story ends on a cliffhanger what feels like halfway through what the actual game should've been.

The game is beautiful as always, the length of the game... No I will not sink 700 hours into Trine 3 but it is not $100 either!  I paid a few $ on sale and I get plenty of $$$ worth of enjoyment.

There was no "puzzle" solving or anything of the like, it was a "Oh look at our pretty backgrounds, here we will move the camera around for you even if it doesn't help you progess through the part you are at because the path you need to take is in the foreground, but our background is so pretty" game. They also did some crap where they gave you a "full game" and only put 1/3 of the story in it. So now I have to wait for and buy the DLC/other game inorder to finish the, not even that interesting, story. Also as you can see, this game was ridiculously short. And about 2 of the 5 hours that I have in this game probably weren't in the main story, rather that time was spent in little mini-quests that had no purpose. Another horrible aspect was the bland combat. Trine 2 had a great system where you could upgrade your character to better suit your purposes and have a little bit of extra fun, and it also made all characters combat viable, in this, each character has 1 kind of attack (except the knight who technically has 3, but only one is particularly useful) and the theif and wizard are completly useless in combat. All the wizard can do is try to navigate his box around the convoluted camera angles and slam it on enemies, and the theif has to attempt to land arrows on the enemies with the same problem, renedring them both useless. Tl;DR: This is a watered down Trine 2, play that and the first game instead, ignore this incomplete title.","January 6","false","5.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

First of all i was stunned about the fact, that we now can go into and out of the camera view! so its 3D moving not only right and left. Its amazing and works good in the new World!\n\nThis New Feature allows a lot new Combinations of the abilities from Amadeus, Pontius and Zoya!\n\nThe Graphics got even better and you must love the art Design! The optical differneces between the levels are huge. Especially in the beginning (Castle-Forest and the Lazy Magician at the beach ^^)\n\nSome Points i recognized while playing (keep in mind its early acces so its no problem, just information for you and the the developers to make the game even better):\n\n-Dialogues and Sounds are not active (just music is playing (but wonderfull, harmoning music!)\n-Sometimes the character freezes and you move while frozen^^ (anybody else is thinking at olaf right know? xD)\n-Zoyas head got stuck in the wall\n-Pontius glitched into a gate, but became free after a short moment\n-The hook and rope from Zoya can be extended and shortend by scrolling the mousewheel) Thats preety annoying, but on the gamepad it works fine with the joystick\n-The Physics from the boxes are unrealistic by now (flies through the room by literally blowing at it sometimes)\n-Some bugs at the clothings (e.g. Zoyas leg comes through the her dress)\n-The 3D feature allows you to fall down the cliff in the for-and background. That happens very often if you´re not concentrate enough\n-Some lags while jumping with zoya up and down at a wall (assassins creed style :P)\n\nSo i´m glad to say it will be an epic 3rd part of Trine and you will have fun and surprise moments especially in coop! don´t play it alone take a box of beer pizza and friends and play all night long (even when it will end in jumping and trying to fight against the other  one or pushing your bros down just until they will take their revenge, all for the fun for sure^^)\n\nSo start again for an epic journey with a threesome group beeing addicted to THE TRINEE! :D\n\nSee ya\nAnduril","April 23, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you are a fan of the series, I can heartily recommend this sequel, you will not regret picking it up. If you did not enjoy its predecessors, then you will not find that much different in the third game and should probably pass it by.\n\nA few more detailed remarks:\n- The artwork and soundtrack are once again lovely. Game world and characters have become even more detailed than in the previous game.\n- The new 3D movement adds a lot of depth to the levels and puzzles. Unfortunately the controls feel a bit clunky at times and the fixed camera can get in the way. There were a few instances where I died simply because I couldn't even see my character.\n- There are a few interesting new gameplay mechanics. Most notably, Zoya can now pull objects around with her grappling hook and tie them to other objects / surfaces. This makes for very cool solutions to some of the more challenging puzzles.\n- The game feels a bit short. My boyfriend and I went through it in about 7 hours, and that includes all possible bonus missions / challenges. The story ends at a point where you'd expect it to finally kick off properly (the rest is really just lots of exposition and prologue) and it's obvious that there is at least one addon/sequel planned, probably more. Of course you can't expect a full 200h fantasy RPG for this price and Trine 3 certainly isn't designed to fill that format, but I still would've liked a bit more content for my money.\n- I can't say much about the singleplayer and local multiplayer modes, but we've had a few issues with the online multiplayer mode. Our games seemed to get out of sync with each other fairly often, symptoms of which include inconsistent state (obstacle destroyed on one screen vs. still intact on the other), flickering or random teleportation of characters and maneauvers failing simply because the other player is not exactly where you see him on your screen. None of these things are gamebreaking, but they can be quite annoying. We also had a very strange bug in the final level, where the flaming lava projectiles needed to defeat the end boss would only spawn when one player was tabbed out of the game. It took us several minutes of frantically trying to figure out what we were supposed to be doing (we even tried to fling the Knight character at the thing with a sort of catapult contraption) before discovering the solution by accident when one of us tabbed out to check a walkthrough.\n- The new physics and rope engine, while being a central part of the gameplay, can also be quite buggy. Ropes snap for no apparent reason, the Thief character sometimes gets thrown around wildly instead of pulling an object towards herself, and once my partner was killed by a thrashing rope bridge gone berserk at the slightest nudge. Again, nothing gamebreaking as such, but it can be annoying.\n- The puzzles in general feel a bit weakly defined. Obviously there are always multiple solutions to most problems to accomodate the different characters / amounts of players present, but sometimes it seemed like there were maybe too many solutions, to the point where we couldn't figure out what we were supposed to be doing. We often ended up cheating our way through a level by boosting each other up with the wizard character or just building big stacks of crates to the exit, instead of finding a "proper" solution.\n\nDespite all of this, Trine 3 is good game. I think it would have had the potential for being a lot better, e.g. if the gameplay were a more polished and it had a bit more content, but it's still good value for its price.","August 23, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

However, it is a great game. Yes, you can see they miscalculated the cost/complexity of going full 3D and this cost them to have to release a game that's much shorter than they envisioned. Remember this isn't Ubisoft, EA or Activision with infinite pockets and market researchers crunching numbers. Frozenbyte is a very small studio consisting of a bunch of dedicated gamers/designers.\n\nThat said, would you rather them give us a short piece of fun, learn from the experience and make a better Trine 4; or go broke and never again see another Trine? With the recent %50 discount (when I bought it) this game is now priced right, as it definitely feels like half the game it should have been.\n\nBuy it and play it, specially now that's $11. It's fun, it's absolutely GORGEOUS - production values were seriously increased in this third game. I say buy it because for nearly ten bucks, the half game we got is certainly worth it. Another reason is that I want Frozenbyte to get money out of this, because they surely learned their lesson and will apply this knowledge to Trine 4.\n\nI want Trine to keep happening. Frozenbyte got too ambitious and messed up a few things this time around, don't be a vengeful person and boycott them. They're a tiny studio made of people who put so much of their life and money into this. Some cite their 5 million budget as a reason why they *should* have been able to make the full game.

But to my regret, it's a lesser title than it's predecessors.\nThe collectables are no longer experience points, but will count toward unlocking new levels. This also means you'll have all available skills at the start.\nThey made the move from 2.5D to full 3D.  Full being a bit much said. It still behaves like the sidescroller this franchise has been know as. And with 3D, the problem of depth arises, most present with floating objects and enemies.\nThis game is quite shorter than what the franchise is know for, with the ending demanding a followup.\n\nBut this doesn't mean other new things are bad. Amadeus finally has a decent combat ability, and being able to move while levitating is a nice addition too, even though his abilities have been reduced to a single box. Zoya can now tie her rope to objects. In both I see possibility to be used in the old 2.5D style. In addition, all characters can perform walljumps, which I'm fairly ok with.\n\nIn the end, would I be willing to pay full price? Not in it's current state I'm afraid. What would I consider a good price? Well, I bought it at 50% off, and what I got was well worth the price. Frozenbyte titles are known for their insanely deep discounts. Trine 1 and 2 have seen 85-90% cuts, and it hurst me to see such great games go so deep.

There was no "puzzle" solving or anything of the like, it was a "Oh look at our pretty backgrounds, here we will move the camera around for you even if it doesn't help you progess through the part you are at because the path you need to take is in the foreground, but our background is so pretty" game. They also did some crap where they gave you a "full game" and only put 1/3 of the story in it. So now I have to wait for and buy the DLC/other game inorder to finish the, not even that interesting, story. Also as you can see, this game was ridiculously short. And about 2 of the 5 hours that I have in this game probably weren't in the main story, rather that time was spent in little mini-quests that had no purpose. Another horrible aspect was the bland combat. Trine 2 had a great system where you could upgrade your character to better suit your purposes and have a little bit of extra fun, and it also made all characters combat viable, in this, each character has 1 kind of attack (except the knight who technically has 3, but only one is particularly useful) and the theif and wizard are completly useless in combat. All the wizard can do is try to navigate his box around the convoluted camera angles and slam it on enemies, and the theif has to attempt to land arrows on the enemies with the same problem, renedring them both useless. Tl;DR: This is a watered down Trine 2, play that and the first game instead, ignore this incomplete title.","January 6","false","5.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I often look at how much money games are making and I generally don't buy things that seem like they are being overpaid for their work. So do not buy it until the price reflects quality. Lacks the vibrance trine 1 and 2 do, but if you don't let the bugs and questionable moments get to you then it is a fun game with new mechanics. I say 6.5/10\n\nBut the biggest problem I have are the fixed position of the camera angles i am thinking the whole time 'if they could just be a few degrees up..' I know those of you reading this are saying 'im a gamer my skill will compensate for these'...cuz thats what i thought lol. But dont kid yourself,the camera angles are fixed almost parallel to the floor like it is the old 2.5D style so it messes with your depth perception, especially playing this wizard. They mess you up all the time on every aspect of gameplay, my friends and I were constantly walking off misleading edges.\n\nStill had fun playing it with friends because we didn't let the bugs get to us but sometimes the bugs cause frustration. Only played online co-op so I am not sure if the bugs are present in single player...but why would you play any of the trines single player? They claim 5.4 million dollar cost because of the new 3D, and say to have a developed a longer story would've taken 15 million that they didn't have.

The environments are beautiful and have improved greatly from its predecessors, traditionally Trine and Trine 2 had the 2.5D prespective with the camera, Trine 3 on the other hand sticks with the 2.5D perspective but also delves into the 3D aspect where the camera moves freely\n\nMany Trine fans were not happy with this transistion, personally I am okay with it, the camera now shows more of the beautiful environments which I am not complaining. However, the camera is annoying and sometimes where I try to reach a certain platform, the camera makes me think I can reach the platform but when I jump to the platform, I fall and die... which can be really frustrating!\n\nThe story is okay not as brilliant as the previous two Trine games, but I'll come back to this later in the review...\n\nThe controls are okay but Trine 3 really plays better with a controller rather than the previous games where you can easily play with a keyboard\n\nThe missions, the game now introduces a hub where you can freely move around and play around with the missions, there are also side missions where you can collect additional shards. I hate this new system, Trine and Trine 2 were heavily narrativally driven and never had this type of hub. Trine 3 on the other hand you have to play these additional side missions as well as replay the main missions to collect the required amount of shards to unlock the next mission\n\nThe side missions are incredibly annoying and I hated every single one, I have the feeling that the developers just added these side missions so that they can extend the length of the story, and I'll come to the length of the story very shortly\n\nThe voice acting is still as brilliant as the previous two games and the same voice actors from Trine and Trine 2 make a return which made me really happy! The music is okay, its not as amazing as Trine and Trine 2's music was, Trine 3 it just feels like rinse and repeat the same music, over and over again...\n\nIn Trine and Trine 2, there was a lot of character development with the three characters; Pontius - a knight, Zoya - an archer, Amadeus - a wizard, and in Trine and Trine 2 you had more abilities to use that in Trine 3. Amadeus had more wizard abilites than in Trine 3! In Trine 3, you just make one box with one control... in Trine and Trine 2 you had the ability to make movements with your mouse and either a box or a plank would be created, Trine 3 doesn't have that ability, very dissapointed...\n\nNow, to the length... I cannot understand why it is this short... and with a cliffhanger ending too!? The boss battle is one of the weakest I have seen in the Trine series and the cliffhanger ending made me feel like the developers said, "Yeah, we want to tell you the rest, but that's it for today...", the ending is so ridiculous that I am going to ruin it for you without adding a spoiler cover over it... the Trine was split into four pieces and scattered across the world that the Trine series takes place in\n\nYou manage to find one piece in one of the chapters then you find the last piece after defeating the most stupidist boss battle possible, then the three characters say that they have two more pieces to find, they walk off and... THAT'S IT! My mouth was left wide open when the credits started rolling, I was astonished and amazed at how short this game is! Thank god I did not pay full price for it...\n\nI cannot understand what Frozenbyte were doing with Trine 3, they literally made a copy and paste of the previous Trine games, add a few bits here and there and not improve on the other gameplay elements. I am very upset that Trine 3 was not as good as previous Trine games, and this is the first Trine game in which I am not going to recommend... its difficult as I love the Trine series but sadly, they ruined my hype for it with Trine 3\n\nIf you are a fan of the Trine series, then I would say buy this at a very heavily discounted price. If you haven't played the previous Trine games and you are interested in playing the Trine series, play the previous two and don't even bother touching this game... they are heavily discounted anyway\n\nA real shame...\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED :(","November 28, 2015","false","5.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A physics puzzle game that I can play with friends because it has a multiplayer mode while relaxing on the couch because it has controller support? Hell yeah.\n\nI have played the first 4 or 5 levels now, together with two friends, the way every Trine game is supposed to be played.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nYou control one of three characters: The Knight, The Thief, The Mage. Each of them has different capabilities. The Knight has a sword and shield for combat, and can glide through the air while using his shield as a parachute. The Thief can shoot arrows, and use a grappling hook. The Mage can conjure boxes and move objects around.\n\nYou can switch characters at any time, although for those of us who played Trine 1 and 2 there is a "classic" mode, in which you can only control one of the three and two friends pick up the other two.\n\nAlso, the leveling system has been removed. Every ability for every character is available from the start. I would argue that the leveling system was somewhat arbitrary, but some people will surely miss it.\n\nThe Levels are intricate enough to be interesting, with hidden secrets and beautiful design. The general rule is "go right, look left", as it is for every sidescrolling game, but the 3D graphics make for interesting transitions and effects.\n\nThe 3D character of this game is the cause of multiple problems though, which include characters going offscreen and getting stuck somewhere, solutions to puzzles or hidden secrets that are not actually hard to find take a lot of time to find because they are simple off screen, and aiming the Thief's bow as well as swinging from her grappling hook get somewhat of a challenge in itself.\nLetting the Mage move something can also create some problems, since the camera shows the side view of the landscape while the Mage can actually move objects in 3D space.\n\nAlso: Different sized boxes, planks and triangles are missing completely from the Mage's repertoire, which reduces his usefulness by quite a lot.\n\nControls overall feel slightly wonky, as the goal of puzzles seems to be more of a "wiggle a thing into the right place" more than "let's find an actual solution to a physical problem".\n\nEDIT: I wrote in an earlier review that the game does not support controller for player 1, the issue is now fixed, as I suggested it would be upon release. Good job, guys!\n\n\nGraphics\n\nThose of us who have played Trine 1 and 2 will notice immediately: This game is completely 3D. And: The game is beautiful. In terms of graphics, this is definitely a big step up from Trine 1 and a moderate step up from Trine 2. I will ignore the problems with the camera in this section, since they are not strictly graphics related, and just say that I still enjoy the Trine art style. The way the levels are designed (graphically), they sure are some eye candy.\n\n\nStory\n\nThe story is more functional than believable, more meant to drive the gameplay than tell something interesting, but has it's funny moments in almost every piece of storytelling that happens throughout the game. And despite my resentment against games with "functional" story, I did enjoy what Trine 3 showed me so far.\n\nThe game is short though. The story is just a couple chapters/levels long.\n\n\nMultiplayer!\n\nWorks reliable, at least. Pieces of story that were 1-player-only before now spawn in the other two players as well. Characters do not need to be switched awkwardly via respawning. You can request a switch by pressing a button and a player can answer your call. I haven't tried online play yet, since I happen to have people living nearby who also enjoy Trine, but I might suggest trying that out, since it might resolve some camera issues if you have three people on screen who go different directions.\n\nI noticed that there is very little helping each other. Before, players could stand on top of the Knight if he raises his shield for an additional height boost. That is not possible anymore. The Mage can no longer move boxes that players are standing on. The Thief never had an ability to help people, which fit perfectly, because she is the selfish one ;)\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\nI would love to, but I can't wholeheartedly say that Trine 3 is a step up from Trine 2. The controls simply don't feel that smooth yet, and the 3D aspect introduces a whole new set of problems, especially when playing locally with multiple people (Damn you, camera!). If you have played Trine 1 and 2, I would suggest picking this up just to complete the series. If you haven't, playe Trine 1 and 2 first.\n\nOverall, I will give this game a Thumbs Down. It shows potential, and is fun to play in parts. But taking a step in a new direction also means facing new problems that the developers weren't able to solve entirely. The reduced ability pool of the characters, as well as the kind of puzzles that appeared in the game makes me hope that Trine 4 will do better, instead of making me want to play more of Trine 3.\n\n\nThis is Luparax, signing out.","December 14, 2015","false","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you're looking to completing the game 100%, you're looking at maybe 8-10 hours of effective gameplay, tops. As vibrant as the levels feel, they feel quite clumsy gameplay wise, and replaying them isn't probably going to be a joyful experience. Especially forcing replaying levels if you're missing any golden "trineangels" to unlock challenge maps and even main story levels feels like the developers had to figure out some way to artificially lengthen the game.\n\nTwo of the three characters have seen massive simplification, and not really for the better. Zoya (the thief) can now attach two objects together with a rope, but she can now only grapple and swing from pre-placed hooks. She has also lost the different elemental arrows.\n\nAmadeus (the wizard) has the ability to slam levitated objects straight down, but he can only summon one mechanical cube. His levitation now has to happen in 3D space with the mouse controlling height and length and the mouse scroll *slowly* controls depth. Amadeus is practically a forced character in a couple of fights where he has to use his slam attack with precise placement and timing, which is extremely difficult in Trine 3's awkward, half-baked control scheme.\n\nPontius can float with his shield, and he has a jumping slam attack and a shield charge, but the shield charge controls unpredictably at times. Pontius was mainly a fighting character in the previous games, but now I think I played as him most of the time.\n\nIf you absolutely need more Trine after playing the previous two games, buy this only at a hefty sale. Otherwise, don't bother.","December 22, 2015","false","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You would think a full 3D game would hinder the background graphic quality in comparison with its 2D predecessors, but that does not happen;\nThe story has more depth, and expands into things the previous games seemed to ignore completely and left me curious about;\nThe puzzles are more complex, if not actually harder. At least I had more to do than "blow this up" or "jump this high" and that's a win for me;\nThere are now side stages where you are in control of only one character. Great for practicing the abilities that had to be retooled for 3D, or just for a fix of monster whacking;\nPlayers are now able to restart a stage from any checkpoint, and view at which section their missing trineangles are. Frustrations gone;\nAmadeus is finally useful in boss battles and not only a cheap device to get through the stages.\nCons:\nThere is no difficulty setting, and the game feels overall too easy. They also got rid of character skills, so there are way more limitations on how to do things;\nThere are still some bugs, such as characters/objects going straight through platforms under certain circumstances, trineangles not disappearing after being picked up, and players getting stuck out of the map in multiplayer;\nDepth of field is non existent. I can't count how many times I 1) jumped to my death because I couldn't tell the difference between stage and background 2) spun around monsters/bosses whacking the wind because I couldn't for the love of me figure out where in the map they were 3) had to restart a puzzle because something was just a little bit off;\nThe game is incomplete. This isn't a complaint about the game being short, or the "money per hour of fun had" measure people seem to like. The story doesn't have an end. Simple as that. And it cuts off right when it starts to get good.\nAll in all, there is room for improvement, a few urgent fixes that should be taken care of, and I hope the conclusion to the story doesn't come in the form of paid DLC, but Trine 3 is a nice game that's fun to play alone or with friends. It may be short, but there is a much larger variety of things to do, and great replay value as always.","January 2","true","11.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Moreover, everything is too easy to solve.  Basically you have to collect all the triangles and that's it.  Not much boss fight, no puzzles, no creatures with special characterisitcs...\n\nP.S.

There are no more real puzzles in the game, and very linear levels. No more skill tree as well, no more levitating monsters, conjuring more objects or planks, no more hammer or fire sword, and no more ice/fire/explosive arrows or stealth movement.\nFor me, the worst part is the fact that you have to collect pyramids(orbs) in order to progress through the game, and of course, the ending, where the story should have continued.\nThis could have been great, Trine 2 has improved so much from the first game, but here, it has gone backwards, and that makes me sad, I expected better from Frozenbyte.","March 22","false","12.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drachenhexe/recommended/319910/","drachenhexe","Dragonwitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drachenhexe/","514 products in account","While Trine 3 is still a decent game, and expands on the base gameplay in a few interesting ways, it is by far the worst of the series.  It's move to a 3D environment unfortunetaly cause some serious issues that can make gameplay rather frustrating or, in some cases, broken.\n\nSince you can move front to back now as well as left to right and up and down this causes an issue with proper alignment.  Trying to jump on something can be a trying experience because often you look like you're lined up with an object but when you jump you realize that it's further from the front of the screen than you are and you miss...\n\nAlso, the physics in the game can really spazz out on you when manipulating objets, especially wizard boxes.  Quite often when levitating a box it will suddenly accelerate, sometimes in random directions, making control impossible until you drop it and levitate it again.\n\nSome of the environmental puzzles require physical manipulation as well, and while moving them only has minor issues, anything you need to rope can wonk out on you causing the item attached to the rope to just twitch and jerk like it's getting an electrical shock.  On at least a couple of times the objects twitched and and got stuck in a place that made it near impossible to progress because it was right in the way and it got stuck to where we couldn't manipulate it.\n\nAside from the bugs caused by the total 3D environment there is lot missing from the game that we've become used to in Trine and Trine 2.  One is that the art work suffers because of the 3D environments.  The color, the lighting effects, the overall style, makes this game not quite as good looking as its predicessors.\n\nThe game also comes up short from its predicessors by not having any kind of upgrade system.  The wizard can only make boxes now..no planks or floating platforms.  No specialty arrows for the thief, and no special attacks fro the warrior (I miss that big thrown mallet!).\n\nThe game isn't a complete loss however.  It still has its effective narration, its story is quite good I think, and its characters haven't changed in their personalities leaving the dialogue still at a minimum, but humorous and lively all the same. Perhaps it's best addition is that players can all be the sam echaracter now if they so choose.  If each player is playing teh same character each will have its own color.  Even with the color difference though it can still be confusing tryig to figure out which wizard/thief/warrior you are when another is standing right next to you.  I must admit though it has resulted in some moments that were quite amusing.\n\nLevel design is also quite brilliant at times, with the extra dimension adding a lot to puzzle design and solutions but adding to gameplay snafus mentioned earlier.  There are a couple of levels dedicated to an alternate look and feel which are very nicely done, but are too few and too short to fully enjoy.   None of the levels we encountered so far have been of any significant difficulty.\n\nAnother addition to the game is somewhat of a world map where you can navigate the chapter as you see fit, going back to replay any level at any time.  There are also side stories off the main path that offer short little scenarios usually focused on one of the three heroes.  These short little levels offer a small break from the main story and add a little bit of back story to the heroes and sometimes some the better puzzles in the game.  There's a few references to other games scattered throught the game as well.\n\nStill, in the end, my friend and and I found ourselves longing for the likes of Trine and Trine 2 for their more basic (non-3D) design (that is, less frustrating navigation through the game world), their fuller play mechanics with experience and upgrades, and their richer, brighter, and more charming color and lighting.\n\nI really can't recommend this game because, while I don't think you'll completely regret playing this game, all it will do is make you remember that Trine and Trine 2 really are as good as you remeber and you'll end up wishing you were replaying them instead of this one.","February 1","false","6.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are some new mechanics (for example Zoya can now attach 2 objects together), and in general, this game it is a step in the right direction. But there are a few problems.\n\nFirst off, the game is now in 3D. If you are a 2D purist you will not like this. Personally I found out that the perspective can get in the way a bit, but I got used to it, and had a lot of fun with it. The 3D-ness opens up some new possibilities and new kinds of puzzles which is great.\n\nSecond, a huuuuge missed opportunity. The rest of this paragraph contains a minor spoiler, consider yourself warned. At a certain point our characters are taken into a book. This would have been a great opportunity to take the game back to it's roots and give us some 2D puzzles, but they kept it 3D. I don't know why, but this bothers me. I see it as a huge wasted opportunity.\n\nLast, and the most important of all. The game has no ending. Apparently the developer didn't have enough money to finish the game, so they left it without an ending to the story, leaving us in a cliffhanger. This makes the game shorter than it should have been. They promised some kind dlc to complete this in the future (maybe for free, maybe not) but so far nothing has come out - at least, not that I know of.\n\nDespite its flaws it is still a very enjoyable game.","May 29","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ill tell you an honest review why i think the game is worth trying and what to expect of this one. First of all: i would suggest buying this on a sale since i my opinion its not worth the total price.\n\nJust as the previous games the game still looks really great, detailed. The music is nice and relaxing while playing. The achievments are not really hard to achieve but there is still some challenge during the puzzles. The boss fight was surprisely harder then i expected. I did it in co-op, which made a slithly easier. But i challenge you to do it in single player. Warning: you will need patience xD  I had fun playing this in co-op just like all the other games.\n\nI found the 3D aspect not really a nice upgrade. I prefered to have it 2d. I died alot jumping and having problems to see where i would land. The story is shorter than trine 2 (i played it 100% in +- 9hours). They reduced the abilities of the heroes to only 1. The combat for me was much easier with pontius cause zoya in 3d was harder for me to shoot my arrows.\nThe end of the story was like: wait this is the ending? There must be a trine 4.. So really weird ending but promising in the same time. I hope they remove the 3d aspect and just focus on 2d like in trine 2 (where they did a really good job).\n\nlike i said before buy this game in sale and have some fun with co-op. If you keep in mind this game is not as good as trine 2, you will still have alot of fun.","May 18","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are beautiful and it has it's charm like the previous games.\n\nIt's important to note that the 3D is sometimes cumbersome to navigate in, considering that you can't control the camera whatsoever. Furthermore, there are no skills to be learned, and obviously, there is a massive cliffhanger. All this most likely due to the fact that the game turned out to be too costly too late in the development, so T3 had to be released until money had ran out.\n\nSo, even though there are numerous drawbacks, as I wrote in the beginning, it's still worth it to buy and play T3 in hope that the developers will continue the series which we love.","May 22","true","10.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Although the transition to 3D has resulted in a few quirks in the controls it still plays like a Trine game, complete with wonderous visuals and fairytale story. There are few complaints; namely the puzzles aren't really solvable in as many ways as previous games and the wizard isn't quite as versatile as he once was. The big one is the length. Far too short. At time of completion, I feel as though the story has been only half told. Aside from these gripes, I'm loving the rope mechanics implemented with Zoya and the resultant puzzles; as well as the epic, beautiful environments Trine is so well known for, extended in 3D with more interesting backdrops.\n\nAll in all, a bit short, but still fun.

If we separated too much one or both of us would end up off screen unable to figure out how to get back on.  In the previous versions, if a person was left behind they would respawn at the location of the player who was further ahead.  We were never able to trigger that action in this game.  What was worse is when both players were off screen and neither of us could figure out how to get back in frame.\n\nWe ran into this problem multiple times and it was frustrating to the point where we both gave up.\n\nI was really hoping Tine 3 was in the same vein as the first two but no dice.","August 24, 2015","false","1.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Arri Pulkkinen once again delivers.\n2) Puzzles are clever. The machinery of the world essentially consists of rotationary and straight-line movement elements, and you will learn how to operate these with each of your characters during the tutorial and early levels easily. In the challenge levels you then use the same methods to achieve unusual effects; this is perhaps strongest in Pontius' machinery challenges, where he needs to move CARTS on tracks using stomps and bashes.\n3) "Boss battles" were also designed well. Be it the giant automaton at the middle of level 2, or the final boss in level 8, or the semi-bosses which start appearing in level 3, they are cleverly designed so that it's not so much about quick fingers, as it is about smart brains.\n4) General feel of the levels, aesthetics of the environments: The maps vary greatly in their graphics, similarly to Trine 2. I particularly love the forest level, but essentially every level is clearly built with a lot of love and it shows.\n","August 30, 2015","true","15.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","2"

It is every bit as gorgeous as its predecessors, with amazing music as well, but while the art for this game was spot on, the gameplay and game design choices left much to be desired. I played this game with two friends who were also fans of the previous games, and they too were let down by this game. The fact that I played with them was all that made it bearable - there are things that would have been ludicrously difficult to do alone, and the joking and bickering with each other and just generally socializing was the source of most of the fun; as a single player game, Trine 3 would not have had enough merit of its own to keep me playing.\n\nTrine 3 marks the transition from 2D to 3D for this series, and like so many before it, it only suffers for the change. For one thing, while they added a third dimension and all the additional complexities to the controls that this entails, it added very little to the actual puzzles and gameplay, which remain, for the most part, the same 2D side scrolling platforming as before. Only now, there's a chance you'll misjudge your Z coordinate and jump BEHIND the platform (and fall to your death) instead of ONTO it. It also makes hitting things with arrows more difficult than in the past. The controls for this new 3D environment were often wonky and awkward.\n\nBut worse is the fact that this game has more bugs than a beehive. Even after a long Early Access period, which should have helped iron out the glitches, the game is clearly unfinished. It feels like a beta. Zoya's ropes would occasionally disappear, completely at random. Sometimes while she was hanging on them. Sometimes while they were binding an object that someone else was standing on. Clipping issues abound, and sometimes characters or ropes would simply pass through objects. On occasion, characters (usually Zoya and Pontius, though this was probably due to our Amadeus being the host) would simply teleport some yards away, leading to a chorus of confused cries on our voice chat - and at one point this happened in the middle of an unsolved puzzle, leaving us with no way to move forward and making it very difficult to backtrack and get the puzzle solved up to the point we were standing at. Our Pontius may have once or twice (though I never witnessed it) fallen through the ground. One time we somehow ended up with two Amadeuses and one Zoya, with one Amadeus being nonfunctional, necessitating a level reboot. Another time, Pontius died but his spirit didn't appear, so he couldn't be resurrected, again necessitating a level restart. Sometimes taking certain actions near certain objects would cause objects and even level geometry to fly off into space. At one point, where there are two platforms that counteract each other's weight, with one rising when the other falls, Pontius managed to ground-slam one of the platforms into disconnecting from its rail and hanging in the sky high above.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, the game's actual design is also poor. There are only seven (or eight; I didn't double count, but there were less than ten) levels and a series of mini-levels with little to do with the plot. To make the game longer, the levels were locked with trinagle requirements. Unlike in the past, where plot progression was enough, you now need to have collected a large number of the meaningless collectible goodies in order to even access later levels. This lead to some backtracking later on, as we had skipped many trinangles deemed too risky to attempt getting, usually due to bugginess making the area particularly dangerous (e.g. "Do we really want to risk sending Zoya to swing over there when her ropes are so prone to just vanishing, and then possibly have to recover her soul from some awkward place?"). But even with this backtracking, we finished the game in 5 hours.\n\nAnd then we didn't even get to finish the plot. We joked along the way that we'd get to the end only to see "To Be Continued in Trine 3 Episode 2!", but we didn't once dream that they'd actually DO that! Needless to say, when the credits rolled, there was ranting over voice chat along the lines of "What?! That's it?! THEY DIDN'T EVEN FINISH THE STORY?!"\nSeriously, you fight a dragon that comes out of nowhere, is unrelated to anything that has been going on, and is never explained, and then the game ends, with a message about how the story will continue in the next game.\n\nSuch a shame that I have to say this, but I can't recommend this game, despite loving the first two. This one is simply full of holes.","August 22, 2015","false","5.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I couldn't have wished for more on that side.\nSecondly, this is a fun game regardless of length. Multiplayer is extremely fun too.\n\nNow, speaking of its length. Many people find this to be a downside because it's 22$. All developers make mistakes in some way or another, and while Frozenbyte could have forseen it, I do not blame them.\nAt first, the Cliffhanger really bugged me: Why even put a final cutscene there?\nThen, I started to realise that it's not that bad after all. After all, when you get a cliffhanger like this, you start wondering what would have happened. You think about it, perhaps fantasize about how the rest of the story would go. This makes Trine 3, with all it's flaws, still a memorable game. It looks great, there's plenty of jokes, the area and puzzle design, although not hard, is still fun.\nDon't let the bad reception and cliffhanger get to you: It still is a great game, that leave syou thinking about the plot afterwards. Literally.\nAnd to Frozenbyte, sorry it had to go like this. I still have faith you can make up for it one day. After all, all your games so far have been enjoyable.

If it was 9.99 or 14.99 I might recommend it.  But the game is so short and the story isn't complete.  There is a big cliffhanger at the end.  Also another reason I don't recommend this game is that the developers are not going to finish the game.  They are going to leave it as is.  So its really not an early access.  It only took me about 1/4 of the time it took me to play the other Trine games.  The developers try to made the game longer by locking the stages up until you collect enough of the collectable.  So you have to go back and do some of the sidequest before you can get to the last level.  It didn't take long for me to get enough to unlock the last level.  If you are looking for any rpg elements there are none.  The skills you get in the beginning is what you get throughout the game.  Lots of puzzle/platforming like the other 2 Trines though.  The 3d aspect of the game takes a little to get use to.  Lots of the puzzles/platforming are in a 2d plane though.  Lots of the game is moving left to right and up and down.  Not really a 3d game.  There are a few areas where you will be moving into the foregound or into the background.  But most of the game plays like a 2d game.  The good things about this game is the visual, music, and voice acting.  I would wait until there is a very big sale on this game before you buy it.","August 27, 2015","false","4.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Maybe things have been patched up, because to me there doesn't really seem to be anything that is bad. It's a little different from the other Trine games but I like the 3D aspect. The "personal" challenges (ones that you play with only one character) are a bit hit or miss but most of them are fun. The game is pretty short (so was Trine 1, but I can imagine people got a little upset) but very fun and I think most Trine fans will enjoy it.\nAlso the game looks so beautiful!","November 7, 2015","true","8.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I'm amazed that so early into early access everything already works acceptably well. I really loved Zoya's rope mechanics.\n\nGoing 3D is the biggest change and it kept me suspicious until I got to try it. I was especially worried how the introduced complexity will work with my inexperienced friends. I'm confident to say that Frozenbyte did wonderful work. The puzzles are deeper and the platforming works most of the time, but I had to admit I had my perspective challenged moments. Luckily death is never such a big deal in Trine games. It's really fun to explore all hidden secrets in a level and the attention to detail is staggering. Hopefully the high standards in level design are kept all the way to the final release.\n\nSome complaints so far:\n- Falling through walls happens quite often when jumping in tight places.\n- If you're playing the same character with your buddy they should have different colors.\n- Characters get lost outside of view too much. Teleporting more often or zooming out could work.","April 26, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The shift to 3D was not a bad idea, however the developers where way in over their heads. The simplified character skills (no experience gain, no talent buying) resulted in a boring experience, with Asmodeus (mage) being completely redundant and basically not worth playing at all.\n\nTrine 3 is a step backwards from the second game. There is only one boss, the story telling took a huge blow, as after each level the players are thrown back into a world map, and the puzzles are incredibly easy.\n\nOne reason you might want to pick this game up is the beautiful graphics, with the "book level" purely phenomenal.\n\nAll in all, I sadly believe there are more disadventages  to Trine 3 then positives so it is a "No recommend".","August 30, 2015","false","6.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The artwork, soundtrack and cinematography are still top notch, showcasing production values that I’ve come to expect from the series. The core mechanics and gameplay are still there, just streamlined a bit in order to reduce friction. However the game is clearly only a third of the creator’s original vision, with numerous levels and story left undeveloped, never to be explored by us gamers. It’s really quite unfortunate as parts of Trine 3 we’ve got are just incredible but that quality has obviously come at a cost. Hopefully this isn’t the death of the series as it would be a real shame to see it go just as Frozenbyte was reaching its peak.\n\nRead my full review here: https://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2015/09/01/trine-3-artefacts-of-power-a-whole-new-dimension/","September 3, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I already knew it. Still, I expected something more... simply because the content is not enough!\n\nLet's start with the good things:\nAmazing level design. They improved over the already gorgeous Trine 2, making the world more vibrant and dynamic. Moreover, it runs smooth while looking good even in a 2012 laptop. Playing at 1080p whould be great.\n3D platform. Yeah, you can move not ony left-right, but far-close too. This opens a lot of possibilities. They should've taken more advantage of this, though.\nZoya's rope. Now you can use it for puzzle solving. Though you can hook it just on some specific targets, which sucks.\nNow tha bads:\nEasy. No, really, I consider myself a semi-casual gamer. Still, this was freaking easy! I completed it in 6 hours. And I mean ALL of it, every optional level, every collectible item. I simply could not die. I wanted to. Sort of it.\nNo difficulty settings. This was a great feature of previous games. You could complete the game on easy mode and move on, or you could turn up the difficulty and play a very challenging game. Now you must stick on easy mode, because it's the only one.\nCharacter building. This is bad, because it doesn't exist. I expected to see an improved tree for weapon upgrades, instead they completely removed it. They also removed the additional weapons that you could get upgrading your characters.\nPuzzles. They are too simple. And this makes me sad, because the introduction of 3D could allow to make some amazing puzzles.\nEnemies. Where are they?\nSimplified. I already mentioned Zoya's rope. You can keep you breath underwater for a ridiculous amount of time. Health recovery is too fast. If a character dies, you can revive him/her immediatly, wherever you are. I can keep on.\nLore. Too less, too simple. The storyline doesn't catch my attention at all.\nAt last, why am I not recommending this? Well, for all the above reasons and because it does not worth anything above 10-15€. I would recommend to get it for cheap in a bundle, though, but don't expect more than the average mobile game.","May 27","false","5.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

With its interactive game-play, colorful graphics and pretty much unlimited range possibilities in roaming and explring the maps, Trine 3 outmatches far & beyond its previous two parts, making it probably the funnest game there is for playing, multiplayer with your friends and have some lol-time together!

The game is beautiful... BUT you are quickly placed into areas that are dark and boring and don't add anything to the game. Then there is the problem of unlocking levels. You have to repeat previous levels over and over again to unlock the next levels and that doesn't work with a game like trine when it is 3D. The perspective is too variable so you never know where you are making it very easy to fall off which can be incredibly annoying on the side missions where a death is an instant restart. The next problem is the general spaztic nature of the game at times. If there is a ledge you need to climb, 9 times out of 10 as amadeus you can skip a puzzle and spam jump at the wall until the hitbox bugs out or you find a ledge and this defeats the entire point of a platform puzzle game.\n\nAll in all, around 4/10 a disappointing game that had so much potential.","September 27, 2015","false","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game therefore is not yet complete. It has a few missing features and menu options that are not yet written.\n\nAnyone familiar with the trine series of games and has enjoyed them will not be disappointed with Trine 3, the artifacts of power.   The 3dish side-scroller idea takes some getting used to, but within minutes you'll get the hang of it and start enjoying the new play style.\n\nThe side scrolling you're familair with from Trine 2 is still pretty much the same, except that now, when you press the up or down keys you will go deeper or closer into the enviroment.  Even so, there are times where the entire environment rotates to display a whole new landscape.  This was a pleasant surprise as this makes clear that the 2d landscape is actually 3d and not necessarily limited to just left, right, up and down movements.\n\nSeveral of the mechanics of each character has been improved or changed slightly.  In Trine 2, The Wizard was not able to stand on a created box and hover it, but if he put something between himself and that box, he could hover the box and therefore himself.\n\nIn Trine 3, this loop hole has been closed.  Not only can the wizard no longer take advantage of this loop hole to carry himself anywhere; He also can't do it to toher characters.  It seems that objects that are being manipulated by one character are no longer affected by the abilities of another.\n\nThis is not aas bad as it might at first sound.  It forces the player to learn to use the characters abilities as they were intended, rather than using loopholes to get through some levels.   The player ultimately learns to better control the character, but loses the option of "Cheating" past an obstacle, leaving only the rage-quit option available on some tough levels.\n\nEven so, it is still fun and enjoyable and a great addition to the under-valued series.\n\nHaving said that, there aren't very many levels yet, and the "Challenge" levels are short and limited to playing the thief.  The challenge levels end abruptly at the amusement park, which I assume the develops left there to test the mechanics of the game, and allow early access players something to play with while waiting for the new levels and features.\n\nA glitch on the final screen of the chanllenges allowed me to walk through the mouth of the snake  and into the walls of the level, where my character was forever lost and unable to escape without restarting the level.  I'm sure this will be found and corrected before the next patch.\n\nIf you would prefer to wait for the whole experience and leave the testing for some one else, waiting might be a better option.\n\nPaying for early access right now may not be worthwhile for some, but if you have enjoyed the Trine series or you feel it is under valued and you'd like to help the developers; by all means go ahead and get in now.\n\nPersonally, I can't wait for the next levels to be released.  Thumbs up.\n","April 26, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They have delivered exactly what I like in this kind of game - bright colours, satisfying combat, some fun dialogue, and not puzzles that are not too difficult because I usually play games like this to wind down and not brain too hard!\n\nTrine 3 is definitely more of the same, with the added bonus of having a new dimension to work with!\n\nThere are some issues for me. Particularly the controls now do not feel quite so responsive and it is very easy to hit the wrong key when moving, climbing up ledges just seems a bit jerky, and it is easy to go in the wrong direction.\n\nAmadeus' control of objects gave me some pause too. Unless I have missed something the only way to move an object towards or away from the camera is to walk it in the appropriate direction, while you can move it left and right while standing still. Is there a control for this? (Hmm, maybe the scroll wheel like Zoya uses for controling rope length).\n\nMy final criticism is some of the delivery, particularly a few lines from Victoria Kruger just sounded phoned in. I hope for better enthusiasm in the delivery later in the game.\n\nHowever, despite these points, I definitely recommend Trine 3. There are new abilities, like Zoya being able to tie objects and pull them and fasten them to other objects. Amadeus' box creation has been simplified by having a single hotkey rather than trying to create boxes while being attacked. But the best (so far) was when I first saw Pontius grab an enemy in mid jump and slam them down on their head! The Boss battle (I have played to just past the first boss) was fun and having the extra dimension did made the fight feel much more dynamic.\n\nCons:\nMovement controls somewhat odd (at least for me)\nCamera in some areas\nLedge grabbing could be better\nSome line delivery\n\nPros:\nGameplay\nStory (what I have seen so far interests me so I want to find out more)\nColours (so damn pretty!)\nDialogue\nMovement and combat feel fluid (despite also being in the cons list I do believe the movement can only be improved and it is by no means at all broken, just in need of tweaking).\n\nFinal thoughts - this is how an Early Access game should be delivered. Something with real gameplay, nearly completely functional and with few rough edges to iron out. Frozenbyte have done well here and I am really looking forward to the finished product!","April 30, 2015","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

It's inexpensive, available on all kinds of platforms and one of the best and most beautiful games you will ever play. The art, music and gameplay are all tightened to the 9s and it's charm hasn't worn off one bit in the years it's been available.\n\nTrine 3 is taking the old 2-d platform model and adding a 2.5/3-D component to the lovingly crafted setpieces. ultimately the levels still move forward in the same way, and the camera is fixed, always providing you with the best storybook-quality view that made previous Trine games such a feast for the eyes.\n\nOverall, the 3-D experiment is a resounding success:\n- Pontius is surprisingly agile, can wall-jump and glide with his shield. He's also fast as heck. I expect we'll need to see some slight nerfing for him, because he can jump higher and longer than Zoya now, especially using his no-cooldown dash move as a starter. He is pretty much  invincible in the Goblin combat sequences in this Early Access. He's got some clipping issues with his arm and placement of the shield, but these are all things i am sure will be fixed. While he's missing the hammer from previous entries so far, he obviously has had a lot of loving care put into his move set. His new ground-pound stomp (jump + duck) is really fun. He even uses his shield\nto propel his heavy self through water!\n\n- Zoya's archery skills are coming through pretty well in 3-d, although she can't aim upward unless she needs to for a puzzle reason - there were a bit of doing the dance of the secret square to get a proper angle based on where she was standing. In general, her controls didn't feel quite as responsive as one might hope. Unlike previous Trine entries, Zoya can't swing from nearly any cieling or ledge, only from defined points, usually marked with a metal ring. She also uses the ropes to solve puzzles by establishing a length of rope by spooling and unspooling it, then yanking things into place and tying them off. This got a little confusing in parts when i had about six useless loose ropes on the screen, but again, i think this kind of clean-up is what we can expect by the time the game is ready. Zoya is also lovingly animated with gorgeous transitions and watching her move is a real joy. the flowing robe is, in my opinion, a bit too much. i would seriously consider putting zoya in some tight pants and reducing the length of the skirt a tad, because it literally went up over her hood a few times in my playthrough. Hilarious, but hardly heroic. it will also solve any awkward upskirts that occur when she is sneaking. Zoya's wall jumping and climbing and some of the new rope puzzles are great, but it was frustrating that in the end she was a less successful jumper than Pontius, especially since she can't grapple to nearly anywhere, zoya feels more ground-bound than she ever has.\n\n- Amadeus feels the least complete of the three so far. gone are the charming "draw a box or a line" mechanics of previous Trine entries, Amadeus has just gone full-on telekentic master now. The demo didn't give quite as much of an impression as to how he'll be used long term in the game, but. He can still summon a box and place it to help him platform. His animations look awesomely goofy but he's also come into his own in terms of confidence, and his new robes are slick as hell. It is entirely possible that the heroes will gain new moves and upgrades as with Trine 2, so who knows what kind of magical surprises are in Amadeus' future?\n\n- Once you unite the three heroes, you'll get some switch-on-the-fly gameplay leading up to a boss fight. This will, of course, be what the meat and potatoes of the game will be, and I can't wait. The level design and art teams for Trine 3 have already delivered incredible transitions and surprises waiting beind doorways of all sorts of angles, and secrets to be discovered. The new save points are beyond gorgeous, and I'm excited to learn more about the game's villain!\n\n- The game's boss fight was a wonderful display of how depth will be used in fighting the huge monsters introduced in Trine 2 and its DLC. No spoilers, but it was a beautiful monster, and a really fun fight.\n\n- Multiplayer is, as promised, very buggy, and chock full of client rep issues. This is pretty normal for a game in this stage of development, so do not let it get you down, players! We did a full multiplayer run and both of us had a great time with the mechanics. For games that use the "unlimited" mode, and just in general, a small colored cursor or color pallette shift to differentiate cliens would be great. In close quarters, it was hard to tell whose Pontius was whose.\n\n- There's a free-for-all level and even a few mod levels available in the workshops if you want to enjoy ballsing around as Pointus for an extra hour or three.\n\nI am going to put this away and await the finished project!","April 26, 2015","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Having grown up in the 80's where platform games were the norm and the birth of the first person shooter was a blocky pipe dream akin to the Windows 95 3D screen saver, anyway I'm still extremely fond of platformers and they hold a somewhat sentimental value to me, now I've been a fan of the previous 2 games in the Trine series and played them to death. I viewed a small youtube clip of Trine 3 a few months ago of a very much work in progress beta showing the opening level and my jaw just dropped, I was excited it was a continuation of the prequels and nothing seemed out of place.. but then something changed! a third dimension seemed to appear and the player was being moved into the distance, my mind then wanders and I start thinking "well that's the end of that then, if it ain't broke, why?? it's a platformer that was what made it so appealing, why change the format", should I have been worried.. Lets see.\n\n\nFirstly it is still Trine the same 3 main characters our heroes, Amadeus the Wizard, Pontius the Knight and Zoya the Thief, each character possesses their own special skills which you will need to make your way through each level.\n\nAmadeus: His skills include the ability to summon objects including boxes and platforms he can also manipulate contraptions and certain level objects, but he's pretty much useless in a fight.\n\nPontius: The knight outfitted with sword and shield, probably the main character you will use for hacking and slashing your way through bad guys.\n\nZoya: She has uber dexterity armed with a bow and grapple hook.\n\nThe level design is still that beautiful eye candy we're used to seeing in the previous games, but now with a more immersive and fantastic depth which is made ever more impressive when you start moving around into the now 3D environment.. see for yourself.\n\nSo far so good, I've been hitting this game hard as I learned to with the first 2, collect as many collectables as possible along the way to upgrade the characters abilities reach the end and then start all over again and search each level taking the graphics and atmosphere.\n\nThis game I have no doubt is going to be amazing when it is finally released, as it stands at the moment it is still fantastic I have discovered one or two glitches but nothing major.\n\nThe Trine series really are fantastic chill out titles and should be in every ones Steam library, so should you purchase this game... definitely! Whether you wait for the final release or grab it early access is entirely up to you.\n\nYou can also read my review over at http://forum.overclock3d.net/showthread.php?t=70404","April 27, 2015","true","11.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, upon playing it some more, and upon hearing from the developers why this game was so short (due to budget constraints, mostly), I've decided to give it, overall, a thumbs up. The gameplay is fun (there's just not enough of it), and it really is gorgeous. The mechanics are pretty nice (despite there being no upgrades, which I miss), and, since it exited early access, the bugs are very few and far between.\nThe reason that I decided to change my review from a negative to a positive one is because I would like to see more of this game, which will only happen if the developers get the support they need. It would be stupid if a game which was criticised for being too short had to remain short only because it was criticised for it. They were (and hopefully, still are) planning to make more of this story, but they could only bring out so much to start with (which the marketers did NOT make clear in early access), hence the cliff hanger ending.\nIt really is a nice concept. They've taken a 2D platforming game and turned it into a 3D one, which is still beautiful and still works well, and I, as a long time fan of the whole series, would really like to see some more of the Trine series made. I was a bit annoyed when it first came out about how much money I'd paid for such a short game, but it IS worth it to support the developers, and it IS a very good game.\n\nGameplay: 7/10 (because there are no upgrades, but otherwise it's very nice to play)\nGraphics and look: 9/10 (It IS beautiful. Fleeting, but beautiful.)\nLength: 4/10 (4 hours and I would have liked 10)\nOverall: 6/10 (because it's too short and there are no upgrades to work towards, but if it was made longer this would definitely be an 8 or 9/10)","August 22, 2015","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Trine 2 is amazing in both UX and story, but Trine 3 really has the worst UX. Sometimes the levels difficulty is not so difficult, and the only fact that you keep trying or failing is because of the horrible UX (3d jumps which are not really 3d, combination of keys which sometimes works and sometimes not, and more...).

The gameplay changed a little by adding an actual 3d dimension. Trine is no longer just a beautiful sidescroller but fully allows you to explore every nook and cranny of the locations. Though this is nice and refreshing it does feel like it takes a way a little bit of the gameplay. The gameplay itself seems a little simplefied. The 'puzzles' are much more easy, and there is no levelling or skill system. This is not nessecarilly a bad thing but the previous two games definetly felt like they had more depth to it. Still I enjoyed playing it very much.\nThe game itself is a little short, but I still played it for about 8 hours. Just like the previous installments, if you just want to go from the start to the end it is very easy and you can rush through each level in no-time. However, when you try and find the triangles or flasks or whatever items, you will need to explore a lot more of the locations and are forced to appreciate the beauty of the level design. The duration of the game can theoretically be extended indefinetly by the introduction of a community level design tool. I have yet to try this out, but I'm sure that in time there will be many beauties to be found.\n\nThe story was somewhat thin and the ending was a major let down. I hate it when games don't have a proper ending. By this, I don't mean there is something bad with open endings, but if the ending basically has TO BE CONTINUED on the screen, this always feels like a copout. At least then sell it as an episodic game.\n\nTLDR I enjoyed the game, but the gameplay and story seem a little less well developped than previous installments of Trine. The game, however, is still very beautiful and fun to play.","September 25, 2015","true","9.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

We all agree it has the Trine feel to it but the ability upgrades of Trine 2 that are missing in this game are dissapointing. Also, apparently there is an abrupt ending. Not cool Frozenbyte. I hope they'll change their minds and make free DLC or something to finish the story. As for the new 3D levels, I really enjoyed the freshness of them and that they broke away from the 2.5D method of the previous two games. I just wish they had fine tuned the 3D gameplay more (fixed camera takes some getting used to). I would recommend it due to its beautiful graphics and music like the others had but I recommend getting it during a steam sale or if you haven't already played a Trine game, to start by playing Trine 2 which was my favorite of the series.\n\nTL;DR: Beautiful graphics and music as always, but unfortunate sacrifice of some game mechanics and story.","September 27, 2015","true","20.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have played them many times and still find them enjoyable.\nThe problem with Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power is that it took away almost everything the previous games had, like an experience system, different weapons or Amadeus' stackable conjurations. The new 3D enviroment is great but makes the console clumsy at times. The 'trineangles' that replaced experience points from previous games serve nothing more than a means to unlock pointless challenges, although the small story levels as the individual heroes are quite fun.\nBut those are not the worst thing about this game. The worst is the length. I played it for 4.2 hours (according to Steam) and in that time I managed to complete the story and side levels as well as collect all the trineangles. The story, in spite of being enjoyable, feels incomplete, whereas the previous games were both finite stories of Amadeus, Pontius and Zoya.\nAll in all, this game shouldn't have been released as complete in this state. An episodic format would make much more sense.","September 7, 2015","false","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

THAT, My Friends, is unforgivable.\n\nMaybe if the game was called "Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power, Part 1" ...","September 7, 2015","false","16.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It looks like it didn't go through a beta-testing phase. Bridges getting stuck, boxes or stones disappearing, falling through the floor and dying...\n\nThese bugs don't really ruin the game that badly tho, and sometimes they are even fun, but what really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off was...\n- Length and ending: I won't spoil the ending, also because...IT'S NOT THERE! The game is not finished, it has no ending: what was supposed to be a cliffhanger is not an ending at all, we have no way to see how the main characters will complete their quest, if they even manage to do so that is. We actually beat the game in less than 4 hours, hanging around and wasting a lot of time. I suppose a normal player would be able to finish this easily within 3.5 hrs. I don't mind a game being this short, but I would never ever pay 20+ € for merely 4 hrs of gameplay.\n\nTL:DR The game is fun as long as it lasts, but ends too fast, without a real ending and is so buggy overall that looks like an indie game.","September 6, 2015","false","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I bought the three pack to play co-op with my friends, and we completed the game in about 3 hours of game play. If not less.\n\nAlso most of the puzzles can be solved by just one character, little teamwork is actually needed and we breezed through the game with very little communication, the few 'bosses' are deafeatable by one character really and the final boss leaves the ranger feeling a little left out and the wizard does most of the work.\n\nI thought the game was about half way through when it suddenly ended.\nI assume Trine 4 will continue the story since no dlc is planned, however will half the game be a tutorial for the characters again? Leaving just a few levels of actual interesting puzzles to solve.\n\nConclusion\n-----------\n\nUltimately for the price I expected more especally after the first two great games, this feels like a rushed half finished release which should still be in early access until another 4-6 levels have been added to it to complete the story before it is finally released...

Any ressource invested into that feature was a complete and utter waste of time that did in no way improve the gameplay or the user experience. On the contrary, I feel rather ripped off, because obviously this "new feature" was gained at the expense of half the content that the previous games in the series had to offer. Also the coding for the third dimension is obviously more challening. In fact so challening that with the limited ressources of the project, the latest installment of the Trine series lacks any of the interesting and fun physics of the previous games. The physics in Trine 3 are buggy and glitchy more than anything else.\n\nThe third installment does not have any puzzles worth mentioning, it is way too easy and washed down. The story is extremely short and not very engaging.\n\nI recommend anyone to buy Trine 1 and 2 instead, Trine 3 in the current state is too short, not good value and way too easy. In addition, you soon feel like Trine 3 is designed to be monetized by adding several DLCs in the future.\n\nOn the positive side:\n- Graphics are beautiful\n- Artstyle is nice\n- Soundtrack is good (although Trine 1 and 2 are better)\n\nOn the negative side:\n- the game is very short\n- physics are buggy\n- complete and utter lack of any kind of challenge\n- very limited abilities compared to previous games (Amadeus 1 box, Zoya 1 arrow, Pontius only 1 weapon)\n- controls are weird, probably because of the many glitches (jumping in mid air or on walls and ledges in an uncontrollable fashion)","January 12","false","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With its interactive game-play, colorful graphics and pretty much unlimited range possibilities in roaming and explring the maps, Trine 3 outmatches far & beyond its previous two parts, making it probably the funnest game there is for playing, multiplayer with your friends and have some lol-time together! Enjoy! :)","January 13","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was quite excited to play the 3rd one when I saw it  here on Steam. Unfortunately, the game was released unfinished. It cuts off in the middle of the story with no warning and a message that you have finished Trine 3, but are welcome to explore the map. I really hope the developer reconsiders DLC and finishes the story, but it doesn't sound like they have that planned right now. Below is a portion of the developer response to everyone's complaints from the Steam discussion page on Trine 3:\n\n"So we did not intentionally make the game “short” as many have said in order to make money off of future DLC or whatever. We tried to make something too ambitious, and it ended up financially impossible. What we sold on Early Access was the “realistic” vision and what we promised is what we have delivered, in our opinion. The finished Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power game might not be as long as we hoped initially, but something we are very proud of nonetheless, and generally around 6-7 hours is what we think new players will spend with the game on average. We're aware that some players have completed the game in less than that, 4-5 hours for example, and we accept that. I'm sure you can speedrun it much faster too, but so you could in previous Trine games and in most other games too.\n\nAs for the cliffhanger ending and DLC – there are no plans for a DLC. Continuation of the story is a different matter however, but we have released everything we had and everything we aimed to release since the beginning of the Early Access. The future of the series is now in question, as the feedback, user reviews and poor media attention has caught us by surprise..."","March 28","false","12.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

All the FREEDOM & FUN you have experienced from Trine 1 & 2 are gone. You cannot create your own objects anymore as a magician; you cannot throw ropes around everywhere as a theif/archer. Instead, it is now a simple "gameplay" of click, click, click for 5 year olds.\n\n2. They tried to make more movement choices than left and right AND THEY FAILED. They had the right idea but the execution was ghastly. The movement is wonky and awkward. It feels laggy. I wish they didn't try to make a change instead and it would've been far much better.\n\n3. It is impossible to play the game as everything is glitching with everything else. BEWARE OF GLITCHING YOURSELF TO EVERYTHING AND NOTHING.\n\nConclusion: This game is a complete joke and a mockery to Trine 1 & 2 fans. It is worse than alpha test games and is not worth a dollar.

That's how I felt when I beat the last level here.

In my opinion Trine and Trine 2 represent the absolute pinnacle of game design, gameplay and art style.\n\nI thought that logically, if you cannot improve on perfection, then any changes that you make can only detract from the quality of the game, particularly a change as drastic as adding an extra dimension.\n\nBut I was utterly wrong. Frozenbyte have mastered the transition to 3D. Trine 3 is every bit as good, and pretty, and fun to play, as its predecessors.\n\nSome people have criticised Trine 3 for being too short. But I felt that it was a perfect length. It took me just over seven hours to complete the game and earn every achievement. I don’t think that’s bad value for money at the asking price, and I’d always rather a game was too short than too long.\n\nI would recommend Trine 3 as wholeheartedly as I recommend Trine and Trine 2. I hope that Trine 3 performs well for Frozenbyte and that we see more great Trine games in future.\n\nIf you liked Trine and Trine 2, then you won’t regret this purchase.","August 26, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game seems nice but unfortunately they traded fun gameplay, great controlls, graphics and character abilities for the 3D gimmick - and I just can't accept that. The mage, who used to be my favourite character, has been nerfed beyond belief. I'm spending most of the time fighting the terrible controlls rather than playing the game. The camera also, which was great in previous games, has remained unchanged which means that in 3D enviroment you're constantly dying by falling into a pit you didn't see or trying to get out of some cavern you fell into but can't get out of because your character is obstructed by a wall or something!!! That is unacceptable.\n\nThis... this is bad enough, and the biggest flaw of the game by far, but unfortunately not the only one! The graphics are worse. The character redesign is terrible. The story is rather lame and feels rushed and frankensteined from other games. Not to mention the game is like 5 hours long! The stage select screen is pointless and just takes you out of the story everytime you have to choose another level.\n\nSuffice to say I'm really dissapointed by that game :/ I really wanted to love it and I'm probably going to finish the game but If you think it's as good as previous two - it's not!

It's really great work and huge changes comparing to first two versions. I like all the games very much, played many times, complete freedom and many ways to find a solution. But now it's in 3D! It's really different sense to be in 3D with your favorite heroes. Yes, of course it's quite buggy but I understand everything cause I'm developer. So DEVs will fix all these things of course and thank you this games. Once I stuck in textures while playing for knight. What you do with Zoya - is super cool! Zoya now is like Prince of Persia - she climbs and run on walls, also can jump from walls - this facinating! I didn't understand how to move objects with Amadeus in Z axis - when I move mouse up - it goes up, when I move down - it goes down. But how to move in Z-axis?\n\nSummary: I recommend everyone to download Trine 1 then 2 and then 3 - so while your'e playing 1 and 2, the third will be fixed and ready do play, now it's little buggy but you can try!

I must admit though, the jump to 3D was a minor cause for concern. On the one hand it is the perfect direction to go for the series to prevent getting stale, and it offers many new possibilities for puzzles and level-design. On the other hand, the Trine games always were 2D puzzle-platformers at heart, and I wondered how some of the three heroes' abilities would translate to a 3D world.\n\nSo, was the wait for Trine 3 worth it? In short: yes, very much so - with the little caveat that only 2 story levels and 1 challenge level have been released so far and the game is still a bit buggy due to Early Access. The developers have promised to add updates and new levels regularly, with the full release coming later this year. Given Frozenbyte's track record I have no reason to doubt them, and judging by the quality of the currently released levels we are certainly in for a treat with the full Trine 3.\n\nThe levels are rather long, intricate and inventive, the music is awesome and the graphics are as spectacular as ever - with the added bonus that you can explore the levels a lot more thoroughly because they are fully 3D now. If you ever played the previous games in the series, especially the Goblin Menace levels, you know that the various scenes practically invited you to step into the background, and now finally you have the possibility to do just so. Still, I have to admit actually playing the game in 3D was quite a shock at first, as it means that even veterans from the first two games must relearn some of the character's moves. Especially Amadeus' and Zoya's abilities were distinctly changed and tuned to better fit the 3D world. So I would suggest you take your time in the tutorial level to fully train the new controls, otherwise even level 2 could proof somewhat frustrating. But give it a chance and you'll soon see that the new controls work perfectly well and offer a whole new world of opportunities.\n\nHowever, not everthing is perfect. I should note that the combination of 3D levels and forced camera positions can make judging some jumps and distances rather difficult. I mostly noticed that when going out of the way to reach some hard to obtain experience shards. For me that is not such a big deal and is easily outweighed by the beauty and enhanced freedom of the game. But others might dislike that kind of trial and error. Still, seeing as death has not much of a penalty and checkpoints are abundant, most people should be able to live with it.\n\nAs for the other negative point, the game is currently in Early Access, and it shows. Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly playable, and a lot of fun too once you get used to the new controls. But at the current time a number of more or less annoying bugs still exist, from crashes when resuming a saved game to the music suddenly stopping on random during the gameplay. Also a lot of polish is still missing, so you might notice some missing dialog lines or performance issues due to bad optimization. All of these problems will surely be addressed by the developers until the release of the full game, but people considering to buy the Early Access version shoud adjust their expectations accordingly or else wait a little longer.\n\nI will update this review as the game develops in the following weeks and months.","April 22, 2015","true","19.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The series makes the transition to 3D in fine form and it feels like the mechanics have been cleaned up on Zoya the Thief and Amadeus the Wizard. Some will lament the fact that you can't draw custom sized boxes anymore (they're a set size instead) or that Zoya can only grapple limited spots (metal rings it appears rather than practically all wooden surfaces), but I dig these changes.\n\nThe 3D aspect has introduced a minor new problem; it's not always clear where the edge is (at the front or back of screen)! I say minor because deaths are more forgiving than ever. You now respawn within feet of where you died instead of at the previous checkpoint (health ball things from earlier games). EDIT: Health Balls are still there after level 1!\n\nThe first level of this game hits the ground running by introducing the three unique heroes in three unique locations (the third being especially nice)! The game is BEAUTIFUL as were the previous two entries.

It's really great work and huge changes comparing to first two versions. I like all the games very much, played many times, complete freedom and many ways to find a solution. But now it's in 3D! It's really different sense to be in 3D with your favorite heroes. Yes, of course it's quite buggy but I understand everything cause I'm developer. So DEVs will fix all these things of course and thank you this games. Once I stuck in textures while playing for knight. What you do with Zoya - is super cool! Zoya now is like Prince of Persia - she climbs and run on walls, also can jump from walls - this facinating! I didn't understand how to move objects with Amadeus in Z axis - when I move mouse up - it goes up, when I move down - it goes down. But how to move in Z-axis?\n\nSummary: I recommend everyone to download Trine 1 then 2 and then 3 - so while your'e playing 1 and 2, the third will be fixed and ready do play, now it's little buggy but you can try!

Beautifully done, adults and children alike will be able to enjoy it\n\nThree Dimensional levels. They have changed the mechanics of how the game works slightly. I won't go into detail, but I think they are positive changes, adds a lot more possibilities that can be done with puzzles. Slightly buggy in places, but it is a 3D physics puzzlers. Can you name me one without slight physics bugs?\n\nNegative:\n\nIt is slightly short. It is only a $20 title. A lot of people have been bashing this game for it length, but I think they are just comparing it the prequels in length. Yeah, more is better, but it's not a massive negative.\n\nDifficulty. I am a bit of a trine veteran, so maybe take this with a pinch of salt. But I found the puzzles far too easy. I can think of three times where I had to actually think for a few minutes.

This time they implemented 3d! Being use to using the WSAD keys in most of my games, this was easy for me to get use to, unlike some of my friends. Now there is a level choosing system in a game board-esque styled start point. Here you can choose what levels you want to play, as long as you have enough Trineangles to unlock it. You can also play through certain parts of that level if you haven't collected all of the Trineangles first time (it will show you what part of the map you missed them and how many you missed).\n\nWith a new 3D Trine comes new controls. You can no longer draw with the mouse to conjure boxes from Amadeus (F is an instant box while Q and E moves the box further/closer from you). Levitating a fellow player on a conjured box in co-op is not possible any more(and if you can I can't seem to find the option). Using the W and S key for Zoyas rope to go up and down won't let her swing in certain directions (it is now the middle scroll wheel). Pontius can scale walls like a professional rock climber so you barely need to play any other character (is this a glitch?). Respawning a friend is really slow.\n\nOverall it is still a great game to play with friends. There are some bugs including the Zoya co-op floating stasis in her intro, boxes spazzing out, characters becoming stuck in weird places, characters falling through objects, respawns being placed under objects in dangerous water, and Trineangles appearing orange even though you've collected them. There are probably more, but these are what I have personally witnessed. I will always be a Trine fan and will continue to be one, but I have to admit I think Trine 2 is the best so far.","August 22, 2015","true","8.2"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","15","33","0","0"

I have to admit I was expecting something more along the lines of Viewtiful Joe, where the 3d aspect of the game was more of a stylistic thing than actually being a 3d game.  Needless to say, I feel the third dimension has made this game less fun to play.\n\nFighting with Pontius has become frustrating as hell. Blocking seems to be basically useless now. I can't tell where I would be blocking so it seems like the best practice is just to mash the left mouse button until the enemies are dead. Trying to use any sort of strategies like blocking attacks just seems to get me killed at this point. I liked playing Zoya because she felt nimble and quick, but she feels clumsy now. Still, I feel fighting is easier with her since at least you can keep your distance from enemies while using the arrows which auto-aim.\n\nI also lost count how many times I've died in the short time I've played simply because the camera angles are set in such a way that it's nearly impossible for me to tell whether or not it's a jump I should actually be able to make. Probably more often is when I hit space for jump and up the same time (since it still feels more like a 2d platformer than a 3d platformer) and end up jumping behind the platform I'm attempting to get onto.\n\nI suppose in the end it's the controls that are really hurting this game for me right now. The way the chracters feel very imprecise and sloppy, and the lack of camera control in a 3d game only exacerbate these control issues. There's also a feeling of vagueness while actually in the game that's offputting. I'm (obviously) not the best at puzzle action games, but games like Ori and the Blind Forest is an example of a puzzleish game done well. I feel like most of the challenge in Trine  3 has more to do with my confusion about the presentation of the game moreso than the actual challenge of the game's puzzles.\n\nI realize this game is still in development, but I feel like it's the design I'm fighting with at this point rather than bugs.\nThis game will no doubt improve as time goes on, but my issues with the game are so foundational I don't see how incremental improvements will address them.","April 26, 2015","false","0.8"," 19 of 42 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","19","42","0","0"

The music fits all the beautiful scenery and the atmosphere of the game. The silly humor of the characters is also part of the story just as before. All in all as a game it is chilling, gorgeous looking and runs smooth most of the time. The are some glitch like problems but that's probably because of the early access, since the previous games had no such issues when they were fully complete. The only thing i find kind of frustrating is that i can't seem to get use to the 3D style. It just feels weird after Trine 1 and 2. And sometimes it is hard to determine for example the distances when you jump... which in a platformer can lead to numerous annoying deaths. But there is of course a new potential in 3D and the developers really try to live up to this potential. So I'm optimistic about the whole outcome. The one thing I recommend though is that Trine 3 should not be the Trine game you start with :D I mean not because of the story but because it feels so much better after the first two games, and with this whole 3D thing it seems a bit more complex then those. So try out Trine 1 and/or 2 and then consider buying this. It's possibly the best way to enjoy the series or to determine if you like this kind of game at all.","May 29, 2015","true","17.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I can't even complain about so called "bugs" all games have them, and at least we can all start this game up and play it, I've played tons of games that were supposedly AAA and they wouldn't even startup on release for crying out loud lol. Also I love the Trine series, even this one. It's even more beautiful visually and the gameplay is still fun, and the new 3D element is actually kinda cool and I don't have any issues really with it.  You still play on a 2D plane pretty much just with a little bit more depth now, and I guess that bothers some people but not me, I thought it envolopes me into the environment even further, I've always wanted to ineract with the amazing backgrounds in the original Trine 1 & 2 just because there is so much detail and now I can :)\n\nNow yes, I do have agree that this game should be LONGER just because I love the series so much I simply want more lol. I also did want that ability to upgrade my character put back in the game as well, that is really how it made gamers stick to playing the previous games more than just puzzle solving. I am so let down that the studio actually ran out of money making the game when I would have thought that all the money from the previous games made them enough to really push for this title to be a real AAA. I was prepared to pay a full $60 or more for a longer game. It wouldn't even bother me if they tried to add more later and change the story if needed and charge another $20 or what ever, I just want more.\n\nI still recommend this game and it's not as bad as every one says, I'm sure they are just dissapointed that the game is a little short when they expected it to be so long. Plus really, someone show me a game that looks this beautiful and is a COOP puzzle solving side scroller with a 3D environment that is truly fantasy based and this fun to play? Oh and the sound/music is pretty great too lol. I can't think of many other titles that go this far and this well into this category while still putting a smile on to my face and I love playing it with my friends. I hope Frostbyte can figure out some way to pull off what they did with Trine 2. It would make my day, esp since most games nowadays are really biting at the bit to be different and fun and creative, like this one game does effortlessly :)\n\nDon't be too afraid of what other people are saying, if you like Trine you will still like this game too, and it does have it's short comings but all games do. Frostbyte knows they messed up and they also charge accordingly for the game. Don't complain when it's around $20 and you get this kind of visual quality and fun out of it, and who knows maybe Frostbyte will find a way to make this better. Download this and enjoy, I did and I don't regret it, you won't either if your a true Trine fan ;)","August 23, 2015","true","17.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I estimate this game will give us one hour per level playing cooperatively on the same screen.\n\nThe 3D addition is well done, and puzzles are challenging but a little on the easy side which honestly is good when you want to expend a nice time with your family and friends.\n\nThe game includes and Editor so you can create your own levels and mods, and share them on Steam. I think this is a great addition and will provide many hours of learning and allow us to be creative which is very valuable.\n\nThe storyline is designed so you can easily go back a replay some levels, to collect more triangles in case you need them or just for fun.\n\nI think you will love this game, specially if you enjoy games like: Trine 2, Gauntlet, Magicka, Lara Croft and The Temple of Osiris, Lego games and any fantasy themed cooperative games.","August 29, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Trine 3 is a huge step in terms of gameplay from the first trine games, it uses the 3D environment to full extent, sometimes the camera is a bit weird, but for most of the time it works as it should be, the combat is easier this time around, there are not as many enemies as in previous trine games and for a experienced gamer it was a walk in the park, apart from some of those short challenge mission, where it was sometimes very frustrating to die right near the end of the challenge and I had to respawn at the start of the whole challenge, but some of these were quite enjoyable.\nThe story itself is very good, just like the other trine games, it's a bit disappointing that it ends at a cliffhanger, but at least we can expect some future expansions, which excites me.\n\nWhere the game excells is the overall art style, the graphics are just incredible, the music is wonderful and the narration is top notch. The game is just astounding, some of the environments and vistas are simply breathtaking. I played through the whole game, which took me over 6 hours, with my 3D glasses on using the nvidia 3D vision and I have to say I have never played such a wonderful 3D game apart from the first two trine games and recently the tomb raider from 2013.\n\nTrine 3 is a must have for every Trine fan. It's easier than the first two games, but more enjoyable, the game flows and goes by pretty quickly, so be sure to stop for a moment and enjoy the wonderfully crafted areas and pretty music. I would reccomend this game to any fan of puzzle platforming too. I played it with a mouse and keyboard combo and it played like a charm, it took more than I thought getting used to the 3D enviromental gameplay, but after 10 or so minutes I got the hang of things.\n\nIam looking forward to any future expansions that will conclude the storyline :)\n\n9.5/10","August 23, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Selecting 32-bit sorted my problems and the game now runs smoothly in native 1920x1200 resolution, the caveat being I can only select medium texture quality. Even so, the game still looks gorgeous.\n\n\nWhat I can say is Trine's transition from a 2D scroller to a fully-fledged, more or less, 3D world is not as successful as one would have hoped. In fact, it brings to mind Oddworld Inhabitant's decision to take Abe from 2D to 3D with patchy results.\n\nThat's because in Trine 3, much like Munch's Oddysee, the puzzles which were so intrinsic to the success and charm of the previous games, are sadly lacking in this latest outing. Gone are the carefully upgradable skill trees so beautifully crafted onto each character creating sublime puzzles and a genuine sense of progression, in favour of what is essentially an overly physics-based assault course - with more emphasis on grinding than puzzle solving. The transition to 3D adding very little to the player experience.\n\nWhilst I could recommend Trine 3 to gamers who've played and enjoyed similar games, I find it quite difficult to recommend to those, like me, who've grown to love Trine 1 & 2.\n\nDisappointing. 5/10","August 21, 2015","false","18.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Can't wait to try out the stereoscopic 3d when the game hopefully launches on PS4 aswell.\n\nGAMEPLAY: EASIER than TRINE 1 and 2. Puzzles are easier to master. The new 3d aspects need a little bit of time to get used to but once used to it the platforming is fun as ever!  Also the boss encounters are really cool!

I and my girlfriend were big fans of Trine 1 and 2 and I just can't understand why they have brought out something that's a strange mash of a 3D platformer and 2D side scroller. The game now has a strange feel to it like it just doesn't know what it wants to be and as a result just doesn't have the magic of the older titles.\n\nIf I had never played the first games I might have even enjoyed this but all I have now is the knowledge that this will be the end of the Trine games. Either the franchise will die off as a result of people not liking the "new" style or the franchise will take off even more and the strange half breed Trines will be the way things will continue. Either way it's unlikely there will ever be a true Trine.\n\nI wish I'd never played this game as now the all the fond memories I have of playing the previous ones will always be tainted with the disappointment of the third incarnation.","June 11, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","1"

As a Trine fan I can say that the game is claery not ready.\nThe gameplay is fluid with Pontius, now he can plane and make jumps with impact as standard skills. Amadeus is lost, the old that I loved was replaced by one that summons boxes automatically and became incredibly annoying to control them. You need to have patience with Zoya, she does exactly what you do not want her to do, but I liked the innovations that came with her, like pulling boxes and doors with the rope, the automatic sighting is another thing that makes me sad. In 3D you get freedom of movement but loses the fluidity of Zoya and Amadeus! When players defeat the big monster (which was an easy battle, actually Trine 3 is extremely easy, I felt like a child playing, Trine 1 was quite hard) Zoya says she wants to return to his normal life, but her normal life is full of adventures, like Pontius! I mean, their personalities are a little lost, Amadeus should be the one with the desire to immediately return to his family, but okay, let's continue. The sountrack is just amazing (as always) as well as the innovations of art direction, expect to see deep woods and forests.\nThe story don't need to be deep, it's so good to feel that you are inside a cliche fable for children but at the same time realize that the environment is hostile and dangerous. I would love to see old European tales adapted in the game.\n>>>Once again, I repeat, I love the franchise and I hope they do incredible innovations and fix my friend Amadeus. I thought the franchise was dead, but when I saw Trine 3 on Steam, I went crazy!

(i assume that there is at least one person name Johan there, since the developers are from Finland) We've made two amazing and beautiful platformers with puzzles that everyone loved but i still feel that there is something missing from my life. I feel like we can do more! I feel like we should have at least one game in our series that is going to ruin everything we done previously and provoke rage and hatred, so then we could compete with EA and Ubisoft and consider ourselves real gaming studio! What do you think?\n\n- I agree completely Olaf (its probably not a Finnish name but i am not that familiar with their naming practices unfortunately). What did you have in mind?\n\n- Well i thought that we could make it 3d this time, so it would completely ruin perspective so people wouldn't understand where the game world ends and background scenery begins and constantly fall to their death's or get stuck! We would also have to make our backgrounds less beautiful and static than they were previously, because our engine and players systems won't be able to handle it in 3d!\n\n- I like the way you think Johan! Might i also suggest removing all wooden surfaces and replace them with strategically placed hoops, so the thief would play more like Lara Croft in those weird platformer spin-offs that barely anyone likes? Also lets screw with camera angles so it wouldn't follow player everywhere and make it even more frustrating to play?\n\n- Yes! Yes! Lets also remove wizard mechanics, so he wouldn't have to draw stuff and just cast it with one button! It will ruin the immersion and yet another neat feature that people loved! Also it will be much harder to place items in 3d since you would have to move them in one more axis!\n\n- And we will do everything in early access, so there would be a lot of bugs, like disappearing sounds, music and cursor, broken ragdoll animations and graphical glitches!\n\n- Huzzah!\n\nThen they hugged and celebrated, and a lot of pickled herring was consumed that day.\n\nThus the Trine 3 was born.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIts all true though and i did like previous games. It just shows what can ****king with a good concept lead to. Because of 2d they could've used amazing, animated and almost alive backgrounds, which made it look like you were playing an interactive book or something. Now its just another 3d platformer.\n\nI've got both of those arcade Lara Croft games and i've played them a lot - its exactly like that now. In fact thief now uses her whip the same way Lara uses her zip line.\n\nIt doesn't mean that the game is bad now but i am not a huge fan of changing something for the sake of change. The game did not improve and instead just lost something special in the transition. At the very least i can honestly say that backgrounds now look worse, i assume because they couldn't make them as bright, as polished and animated, since they had to make a lot more of them.\n\nNot everything is better in 3d, except:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXStLCZrPM\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso - i'd like to thank the developers for having a sense of humor and answering to this review and my concerns politely :)\n\nI might have been wrong about Finnish names but at least we all can agree that pickled herring in red wine sauce is amazing!","April 21, 2015","false","1.7"," 80 of 421 people (19%) found this review helpful 117 people found this review funny","19","80","421","117","29"

Even though the difficulty of the game is anything but hardcore, it gets so frustrating to repeatedly miss jump after jump, just because there is no indicator, where you might be landing. And while jumping is the most basic action you will perform every few seconds during the game, it is even more anoying to try and place boxes, swing on ropes, shoot arrows oder pull objects to a specific location because it's just hit and miss all the time.\n\nAnd what's even more frustrating are those damned pyramids, which you have to collect, since you need a certain amount of them to unlock levels in the game. But since those things are sometimes hidden in places like boxes without any indication of them beeing in there, it results in you flailing wildly while jumping through the stages in basicaly uncontrolable patterns just so you don't have to play a level again because you missed one of them.\n\n\nSeriously though: Even with all the mixed and bad reviews I still wanted Trine 3 to be good, just because I adored the first two installments. Those were genuinely great platformers. Do yourself a favor and just buy and play those two, instead of wasting your money on this one.","March 21","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still has same enchanting visuals and narrative as before.  It does feel a bit less polished in 3D movement, but it is still very delightful. In my opinion it has all the charm of previous installations and I'm glad developers tried something new - so few do experiment with their franchises. The main "board" screen with level selection felt appropriate, and the book flipping mechanic in some of the later levels was pretty and cool. Side missions felt like a little delicious extra on top of main campaign. All in all I enjoyed trine 3 a bunch, and can easily recommend it to other people, just be aware that due to budget constraints main story wasn't finish so don't expect nice wrap up there.\n\nI also feel that other reviewers are being unjust, declaring that game is:\n* buggy - obviously this may vary, but it hasn't been true in my case, I haven't encountered any issues. Game runs smoothly from techincal side. It seems to require kb+m to setup controls, but after that is completely playeable with the controller.\n* short - yes the story was cut short, which I think devs were upfront about. But it is still full 6+ hours of single player campaign and missions, that's longer than some AAA titles these days.\n* need to collect trineangles to unlock levels - uh, I'm not really sure what the idea is, but you have to really mess up to be forced to redo any levels. If you don't try to rush them down like a speed run - collecting enough trineangles is easy even on the first go.","March 12","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stages also wouldn't unlock properly either.\n\n-All the skills you had before in the other games seem to have disappeared. You only get the basics, no planks, no elemental arrows, no hammer...it's disappointing.\n\n-The story just dies when it clearly should not. Otherwise, you had a sense of working towards completing a quest. There are some side chapters that seem like they're just there for the fun and are very superfluous. Wish they had added more to the main story than those flimsy side chapters.\n\nOn the plus side, it had good looking graphics. Otherwise, this game is a work in progress and rather unfulfilling.\n","January 3","false","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Trine 3 has fewer levels available and fewer abilities compared to Trine 2. It has a significantly higher amount of bugs that need to be worked out. Additionally, the story is not fully resolved at the end of the game. Either DLC is planned or Trine 4 will conclude it. For a fully released game, it sure played like an Early Access title.\n\nThe game is good overall, but the other ones are likely better. Extremely buggy, high amounts of physics issues and net code synching issues when it comes to the achievments. If I was a fan of the series I would be highly disappointed.\n\nPros: Fun puzzle game, ability to switch between characters in a new game mode\nCons: Bugs in synching collectibles in multiplayer vs singleplayer, physics engine is buggy, incomplete story to sell DLC or a sequel.

The story is half a story, I was amazed when it finished how it did, as early as it did.\n\nI sincerely struggle to believe that the team which developed this would place it alongside Trine or Trine 2 in terms of quality, in terms of strength of puzzles, charm, the flexibility which you have in tackling puzzles, level design, length of game and general overall completeness of the product. It isn't there.\n\nTrine 1 & 2 are classics, on any system. Two of the best games ever made. Trine 3 takes what made the previous games and strips the game back to almost barebones. Amongst the changes are that Amadeus can't cast planks at all or multiple crates or cage enemies, Pontius' hammer / magnetic shield is gone, Zoya's grav / fire / freeze arrows and multiple arrows are gone, the rope swing also seems to have been nerfed meaning less scope for acrobatics - its changes like that in my opinion which limit the puzzles and overall fun of the game. The puzzles are weak and the new 3D engine is more psuedo 3D in my eyes. The new ability which Zoya has to attach rope to rope points works well, the boss fights are a marked improvement but it isn't enough.\n\nIts the weakest game in the series by far from a developer which should know better.

Savadgely attacking devs who misjudged the cost/time involved in making large changes to their game wasn't deserved. I for one liked most of the changes, the new levels were nice if different than what I was expecting. I think the biggest problem here was unmanaged expectations and early access.\n\nGamers loved Trine and Trine 2 and I'm positive 90+% of them just wanted what was essentially Trine 2: More Levels. I don't think it was made clear early enough the departures being attempted and how much it was likely to be difficult.  Trine devs should have been a bit more upfront about their difficulties, people understand if told in advance.\n\nI think the other problem was early access and taking people's money before the game was ready. I almost never buy early access because I don't like unfinished products. I think people need to realize that just like Kickstarter, if you pay for something unfinished you are gambling a bit on how it will end up.\n\nAll that said, I do hope Frozenbyte continue making cool platformers like Trine. It would be a shame to lose one of the last devs making such games. It is clear to me there was a brilliant game being made here, it just needed more time and money to be made.

On one hand, I appreciate when a game developer tries something new and ultra-ambitious. On the other hand, I loved the aesthetic and gameplay of Trine 1 and 2, so I sort of feel like why fix what wasn't broken.\nThis game is beautiful, absolutely beautiful. There were more than a few moments where I paused and appreciated the artwork. But there were even more occasions where the 3D movement made puzzles confusing or frustrating, and that's not to mention the occasional clunky/glitchy 3D behavior (Zoya's swinging in particular). None of these things made the game unplayable, they just took me out of the moment.\nThe most startling aspect of the game is the 'cliffhanger,' where you are made to think they are just about to continue their quest, but then the credits start rolling. Actually, I wouldn't even mind the cliffhanger, if I knew they were continuing the story. But I've read, because of overly negative feedback, they are questioning whether or not they should. I really don't think that's fair, though, and I strongly feel that they (or anyone in their position) should finish what you've started.\nIt was, in the end, a fun game. Not the best in the series, but still fun. I would recommend it, especially if doing so meant they would finish the darn story.","December 4, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very disappointing sequel to an otherwise excellent franchise. Trine 3 attempts to a third dimension to a 2D platformer, which is so poorly implemented as to make the game frustratingly unplayable. The difficulty of the game is not in the intricacy of the puzzles, or clever level layout, but rather through gimicky, flimsy controls which leads to monotonous repitition.\n\n- Previously it was possibly to aim the assassin's arrow because the environment only had two dimensions, now the game will automatically select a target based roughly on the character's heading.\n\n- The same problem happens with the wizard, where you cannot tell which object is going to be affected by the levitation power until you press the button. You can no longer select objects with a cursor, instead game selects whatever arbitrary object is nearby to manipulate, or require you to toggle between multiple selectable objects if more than one exists on screen at a time. Once selected, manipulating objects in 3D space is ludicrously difficult, especially with a gamepad.\n\n- Many obstacles need to be solved by placing objects ot jumping "into" the screen (along the Z axis), but without depth cues this is mostly just random guesswork.\n\n- When characters die a blue ghost avatar floats to a random location in the world. The character is resurrected by standing in or near the blue avatar for some time. Sometimes this is in an impossible to reach location (eg. a location requiring the assassin, who is dead), or in the middle of an infinitely spawning battle (eg. requiring the knight, who is dead). Invariably this means forcibly killing the remaining characters and rewinding the game to a previous checkpoint, which are far and few between. In the earlier versions of the game, characters would be resurrected immediately when passing a checkpoint.","November 28, 2015","false","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am a fan of the series, I played the first and the second trine, and i bought immediately the game in april when it was still in early access, with no doubts, but I was wrong.\nBut let's understand why.\nIn the first trine I loved the story, the graphics, the locations, the characters and their weapons, and the chests where you could find collectible items that improved your mana/health for example, the levelling, because the game became harder and you became stronger and I reached to build up to 6 boxes, to cut it short, it was perfect.\nThe second trine had too a great story, great graphics and locations, the characters that i loved to play again, I appreciated the levelling, the weapons, but the items disappeared, and the floating boxes for the wizard disappeared too, and the chests where I hoped to find the items contained just poems and that really disappointed me, but at least the poems told you about the story, so still, it was a good game.\nBut trine 3... during the early access I played the tutorials, the challenges and the first chapters wondering why I wasn't leveling up, why there weren't weapons, but I told myself the game was incomplete, and waited.\nNow that the game has been released, i'm really angry that all my progress disappeared, and at first when I saw the map I was ok with it, I said "cool, a map", but when I had to restart and saw that to play the main story I was forced to play the secondary challenges to obtain the cristals, I became angrier, then I realized there is no leveling up, no weapons, no chests, no items, what game is it then?

When I heard the announcement of the game developers to shift from a 2D to a 3D style sidescrolling puzzle-platformer, I was very eager for the inital reviews, and, to put it mildly, was shocked. The gameplay was said to render the game barely playable, and bugs would appear at any corner. So I waited for some time, and after only half a year the game was featured in a pretty cheap bundle, so this was the opportunity to pick it up and get my personal opinion. And boy, do I regret not having bought the game sooner (even though I probably woudn't have had the time to play it, just to make sales look nicer for what is in my opinion a very talented game development studio).\n\nYes, the new 3D style has a couple of downfalls, as you will misjudge some jumps or opponent locations. But seriously, I couldn't care less, because the art design and the music make more than up for it and are essentially the reason why you sit in awe in front of the game, finding it hard to believe this isn't in a gallery.  In comparison to the previous two games, the story ends on a cliffhanger, probably due to budget shortages. There are some nice and small bonus levels.  The characters have lost a couple of abilities, and there is no skill tree anymore (as rudimentary as that used to be). Honestly, Trine never felt like an RPG to begin with, so the loss of a couple of features isn't that hard on me. Still, I can see why fans might have felt a little let-down and disappointed at the initial release.\n\nOverall, this is what you can expect from Trine 3: Beautiful graphics and art design, a good tune whenever you need one, and admittedly not that hard puzzles. However, if you're one quick to be frustrated by missing a jump or can't stand navigating levitating boxes around, better keep your distance: You can have a look at Trine 2 if you want to admire similar artwork, and if you find yourself wanting more of the same, you can always come back. I sure hope Frozenbyte will not take the harsher criticism towards the game to heart and continue their great work. 2D, 2.5D or 3D? Doesn't really matter to me.","February 26","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is half a story, I was amazed when it finished how it did, as early as it did.\n\nI sincerely struggle to believe that the team which developed this would place it alongside Trine or Trine 2 in terms of quality, in terms of strength of puzzles, charm, the flexibility which you have in tackling puzzles, level design, length of game and general overall completeness of the product. It isn't there.\n\nTrine 1 & 2 are classics, on any system. Two of the best games ever made. Trine 3 takes what made the previous games and strips the game back to almost barebones. Amongst the changes are that Amadeus can't cast planks at all or multiple crates or cage enemies, Pontius' hammer / magnetic shield is gone, Zoya's grav / fire / freeze arrows and multiple arrows are gone, the rope swing also seems to have been nerfed meaning less scope for acrobatics - its changes like that in my opinion which limit the puzzles and overall fun of the game. The puzzles are weak and the new 3D engine is more psuedo 3D in my eyes. The new ability which Zoya has to attach rope to rope points works well, the boss fights are a marked improvement but it isn't enough.\n\nIts the weakest game in the series by far from a developer which should know better.

Zoya's rope is easy to manipulate, Pontius is easy as always to control. The only awkard part is controlling boxes with amadeus (two sticks are used), but any awkwardness included is the kind that's fun to play with. I personally had no trouble jumping on platforms.\n\nPOWERS\nWhile the characters have no unlockable powers, they have been given other abilities. All characters can wall jump and grab ledges now. Pontius can still charge and use his sheild as a glider. He can also do a ground pound, which is pretty entertaining. Zoya has no special arrows, but her rope is AMAZING in this game. It can be used to tie stuff together and has actual rope physics now (ie can be wrapped around pillars, etc.). Amadeus got shorted by being given only one box to summon. He can pound it into the ground, however, making him able to fight enemies off.\nI'm actually a fan of less powers, the 3D controls already complicate the controls , so I think it was a good move simplify things.\n\nSTORY\nI was bummed about how the story gets cut off in the middle, but the game does leave you with a cliffhanger to wrap things up.\n\nSHORT GAME\nit's short, but it was the best 3-some hours of Trine I've played. It's pretty clear Frozenbyte went for quality rather than quantity. Every screen I saw there were new 3D models being used. There are some side challenges included with the main game.\n\nDLC\nI seriously doubt Frozenbyte is plotting some DLC scheme given the nature of the company. If they really wanted to rip people off, they would release DLC a few months after the first half. I would not mind buying the sequal if they decide to make it.\n\nMAGICAL\nyes, this game will make you feel like you are in a storybook, hands down. Every level is different from the last unlike the previous Trine games. There is even a level where the rendering changes to make you feel like you are in another world.\n\nFINAL OPINION: Get this game! Its worth at least $10 despite the shortness.","December 27, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The transition from 2D to 3D is actually handled reasonably well, and I had a good time playing through with different mechanics from the Trine 1+2 platforming.  Fortunately, the game retains Trine's lush visuals, so it's still a treat to look at, and the newer mechanics made possible by the move to 3D are fun (though I missed the more fluid rope-swinging that Zoya was capable of in Trine 1+2).\n\nThe transition to 3D is helped out somewhat by the level design, which for the most part allows you to play individual setpieces as if they were still a 2D puzzle.  It's true that sometimes player positioning becomes an issue, and occasionally you'll end up misjudging where you are in relation to where you're jumping, but overall I didn't have any problems with it really.  I did have a few unintentional deaths due to my character not being where I thought she was, but since death is only a minor inconvenience in the game, it never bothered me.\n\nCharacter abilities are restricted compared to previous Trine games, to account for the increased complexity of dealing with them in a 3D environment, but it's nice that the characters start out with all of their abilities intact.  The "trineangles" you collect in Trine 3 no longer count towards character upgrades, but to unlocking levels.  This could've been problematic, but the Trineangles aren't super hidden, and when you select a level section from the menu, it'll tell you from which sections you're missing Trineangles, so it's much easier to hunt down missing ones.  Unlike with previous Trine games, I'd very often finish up a level to discover that I'd gotten all of them first time around, so I did far less replaying than I'd done in previous installments.\n\nThe biggest drawback, of course, is that it's definitely a shame that Frozenbyte wasn't able to create the full-length Trine 3 that they'd set out to create.  The ending is certainly abrupt and leaves the storyline hanging, and anyone not prepared for that is likely to be quite disappointed.  It helps, certainly, to go into the game knowing that it's a truncated storyline.  It's also shorter than the other Trine installments, for the same reason, but I got a good eight hours of gameplay to get through all the content, which I was happy enough with for the price.\n\nSo yeah: certainly not a perfect product, but IMO it's a worthy addition to the series.","November 6, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I heard the announcement of the game developers to shift from a 2D to a 3D style sidescrolling puzzle-platformer, I was very eager for the inital reviews, and, to put it mildly, was shocked. The gameplay was said to render the game barely playable, and bugs would appear at any corner. So I waited for some time, and after only half a year the game was featured in a pretty cheap bundle, so this was the opportunity to pick it up and get my personal opinion. And boy, do I regret not having bought the game sooner (even though I probably woudn't have had the time to play it, just to make sales look nicer for what is in my opinion a very talented game development studio).\n\nYes, the new 3D style has a couple of downfalls, as you will misjudge some jumps or opponent locations. But seriously, I couldn't care less, because the art design and the music make more than up for it and are essentially the reason why you sit in awe in front of the game, finding it hard to believe this isn't in a gallery.  In comparison to the previous two games, the story ends on a cliffhanger, probably due to budget shortages. There are some nice and small bonus levels.  The characters have lost a couple of abilities, and there is no skill tree anymore (as rudimentary as that used to be). Honestly, Trine never felt like an RPG to begin with, so the loss of a couple of features isn't that hard on me. Still, I can see why fans might have felt a little let-down and disappointed at the initial release.\n\nOverall, this is what you can expect from Trine 3: Beautiful graphics and art design, a good tune whenever you need one, and admittedly not that hard puzzles. However, if you're one quick to be frustrated by missing a jump or can't stand navigating levitating boxes around, better keep your distance: You can have a look at Trine 2 if you want to admire similar artwork, and if you find yourself wanting more of the same, you can always come back. I sure hope Frozenbyte will not take the harsher criticism towards the game to heart and continue their great work. 2D, 2.5D or 3D? Doesn't really matter to me.","February 26","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

New to Trine 3 is that you wont be able to advance your character - it has all its skills from the beginning. You start at chapter 1 and depending on how many Pyramids you collect on your way thourgh the chapter the more side chapters you are able to play. That said, its up to you if you go straight for the main chapters or take a detour. Though I cant say, if they are optional or if you have to do them to make it to the final chapter, as I do the optional chapters first. The thing is, every chapter requires a certain amount of collected pyramids and if you dont have them you have to collect them in previous chapters - its a bit of like collecting stars in super mario bros to get the extra level, bit old school, but fine.\n\nA big pro is that it is playable in coop\n\nTrine 3 added the third dimension - most of the time it is not that much of an issue. The real downer is, that you cant adjust the camera, so some things are hard to tell where they are in depth or are hidden from you, because you have not the right angle to spot them.\n\nThe 3D is also the reason, why I play it with a pad - keyboard is very bit painful IMHO for 3D. But my pad is a 8 key, 2-axis pad and it gets real difficult to play the mage with that, as you cant lever stuff as you are supposed to do, so I probably need to upgrade my pad for such kind of games.\n\nThe level design is beatiful, while a tad on the short side - after a half day, I'm almost through with most pyramids collected.\n\nDespite getting used to 3D the game has some quality issue in terms of bugs. Especially when it comes to coop play. Like that the other player cant move or my screen goes black when another player joins. In classic mode, when I die I cant switch character and have to wait until I get revived - my colleque is able to switch to another character and revive the fallen character. Rather seldom some scripted events fail.\n\nConsidering the gameplay I would buy it again, but I wish some patches get out to make it less frustrating from time to time...","January 3","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is why i think the story felt a little short. I kept loosing track of time and continued completing chapters because I wanted to know the next part of the story.\n\nThe characters felt familliar but slightly different, from the new use of Zoya's rope to the charging and slamming of Pontius. The new game features got me wanting more.\n\nFinally the artstyle was breathtaking. Like the 2D games Trine 3 has delivered a colourful environment that felt alive. From start to finish it felt polished and complete, even with some different artstyles throughout the game.\n\nShort Summary;\nIf you like big games with a lot of replayability i would not reccomend this game but rather a bigger multiplayer game. But if you want to get pulled into a story with an amazing artstyle, and enjoy some casual game time with some friends through an enjoyable co-op game.

The negative reviews seem more based on it being different to Trine1&2. This is really not a bad game at all. Hear me through...\n\nFirstly, play it with an Xbox controller if you have one. Game plays really well with it. The 3D concept is not too hard at all, is a nice twist on the previous incarnations (you can see they worked really hard to take the game to new heights, even if it misses a lot of the playability of the first two). I actually found the game too easy if anything.\n\nPros: Graphics A++++, mostly good fun. Level editor. It's a cheap game (esp on sale).\n\nCons: A little short (5-6 hours), missing level up RPG with character powers. Puzzles not up to T1/T2 (prob because characters are missing skills).

And i have completed all 3 of them 100%. After the end of trine 3 i was dissapointed. and then i saw the video with what the developers had to say about trine 3. It was painful to watch. really. BUT. Given the case they actually tried their best and they moved the game to a 3D platform, and they where on a budget and they actually had the scenario and more levels already designed, i think its actually a misunderstood game.  I really hope it makes it for a continuation, and if it actually makes it I have to point out some parts that were missing.  Just a word from a fan.\n1) make less pointless little side quests and make the main story bigger. everyone prefers this. then you can make a dlc full of side quests. i promise you i will buy it.\n2) make the characters upgradable again. skill point actually was something interesting and funny, and made you try harder to pick up these triancles so you can upgrate. now you had to leave your main quest and search for those things.\n3) please add "view angle" because sometimes its quite difficult to actually realize where your character goes.\n4) and make the storyteller more "sonorous". more serious, as if this is a great matter hes talking about.\n5) and continue the hard job.!\n\n|p.s. by the way the music is beautiful.!

Moving it to 3D didn't really work out at all -- I was constantly fighting the 3D because I was never sure where things were, and I haven't even gotten anywhere in the combat challenge for Amadeus.\n\nAlso, they cut off the story abruptly, then added filler material. The combat challenges in particular are annoying; I believe those are the only levels that I haven't done (yet?).\n\nAs for the characters -- they didn't just forget all their skills like they did in Trine 2 -- this time around, they never gained skills either. A positive aspect, in some way, is that all puzzles are trivial.\n\nThe story itself -- I didn't like it. Not the abrupt ending but the actual content. I never pictured the three as *really* wanting to get rid of the Trine, so the whole thing felt contrived throughout\n\nNow, unfortunately, you can only vote "yes" and "no" -- there is no middle ground. The game is weak compared to its predecessors, sometimes even annoying, but it's not "bad". So I still give it "yes", but if you haven't played the other two: start with those.

Also this game has no skills levels, no extra skills (plank, ice arrows etc are gone). The levels are pretty easy and the "puzzles" are repetitive. There's no more healing or xp for killing monsters so you might as well just run past them. Each character heals to full health after taking no damage for a while. It's just not challenging or engaging. And the game ends in the middle of the story.","March 10","false","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After playing Trine 2 with friends and loving it, we decided to try out Trine 3.\n\nI got a bad feeling as soon as I learned there was no skill system, and from there the game got worse. In the first mission, we experienced a bug where only the host could see the animation of a puzzle, making me and my other friend useless in it. (Un)fortunately, it seems that all 3 characters now can do essentially the same things, making the puzzle possible even though only one person could interact with it. The addition of a third dimension (while adding depth to gameplay in some ways) mostly just made the controls a mess.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this game is that if you liked the Trine series for the aesthetic, you will enjoy this game as it improves upon the graphics of the previous installments. However, if you liked Trine for the mayhem and fun that came from playing with your friends, it probably isn't worth a buy.\n\nI know that I only have around an hour of this game on record, and I think that that's an important thing to note when reading this review.Maybe I judged this game too quickly, but I'm not going to waste anymore time on a buggy, mechanicly void platformer.","December 28, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You don't even fight the main antagonist so you can basically assume about 1/2 to 1/3 of the game is missing.  So it's essentially a 6 hour game.\n- I think they did an ok job with the controls considering, but you die ALOT to falling off things because it's hard to judge depth in a 3D game with a fixed camera, you have infinite resses basically unless all your party dies so it's really pretty hard to even fail this game.\n- There also seems to be far less puzzle solving than in previous games and much easier, a few times I literally said "is that it" when you put 3 boxes on 3 tiles to open a door.\n_ The characters have been stripped down of abilities, the magician can only summon one box, no planks even, the archer basically just shoots a normal arrow and can tie off objects, the knight is the person you use most of the time, he's really the only character that can fight and has the ability now to charge and do aoe stun attacks\n\nI bought this on sale for $5 and really that's all it's worth, a 6/10 is generous, there's too much missing to really give it a better score compared to previous trine games, if you like trine give it a go but don't expect much.\n( i have finished the game, time played is wrong, so I didn't just play this game for 30 mins and give it a review)","December 27, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Platforming isn't easy as fighting. You cannot realy see what are you pointing. The story is okey nothing amazing. Voice acting is on a high level and I love the conversations that the heros have.

Really, the game ends just when you think you've finished chapter 1.\n\nAlso, it's very different from the previous two.  It's much more a 3D platformer, where depth has a meaning. That's both good and bad. It's good because it's more interesting, but sometimes it's just annoying, since you can't move the camera.\n\nThis one is also prettier than the first two, which were also very pretty themselves.
