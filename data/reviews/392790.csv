Since it appeared I was only playing the classic version because the original one became to overwhelming and time consuming for me.\n\nI had some doubts at first thinking that it would be harder to play this version on PC, but it seems to be working fine and I get the same entertainment for a cheaper price.\n\nThumbs up, SI.","December 15, 2015","true","526.0"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","21","23","2","0"

It is football manager classic with a few improvements this year. I have only played 'classic mode' for the last few years as the main game has become far too bloated with nonsense while classic is more like the CM/FM i played for many years. So instead of having to pay £35 for the full game i am happy to just pay £20 as i only play classic anyway.","December 2, 2015","true","39.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

This brings back the fun, with just enough micromanagement to keep it from being an arcade game.

Accrington had expensive and better players, and I knew I would have to spend a full 90 minutes micro-managing the match to get the best out of my team against the odds, because my assistant manager wasn't qualified enough to make the right calls by himself.\n\nAnd I did it. By using a super defensive tactic, capitalising on the referee's lenient attitude, and hitting the opposition on the counter, I nullified any advantages the better team had, and we won the game 2-0.\n\nFootball Manager Touch is one hell of an amazing game. Despite being skinnier than the main version, it's still incredibly deep and very true to life. You are sincerely asked to exercise your knowledge of football with proper managerial skills, and ride the waves of success and defeat. You really do cheer when you win a career-defining game, and you really do throw something across the room when you lose them.\n\nI think it's more or less the best version of Football Manager too, because the game goes at a fast enough pace to feel like you're doing something, and you're not constantly babysitting your players. There are one or two areas where I may feel I would like more control (I would love to manually set up senior-youth tutoring, for example), but it's a compromise I'm generally happy with.\n\nI've only encountered one crash-to-desktop so far in my 90 hours of play time. It's a really stable game at the moment.\n\nEssentially, if you like football, if you fancy yourself a manager; if you enjoy building teams and you don't mind getting addicted to a new game, buy this one. Highly recommended!","May 5","true","116.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've played the mobile version a lot, and I have Football Manager 2014, and they're both great games. However, it's tough to play Football Manager 2014 on a smaller screen, even with a mouse. (I use a Surface Pro 2, so the screen is tablet-sized.) I assumed that Football Manager Touch 2016 would be the simplified, streamlined, "classic" game from full version but with modern, touch-friendly menus. Instead I was stuck using my pinky trying to touch menus with 8-point fonts. It looked like a great game, but I don't see how it's possible to play it without a mouse, even if you mess with the settings. I certainly couldn't play it sitting on the couch with a tablet.","December 1, 2015","false","3.1"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","14","26","3","0"

Football Manager Touch - slightly cheaper, still fun, not great for touch screens\n\n"Do you recommend this game?" is a tricky question seeing that it is undoubtably a good game. So why the thumbs down? Well, despite it's name, it really isn't optimised for touch screens. I play on my Surface 3, and for a start the on screen keyboard doesn't seem to work with the game, forcing me to use a proper keyboard. Also, a lot of the smaller buttons and scroll bars are just far easier to use with a mouse - it's not like the mobile version which is really easy to use on a touch screen. There are also frequent hints suggesting that you buy cheats such as "dodgy lasagne" to impair the other team - something that particulary grates with me.\nThe game is football manager classic - similar to the normal football manager except quicker and arguably less repetitive (no team talks or press conferences). You can still import kits, faces and tactics like the proper football manager.\nIt's still addictive and great fun for the football obsessed, and perhaps maybe a less daunting entry point for new players. But honestly, I can see no point in buying this version over the proper football manager (which includes a streamlined classic mode anyway), which is ultimately why I give it a thumbs down.","June 3","false","68.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
