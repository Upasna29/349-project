Your ship will automatically turn to face your opponent (manual aiming is possible with right stick), which makes matches more about positioning and prediction than twitch skills. Great party game, but probably not worth it for the single player.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xD89EImr2I","September 21, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

Out of absolutely nowhere, I will start moving right... it's impossible to say still. It persists indefinitely until either I ALT+TAB out and back into the game, (which causes it's own game-breaking bug as well, actually...) or restart the game. I can't give this a positive review until this gets fixed.","October 31, 2015","false","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I hope in the future more is done with this concept because altough the core of the game is interesting fresh I wish there was a little more ways to experence it instead of just duels with CPU. Now the lack of more ways to play is at no fault the game because what is offrered is great and enough to keep me happy for a long time to come I just love it so much that I wish there was more.\n\n","September 16, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Its addictive and the computer is no push over so the challenge keeps things interesting.  With different characters to choose from its allows you to fight from your style of play rather than just one i.e long range or speedy etc.  Definatly worth the money if this is your kind of thing and you can definatly kill some time with this game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMQhlfpFqEE","September 16, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"
