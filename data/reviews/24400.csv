I've been playing the game a lot recently, and am currently on my third time going through it (Played it on Easy and then Normal, and now on Hard).  Before I go on though, let me explain that when I play a game with as many options or adventure/story arcs that this game has to offer, I will milk it for all it's worth, and play the living H**L out of it, exhausting my options completely.  That being said, I've found a lot of enjoyment in this game, particularly since it revolves around King Arthur.\n\nAs a stand alone RTS, it is average.  The game play runs well, although I can understand others being frustrated with the speed (I'm just a very patient person, I guess.)  The choices you get in troops is wide ranged and very detailed.  The same goes for the Knights as well (although I find that there ought to be another 1 or 2 Warlord options).  When you've gotten the hang of balancing the Knights along with their strengths, it makes the game a lot easier (at least that was what I experienced during the Normal difficulty setting).\n\nWith items and weapons that become better through Battles, it quickly becomes  grindfest (which I find that people either love doing or hate doing.  Guess which group I fall under...? *lol*).  And with the options of releasing your prisoners to be left out on the map with a pittance of an army to build from again, it can easily become very manipulative and easy to "level up" your equipment.\n\nAll in all though, I have to say that I'm most impressed with the amount of depth the game has in terms of how many different adventures can be unlocked.  With the theoretical options of 4 different extremes you can take in this game, it opens up quite a bit of variety.\n\nSo if you're the kind of player who casually enjoys RTS, with the occasional grindfesting, this game is enjoyable.  Admittedly, my bias and love for King Arthur mythology allowed me to enjoy it more, but even to the casual RTS player, I think this game is fun.","January 13, 2014","true","168.5"," 72 of 75 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","72","75","3","0"

I love Total war to death (you can see I played shogun 2 for like 300+ hours) but I also love RPG’s like Dragon Age, Final Fantasy, and Skyrim, this was a very ambitious move on Neocore games and it very well paid off. Let me just go over the pros and cons\n\nPros:\n+ The Knights of the Round: Your Knights are basicly the generals from Total war only they are supped up can kick but and take names, much like an actual RPG character they level up, learn new skills, go on quests, and gain weapons and armor, Plus who always wanted their general to wipe out an entire platoon by firing a lightning bolt.\n+ Total War Mythology!?: Unlike in Total war this game features Creatures and monsters from various celtic mythos both evil and good….perhaps a new Age of Mythology is in order?\n+ RPG Quests: On the map you will encounter various RPG Text style quests that your knights can go on, to gain EXP, Units, Abilities, and so on, these are key to continue the story and earn better stuff as you conquer Britannia.\n+ Moral Alignment in Many Areas: Besides the Obvious Good and Evil (Righteous and Tyrant) there is also a Religious Alignment where you can either be a good Christian or continue the Old Ways, All Alignments have various benefits and you can go many ways like Tyrannical Christian or Righteous Old Ways ect.\n+Plays like Total war: If you love Total War it’s a very close replica of Total war, Granted it dose have a few flaws.\n+ Legendary Weapons and Armor: Collect Various Weapons and Armor to Deck out your Knights to make them more Lethal.\n\nCons:\n-	Your King Arthur…..and you don’t play as him??: Yeah despite you being King Arthur and having Excalibur “The Most Powerful Weapon in Britannia” You can’t actually use him in combat at all….or anything really…You can’t participate in Quests, or Join a Battle…Or Use Excalibur\n-	Can’t Get the TRUE Knights of the Round: I’m abit of a historic nut but I have to place this as a con, If your trying to do a play by play of the Actual Arturian Legend your SOL because of the Morality system a lot of the Classic Knights of the Round you cannot obtain, In my Case I was a Righteous Old Faith King sooo I couldn’t get Gawain or Gallahad because I wasn’t a Tyrant or a Christian\n-	Time Limit!?!?: Surprisingly there is a Time limit in the game by how many turns you can use, at a certain point in the game you will be unable to complete any more quests due to a event, hell you’ll skip several chapters if your too slow\n-	  Broken A.I: You HAVE to play this game on Easy, on Normal or Hard the A.I Breaks the game by producing units faster than you can and doing cheap tactics\n-	Auto Battle Whats That??: The Auto Battle is useless, forcing you to play every single battle!\n-	Reading…Zzzz: If you don’t like Reading your gonna fall asleep on some of the Quests\n-	Chapter Jumping: Your going to be jumping chapters like Crazy after Chapter 1, I haven’t even finished a quest for Chapter 2 and I already get Quests for Chapters 3 and 4\n-	Mythos Units OP: If you don’t have any Mythos Units your soldiers are going to get their buts kicked, Even the Lowest Teir Mythos Units can Own your Highest Teir Soldiers (Thus making you WANT to play Old Faith 80% of the time)\n\nIn the End though Despite my Cons its still a Solid Game Regardless it just needs some fine tuning here and there, If most of these Cons are Fixed in Future Titles then King Arthur can be a Legend, but for now it’s a Ambitious Title that Works but could use some Improvements\n\nScore: C-\n","November 10, 2014","true","50.5"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","44","53","0","0"

But it gets more frustrating with every hour that I play it.  And not because of any sort of fairly designed challenge.\n\nStarting with the pros:\n\nThe environment of King Arthur is good.  And this game has RPG elements that give your kingdom more character than you get in Total War.  There are lots of these side quests that are kind of like those text choose your own adventure stories.  And you will get alignment points from them that will affect your kingdom and unlock powers and units.  That was the main draw that got me to play this game, and I'm not dissapointed in that regard.\n\nAnd the cons/long winded rant:\n\nThe design of this game is INFURIATING at times!\n\nTo start with, YOU CANNOT RECRUIT UNITS until you do the first story quest involving restoring excalibur's power.  This doesn't sound like a problem, and normally it wouldn't be in a tutorial where you aren't getting attacked yet.  However, before or right after you get that quest you get a prompt about this civil war that you need to pick a side on.  In ignorance you might say "hey that sounds cool, let's do that first."  GOD HELP YOU if you do that because the units you lose picking a side you cannot replace.  Did the game tell me that I couldn't recruit until I did this quest?  NO!   I ended up restarting several times because I literally got wiped out of units and had no way to regain them.\n\nMaybe I just need to be more careful with conserving units?  Clearly this is just the rage of some guy who games from his parent's basement, and badly at that.   Well first, I game upstairs in my parents house, thank you.  Second, caring for your units is way easier said than done.  I could discuss how poorly the units handle, and the lack of army formations, but it doesn't matter.  Archers will SLAUGHTER your heavily armored troops, and cavalry will flank the archers.\n\nOh, did I mention cavalry?  Because you need to research to get that.  How do you research?  You have to conquer your way through or negotiate with kingdoms who all outnumber and outgun you to conquer a stronghold that gains you research points.  Until then enjoy the much faster mounted forces beating you to the victory points that you have to capture to help win.  Then assuming you survive that which I did, and you research some better units which I did, you may now enjoy the unfair realm of enemy magic.\n\nThree words.  Curse... of... Shadows.  It's a BS spell that can be cast halfway across the battlefield, and can strike a unit dead.  Or a group of units if you don't know it's coming.  Don't give me that nonsense about this being a strategy game and there being protection against magic.  The enemy on NORMAL difficulty should not have a superweapon level spell as early as late in Chapter 1 or Chapter 2.  PERIOD.  END OF STORY.\n\nAnd last but not least the RIDICULOUS extent to which you are outnumbered on the campaign.  After conquering more than half of Brittania your people will be going hungry to maintain three armies.  I am currently battling King Cedyrn or something like that to the west.  From an empire a third the size of mine IN THE MOUNTAINS, he has at least a half a dozen armies.  All of them are more powerful than mine.   Is he feeding them with virgins and magic beans.  Did he make a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to get more power.  Because if he did, ALL MAGIC HAS A PRICE!\n\nSo do I recommend this game?  As if anybody cares.  No I do not.  But I'm going to play it anyway.  I know I will.  Because it's Arthurian myth, and I want to see if I can get to the point where I can get mythical units and some of the really powerful magic.  That may be where the fun in this game is.  But right now, I'm just fried with this blatantly unfair experience.   Why do you hurt me like this developers?  Just why?","December 5, 2014","false","15.8"," 52 of 69 people (75%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","75","52","69","24","0"

It is a really challenging game that is best described as Total War - Fantasy.  The key tactical strategy on the battle maps is deciding when / how to use special abilities and spells.  There is not flanking or morale for individual units (there is an overall battle morale).  For $10 or less if you get it on sale the game should provide you with many hours of fun.\n\nIt has a nice story and allows you a few different ways to play (Rightful vs Tyrnat and Christian vs Old Faith).  Game is a lot of fun and I recomend it to anyone who is a fan of total war games (keeping in mind that it is almost 5 years old).\n\nAlso there are a number of people complaining that the game does not work or crashes a lot.  Just get the Demo to make sure it works for you.  I have played it on Win XP, Win 7, and Win 8.1.  On my most recent sting on Win 8.1 I have had 1 crash to desktop in about 18 hours played.","July 25, 2014","true","84.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It adds an awesome RPG and story based element to the strategy game genere and it is done quite well. Graphically, the game is quite beautiful and there is a nice variety of units and hero customization. That being said the game can be quite hard with the resource management and because of the somewhat linear story and function "time movement", you can feel rushed to complete missions and story objectives in time. The AI can also be quite brutal and you will have to control your armies in the field alot to even try to acheive virtocy without losing half your armies. Also your limit pool of heroes is quite small and you'll find yourself eventually dismissing heroes, you fought so hard to get in the beginning, as new ones appear. Some of the story missions become a wall of text and a type of 'Choose your own adventure" books, where a wrong decision can alter the outcome and hurt you in an upcoming battle.

I love the storyline and the concept but the game play is simply too difficult for this player accustomed to the normal or high difficulty levels of Total War games.","December 24, 2014","false","27.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Has good graphics, music, and voice acting. The combat is very cool with some unique elements such as heroes, spells, and capturable points that give your army bonuses in battle. However one glaring issue in the battle system is a complete lack of a morale system which means units will never retreat. As well as being unrealistic this means battles tend to drag on with the losing army ultimately being annihilated. This proves to an issue on the campaign map as the game is very difficult and one lost battle can be devastating since you are limited in the amount of troops you can support with your permenantly shaky economy. Disasters, rebellions, and invading armies are a constant nuisance which plays into the games difficulty as the quest system is the only way to advance the game and these elements take up time and prevent you from completing aforementioned quests. All the elements that you would expect in this genre of game are present as well as a nifty morality and religion system that determines what spells, units, and upgrades you can get as well as a text-based quest system that advances the main story. The story of course is based on King Arthur's rise to dominion over all of ancient England but with distinct fanstay elements based on old Celtic mythology. In conclusion I would recommend this to fans of the Total War series of games.","June 24, 2014","true","22.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Stack your army with these archers and its like stacking your army with those arab ninjas from Medieval 1 that could melee and range equally.

The bigest problem of the game ( and like only) is game mechanics. starts well isnt it?\nso total wars battle map is better than in KA-TRW. battles are not broken but are based on heroes ( the funny thing is that it is true to the lore, cause in legends heroes won the battles :)  ) and its not so strategical battle after all. Also eveling system of the units shakes a thing little( you can reaserch your troops to better troops. it changes they stats and how they look but it shakes much the game- but still to be able to play it with fun)\n\nlast thing is that you can only command one army during the battle. thats baaad... what else, ah yes. as long as computer make more mixed armies you can also make more fun based armies. but in the end you will fight against armies contained from best of the best units...and its boring and its SU***...\n\n-----so lets go to the better part of it:\n\natmosphere- it is greate! just grate you have to see on your own eyes.\n\ncampaign map- from mechanical point of view its not so grounf breaking. BUT!\nit is pteety open britan wher you can conquer all provinces make alliances and on the map you have quests. and those quest are heavily based on what you do on map and on all those little kingdoms you are surendered with. and the game makes you feel like errant knight going from one adventure to another.\n\nlook- the game looks good, the clone units are just anoying but still they look good, there is variaety of troops and heroes and everything is in motion.\n\nstory- the stories are what makes this game so good. every quest have its own storie and thanks to that even "pls go and kill bad guy" feels far more intresting.\n\ninterpretation- i think its a great interpretation og King arthurs legends\n\n-------------------------so i would give the game like 7.5/10 cause mechanics are not to good and since battles should be the best part of the game due to mechanics they are not.\n\n\n","December 3, 2013","true","101.4"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

In this case, it's a pretty good thing, since the strategic element is pretty well-done and the infusion of a fantasy setting based around the Arthurian legend definitely breathes some life into the somewhat stale historical Total War formula. That said, it's definitely not as good as the Total War games, but it's also definitely worth checking out if you've been wanting a fantasy Total War title.","February 13, 2011","true","14.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has great kingdom management and awesome troop building. But it's so ♥♥♥♥ing hard. It begins by being laughably easy and then game's difficulty spikes through the roof. The RTS battles become nigh on impossible to win. There's a morale mechanic in the battles that tick down for both sides either as you engage the enemy or capture points. This sounds like a great idea, but it's awful. The maps are horribly unbalanced, forcing you to engage the enemy head on instead of taking a strategic position and lying in wait for them. The game outside of the battles isn't much better either. You'll never get a chance to replenish your armies because you'll always be fighting something. The game forces you into battles non-stop. Aside from that, there are text-based quests you find on the world map which are pretty enjoyable. There's also a kingdom management bit where you get to construct buildings, tax your peasants and research tech, but you only get to do that during the winter, the rest of your time in the game being spent hating your life as you hopelessly try to fight the AI's armies. Overall, this game is an RTS masachist's haven, but for the casual player, I would suggest you avoid this like the plague. It's simply ridiculously hard.

You have the option of annihilating the enemy army, or capturing the victory locations (which give you buffs when you own them).  The strategic map allows you to move your armies around and have "adventures", which are basically text based challenges.  These can sometimes result in battle, or they may just be a simple trade opportunity.  Managing your empire is pretty complex because you can assign different knights to be liege lords to different provinces.  This impacts taxes and food production.  Your armies can level and your knights can level.\n\nIt's a really well done, damn fun game.  And it's cheap.","January 20, 2015","true","76.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In mideval times archers were damn effective at hailing down hell on armies. In reality this makes sense but this is a game and the difficulty presented causes the game to be a bit unbalanced.\nAlso, autoresolving battles is an option, but it is not ever wise to do so until very late in the campaign.\n\nAside from those issues this game is amazing and I am very much looking forward to the sequel.

In reality this makes sense but this is a game and the difficulty presented causes the game to be a bit unbalanced.\nAlso, autoresolving battles is an option, but it is not ever wise to do so until very late in the campaign.\n\nAside from those issues this game is amazing and I am very much looking forward to the sequel.

You have the option of annihilating the enemy army, or capturing the victory locations (which give you buffs when you own them).  The strategic map allows you to move your armies around and have "adventures", which are basically text based challenges.  These can sometimes result in battle, or they may just be a simple trade opportunity.  Managing your empire is pretty complex because you can assign different knights to be liege lords to different provinces.  This impacts taxes and food production.  Your armies can level and your knights can level.\n\nIt's a really well done, damn fun game.  And it's cheap.","January 20, 2015","true","76.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
