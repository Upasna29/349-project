"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jungul/recommended/337760/","jungul","[Packadermz] QLONE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jungul/","470 products in account","Disclaimer: I've owned this game for quite a long time, well before it became available on steam. I've put literally hundreds of hours into it, so the time shown in my steam profile isn't reflective of my experience with the game.\n\nThis is one of, if not the best operational level wargames I've played. It's the next logical step up in complexity for people who are comfortable with games like Panzer Corps, Unity of Command and Commander: The Great War. It is both realistic and complex, yet still accessible with a rather gentle learning curve. That said, Blitzkrieg from Warsaw to Paris is quite deep, and you'll be learning something new about the system with each campaign you play.\n\nIncluded with the game is the 1939 invasion of Poland, the invasion of France and the Low Countries and a hypothetical invasion of Great Britain. There are other minor scenarios available, and tons of variants to keep things interesting and unpredictable. There are also elements to the gameplay like playing decision cards which make Blitzkrieg from Warsaw to Paris unique among its contemporaries.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is interested in wargames and ready for a greater challenge (HQs, supply and logistics, etc.) than what is available in more introductory level wargames. Blitzkrieg from Warsaw to Paris presents these more complex concepts in an approachable and elegant manner, resulting in a rewarding and thoroughly enjoyable wargame experience.","January 22, 2015","true","0.1"," 139 of 153 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","139","153","0","0"

There is no standard interface for this kind of war game, so you need a good tutorial on how to set up attacks, get supply status etc.  The icons are pretty clear for what they are doing and you get visual feedback on how your attacks went and why.\n\nAnother good sign is you can let the AI run longer so it can find better moves.\n\nIF the AI is good I will add to this review.  As of now, if you like wargames it is worth a try.","January 25, 2015","true","1.2"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","0"

Even after losing first campaign in Poland by 3 points. Always one more turn. The unique play makes it very interesting. I consider it one of the better operational level games I have played in a while. More meat than Unity of Command, yet not a huge learning curve either. Just have to think about what you want to do and how to do it without a lot of casualties and in the fastest amout of time. It is tough.\nI recommend it highly, but wait till a sale. It is a older game and not worth $40. I found it hard to even pay $19.99, but it has been worth it so far.  Be prepared to spend a lot of time with it thinking "what If I moved here.....: or "what is in that hex".

I hope this sells well, because Matrix needs to put more titles on Steam, at these great prices.  I never try these games because they're too expensive to try from their website.\n\nThe author of this title is really involved in the community.  There are a couple graphical overhauls that update the maps and unit graphics really nicely.  I'm really getting into the first scenario, which is exciting.  I have had every Hearts of Iron, and I love those games, but to be honest I haven't been able to really play them.  This game is very playable, and gives me hope that I'll be able to better tackle HoI in the future.","January 26, 2015","true","70.8"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

Nothing like having 7 idiots try and cooperate to barely conquer Poland.\n\nThere are a ton of number, but overall integrity and readiness should be enough for most people.

The in-game tutorial gets you started, but if you don't go through the manual you're going to screw up.  Maintaining operational and support channels from OKH to divisional units is at first frustrating, and a bit of a learning curve, but you were the one who wanted to invade Poland.  The game makes sure you can get the gas, bullets, and beans where it needs to go, but you're the one who needs to include those logistics in your strategy.\n\nHappily. once you get it, IT really comes together and you can get on to wrestling with the issue of conquering Western Europe.  The Sealion scenario, and linking Case White, Case Yellow, and Sealion into an extended unified campaign is brilliant.","April 29","true","4.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"
