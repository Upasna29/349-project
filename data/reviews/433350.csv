It's not, it's not good now and never will be.  I knew from the moment I saw the tutorial helper it was going to be bad, but i didn't know it would be "Pay money to kill random players that have an honest interest in your game" bad.

There were only a few exceptions like Sniper:Ghost Warrior MP. It was a sniper fun game but with utterly bad graphics. Blackshot is even worse in graphics. Honestly it looks very outdatet and somewhere was written it's a CS 1.7 mod.\n\nMainly there are other issues you'll encounter:\n- intransparent weaponshop & skilltree,\n- not understandable daily rewards system,\n- secret uplevel system,\n- unbalanced teams,\n- P2W elements and last but not least\n- a lot of cheaters/hackers.\n\nTho there was this overly hot guide Ellie in the beginning but I cannot remember anything ... And the functions are not explained anywhere else.\n\nThe basic concept is that all of your weapons expire in 3 gamehours. Then you can restock them with BSP (Blackshot points) or buy other game contents upto 30 hours endurance with BSC (Blackshot Credits). Mostly last is the reason when you meet ppl with one-shot-kill weapons or enemy pointer system. So the cheating seems to be incorporated into this game with a P2W part. Not to speak of the devs rely just on an useless ACS nProtect Software and don't have mods active kicking the massive cheaters out of sessions.\n\nOnce I got randomly a smileyface mask. I didn't use it but somehow it got expired after 1 hour of gameplay. So what? Is there anymore interest in cosmetical upgrades after that?\n\nIt's a little pity that they do have interesting locations like Rio or Mount St. Michel for example. I also enjoyed gamemodes like "Protect the Commander" or "Running man".\nBut the game lacks entirely in so many points.\n\nHopefully they will not extend the low test achievements. Because if you have rankedup like me servers really got empty and the last in-game achievements promise you a lot of brainless grinding.","June 5","false","17.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","6"

So lets begin the game would be a really good PVP game if they get rid of the who has a better weapon then you wins type of deal or what everybody calls pay to win, the weapons skill ranking is cool and would be successful if not for the pay to win weapons for example today i played snipers only i got some kills with my SR but when i kill the guy that kill me so many times and i killed him once so i pick up his SR which is the same SR i have but in a gold skin camo and i went to town with it 10 kills in a row so yes pay to win game die quick because they lack skill based gameplay. All players like skill based games why because skill based is based on the skill of the player and not there wallet. Also pay to win games are unbalanced.

Now lets get to the gameplay, the graphics are similar to old CS, but be forewarned don't play the A.I mode, absolute ♥♥♥♥, most of the A.I come out bugged looking like triangle bodies, seems like a sixth grader did some of the designs in it, but the other modes are what you would expect in a FPS, in my experience in the beginner channel, i had no crashes or "Hack detected" but others have said they have, no clue what caused them to experience it, now mind you this game has tons of bugs, ie weapon switching gets delayed or doesn't even work at times, and grenades hitting you through walls at times. I only saw 2 blatant hackers in the beginners channel while i played. Now we move on to the normal channels, I played 2 games in the channel and it made me want to just dump this game from my library and never touch it again, 1st game their were 8 hackers and in the 2nd it seemed like the entire room besides myself and another were hacking. Now their is no option to report people for hacking, in-game or out, you have to go to their steam profile to report them to steam, so the game devs give absolutely no ♥♥♥♥♥ about the community so long as their making money. GMs will do nothing for you, and will even go to accusing you of tampering with a SS and ban you. So I recommend you look elsewhere for a decent FPS game.","June 4","false","9.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

There were especially players of the same clan who played together in a map just to kick out the good players, you weren't able to play a normal match until you found a good room with friendly persons. Another reason I dislike this game is the support team, they ban people for stupid reasons (I didn't use any hacktool, but my account with many hours of gameplay still received a ban). In this game, multi accounts are forbidden if they are linked to different emails, but one can buy a special feature called 'character slot' to play with multiple accounts. I didn't want to buy this slot and created my accounts otherwise, so I got permanently banned. They kinda force you to pay in, because you have many disadvantages without cashed stuff (better stats than the non-cash stuff=> Pay2Win). What is the matter about having several accounts while others play with wallhacks or macros? The Gamemasters can be called clowns, they ignore most of the questions.They are just worth to be answered if you pay for their system. Don't make the same mistake as me by wasting hundreds or maybe even thousands of hours unless you want to feed the pay2win system.","June 1","false","0.3"," 31 of 49 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","31","49","0","1"

Literally EVERYONE knows this doesn\'t work on many levels.\n-The developers of this game seem to be heavily influenced by Counter Strike and wether thats a good thing or a bad thing is up to you.\n+At least the guns have pretty good variety.\n-Graphics obviously look poor and blood highly unrealistic, but hey you could have gotten that from the screenshots.\n+At least the guns have decent graphics.\n+As far as good things I can say about this game is at least it works, surprisingly. I haven\'t ran into any server disconnects and I doubt there will be any lag issues on the game\'s end, considering they only need enough server power for like the 10 people that are going to play this game.\n-Like 10 people will play this game.\nSo to wrap up if you want a game to quickly pick up and drop this is a somewhat good game to do so, waste an afternoon or play for a weekend.

(You will learn how to play, just be patient and don't be a ragy flaming kid and don't accuse players of hacking/bugusing when they are just better than you, instead you could just tell them on all chat that they are good)\n\nPS: You will know when someone is hacking/bugusing.

Well lets keep the long story short! If you don't mind graphics from 2002-2003 the game is solid. I was running around and it didn't happen that I kill traded, guns are easy to master and balanced, snipers are not to OP, and premium weapons only look good because otherwise they are not game changers. Who has the fastest reactions and best aim will always win. Okay some maps are borderline spawn camping sometimes but again if you learn the map you can fix that problem with good aim :). the game modes are fun especially running man. That game mode is reason enough to try this game out!\n\nOnly thing that I could consider as "bad" are the graphics. Now don't get me wrong I'm not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ but still I mean they are a little bit btter then CS 1.6. Not as old but not as new aswell. Good thing about that is then it can run on everything from the year 2005 and above :D.\n\nGameplay like said is soild ! :D\nWould give this game a 8/10","June 6","true","2.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Your problem will be solved asap.\n\nSecond of all, a lot of people are complaining about the amount of hackers. Of course there are currently some hackers, I'm not going to lie, but this is just a matter of time.

It will be way easier for you if you play this game for the first time ! I also recommend you to check the Blackshot forum (with the link above) and check the "Tips and Tactics" section of the forum.

I don't, however.\nYes, servers are hard to get in and sometimes players are far and few between, but the game isn't bad in itself.\nThe connection, at least on my end seemed pretty bad. Reloading was delayed, and not instantaneous, the ironsights are horrific on one of the SMG's, and the players... aren't very talkative. Yes, its also incredibly pay to win.\nBased on these facts, i'll let you guys make your decision about whether or not to install this, but I find it hard to recommend, but hard to not recommend. Almost wish steam had a Eh... button in between Yes and No when recommending games.\nSo I guess, I can't really recommend it.","June 4","false","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I seen how it was old and immediately had to play it. Usually old school shooters are fun to play and arent as much as a blood bath as COD or BF. But boy was I wrong. This game has blood out the ying yang, and of course the gun selection of CSGO. Here is the pros and cons I have found so far:\nPROS: The Game is fun.\nBlood squirts everywhere\nThe gun sound effects and grenade blasts literally blast my ear off.\nThe visuals are decent for a game that is really old.\n\nCONS: The game stutters\nif you have too high fps, you will experience stuttering. I get around 140-220 fps and it stutters nearly everytime I shoot the shotgun. It may have to do with multiple cores.\nThere are several times the inconsistencies with the aiming and shooting routine within the game. I have shot at a person, and somehow, being up close, still misses them!\nthe game runs at a very low resoultion and at 4:3 aspect ratio.\nand of course, the big one for me, I NEED GRAPHICS OPTIONS!\nHopefully you found this review helpful for you all with gaming pcs that are looking for bloody shooters.","June 1","true","1.8"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","7","17","2","1"

Not like you HAVE to spend money to get kills. Just grab and "AWP" or any other sniper and don't miss. Sniping is probably more fun than using "regular" guns anyway. I've played a LOT of "pay 2 win" games my most played being "Blockade 3D" and this really isn't anywhere near that. Sure you can buy guns but you cant keep them unless you wanna pay over and over. Like I said before just get a sniper and you're good to go. Most players are using snipers anyway so im surprised it isn't called "AWP simulator". I personally think this game is ok. Not the best game I've ever played, but much better than lots of other games out there I've played. It's very much like CS:GO in a lot of ways. In fact that's the first game I thought of when I first switched guns. One thing I don't really like is that some maps (I've only played 2 so far) are very much one sided, meaning if you spawned on the other side you'll be sniped very easy since one side is perfect for "head glitching" which I ended up going like 35-5 or something like that. You'll know what im talking about when you play it. Not sure about "matchmaking" or balance issues since I have very little time played but it all really depends on what you're willing to go through in order to become "good" at the game. It's a bit frustrating but it can have it's moments. With all that being said I'd give this game a good 6/10. *Waits for angry replies*","June 3","true","2.3"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","39","7","18","3","0"

But it still has it cons for example you have to rent guns for a some time like a hour or 7 days or even a month. I really dislike this, but the currency in the game is easily gained. Also another horrible feature that need to be fixed is the jumping it's soooo buggy.

Have made it to Staff Sergeant rank and played multiple maps and game modes. It's not a bad game. It's not a great game, but it just came out and has some bugs to work out. a few of those would be:\n1-Grenades are a little wonky. Sometimes they kill you from fifteen feet away, other times your opponent survives a near direct blast.\n2- Health vs damage/armor. I put this one here because I can empty a clip at times, point blank, and they survive, yet they hit me once with the same weapon and it's instakill.\n3- Movement and cover could be a little better. It tends to be slow to move and turn (I play ith max mouse sensitivity).\n\nWhile some out there will say I'm complaining and should just "get Better," bite me.

The game has a lot of potential, but it lacks..... I\'m not even sure right now.\n\nThis game doesn\'t have to fit everyone\'s standards and the game is fun. Although (to me felt kind of awkward at first) you begin to enjoy the game for what it is. I can\'t complain about a game that just came out, so I don\'t feel as if anything\'s wrong. The game feels like (any)Counter Strike, but has a weird feeling of Metal Gear Solid for some weird reason. But anyways, with time this review may change, it may not, but one things for sure is that the game is free and if you want a cheap Counter Strike knock-off, play this, or spend your money over to the Devs at CS/Valve. If you are going to play this, I would recommend it if you would want to boost your ego then play CSGO afterwards  :P  .","June 1","true","0.7"," 13 of 40 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","13","40","3","1"

Just another FPS that pops up for a bit then dissapears. its the same old maps reused from other games. the audio is very muddy and awful. with the weapons incredibly unblanced. The shotguns are like SMGs the SMGs are like bb guns the aussault rifles are more like sniper rifles and the sniper rifles are more like aussault rifles. You can only rent guns with the in game currency also. and just like many other shooters the game has over sexualized female models. Its just sad. The graphics would be impressive if it were 2001. But now their they muddy and watery and ugly. even the blood textures are terrible. This game should have never been added to steam at all. This game would be better as a Browser based FPS than a full download.","June 3","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is pretty bad, like I mean bad.... The graphics are pretty bad, controls are horrible, there is no "weapon control", you can even zoom in even though your weapon has iron sights and stuff... Takes half a clip of a M4 to kill someone... Its just bad. I wouldnt even waste time or hard drive space downloading/playing this game.. its the bad lol. Like I dont write reviews, I dont. This game is that bad. I would rather play any other F2P FPS over this, like any.","June 5","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
