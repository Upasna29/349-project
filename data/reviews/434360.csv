"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silversuriv/recommended/434360/","silversuriv","silversuriv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silversuriv/","1360 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nProvided by Giveaways Reborn !\nPortable DescriptionCurrently in an alpha state, Kitten Rampage is a kitten simulator reminiscent of a similar game of the goat variety that offers destruction at an epileptic level with an aside to scatological (toilet) humor.\n\nGameplaySeizures Warning\nIt is important to understand that this game may induce epileptic seizures. The warning is hidden in the extended “About This Game” section in the Store page and the game fails to emphasize this upon launching. Kitten Rampage utilizes strobing lights upon shooting (which is almost always consistently activated), and the explosions present variations of intense particle effects.\n\nObjectives\nKitten Rampage offers 4 main game modes: Time Trial, Free Roam, Expert, and Survival. Each mode contains a set of objectives that must be completed in order to clear the level. Some of these objectives may be achieving a certain score, killing a number of enemies or reaching a location. Throughout the game, there is also a hunger, thirst and health meter that “needs” to be maintained. The objectives are attained with the help of two shooting weapons that can fire simultaneously and indefinitely. Grenades can also be “puked” out for higher firepower. There are only 12 achievements in this game and most of them can be attained in half an hour.\n\nLevel Design\nThe maps and levels in Kitten Rampage are pretty generic, utilizing ordinary objects and locales. Often times, there is a lot of empty space making traversal a bit of a chore. Also, the sprint button cannot be toggled, a much needed quality of life improvement, making most of the gameplay uncomfortable from constant pinky usage.\n\nSome of the objectives, such as killing X enemies, get extremely tedious due to the level design. Some rooms seem hidden, and many buildings blend into the background making these enemies annoying to track down. Having to redo levels due to the inability to discover the last couple enemies is extremely frustrating. A time bonus mechanic upon killing an enemy would help remedy this.\n\nPresentationGraphics\nThe graphics and aesthetics for Kitten Rampage are really poor. Stock assets were used, and the objects seem too two-dimensional. Upon closer observation, most of the repeated patterns that the assets utilize are either color gradients or basic low quality textures (no shading/light variation). There aren’t any thematic colors or styles used to decorate the levels either. The kitten can, however, be personalized to an extent (fur/eye color).\n\nPhysics Engine\nThe physics engine is also pretty poor in this game. Clipping occurs everywhere, collision detection makes no sense and object disintegration are too similar which each other. Everything seems to be made up of flat panels or boxes, as observed upon destruction. Portions of the level can cause the kitten to clip so badly that it will get permanently stuck.\n\nConclusionCurrent State of the Game\nAlthough the game has not been released for long, the patches seemed to have waned from launch. For a developing game in Early Access (especially one that is in its alpha stages), it is crucial to be transparent with future content. The developer(s) do seem to take part in the Steam Discussions board; however, there hasn't been any updates for quite some time. Currently, there seems to be no one playing Kitten Rampage, according to Steam's community statistics. With such a strong similarity to another certain animal simulator, and having the same price, it will be very difficult to grow the player base without a lot more content/refinements added.\n\nVerdict\nIt is imperative for any simulator to have a strong physics engine and intriguing maps along with an ample amount of varied goals/objectives/achievements to add longevity to the game and improve re-playability. This game has neither, making it very difficult to find an audience that can manage to overlook the frustrating bugs and tedious nature of the gameplay in order to enjoy Kitten Rampage.\n\nFollow Giveaways Reborn curator for more reviews\nThis game has been given away in Giveaways Reborn","June 3","false","0.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It is fun to create havoc in the human world.\n\nKitten Rampage is an action / cat simulator game where you play a fluffy, little white cat and your goal is to destroy as many things as possible with your laser beams and bullets from your mini gun. This game is currently under development, but you will be able to play a couple of missions. In the first one, you will have a time limit to destroy as much as possible and achieve given objectives. The second one is pretty much the same without the time limit.\n\nThe game play is really fun, as you go on a rampage and literally ravage the household and it occupants (they are actually agents). You will be able to Meow, sit, jump and of course poop in your litter. If you can’t find your litter . . .  don’t worry, you can poop everywhere! As you know by now, you will be using laser beams and a mini gun but . . . you can puke grenades for good measure - let me tell you, you are going to laugh playing this game!  You will see your kitten in a third cat (person) perspective and you will need to make sure it eats and drinks well during your rampage. And, as you are a very clever kitten, you will be able to enter cars and drive them around the house. Also, with each Great Kill, 1 second will be added to your time limit.\n\nGraphically, it is nice (still in development). Nice soundtrack too. The controls could be better but overall they are ok.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Fun gameplay and interesting concept\n-	Nice graphics\n-	Plenty of explosions\n-	Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Repetitive\n\nKitten Rampage shows great potential, it is fun and will give you the giggles more than once. I can’t wait to see new levels.\n\n7.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

It's a pretty crude destruction sandbox, full of random objects and creatures. There are no meaningful game mechanics, there is nothing interesting about the world, nothing to explore. You are a demigod kitten that spawns bullets and/or lasers from her eyes and destroys everything. It's not challenging, it's just random - and not the good Monty Python random, just plain illogical nonsense.\n\nI don't have a problem with the game itself, I just think that 10$ is a pretty hefty price for what it offers. But that is what everyone has to decide for themselves.\n\nI am fully aware that someone spent time and effort in creating an edgy weird, over-the-top game, but without any meaningful gameplay mechanics, challenging goals or actual humor (other than random pictures from the internet on the walls), I can absolutely not recommend to get this game. Maybe watch a Let's Play of someone to get an idea what I am talking about.\n\nI hope that the developer will work more on the actual game and not only throw more content on it. Explosions are fun, but not when it makes absolutely no sense or is not challenging whatsoever.","February 8","false","0.8"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","17","33","0","0"

The aim of the game is to conquer the world and become the deadliest\nkitten alive. The game is fun, silly and broken in all the right ways (similar to games\nsuch as Goat Simulator.)\n\nFeatures\n\nThe game is a very fun and easy way to pass the time. The wonky physics of the game can\ncause some huge laughs and the 'acceptable' graphics add to this effect. The games controls\nare pretty awkward and may cause some difficulty to some players. The game also includes\nvehicles which at times add to gameplay but can be buggy. The game does suffer from pretty\nfrequent fps issues which can break up gameplay at times.\n\nPros:\nFun And Interesting Gameplay\nOkay Looking Graphics\nLots Of Laughs\nCool Vehicles\nCons:\nWonky Controls\nFPS Issues\nMissions Can Sometimes Be Repetitive\nAlot Of Bugs And Glitches\n\nSummary:\nThis is a silly and fun game which will entertain you for many hours and allow you to have\nmany good laughs. It is very buggy and broken in places, but this is most likely because\nit is still in early development.\n\nRating:\n\n6.5 / 10\n\nWant more recommendations?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/434360/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2516 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Note: Kitten Rampage is currently in Early Access. The version reviewed was 0.145.\n\n"Invade and Persuade with cuteness and cuddles."\n\nKitten Rampage is first-person shooter with you playing a kitten bent on mindless destruction using your twin lasers and chaingun. No, I'm not sure where a kitten got twin lasers and a chaingun either.\n\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - Graphics are relatively simple, but do the job they're supposed to. Everything looks reasonable, although I didn't see any fancy effects or anything like that. And there's some very weird scaling: ducks as big as people and a wolf as big as a car.\n\nAs far as settings go, it's another Unity game, so the standard Unity settings are available: detail level settings from 'Fastest' to 'Fantastic', resolution settings, and the like. FPS was mostly good, although I experienced a little bit of stutter in some situations. I would expect a more powerful system than my laptop to have no problems whatsoever.\n\nSound - The first thing I noticed was the menu music: a rock riff played over and over again. It was mindless, but okay, and set the scene for the rest of the game. Within the game you can currently select from five soundtracks, but they're all a bit samey, with obvious rock and metal influences. Still, the choice is definitely appreciated. Sound effects are functional, with lasers 'zapping' and chaingun 'budda-budda-ing'. Your kitten's meow is pretty cute, too.\n\nGameplay - Typical WASD first-person shooter gameplay, but with a kitten as the protagonist. You choose a level (this version only has one time-trial level available, plus a free-roam version of the same, but from the menu options it looks like there will be seven in total, with both time-trial and free-range options for each) and then you run around destroying all of the objects in the environment. And that's pretty much it at the moment.\n\nThe level so far implemented has a number of goals to reach in the set time limit, with available time being increased by a couple of seconds with each object you destroy. There are some 'agents' that walk around the level, but other than that everything is static. The level includes vehicles that can be controlled (how!?), but so far there is little point in commandeering one except for a brief change of pace.\n\nYour kitten has food, drink, and health indicators, but other than food and drink decreasing steadily and being renewed with collectibles from within the level, they don't seem to do very much yet. I'd like to see a bit more variation than just running around mindlessly destroying stuff, and some enemies to avoid as well, but hopefully they're on the way.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ original themed FPS with some weird ideas\n+ developers have a clear path laid out for improvement and addition of gameplay\n+ developers are actively fixing bugs and working on content\n\nCons:\n- not much to do yet; only one level\n- no plot to speak of; gets repetitive once you've achieved the stated goals\n- a couple of crashes, some minor grammar errors in the menus\n- grenades are pointless and cause very little damage\n- Steam achievements don't seem to work\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================For a game that makes no sense at all, Kitten Rampage is kinda fun. There's not a lot to do yet, but the developers are active. Recommended if you're into weirdo FPS games and don't mind taking a punt on another Early Access title. Otherwise, you might want to wait and see where the developers take this one.\n\n5/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","February 4","true","1.1"," 16 of 44 people (36%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","36","16","44","5","3"
