I don't believe you can get that unless you invest your own funds and support developers, and provide a personal sense of "value".\n\nThis has got to be one of the more enjoyable solitaire card games on the market. I have put over 52 hours into this addicting game. It has a fun background story (which does not interfere with the game play, but merely keeps you involved to continue on your journey), relaxing music, and simple mechanics with fun powerups to assist you along the way. A good value at its current asking price of $10, but I think as a casual game, I would wait for it to be on sale for around $5. It has achievements, trading cards, and is guaranteed to waste a LOT of your time if you are a fan of Faeries whatsoever.\n\nThere are quickplay levels and extra hard challenge levels if you finish or need a break from the Adventure campaign.\n\nIf you have this in your library and haven't tried it out yet, you're missing out on a gem.\nI read a review once that downvoted this because of no multiplayer option ... This is "Solitaire" ... Enough said LOL.\n\nI wanted to add an edit into this:\nIf you are an achievement hunter, be forewarned that you have to collect a lot of materials and eggs while you play. This, of course, is governed by random odds. You may have to play quite a bit more to collect all the items you need, and several speculations and theories are presented in the forums.\n\nA report on the randomness: After this review, and having put an extra ten hours here and there into this fun game, I am *still* working on the last two achievements.\n\nGood hunting! :)","July 2, 2015","true","62.0"," 53 of 60 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","53","60","6","3"

I love the randomness of the game, compared to traditional solitaire, and the objectives change things up from hand to hand as well.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the theme, honestly, I think the artwork and story is a little trite and the voice acting is downright cringeworthy. Some of the upgrade perks can be nice but the pets are pretty useless. I also wish I could change the aspect ratio or at least resize the window since I play in windowed mode usually.\n\nThe game itself, however, keeps me playing for just one more hand. Or 20 more hands. Or hey when did it get so late is it really 1 am?\n\nIt might also be the hunt for that last egg, which after nearly 50 hours and 4-5 complete playthroughs still will not drop.

(You must pay $1 or more to get a Steam key and trading cards BTW)\n\nAnyways, this game is a great time waster and well made. Just some good old solitaire with a bunch of additions to make it a different kind of game with tons of levels.\n\nBesides the regular games there are several modes to play and you can obtain pets by finding eggs raise and other unlock bonuses in Faerie Land that help make your a better player and get better scores. The pets don't do much other than to have something extra in the game for you to do. You literlaly just hatch them and then evolve them once they are ready, and that';s it. Then it gives you some text about the pet, but they aren't of any use that I can tell.\n\nAdventure has a little story to go along with it, and of course there are several others that card and puzzle games are known for. Very simple to start and it doesn't take more than a few seconds to understand the game. You unlock a couple other modes. Qucickplay, challenge, and some other mode that let's you go back and play any level you want.\n\nIt's nothing amazing, but if you want to jump into a game real quick when you don't ahve time and not worry about anything this is a good game for that. You can save and exit at any time and save your hand so no need to start over the entire chapter.\n\nThe game has achievements with 5 card drops.","December 6, 2013","true","3.5"," 57 of 71 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","57","71","0","1"

I saw a bunch of my Steam friends playing this and went ahead an bought it a while back, but didnt really crack into it until recently. It was a very pleasant surprise. It's solitaire with a few twists and a little story about a kid who finds faeries in captivity and frees them while seeking out the reason all of this is happening. Nothing too deep about the story, but it does hold your interest well enough, and is a nice fable on its own.\nThe gameplay itself is simple enough...it is not exactly solitaire, in that rather than match suits until you run out of cards, you are instead trying to build combos to take off the board using your held cards as the base card for said combos. The bigger the combo, the more it is worth. Additionally, you unlock powers such as being able to automatically link a card that would not normally combo, receive extra hold cards to use when you see fit, and build faerie structures that add benefits such as extra undo-s (which you can use to go back one move if you realize you made a mistake), the ability to look at the next card in your deck, and so on.\nEach round is made up of nine hands, and there were something like 27 rounds total, broken up into story chapters (each chapter is 3 rounds). Each round has a set of goals, which might include a certain card total combo being reached (8, 10, 12, even 15 in some rounds), acquire a certain amount of points, and fill your charge meter within a certain amount of time. You cant move forward until you meet all the goals, so you may end up repeating a round from time to time.\n\nAnyway, I found this to be a pleasant game with a reasonable amount of challenge, but still something you can do while distracted or feeling particularly unmotivated to do much of anything. I guess what I am saying is it is completely accessible to anybody, can be played in small snippets, and easily fills the gaming void when you aren't sure what else you want to play.\n\n9 out of 10","July 8, 2014","true","16.3"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

What do we have here? Our age old, classic card game that we practically grew up with since Windows 3.0 - or as your grandmother's generic hobby - combined with a pretty fairytale and collectibles? I'm in!\n\nThe scene opens up to the realm of fairies, threatened by an unspeakable conspiracy. A dark, evil force that we fail to identify enslaves the inhabitants of the realm for its own dark purposes. A kindly old wizard approaches, and declares us as the only possible candidate to save fairies from their torment... with our solitaire skills? (I owe this joke to my friend  Solanum Nigrum. It was originaly in his review, but I couldn't bear myself not to include it, due to the joke being perfectly definitive.) Yes, it is solitaire. Yes, it has a story... and the story actually ends with a huge cliffhanger, so you'll be anticipating for Faerie Solitaire 2 before you know.\n\nAside from your usual solitaire gameplay, Faerie Solitaire contains some surprises. You earn cash as you progress through various levels of the story - or in any casual game - to obtain upgrades for your gameplay. The gameplay also sets some goals for you in each level, that raises the stakes a bit more, either with time limits or a certain number of cards that you have to make a combo with. You are also entitled to collect some magical eggs that will hatch into various magical beasts. These beasties gain experience as you play and they may be raised into adulthood for their own achievement set.\n\nAll in all, it is a good game for a low price that you can pick to pass some mindless time, with interesting features. I also gotta mention that the art is surprisingly beautiful for a casual game. I adored the profile backgrounds and emoticons! I know, I know, it is girly... But I am a girl anyhow. So I am entitled to my fairies, damn it!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 8, 2015","true","22.8"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","28","34","0","2"

The way the basic game of solitaire is made fun by the way the arrangement of cards shifts and the rewards system that adds a little dimension to an otherwise monotonoous game.\n\nThe game was designed for an ancient monitor resolution of 800x600 and so is apt to look quite distorted on a modern widescreen monitor unless you play in windowed mode.  In that mode, the game window is small on a high resolution monitor and may cause some eye strain after long periods of playing.  So plan on short play periods when you are ready for a little casual fun and don't have time for a more serious game.\n\nThe developer promised in November 2012 that there would be a high resolution version released in the future and that all now current owners would get a free copy of the new version, which would have its own trading cards, etc.  So from a price point perspective, this game offers some trading cards now and potentially more in the future, which could be sold to further reduce the cost to the player.","December 8, 2013","true","32.1"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"

A nice game for casual players, just don't expect awesomeness. Oh, they promised to improve the game in a future update, just so you know.\n\nPros:\nVery addictive--you can play many rounds before getting tired\nBeautiful graphics\nNice BGM\nGetting money for the upgrades and materials for evolving pets add to its addictiveness\nThe Adventure mode is "faerly" long (sorry, couldn't resist the pun) and provides you with multiple layouts to play\nExtra 5-level Challenge mode adds (slightly) harder levels to the game, too\nAll special powers, extra cards and upgrades work well together\nCons:\nA bit too easy--I never lost a level (composed of 9 hands), even the challenges\nCollecting and evolving pets is insanely unbalanced--takes many, many hours and there's no guarantee you'll get all the pets. Not to mention they're useless.\nAfter I beat Adventure and Challenge modes, I wasn't really willing to keep playing (beat both in around 20 hours, which is a good run for a casual game)\nYou end up with a crazy amount of useless money, which could've been used, say, to buy pets you didn't find or evolve them\nThe voice actor for the main character is a ham (sorry, dude, just being honest)\nIt seems like they barely made any efforts to build a nice storyline--it doesn't make much sense, it's there just to give you a sense of progress\nYou can't change the 800x600 resolution (this will possibly be solved in a future patch, if I got it right)\nBought on / for: Steam Store for R$ 2,00 (US$ 0.85).

However I gave a point less for the tedious egg gathering which works in a really funky way. As you see above I have played about 68 hours in total, that's becuse of the totally random egg appearance combined with a bad way of generating them. And this game does not add enough fun and gameplay variations to play it for almost 70 hours (or more if you are unlucky with the egg generator) for most people. I would still recommend it as it is relaxing and fun for the most part.","October 4, 2014","true","68.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

If you see this game on sale and you like card style games even a little bit, it’s worth it to pick it up.\nThe gameplay is simple enough. You are dealt a board and you have to make chains from your foundation card. In order words, say your card is an eight. You can place a nine or seven from the board onto your foundation, and you can go up or down. As you remove cards from the board, other cards get revealed. It’s simple enough until they start throwing ice cards at you that have to be “unfrozen” with a fire card, or thorns that you have to untangle by uncovering all the cards on a rose. Then, as you remove cards from the board you might suddenly come across an egg. You can hatch your eggs for little pets. Do these pets do anything? Nope! But I have a baby unicorn!\nSo yeah, this game is highly addictive. Find the game too easy? Try the challenge mode and bang your head against the keyboard. Find the game too tough? Try quickplay or adventure mode. You can also spend in-game currency to unlock “talents” that help make the game easier like the ability to preview the next card in your deck, or the ability to know how many cards are remaining in your deck.\nSo, to wrap it up, I understand that ten dollars is a lot to spend on a solitaire game, but honestly It’s a great game and definitely worth it to pick it up on sale. The only thing that might turn people off is the “fairy” package the surrounds the play style. Yes, it’s a bit feminine but honestly it’s not going to stop your enjoyment in any way.

Perfect for a bit of quiet time before bed, when you want to be occupied but not over-stimulated.\n\nSolid 4/5, if you're a fan of Solitaire games.","September 28, 2014","true","62.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","1"

Faerie Solitaire is the game that everyone has played at some point in their life plus a story, rpg elements such as exp and upgrades, and some pleasant background noise.\n\n.Game play.\nYour objective is to count. You have a deck of cards from which you draw one card and then you try and place it on a card on the game board before you that either precedes it or follows it--i.e, if you have a 6, you can place it on a 5 or 7. It's very simple and very satisfying if you can get a good count running. Some boards have a gimick such as ice that can be removed if you clear the cards in front of a 'fireball' spell and thorns that can be removed if you clear the row of cards over their roots.\n\nBesides that, you sometimes find eggs if you clear the rows of cards on the board and you can equip the pets inside of them so that they passively gain experience while you play. The pets evolve using ingredients you can find the same way you find their eggs, but their only function is for vanity (and achievements).\n\n.Story/Premise.\nYou're trying to save the Faerie Land and you progress through each area by playing solitaire. It doesn't make much sense, but... Magic!\n\n.Art style/graphics.\nIt's colourful and cartoony. The illustrations on the cards and for the pets are cute and the animations for the spells you cast or the combo meter are neat.\n\n.Soundtrack.\nIt's peaceful. Suitable for a card game.\n\n.Bottom line.\nThere's not much else to say. Faerie Solitaire is a nice way to pass the time.

The adventure mode presents you with objectives that you need to achieve in order to progress (all related to your solitaire games).\n\nIn order to keep you interested, there are also collectable eggs dropped randomly (as far as I can tell) while you play, that you can hatch and evolve into creatures.

All this stretched over an 12 hour long campaign of nothing but new backgrounds and a couple of uneventful cutscenes that try to tell a story but fall short in every respect.\n\nEach level also has some objectives you have to meet, and if you don't then you simply have to retry the level from the beginning, over and over till you meet the objectives. There is also a challenge set, with 5 levels with different backgrounds and objectives that are in line with the Intermediate difficulty level.\n\nAlso, there are an excessive amounts of fairies (faeries, because it looks better) that don't serve any purpose to the over all game. Oh yes, and there are pets which don't do anything either, except add some sort of "replay" value to the game.\n\nSteam Cloud support is needed here, but not included. There are 30 Steam achievements which are intertwined within the games user interface quite nicely, but I shouldn't really mention the achievements, because they are part of Faerie Solitaire's main flaw (read: bug that the developers aren't interested in fixing). Two of the achievements are related to the (unnecessary/useless) pets feature within the game, which is completely random and unlikely to work as intended. So expect an extra 20 hours of grindy gameplay on top of the already boring campaign if you want all 30 achievements.\n\nTime to complete is around 12 hours, 35 hours if you want all the achievements. However, the more unlucky players could be made to sit around for 100+ hours because of the pet bug.\n\nFaerie Solitaire is not a good game.","October 3, 2013","false","34.7"," 30 of 55 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","30","55","0","6"

Some are really easy and others take a lot of planning and saving of spare cards to get (20 card combo? Have fun saving up a bunch of cards for that one!)\n\nAdding in a pet system is useful too. Play card games until you get enough to hatch and evolve them. Their abilities are very helpful in completing the game.\n\nI found it nice that this game doesn't force you to keep replaying a round over and over and trying to use every card possible. It's just more of "you did the best you could and that's what counts" and moves you on. You never have a time you won't get all the EXP needed to complete a chapter.\n\nThe story seems kind of bland to me sadly. It's fairies and I like faires as much as princesses and the such but the story just seems to kind of draw on to me and given how many chapters there are, you're going to be sitting here for a long time completing the game, not to mention trying to save up to buy all the stuff in the villiage that will help you complete the game quicker and help save your bacon on an occassion or two.\n\nIf you enjoy card games with fantasy and stories weaved into them, you'll most likely enjoy this one. Bought this game for $0.99 with a coupon so if you can, would recommend trying to get a coupon for this game then buying it. Achievments, steam cards, and all, this game is alright and fun.","July 7, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Also just a great game of solitaire.\n\nCons: If you're someone who needs to get a hundred percent, this game becomes a time-sink as you play levels over and over to search for the last few eggs to hatch and mature. To date, I've dropped 193 hours on the game and am still missing the last three or so eggs. Also after you buy all the enhancements, there's nothing left to do with the money so it just piles up uselessly.  Not a whole lot of replay value, at least not in terms of going back to the very beginning. Once the story is over it's pretty much over.\n\nSummary: A great game if you just want to play unique hands of solitaire. Interesting mechanics and visuals.

It's not a hardcore game, it's meant for casual play.  That said, it does what it does well.  If you're going to play a card game on the computer, this should probably be it.  The audio is good, the animations are solid and enjoyable, and the gameplay mechanics are well polished and fun.  There are unlocks and pet evolving - everything a casual game should have to keep you hooked and make you want to keep playing.  There is also a MASSIVE singleplayer campaign of solitaire.  I beat the entire thing before reviewing this game and it took me a solid 7-9 hours.  That's right folks, 7-9 hours of straight solitaire - and I loved it.  The game functions well, does what it sets out to do in a great way, and doesn't try to overextend its reach.\n\nIf you're looking for a card game or a gift for a person who plays Windows' solitaire regularly this is the game to buy.  Don't buy it thinking it's something besides a time killer or a casual game.\n\nPros:\n\nGood audio\nSolid mechanics\nHuge singleplayer campaign\nUnlocks\nComboing is fun and addictive\n\nCons:\n\nIt's just a card game\nWhen you complete one objective towards beating a level it shouldn't display that objective any more on subsequent hands - you'll know what I'm talking about if you play the game\n\nAs I said, it's a card game; nothing more, nothing less.  However, if you're looking for that, it's a great game.  It does take the main solitaire game and spin it a little bit creatively, but nothing too much to write home about.  One minor thing I would have changed is the way the audio works - when you go up the audio goes up, when you go down, the audio should go down.  But that's neither here nor there.  I rate this game average as it doesn't do much new, but if you want to play a card game I highly recommend Faerie Solitaire - B","February 2, 2013","true","15.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/7grain/recommended/38600/","7grain","7grain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/7grain/","291 products in account","The kindest thing I can say about Faerie Solitaire is that it's designed to let you bite off very small servings. From the time when you start the game, you can be playing a hand in about 15 seconds, and each hand takes just 90-120 seconds to complete. So if you need to kill 5 minutes but don't feel like waiting a full minute or two to fire up a larger game, this is a fine time waster, right here.\n\nHaving said that, it's not a particularly good solitaire game. It's basically TriPeaks with some variation to the layouts. It adds in grind features to compel you to continue playing, but these features aren't very well designed. Some of these features, in fact, add strategic elements to the game that actually make it less enjoyable, for me.\n\nI'm prying myself away after about 4 hours. Friends who have finished it tell me it takes 12-15 hours. Can't do it.","April 3, 2012","true","18.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

You can play this for a long time due to its simple and addictive nature.\n\nIn adventure mode, you collect money and materials to use for upgrades. As if solitaire wasn't addictive already, the great minds at Subsoap decided to add RPG elements to it and pets, yes, I said pets!\n\nThe fun gameplay and objective list keeps you playing as you go through each level. Most card games don't have a sense of progression, while this does.\n\nI like when games do something different and I especially love how well the developers crafted this experience with a little bit of magic and a sense of adventure.\n\nGreat casual fun to unwind with.","May 16, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We were both surprised to find the game was pretty fun.\n\nIt's a fairly simple card card game where you attempt to take cards from a layout and place them on your deck. You can only place cards that immediately precede or follow the face up card on the top of your deck. There are a number of bonuses and goals, plus a narrated story between hands, that keep the game lively and interesting.\n\nOne drawback is the game's fixed resolution. Every time I play, I have to adjust my monitor's aspect ratio to make the game's screen large enough to see properly. If it weren't for that, I'd probably play it more often. As it is, I've put in about 11 hours on it and it's only now starting to wear a little thin.\n\nIt's a fun time-waster that'd be worth maybe $5.","February 19, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shpladoink/recommended/38600/","shpladoink","Turd Ferguson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shpladoink/","390 products in account","Spoilers:\nFaerie solitaire is about a dude that goes into the woods chasing faeries, then sets the forest on fire by luring fire faeries into the trees. He feels so bad about this that he cries and breaks his wizard staff. Our hero then goes to a faerie fortress and kills a bunch of faerie guards. This makes him cry also.

However, this game got some great additions that makes it better than just Solitaire. For example, there is an adventure mode where you go through a lot of levels of story telling. There are also challenges and a quick play mode.\n\nBut this definitely isn't the Solitaire you would expect. You can purchase upgrades in the Faerie land which makes the game far more easier for you. Then there's the ability to evolve pets. Whenever you complete a row of cards, there is a possibility an egg will be behind it, which you can breed and evolve. Though the game did tell me that these could also work in your advantage, I haven't seen too many changes because of them yet.\n\nThis game does have flaws though, being that the story is completely ignorable and the ending is even more terrible. Evolving your pets also take way too long and so does the adventure mode. I also didn't care for the music, which I just put off and played my own music.\n\nAs a final verdict, this is more of a casual game that you pick up whenever you have nothing better to do. Do only purchase the game when it is on sale or really cheap, otherwise it is not worth it. It is a pretty fun and addicting game, but it stays with that.","March 23, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The instructions take care to note that the suit of the cards don't matter, so why did the designers bother giving the cards suits at all? They already gave them custom images based on the pets, so they could've elminated card suit all together and streamlined the instructions. As it stands the suits only serve as a distraction.\n\nThat aside, I do enjoy this game. It's fun to figure out the best sequence of cards, and the longer the chain you're able to string the more satisfying it feels to end the combo. I thought the ending was far too abrupt, but considering that the story is thin and non-essential in the first place I suppose I shouldn't complain... BUT I'm going to anyway: The crying fairies got old fast. I'd like to see them... y'know, do something. They're magical flying glowy things; I have to imagine they're capable of more than crying at the protagonist.\n\nBut, I digress. The game's fun enough, although maybe not $10's worth of fun. If you catch it when it's at least half off, I do recommend giving it a go.

This game is good for some relaxing during an afternoon; even though it's simple, there's still some challenge to it. The aesthethic is really nice, featuring some nice backgrounds for each of the different levels, all following a fantasy theme.\n\nThe game offers several modes; an adventure mode, in which you play through 40 levels, following the story of a kid who encountered faeries, and all the dangers he encountered during his journey to save them which, although might sound unnecessary for a solitaire game, adds a nice backstory. There's also a quickplay mode, in which you can replay any previously finished level, and a challenge mode, with some more difficult levels. Each level consists of 9 hands, and, while it's not necessary to collect all cards in each hand, there's still different objectives to complete in order to beat a level.\n\nThe game also includes a "Faerie Land"; think of it as an upgrade/collectibles shop, where you can get several different upgrades spending money you earn during the game, and also a hatchery for all the different pets you may encounter while you play. It is a nice addition to the game, giving it a bit more of depth.\n\nAs far as soundtracks go, it consists of several relaxing songs that play during each level, providing a calm environment while you play.\n\nAll things said, I think this is a recommendable solitaire game, for when you want some casual, relaxing fun.","February 29","true","56.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was surprisingly impressed.\n\nFaerie Solitaire is surprisingly solid and engaging, easy to play and still satisfying with crisp sounds and a nice style. Gameplay is random but still functional at the start, with new mechanics added gradually to alleviate the problems of random card draws. In a few hours, you can 100% any level by pure skill and planning. The progression system is solid, although collecting all the eggs is too random. The only bug that stands out is the first card not counting for Aura Ring if unused. It can be worked around by drawing the next card and using Undo, but it's something that should've been noted and fixed.\n\nIt is basically a free game that would be played online or on mobile, but it is polished and engaging enough to be worthwhile. I probably have 30 hours that haven't shown up due to playing offline. Offline play is one strength I would also consider; achievements unlocked offline will pop on Steam when you check the in-game achievements while online. Keeping this in mind, you can save the last Faerie Land purchase or Challenge stage to complete online, hitting all the offline achievements without backtracking.\n\nThere is a fair amount to enjoy in this game, but it will get old after some time. But 40 hours of enjoyable gameplay is worth a purchase for those interested. I'd recommend the game at 75% off or better for most players.","August 27, 2014","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The main game isn't hard but there are harder objectives to achieve once you're done with the story part (and those can be hard). Only thing I found underdeveloped was pets. You collect eggs, hatch them, and fill up an energy bar to make them evolve. There's some lore for each pet but that's about it.

I didn't really expect to put 17 hours into it. I enjoyed playing this game quite a bit and go back to it from time to time. It's a solitaire game, so it's nothing mind-blowing, but it does have a few interesting features to mix things up. There are obstacles you need to clear to access some cards. It might not sound like much, but I felt it kept things interesting over playing standard solitaire. You can unlock a few power ups along the way also, which evolve the gameplay as you progress. Again, nothing drastic, but they do impact the way you play just enough. This is a casual game, so it won't provide any particularly strong challenge.\n\nThere are little objectives for each level and 30 reasonably obtainable Steam achievements, though the pet collecting ones will take a bit of time. Achievements are really the only reason to raise pets. There's really not much story to it. I can't even recall the story at the time of this writing.\n\nNot much more to say about this.

As solitaire is her favourite game to play while watching her TV programs... O what little did I know the horrible gut wrenching grind fest this game would turn into. If you' like achievements like myself 28/30 achievements are "Faerie" ;) easy to obtain! How ever if you're a perfectionist also like myself that last egg... Saying that it is "tough" to get would be the understatement of the year. With one of the Faerie Solitaire guide creators loosely calculating the eggs drop rate at 0.0017% and myself logging over 300 hours now I can see no light at the end of this tunnel. Many of us have pleaded with the developers in the forums to remedy this situation. But all efforts are met with vain. As if going into the code & changing a few numbers in the drop rate is impossible or something...\n\n","January 5","false","330.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","9","17","4","0"

Interestingly, they introduce the concept of having pets that evolve as you play through the levels. Unfortunately, those pets don't do anything (that I could tell), and so are ultimately pointless. If they gave some kind of bonuses based on pet type, there would be a much better strategy component to it.\n\nAll-in-all, the game is a solid, fun card game, but the adventure is extremely long with very little variation.

I got this game for $1 and had a lot of fun with it, but the ending and the egg drop rate left me not with warm fuzzy feelings but feelings leaning more toward annoyance and anger.  Part 2 has become a huge project with 15 parts and last I checked part 4 wasn't even done.  A remastered version of the original is in the works to fix the egg drop problem, but it means starting the game over.\n\nLong of it: I enjoy solitaire games anyway, but thought the fairy theme was really fun.  I was enjoying the story and the sense that something wasn't quite right and I really wanted to know what happened next.  I felt like I was finding pets on pace to maybe unlock them all by the time I finished story mode.  I really liked that the pets had baby and adult forms, but I felt like the evolving process was too slow.  Then I got to the end of the game and after my initial shock upon realizing that really was the ending, I told myself surely they must have released the second part by now since this game is over three years old.  After some research, I discover that not only have they not released part two, they have turned it into this huge project of 15 parts and they haven't even completed part 4.  However, the really frustrating thing is trying to get the last two pet eggs.  After you clear all the cards in a stack there is a chance that a material will drop (used to evolve your pets), nothing will drop, or an egg will drop.  Then IF it is an egg drop, it is a random drop of an egg from any level and if you already have all the eggs in that level you get no drop.  I'm not big on the math but that means your odds of dropping that last egg or two are ridiculously low.  Check out the forums and read the many frustrated posts of people who have spent 100+ hours on this game and still have not found the last eggs.  The developers have responded and said that instead of patching the game, they will be releasing a remastered version that addresses this issue and removes the randomness from the drops after so long.  However, that was announced in 2012 and whenever it is released it means starting over.\nI've put 16 hours into this game and I still have 9 pets to evolve and 2 to find. Like I said, I really enjoyed the story and I like the idea of the pets, but I find the replayability of this game to be really low - aside from the forced replayability of trying to find the last two pet eggs and evolve the pets.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game if you can find it for $1 like I did, if not unlocking all the achievements is ok with you, and if you go in eyes wide open that the ending is a cliffhanger.\n\nEdit - Since writing this review, the developer has decided to release a game called FaeVerse Alchemy which is in early access (still in development).  I have no idea why they would choose to push this in front of Faerie Solitaire 2 (which they agree is overdue).  I understand them pushing it in front of the remaster of the original Faerie Solitaire because they have promised the remastered version as a free update.  Still it's lame.","March 22, 2014","true","16.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

As someone who's never dabbled much into solitaire, I figured I would spend an hour looking at this and chuckle at the whole thing. Weirdly, even though the story is a wonderful schlockfest of campy tropes and no connection to the actual gameplay or goals whatsoever, I couldn't stop playing.\n\nSolitaire is a simple and admittedly boring game, one that is meant to pass time when there is nothing else to do and no one to play with. With only the lightest added perks such as monster collecting, light goals to reach, interesting card set ups and the removal of having to match specific suits, FS turns the whole trite affair into an exciting and wildly engaging affair that I couldn't put down for the next 3 days. I found it best served with some podcasts in the background so as not to feel like I was wasting my life away, but there is an amazing amount of content her from such a simple concept.\n\nAfter it got its hooks in me, every hand I practically twitched when I didn't clear the boardfor fear of missing out on a new monster egg for my collection that might've been hidden behind those last two cards. The impressive difficulty curve the game presents is also kind of amazing, which is not something I was expecting at all. Fascinatingly complex set ups can lead to a surprising amount of forethought and tactical card plays that can make or break a run. Of course, like all games that surround the old 52, there is no garuntee you'll be able to clear the board, but Faerie offers a variety of unlockable tools that make the prospect more and more plausible. One tool in particular can save a hand for total defeat, in which if you can't make a move in 5 turns, you can zap a card and make it your base. It adds an extra layer to an already complex layer of moves, and once I got into the grove I could rip through hands at unbelievable speed. It's hard to describe just how rewarding this game can be without playing it yourself.\n\nOf course, there are flaws. Plenty of them. The art used to differentiate the cards are not very appealing, the soundtrack can become grating, and the voice-acted story is cheesy and oh so teeth-grindingly bad. Somehow, though, this doesn't detract, but somehow amplifies the glory of this weird little game. While I wasn't neccessarily chomping at the bit to hear the next chapter in the riveting saga, there is a genuine aloof passion to the whole story that I can't help but admire. There is tons of great art in the game that just didn't seem to get used on the cards, but they do help stimulate recognition, to the point where I stopped paying attention to the numbers all together. This is not to say the art is bad; quite the contrary, but that goblin they put on the king cards really begged for a punch in the face. Of course for the soundtrack, you can always turn the music off and put something more to your taste on.\n\nNot exactly a game I expected to like, and definitely not a game I'd come to love. Faerie Solitaire is the sort of guilty pleasure I never thought I wanted. I can't recomend this lovely pile of cheese enough.","August 29, 2015","true","20.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

As someone who's never dabbled much into solitaire, I figured I would spend an hour looking at this and chuckle at the whole thing. Weirdly, even though the story is a wonderful schlockfest of campy tropes and no connection to the actual gameplay or goals whatsoever, I couldn't stop playing.\n\nSolitaire is a simple and admittedly boring game, one that is meant to pass time when there is nothing else to do and no one to play with. With only the lightest added perks such as monster collecting, light goals to reach, interesting card set ups and the removal of having to match specific suits, FS turns the whole trite affair into an exciting and wildly engaging affair that I couldn't put down for the next 3 days. I found it best served with some podcasts in the background so as not to feel like I was wasting my life away, but there is an amazing amount of content her from such a simple concept.\n\nAfter it got its hooks in me, every hand I practically twitched when I didn't clear the boardfor fear of missing out on a new monster egg for my collection that might've been hidden behind those last two cards. The impressive difficulty curve the game presents is also kind of amazing, which is not something I was expecting at all. Fascinatingly complex set ups can lead to a surprising amount of forethought and tactical card plays that can make or break a run. Of course, like all games that surround the old 52, there is no garuntee you'll be able to clear the board, but Faerie offers a variety of unlockable tools that make the prospect more and more plausible. One tool in particular can save a hand for total defeat, in which if you can't make a move in 5 turns, you can zap a card and make it your base. It adds an extra layer to an already complex layer of moves, and once I got into the grove I could rip through hands at unbelievable speed. It's hard to describe just how rewarding this game can be without playing it yourself.\n\nOf course, there are flaws. Plenty of them. The art used to differentiate the cards are not very appealing, the soundtrack can become grating, and the voice-acted story is cheesy and oh so teeth-grindingly bad. Somehow, though, this doesn't detract, but somehow amplifies the glory of this weird little game. While I wasn't neccessarily chomping at the bit to hear the next chapter in the riveting saga, there is a genuine aloof passion to the whole story that I can't help but admire. There is tons of great art in the game that just didn't seem to get used on the cards, but they do help stimulate recognition, to the point where I stopped paying attention to the numbers all together. This is not to say the art is bad; quite the contrary, but that goblin they put on the king cards really begged for a punch in the face. Of course for the soundtrack, you can always turn the music off and put something more to your taste on.\n\nNot exactly a game I expected to like, and definitely not a game I'd come to love. Faerie Solitaire is the sort of guilty pleasure I never thought I wanted. I can't recomend this lovely pile of cheese enough.","August 29, 2015","true","20.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Overall, I can't say that the story did anything for me, but the puzzles were interesting (if tricky and overly luck-based).\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter / 100%'er, avoid this game. A couple of them are completely luck-based and you'll find yourself grinding long past the point where the gameplay's grown stale to knock off the last few.\n\nStill, all in all, I find myself slightly in favour of a "yes" recommendation, but would not recommend paying the full price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TIZexion/recommended/38600/","TIZexion","[T.I.] Zexion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TIZexion/","159 products in account","A rather simple card game to pass the time, Faerie Solitaire is literally as the name implies--a slightly glittered-up version of solitaire. It is something to play should you want to just aimlessly pass the time away. If you have any other games on your list to play, then I suggest playing them first. Don't get me wrong, the game is decent in its own right, but mainly for younger ages, casual gamers, grandparents, or those odd people who actually classify themselves as "gamers" because they play facebook games. It has a few unique factors to it such as pets, achievements, and objectives, which utterly make it seem more and more like it truly does belong on facebook.\n\nObjectives start out easy and gradually increase with difficulty as you progress through the short and thin plot of the game. If you do not complete an objective on that level then you must start it over completely. This is something that will utterly allow you to waste more time should you so wish. Achievements vary but are relatively simple to grasp and accomplish by just playing the game. Lastly, you can find eggs and other "mystical" items as you progress, and they allow you to hatch them and raise your own pets/creatures over time. There are baby and adult versions of each creature--it evolves when you acquire the appropriate materials and earn enough exp (which you attain by simply putting time into the game I believe). The point of the game is to fill "Faerie Land" with creatures and release trapped Faeries by playing the card games somehow... Overall, I recommend Faerie Solitaire only if you are truly bored or have a younger sibling/child you wish to entertain while babysitting them.","January 27, 2015","false","4.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","40","4","10","4","0"

They make it easier, at least in the early levels, but it's still by and large luck, and you'll occasionally get a board start with all the 4s in a row on the bottom, and all the 3s and 5s behind them so that it's flat impossible to play that hand.  Want to reset so you get a hand you can play? Too bad, you have to do a set of 9 hands in a levle, and resetting means losing all your cash and items and starting back from the beginning of the hand, meaning you wasted the last 8 minutes you were playing.  Like real solitaire, it's luck-based, but real solitaire just shrugs and lets you play again.  In Fairie Solitaire, it lets you know you're a failure for something beyond your control... other than just not playing the game.\n\nOf course, even if you are a perfectionist, there's very little reason to want to go back.  There's an award for beating a hand in less than a minute, but a more reasonable pace is about 2 minutes a hand, and there are 9 hands a level, 5 levels a stage, and 8 stages... That is, 6 hours if you never have to repeat things... and you WILL have to repeat things.\n\nHands and levels are little different from one another.  They do have things like a "thorn patch", which is a line of cards that only opens up when you clear some other line of cards, or an "ice wall", which is a line of cards that only opens up... when you clear some other line of cards.  Basically, it's the same tricks over and over, but with a different icon for it. Get ready to grind, because they couldn't think of anything more to add to solitaire.  (Note that even the positive reviews here say that this game is EXTREMELY repetitive.)  Note that levels basically repeat the same placement patterns and hoops to jump through, just the exact order of cards is different, so expect repeating levels to get VERY old VERY fast.  In a supposedly 6 hour game, some of these people have 20 hours or more...\n\nThere's voice acting, but it's tied to the music volume for reasons I can't comprehend, and the music is far, FAR louder than the voice, so you have to crank it down to a whisper so the music doesn't deafen you.\n\nThere's a "pet system" but it's really just randomly getting things about 0.01% of the time when you clear a line, and then getting told you are "leveling up" this thing by just doing what you were doing, anyway.  Pets do nothing.  At all.  You can't even see them in the corner of the screen as you play.  They just require you select them to have them invisibly gain XP to invisibly grow up (after you give them resources that are also random drops) so that you check another box off on the way to completion.  Plus, there's a ton of them there, since, of course, if you're going to tack these things on just to extend gameplay, you might as well make them drop rarely, have a ton of them, no player control over what you get, and put out an achievement for it if you Gotta Catch 'Em All.\n\nIt's also bizzarely unoptimized, lagging on my computer and using up all the CPU it can get in spite of it being a rock-simple sprite-based game.\n\nAlso, if you look at the art and think you might want to play it just because you like fairies or something, keep in mind that they basically don't appear much.  Even the pets are things like robots instead of fairies, at least the ones I got, and most of the time, the fairies are just yellow glowy bits in a jar you get to release for nothing more than a "Thank you :D" at the end of a level.  99% of the game has no fairy onscreen, just cards.  They only appear in a few still images, all of which appear in the screenshot gallery, or between stages.\n\nAll told, it looks feels, and plays like the sort of game marketed to older women who don't play anything but casual games, and the amount of quality and effort that went into the game reflects the sort of mentality of someone with only enough skill or dedication to pull off something just barely excusible to ship to a less discriminating customer base if you just have a fairy theme in it.\n\nI got it for $0.50 on a 95% off sale, which says a lot about the game, and I sold the cards for nearly enough to pay for itself, but it still wasn't all that great an experience...  Definitely only buy on sale when you have enough in your Steam Wallet to not even notice the money spent, if at all...","January 8, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It's pure escapism, a low-calorie nutritionless fluff for the reptilian parts of the brain to feast upon. Faerie Solitaire takes this base and adds a variety of new hooks to keep you going, such as adorable pets to raise, a village to upgrade with hard-earned fae bucks, and a whole lot of imprisoned faeries for your generic male hero to rescue. On top of that, the pace is strangely merciless; you jump from one stage to the next without getting a chance to spend your new gold and resources on upgrades. To do so requires shamefully quitting mid-hand, and to actually quit the game itself requires a few more steps of legwork and runs you past the Challenge Mode gift shop before letting you out.\n\nThe gameplay itself is perhaps a few degrees less brainless than that of actual Solitaire, but it's still a game that mostly plays itself and is almost entirely at the mercy of the way the deck was initially dealt. On the easiest difficulty setting, this doesn't matter; it would take phenomenally bad luck not to meet the meager victory requirements for each stage. On the most difficult, you're more likely to get struck by lightning than to win without grinding endlessly for the consumable items that break the game entirely. Regardless of difficulty, the gameplay is the same, a repetitive series of clicks that gives you just enough of a reward feed to make you feel accomplished. Don't bother with this one; the spell breaks early and if you really need an endlessly addictive time-sink, there are much better perfectly free ones.","February 7, 2014","false","2.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

So naturally I just skipped everything, assuming the game to be simple enouhg to just pick up as you play. I was correct in this assumption and I completed the game in 8 hours (not 14 hours like the description claims) having never read any of the "insturctions".\n\nI feel the developers didn't really try to make a PC game, it must be a port from andriod or iOS, esepcially as the resolution was some ungodly ratio from probably a decade ago. I can't comment on the music/sounds as I muted them as soon as I could. The art is the bare minimum, the backgrounds for each hands in mostly a single colour background with a small banner at the top of the screen. The story I also didn't care about and didn't read any of the test, so I can't really comment on that either.\n\nAll I'm glad about is that I got this game "free" with a bundle, and I hadn't wasted any amount of money on it. I'd actually be quite interested to see data on how many people actually bought this game...\n\n1/10","February 15, 2014","false","8.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

In other words, this game intentionally lowers your testosterone level, which may be good, if you're having some health issues, but it is quite boring in the most cases. Well, even if you DO need to lower testosterone level or don't care for that matter at all... sadly, but besides of being an easy game about saving fairies, that thing doesn't bring any noticeable amounts of pleasure or complacency I usually expect.\n\nI must say there: I'm speaking about one particular game! I've spent hundreds of hours in games like "Plants vs. Zombies", "World of Goo", "Zuma", or my favourite there on Steam - "Shufflepuck Cantina"... Really, there are many non-violent casual games which I prefer over shooters like Crysis... only thing I care is it fun and satisfying or not.\n\nI've played hundreds of thousands solitaire games, while idling... you know, when you listening to some podcast, awaiting in some queue, or something like that - the windows basic set of games is always a relief, if you don't have a book or something greater to do. The basic solitaire game doesn't need too much attention - you can play it, while there are something else is going, and it can be a moving meditation of sort... but it is not about Faerie Solitaire. There are too many insignificant details, that always keep you a bit distracted by themselves. So to play that game you actually need full observation. And there are way too little to do in there with the full attention. A paradox. Relatively speaking, you can't play it with one eye, and it is not worth to stare at with both eyes.\n\nTo finish talking about that game, there is one of those hatred luck-based achievements, which you can try to unlock by ages.\n\nIn sum, it is a small casual game, which you can gift to some non-gaming girl. Or your mother, maybe... However, to play in it by yourself, even if you're a girl, yet from our gaming breed... Now that's an low move.  5/10 mark.","September 18, 2015","false","19.1"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","2"

The only thing the developers say is customers will have to wait til the next version of the game. They even say this next game will be free for customers of this game, but they keep saying so for years now. What does that tell you? I leave the answer to you.\n\nTHIS was my original review:\n\nI think this game is worth it's price but I must admit that I bought it in a humble weekly sale with a few other games beside it.\n\nFor 8,99 I think it's overpriced as you can get games of similar type featuring better graphics.\n\nOne annoying thing about this is that it keeps quitting during gameplay every now and then but as it's a typical casual game it doesn't annoy me very much.\n\nThe game itself is very easy and you should avoid it if you're in for a real solitaire game as this has barely to do with normal solitaire rules at all.\n\nOn the good side there are many achievements to discover in form of eggs you find behind solved stacks of cards. These eggs can be hatched and evolved. Sadly as it is this seems to have no influence at all to the gameplay and can be seen as a filler ...\n\nNonetheless I recommend you to buy this game in a discount. It's great fun for what it is: a typical casual game.\n\nThe ambient music suits it very well by the way.\n\nThis game is a true chiller.","December 26, 2013","false","119.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Luckily you can skip any of this story to get back to the cards.  There is some artwork in the background that may be related to the story, but just seems pretty arbitrary.  You can buy powerups to help you out a bit, but the game like most card games needs luck more than skill.\n\nThere is also a Pokemon type collect eggs and resources side game which is a silly distraction.  You get to "evolve" your pets by just playing the cards more.\n\nThe worst thing about this game as you will read in the guides is the last egg(s) have stupidly low drop rates.  I ended up with 2.3million unused cash I couldn't do anything with.  I had a pile of useless resources and just playing the game trying to get an egg to spawn.  I can see why people set up a program to auto click this game while they are AFK.  Its JUST broken and really annoying.  Any goodwill I felt to the game was lost trying to get the last egg.  I do realise I could have just stopped playing and moved on, but I wanted 100% achievements.  I also wanted to EARN it vs some auto click cheating.\nFor me I went through the campaign 3 times.\n\nI'd suggest you just stick to the solitaire games in Windows unless you are nuts about fairys.","November 26, 2013","false","61.6"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","1"

"faerie solitaire". i had to make myself appear offline to my friends every time i wanted to play this game just so i didnt have to explain to them why the ♥♥♥♥ i was playing "faerie solitaire". apparently there's some story about saving fairies through the power of solitaire or some ♥♥♥♥. i dont know. there was a cutscene that played in the beginning that was pretty gay so i skipped all cutscenes from then on. maybe there is some deep faerie solitaire lore that i am missing out on but ♥♥♥♥ it.\n\nthe real problem with this game is that all the achievements are ♥♥♥♥ing easy to get besides 2 which are to hatch all pets or some ♥♥♥♥. so naturally im like "i gotta get all these achievements my ♥♥♥♥♥" but the RNG that determines if the egg that you need will drop is ♥♥♥♥in ridiculous! you'd have to be a ♥♥♥♥in maniac to play long enough to get those rare drops. so i did what any reasonable person would do and got that ♥♥♥♥. i will not disclose how but let's just say MY ♥♥♥ wasnt actually sitting there playing for 67.1 hrs.\n\nnow here is why i am not gonna recommend the game. "faerie solitaire". everyone i know would look at me like im an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if i said with a straight face "seriously you gotta buy faerie solitaire bro". it's like they didnt even know that people who use steam are also usually sweaty 15-30 year old dudes (usually). it doesn't help that me and every other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who just has to get all the achievements get shrekt by RNG until faerie solitaire becomes one of our top played games. the forums for this game are literally filled with dudes crying over the fact that they've played like 200+ hours and they still didnt get their damn dragon egg. this is what faerie solitaire turns you into. i've been there.\n\nother than that the games pretty fun.","October 28, 2014","false","67.1"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

There's upgrades to buy, and many pets to collect and grow. Collecting all the pets can be a chore though, since the eggs they hatch from are randomly spawned from game to game, so sometimes you can go dozens of games without seeing an egg. Well, towards the end of the pet collecting anyway. At the beginning you get them at a decent rate, but around the halfway mark it starts to slow down. Also, it takes 'time' to hatch and then mature. Each card you click will tick down it's 'hatching' and/or 'growing timer, so it can take a while.\n\nHowever, the pet feature is completely optional. This is the kinda game people buy when they either want a coffee break game, or they're a huge fan of solitaire games. Either way, you'll be playing this game a lot normally and the pet feature is a nice thing to do on the side, which for long term players is the only thing left on the side.\n\nThere's an upgrade system which will make playing more convieniet, however it doesn't take too long to max those out and afterwards the only thing left is the pet feature and solitaire... which is great too.\n\nOverall, this is just a great game and the devs are great people. Back when this game was first released, the devs were generous enough to host many giveaways in various communities, giving away quite a few copies, which is how I got mine.\n\nAs for the current price point, I feel $10 is a good price considering that this game has given me more hours than an uncomfortable number of AAA.","June 17, 2014","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Regular solitaire can be fairly monotonous, so the challenges set in this game bring some variety. I played the adventure mode through and it really is nicer to play in quickplay or challenges as you don't need to listen to the story anymore. Also, the pets aren't any use, except for getting 100% achievements, if you're a completionist.\n\nI play the game in normal mode, which sometimes feels a bit too easy. There are also Master and Impossible modes for those who want to up the difficulty. I tried the Master mode on the first levels of the game and it was a bit too hard for me as I play solitaire when I'm too tired or stressed to play something that requires a lot of thinking.\n\nMaybe I should also mention that I got the game from Steam sale and only paid 0.49€.

I spent about an hour and a half playing on the Master difficulty. Master difficulty is really, really hard - but absolutely doable - if you're a new player, because the game expects you to have already played the game all the way through once. This is because the game works on a level and item progression, and it expects you to have a lot of pets and things made properly powerful before it lets you move onto the next level. Otherwise, this is definitely casual fare and very easy when played properly. However, if you're looking for a Nintendo Hard challenge, buy this game and play it right off the bat on Master. It makes the BIT.TRIP games look easy in comparison.

The game is basically a variant on Solitaire where you have one deck you draw from to grab cards from the playing field to clear the playing field. The playing field has differing sized stacks that may sometimes overlap, as well as quirky 'seals' where a stack is locked until a requirement is met (clearing a specific card or clearing a specific stack).\n\nThere are stages, which are broken down into levels, and each level has 9 hands. Each level has a number of objectives that must be completed by the last hand or you fail and must restart the level. It's a pretty simple game and has a friendly atmosphere that is very kid friendly.\n\nI have one complaint about the game though, and as anyone looking through the forums will see it is the same gripe as everyone else; pet eggs and hatching. It is completely luck and time based to acquire the final two achievements, and many people have spent countless hours grinding these out. And it is not as if the pets actually do anything or serve any purpose other than lore and cuteness. The pets are completely pointless and are a huge time sink. I am VERY lucky to have gotten all but one egg (at the time of writing this) in 27 hours of gameplay (idle time spent in my shop when I have nothing to do while watching episodes of Futurama).\n\nBUT aside from that, the game is solid, visually appealing, has a story (which I skipped entirely so no idea how good it is), and the music is pleasing (up until the 20th hour or so). Do I recommend? Maybe. But because I have only two options, I will say 'Yes'.","July 8, 2014","true","43.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have all achievements except the challenges and the pets, and they weren't all that challenging to get.   I'll likely play a few more hands simply to complete the challenges, but the game just doesn't have enough to it to make a person want to play thru it another few times to unlock and evolve all the pets - it's simply too much of a grind.","July 15, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know I didn't pay $10 for it; in fact, I'm pretty sure I got it for free. In any case, It's fairly entertaining.\n\nIt's easy to learn how to play Faerie Solitaire, which makes this game great for kids. I could see parents using this game to teach young children the basics of solitaire games before the child is ready for more challenging card games. There are also harder settings for more advanced players.\n\nThe story mode is okay but could be described as mostly background fluff. Your enjoyment will suffer only slightly if you decide not to pay attention. Again, it's something that would probably hold the attention of children pretty well. Overall, the story art, voice acting, and writing are reasonable for an indie game and you can tell the development team put a solid amount of effort into Faerie Solitaire.\n\nThis game has a serious lack of options and customizability. There aren't graphics options for this game, there is graphics option. A single switch labelled "high" and "low." So if you're hoping to change the game's resolution (like I was) or even turn off the card animations, you're out of luck. I also would have liked to see an option to change what the cards look like. Personally, I prefer how cards normally look as opposed to the cartoon-ish design the developers decided on.\n\nI'd recommend it to my young nieces and nephews, as well as my mother.","October 16, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean, if you like solitaire, this is a solitaire game, and it plays well.  It's similar to tripeaks solitaire.  In between the solitaire you have some story bits in the form of text during loading screens, and them some sortof cut scenes, which isn't terrible and can be skipped, and maybe has some suspense to it if you don't guess what's going on.  You're some kid tasked with chasing after the fairies to save them from something evil, or something like that.  And you play a lot of solitaire to save them, because it is pretty apparent you have the fighting skills of Atreyu from The Neverending Story when he killed the wolf simply by holding the sword the right way as he cowered when it pounced.\n\nI played this for about 27 hours and got all but two achievements.  Then I quit, because it's a painful grind to get all the eggs to randomly drop.  Then I came back after a couple months and my save game is deleted.  I looked online and this is a common issue, and the game does not and according to the devs will not support Steam's cloud sync.  Better find and back up your save game regularly.  Maybe even before finishing each level, because some of the tasks get really annoying when you play ten rounds to find that you didn't win enough of them, so start over.\n\nSo bottom line, it's cheap, tho not as cheap as that Klondike or Spider solitaire built into your Windows install.  You might see where the story is going long before they reveal it.  You may rage quit when you play fifty games in a row without an egg drop.  Your save game may just magically cease to exist.  Your friends may tease you for playing a game with "Faerie" in the title.  But if you enjoy passing the time playing card games, these other issues don't matter.","October 3, 2014","true","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasilZero/recommended/38600/","BasilZero","Basilicious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasilZero/","900 products in account","Game: Faerie Solitaire\nGenre: Puzzle\nDeveloper: Subsoap\nSystem: Steam (PC)\nTotal Score: 76/100\nValue Score: 7.6/10\n\n• Story: 7/10\no Basically a story involving a character who goes on a journey in a mysterious world. The game continues the storyline as you go through the levels in a artistic view of the surrounding world of the game.\n\n• Characters: 5/10\no Basically there are a few characters, your character whose identity isnt even known or a focal point, a bunch of faeries who play different roles and make an appearance in the storyline and your pets you can collect and grow.\n\n• GamePlay: 8/10\no Basically the game is like Solitaire except you can do all sorts of tricks and be encountering certain obstacles which can be destroyed by attempting certain combos. Each level and stage has a unique goal or requirement such as completing a level in a amount of time, having a certain number of combos or making enough money. At the end of each stage you gain a bit of money from you gained during gameplay and as a extra bonus. You can use these extra amounts of money to purchase different abilities and locations - along with the money you also receive or find items during the gameplay which you can use to feed your pet and thus make them stronger.\n\n• Graphics: 7/10\no The game has a unique art style but pretty much any PC should be able to run this game. Very basic visual design more like a art book. The storyline is depicted through the fancy artwork and the animations within the gameplay and the menus are well done.\n\n• Sound: 8/10\no The sound effects are like what you would expect in a fairy tale type of setting of a story. The usual magical incantation sound effects and etc. The sounds are actually well done.\n\n• Music: 7/10\no For each level there's a different track used which plays a soothing calm song representing the stage's environment. The game's menu music is well done, nothing special with the entire OST but it is a nice departure from what you would hear from the usual games as this game's OST fits well with its casual feel.\n\n• Length: 8/10\no There are several levels and stages with about over 8 chapters with several stages. Going through them and playing the game of solitaire may take you a while - each play should take you about anywhere between 5-10 minutes depending on the number of cards and obstacles.\n\n• Replay Value: 9/10\no Although there are specific obstacles in each stage the number of cards and which cards are stacked are always different so each time you play any level in any stage it is always different. Along with that even after you finish the game's main storyline there may be some extra items you can purchase or train more pets which will add a few more hours overall to your game time.\n\n• Player Value: 7/10\no If you are looking for a casual game that doesnt require a lot of PC power - something to get your time by and something that is actually quite simple and can be as fun as a casual game such as regular solitaire - then this is the game for you because it adds more than regular solitaire - a unique way to play the game along with a storyline to boot along with a well fantasy like OST and overall visual design.","December 30, 2013","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Look at him! I didn't know they had popped-collar polo shirts in the FaeWild, but there you go. I'm sorry, but I cannot take this game seriously when, right from the outset, I am placed in the shoes of Sparklehair McFaedouche here. This is not on.\n\nSpeaking of hair, his hair is also stupid. Think of that in the context of the game. There are faries everywhere with their own elemental, beehive junk dolloped like soft-serve icecream on their heads. Glitter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed everywhere. And still, this tardbarge wins it for the dead Chocobo rotting on his scalp. Look at the picture! He is surprised it's there. Like he just realized that hair is, in fact, a thing that is a thing. It's like an infant discovering he has hands.\n\nThen there's his voice. Holy Jesus-burger-flipping-meat-patty-CHRIST his ♥♥♥♥ing voice. It's just bad. Not wildly inappropriate-bad. Not Street-Fighter-live-action-goes-full-circle-and-becomes-awesome-bad. BAD-bad. House of the Dead-bad, minus the irony. Every single line is delivered in this over-excited voice akin to a home-schooled 13 year old excited about going to his mum's book club because he actually gets to meet other people. And it just gets worse and worse because they're playing this whole faerie thing dead-straight so when things get dra~ma~tic, he still sounds like the same bright-eyed cub scout successfully tying a reef knot he was when he first started out on this self-inflicted idiot-quest.\n\nThen there's the way this bumble♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥tumbles his way ♥♥♥-first through the plot. I swear, it's the most pants-on-head, spoon-in-ear, ♥♥♥♥-your-pants, blowing-spit-bubbles-in-your-high-chair ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing I have ever witnessed. Did the little spastic ever think to himself, "Oh gee, I wonder if the dark, creepy looking wizard just GIVING out mysterious staffs of power/civil service jobs is evil? I wonder why all of these faries are ♥♥♥♥ing terrified out of their minds of the staff and the destructive power I keep on raining down on them from it like the skies of ♥♥♥♥ing Sodom? Maybe I should stop, esentially, being a terrorist, turn around and go the ♥♥♥♥ home?" He was the catalyst for every bad thing that happened and he did it because he dicked around with a magic relic he got from a robed hobo in the street and was too stupid to simply stop destroying property and killing things. gg, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I wondered why the fairy queen then entrusted this stone-cold idiot with a magic sword (again, a tool he knew nothing about wielding) when she finally filled the little ♥♥♥♥ in on the calamity he himself was bringing, but a theory occured to me; it was actually the magic, sex-offender's spellbook bookmark and, by illusion-magicing it into the shape of a sword and sending the little tosschump to his doom, she's be getting rid of the both of them. Spoilers, by the way.\n\nThe actual game has abso-bloody-lutely nothing to do with Solitaire, but the gameplay is much, much better than the free version you have had on every computer since 1995. Better enough to even fork over some dosh to pay for this game, even. I paid all of about 50 cents for it. Still worth it.","July 15, 2013","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/voards/recommended/38600/","voards","Middle Aged Nerd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/voards/","381 products in account","Steam really needs an "in-between" rating.  Overall it’s a fun modification of solitaire and a somewhat addictive casual time killer.  There's in-game money (not real money with microtransactions) you can earn to buy items that can effect gameplay in your favor, and there are various challenges in each level, plus a whole extra level of multiple challenges.\n\nHowever, it does have several negative points that make it not worth $10.  Buy it on sale or find one of the many 90% off coupons floating around Steam.\n\nBe prepared for the sub-par graphics.  After about 2000 no game developer would consider making a game with a highest possible resolution of 800x600.  And yet Subsoap did - in 2010.  Why?  You either play in tiny windowed mode or you play full screen with stretchy and sometimes blocky graphics.\n\nFalse or misleading claims:\n\n“40 Unique Fantasy Locations to Explore” and "Adventure Mode: Explore the world of Avalon" – Explore is an extremely incorrect and misleading verb.  You aren’t exploring anything – only going from one background plate to another.\n“Earn achievements as you play - 30 To Collect In All” – Two of them are apparently bugged and either unobtainable or require 50+ game hours.\n\n“Fantasy Story Complete with 8 Hand Painted Cutscenes” – the story reads like slash fanfiction written by a 13-year old girl and it’s voiced by a guy who sounds like he’s doing a parody of Keanu Reeves in Dracula.","March 19, 2014","true","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With cute collectible pets and powerups that help you clear the board of cards more easily, Faerie Solitare gives a neat, relaxing challenge to anyone who's a fan of card games or casual gaming.\n\nThe only thing I didn't appreciate was the highly obvious cliffhanger ending as an excuse to make another game.

It's relaxed, with lute/harp/whatever-esque strums used as you move through menus. You have nature sounds in the background as you play through the game, and you get nice musical overtures when you complete a stage.\n\nThe game is pretty-- not ground-breaking graphics or anything, but everything about it looks nice. It's a card game and it understands that. It never tries to be overly fabulous. It's two-dimensional, it's got good artwork, and things have auras and sparkles and glows. Don't let that last bit throw you off-- it's subtle enough that it won't annoy you.\n\nYou'll find eggs and materials and stuff like that to grow baby pets into badass not-baby pets. You get dragons and all that good stuff. You also unlock power-ups and improvements to your game; stuff like improved hatching speeds, seeing how many cards you have left in your deck, and cheat codes where you can see what's the next card in the stack.\n\nBut the thing that matters the most is that the game is just ♥♥♥♥ing fun. It's casual and it accepts that. It's the game you play when you're tired but can't sleep, when you don't want to think too hard, or you're in the middle of searching for a match on LoL or whatever you play and it's taking a very long time.

I was quite surprised with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you like Solitaire-style card games, faery themes, and raising dragons, then you might enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are decent - the amount of detail in the cards are very simple. The music and sounds are okay - they do add to the mystical/relaxing vibe emitted by the game - but I quickly muted the music in favor of my own.\n\nControls are super simple and only involve mouse clicking. There is no tutorial, but tips are always provided when a new element is introduced. The learning curve is mostly non-existent to minimal depending on your knowledge of card games involving a standard deck of 52.\n\nGameplay consists of you trying to clear a randomized arrangement of cards before running out of cards in your deck (Solitaire-style format). You start by drawing a card, and must click on cards in the play area to interact with your active card. Unlike Solitaire, you can click on cards exactly one value higher or lower than your active card. For example, you start a level and draw a 5 - you can now click on any 4's or 6's in the play area (note that you cannot click on 5's). Chaining combos are important in this game because it will allow you to build up your score meter faster, resulting in more money awarded and a better end score. Your end score fills up a "global" meter that is shown at the end of every level (or hand). After 9 hands, you must have accumulated enough points to free a captured faery. There is always one level objective that lasts for all 9 hands (ex: achieve a 8-chain combo), and completing this will boost your score and money.\n\nNew mechanics are added as you progress through the game to keep things challenging. One includes a vine stack that cannot be accessed until you clear a separate stack of cards that has a flower at the end. Another common one is an ice stack of cards that can only be used if you first click a "fire" card, which is usually located beneath many other cards.\n\nMoney is used to buy upgrades in the Faereland in the form of buildings. These upgrades will give you things like an extra undo (you start with only 1 and can get up to a maximum of 3) and a count of how many cards are left in your deck. Sometimes, resources will also drop when you clear a stack of cards - these are used to hatch and evolve your dragons. Yes, dragons.\n\nAfter playing for a while, you will eventually find a dragon egg (there are a large number of dragon variants). You can hatch them once you've accumulated enough resources (there are 3 kinds). Your dragon will start as a baby, and you can select one active dragon at a time - your active dragon will gain experience whenever you win a hand. Once your dragon receives enough experience, it will evolve and have some lore you can read.\n\nBesides the standard story mode, there is a challenge mode and the ability to replay previous levels.\n\nOverall, the game plays well for a Solitaire-based game with extra elements to keep it from running dry. If you are interested in this style of gameplay, then give it a try. I try not to mention price if I feel it is unnecessary, but I got this game when it was discounted at 95% ($0.54 CAD) and sincerely think that this is not worth the full price at all ($10.99 CAD). The content is just far too shallow to warrant that price, when countless other titles exist for the same, if not lower price.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n","May 12, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For those serious hardcore gamers, whether it be FPS or RPG, this game is for everyone. It is perfect for those days when you honestly just do not want to care about anything. not your kda, not leveling up or PvP,  just sitting back and flipping through some cards. To be totally honest I probably would not have played this game if it did not have steam achievments. That is the cherry on top because not only is it solitaire, but there is a goal to work towards. If you ever feel like attempting something not yet impossible, but just so time consuming then I welcome you to care about this games eggs/ pet system. Other than the achievments I have yet to see a purpose behind it. This games soundtrack is about as exciting as watching grass grow, makes elevator music seem like heavy metal. The narrator behind the story has a very weak, pre- teen voice that I just could not stand to listen to.

You match up cards in ascending and descending values, trying to pull all of the cards on the board in to the discard deck.  The entire board doesn't need to be cleared to win.  However, if all of the cards from the board, you win prizes that can be used to hatch eggs and raise fantasy creatures.  The fantasy creatures are completely non-interactive, and are displayed like museum pieces.  Each set of hands completed advances the fairy tale storyline, which is pretty bland.  The problem with the story is it is released in such small pieces that it is sometimes hard to follow.  The story is boring, but thankfully the card game itself isn't so bad.

This also is an excellent game to play while waiting for queue-based online games, since it can be saved and stopped mid-round and picked up again at a later time.\n\n\n[Full]\nPlaying on the traditional card game of Solitaire with a whimsical twist, Faerie Solitaire can provide a lot of play hours with the unlockables. These are the game-level power-ups that aid you in completing each round and pets that can be found, hatched, and grown as you play. The game, to me, has a zen-like soundtrack which made the experience, while playing or while it's in the background, that much more captivating. Each zone of the story lead to new game-play elements to plan for when trying to complete a round. The story, while minimal, includes artwork and a bit of dialogue. I believe this game to have a good amount of replayability, as each round is (seemingly) randomized.","December 5, 2013","true","41.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also love the cute, fairy graphics, much nicer on the eyes than plain old cards. The added pet element adds fun as well, reminding me somewhat of pokemon. You can find eggs under certain cards, hatch them, raise them and find certain gems to help them evolve.\n\nThere are also certain bonuses you can save up funds to buy, like extra undos and power ups that work from cards you can't use. I also liked the journey/adventure part of this.\n\nEach level has 9 levels you have to beat, and each level of nine has certain goals. Like completing X amoung perfectly, or earning X amount of $ or getting X amound of combos in a row.\n\nI really liked all these aspects as it made a whole new game out of solitaire, adding new challenges and making the replayability high and fun!

Luckily there was this game to fill up that free time.  Faerie Solitaire manages to be even more addicting than the real thing by both simplifying and complicating the original formula.  By removing the need to swap red/black suits and adding other methods to eliminate cards, this reinvention of one of the original time wasters has managed to eat up almost 10 total hours of my life that I may never get back, but never planned on using constructively anyway.\n\nThis game will not surprise you, (It's Solitaire, what do you expect?) but it will do it's job.  The story mode is just a framework for more time-wasting card-matching fun, and there are other things to keep you busy.  If you're looking for a reinvention of an old classic, Faerie Solitaire will give you exactly that.","February 8, 2013","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You match up cards in ascending and descending values, trying to pull all of the cards on the board in to the discard deck.  The entire board doesn't need to be cleared to win.  However, if all of the cards from the board, you win prizes that can be used to hatch eggs and raise fantasy creatures.  The fantasy creatures are completely non-interactive, and are displayed like museum pieces.  Each set of hands completed advances the fairy tale storyline, which is pretty bland.  The problem with the story is it is released in such small pieces that it is sometimes hard to follow.  The story is boring, but thankfully the card game itself isn't so bad.  Overall, the game is really easy, and doesn't take too much thinking.  A good distraction if you have some time to waste.","January 7, 2014","true","25.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays very much like a Popcap game (Peggle, Insaniquarium, etc.) in that the gameplay is single click, very basic strategy level gameplay. You build sequences of cards together with some minor strategy thrown in, but don't expect much in the way of challenge. Like Popcap games, someone on the development team wasted their time creating a useless story. Like the Popcap games, the story doesn't do anything for the gameplay and might as well not exist. It's a nice casual game, the best recommendation I can give is to go to Youtube, watch a bit of gameplay footage, and if it seems like something you might like, pick it up.\n\nAs a final note, the game is not worth 10 dollars, highly recommend waiting until you can find this on sale unless you get really interested.

For those serious hardcore gamers, whether it be FPS or RPG, this game is for everyone. It is perfect for those days when you honestly just do not want to care about anything. not your kda, not leveling up or PvP,  just sitting back and flipping through some cards. To be totally honest I probably would not have played this game if it did not have steam achievments. That is the cherry on top because not only is it solitaire, but there is a goal to work towards. If you ever feel like attempting something not yet impossible, but just so time consuming then I welcome you to care about this games eggs/ pet system. Other than the achievments I have yet to see a purpose behind it. This games soundtrack is about as exciting as watching grass grow, makes elevator music seem like heavy metal. The narrator behind the story has a very weak, pre- teen voice that I just could not stand to listen to. The good thing about this game is that every cut scene is skippable.\n","January 18, 2014","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a simple solitaire game based on matching with higher or lower card numbers. There's plenty of layouts with no penalty for not finishing each hand completely. On top of this the game introduces different powerups and obstacles that adds more complexity, strategy, and difficulty to the game. There are also level goals that need to be met to add extra challenge when playing. The story deals with a hero and his quest centered around faeries. The adventure spans different environments that reflects a change in background and music. The visuals look pretty which adds a nice touch and the music compliments the game well.

There's upgrades to buy, and many pets to collect and grow. Collecting all the pets can be a chore though, since the eggs they hatch from are randomly spawned from game to game, so sometimes you can go dozens of games without seeing an egg. Well, towards the end of the pet collecting anyway. At the beginning you get them at a decent rate, but around the halfway mark it starts to slow down. Also, it takes 'time' to hatch and then mature. Each card you click will tick down it's 'hatching' and/or 'growing timer, so it can take a while.\n\nHowever, the pet feature is completely optional. This is the kinda game people buy when they either want a coffee break game, or they're a huge fan of solitaire games. Either way, you'll be playing this game a lot normally and the pet feature is a nice thing to do on the side, which for long term players is the only thing left on the side.\n\nThere's an upgrade system which will make playing more convieniet, however it doesn't take too long to max those out and afterwards the only thing left is the pet feature and solitaire... which is great too.\n\nOverall, this is just a great game and the devs are great people. Back when this game was first released, the devs were generous enough to host many giveaways in various communities, giving away quite a few copies, which is how I got mine.\n\nAs for the current price point, I feel $10 is a good price considering that this game has given me more hours than an uncomfortable number of AAA.","June 17, 2014","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
