"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltmummy626/recommended/403200/","saltmummy626","saltmummy626","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltmummy626/","411 products in account","Once again, dreamatrix shows that it is perfectly willing to rip people off.\n\nBefore you continue reading, this reveiw was originally written after playing 0.4 hours of total playtime. The response from dreamatrix was "saltmummy626 0.4 hrs on record, you actually have no clue what we changed inside." I have comitted another three or so hours to LoDR, and am ready to say that "yes, I do have a clue of what you changed, and that is hardly anything at all." and so, my review remains, except for this paragraph, unchanged. It's easier to push negative reviews under the rug when it looks like people have hardly touched the game I guess. Read on potential buyer, and you'll get what I mean.\n\nTHE COMMUNITY-DEVS\nLegends of dawn is a game made about two or so years ago. Two or so years of empty promises and exagerated claims on the part of dreamatrix caught up with them in the sheer number of negative reveiws their barely functioning framework had garnered. One day, fairly recently, they decided that they would slap "reborn" on the title and re-release it and take down the games older listing. By the way, taking down the games older listing also took down the negative reviews and the amount of time played by the negative reveiwers, which was undoubtedly the plan all along.\n\nThe community around this game is mostly made up of dissatisfied customers regularly getting banned and thrown out of the games forums and steam community page, and a very small, caustic, sect of zealous fans. Moderators and the developers on the forums and community hub for this game are unhelpful and downright unfriendly, especially towards people with complaints or bug reports. "We are a small studio." is the go to excuse for dreamatrix when it comes to serious bugs, disregarding the fact that other smaller studios have made far superior games with fewer horrendous bugs.\n\nTHE GAME ITSELF\nThe game itself? It is almost a complete copy paste of the "old" version. same game, very few changes. Same ability to devour your computers memory and run poorly regardless of it's power and the games outdated graphics. Same stock sound effects and music which is suspiciously similar to music from other games. Same awful character creator with the same races (Human, Elf, Ferengi.) Same equipment peices which are no better than other equipment peices (a steel helmet still gives the same defense as a cloth hat.) Same abymsal voice acting. Same miniscule FOV. Same enemies which detonate hilariously when they are killed. Same NPCs who do not care that a stranger is in their home, stealing their underwear. Same Same Same. The only "improvement" I saw was a change to the games already fairly creative lockpicking system and magic system. Some other changes I saw were the massively reduced inventory size and reworked crafting. Both of which work together to make the experiance slightly more unpleasant. Oh yeah, another change? even though this is the same as the old one, they somehow have the audacity to raise the price a full 10$. maybe that doesnt sound like a lot, but 30$ is a hell of a lot to pay for a product as shoddy as this. Even if it were free, you would still be paying too much. I only wish I could find the backup I made of the old reveiw so I could repost it here, becuase everything in it still stands.\n\nSome stuff from the games description on the store page.\n- Legends of Dawn Reborn is a 64-bit ONLY title. Streaming technology enables playing without any loading screens. All data seamlessly loads in background- except there are loading screens. They suddenly appear when you travel long distances, a bit like the little bar that said "loading" which would appear at the bottom of the screen in morrowind, except LoDs is a splash screen and not an unobtrusive bar.\n\n- Expandable huge inventory with bags with item stacking and sorting- well item stacking is a nice new feature, but you still collect a large amount of valueless junk which uses up that small "upgradable" space pretty quick.\n\n- A completely new informative tooltips with all data about single item type, including runes, potions and spells; Important data about magic level, crafting etc.- screen filling, and confusing. There is such a thing as "too much information." also, these tooltips will compare your weapon to your food for some bizarre reason, which just takes up twice as much screen real estate.\n\n- Additional combat animations- Not really, no.\n\n- Major upgrade with keyboard and mouse navigation - A Bald faced lie, the controls are exactly the same.\n\n- With full freedom, explore hundreds of unique locations;- If you don't get stuck on the geometry and have to load your game that is. It's pretty easy to do too, the pathfinding is prehistoric and youll clip into objects you are trying to interact with, and get stuck in them and even though you are stuck on the container, you still won't be able to open it becuase you aren't positioned right.\n\n- Hundreds of types of wild creatures and monsters that drop loads of loot;- eh. Don't you know? Creature variants don't actually count as another creature type. just becuase you change the color and size, it doesn't mean you have made a new creature.\n\n- Legends of Dawn is no longer supported or available for purchase;- Except for an extra ten bucks on this store page. "Look, we put "Reborn" in the title! that means it's a whole new game right?"\n\n- If you already purchased LoD do not buy this LoD Reborn, you are qualified to get it free of charge.- Just their way of making it look less like a scam.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\nDo not buy, do not buy, DO NOT BUY!\nIf you really MUST buy this game, than all I can say is: Welcome to the septic tank, thank god steam offers refunds now.","October 21, 2015","false","3.2"," 206 of 234 people (88%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","88","206","234","19","16"

But I can not recommend this game for it's current price point. This game was originally a kickstarter which I was one of the backers. The game was terrible, graphics were terrible, the engine was terrible. At first most players couldn't even open the game. The developers attempted to patch it and while it did address some of the concerns, it really did nothing to improve the game. Now the older version of the game is removed from Steam which had a ton of negative reviews. Yes everyone who bought the game before received this game for free. However, my main concerns for this Legends of Dawn: Reborn are still present. I didn't even need to play any more than five minutes before it hit me in the face.\n\n1. Pathfinding is terrible. You click for your character to move and often will be stopped by objects that should have a clear path around it.\n\n2. No tutorial! Come on guys I know this game is suppose to have an "old school style" but let's face it we need some basic controls to be explained so that we do not rage quit in the first minute of the game.\n\n3. The character generation is just plain ugly. Now I don't need good graphics to enjoy a game. However, if that is going to be the case please balance it with amazing gameplay.\n\n4. While not a factor for me, but this games price point is just way to high. Not worth it.\n\n","October 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 215 of 298 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","215","298","6","10"

I can not recommend this game except as an ALPHA build for a college students proof of concept. This is in no way fit to be released into modern market, even as a "retro return" to classic RPGs.\n\nMy rig for arguments sake\n\nWin7 64bit Ultimate\n24 gig ram\nFX9370-oc-4.7ghz\nR9-390x 8gb\n\n\nSHORT TL:DR review\n\nTOTAL 3.8/10\n\nStory 7.5/10\nGraphics 3/10\nGameplay 1/10\n\nPROs\n-Custom Difficulty Design\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539215438\n-Fully Voiced conversations\n-Story is nice\n\nCONs\nTextures\nInterface\nIntroduction gameplay\nWorld design\nGraphic Engine limitation\nOver all gameplay\nPlayer Character Creation\n\n\nLONG REVIEW\n\nFirst off, you will feel like it is very Baldurs Gate 1, and I mean BG1, classic, not redux version.\n\nStory 7.5/10\nStorywise, from what I could encounter, 7.5/10, good world premise, voice acted scripts with generic NPC's. Overall not horrible, the story itself is fine, and in a better gameplay style perhaps even superior.\n\nGraphics 3/10\nBTW game ran at 35 FPS MAXED OUT....and maxed out looked like crap on a cracker\nCharacter creation graphics are on par with NWN2. Which is not horrible, but not great either. There's a list for modding so community overhauls could in theory be designed\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539215344\nwhat does irk me in character creation, facial hair can not be matched to head hair\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539215397\n\nI'm not saying a game has to be shiny, games don't have to be shiny, but modern games do have to have a basic level of antialiasing and world detail. When i said BG1 i meant BG1, shadows are blocky low res and jaggy, same with everything in the game. you can not used enhanced options from AMD Catalyst or NVIDA software because it breaks the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539215469\nwith forced options\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539227534\nwith USE APPLICATION SETTINGS\n\nlook at the shadow cast by the ropes, these are on MAXIMUM settings, look at all the edges everywhere, it's just painful. granted graphics don't really affect gameplay, but this is fairly horrible. Even retro style games like Divinity OS, and BaldursGate remastered use modern AA methods\n\nGameplay 1/10\nThis is where the game really suffers, I'm not saying a HUGE DEEP walk through is needed, but this is horrid. From character creation to your first moments in the game you are given no feedback on what affects what.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539215316\nnothing is told to you on how stats will affect the game or that TRADING is like 80% of this games system, really, the game goes deep deep into trades and politics, which is fine except that you aren't told that Charisma and talking is going to be more valuable then swinging a sword,\nBasic Movement is HORRIBLE, almost broken\nin the first few moments of the game you talk to the NPC nearby, he tells you to go aboard the ship, 5 HORRID path finding minutes later you manage to get over the lip of the ramp onto the ship to find gear. Apparently height difference breaks path finding, you can't path find up ramps, stairs, any elevation. All movement in this game is path finding, even if your mouse pointer is a CM away, if it's over a lip of elevation like a single stair case, you have a 50% chance of just stopping at the first step.  I got onto the ship by WASD, which for an "over the top view 3rd person" game is miserable. The crate with gear, was not highlightable unless i moused over it, on a ship of crates that are identical and not interactable (also you need to figure out on your own what interacts with things, careful though you may interact with a friend by swinging your sword.....\n\nOK so basic movement needs work, controls need to be explained. You find a locked box early early on and come across an 8x8 grid of runes, a key and no explanation at all followed by an UNLOCK button at the bottom of the UI...What the hell? I never figured out how to open locks, but considering nothing in that 8x8 grid was interactable I ASSUME i'm missing something, not that I would know what I was missing. From then on it's down hill, find the tavern.. Buildings aren't labeled, unless you open up the screen covering map and highlight buildings you've already been to, to get their names... How about a Flagon on a tavern? NOPE, not there, How about a smart village design, Taverns need to be near trade passages like docks, not on the far side of town next to a forest, basic commercial sector design has driven town placement in RPG's since the 1990's, no thought was placed in this, making navigation of the town irksome. You wouldn't place a prison next to a school for young children, unless you live in this world apparently.\n\nBasicaly gameplay, from navigation, to interacting with the world is miserable, like no thought was placed into how a player would or should interact with the game.\n\nSUMMATION\nin the hands of another studio this game would be awesome, keep the isometric BG1 style, put a better level design team, engine design team, game play design team in charge. Very little of the concept of the game has to be changed, but the interaction of the player to the game it self is unacceptable at any price. at best, this should be an ALPHA proof of concept, it is not BETA quality, let alone a RE-RELEASE quality.\nDisappointing, the intro movie story was interesting, but the games flaws are too jarring to work with. IP should be sold to Larian studios. The devs should go back to school or play OTHER ISOmetric games to understand what makes a playable game.","October 21, 2015","false","0.5"," 89 of 119 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","89","119","4","1"

I really was!  Sure, they released a hot mess the first time, and as a Kickstarter backer, I'm not elegable for a refund, and really had no other choice, but hey!  Maybe they had learned from their mistakes and made it better!  This bit of their email announcing the rerelease worried me however:\n\n"Therefore, we are taking this opportunity to humbly ask you to post a "Positive" review on Legends of Dawn Reborn Steam page. That is, if you enjoyed Legends of Dawn and recognized our willingness to keep improving it.\nOn the other hand, if some of you don’t like Legends of Dawn, even after so many changes and improvements, we kindly ask you to refrain from negative reviews and posts for the sake of others who would like to experience further development and improvements."\n\nHm...  Okay.  They've had some rough spots, and there were some bruised feelings.  Maybe they just want to try a fresh start.  I can accept that.  I gave it a try!  I waneted to see what had changed.  The answer?  Nothing of note.  I gues it looks moderately better, but the controles and UI are still awful, combat is still a tedious click fest (seriously, I have to click for EVERY swing?  I can't just hold down the button?) And all the bad design and art decisions are still there (Their elves manage to out ugly The Elder Scrolls' elves) What really gets me is this second email:\n\n"Since the release on Steam, Legends of Dawn Reborn is overrun by the negative reviews, and yet we somehow believe that people who actually play and enjoy the game kept their silence."\n\nReally?  You believe that, do you?  Well Dreamatrix, you can believe whatever you want I guess, but the evidence is quite clearly to the contrary.  Now, I don't believe the devs are trying to bilk us out of money.  I don't think this is some kinda scam.  I think they really do what to make a greak game!  They're just not very good at it.  I'm sorry Dreamatrix, I really do think you tried, but  you aren't living up to the games you're trying to emulate, and no amount of walls of text, or rereleases will fix that.  You just made too many bad decisions in developement. Too many of your systems are just no good. (combat and the awdul rune chest unlocking thing at the top of the list) It's time to really re-evaluate your design decisions before releasing another game, and really considder that your audience might be being honest with you!\n\nYou tried, Dreamatrix, but it's really not us.  It's you.  This game just isn't as good as you want it to be, and you need to go back to the drawing board, and listen to people about why that is.

It is a scam. I am not stating that ironically, or to be malicious; this game is unequivocally the buggiest, most poorly managed, poorly updated, and awful piece of garbage that has graced Steam's greenlight program.\n\nBUT, for the sake of a review, lets discuss why.\n\nEntire subsystems and 'class mechanics' dont work.\nPathing is a nightmare, and its possible to get stuck in terrain, path through cliffs and never be able to walk back up them, etc. You can die from falling a foot, and die from falling in water.\nTextures and meshes seeming load in and out of the camera's view randomly. Entire houses will pop up around you, or disappear entirely as you're walking into them.\nProgression is entirely arbitrary. Items are random, quests may or may not work depending on the alignment of the stars, "dialogue" is schizophrenic and characters will seemingly have entirely random or baseless reactions to spoken text.\nSkill progression and pseudo-class progression is trivial and unimaginative. (The only exception being the ability to craft magic)\nThe graphics are abysmal, character models, NPCs, and monsters appear to have been created using software from 1998.\nThe camera and movement controls are horrifically limited. The camera will only allow about a 620x480 field of view, no matter the resolution you're attempting to play it in.\nAnything and everything can be locked, and the 'rune' system to unlock ANYTHING is never explained and so convoluted theres multiple sections of the manuel that attempt to cover it.\nThe storyline is non-existent.\nThe game has hardware and technical issues, crashes, buggy meshes / textures, etc, etc.\nInventory and item management is a chore, and I had found myself not even bothering to loot drops at a certain point.\n\nI can go on. Honestly, I havent even listed half of the things wrong with this travesty of a title, but hopefully this will suffice. AVOID. THIS. TITLE.\n\nI dont even hate the developers, im sure they're great people. Im sure they're nice and loving and wonderful individuals. However, they have produced one of the absolute worst titles to ever hit steam, and I cannot in good faith recommend this to anyone. Seriously.\n\nDont even buy this for 50 cents.

Not just yes or no.  Why, well, because I'd like to recommend the game based on the open world aspect, as well as all the little details that went into making this game.  From things like spell crafting all the way to the smaller details like picking locks.\n\nBUT.....\n\nThere are quite a few points about this game that make me cringe whenever I try to play.  And I have played both the original, and have started to play the "reborn" version (and I say that lightly, because like many others have said, not much has changed.)\n\nMy biggest gripe, and some would see this as something not worth griping about, is movement, or travelling, etc.  It takes a dog's age to get anywhere!  There is no "fast travelling".  Then add that to the already slow and clunky moving character, and well.  Hope you're up for long journeys from A to B.\n\nWhich leads me to my next gripe.  There is absolutely no quest markers, at all.  What kind of adventurer would go out on a quest and not mark their map in some way so that they know where they should go, where they should look, and who to return to once the objective is complete?  You can easily spend several hours just trying to figure out who it was that gave you what quests, and where the heck you're supposed to even go to begin, let alone finish... oh, and once you do figure it out, it takes FOREVER to get there and back again.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  The game has got a lot going for it.  But some times it's the little things that can really make or break.\n\nI, for one, will continue to bust through this, it might just take me a year or two to do it.  :-)","March 29","false","4.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I decided to download the Legends of Dawn Reborn and see how it flies. There are definite improvements and it is much better than the first iteration. I am enjoying exploring it so far though the learning curve on stuff is steep, the game does not 'hold your hand' like modern games. The game firmly reminds me of 'old school' games from when I was a kid, it has the same kind of feel to it. I suspect the people who are being negative about it are expecting it to equal Elder Scrolls, which is somewhat unfair. I would say it is a game on the same level as FATE but with better scenery and an actual plot: if you liked FATE then you may like this game. Just don't go into it expecting Elder Scrolls.","October 29, 2015","true","0.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

At a time I checked the reviews, the most were the negative ones, and currently they still are. The most of the reviews say that nothing is changed in the game. Also those "0.1 hours" reviews seem like, oh let's just review the game, so those idiot developers could get as much as negative reviews because I hate them.\n\nI played around 8 hours in the game, and here are my impressions.\n\nFirst, let's start with the NEGATIVE ones:\n\n- the visuals are the same\n- the combat is still rather clunky and there is a lot of "misses", which is pretty tiresome\n- some locations in the game look beautiful, but others look... not so much\n- if you don't have the patience, you will have difficult time with some quests because there is no tutorial to explain how some things work in the game\n- bugs\n\nNow, let's shift to the POSITIVE aspects of the game:\n\n- the story is pretty good, and for some strange reason, it grows on you. I want to do more and explore more\n- much better map\n- the world is HUGE, and there is a lot to see and to find\n- crapload of loot\n- much better inventory system to manage that loot\n- "crafting" spells can be fun\n- there is a certain charm in the stuff that is not explained, because you have to figure them out by yourself. If you have the patience, the whole experience can be pretty rewarding\n- the developer still updates the game, which is a good sign\n- you get the game for free if you already have the original\n\nFinally, to say that the game is "crap" is just pure bashing. The game isn't all that great, but it isn't that bad either like others want to assure potential buyers. It sits somewhere in the middle, between "I like it" or "I hate it".\n\nI for one like it, and I would recommend it. If you have the patience.","October 22, 2015","true","8.6"," 23 of 50 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","23","50","2","1"

Not so much post-processed as others it really uses textures and bitmaps as designed, so everything is very detailled and clear. The world is almost seamless, just entering a dungeon requires some load but that's fast. It plays like an old action rpg like titan quest or sacred in the sense that you walk around with a top-down view. Controlling your char with mouse and keyboard is ok. You mis-click once in a while, especially on the starting ship but that ok once you get used to it.\n\nFighting is done by clicking right, which is fairly common. Your character swings nicely. I must say, the enemies are nicely detailed, reminding me of a upped version of Neverwinter Nights (2). And always funny when a fox fights alongside a giant spider :) I guess in real life they would not eat each other ;-)\n\nOf course this all come with a cost, which is that your PC will sound like a jet fighter. Never ever has a game beaten my system so badly. So kodos to the devs which really pull everything out of my system they can. My fans are blowing (didn't know I had them) and even my hdd began to read\write like a madman. Probably a swapfile or something but I guess when you have a ssd you wouldn't notice. Anyway, the game run without stuttering which is of course great. In that respece the game feels a bit like the 'old' game which also taxed your hardware. Of course you can tweak the display stuff so it's not that of a burden but perhaps it's a good indication that you need new hardware. I have a 770GTX but in a few days my new 970GTX arrives and I will give it another swing. Perhaps it will help, i'll report back.\n\nAll in all it could be a fun game with lots of text (some a bit cheesy, especially the speech) but i need to play it more. But let's not be a whiner and start positive!\n\nOh, only noticed one bug: I could walk into a crate (so the create and my puppet were 1) and was then lifted and was on top of the create. Could be a nice trick to get to a higher ground, but I guess this was unintentionally. The next time I could not walk into a crate.","October 24, 2015","true","3.9"," 19 of 43 people (44%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","44","19","43","7","0"

As you can imagine having so many games my patience is also limited, so after 20 minutes of trying all graphic settings and not being able to do anything my first thought was to delete it and move to something else.\nI took my time to write this for everyone like me who felt frustrated from the unresponsive unappealing first few minutes in the game but was still curious about this game.\nFirst experience (roughly less than 20 minutes): load the game in a decent specced computer, go through a not really informative character creation screen, interesting presentation of the game and lore, graphic horrendous, 2/4 seconds of delay from selecting an action and its realization, etc. After changing all possible graphic settings noticed no improvement and I closed the game frustrated.\nSecond experience (roughly an hour plus another hour of browsing in Internet): I noticed many people enjoyed the game so I thought they must have managed to play it. Some suggested to read the manual, and although if it presents really well the game setting and lore, it helps very little in how to configure the game or in explaining for example the character creation (if you are familiar with RPGs the instructions don’t tell much more than you already know but still leaves doubts regarding some game-specific mechanics). I then decided to change the graphic settings before loading the game. Closed the game and restarted to ensure the settings were applied and then I could load the game and start using it properly. Most commands can be configured but using the mouse to walk can be frustrating as the character will crash on any object on his path without trying to move around it. WASD controls work better especially after I discovered I can move the camera using the right button of the mouse. Conversations are ok and my inventory stuffed up pretty soon. There are several bugs, like the map functionality first time was loaded completely black leaving me wondering, but reopening it fixes the problem and is actually pretty clear and informative.\nIn summary after an initial frustration I found that the game is not bug-free but playable and the settings are actually really interesting. The developers, which is trying to build a trilogy, from the little I followed them (even through the second kickstarter I did not back) seem honest and caring about their game (they could have left and abandoned the project after the heavy critics of the first game, instead they republished a new version).  It’s not an early access game (although it receives some updates and some content from the second game) and as such it should (and I feel it is) playable. If you like the genre I would recommend to consider it on sale but if you don’t have the patience to configure the game and lose a significant amount of time just to start it avoid it.\nI will keep updating this review as I go through the game and I may even change my opinion, but so far I feel the lack of this kind of games and I’m willing to give this one a chance.","October 30, 2015","true","1.5"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"
