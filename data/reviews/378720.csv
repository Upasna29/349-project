What makes be "break the silence" is the pleasant and extraordinary surprise I had playing the game.\n\nI never heard of it until a couple of days ago(two days before release), I wasn't hyped and never heard about the company before.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I started playing the game:\n\nFully random world each time you play, no handmade scenarios, no premade campaign. Sound scary no? On the contrary, they manage to pull it off. Each world is beautifully generated, no odd stating points or placement of terrain etc. Each game you play is unique.\n\nNew lore: It's Slavic (or so they say) folklore. Is that enough to differentiate  the game lore from the generic fantasy  games out there? Yes it is. Just enough to keep you interested and too much that you have no idea what those creatures are and you have to either take notes or take random action against them.\n\nNo legion of units to manage, each unit is one piece, it has more skills and abilities that any RPG I've played and when they die, it's forever and you really feel it. Not just because you cared for them but because it brutally handicaps you. You can't recruit units when you want to. If you're not careful and build enough of the right buildings you don't even have enough units to survive(gather resources and defend).\n\nAll that micromanagement of units and building might sound scary but you only get one settlement in the game. That's right, you won't have a ton of cities, legions of units. No sir, one is all you get.\nThe world (planet) is trying to kill you. Only once have I experienced this feeling and that was  while playing Alpha Centauri (SMAC).\n\nA multitude of ways to defeat your enemies (aside from fighting).\n\nA unique card based combat system that is actually fun to play.\n\nHundreds and events and quests that remind me of King of the Dragon Pass.\n\nAll that originality for 15-20 euro. And coming from a small indies studio. My hat off to the devs. And a recommendation to anyone reading this to try the game. It's more than worth the price and time to learn the game (about one hour for me).\n","November 21, 2015","true","14.1"," 189 of 199 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","189","199","5","0"

This is one of the games i dare recommend to people without attaching a caveat lector.\n\nThree hundred seventy-three. That is, at the time of writing this review, the amount of games in my steam library. Yet despite having a fair amount of games to compare Thea too i just cannot find any combination of games that would adequate serve as a comparison. Thea manages to blend several game genres surprisingly well - you will see elements of the survival genre mixed with RPG, civilization (city-building) and roguelike-lite genre while playing the game. It also has a set of game systems that i do not recognize as being borrowed from other games in those genres. Thus, If you are looking for a refreshingly original title instead of the so-manieth title that is essentially a clone of another game you played before i can strongly recommend Thea.\n\nIntro - What is the game about?The premise of the game is that you are a god in a post-apocalyptic world, who managed to survive with a handful of followers. Your villagers have set up a new village and now it is up to you to make that village thrive and to uncover what happened to the world. Initially you will be focused on exploring the world around you by sending out expedition parties that map the world, find old ruins that can be looted for materials and fend of enemies that threaten your town. Meanwhile random events and an overarching main quest focusing on the fate of the world will keep you busy. If you wish to do so you are free to simply ignore the games main quest and focus on your village instead if that is your preference.\n\nOne thing of note is that the game is centered around this single village. You cannot build new villages or expand as you would in civilization-type games. Neither will you be be fielding gigantic armies to take over the world - you will instead start the game with about ten villagers in your town and thats all you have. Villagers are not a particularly renewable commodity either; They can and will die if you end up having bad luck or play poorly. Every lost villager actually hurts and this is not just due to them being a somewhat hard to replace resource. Each and every single one of your villagers has his own set of equipment, a class and a set of skills. You will know that the villager you lost was responsible for crafting half of the armors your other villagers use. You will know that the warrior that died had been around since the start of the game, slowly upgrading his stick sword to a full suit of armor and decent weaponry only to fall to a horde of skeletons. You will know all of them, and you will not want to lose any of them.\n\nCombat, Crafting and QuestsA point of interest is the games combat system, which is unlike any i played in this type of game. Combat and some of the other games activities resolve around a card game system that determines the outcome of each event. In this card system each of your villagers is represented by a card that contains their stats, skills and abilities in combat. Each turn you and your opponent play cards until all villagers and opponents are on the table, after which the actual resolution of the fight or challenge will take place. The rules of the card system are somewhat hard to describe in a review but in practice they works rather well, creating a system that is easy to learn but hard to master. There is plenty of tactical variety to the card system that allows you to develop optimal tactics and gear for your villagers, without taking overly long. An entire fight takes 1-3 minutes at most from start to finish.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the crafting system. The game map around the village is procedurally generated and randomly seeded with resources that can be harvested. Since you only have a single village retrieving these resources requires the formation of expedition parties that go and get them for you (Always a risk, since there are plenty of dangers on the world map). Each resource has its own quality and advantages that tie into the crafting system. For example: A recipe may have the base requirement for "Wood" and "Metal" to be added. If you add regular wood the result will be average, but if you add dark wood the crafted weapon will be stronger and have poison damage. The same applies for metal so you can mix and match the stats you want. Factor into this that each weapon type functions differently in the combat card game and you will end up with a resource gathering system that actually matters quite a bit.\n\nI cannot write in great detail about quests since the survival gameplay keeps distracting me time and again. So far i know that the game features both a a (long) storyline quest and random event quests. The former of these is the overarching story of the game while the latter happen at random. Each random event quest i encountered so far provides the player with a situation they must react to. If you see see slave hunter what would you do? Try and convince them to hand one over to you? Try and set up an ambush? Or just charge in yelling? Or perhaps... you just want to ignore the situation and walk away. So far i haven't encountered the same random event quest twice after about 20 hours of gametime though random quests are somewhat rare. Even so i am bound to believe the developers claim that the game contains 130k words of quests text - more than the average novel.\n\nConclusionNormally i like to end a review with a list of the games good and bad points but in this case i simply cannot - for the sheer reason i cannot really find any problem severe enough to warrant a specific mention. Yes, the game is early access and has a few bugs but they are being fixed exceptionally fast once reported. The developers themselves are highly active on the forum and listen and respond to criticism and suggestions which is always a plus - i think we all met companies on steam who prefer the reviled "Lock, ban and delete" approach when dealing with those matters.\n\nUsually i don't like writing reviews that only seems to sing praise without adding a critical note since a good review balances the positive and the negative aspects of a game. In this case I will be making the proverbial exception to the rule since complaining for the sake of complaining makes even less sense. If you actually managed to reach this line by reading this entire wall of text stop wasting time and buy the game. I am nigh certain you won't regret it - though you might end up regretting a lost night of sleep or two afterwards.","October 2, 2015","true","56.4"," 187 of 198 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","187","198","5","4"

I'm extremely glad I did.\n\nThe gameplay is extremely fun. Managing both your village and expeditions is a lot of fun and the landscape remains hostile and varied enough to keep you interested. In fact, there never comes a point where you feel "safe" when you step outside your village walls. There's always something worse coming out of the distant mists.\n\nThe crafting system is much deeper than it looks on the surface. Materials gathered from your expeditions are used to create items such as armor, tools, weapons, or structures and the quality of said materials reflects in the items. The crafting reminds me slightly of Star Wars Galaxies played at a strategic level ... find the best resource, send a team out to extract it, then come back to your base to build it. Only instead of the view of a single individual, you manage the entire village.\n\nThe storyline ... I haven't finished it yet. I'm intriqued by it, but it's not very invasive. I find myself putting off going to investigate some distant point on the map that my deity wants me to look into just so I can go gather a little more wheat to make some bread (sorry, obscure deity).\n\nThe interface felt clunky at first but a lot of my problems with it were due to poor documentation. Once I found the appropriate hotkeys things moved along a lot better. The graphics on any setting look great.\n\nThe card game that is used for combat is tough to figure out. At first I just auto-resolved all the battles to avoid it. Then later I found that I was getting into the card game in order to play extremely difficult battles. I don't know that I do better than the computer, but at least I know what went wrong.\n\nThere's some warts in the game still. I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs but there's some text errors. There's also some balance issues in that one thing you do will seem vastly overpowered compared to every alternative (goblins, I'm looking at you).\n\nI'm giving this a hearty recommend. Deep strategy players will feel like they missed out without this one in their library. I'm also intriqued by what a small, independent team did. This game grabs me as much as Civilization ever did, and I thought I'd become completely jaded by those sort of hex map genres. A lot of flops trying to recapture Master of Magic and Civilization burned me out. And then along comes a tiny, obscure studio who knocks it out of the park without making any of those outrageous claims or trying to follow tired old formulas. AND they're still working on it! Another sign that the big studios may be on their way out and we're entering into an exciting new era.\n\nIt's like a craft ale produced by a really good microbrewery by experts who really like craft ale.","November 23, 2015","true","80.8"," 130 of 139 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","130","139","7","0"

My wife will come kill me soon, I'm sure.\n\nThis game is brilliant.  The 4X portion of the game would be serviceable on its own, with interesting gathering/crafting mechanics for feeding your populace and equipping your fighters.  The writing does an excellent job of giving you an otherworldly feel; it makes me want to read the mythology its based on.\n\nThe combat card game is amazing.  I'd play the card game even without the 4X game.  The mechanics involved in that one I think would be deep enough to support even a living/expandable card game implementation.  The fact that it's tied to a whole plethora of hero stats for 6-7 different types of challenges (social, physical, combat, tactics, hex, etc.) that all play out in "combat" is what really makes the game shine.  The connection between your units leveling and equipment, the writing and events that get you wrapped up in various sorts of contests, and this "combat" system that provides the test of skill for resolving all of the conflicts is why the sum of the two decent games (the 4X game and the card game) becomes something amazing.\n\nThe designers behind this are geniuses.  I'm so impressed with this that I already want to buy their next game.","September 29, 2015","true","53.0"," 107 of 117 people (91%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","91","107","117","39","1"

However at it's core it is a turn based strategy game, not an RPG. You have a town, but it is not a 4x game as such. From what I see you only have the 1 town. Some of your people are gatherers, some are soldiers, some are crafters. You send the soldiers out to kill stuff, send gatherers with them if you want to gather as well. People are sent out in "expeditions".  The main resources here are food and fuel (for fire). All the other resources are basically optional, and used for crafting or putting up buildings in your town.\n\nTechnology is very simply done (but it works well). Choose weapons technology, get powerful ingredients and make amazing items. Or use tech to unlock more buildings and follow the growth path to victory.\n\nCombat is done unusually. Your units are placed as cards, enemy units are also cards. Some cards are attack and some are support (chosen randomly). The idea is to try and set up the best order of the cards before combat begins. The combat has a lot of depth, watching a video to figure it out is a good idea.\n\nThe game is very complex, especially figuring out how combat works. At the same time it is slow and almost relaxing game, until you watch your people die horribly and fail :(\n\n7/10 would die horribly again","November 20, 2015","true","20.6"," 91 of 102 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","91","102","7","0"

As a woman, it's nice to see some grave lady deities represented - Mokosh being my favorite.  Whoever did the art for this game deserves special recognition.\n\nSo much about this takes me back to my childhood, poring over old books and fantasy accessories for CRPGs and the old artwork in the Diablo booklets.  It has that classic, gritty 90's American pop-art style that will always be a part of my mental landscape.\n\nAs a game it functions well.  I'm a strategy addict, and a survival-game addict, so putting these two together ALONG WITH gorgeous art and serious mythological chops?  I couldn't be happier.\n\nWell, I could.  There are issues.\n\n- Tedious micromanagement.  I'm not a huge fan.  Some quality of life improvements would be great, chiefly, the ability to hit a single button when creating a new expedition and automatically supply it with, say, twenty or thirty days of a variety of food and fuel.  As it stands, this is the single most tedious thing in the game, having to manually drag every single item and manually enter in the numbers.  I'm old.  It hurts my poor hand after a while, and interrupts the flow of the game.\n\n- Weird card game combat.  Am I the only one who just clicks auto-resolve every time?  Like, EVERY time?  Even if I liked the card game (I don't really care for it) it doesn't add much to the experience, in my opinion.  This isn't Age of Wonders 3, we don't have the budget for a serious hex field and some turn-based combat, I get that.  It just feels like a waste of time.  But since it doesn't force itself on you, I suppose it's not a big deal.\n\nThose are my only two issues, really.  Some people have complained about the 'writing' being bad because the person who wrote this game's events and designed the world clearly has some incredibly MINOR issues with English.  I wouldn't even call them issues, it's more like reading an accent, which I enjoy, as it gets me looking at my native tongue in different ways.  "weakened, lost, and scared" I would have used 'frightened' or 'afraid' but they chose 'scared.'  Somehow, I find that more compelling.  It has a child-like quality to it.  It conveys that sense of helplessness better.  It is an excellent word choice, but I would have never done it.\n\nAs a professional, let me tell you: this writing is exceptional.  Some of the best writing I've ever seen was ESL.  Why?  Because of earnestness and enthusiasm, and storytelling.  Atmosphere.  See, the stray odd word usage actually spices up the world for me.  This game has soul.  It has so much obvious passion pushing behind every word and paragraph.  This game loves itself and it loves its players.  And with its sincere roots in myth, it can't go wrong.\n\nThe orcs I especially like.  They have this strange way of speaking with semi-modern slang.  I heard one reviewer complain about that - I've looked.  It's only the orcs who do that.  Chalk it up to cultural differences.  I found it charming, but, that's just my opinion.\n\nBuy this game, on sale or not.  I have four friends on my list who want this game but haven't bought it yet.  It's twenty dollars.  It's worth thirty.  Buy it.","December 7, 2015","true","35.7"," 68 of 72 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","68","72","2","6"

I love all three genres so I was thrilled to find them nicely mixed together in such a relaxing and fun to play title.\n\nPositives:+ Many ways to solve challenges! Maybe only half of the challenges in the game solved by combat- the other are solved by a myriad of other challenges that rely on other character skills, such as Social, Tactics, Hunting, Sickness, Hex, and Physical challenges, as examples.\n+ Choose your own adventure stories are great! I love actually being able to influence plot-lines by making varied choices. There are also many choices available only under certain conditions- and the game shows you how many fall in that category, making you always wonder what else you can unlock or accomplish to gain more choose your own adventure choice possibilities.\n+ You get attached to your townsfolk. As they gain experience their stats “level” on their own dependent on class, which may or may NOT raise their level. I actually ended up really liking this feature because it means some townsfolk get ahead of others. Also, there are many classes, but only 3 are widely available for selection when your children grow up to adulthood status: this means that uniquely classed characters are coveted and valued. I also love continually learning about new classes in the game- for instance, the “ghost” class.\n+ The challenge-solving card game turned out to be more strategically complex than I may have originally given it credit for. I actually look forward to playing the card game, though it can be a bit time-consuming (I recommend turning up the card play speed feature in the options)\n+ Fun gear crafting: rewarded for experimentation, and you really feel the boost in strength when you craft and equip even one or two pieces of nice gear.\n+ Crafting food is actually fun: your group gets stat bonuses for each type of unique food they carry, up to 10 types, so you actually want to make that beef stew!\n+ “Research” in the game is accomplished primarily by CRAFTING useful items, and secondarily by performing quests. I appreciated such a unique mechanic.\n+ Long-term goal accomplishment. You have to play through the game multiple times to unlock everything.\n+ I personally enjoyed the “flavor” of the world, which includes rife “magical issues” and spirit/ demon presence to serve as choose your own adventure style choices\n\nBoth Positive and Negative:+/- While you can save and re-load the game at will, you can only re-load from your last save point, and no further back. This means you cannot easily un-do any early game inefficiencies. However, I actually ended up appreciating the mechanic- I could save before difficult points and re-load if my beloved characters died, yet I still felt the game was “live” and the re-load mechanism was natural. Note that after winning the game the first time through (which does not take terribly long), moving on to a new game necessitates ending your current play-through and moving on from your current party into a completely new game in order to access new un-locked content.\n\nNegatives:- The game encourages re-play and has a huge amount of re-playability built into it in the “game leveling” feature: however, I feel the amount of repeat content (limited new content) as you progress can make the game inevitably feel “grindy,” which may inhibit how much re-play actually occurs.\n- At times the story text can be written rather oddly. I actually really enjoy the colloquial nature of how the author wrote the texts, but certain grammar or wording errors stick out and affect the experience.\n- There are times when resource management becomes cumbersome. I found later game I was spending a good amount of my time just micro-managing food acquisition and item creation and assignment instead of adventuring.\n- At higher levels, facing lower level monsters can get repetitive. Fortunately the “auto contest” feature comes in handy for this. But after a while the player still feels a bit like “man, more spiders?”\n- I personally felt the game could use more basic resource types, since crafting and experimenting with recipes is such a core part of the game. (I recognize why they capped it though: research is required to unlock resource farmability, so they did it for game-mechanic purposes, but I still felt after a while I was yearning for new types of resources to be found.)\n- Because the game necessitates abandoning an older game to play as servants of a new god, it can be a bit of a bummer leaving an old tribe of well-established villagers to start over as a few rag-tag ill-equipped newbies\n\nThere are times when the game feels like a $20 game and not a $50 game. Well, it is a $20 game, and not a $50 game. But for the price, I got an unexpected amount of fun out of it.\n\nWho this game is for:People who like “choose your own adventure” style text reading, and who like resource management/ crafting games.\n\nWho this game is not for:People who don’t like to read text, people who want animations or high end graphics.\n\nOverall: 9/10. I highly recommend “Thea: The Awakening!”\n","November 29, 2015","true","16.3"," 54 of 55 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","54","55","0","0"

While not truly a 3X or 4X game, it has a lot going for it, and that is going to be the most easily made comparison in terms of how it feels and plays. Let's dive into more detail.\n\nGameplay:In Thea: The Awakening, you are a freshly awakened deity, powers diminished, desperately clinging to your hold to this world and your followers, so your goal is to lead your followers to victory and establish your place in the world once again. You start with a nice, simple tutorial to get you going with actual experiential learning, while the help text that will pop up along the way will provide more in-depth information on the mechanics involved. You start with a set amount of villagers, on a set difficulty, with two of the gods to pick from. Each god or godess has their own bonuses, which are unlocked through gaining experience in your campaigns with them.\n\nBoth movement and combat are turn-based, with movement being tile or hex-based, and combat being card-based. If you don't want to optimize your combat results, or deal with the tedium, you can have the game auto-resolve it for you. You can gather two materials at your village, a food and building material, and you can send an expedition party out to gather specific materials while camping. Materials enable you to construct, cook, and craft. Your expedition party is a major part of your progression, though, as they are primarily how you fight, loot, and encounter events...all of which can provide you with more advanced or rare materials. It doesn't end there, though! Villagers can also progress individually, gaining stats as they level up, and better equipment will only serve to augment this growth.\n\nThere are many ways in which you can choose to deal with the start of your game, as there are many options for gathering materials. When a child grows into a villager, you can choose what their specialty will be, and you can even pick a default focus for your village when starting the game. Of course, you are going to need some of everything to progress, but this game is still friendly to multiple playstyles. It is also possible to get through encounters without "fighting," which can offer greater rewards, and less risk to your adventurers.\nAs a Torment fan, all I can say is: awesome.\n\nMost of the options you choose to respond to an event with in Thea will involve combat, though, because you still have to 'battle' your way through sickness, social diplomacy, traps, sneak attempts, etc. The combat is tactical, card-based, and fun. You have two phases in which you place your cards in your most ideal order, left to right, and then two fight phases where damage is dealt in that order. You have plentiful options for how you want to go about doing this, from control, disable, buff, and debuff. At times this can be very fun, especially when an evenly matched enemy throws out a curveball or a good turn, and you have to respond well to get through it. At other times, you have a relatively strong party fighting a relatively weak party. Thankfully, you can auto-resolve the combat in these types of situations.\n\nThere is an impressively massive array of creatures, equipment, materials, events, points of interest, entertaining things to read, and options in this game; and all of it makes for a wildly engaging, fun, tactical experience, with a skillfully intertwined list of genres to keep anyone happy. RPG-esque turn-based combat and character progression? Check. Board-based strategy and settlement progression? Check. An almost choose-your-own adventure style event system? Check. An actually engaging story concept, lore, dialogue, and event writing? Check. Resource management and survival? Check. It even approaches being able to be labeled a god game.\n\nThea offers something for any number of genre fans to get absorbed in, and enjoy all the while.\n\nGraphics:Between the colors, map, models, textures & FX, smooth little animations, actually immersive painterly art, and a UI that is easy on the eyes, there's little to dislike here, and whether you will like it or not will be readily apparent from a few screenshots.\n\nAudio:Not only is it very good and fun, but I've yet to find the background music to get repetitive. Sound effects such as attacking or event notices are satisfying. Narration is not only nostalgic, but qualitative. There is also very little you could dislike here.\n\nConclusion:Unless you are an FPS, real-time combat, or action combat purist, this is a game that offers so much for such a small price. I can easily recommend it at full price. I would still recommend it at full price if it was 60 dollars.\n\n======================================If you like my reviews, you can easily keep up with them here.\n======================================","January 4","true","15.9"," 70 of 86 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","70","86","4","8"

The map looks like it plays as a 4X game, but movement across the world is about where the similarities end. The player never expands beyond their initial settlement. The settlement is more a base of operations. The villagers in the settlement craft tools, weapons and armor based on the resources that collect and recipes they unlock with research points. The research points are mostly gained by crafting, but also gained from the text adventures and battles encountered throughout the world. It's cool in this regard, because it feels like the learn by doing.\n\nThe player send out a party to collect more resources and find places of interest. The game can be won by following a series of quests. The card game used to resolve conflicts plays out fairly fast and is pretty fun. There are enough choices to give the player ample opportunities to affect the outcome.\n\nThe main problem is the user interface. There are several aspects that just require too much clicking around and switching screens. Crafting, checking the villagers equipment and assigning new items can get tedious. Also, it would help if there was a roster screen where the user could compare the skills of all of the villagers right from one screen.\n\nI like how the day / night cycle changes how the game plays out and makes the world a little more dangerous.\n\nIf players can overlook some UI problems they'll find a game that doesn't really feel like other strategy games out there.

You aren't trying to deal with unruly civ AI asking for peace then declaring war next turn. Almost the entire world is against you and that's just the way it is. You aren't trying to build the biggest army to steamroll your enemy. You're trying to keep a ragtag group alive and strong enough to hold back the darkness. It doesn't ask you to send colonists all over the map trying to found new cities to build your empire. It gives you a handful of people and one small village to protect- and protect is the key word.\n\nThe "combat" mechanic is a card game that takes each individual's skill and equipment and creates a series of either tactical actions or sends them into the front lines to fight, hopefully to be boosted by your tactical hand. And this is where the protect idea comes in. At first, the enemies are easy and automating the fight guarantees a win. But then you run up against your first three skull. Then four. Then five. You can't just automate everything, you have to actually play the game. Then you see just how easy it is to lose everything with a bad hand.\n\nThe characters are individuals each with their own strengths and weaknesses that need to be monitored and cared for. Each skill affects a variety of different types of card games: tactical, hunting, social, etc. These are all benefitted by different skills. A cadre of warriors is great until you run into a magic demon you can't just swing a sword at. You start to feel the loses when one person dies, carefully camping and hoping the medic does their job. Losing children from your village can set you back, leaving you outnumbered and overrun in a couple turns. The world feels like it's pressing in on your little band, and it makes sure you feel every hit.\n\nNow, the story? It's interesting. The actual main plot line is well-voiced and has a rather ecclectic cast. Creatures from Slavic mythology play a huge part in the events on Thea, most of that part being to bathe in your blood. It weaves a fascniating tale showing the downfall of your world and offers abundant morale choices leaving you to wonder if the world really should be reborn. Who knows. It's up to you. My only complaint is that the story, however good, is really only entertaining to listen to once or twice. By your fifth restart- and yes, you will restart that many times and more afterwards- it gets boring and you really just want to move it along. That being said, you won't always get the same side missions each playthrough. Some will appear in one play then never again. Many will appear multiple times in a single run. And all are more than worth it.\n\nFinally, there is the gods. You are cast in the role of one of the disenfranchised gods, hoping to spread just a little light on your poor followers and guide them in this world. Your experience and restarting matters though as each play collects experience that levels the god up to activate new bonuses for your next playthrough, greatly encouraging replaying the same god over just to get that next perk. Again, the complaint here is that experience is hard to come by and it can take a long time to get a level up depending on how hard you fight, what you research, and what your rarest item is, which can net you a hefty amount of points.\n\nThis game has my whole-hearted recommendation. If you love the idea of a card-combat game, 4X, or are just looking for something new to wet your whistle, this game with provide everything you need. Combat has a small learning curve, but, once you get it, it can easily become the best part of the game; micromanaging is simple and watching your little tribe of nothings grow into powerful warriors, craftsmen, and gatherers is rewarding and feels worth it; and watching the world of Thea open at your fingertips is astoundingly beautiful.","January 7","true","29.5"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","0"

Simple concept polished to a shine, updates are frequently every other day, bug-fixes are extremely quick, and the devs have released updates on Sunday more than once. :)\n\nNew features include:\n\n- as you explore the map, you can see unresearched resources that are next in line in your gathering tree BEFORE you've researched them, leading to more diversity in resources you use as you might unlock and use resources that are closer to your town rather than more powerful resources that are far away and thus inaccessible except for late game.\n\n- a new quality system, with three levels of quality: good, standard and bad. Good quality items are unlocked by having at least one blacksmith made from any resources, so it is often good to unlock and build the blacksmith early, even if it's just made from wood, and then upgrade it later for a higher crafting skill bonus.\n\n- standard quality is the regular item as all items used to be before the quality system.\n\n- a good quality item has 120% (20% more) of the standard quality's numerical stat values, rounded to the nearest whole number, and also weighs less.  You can increase the chance of crafting a good quality item (after passing the low quality check, which is easier with higher craft skill) by using a better catalyst, up to a maximum of 15%.\n\n- a bad quality item, chance of crafting these is minimized by having a high crafting skill on your lead crafter when the product is finished (minimum chance of crafting bad quality is 1%), has 70% (30% less) of the standard quality's numerical stat values, rounded to the nearest whole number, and also weighs more.  However for items that have standard quality giving +1 to stat/s, there is no difference apart from weight and the "Bad Quality" tag.\n\n- loot can also have good, standard and bad quality too, making it actually useful when you get good quality items, though bad quality loot items, like bad quality items you craft, still often get dismantled for resources (but check, it may be that apart from a weight difference it still provides all or much the same stats if the standard quality only gives minor stat bonuses).\n\n- new Bloodbath mode, worth an extra 50% difficulty (new maximum 350%) where if your units get overkilled (take more damage than they have health) they can be at extra chance of dying by having received more wounds than health from fight challenges (overkill is prevented when Bloodbath is off, although there are other ways in the normal game to have more wounds than health).\n\nSo if your rat or low health unit gets whacked for 60 damage, it's not going to come back unless you can reach and fulfill the requirements for the Herbalist Hut wound healing that same turn, or are lucky enough to get a wound healing event that same turn. :)\n\n- and of course the new Giants content, which includes many new non-Giants themed random events. There are now so many random events that every game is truly different, and even with frequently appearing events (such as the herb-picking spider nest encounter), different resources are given as rewards each time, making a big difference in what you craft on higher difficulties.\n\nThis new content also includes full English voiceovers and text localization into French, German, Polish and Russian with the ability to create custom text localizations as well.  The voiceovers and text localization are for the whole game, not just the new stuff.\n\n- that's not to mention the event editor, which allows users to create their own events and share them with others on MuHa Games' website. The editor is powerful and great tutorials and support are provided. This will be fantastic for the longetivity of Thea, even without new stuff added by the devs.\n\nBest $20 I've ever spent. The devs are in my opinion the most competent, hard-working and responsive devs I have EVER met, and they're extremely friendly and consider community members frequently, and fit things into the game with all of their love of their baby, Thea: The Awakening. :)","May 4","true","628.6"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","4"

New games start with a choice of god, each having alternate stats and abilities which level-up further through playing, new god options also unlock for future rounds. Several map sizes can be chosen, along with selecting a primary village focus. Tutorial walks through the basics which involves setting up towns for harvesting and crafting while the expedition squad starts exploring for treasure and subquests. Squads can be geared up with the loot found and forged. Battles involved the CCG mentioned, which was rather in-depth. Don't enjoy cards? Able to automate battles which speeds things along and allows focus on the rpg elements.\n\nLots of random events happen, I'm sure some are tied to time of day and seasonal changes. Decent looking game overall. Based on the unity engine it supports 4k+ screen resolutions and the standard range of quality settings. No options were available in-game at the moment. Controls were mouse driven, no complaints with the user interface. Laid out well and fonts all readable at higher resolutions, which included quest text (huge plus). Probably the biggest downside is the inital load time, once you are in-game they are not a problem so it's just the nature of the beast/genre.\n\nWill update/edit my recommendation later, hopefully still helps.

With events and quests that will help immerse you and a refreshing slavic mythology to break up the constant western mythology everywhere.\n\nYou are in control of a small group of survivors who need to brave the hostile world and survive and for this you get a very detailed, in-depth control over them all. Every piece of equipment can be custom-made within certain limits provided you have the materials to do so, and you can manage the equipment of all your warriors, your workers, and everyone else in town too. Of course, this can get overwhelming and the interface may appear cluttered at a time (Tip: If it is, uncheck 'equipped' to not show equipped items in the item list), but that is a small price to pay for the function of being able to customise everyone to your liking. You do not settle any more villages, instead sending out expeditions to gather resources and bring them back home. These expeditions can stay out as long as they have food to stay out safely to ultimately can bring back treasures and resources, clear out monster nests, or work on quests.\n\nYou gain experience and technology through quests and fighting, so it is a good idea to keep going around to find more with your expeditions, but at the same time you will need to balance the need for tech points with the need for resources. It gets fairly complex, and with a large amount of resources there are a massive amount of options for your strategies to lead to victory or defeat. This comes with a few issues as well, namely things you can find or do that are just not as good as others, or the unlocking of a resource that is not anywhere near you to gather. With limited tech points to spend on these, you will need to be sure of what you want and then plan around getting it, preferably with a contingency plan, or you will end up directionless, with random equipment looted from the enemies, and no real battle plan. And this takes some knowledge of the game before you can be reasonably expected to do well at it.\n\nCombat, and any other challenge is done through a cardgame. At first it is a difficult and complex one, but with practise it quickly becomes clear how it works and what ability is a good idea to use when. There is a button to skip it if you just can't wrap your head around it, and it will automate it for you behind the scenes, which I have found to be a blessing when something trivial attacks you, or when you're just not feeling up for it at the moment.\n\nNot all is great though, balance is a bit difficult to find, with some weapons being flat out better than others, and nearly all non-human characters just plain being better than your human survivors. As well as some resources just plain being inferior to others, while yet others still are so incredibly good that a deposit nearby your settlement will almost guarrantee you'll win. It can use some work, but it's not too big of a deal and doesn't hurt your experience too much.\n\nWith a large amount of events - Many of which I've not even seen after 17 hours of play, Thea: The Awakening is going to keep you busy for hours, and even though it may have its flaws, its strong points and the detailed events of slavic mythologic origin by far outweigh them and make it a very worthwhile game to play","November 23, 2015","true","19.5"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","37","42","0","0"

Essentially, your community is alone in the world and you have to delve out into the hostile world to progress your party and community.  If you don't the world will sooner than later come calling in ever more powerful groups and your "life" will end - so, you really have to go out and explore; and collect resources; craft many, many items - and survive long enough to finish the story quest; or become powerful enough to dominate the entire "world" - both very, very difficult on the hardest setting.  HUGE replay value, as each adventure is different; each encounter different; as each party is different and encounters situations differently.  The battle system is very tactical; the resources you collect and when you collect them; and what advancements those allow is very strategic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jagermaestro/recommended/378720/","jagermaestro","Jagermaestro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jagermaestro/","350 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSummary:\nThis game wants to be good, but it isn't.  With less than 2 months before their stated go live, there is way too much work left to make this a quality game.  It’s not just bugs holding this game back.\n\nPros:\n-It's quirky somewhat non-trope fantasy setting is engaging.\n-It's concept is something sorely under attempted in games today, there is very little like it.\n-There is a decent amount of freedom given to the player to do what they want.\n-The drawn art on the cards is very good.\n\nCons:\n-The color art is mediocre.\n-The game is not difficult, it’s just throws total nonsense at you.  After experiencing a run through, and now knowing what to expect, the difficulty is trivial.  Surprising the player with ridiculous power spikes to perma kill party members is not "difficult", it’s just bad game design.\n-The game mistakes difficulty for punishment.  It punishes you for not knowing what to expect, making it frustrating, unenjoyable, and stifling your desire to explore.  It tries to make up for this by putting some persistence in through leveling up gods (this civ like games version of civs, because you will never feel like a god, and rarely does it ever present this story from the gods point of view), making it seem ok to either fail or get frustrated and quit because "hey you leveled up some meaningless stat boosts and perhaps unlocked a new uninspiring god!".  The persistence is a waste of time, and in a game that requires so much grinding and takes so long to play through, it just doesn't work to keep you coming back.\n- 4000 supposed items, of which about 10 are useful.  Only 5 resources seem to matter at all (dragon bone, mithril, moonstone, diamond and maybe ancient wood).  Most weapons and armor are trash that you will only see looted off of corpses.  Most buildings (of the 9 possible) are too expensive to bother with and offer too little bonus.  Your settlement will probably consist of walls and barracks and nothing more.  Buildings which recruit the more exotic creatures are a waste of time, as these creatures offer little benefit over humans and require huge investments of resources.  Goblins are somewhat useful, but demons and animals are total jokes.  The difficulty of getting orcs is so high that you are unlikely to get one before your initial humans are all powerhouses beyond that new orcs functionality. Buildings also don't show stats, which I assume will be addressed prior to launch.  It would also be nice to have a town summary.\n- The story is not that interesting or well written. It’s rife with poor grammar, sentence structure, immersion killing attempts at humor and sigh inducing responses even when things do get serious.  Kudos for having some story I suppose, but at least get someone to proof read it. The two story lines don't even mesh properly.\n- What should be an intimate story of a group of villagers surviving in the wastes ends up being a mass of repeated character art and names, partially forced on you by the ridiculous spikes in difficulty and the brutal setback of risking losing a character that has been with you from the beginning.  The game performance suffers after a certain number of characters are present in a group during battles.\n- The setback of losing a character inspires pedantic, hyper-anal gameplay.  This is counter to the style of the game and to turn based strategy in general.  The speed at which they die once suffering a wound, or completely heal, makes items like the medicine hut building (forgot the proper name as its useless) or map location herbalist hut nearly completely useless.  Perhaps allowing for some time to move your party to a location before losing the character might make these things more beneficial and kill off this horrible mechanic.\n- While the monsters stats are somewhat random, battle composition is not.   You will fight the same 2-3 sets of monsters during each phase of gameplay over and over.  Auto-battle is ridiculously bad, forcing you to fight rats and bees well into the game to avoid wounds which could cause a character to die.  Even later, while having a party able to auto dragons, you may just spontaneously take enough damage to a character to lose them.  The game already throws way to much boring repetitive combat at you, no need to force me to execute the same boring strategy over and over to take 0 damage from anything.  Perhaps note the number of times a player beats a fight and then allow them to skip fights they ace 3 or 4 times in a row would alleviate the need to smarten the auto battle and negate the tedium.\n- Dragons don't drop dragon skin or bones.  If you are going to throw 8 million of them at me, feel free to at least have them reward give some reward.\n- Food is little more than an inconvenience.  I have enough to feed my people for eons, but nothing else to build worth building.  Trash loot accumulates in the same way.\n- Catalyst is a pointless step in the ingredient chain, and using higher level catalysts do nothing.\n- Normal card combat is at least well thought out initially (though broken with larger party sizes, and far too tedious).  All other challenges are a complete waste of time, offer no difficulty and are an auto battle success 100% of the time.  Assassination is ridiculous, why not just make it an auto success?  Tactics seemed like it was going to be good (higher HP and lower damage), but never fleshed out (need to add more challenge here and perhaps increase the rounds in a tactics fight so card order matters more).\n\nConclusion:\nUltimately, this game needs a ton of work, far more than the 2 remaining months of development allow.  More decisions need to be available in the running of your society and less reliance on quantity of troops needs to be made.  Crafters are nearly useless as you won't be crafting enough to need more than 2 or 3.  Town customization needs to be made more exciting and rewarding. Narrative needs improvement, and the way the game goes about being difficult needs to be rethought.  I am surprised and disappointed by the lack of criticism in the current reviews of this game.\nI put in the hours before I wrote this specifically to have full understanding of the game before I went in with this.","October 9, 2015","false","74.7"," 145 of 223 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","145","223","5","19"

Why not 4X you ask? Because it only has the eXplore, eXploit and eXterminate parts. There is a very small part of eXpand in that you build up your main settlement and attract new villagers, but you are restricted to one village and can't expand its borders like in for instance Civilization or Age of Wonders.\n\nYou play as a re-awakened god or goddess in the world of Thea, which is just recovering from an era of utter darkness. Your goal is to help the few people who still kept their faith in you survive and rebuild what they've lost while also trying to figure out what happened in the world that caused this darkness.\n\nAt the beginning, the game seems pretty restricted and simple because of the missing of the 4th X: You build weapons, armor and buildings with the materials that your expedition brings home, which in turn generates research which unlocks new materials, buildings and crafting recipes.\n\nHowever, after you horribly fail the first few attempts, you start to notice how deep the game actually is. Do you want one large expeditionary force or multiple smaller ones? If you bring along a lot of gatherers in your expeditions, you can rapidly collect that valuable steel, but your wood and vegetable production in your village will suffer.\n\nThe game is also very clever in the way it handles conflicts. Most conflicts can be resolved in a number of ways depending on your expedition composition. You can not only fight a pack of wolves traditionally, but you can also opt to hunt them if you've got a few people with the proper hunting skillset. If you have a few intelligent people with herbalism and medicine skills, you can choose to just set traps for the wolves with poisoned meat.\n\nThese conflicts (named Challenges by the game) are all played out using a card game that is part luck and part skill. I'd say it is more skill-based than Hearthstone for instance.\nThe cards are the people in your expedition (or village, if it's under attack) and the stats and abilities on those cards are determined by the type of encounter.\n\nDuring fights, the Damage statistic (which is mostly determined by strenght and the damage of your equipped weapon) will determine, you've guessed it, the amount of damage a card can do. However, during social challenges, damage is determined by the character's Speech skill. That beefy warrior with the giant two-handed axe can suddenly be completely useless if you're trying to convince a group of slave traders to let go of their cargo.\n\nIt's a very interesting system and it makes party composition extremely important, as you never know what's around the corner.\n\nWhen you (inevitably) meet your demise, you are awarded a score based on all that you've done and the difficulty modifier. This score is then added to the experience of the god you've used, unlocking extra passive abilities. When any god reaches level 3, you will unlock a new god with a different playstyle. I enjoy this system, it gives a sense of progression and although the gods' abilities seem subtle at first, they have quite an impact on the way you play.\n\nAdditional things that I like are the art style used (the cards are very pretty), the music and the setting. You will encounter very unusual creatures that you may sometimes recognise from the Witcher series, as both games take inspiration from the same mythology.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game, it's a lot of bang for your buck. And you will think about what you did wrong that cost you that precious Crafter's life long after you've shut down the game.","November 24, 2015","true","60.0"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","0"

Crafting system. You unlock a type of weapon, tool, armor etc to make. But each type can have a lot of variations based on what materials you use to make it. Materials give them unique properties, such as life-leech, +defenses +stats, and for weapons, rarer metals like mythril boost its raw damage.\n\nWhy this is so cool is that its up to you what kind of things you craft, there's no set recipes like "Hunter Sword" requiring a set mat, sometimes you make something inferior just because its the materials you have available and you need that weapon NOW for an un-armed villager.\n\nOr, you can choose to wait and hope your adventuring finds more rarer mats to have enough to make that epic weapon. It's dynamic, its got depth, it offers choices.\n\nThe research tree is small & at first glance, looks to be over-simplified. But this is a GOOD thing, because there's a ton of depth underneath it. This is great design not to overwhelm but to ease players into it, once they understand the quirks they can really go to town on what to craft.\n\n2. Combat. What this game does with a bunch of simplistically drawn cards without attack or defend animations, far surpasses most tactical games in terms of offering tactical depth. Instead of elaborate level design, awesome animations, uber 3d models/textures, this is pure un-adulterated GAMEPLAY trumping all of that.\n\nIt's turn based, you play cards, how you play and position them along with using tactical card abilities give a lot of flexibility during tough encounters. Your cards represent your people, of whom you can level up and equip with all the cool things you craft or loot that affect their stats and abilities.\n\nStats do matter, however, a good tactical play can get your weaker squad to beat a superior foe, which is what every strategy game should aspire to. It shouldn't be stats > all and in Thea, it is not, thankfully.\n\nI thought it was great going 1h sword + shield for my squad, since shields offer a regenerating defense that absorbs damage, it felt like an imbalance that favors this playstyle.. but nope. I soon ran into enemies that have leech attacks or magic that bypasses shields and my 1 hand weapon lacks the damage to kill them quickly before they pwned my squad.\n\nThis is where a balance squad with punchy 2handers backed up by tanks is required. Good balance is a measure of how different weapon or tactical play all have a niche where they excel and none is left feeling "gimped" by design. In Thea, there's great combat balance.\n\nAs an aspiring solo gamedev myself, these two key features leave me with a new-found appreciation of how effective simplistic game design can be yet still retain and ooze depth.\n\nAt the end of the day, as a gamer, I appreciate gameplay over flashy graphics and its not to say this game is un-attractive (some UI polish is needed, given indie & small dev-team), it has a nice aesthetics to it, but here, gameplay is just top-notch with more depth than most games I've played in this genre.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIf you're still not convinced to buy this game, allow me to expand with 2 more points why this game is just so great:\n\n3. The game can be very brutal like most rogue-likes. The random nature of it all can wreck havok on your playthrough. However, the devs have really thought it out well and offer customizable difficulty options which are quite vast beyond "Easy, Normal, Hard", with individual metrics that can be tweaked to your liking. So novices can enjoy it without feeling hopeless and veterans can really tweak the difficulty to give them a challenge.\n\n4. Character options are just vast, with many different races, monsters, demons to recruit through a unique village upgrade mechanic. When you build structures, depending on the materials used, you gain a small percent chance to attract adventurers or beasts to join your village.\n\nThis is a highly fun and flexible system since it allows very different play-styles. Example, you could focus on being a Beastlord..  build structures with Monster Bones and not long you will have a horde of beasts in your army, such as Bears (maul is OP), Vipers, Snakes, Bats, etc. The good thing? Beasts don't need gear, they come buffed already, so you save a ton of materials on crafting! Or go for a full Elven, Dwarven, Orc, Goblin or even Demons & Vampires..\n\nDid I mention this game has depth?\n\nBEST 4X in a LONG TIME.\n\nps. Whoever came up with the card combat mechanic deserves a cold beer, cos its just outstanding gameplay while requiring minimal time/$/resource investment to implement. 2D non-animated cards offering so much fun and deep gameplay over 3d models with realistic terrain destruction physx?? Say it ain't so! :D","November 21, 2015","true","33.9"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","35","41","2","3"

I love so many things about this game -- let me list them (while trying to keep superlatives to a minimum):\n\n1. They broke out of the vaguely-western-European-medieval fantasy setting. Thank Nyarlathotep for that!\n\n2. DEEP crafting system. I'm a loot hound so this really appeals to me.\n\n3. Insanely detailed character stats, which leads to\n\n4. MANY WAYS of overcoming challenges! Tired of your 2-hp wizard getting KOed by a kobold? In Thea, you can tackle enemies head-on in a brawl OR using a wide variety of other skillsets: tactical, social, magical, physical, mental... Often you get the chance to choose from 2+ challenge types. So you know what? You can create a party of specialists who can go out and kick a** on their OWN TERMS!\n\n5. There's an interesting research tree. Brushy (lots of paths) rather than deep (usually limited to 2 levels, rarely 3).\n\n6. The writing's pretty good -- which surprised me, considering how much other reviews grief on it. Yes, there are some odd anachronisms but nothing that made me suspend my disbelief.\n\n7. Card-based tactical combat! Hearthstone it ain't, but there's sufficient depth that fights can get pretty thinky. Especially when you're overmatched.\n\nNegatives:\n\n1. I really resent the single-settlement limitation. Maybe for Xmas we can get the opportunity to set up a second settlement -- just make it have INSANE levels of input (like 1k wood, 500 stone, 15k food...)\n\n2. Random events WILL kill your characters. It's gonna happen. Don't ragequit. This isn't an RPG. Sack up. And this leads us to...\n\n3. Additional characters seem VERY hard to come by. I'm 80 hours into a normal-difficulty game and I have MAYBE 16 people (and a wolf). Now, this fits with the whole humanity-on-the-brink-of-extinction motif, but I feel constrained in my exploration of the different classes and character types. So get this: people are your most critical resource! Plan accordingly.\n\n4. Map sprawl: resource-gathering teams have to go a LOOOOOOONG way to get a few key materials. That's reasonable but I really don't like spending 5 or so turns just hitting the "End Turn" button.\n\n5. No directions/instructions. Like, virtually nothing. So if you aren't willing to figure it out on your own, wait a bit and hope the devs hire a copywriter.\n\nALL IN ALL -- this is the best game I've played since Fallout 3. Enjoying it like crazy (writing this on 3.5 hours of sleep because of this darn game...)","December 3, 2015","true","156.7"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","27","28","2","1"

I backed it on Kickstarter, it failed and I thought "Oh well, that's that." I didn't even have that much of an investment into it on Kickstarter. I was like "Ehh, cheap, looks vaguely amusing."\n\nHowever, it's a freaking gem. I don't know exactly how, it just seems to do everything right. I've played similar (in elements) games  before, like Fallen Enchantress et al but I've found them merely competent rather than engaging.\n\nThere's a very RPG feel to your expeditions that doesn't exist in other titles. It's less of a 4X game and more of a party RPG. You're equipping your characters and they have NAMES. You get to know that Luba is a great combatant and you have her slug it out with the tough stuff after loading her up with your best armour and weapons, but when there's sneaking to be done, you leave it to Jasia. Zlatina's who you call when you want a hunter and when you want a diplomat, you'll want to pull Vladymir from the forge to join your expedition.\n\nI absolutely refuse to have any of my people die. I've worked out the card-based combat system (which is used for any "combat", whether it's social, physical, sneaking or intellectual) which does take a bit of getting used to where I'm letting my tanks soak up the damage and my rogues and hunters smash through enemy defenses.\n\nHonestly, if any of the aspects I mentioned appeal to you, give it a try, especially while it's on special.

On the surface, it has all of the elements to be an amazing game that would be right up my alley: it has that nice blend of strategy and role-playing elements in an interesting fantasy setting. The idea of guiding a village to survive in a world that was consumed by darkness is a compelling one. The problem is, unfortunately, in the details.\n\nThea has a very strong reliance on "fake difficulty" mechanics. For the uninitiated, "fake difficulty" is when a game's difficulty relies on aspects beyond player skill. In Thea's case, the game relies heavily on a combination of heavy randomness and trial-and-error gameplay in order to provide a challenge to the player.\n\nThe game often obfuscates what is needed to succeed at any particular quest until the last minute. At the same time, you can take the same path through the same quest over multiple playthroughs and end up with wildly varying results, sometimes even suffering character deaths after resounding successes in the challenge itself. This makes it sound like your best path to success is to have a wide and diverse party, but the randomness of the game stifles this line of thinking. A battle or other challenge will have your characters randomly distributed between active and support roles, and it is not uncommon for diverse teams to have a battle start with their craftsmen occupying the majority of the front line while the brawny warriors are in the back.\n\nNote that the problem is not that the game is too difficult: in fact, in many ways it is easy. The problem is that the game is too reliant on its randomness, its obfuscation, and its enforced "ironman mode" (all of your actions are saved and you can't reload to any point before the last autosave) to provide a modicum of challenge. Randomness is a necessary thing in games, but in a game without a proper save/load function, where a single catastrophic failure can result in the loss of a game you've spent hours into, it can also kill it. Never while playing Thea do I feel like my strategic skills are being challenged, and that's a problem in a game that's supposed to be part strategy.\n\nIt's a crying shame, too, as there's a great game in there. Thea would be something to recommend to those who enjoy collectable card games or other games which rely very heavily on the luck of the draw. As an actual RPG or strategy game, though, I'm afraid I have to give this a thumbs down, since all I could feel at the end of the day was how much of a shame it is that a great premise was ruined by its execution.","October 3, 2015","false","29.9"," 111 of 171 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","111","171","2","23"

One really easy way to do this would be to present the player with 3 skills to choose from on each individual when leveling up. Then you still have some "randomness" but you can pick the one of the three skills you feel best describe the individual and it's progress. It would give each charachter a more unique feel and you would feel you are part of the individuals development(all rpg like:-). Or at least make it a toggle option that effects the "difficult" percentage when creating a new game(I would leave it on everytime :-). Or make it a difficult scale. Hardest/highest difficult percentage as it is now, no control of what skill gained. Second hardest/second highest difficult percentage choose between 2 random skills pick the one you feel best describe the individual. Easiest/lowest difficult percentage(or zero) choose between 3 random skills.\n\nAbove would make this game even more fantastic(better yet would be individual experience for every character and individual level up but that could maybe be to hard to implement so I'd settle for the above).\n\nOther then that I really like it so far.

Already beat it once after various playthroughs.\n\nThe game is well developed so far, you advance your village through resource gathering, crafting and a few types of buildings to construct.\nThis is mainly done through the research portion of the game that allows you to unlock new resources in the map or the different craft options. Research (and experience) is gained through the completion of quests, events or fights. With experience you level up your villagers wich gain a point or two in some of the many skills they could have and that depends too on the type of villager.\n\nThe combat is very innovative in my experience as it uses a card system where each turn each player uses its party members in either a straight forward attack unit or to activate a special ability that relates to their earned skills. Each type of challenge (Fight, social, magic, etc) resolves using this mechanism and is really enjoyable.\n\nTo even add to that, the games events and quests are very interesting and tell a grand tale of the world as it was and as it is and many will change depending the God that aids you.\n\nThe Gods are another unique and interesting thing, as you play and win or lose you accumulate experience points for the God that you chose at the start of the game and which will add several passive upgrades to your villagers and village and which change significantly the way you play the game.\n\nFor the early access part of the game: It shows that it is in development, there are parts that need to have greather deep, UI upgrades, more options and so, but it really shines, even now.\n\nIf you want a 4X-lite game with and interesting combat mechanism and resource gathering, DO BUY!.\n","October 22, 2015","true","44.8"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","2"

You craft because the fighting is so fun, you fight because the exploring is so fun, you explore because the looting in this game is so fun, you loot because the crafting is so fun, you craft because the fighting is so fun, and you did that whole cycle because advancing the story and raising a group of survivors into a hardened army is so fun. Many far greater budget games with far greater hype only manage to make one or two of their systems truly great, while the rest of the game act strictly as support. This is not the case with Thea.\n\nSo what is Thea? Thea is a strategy game where you attempt to guide a ragtag band of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. At first, you will be trying to stabilize your situation with enough food and fuel to not starve. Later, you will explore the world to attempt to find better ingredients to craft into ever-better gear. As time goes on, enemies get fiercer and quests get harder,but you are racing against that with your own technological development.\n\nThe best part of Thea is that you are never playing the game on auto-pilot. The combat system is *excellent*. It is never easy to figure out a best way to equip your party, but it is apparent you need a mix of specialties. When you're sitting at the card game, looking at the board in a close battle, it is always apparent you need to do something crafty... but it's rarely apparent whether you'd want to be crafty by putting down a big, well-shielded blocker, confusing an enemy to stall its turn, or go on the offense. Everything matters in the card-based minigame - how your hand is dealt, when you play your cards, which cards you play and hold, and what stat you play your cards for. Even hours and hours through this game, after I've played and replayed sections, I'm still finding myself putting down a bigt 2-handed hammer fighter against spiders, only to have him caught out without a shield for the Spider Queen's attack because the computer played its tactisc in a way I never expected.\n\nAll that said, Thea does have some flaws that bear mentioning, All 3D models in this game come from Unity... which means all the characters are disgustingly ugly and generic. Fortunately, there are not very many 3D models of characters, and you don't have to look at them very closely. Battles are played with drawn cards, and special events have a 2D picture. The question, of course, is why have the 3D models at all if the game's 2D is so much more beautiful than the 3D. The overworld map could've easily been purged of the ugly 3D Unity models with some clever abstract represenation in 2D.\n\nThe writing is also flawed at various points. The dialogue of the game is tone deaf. Here it is, trying to tell me an epic story of heroism, betrayal, monsters, and gods, but the language of the dialogue makes everyone sound like a modern teenager trying his best to simulate wit. This pulls me out of the epic storyline every time I reach the dialogue box.\n\nStill, good game? Yes. Would I recommend? Definitely. Will this drain hours and hours of your life? It should.","November 22, 2015","true","124.8"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","25","30","0","1"

Interesting in a way games like Planescape Torment or Sunless Sea are (although the quality of writing in Thea may not be quite on par with those two). The fantasy post-apocalyptic setting, based on slavic mythology, is intriguing. The world feels strange and hostile, learning it's workings is engaging.\nThe gameplay blends 4X strategy (well, 3X really, you won't be expanding beyond your village in Thea), Choose Your Own Adventure gamebook style events, branching story with multiple endings (you can ignore the story altogether though, and win by achieving set strategic goals), crafting, rpg-like gearing, and card-based challenges. Oh my, what a surprisingly well put together mix!\nCard combat is probably the weakest part of the game. Though it requires some degree of tactical thinking, ultimately it becomes a chore, except the most challenging encounters. Hopefully auto-resolve feature is entirely adequate. Another bugbear is that the game may sometimes feel grindy, leveling/unlocking gods in particular may've been faster.\nInspired by games ranging from King of Dragon Pass to Witcher, Thea's most important influence may be Civilization: it absolutely retains the "one more turn" feel to it.\n\nOh and kids are a resource in this game. You can use them to lure spooky monsters into traps, rescue cats, trade spare children to orcs or just throw them away, if you so desire. Best parenting experience possible.","December 7, 2015","true","17.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","19","20","6","0"

The developers - a tiny indie English-Polish team - have come up with very original and addictive gameplay that combines survival, 4X and RPG genres to create something pretty spectacular.\n\nThere is an huge amount of strategic and tactical complexity to the game. While you start with simple goals of surviving, you will soon be preoccupied with setting your villagers to work on various projects as you send off parties to scavange for resources to develop and defend your village. You will unlock new crafting materials to build up your tools and weapons, while confronting increasingly difficult roaming monsters and other challenges. As you explore the surrounding area, the backdrop of Slavic mythology provides a immersive narrative to the whole gameplay through encounters and random events that occur.\n\nThe card-based battles are good fun - they unfold in a logic way which allows for plenty of thinking to look for ways to defeat your enemies through clever use of tactics (the same system is also used to resolve various other non-violent challenges). It has all the 'feel' of a Heroes of Might and Magic battle.\n\nThe UI is intuative and the tutorials straightforward - it is easy to jump straight in, especially if you are familiar with Civ-style 4X games.  The Early Access status of this game doesn't detract at all. I encountered only a couple of minor bugs after 8 hours of play (eg. sometimes the music enters an endless loop). I consider it to be much more complete and bug free than many major games on full release. Thea is very reasonably priced for what it is. I know that I'll be playing it for a long time to come, and that so far I have only scratched the surface of this brilliant game.","September 30, 2015","true","47.7"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

There is a solid role-playing theme that is kept throughout the game.  The game, itself, is a rather challenging survival-civ-role playing game.  The music is excellent.\n\nEven if you have no interest in the chosen theme - the gameplay, itself, has a considerable amount of depth.  You don't have a "population" so much as you have a "party."  Each member of the party can be thought of as a sort of RPG character who can be equipped and improve attributes along the way.  This makes the survival element of the game, honestly.  There is a sense of loss when a character dies (and get used to that happening) - yet, it is not the end of the party's struggle.\n\nCombat can be settled via an auto-resolve function (which seems to be somewhat fair) or through a sort of card game.  The card game is not too difficult to understand, but does have some strategies and counter-strategies to give it some depth.  I get the sense that more challenging events are better to play out within the card game than to auto-resolve, though that is a limited sample size and highly subjective in its analysis.\n\nThe RPG aspect of the game has an interesting array of branching that allow for conflicts to be resolved through various challenges.  Stats aside from the typical fighting ones do matter quite a bit.\n\nHonestly, I hope the current level of difficulty remains.  There is something endearing about a game that doesn't pull many punches and will rake you over the coals.  There is something iconic about having an expedition take a hard hit from a random challenge encounter, then get swarmed by packs of tier three and four mobs in the night as they are effectively pinned and helpless, forced to abandon gear/supplies they can't carry if they manage to survive.\n\nWell, then there was also the time the harvest moon celebration killed my whole village.  I'm still not quite sure what happened, there.  I'm not sure they ever did, either.\n\nAll in all - this game has been an enjoyable investment of both time and money that does not seem to be anywhere close to ceasing to satisfy.","October 28, 2015","true","102.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","1"

So if you like at least one or two of them you shouldnt miss Thea, since its very well worth its price.\n\nAnother thing to mention is the very cool artwork and storytelling. I realy like what the artists have done here. It lets you immerse into the world quite easily, if you are not afraid of reading that is. The dark and interesting lore of Thea has some "The Witcher" familiarity, since both games are inspired by the east european/slawic folklore.\n\nFrom a technical point of view Thea is very solid. You can tell that the game went through early access and i didnt encounter any bugs until now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iharlequin/recommended/378720/","iharlequin","арлекин","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iharlequin/","473 products in account","Disclosure: Thea: The Awakening was played on retail code provided by the developer.\nYou can read the review with images and captions at Vox Ludicus[voxludicus.wordpress.com].\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Thea, you play the role of a god stripped of its divinity, a once powerful being now relegated to dominion over a dozen villagers. Your objective is to restore yourself to power and remove Thea from the somber period it is now in, just awoken from an era of darkness. Drawing elements from 4X, trading card games and roguelikes, the main question I asked myself when I first started playing was how these elements would come together. Twenty hours later, I have a verdict.\n\nAs you start the game you are immediately greeted with the choice of one out of eight different deities, of which only two are initially unlocked. The game has a progression system where you can level up and unlock new bonuses and traits for each god as you play with them, as well as other members from the pantheon. The tiers you unlock with each deity grant you lore-appropriate bonuses: Horos, Lord of the Night and Master of the Moon, grants boons to his followers that allow them to perform better during the night and in stealthy tasks; while Mokosh, Mother Earth, facilitates the gathering of resources and food for her followers.\n\nEach new run features a unique landscape, with your village having access to random types and amounts of resources. The game is, essentially, divided into two distinct parts: managing your village and your expedition(s). While you can scavenge resources and treasure with your expeditions, by camping and gathering on the map or acquiring it via events and battles, your village will be responsible for the steady income of fuel and food. It is a functional hub, where you can bring the resources and items your expeditions find for storage or use in crafting and construction.\n\nThe crafting system is elaborate and tied-in with another strategic element: research. As you complete events and battles you gain advancement points and experience points – while the latter will improve your villagers, advancement points allow you to unlock new buildings, different types of craftable items and “discover” new resources, which then show on your map and are subject to gathering by your expeditions. These advanced materials yield better crafted and constructed objects: a pasture that is built with simple components yields less meat than one constructed on materials that are further down the research tree.\n\nYour expeditions will handle the exploratory part of the 4X (which is actually 3X, as you can’t grow your village) and are a compromise between the usual exploration in 4X strategy games and Thea’s survival and roguelike elements. You can only walk over a small amount of tiles in a single turn, and each turn consumes your party’s food – which when varied and plentiful also offers bonuses to their attributes. The fog of war is dictated by a day/night cycle, as is monster behavior – you can expect added aggression during the night, be it directed at your expedition or your settlement. Completing quests and battles grants you a global amount of experience, which then levels up your villagers – in the settlement or expedition – assigning them random attributes according to their designation (Warrior, Gatherer, Craftsman, etc.).\n\nCombat is where the card aspect of the game comes into play. Before you draw any wrong conclusions, you don’t collect cards or build a deck – they are merely a representation of your villagers. Combat itself can take on many forms, some of them not necessarily lethal: your social interactions, such as trying to convince or intimidate someone, will be played in the same way as your fights, debates, physical tasks et. al., each time tapping into different attributes of your characters and setting them as the primary offensive and defensive attributes. While you can’t necessarily solve every conflict with a debate or in a sneaky manner, most quests have multiple solutions that you can choose according to how you’re role-playing or the strengths of your party: the Orc warrior that joined your group might make for poor conversation, but in turn the social interaction will allow your silver-tongued medic to shine.\n\nThe game’s setting immediately struck me as unique: inspired by both Slavic mythology and Tolkien-esque fantasy literature, you are as likely to meet an Orc chieftain as you traverse Thea as you are Baba Yaga or a Striga. The lore is well crafted and throughout the several pages of dialogue and interactions I had with the most varied creatures – benign (and malign) demons, dragons, witches and elves – the attention to detail from the Polish developers was evident.\n\nEvents are more or less independent from one another, though there are specific event chains – the main quest in particular – that can last throughout your entire playthrough. While some seem to appear with a certain frequency early on, for the most part the discovery of events and quests, much like the game’s geography and your party members, is procedurally generated. Your group’s attributes – of which there are dozens – and your previous actions will often unlock additional conversation/interaction options and allow you to solve quests in varied manners, allowing even repeated quests to have unexpected outcomes.\n\nNow is where I apologize for the overly descriptive review and explain what I intended with it. If it hasn’t become clear from what you read, the different systems in Thea – the exploration, the village management, the crafting, the research system and the combat – do not only come together in a cohesive manner, with purpose and intent, but are introduced in the game in elaborate and developed ways. None of these mechanics feel unnecessary or shoehorned, and even less so do they look like side-thoughts or are they casually implemented.\n\nThat’s not to say Thea doesn’t have its share of flaws. The UI takes a while to get acquainted with; the difficulty isn’t forgiving, and I died several times before making decent progress into the main quest; the fact that your character can strike out at two different enemies – the closest to his left or to his right – adds an unwelcome element of surprise in a game that otherwise downplays RNG in favor of strategy; and it doesn’t cope too well with its earlier segments, which become boring after you’ve already played through the game – to your death or success – multiple times.\n\nThea isn’t a game for everyone. It takes the natural complexity of well-done strategy games and adds a layer of roguelike to it – something that might be appeased if you play with the save function on, a travesty I did not commit. If you’re willing to be challenged, if you want to venture into a world with unique lore and characters, if you don’t mind starting over and over and over again, Thea: The Awakening might be just the game you wanted: a strategy roguelike which values forethought and rewards caution, with plenty of progression systems to incentive your return to it, and something entirely different from what I’ve recently seen released.","November 23, 2015","true","18.0"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

When I saw the screenshots I thought it was to good to be true and skeptical as I am I start reading the game info. Fantasy setting: check. Turn-based: check. Random maps: check.\nPrice: check....20 bucks? For an indie game? Did I have to wait for discount? hmmmmm.....\nSince this game combines two of my most favorite genres and start to look some let's plays on YT I was sure I need to have this game now. And I did not regret I paid full price for a game. This game.\nThe artwork is really beatiful and since 15 years I really like to see some devs takes an original approach in their game. At the moment of writing I don't have much hours in the game. It is like delicious food. You don't want to eat everything at once. With this game I have the same feeling. I own the game now and still like just to read about the game and watch other people playing. I don't want this experience is over too soon so I play with patience and wait a bit till it's updated to a more stable version so I don't miss any important changes.\n\nThe tutorial is very well done by integrated it as a story inside the game. If you played it once and you want a new start you don't have to do the tutorial again. Also you can reset your progress when you want or create another profile.\n\nThe artwork is really nice. The landscape and unit models are all made with love and the basic, very well done, design of the cards is very nice to let it feel like an old board/card game.\n\nEvery part of the game is made with a lot of attention. Everything is made of different layers. You have loads of items, resources you can combine and craft. Lot's of unit stats and many different styles of how to play the game.\n\nIt's a great idea to not have all the "gods" unlocked at the start of the game. It really give you some extra goal to play the game to unlock new content while you are playing.\n\nThis review is just to say to all my friends who like strategy/turnbased/4x games and are in for a very original fighting/diplomacy system in a card game form to buy this game.\n\nIf I know how to exactly play the game and find out all the different gameplay possibilities I extend my review in a more seriuous one game play wise. For now I just want to say how happy I am with this game and look forward for any DLC they want to make for this game because I buy them without doubt.\n\nThank you devs! Did I say the artwork is really nice?\n\n---Update after a few days---\n\nI'm more and more excited about the game after playing it now more then 10 hours. I don't even have enough space to write everything I wanted. For me the game can compare easiliy with my 3 classics of lifetime and that is the first time in ten years I say something about a game. This is what I was waiting for since Heroes III, Disciples II, Age of Wonders and now there is Thea: The Awakening.\n\nWhile it's very different then that games listed (graphics are 2015 standard) it give me the same feeling of love for a game.\nThe fact is that every game you start is a new adventure with so many different items, fights and challenges that it keeps you hooked for hours after hours even before knowing how to play well and start to read about stats and configure your party as best as possible.\n\nSame for the card game. While I was skeptical at first how well this would work i'm impressed.\nIt's challenging, random but fair and after your card draw even when it's bad you have change to win the fight. PC character don't have hidden profits or invisible buffs. It's just how it is and not frustrating at all even when you loose.\n\nIs the game really that perfect? It is! But with room for improvement on map navigation. Maps are huge and finding important places back is a real survival itself. More diversity in starting town is welcome. More content (it's only 4400 objects now) is welcome. Interface can have some improvements (lot of useless clicks sometimes). Show movement rate on different terrain. Make it possible in the future to let an expedition make a kind of outpost to hide fog of war in area where build and let you manage some resources from there. Those are my suggestions.\n\nIn the time playing I had 3 big updates. Devs respond within hours on the forum and are very passionate and kind.\n\nGame gets better when you play more. Too much to discover in just a few hours time. They added Amazing huge maps, Iron mode, difficulty options are the best list I saw in any game, almost no bugs I found while it's still EA.\n\nI'm really amazed. I give this a 10/10 because I want to have some space left for the 11/10 because the devs promissed us free DLC and event editor in the future.","November 13, 2015","true","85.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","1"

Great atmosphere\n2. Interesting approach to resources and building makes choices important.\n\nBad:\n1. Save game function is just terrible.  Either remove it altogether and play roguelike for real, or make it useable.\n2. Managing character inventory and party loot is just awful.\n3. The starts are not even vaguely balanced.  There is such a thing as a 'hopeless' start - in fact it is very common.  Get used to starting, looking around, and then wiping the save.  Totally tedious.\n4. The research tree impacts far too little on play.  Loot will generally exceed research discovery, making it rather pointless - especially with the difficulty in gathering distant resources.\n5. Bigger is pretty much always better.  More people equals win.\n\nThea was fascinating for the first play through (which was about 120-150 turns).\n\nBut: the following playthroughs I just cannot get invested into.  So many things I've seen before, and only one or two gems that I find occassionally.  It just isnt enough for me to spend the time on - I find my frustration exceeds my enjoyment.  The game's faults exceed the value of seeing the content that I didn't experience before.\n\nInterface improvements would perhaps prevent me feeling like I've been struggling with the game itself, rather than facing the wonderfully interesting challenges of the world.  Immersion was destroyed by frustration.\n\nI rate it an 9/10 for a short experience, but I just cannot bring myself to want to play it again, so overall a 3/10.","December 22, 2015","false","37.6"," 55 of 89 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","55","89","0","0"

I guess it's one of those "love it or hate it" things.\n\nThe combat system is pretty innovative and I liked it at first, but it gets old really fast, especially since every kind of challenge works exactly the same, only using different stats.  Gathering is also really dull, and takes longer than it should due to the somewhat clunky interface.  Also, most of the things you can craft aren't particularly useful and there's no point to making them once you can make better things.  There's also no other players in the game, only wandering monsters and predefined encounters, very unusual for a 4X game and not a change I like.\n\nAnother problem is the game's reliance on random chance to generate difficulty, rather than actually making the game difficult.  Between the hordes of suicidal bees/rats/bats/spiders that continually insist on attacking you, making you spend several minutes each time to defeat the non-threats (because the auto-resolve tends to hurt you a lot more than you would actually get during the combat), you'll occasionally get events with much more powerful creatures, and the difficulty indicators don't always do justice to what you're actually fighting against.  Sometimes random chance screws the player over with how the cards are drawn (generally, whoever can get their heavy-hitters out in the front will win), and the card system also stifles party diversity (ie, you'll be put in situations where your gatherers are pushed onto the front line while your warriors are put in the back, and you only get one reshuffle, which sometimes doesn't actually reshuffle the cards).\n\nThe story is meant to be one of the strong points of the game, but overall I'm not impressed so far.  From what I've played through, it seems like a rather stereotypical fantasy story (evil racist humans ruin everything for the good pure elves with their nefarious pursuit of science over magic and knowledge over faith), and the player character has a very limited set of responses (it says there's other options that are unavailable, but doesn't explain why - do I need to do something else or obtain some specific skill/material, or is it just based on the god I'm playing?).\n\nAlso, the game doesn't allow you to have multiple save files, so you're basically playing one ironman game at a time.","November 28, 2015","false","8.3"," 45 of 72 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","45","72","0","0"

I have played a bit and with my hand on heart i can recommend it!\n\nTo make it short:\n-  Events - based on Slavic mythology with dialogue options and if more skilled villagers are they allow you to unlock more dialogue options and other ways to finish them, not only by fighting.\n- Crafting - there are around 40 materials and bluprint for simple sword has over 100 ways to create it and when you add special bonuses from materials your had can blown away.\n- Card Game - which is a whole system to deal with opponents. Fights? Diplomacy tests? Rituals? And more are handled by tactial card game, where character statistics are calculated differently for each of those challenges.\n\nEven when i have unlocked and discover quite a bit of game content, there is always something i haven't try and like in all Civilization games, where you play the same game all over it feels like you can do things better or think about speed runs ;)\n\nTo sum it up, if you love turn based strategy games and want to feel "one more turn" syndrom again, this game is for you!","September 30, 2015","true","118.8"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

Every god have unique abilities that will help your followers in some way, but beside that you will play it as turn-based rpg strategy with card combat mechanism.

My first impression was that it's a crossover of Civilization and Burntime. The connection to the first one is pretty obvious, the latter came to my mind after my first try of the game, which didn't go so well (Burntime was a very hard post-apo survival game from 1993 in case you're not familiar with it). But I gave it another try and definitely don't regret it (apart from staying up till 5 a.m. ;)) - the second try was much better. The "just one more time" syndrome is strong in this one!\n\nAlso I'm pretty excited with the slavic mythology theme - it's occurs very rarely, even tho the "Witcher" series picture a lot of slavic folk creatures, there slavic pantheon is nowhere to be seen in gaming business. This is another big plus of Thea: The Awakening: if you're familiar with slavic mythology, then you'll finally be able to play a game that uses it, and if you don't know it yet then you have a perfect way to try something different from the usual setting you keep stumbling upon :)","September 30, 2015","true","29.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

After only 5 hours into roguelike game I can list all monster comps and tactics against them. Simplest way to do this is army strength. This one really ruins the game\n2.make it so if you have more than 95% chance to beat monster in any way you can you get the loot automatically and not forced to click auto-resolve for 2 hours untill monsters become stronger\n3.while different types of challenges are great their variety ruins it a bit as well (you will never try to make a talking or a sneaking party coz you just don't have enough men to spread so thin) If your warriors have some additional stats - great, if not - you won't bother.\n4.the stats on weapons need to be way higher to make sense, otherwise you just pick the highest damage and variety of weapons falls from 2000 to 5(this actually clicks great with my previous point - you will never give a character a will weapon for example coz you can't will-solve all problems but you can fight-solve almost all so you always pick damage)\n5.is it me or constructions except well are useless? For example you will never ever need smithy - one crafter is more than enough for making key items, you can find the rest on your adventures. Same with watchtower - by the time you build it your adventurers will already explore that much.\nSame with medical tent - you will never make it to town. Maybe last one should give you a doctor on the next baby born?\n6. add hotkeys and hotkey list - this is a roguelike(not important but easy and will make game better)\n7.side-materials like darkwood are useless cos it's always better to unlock elvenwood and they are the same?\n8.Maybe for the sake of making characters for the challenge when a baby is born you can make a sacrifice to Gods so it receives stats you need? For example you give 5 rubies so it receives higher chance of getting bigger strength.\n9. Need to add option of receiving a doctor(maybe sacrifice as well) They are key party members.\n10. Main point - death of party member almost in any case means game-over. Newborns cannot compete with stronger monsters. If this is core of game design you need to make medicine abundant and add medical - challenge to save lives. Otherwise blind chance can ruin your game, while you can do nothing.\n11.Dunno if it's me but making different kinds of food is not worth sending x expeditions to gather them all? Better send second group of warriors to move slower but explore more.","November 20, 2015","false","7.0"," 65 of 113 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","65","113","2","2"

Can sense there will be a lot of great potentials in the finished product. The game managed to mix the greatness from games of various genres together very well but it is not really a copy\clone or an improved version of any specific game, but rather unique on it’s own.\n\nAs the game is still in EA, so there are definitely some cons that can be very annoying and affect the gameplay experiences negatively.

So I am giving a 7.5/10 to the game at it’s current EA stage, but this game definitely has the potential of hitting 10/10 as a finished product.\n\nAll in all, this EA is definitely worth the money spent and highly recommended to people who enjoy a civilization-like game with a mix of fantasy RPG, exploration, survival, village management\building, crafting, resource management etc. Any improvement in gameplay that will come with the continuous development after this is a great plus.\n\nCurrent Cons –\n\nThought the learning curve of the game is not too difficult, the game is not easy either, So expect some difficulty and frequent deaths\failures especially in the first few games.\n\nEarly game can be very frustrating especially to players new to such genre as the game can be quite difficult especially with the combat. The placement of your team is too randomized in combat and there is very high chance of your weakest link like scholar, medic, workers, greenhorn warriors etc being placed at the frontline and getting slaughtered easily. So expect a lot of casualties in the early game especially when the enemy AI tend to like to ‘gang’ your weaker team. In one occasions I have 5 enemy teams continuously attacking my team one after another all in the same turn, resulting in me losing 7 out of the 10 villagers in that single turn with the only medic gone too. Ouch!.\n\nThe rate\chance of your children (assuming you still have any) growing up or random recruits joining your village is too random and too rare. In many games I only get one grown up\new recruit after 100 turns, and that is after already losing quite a few good men. This make the game even harder as the replenishment rate of your villagers simply doesn’t catch up with the number of deaths.\n\nThe village management\building is too simplified at it current development stage. Too few things to build\improve and too few interactions available in the village interface as most building are only providing passive bluff\produce products. Hope to see more improvement on this aspect in the future.\n\nNo option to expand\establish new village. So you are stuck with one and only village throughout the game. (But understand this may change as the game developed)\n\nOnly one savegame allowed per play through, and starting a new game overwrite that one and only save. :(\n","October 7, 2015","true","31.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The card mechanic as a resolution method for combat, social encounters, stealth, assassination, natural disasters, etc., is one of the best, most fresh approaches to mechanics and challenge resolution I have seen in a game in, well, forever.\n\nFor a taste of gameplay (minor spoilers for one of the many, many encounters that may pop up), on my first game after a team of my village's best got eaten by a dragon and I had to scrounge up a B team to get back out in the world and start collecting/scavenging/exploring again, a pack of Werewolves decided to show up to my incredibly undermanned village. I thought I was dead, but it turns out having silver is handy in this sort of situation and I was able to shift the encounter from a combat one to a social one. It so happens that my stay at home crafting crew, who were incompetant at combat, were really good talkers.\n\nI think that encounter had half a dozen other options for resolution that I couldn't even access (the game notes how many possible options there are that you can't choose in a note for each encounter). Even the run of the mill combat encounters with giant rats has several approaches if you have the right skills.\n\nI think there needs to be a little bit more balancing, but the card mechanics and village development feel really solid already. Most of the craftable weapons fill a specific role that makes them pretty effective, though staves could use some love. I especially like how the survival aspect focuses on the impact of food variety, which gives several significant buffs to the villagers and expedition if they are carrying a variety of food.\n\nAll in all, it is well worth the price of admission, especially if you are a fan of RPGs and 4X style games. Even if your not, just seeing the card system in action is pretty worth it in my book. It's nice to see a developer coming up with different approaches that let players consistently apply solution other than combat.","October 12, 2015","true","32.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

So expect things to be fixed and/or changed. Also beware gameplay spoilers.\n\nJokes aside, game is pretty fun, with complex character development, which you cannot really control outside of items, but it kinda works. Combat took a bit of getting used to, but you can do some crazy stuff with it once you get the hang of it: example. Say you got scub peasants in your army and it looks pretty bad, relax doe. Put ♥♥♥♥♥♥ peasant on field, buff him up, move him in priority to attack, confuse those he wont gib, armor and counter enemy tactics. What was looking to be a grim defeat turns into a landslide victory, thanks to the smart usage of skills.\n\nThere are a lot of stats your characters can have any surprisingly most are actually helpfull. Particularly i found Willpower, conversation and magic to be top tier picks. They come in handly on so many occasions, compared to say 'animal interaction'.\n\nGameplay is polished, not a single crash over 29 hours played. Yes there are spelling mistakes here and there like missing ' sign or 'dead' instead of 'deed' but these are all minor. The setting is old 6-12 century slavic mythos, one that has very little market saturation, granted there is no special market demand for that sort of thing, regardless it feels very refreshing, compared to 1 billion zombi games, endless platformers and ww2 ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOne of the biggest flaws the game has is the autoresolve issues - its completely broken. You take squad of elite warriors who just took down a dragon without taking a single scratch and pitch them against 5 bees, a beyond trivial encounter by that point. Its like an earthworm trying to battle an Abrams tank. Somehow the said tank might take immense damage  or even get destroyed? Meanwhile 8 peasants somehow take down an enemy tribe they had no business winning agaist. ?????\nAlso slight gear balancing issues, like tier 2 fur from wolves has no practical applications whatsowhever, same with wicker, tier 3 gems etc. Heavy armors are ridiculously underpowered aswell, compared to what you get for your material investment/alternatives from different gear gain using same materials.\n\n[Severely lacking variation for buildings, aswell as constructing additional villages and or multiplayer.]\n\nComing with a really small price tag, this game definitely is worth a buy and easily scores from 6/10 to 8/10, depending on personal prefferences.\n\n","September 30, 2015","true","38.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

It is also the sort of game you can find yourself still playing after the sun has risen.\n\nMy first successful completion of a game was a nine-hour marathon (huzzah for holidays!)  It wasn't all spent actively playing the card mini-games.  Your success in this game can be enhanced considerably by careful consideration of your assets.  I could spend several minutes just determining who I want in my expedition and who would remain in my settlement.  Then there were the many decisions regarding items, who would get which item, how did those items enhance their strengths or plug some of their weaknesses.  Get this done and it is a matter of which goods or tasks are you setting off to accomplish.  Are you gathering some far-flung resources?  Will those resources help you craft goods to fill any gaps in your item coverage?  Do we have enough resources on hand to let the crafters build new items while the expedition fulfills some quests and drives the hordes of monsters away from your precious settlement?  These thoughts and your conclusions become even more important as you increase the difficulty level of the game.\n\nThe game randomly generates a map for your play.  You can find some games where you have an embarrassing fortuitous dispersal of resources very near to you.  Other games you're struggling with all of the critical resources far away, requiring time, effort, and considerable danger to gather them.  The latter situation is very frustrating, but it makes for a very interesting experience where one can't simply fall into a comfortable "I-WIN" pattern of play eliminating any challenge with subsequent plays through.\n\nI forsee Thea: The Awakening being a very much loved title in my collection for a long time to come.","November 25, 2015","true","45.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Seriously. There's a lot going on. Here's a video review of Thea based on my first impressions, or see below if you prefer to read:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=573240923\n\nDo you like RPGs? 4X strategy? Survival games? Roguelikes? Good, because I don't know which one Thea: The Awakening is and I'm pretty sure it doesn't either. All I know is it was created by MuHa games, and features a Slavic mythology setting. The story goes that the world Thea was engulfed by by a mysterious force called The Darkness. In Thea: The Awakening, it is up to you to find a way to rebuild Thea, banish the Darkness and strengthen mankind. There are 3 basic modes of gameplay in Thea. The world map, choose your own adventure style events, and card challenges.\n\nThe world map is a familiar hex grid. From here, you can manage your village and also your expeditions, which are mobile groups of people sent out to explore the world. Although I called Thea a 4X game earlier, it would be more accurate to say it's a 3X game. There aren't any expansion options. You can't build new settlements, or even grow the size in tiles of your village. Although this is missing, it is for good reason. Different tiles have different resources in them, and your units can only gather resources from the tiles in and adjacent to the village, or camp in the case of an expedition. As the village is fixed in size and can't move, expeditions are the primary means of gathering important resources. This is good because it rewards you for venturing beyond thre settlement's walls. The downside is that there isn't a lot to do each turn. Gathering, building, and crafting can all be automated, so I sometimes found myself burning away the turns waiting for something to do. It is possible to create multiple expeditions and have them do different things, but that requires manpower, which is a little rare in the early game. It is an apocalyptic world, after all.\n\nBoth the village and expeditions require food and fuel, and can be attacked by enemies. This means there is a bit of a balancing act between keeping people in the village and sending them out on expeditions. The random attacks also mean it's safer to create one big expedition than many small ones. Although this should lead to a situation where the reward is proportional to the risk involved, it doesn't really. High level crafting materials are more important than low level ones, and sources for these are often near high difficulty mobs which require more people to handle. For example, dragon bones will probably be near dragons. Sending people out to gather lots of low level materials isn't very beneficial, and there is no looming threat that requires you to grow as fast as possible. Enemy civilizations don't seem to exist, so you can take your time to grow. That said, I don't think Thea is too easy. Even on normal mode I had to deal with some character death, and there are many difficulty options available beyond that.\n\nAlthough Thea: The Awakening lacks some aspects typical of 4X games, it replaces them with new features. For example, choose your own adventure style events are a common occurrence in this game. These range in complexity, with some events leading to ongoing quests, and others being simple attacks by enemies. There seems to be a good variety of events, and you often have multiple ways to deal with the problems you face.  For example, even when dealing with random mobs, I got options to sneak attack them and poison them, in addition to a straight up fight. It's beneficial to take these options, too. Fighting can result in wounds, reducing a character's health and increasing the chance they die. As there are so few characters, it is important to preserve them. There is no chance of injury when choosing any of the alternatives to fighting. The rewards may also vary depending on the chosen option. One time, a group of orcs had kidnapped a few children, and I was sent to rescue them by a demon. Surprising none, It turned out that the demon was the one planning to harm the kids and the orcs were protecting them. I could have just killed the orcs and taken the kids, but instead I used the power of my words and won a speech challenge. They handed over the children, who would one day grow into new characters, and even gave me some rare materials with demon warding properties.\n\nMost of these events, like the orc example from earlier, are resolved through card challenges. The same card game is used for all challenge types, but different stats are used for each one. For example, weapon damage is what affects a character's offense in fighting challenges, but speech skill is what affects offense in social challenges. During the setup phase, the card minigame splits your character cards into two hands: offense and tactical. The offense cards are placed directly on the board, and can attack the enemy. The tactical hand uses a variety of abilities to provide support. For example, a character with medicine skill in a cure sickness challenge can provide a defense boost to an ally on the board. You can use the tactical hand to cause the opponent to discard cards from their hand, give your units first strike, increase their offense and defense values, confuse enemies, and even place the tactical card itself on the board. However after the initial setup phase, just 2 rounds of belligerence play out. Cards brought onto the board from the tactical hand are confused for the first round and can't attack until the second. After the second round is complete, the setup phase begins again. This goes on until either team loses.\n\nThea's card minigame is a very interesting way of making different skills as enjoyable and involving as combat. Due to the high level of abstraction, the same resolve mechanics are used across the board. This leads to a slight lack of variety, but only just. The varied skills of each character in the group are enough to differentiate the overall feel of the challenge types. More importantly, the character attributes are tied into the resolve mechanics in a meaningful way, and have a strong impact on the gameplay. For example, crafters might not be of use on the front line of fights, but they can be powerful in the tactical hand. My only problem is that sometimes the challenges take a long time because of the slow animations and repetition of the setup phase. Thankfully, there is an auto-resolve option to quickly deal with very weak foes.\n\nIn addition to the gameplay modes I spoke of earlier, Thea: The Awakening is advertised for its crafting mechanics. I'm not a huge fan of crafting in most games. I avoid it whenever possible, but in Thea it's a core part of the gameplay. To my surprise, I found the crafting system quite enjoyable. The way it works is that each recipe gives you the option of using different materials as substitutes, so if you don't have thread, for example, you can still make a shirt with leather. The higher the quality of the materials you use, the better the bonuses you get. Shields made of regular wood work just fine, but shields made of elven wood give a dexterity bonus. You unlock recipes through research, and you gain research points the same way you earn experience; by exploring the world and by defeating enemies. The crafting system also applies to construction, except buildings require more resources and provide different types of bonuses.\n\nGoing back to the story and setting, it feels a little generic. Although Thea claims to be based on Slavic mythology, it's more like they took the pantheon and some of the demons and threw them into a typical medieval fantasy setting. You've got the standard orcs, dwarfs, elves, and wizards running around, and the rare Baba Yaga seems more like a novelty than a c","December 11, 2015","true","4.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I wish I had enough free time to thoroughly describe how well designed it is for anyone on the fence about it, but I don't want to waste a moment of limited spare time I could spend playing it.  I do, however, want to give credit to these guys, as I hope they have great success with this title, they certainly deserve it.\n\nI think this is the kind of experience I, brad wardell, and the rest of stardock were hoping Elemental would become during its early development.  This game has such a cohessive and well thought out set of mechanics it generates its own very real tension, challenge, and personality.  Where many games end up being more or less a facade; asking the player to care, but not really giving them a reason to -the product of a designe philosophy focussing too much on goals, and less on how to actually achieve them.  Thea seems to have been built from the ground up off good ideas, and has developed them to their great potential to create something with substance.\n\nI can't say for sure whether you'll like it, you may not.  But if you're looking at it and thinking it's the kind of thing you're interested in, take my word that it is extremely well implemented and realized.

You have one city and as many expeditions as can survive.\n-Card game battles are nice.\n-The research, crafting and building trees are elegant and interesting.\n-The bonuses for carrying different food types mechanic is just superb especially as it interacts with all the other systems.\n-The quests and events offer meaningful choices that differ depending on your party compositions\n-The unlock system for races is definitely very rewarding.\n\nThings I don't 100% like:\n-Interface could use some tweaking.  Moving stuff around can be quite cumbersome.  Thery're already making progress on this.  Caveat to this complaint: This game is, at heart, a roguelike.  There isn't a rougelike made who's inventory management I haven't found annoying.\n\nPROTIP (non-spoiler category): Your number one objective early on is to get a feel for when you can autobattle without taking damage and when you should manually fight.\n\nThe card battles are well done, but you don't want to have to do each one.

The card game battle system is a pretty nice touch as well, and the game does an excellent job at explaining the mechanics.

Most of the game is solidly strategic: balancing resource needs, sending out gathering parties during the day turns, and slowly pushing back the wilderness around the settlement. Managing character loadouts and tasks can be a bit of a micromanagement chore and there are a few places the UI could be more intuitive.

First of all, this was my first 4X "roguelike" strategy game (I've yet to truly understand what that really means... something along the lines of: eXplore, eXploit, eXpand, eXterminate). However, the artfully designed characters and *almost* open-world caught my interest. Purchased it and it was definitely well worth it!\n\nGame Mechanics\nIn Thea, there are many combination of skills you can develop/train into your villagers. The availability to customize what gear you want to assign to each character also allows you to build a flexible team that can withstand any obstacle. Tools/Armors/Weapons/Structures can be crafted or constructed using different materials to develop different attributes or (in the case of structures) attract certain class of characters.\n\nThe combat system in Thea is an offense/tactic card game. I picked up the combat mechanics pretty quickly with the use of the available tutorial. It is intuitive and is not always the same. Monster movements are randomized which keeps you always on your feet. You don't know when the next wave of T5 monsters will come... When that time comes though, you better hope you have the gears to defend yourself or the insight to attack first!\n\nGame Environment\nThe game environment is absolutely amazing. The details of the monsters and your characters are superb. Over time, you'll begin to pick up a few things about certain terrains. Some terrains have more quanity of one resource than another. Understanding this and developing your build strategies around this will definitely make you a better player.\n\nThe quests in this game is also worth noting. The quests, based on your decisions, can lead to different results. The voice-over definitely allows you to immerse yourself into the environment. There are several main quests that appear to the player at different times. In addition to quests, there are randomized events that could help or hurt your settlement. Again, keeping you on your feet!\n\nGame Community\nThea has a very supportive community. New contents are still being developed and updated. A lot of these changes have been guided by suggestions made by the player-base so that is definitely a plus.\n\nOverall Ratings\nMusic - 10/10\nDesign - 10/10\nContent - 10/10\n\nAverage hours of gameplay per run - 5+ hours (This especially happens when you fall in love with your villagers and don't want any of them to die!!!)","December 10, 2015","true","80.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

As an old player who has been playing computer games for 25 years, it is hard to find anything truly new and exciting anymore. Fortunaly once in a while a gem comes that makes you interested in strategy games all over again.\nThea offers a new type of gameplay and a very interesting mixture of diferent genres. You have one village and must use it to its full potential to survive in a very dangerous world. There is no expansion here except camps made by your exploration party that you set in the wilderness to explore ressource nodes. Back in your village you use the ressources gathered or taken from enemies to create new equipment and improve your villagers and fighters.\nThe game is hard. It is considered a survival game where your village is your life. As turns keep progressing the game becomes harder and harder.

First of all, this was my first 4X "roguelike" strategy game (I've yet to truly understand what that really means... something along the lines of: eXplore, eXploit, eXpand, eXterminate). However, the artfully designed characters and *almost* open-world caught my interest. Purchased it and it was definitely well worth it!\n\nGame Mechanics\nIn Thea, there are many combination of skills you can develop/train into your villagers. The availability to customize what gear you want to assign to each character also allows you to build a flexible team that can withstand any obstacle. Tools/Armors/Weapons/Structures can be crafted or constructed using different materials to develop different attributes or (in the case of structures) attract certain class of characters.\n\nThe combat system in Thea is an offense/tactic card game. I picked up the combat mechanics pretty quickly with the use of the available tutorial. It is intuitive and is not always the same. Monster movements are randomized which keeps you always on your feet. You don't know when the next wave of T5 monsters will come... When that time comes though, you better hope you have the gears to defend yourself or the insight to attack first!\n\nGame Environment\nThe game environment is absolutely amazing. The details of the monsters and your characters are superb. Over time, you'll begin to pick up a few things about certain terrains. Some terrains have more quanity of one resource than another. Understanding this and developing your build strategies around this will definitely make you a better player.\n\nThe quests in this game is also worth noting. The quests, based on your decisions, can lead to different results. The voice-over definitely allows you to immerse yourself into the environment. There are several main quests that appear to the player at different times. In addition to quests, there are randomized events that could help or hurt your settlement. Again, keeping you on your feet!\n\nGame Community\nThea has a very supportive community. New contents are still being developed and updated. A lot of these changes have been guided by suggestions made by the player-base so that is definitely a plus.\n\nOverall Ratings\nMusic - 10/10\nDesign - 10/10\nContent - 10/10\n\nAverage hours of gameplay per run - 5+ hours (This especially happens when you fall in love with your villagers and don't want any of them to die!!!)","December 10, 2015","true","80.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You have one village and must use it to its full potential to survive in a very dangerous world. There is no expansion here except camps made by your exploration party that you set in the wilderness to explore ressource nodes. Back in your village you use the ressources gathered or taken from enemies to create new equipment and improve your villagers and fighters.\nThe game is hard.

I can't recall any single disappointment with this title, it delivered everything it promised, and more. Rare occurance nowadays, and I hardly recall anything that caught my attention for so long at a time in single player.\n\nOf course, you have to like this type of game - I don't think it would appeal to just anyone - but in my case it fits perfectly.\n\nWhat is most amusing in my opinion:\n\n- very well-thought mechanics of conflict resolution, based on cards. I would probably change it a bit in some details (especially in case of constantly fighting very high level monsters, which regularly drastically limit tactical choices exactly just by being high level only), but it is still awesome as it is.\n- frequent development, and a lot of changes and new free content\n- quick bug fixes (but frankly, I can estimate it mostly by reading dev updates, because I failed to experience any bugs on my own skin ;D)\n- slavic mythology;\n- a lot of events (some more interesting than the other);\n- quite fun crafting mechanics (though, I want even moaarr of that and hope it will be still developed and made even better!)\n- It is game under development in very good meaning of this - it is perfectly playable and interesting as it is, but still there are new additions, which makes the fun even better, and urges me to still come back and check on it.\n\nThere are a few minor issues:\n- late-game it might feel a little bit tedious to manage equipment of like 30-40 characters, running multiple expeditions and actually remember who you are equiping with what, and why you decided it in the first place ;)\n- I do not understand balancing of events occurance chance - some seem to occur to often. While I played some games more than 1000 days, and still took only 24% of events which I experienced - in the same time, and a few events were generated literally more than dozen times, sometimes even close to each other.\n- a pity that level up bonuses seem to be totally random, i'd prefer some choices in that departyment;\n- when limiting active party fight team up to 12 characters in conflict, you should be able to manually pick those who fight or don't fight, in case your party is much bigger\n- personally, I would prefer a little more serious language and feel of stories, now it is in many instances a little too humorous fantasy for my taste. That is pure taste issue, though.\n- I personally would add tooltips on reasearching resources/weapon, to know up front what exactly I am buying (like - of, great, I can gather the best type of something now, but then I discover, that it has really, really limited use for me, as I cannot use it to build something I thought I could.\nand...\n\nBut ok, I am critical by nature, and I could find many, many more issues I consider worth reworking :), but in the end all that matters is that they are mostly VERY minor, and mostly opinion/taste-based. Whole feel of the game is very positive, and I like it very, very much.\n\nIt has a soul, kudos to devs, they showed real love and passion for gaming, creating this. Money well spent.\n","May 25","true","142.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ManShrimp/recommended/378720/","ManShrimp","ManShrimp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ManShrimp/","47 products in account","This is one of the best 4X games I have ever played.  It has the best elements of Masters of Magic and Heroes of Might and Magic, with a few civilization style elements.  There is a short learning cliff in your first game, you can easily become overwhelmed by the rogue-like random encounters if you are using balanced groups and playing it safe, and those can make the game seem unwinnable.\n\nThe combat system is extremely fresh and novel, if you like collectible cards games, you will really enjoy the way party members are used.  To compare with Magic:TG, you have a deck in each combat composed of all your party members.  They are divided in half randomly, one group is your offensive deck and the other half is your tactical deck.  Party members played from the first enter into the combat, like a summoned creature, and will have stats based on what traits they have as what is gained from their equipment.  The tactical deck, however, when played must use one of their traits to have an effect like using a spell.  These can boost your in-play party members, empty cards from the opponents hand, or weaken enemy cards.  There is an auto-resolution system if you do not want to play the mini-game, and I have found it to be extremely fair so there isn't a punishment for never using the combat system.  If you are very good at the mini-game, however, you can win some battles that the auto-play will treat as a loss and you can get away with extremely risky expeditions that way.\n\nIf you are really into roleplaying story, this game has extremely well written encounters.  I enjoy reading them, and usually despise story elements in similar games.  Getting the same encounter repeatedly is pleasant, there are many possible outcomes which change based on who is present in your party at the time and what skills they have.  An encounter will show you the number of unavailable options, but does not tell you what they are or what is needed to unlock them and the number of options for most encounters is very high.  There are still some random encounters with 11+ options that I have not seen, even after clearing 2 default options.\n\nIf you are not interested in story, and just like strategy games, there are options to plow through storyline elements with minimal fluff as a default option for any storyline quest you attempt.  The NPCs are very gracious about being told to shut up and just give you the things you need without explanation.  Even on the first play through!\n\nThe crafting system is hands down the best thing I have ever seen.  At first I was disappointed at the limited number of buildings and equipment, until I realized that using rarer materials changes the appearance and statistics of the building.  You can build a smithy out of wood like normal, or build it from bones and start randomly recruiting wild animals from rats (don't laugh, a brave little rat died in a storm to save one of my veteran gatherers) to wolves and bears!  Building from more exotic materials will let you get other demi-human races from fantasy lore such as Goblins, Orcs, Elves, Dwarves, and Demons.\n\nYou are limited to only one village the entire game, however you can pack up a group of people and take them into the world to camp.  While camping, the party members there act like an extra village and can gather materials.  If you find a good location with access to basic materials like wood and food, you can leave a second camp there permanently like a second city.  The only limitation with camps is that they never build any buildings to help them defend themselves, and they can't craft new equipment for themselves.  Some other group must act as the go between, taking resources to the village and then delivering finished equipment back to them.  Children are only created at your home village, but can be carried out to your camps where they can grow into adults if you prefer.\n\n10/10 game, I have no complaints about the game apart from wanting a multi-player co-operative mode!","November 28, 2015","true","45.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I frequently try out non AAA games that pop up on my recommended screen and they generally are ok, but this is something else.\n\nWithout going into too much detail: The strategic map is varied, exciting and atmospheric. The tactical card game is reasonably deep, exciting, and not too repetitive. You can always auto-resolve anything stupidly easy although I think the auto-resolve is a little generous to the player.\n\nI started out on Difficult (3/4 difficulty) and it is a genuine challenge. First couple of tries I just ran out of people by risking them unncessarily, you really do get attached to your individuals as it is very difficult to replace them. The constant struggle to keep resources coming in while expanding and doing the main quest, as the world closes in around you and seems to ramp up in difficulty over time, is extremely engaging. I bought this for £12 and keep coming back for more, I would happily have paid more in retrospect.\n\nLooks like loads of replayability with different Gods to try, different quests, and a very random world.\n\nArt fantastic, as is the music, more music please!\n\nDo yourself a favour and buy this now.

When first glancing at the screenshots you might expect this game to be a standard fantasy 4X, but it really isn't. The lore and story of the game is quite unique, and the main mechanics involve managing gathering materials and crafting for a single settlement. You don't build units, instead you have a number of children that age up as time progresses. Combat and other conflicts use a card mini-game for resolution, and whilst at first this may be off-putting, it's actually quite enjoyable once you get used to it. Additionally you aren't in competition with AI, instead you explore, craft, and complete quests at your own pace, which I quite enjoy.\n\nI'm really looking forward to seeing how this game will develop, as gameplay is already very satisfying and enjoyable. I only have a few minor complaints; there are a number of typos, however they will surely be fixed with time. Additionally  the UI for moving your expeditions requires one too many clicks in my opinion, but the dev seems very receptive to feedback, so hopefully this will change in the future. Finally the auto-resolve option for conflicts is pretty much guaranteed to result in failure, but you'll get more enjoyment by manually completing the battles any way.\n\nI'd definetly recommend giving this game a chance, especially if you're looking for something a bit different from the usual.","October 4, 2015","true","8.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

While this is Muha games first major release they have previously created a number of flash games such as: Town of Fears, Road Wolves, Racing Toys and Zack’s Hardware. Individual members of the team have worked on titles such as: The Witcher 2&3, DiRT Showdown, GRID 2 among others. It’s also worth noting that the studio also has created the (fast becoming popular) Honey Hex Framework available from the Unity store which Thea uses.\n\nWelcome to the world of Thea; An apocalyptic force known only as ‘The Darkness’ has engulfed the world for an age, warping and transforming the land and its creatures. Even the Gods themselves have been stripped of their power, only able to watch as their followers dwindled in the face of the horrors. Just as the last embers of hope began to fade the light returned to Thea once again, the Gods and the land awoke; the few remaining survivors are left with the daunting task of trying to rebuild and survive. There are many creatures warped by darkness and there are no heroes, monster slayers or great armies able to combat them. As one of the gods reawakened you must guide your people through the land that by day is at best; dangerous, but as night falls the creatures become even more aggressive. You must find out what happened to the world and how, as the return of the light may be fleeting.\n\nThea is a strategy based game that at first glance looks very much like “Civilisation” or “Heroes of Might and Magic” there are however a number of differences in gameplay and mechanics which turns the game into something unique and interesting. For starters the player only has one settlement throughout the game, there is an ability to set up small camps which can gather nearby resources and as such can act as a forward base of operations. However, players will only possess the ability to operate and defend these camps in mid to late game. Thea also has a heavy “choose your own adventure” influence in that random events will occur and often the player is given a number of choices in how to deal with this occurrence. This choice will not only effect this instance but may affect other events and possibly even elements of the main story. There are two available starting deities to play with, an additional six being unlockable each of which have different perks/abilities and therefore playstyles. Thea also features a deep and interesting crafting/research system.\n\nWhilst there exists a number of different ways to face the challenges in the game, one of the easier ways is through combat, and indeed the combat system is familiar yet different. The player cannot train new units and is reliant on new survivors joining their cause as well as children being generated and growing up. There are a number of different types of survivor from warrior to farmer and a few more in-between. Those joining your village will already have a type, however children growing up will have a choice of what they can become, which can prove extremely useful. The combat itself is done via a card based mini-game, as are the different challenges, each with their own unique twist. The card mini-game is reminiscent of “Magic: The Gathering” and indeed as such whilst having the appearance of being very simple has a number of different mechanics in play that can change outcomes drastically. The game does have a high learning curve but the player is assisted with an excellent tutorial/help system that teaches the basics and is also available on hand upon request.\n\nThe game as a whole has a very substance over style feel to it, which in a game were mythology and lore are key is definitely the way to go. Being an isometric turn-based strategy the graphics are not the priority however the animations and textures are still extremely nice and help bring the lore of the game to life. One of the things players will likely notice is the graphics in combat as the various characters and creatures are as mentioned cards which are hand drawn in appearance, but as indicated what it lacks in graphics it makes up for in gameplay mechanics. The music and sound assets provide an excellent undertone for the game as a whole and like all good music and sound assets give the game that little extra boost.\n\nOverall I have to say that although the game has a fairly high learning curve it is extremely interesting and rewarding particularly for those like myself who have an interest in mythology and lore. However, that being said there is still lots of nice elements that would interest 4x, RPG and rogue-like players alike. One of the biggest surprises for me was a fully customisable experience not just with the “choose your own adventure” elements but indeed the difficulty be can be completely customised to suit different play styles. Also as mentioned there is a rogue-like continual progression system so even if a playthrough ends in disaster the player will get some experience towards levelling up their chosen deity. One addition I would like to see is a multiple save system so different deities can be tried out. There is much more to the game than what I can cover here, if you like what you see check it out. Thea is completely mouse driven although I used the steam controller in my playthrough.\n\nOverall: 8.1/10 For full breakdown, screenshots etc, please visit website.","November 23, 2015","true","22.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It's part 4X strategy, part collectable card game, with roguelike elements sprinkled in for a game that will feel familiar in many aspects, but is refreshing in both style and play.\n\nWhere do I begin?  I suppose with where I began in the game: a blank intro screen that I couldn't get past.  I posted on the forums, which was quickly responded to by the developers.  A few others were having this issue too.  Within 2 days there was a patch released which fixed this, among many other fixes/changes.  I know it's early, but these guys are updating quite often and I'm already more confident in this product than I have been many Early Access titles due to how playable the game already is.\n\nSpeaking of the game, it's great fun.  The art style and lore is based on Slavic mythology, which is unique and interesting.  This game plays like a 4X where survival will feel more random than you're used to, so be ready to get shafted sometimes (but that's half the fun of roguelikes, isn't it?) by things like God-created storms ravaging your town and people.  But if you manage to survive, you'll find that the game has quite a bit of depth to it already, including a card game battle system and crafting systems I will discuss later.\n\nThe game itself is a little micromanage-heavy, but it remains interesting due to so many options, especially when it comes to crafting.  You will be constantly trying to craft or loot better equipment to upgrade your older and newer companions with.  I've spent probably more time than I should have switching out every possible option for crafting a club for example, which gets extensive when you need multiple types of material (metals, woods, leathers, gemstones, string materials, etc.) to craft an item, and later in the game you will have quite a few options of each material, and most materials add varying amounts of stats, sometimes with unique bonuses as well.\n\nThe card game is pretty interesting as well.  I would suggest reading the tutorial for it the first time.  It's a little complicated at first, but if you've ever played a card game it will be easy to learn.  There is actually quite a bit of strategy involved for how simple it looks.  The people of your expeditions and town will be the cards you use to fight your battles, which gives it a deck-building aspect as you grow in size.  Most battles will be realistic, where your people will suffer wounds for taking damage, and can potentially die.  Some are test battles, of mental/physical/stealth/etc skills your people may or may not have.  The one good thing about the test battles is you can succeed in many parts of the game without having to risk the lives of your people, but they can be nearly impossible to win if you don't have the skills required.\n\nOne minor complaint I have is some of the text in the game seems a bit rushed.  I remember doing one event/quest where my reply to a character was something like "ok cya".  "See ya"or "see you" would have been alright, but "cya" doesn't exactly help immerse me in this world.  Other than that, the story and game have been very enjoyable.\n\nSome people will say the game gets too hard and you get destroyed around turn 100 in the forums.  I've been playing my first game for 15 hours, and I haven't lost yet.  I'm on roughly turn 350 as of writing this, and have finally found a strategy that works great.  My town almost wiped when I lost half my people in an expedition, and my town was getting attacked with only 4 people defending at one point.  But now I've managed to get to 15 people, with 70+ children, and am constantly hiding in my town but slowly building both population and equipment, getting ready to wage a massive conquest across my map once I get a big amount of people.\n\nBut is this game worth it?  If you like 4X games and this concept sounds interesting to you, I believe it's worth the price already for you to try it out.","October 3, 2015","true","33.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

How long have I slept? A century? My worshippers, so few now, I must guide them...\n\nFor this player, 'Thea: The Awakening' has been a love at first sight affair. The player takes the role of a deity, who in turn takes the role of a group of followers. These followers have emerged from an apocalypse of darkness only to have the new dawn illuminate further perils to come. Despite this premise, set in a decidedly dark fantasy world, I cant help but think of Rick from the Walking Dead as I direct my group of survivors to scavenge supplies and fortify, survival our primary concern. I begin to grow attached to each individual in the group. I realise this as night approaches and the sunlight retreats. The dead walk tonight, not far from my settlement, and my four best fighters are out on a salvage mission. To the north my lookouts spot giant spiders scuttling through the dusky gloom. Supplies are getting low, and our resident medic may be about to have a very busy night. My non combatants arm themselves as best they can and they pray for me to guide them to dawn...\n\nWhat is not to like? Buy this if you like fantasy games, survival games, games with crafting and gathering, heroes that have to eat, games where you can rename every villager and hero you own, card games, TBS games, games where combat is an option but not the only way to get through the night...

Large scale adventure with a small village of people in a random world. Your village really is just a village with a handful of people so everyone counts, even a crow (yes I'm talking about a bird) that joins your people has it's uses.\n\nYour enjoyment of the game hinges highly on how well you take to the card system that resolves all challenges (combat or otherwise) are resolved, in which relevant stat become the offense, defense, and special abilities rating for your villagers whom are represented as cards played from a hand. Takes a little getting used to all the stats and how they'll play out, but for those whom love that sort of thing like myself will find the options very engaging. Added to that the permadeath risk gives you some investment in challenges you might have seen before. Although there is a auto-resolve feature to quickly breeze through pushover challenges.\n\nThe story writing is solid and flavorful, with some quality world building which makes up the heart of the game. The art design is very endearing, and I like how the cards representing you villagers and their opponents go for the hand drawn/hand crafted look. Defiantly one of those game I wish there was more of, both in terms of more content for this game (which the developers are working on and adding too), and more game following this RPG, management, & strategy combo.\n\nBig note: There is a fix start location that CANNOT be changed (where your only settlement is permanently - though you can make multiple indefinite camp sites). It significantly impacts the difficulty of the games, and can be extremely frustrating for 4X fans whom are used to picking their settlement sites and trying to optimize resources, but does give a bit FTL or Bedlam feel to it.","December 10, 2015","true","89.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Civilization V and Endless Legends are the 4x titles i play occasionally. Dwarf Fortress is too hard for me although i like playing it. Now on to the review.\n\nI reccomend Thea: The Awakening because it's a fresh take on the 4x genre. They pride on classifying it as a 3x game though, you manage only one village so no need for expansion here. I won't spoil the story here but i do love the mythology and i think it's a huge factor for the game.\n\nNow in this one village that's randomly generated from the start you can gather two resources, craft equipment for your people, and erect buildings. The thing is the resources you need to craft and build stuff are scattered all around the map. The only way to gather it is to create an 'expedition', a unit consisting of some of your people, and send them on a fetch quest.\n\nExpedition units can also do quests, hunt monsters that may threaten your village or destroy their gosh darn ding-dang lairs. This will earn you experience points to level up all your people and get you research points which you can spend on new crafting recipes, reveal new resources on the map, or get a new building blueprint. Oh and your people are divided into different classes like warrior, or gatherer, or ... the other peasants that make stuff for you, and many more. You can even have characters from other races!\n\nDoes it sound exciting to you? Does it? If it does you should buy it! If not, maybe i'm not reviewing it right because it's hella fun. I have a total of 24 hours gameplay when i wrote this review and i suspect there'd be many more because a DLC is coming.","April 8","true","32.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Crafting, gathering, construction, combat, exploration, research, all the elements have a distinct set of mechanics and challenges to them that make Thea a wonderfully rich game, and a massive vector of "Just One More Turn Syndrome." It is most certainly worth the price despite a few small imperfections.\n\n\nThe Long of It:\n\nAs a fallen God, stripped of his or her power, you have only a ragtag band of people and a small village left, and Thea: The Awakening is your struggle to help your villagers survive an unforgiving world, to lead them through their trials and dangers, and to hopefully ensure their survival while you work to regain your lost power. With very few allies and a great many enemies, however, your best efforts may only serve to temporarily stave off the starvation or devouring of the few men, women and children you have left.\n\nAs your villagers overcome dangers, however, they and their village will grow in strength, and only through maintaining a constant curve of growth can you continue to face the hardships coming your way. Organising your villagers into expeditions who will scout the surrounding land, gather resources and defeat enemies is indispensible to your survival, and it is these expeditions which bring in the experience, research and resources your villagers in the home base need to craft new items, construct new buildings and learn new blueprints.\n\nAs your village grows more powerful, however, so too will resistance, and sitting still for long is not an option. The world wants you dead, and frequently your villagers will have to defend themselves, or (hopefully) pre-emptively mount an attack against the various denizens of Thea. Combat is resolved through a tactical card game that is a mix between tactical strategy and Random Number God decree. While complex and difficult the grasp, the card system offers many possibilities and is used for all kinds of challenges (not just combat) with your villagers and enemies having many different values based on their abilities relevant to that particular challenge, requiring a diverse group to counter the dangers thrown your way. Equipping a doom squad of ironclad soldiers who stomp on everything they see is certainly a possibility, but fighting takes a heavy toll on your villagers over time, while other challenges, if available, will often see them emerge unscathed. Diversity is absolutely essential in Thea.\n\nAs your expeditions brave hardships, dangers and starvation, your villagers on the home front work tirelessly to bring in resources close to home, to craft weapons, armours and other items, and to construct buildings, using the resources your expeditions bring in. The crafting system is very complex, with every item requiring a combination of materials and every material changing the item, depending on the combinations you use. This makes it a constant choice of whether or not to use a combination of highly advanced and mediocre materials to craft a decent item, or to take the risk and wait for more advanced materials to make a more powerful object.\n\n\nThe Right of It:\n\nAs already mentioned, Thea is wonderfully rich, complex and vibrant, with your villagers being more than just units, but truly characters you will come to care about and know very well, and the death of one of them will strike you hard, and not only on the tactical front. As they grow, they will become more developed and unique, giving every character a complex mix of abilities. The game is essentially classless - while characters will be marked as having a certain class, in reality every character will be able to learn every skill and so your village will become a melting pot of all kinds of people, and it's great to see it develop that way.\n\nCombat is complex and tactical, with quite a bit of Random Number God malarkey thrown in, and the card system, while working differently for all challenges, does remain recognizable and needs no constant attention shift from the player as challenges change. So while it does call upon different skills, the core remains the same, and requires character versatility while not constantly bogging down the player in different types of systems.\n\nCrafting and construction are a fun and useful, and the research system is streamlined, yet versatile. Having different materials available to you will completely change what kind of items you can make, and you will often have to make tough decisions on how to best use your materials, as well as which villagers you assign to which task.\n\nQuests are many, and although many fall under the "go to X, overcome challenge Y" variety, they're always given some more depth and life through writing and player choices, and players can clearly tell the developers have poured much love into their world from the writing and lore, based loosely on Slovenian mythology. It's not without the occasional typographical error, but if you're not willing to overlook such a minor thing, you missed out on a career as a surly English teacher.\n\n\nThe Wrong of It:\n\nLet me make it clear right now that I am nitpicking, because Thea is a wonderful game in almost every respect. However, some small imperfections are worth mentioning (and then briefly forgetting, believe me).\n\nGiven the many varied builds you'll have in your group of people, it can sometimes get seriously overwhelming to keep track of it all. Sometimes it really is too much information, and while the devs have tried to mitigate this somewhat, there will still be times when you feel like you're trying to earn a degree in accounting instead of playing a game. It's complex, which is good, but it can be a bit daunting at times.\n\nThe card system, while certainly solid, has two drawbacks. Firstly, it's very complex and very little of it is explained in depth, so in the beginning, you'll often have no idea what you're doing until you've played it a significant amount of times. Sure, there are tutorial video links embedded in the game, but this isn't a very good solution. However, the computer can auto-resolve challenges and is reasonably adept at it, if you find things too complicated. Also, the card system is a bit too dependent on RNGesus, with the main determinator of combat (Initiative) being completely out of your control and determined completely randomly. Getting to go first makes or breaks a challenge in most cases, so making the player entirely dependent on a 50/50 coin toss about such an important element is a strange decision from MuHa.\n\nThe Random Number God will determine many more elements, and often, these elements could have been determined by other things just as well, giving the player some control where now he has none. For instance, you have zero control over when a child is born, when it matures, and what class it will be. No matter what kind of buildings or villagers you have, the game determines these things completely randomly and independently. Some children may mature in three turns, while others remain children for over a hundred. Even though a random element is always nice, this is a bit exaggerated, and it's a serious headscratcher.\n\nLoading times can be deplorable, and especially for new players who are still learning the ropes, and who will have to reload more often, this can require some persistence. It sometimes takes more than a minute to load a game (on an SSD!) and that's really too long in this day and age. The save system is also not entirely reliable, with the game sometimes loading an autosave even though you manually saved several turns later. It's not disastrous, but still important for MuHa to take a look at it for the free DLC/patch which is slated to be released soon.\n\n\nThe Last of It:\n\nI would have finished this review sooner, but I was too busy playing... just!... one!... more!... turn!","April 1","true","22.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Even after multiple attempts and a successful completetion of the campaign (with a rouge-like level of difficulty and permanence, it will take several attempts) I still feel like there is more to explore: different combinations of technologies, buildiings and combat.\n\nIt feels very much like the beggining of a game of civilization, with high risk high reward exploration mechanics. You will want to push for more, stronger resources, but in doing so you risk your units that have taken time to develop and equip. This encourages a purpetual opprotunity-cost analysis and makes success feel very rewarding.\n\nGood Game, worth trying if only to see how it shakes up the turn based civilization building stategy genre a bit with some influence of rpgs and rouge likes.","April 23","true","16.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Folklore! The game is immersive and loves to tug on my curiosity through choices given through random events. I was rewarded with lore and more places to explore. The mysteries of Thea just keep popping up. Some of the choices I've made really made me think, "Was that the right thing to do? ...then why do I feel guilt and regret?"  Good literature at work here, even on side quests.\n\nThe voices are well done. Adds immersion to the story.\nThe flavor art during triggered events are very well done.\n\nCombat:\nThe auto-resolve option seems to do a better job at fighting than my poor card playing skills, thank goodness. I enjoy the lore much more than combat. But it can be powerful I hear, once you learn the mechanics and effects of so many stats.\n\nTutorial:\nThe tutorial is very good. It too, asserts itself as part of the story. Keeping up the immersion, good idea. Do go through it. Only part it left out was Research window has 3 tabs on top that are easy to miss.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI hope they continue to add more lore and expand Thea.

Seems pretty much feature-complete for early access. It still has some spelling mistakes and I would like to see some hotkeys but otherwise its good enough to release in this form.\n\nIts pretty original - it reminds me a bit of King of Dragon Pass but played out on a more detailed hex based map - maybe the story telling is a little less deep but the crafting system, technology tree and character progression more than compensates for that. There's perma-death and a lot of randomness to the map so roguelike comparisons are valid too.\n\nAll fights and challenges are played out in a card battle that is sufficiently intricate to feel like you are deploying skill, but there are random elements to it too so occasionally it can feel like you've been rng screwed - I don't so much mind the way the targets are selected randomly as much as the random splitting of your cards into offense and tactics - which can leave all your best offense cards on the tactics side and vice versa. I do really like the way that there are various different types of challenge - fighting, tactics, intellect, sneaking which use the same system but different stats.\n\nI really hope they will continue to add new events to this in an ongoing way which will really add tot he longevity/replay value. I'm not sure how close to release it is or if there are other major systems they are planning to implement, but its worth purchasing in current form already - a really unique and compelling game.\n\n","September 30, 2015","true","26.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

These are done by both exploring and harvesting resources and building structures.\n\n\nThea is, depending your experience, either extremely hard or simple game, mostly due it's ( on higher difficulty than normal or custom games), one save slot policy  ( normal and easier games have autosave + one normal save), meaning if your people die, they die for good , unless you crash the game and are willing to start over from way way back in game time, so the game gets fairly decent amount of challenge specially on early combat.\n\n\nThere are plenty of random events that also affect the game play, from werewolf attacks to seducing demons and demented trees to cursed elves, boar hunts and herb groves, not to mention the random babies popping up after  inccubus style demon seduces all your women. Devs also apparently  intend to add more these later.\n\nFinishing game or losing adds experience to your god unlocking bonuses that make further games easier with that god, and unlocking more gods. So if you have trouble with higher difficulties, but want to try them anyway you can " level up" your god in lower settings to give your worshippers more abilities.\n\nMy particular favorite is the god of darkness, his sneak bonuses allow you to assassinate most enemies with stealthy enough team, without fighting, one example of ways to handle things in Thea, you do not always have to fight.\n\n\nSo, unless you didn't figure it out, all above are positive features,  not to mention this is one of those game tittles that you end up playing over and over again, so there is plenty of value for money invested in it, also the devs seem to be complete gem, I haven't seen this positive dev team since foresight ( each in their own way).\n\n\n\nNow there is only one major con in this game I'd like to bring out.\n\nIt's the combat and challenge mechanic.\n\nDo not misunderstand me, I like the mini card game, it's decent enough but not overally hard, it has one major flaw though : Every challenge, despite your ability you use, be it magic, strenght, battle, debate, exploration, sneak, strategy, poison.. so on check.. Uses this exact same mechanism.\n\nSo to but it overly harshly, they could have removed all the stats and left just combat abilities and you wouldn't notice the difference on " check" encounters, as the minigame is same for every one, your stats that define your bonuses just vary ( the weakest person in team can be your best in discussion check while your strongest warrior can suck at it).\n\nSo it gets bit repeative, I ended up using auto resolve a lot, despite the risks, simply due the cheer amount of battles and checks I did on my first playtrough.\n\n\nBut it summing everything up, is the ONLY grievance I have with this game.\n\nThat is.. impressive in itself.\n\nExtremely recommended on civ manage /explore strategy gamers and card game friends. Think it like dead man draw that made baby with sid mayers colonisation in single city mode, that had father named Eador, that sums it up.","November 26, 2015","true","27.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That often ends in disaster. It doesn't in this case. In a nutshell, there was a magical disaster in the past, and you play as one of the exiled (weak) gods trying to return to the world of Thea. Being weak though, you have to act through a small group of followers. The game is turn-based.\n\nYou control all the actions of your followers, and there is a single village from where you will direct their production tasks, create expeditions, and reclaim knowledge. You can recieve more followers through random events, building structures, or your choices in encounters. Each follower can level up and be equipped with a variety of gear according to their class and weight capacity. (The equipment crafting system is deep, and you also find gear after combat and events).  In addition to your human followers, you can also rarely try to recruit dwarves, demons, beasts, goblins, orcs, and elves- there maybe more I'm unaware of.\n\nBecause Thea is such an unusual fusion, following are some PROS and CONS to hopefully show the game's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nPROS\n-Exploring the randomly generated map for resource nodes, ruins, and monster dens is interesting and fun. Consistently creates the "just one more turn" feeling, followed by "oh crap, have I been playing THAT long?"\n-Art design is consistent. Subjectively, I like it. Know that what you see on the store screens is what you get in game.\n-Replayability. There are 8 gods you can play as, each of which give different follower "boosts" in line with their domain. Furthermore, as you complete games, your score indicates your progress towards regaining power as that god. Each god has five levels, and only the first is unlocked at the start. Each god appears to have a unique divine sub-quest, as well as some unique follower options in the core events.\n-RPG Mechanics. Each follower has a class, and the class determines their equipment slots and the range of skills/abilites granted on level up. Those abilities are checked in text-based encounter events and the combat card-game.\n-Skill-based tactical card game. Thea has a unquie card game, which is used for combat and "challenge events". Challenge events (hunting, social, poisoning, sneak, ect) are like combat, except your characters can't suffer wounds- potentially dying- in challenges. The game is skill-based because the player is given a large variety of tools to interact with it, and learning about different encounter types helps you plan better for furture challenges/combat.\n-Deep crafting system. Gathering resources (either by harvesting on the map, combat, or quest events) is a major focus of the game. You have to research the ability to make weapons and gear, and using higher quality resources results in more powerful gear. However, as different resources profide different bonuses depneding on their slot, there is A LOT of experimentation possible to determine what gear best suits your current follower makeup.\n\nCONS\n- Skill-Based tactical card game. I like the card game- I listed it as a PRO-  but it is central to the Thea. If you don't like card games, I can't imagine you enjoying Thea. If in doubt, check a LP to see it in action.\n- Rough Writing. There is an... exuberance to the writing, and a willingness to shatter the 4th wall with your responses. It can be jarring. If you can't stand references to the 4th wall, be aware they are frequently present in Thea. There are also a noticable number of typos and mispellings, though presumably those will be patched out in post-release patches.\n- End-Game Micromanagement. As you gain more followers and have more crafting options, playing optimally will require a larger amount of time in screens directing crafting and food production. This means less time actually exploring the map and interacting with events. If you don't keep up with increasing threat from mobs as the game goes on by either looting gear or crafting it, you will lose. End-game micro is a common issue in 4x types of games, and Thea has it as well. If you are a veteran of 4x games like Civ or Endless Space, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nBottom Line: This game is an absolute gem, managing to fuse disparate elements in an unusual and complimentary way. If the cons above don't give you pause, at a minimum check out an LP to see if you would like it. The fact that a four-person team created this is amazing.","November 27, 2015","true","214.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In the end, i bought it alongside The Witcher 3.\n\nLong story short, I´ll spend a LOT of time playing Thea before i get back to The Witcher 3. It´s an absolutely amazing game which has surpassed all of my expectations.\n\nIn Thea, you command a single settlement of followers of a weakened God, who have to gather their strenght to survive a barren world. Each of your people have a name, a picture and a particular set of skills. You form teams and send these teams to the world, in an hex based map, to explore, gather resources or complete missions.\n\nThere lies the first of Thea´s many great features. The missions and events that your people will encounter are really well written and have many possible outcomes, which are backed by a rich lore that makes the world worth exploring.\n\nNow, if you´re like me, you probably felt skeptical about the challenge system, or the "card minigame". It was the main reason why I was skeptical about this game. But, man, how wrong I was!\n\nThe challenge system is utterly brilliant. I´d go as far as say that it is the most intelligent system in all of the games i have played. The card game mechanic is used to resolve every challenge along the way - like battles, tests to sneak, brew poison, convince people not to kill you, planning strategy, etc. Since your followers have different stats, you´ll need a diverse group of people to be able to tackle the many challenges you´ll face along the way. Which means that none of the people are useless.  Many times my group of rugged warriors were saved by an almost senile old lady´s ability to convince a stronger group not to attack us. As you face the challenges, you can almost see the characters interacting between themselves, trying to overcome the obstacle. And you really feel when they fail - or worse, when they die.\n\nIn short, if you like 4x or turn based strategy games, buy Thea: The Awakening NOW. It´s absolutely worth the full asking price.","December 3, 2015","true","43.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

On top of that it has a unique crafting system that makes you sweat, as you need to search for the best resources to craft the best equipment (weapons, armour, trinkets, the usual)\n\nTo keep it simple: You have a single town that you control. No colonists/expansion. You only really need two resources: Food, and Fuel. Building choice is limited to less than 8 buildings. You may think this is absolute heresy, however you'll spend 90% of your time managing your "expeditions," than using your town. With these expeditions, you seek out resources, fight monsters, explore areas, and follow the story line. As there is more than one way to win, and more than one god to play as, this game has good replay value.\n\nWhy buy it: If you like a somewhat challenging game (even on normal) that requires patience, and has great (and sometimes snarky) dialogue, where instead of worry about resource management, you focus on crafting development and map exploration, this is your game.\n\nIf you're looking for a Civ clone, standard 4x, Banished or city-management, this is not for you, which is okay, hence why it's not listed as a "management" or "economy" game. This game won't scratch your Might and Magic, or Settlers itch, but it's unique enough that it'll satisfy a craving you didn't think you had, and quickly have you hooked.\n\nPS, to fully appreciate the depth of this game, ensure you read all the dialogue. The greatest trait this game has is an engrossing story/universe, and if you simply skip over it, you may find you don't enjoy it as much.","December 3, 2015","true","24.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The best way I can think of to describe it is a village-management rogue-like with progression across playthroughs. Also, heavy in the slavic mythology.\n\nThe first couple of playthroughs will probably end in death for your villagers. That's ok - your chosen god will gain XP with each new village you try (get to lvl 3 and you'll unlock another god to play with and get to lvl 3 etc.) Or stick with one god and max out the perks your villagers get.\n\nThe dev involvement seems very good. I had an issue with monitor resolution - I use one of the newer ultra-wide displays that's 2560x1080. One of the devs responded to my issue within hours. No fix on that one yet, but they are looking at it and I remain cautiously optimistic :o)","November 28, 2015","true","110.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is always encouraging to see new games that step outside of generic formulas. The issue of 4x games for me has always been about filling that middle of the game 'void'. The beginning and end of the game is normally exciting, but the inbetween is cumbersome.\n\nThea largely addresses this problem by continually giving you important choices to make throughout the game. You are constantly battling for survivial and always have immediate goals to work towards. Also, by making individual characters meaningful, battles become more significant and never lose their edge.\n\nI have found that towards the end of a game, if you are being overwhelmed, the ending of the game can be a long, drawn out process. I suggest that if you realise you are going to be wiped out, start a new game, rather than waiting for your village to die. Easier said than done... there is always this glimmer of hope that you might be able to find redemption.","December 3, 2015","true","11.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Simple up front, yet with decent depth of gameplay. Thea: The Awakening is a fantasy based sim with exploreable maps and an interesting storyline. It’s like playing a pick your own adventure book on a civilizations based map full of resources, runes, monsters and treasures with characters/villagers that have adjustable and craftable stats. Battles and challenges have a magic the gathering card based feel to them yet with more simple mechanics. You only have one settlement, but if your intelligence, will, magic or strength is high enough you can do some crazy things. I've actually traded my human settlers for Orc warriors using advanced social skills, I've talked a werewolf into sharing his silver with me (he was using it to build an immunity to silver) rather than fighting him and his pack to the death, I've had my villagers become knights for an Arthurian based quest, and more. This is a great gem of an indie game and worth picking up for casual gamers and hardcore strategy/fantasy fans alike. The only comment I can say to the developers is that I wish there was a little more depth to the card based battles which offered a bit more customizable strategy. They do get a little repetitive after a while even if there are a variety of challenges/battles (they are all essentially the same). If the card game was more like the Witcher 3’s card based game I think that would be better. Likewise, only having one village gets annoying on large maps. It would be nice to be able to colonize or have the option to establish at least one or two more villages; or incorporate other races’ villages as your own in an alliance. Creating halfbreeds between races and allowing a family tree to control in your small village would be interesting as well. Let sauce up the cabbage patch a bit shall we?

Pick it up, as I haven’t played a game this unique in a while.\n\nPros:\n-Everything meshes well, from inventory management to exploration to resource gathering, you really get engrossed with the mechanics while trying to win.\n-Great artwork and art style.\n-The card game is challenging and has enough depth to keep it fun, without being too time consuming and complicated to the extent that you'll get fatigue from the number of encounters you'll have in the game.\n\nCons:  (I’m more writing this hoping the devs will gets some ideas how to make improvements)\n-The writing is subpar, oftentimes throwing walls of text at you or being sort of silly.  I haven't gotten much into the main quest, but I can't say I'm very interested in the story, just more into the gameplay itself as you try to complete it.  Sometimes individual encounters will have interesting folklore or mythology to it (the game is inspired by Slavic mythology apparently) but in general I would have preferred a more concise text based storyline and a better story in general.\n-The “skull” system for giving you an idea how difficult an encounter could be needs some work in my opinion.  I’d much rather have a statistic screen showing me the likelihood of outcomes (i.e. % chance you’ll win, % chance you’ll win but a party member will be gravely wounded, % chance you’ll lose etc.)  In addition, the skulls don’t really give you a good prediction of the difficulty of enemies you’ll be fighting.  I might not have played enough to see the patterns better, but a 3 skull fight sometimes surprises me as a cake walk while another 3 skull fight throws creatures at me that will guarantee to kill my entire party.\n-The U.I. is in general good, but the most “busy work” time seems to be when you’re adding and comparing equipment for your individual villagers.  It needs streamlining, for instance: when I have a villager selected and look over a weapon in the general inventory I should get a box that appears that compares that item with what he has currently equipped instead of having to individually hover over each item to determine stats.  Another aspect is that all the stats numbers for characters seem to be jumbled on the screen instead of alphabetized, so the attack power of one character will be on a random spot on his stat screen that’s different from another character’s position.  In addition the production screen will state you have enough material to build a certain item when you in fact don’t, as 3 different items of the same type can’t be combined to produce something.  Though these seem kind of nitpicky, for a game like this small U.I. difficulties really add up the “busy work” time wasted.  I hope to see some of this updated in the future.\n-For a game that forces you to only have 1 village, the village maintenance mechanic is fairly Vanilla.  I would like a way for you village to expand its gathering zone (while having some way to keep it balanced) as well as having different options for buildings.  Right now, you have only a few options for buildings (with a 10 building cap), and you destroy and rebuild the same buildings just with different parts to try and get a bit better buffs.\n","February 28","true","43.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I've gotten 76 hours out of this game so far, more so than many other AAA games that are 3x the price.\nI do have some gripes though, there seem to be some performance issues in the late game, which I presume are due to the high number of enemies on the map, villagers and items. It's not a big issue, but a bit annoying since the frames dip from time to time.\nMy only other gripe is that the difficulty curve is a bit off, the game starts off as being pretty difficult, you have to struggle to survive, but later on when you start crafting higher tier equipment and your villagers get a bit higher up in level, the game becomes progressively less difficult.\n\nBut those negative points are counterbalanced by the fantastic music, great art and most importantly, the very fun gameplay. I can't describe it any other way than 'you'll lose track of time' when playing this.\n\nOverall I'm very impressed with this game, can't wait for MuHa to add more content and expand upon what they currently have.","March 1","true","87.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Good tutorials, tons of replay value.  Very skill based and a good difficulty scale to use as you get better.  The only two complaints:\n\n1. UI needs work.  I need to be able to sort and filter my characters and items better than the current system.  Sometimes I spend 20 mins just re-distrubuting my items to my characters when it could have taken less than 5 with a better sorting system.\n2. Game kills your children too easily.  Some events literally just say "Oops, 4 of your kids died".  No skills involved, no card game to play.  They are just dead.  Game seems to do this more often when you have lots of kids.  Don't get me wrong, I love how the random events keep you on your toes.  But no even should say "X is now dead" without you getting a chance to make decisions/fight for them.\n\nMinor annoyence: Game often quits taking itself seriously and throws in too much modren day humor.  I like the imersion Thea brings, I don't see the point in breaking it so often.\n\nOtherwise no complaints.  It's in a genre all on it's own and it's fantastic.","April 19","true","123.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

For example, units can gather resources more quickly if they have baskets, but to build baskets might require a material you don't see on the map.  So there's some frustration to try to find that resource.\n\nSending expeditions into the wild, they will encounter fights with the local wildlife and a cardgame creates a 1 dimensional (line) battle that becomes the majority of gameplay.  The fights are more interesting than I expected.  Units can be equipped with armor/weapons found in the field or crafted, and where the strongest units are placed can allow meat shielding with weaker units to allow a stronger unit to survive longer.\n\nThere are variations on the standard "fight" card battles.  I just did a "everyone has a hangover from drinking too much alcohol, so they must all fight the hangover" battle!  Significant effort went into making about a dozen or so different forms of battles - so it's not all armor and dexterity and strength.  It throws enough of a twist into the game to keep it very fresh and foreign to RPG players.\n\nAdd to all that some very good dramatic openning stories and quests generated on the map or in towns, and the gameplay has wide variation that doesn't stagnate.\n\nThe stories are well written and engaging.  The stories provide multiple choice dialog but they are still very short.  That quality starts to push this game into the educational domain - the concepts provided in the stories are ethical, and provide good food for thought.  So far all the writing I've encountered has been uplifting.\n\nIt's almost like the game is a "choose your own adventure" story, stretched out with challenging gameplay. I _always_ leave that one character trapped, but I wonder how it would play out if I freed them instead.  There are plenty of "make a deal with the devil" scenarios.\n\nThe voice acting is really good with one small exception.  I notce good voice acting, and even more so bad voice acting, and this game gets it right for the most part.\n\nDon't be fooled by the review or even the videos.  This is a Grand strategy 4x experience.\n\nMy main complaint is the lack of multiple save-files - but it's not a big deal after playing a while.  Though I can imagine trying a map, liking it, and wanting to play it again, but that is not supported by the UI (though it might be an option by saving files from the operating system).  The devs claim this is doable, so it might be available in an update (I wouldn't be suprised).\n\nThere is some tedium of micromanagement around 100 turns in, clicking the same stuff over and over every single turn or so.","May 4","true","66.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But that is really not a sufficient review so let me explain a bit why I enjoy the game and recommend it.\n\nPositive:\nI don't know many games (in fact none) that is focused on the slavic mythology with its pantheon and dark creatures and in my opinion it is lovely adapted into this game\nThe story makes sense and although not perfectly explaining everything still combines the gameplay with the characters etc.\nThings can turn pretty bad quickly for you if you are not careful in how you proceed. E.g. if you just go out carelessly and leave only farmers and craftsmen in your village then they might die when the village is attacked  but on the other hand you HAVE TO move out to find new resources, food or items.\nI like the pictures made for the characters and monsters but also for the items. You can see a lot of love for the game and the details there.\nThat is also true for the lore they wrote and the texts they wrote. You learn a lot about different creatures in the world and you can decide for yourself if you would like to negotiate with Orcs or if you just try to smash their skulls.\nYou have a big variety of food and items you can craft. Of course they have different values and there are probably only few items if you want to have maximum effect (important for the combat stats) but I just love the fact that I can cook and roast not only the mentioned Piroggi but also Leczno, Roastbeef, cooked vegetables, cooked fish, rabbit stew and a lot more (there are 3 ways how to prepare your food namely cooking, roasting and baking and I already have ~15 recipies without the baking I think). Also you have to find out what ingredients have what effect for the item. Yesterday I sat there 5 minutes just trying to find the best values between armor and a +stat for my new armor with what I currently have in stock thinking back and forth.\nPersonally I like the combat system because it is something different (you place your characters as cards, depending on their items and stats they will have different use in the fight) and you will have to think about your turn and what you want to do always with the risk of losing one or more of your important people.\nEven though the setting is dark and it is a hard game at times, you will still find little jokes or funny things in the game making you smile.\nThe replayability is high because you can unlock new abilities of your chosen god as well as unlock other gods of the pantheon for your next game. Each god has other strong points so it should change the difficulty and the way you play. I also think some quests change depending on your god (can't say that for sure as I am still in my first play-through)\nNegative:\nSometimes the game can be too hard because if you lose people in the beginning it will be tough to impossible to survive long enough. Later on after you have a critical mass of people you can afford to lose one or two. It'll set you back but you will survive. On the other hand thats why it calls itself a survival game as well I guess. And there is always the possibility to reload the save game.\nSometimes the combats can be a bit unfair as the fact if your "cards" are in the combat stack or the support (tactical) stack is based on chance just like the type of weapon of the enemy cards. It can be a big difference if they have big cards with just "sword damage" or if they have blunt or piercing weapon effects.\nI am not sure if it is planned to add more villages in the future  but so far you only have one village and you can't create more as the game progresses. Even though it is a post-apocalyptic setting (middle age style) I think it would be nice if there were other villages (blessed by the other gods e.g.) or if you could at least establish new ones later on.\nOverall I think it is a great game with a lot of love. So far I played around 30 hours and I am still playing my first play-through. Also I am certain that after that there will be another one with a different god. Also important to note is that there are still things being added (like the free dlc Return of the Giants) and bugs being fixed. But even in its current state the game is worth its 20€. the only thing you should ask yourself beforehand is: Is this the type of game I like where your decisions count and influence your progression? Maybe also watch a Let's Play before you buy it but if you are still interested afterwards you will have a game in which you can sink hours and hours. So far I had no crashes or progression stopping bugs. Maybe a spelling error once but thats about all I experienced so far.","April 27","true","31.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You pick a God which gives you way different quests and story in the game and also bonuses(playing through the game will level up the god and gives you more bonuses). combat is different, but once you figure it out, its pretty good. Saw a review who didnt like the combat, said it was too random, but unless you just cant figure it out or you are attacking dragons with a sharp stick its pretty straight foward and easy to plan and equip your group so they team well.\n\npros: fun game, very original and ton of different events, pretty good replay\nlot of different options in combat, not just fighting.\ncan get a lot of different types of creatures, demons, ghosts, goblins,orcs, elves, dwarves etc.\ncrafting is pretty good, does need more mats and building imo, but not too shabby atm\n\ncons: moving the map around is only done by arrow keys, would like to see it move with my mouse.\nauto combating bees can kill someone, which seems weird, at begining of game sure but at the end??\ni think replay is good, but main quest is the same everytime( each god though gets their own quest) would like to\nsee different ones where you dont know excatly what needs to be done from the start.\nAlso the village doesnt do much, just a spot to craft and drop off stuff needs more buildings or lets you have   a\nway to let you harvest different resources or food even.\n\n\nhas very few cons imo, at least nothing major. i give it a 8/10.\n","October 13, 2015","true","311.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

Deep lore and game mechanics, immediately difficult.\n\n\nI wish the developers created a more robust tutorial.  The game is pretty opaque and there is a ton of depth immediately upon starting, it could have benefited from a very simple learning campaign in which some of the complexity is reduced.  In two hours I have deduced that there are many onion layers of complexity under the hood and doing basic ♥♥♥♥ like outfitting your starting village for survival while you scout around is still fairly difficult.\n\nI am at ends with investing in learning it (would probably take a few more hours in which I'm not having fun, more of making mistakes and restarting).  Part of the issue is that the UI is very click based, but not intuitive.  I spent about 3 hours watching videos and reading about mechanics, and two hours playing the game.

This is a good thing and a bad thing at the same time.  A good thing as original thinking and ideas are very thin on the ground in the video game industry these days, so kudos in gratuitous amounts to the developers for that.  A bad thing as the developers are breaking virgin ground and whenever that happens a few unexpected sinkholes are bound to open up beneath them.  If I were to sum up the game in a few words I would say that it's a 4X game that has a couple of X's missing, that tries hard to be open world while directing you along a somewhat linear quest path.  See how confusing this is?\n\nSome clarification is in order.  4X stands for Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate.  Thea has the Explore and the Exploit part but is completely AWOL when it comes to the Expand & Exterminate.  Expand is missing as you only have a single village to look after with no mechanic available to settle new ones.  Exterminate is missing as there are no Ai opponents, just generic fantasy critters wandering around in groups that get tougher to beat as the turn count rises.  There are lairs that spawn these groups ( at least I think they spawn at the lairs ), so taking these out gives a little respite.  Then there are ruins to explore and numerous random events and encounters to either screw you over or give a boost.  As far as the 4X goes though, that's it.  The main game is supposed to revolve around you being a weakened deity trying to direct your last few followers so that you can reclaim your powers and save the world from the darkness ( shades of the neverending story ), seriously, the devs couldn't come up with something better than THE DARKNESS?  Sounds okay I suppose and at the start the game is interesting and keeps you engaged.  After a few hours though the sheen wears off and it devolves into boring inventory management, equipment swapping, gathering, etc. while you attempt to put together an expedition hard enough to take on the next part of the main quest.  Combat comes down to a card mini-game that needs a major redesign as at the moment it is barely fit for purpose and quickly gets bloated with large groups.\n\nThe game as it stands feels like an unfinished, early access offering that still needs a few mechanics adding to it, but these developers are trying to break new ground while being very active, which is a brave thing to do in the current market.  The game receives regular updates and I am recommending it as new thinking in the industry deserves to be supported.  Thea has huge potential ( how many times have we heard that before ) and my hope is that these devs will polish that hidden gem.\n","December 11, 2015","true","22.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

An RPG element game with a card based battle system. Done before, and most of them are mediocre at best, with bland card combat, so I wasn't expecting much, but it got good reviews, so I might as well try.\n\nAm I glad I did... I cannot suggest this game enough.\n\nThea: The Awakening puts you into a darkened world,  where the underworld has leaked into the world. Consuming, and darkening everything it touches. You're task is to survive, and take your small band of people into an adventure to reverse this.\n\nThe game itself is beautifully balanced, with an awesome music track that sets the tone, and feel to the rest of the game and art style.\n\nManaging your people and town\n\nUnlike other 4x games, this one truly makes you feel like you're struggling to survive in a world that's quickly falling apart, and turning on you.\n\nYou start with a small village with only a few people, and a few warriors. The Gatherers gather the goods around the town, the crafters make whatever it is you sent them to do, and the warriors of course protect them. However, what sets this apart from most 4x games, is that again, it's set to feel like you're a small band of people struggling to survive.\n\nResources are scarce, your village influence range around your town does not expand, and you don't build new towns either. To properly gather the resources you need to build things, you will need to make adventurer parties with a few warriors, and gatherers, maybe a witch and healer, and find the resources you need, setup camp, and gather, then bring them back to your village.\n\nCrafting and your people\n\nIn Thea: The Awakening each person is their own. You can give them equipment, see their individual stats, and what makes them them. As I mentioned before, resources are scarce, and rare, and therefore planning is needed for the future of your people. Who's going to be what, and where are they going to be going. A gatherer you plan to bring out in an expedition for resources will need better protection than a pitch fork and shirt.\n\nAnother wonderful addition to the game is the kids. Kids will randomly appear and be born, who will then grow into adults. Once they hit adult hood you can choose if they will be a warrior, crafter, or gatherer. On a random RNG roll you may also get a special option of something else, such as a witch, medic or one of the other specialties. These are rare however so you can't plan on them, but are always a welcome addition.\n\nThe fact the game simulates a true hardship of surviving in a dieing world being overtaken by darkness, the death of any of your members can be a real blow. Deaths are permenant, and you will need to bolster your ranks should you lose someone. They will take time to level up, grow, and become strong like the one you lost.\n\nThis to me is a very welcome addition as well over other 4x games where a loss is no big deal and "I'll just make another one". In this game, just waiting for a new kid to gain a new warrior is only a band aid on the warrior or high experienced member you lost.\n\n\nBattle System\n\nThe battle system is card based, however there are multiple ways to "fight" depending on the situation, and party members. Hunts, Negotiations, Hex's, Combat, are just a few. Each type of "Battle" determines your members cards stats, depending on the type of battle it is.\n\nThis is very important when constructing a party, and just adds to the depth of RPG element to the game. If you build a party with nothing but warriors, and you attempt to hunt, or negotiate your way out of a situation, you'll find your cards suddenly have no damage, and little health, because the stats are not going off of strength, weapons, armors, and  health, but instead off of speech, and mind of that particular person.\n\nThe card battle system itself is very well setup, and has quite alot of strategy and depth once you get into it, and understand all its aspects. Different weapon types, armors, etc. all effect the battle, and the card of that person in battle, and may even give them special abilities.\n\nDamage taken in the battles is realistically simulated outside of the fight. The lower health your member is after the battle, the more chance the bleeding will be severe enough for them to die from their wounds if you aren't careful. Every turn there's a chance they don't heal, and instead lose health. This can be countered by camping the party, and making sure you have enough fuel(wood) and food to properly tend to them. However if they got out of the fight with only a few hitpoints remaining, there's still a small chance you could lose them.\n\nConclusion\n\nThea: The Awakening is a great RPG game, with a real feel of conflict, and struggle in a dark world. The smaller size of your settlement, and party allows you get a connection with your people in a way, as you grow them, and give them equipmnt, and give them a spot in the society you're building. Watching one die can be a real blow in many ways, as you dishearteningly replace them with a new member who just grew to age.\n\nOne big mis step could see your entire party quickly hastening from a very dangerous area as they struggle to make it back to the village after a brutal battle, bleeding, and desperately low on health, unable to make camp due to the number of hostile enemies surrounding them, as turn after turn a few more die along the way, just hoping you can make it back to the village to save the rest.","December 22, 2015","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even after playing through it several times, you'll still find new ways to play through story events and combat, based on your current playthrough. The story events are all of a folklore or superstition theme, which can prove to be very rewarding if you're clever enough to understand them, or bewildering when that exact same cleverness gets you into trouble because you misinterpretted the event. Game instances can be long and methodical, or short and full of risk; regardless of whether you win or lose, you'll make progress toward future games thanks to every playthrough levelling your god, so feel free to experiment just to see what happens.\n\nWith that said, iteration isn't one of this game's strongest points. Games can run quite long, and the tech tree can be a real slog to progress through -- especially if you just want to experience all the story events, but keep finding yourself up against opponents that endanger your key villagers. There's also a lot of inventory management if you're the pack rat type that wants to collect ALL the resources. However, once you're far enough into your current game, these issues tend to lessen as your resource needs become more specific, and your villagers become increasingly capable.\n\nAll in all, Thea: The Awakening is quite a lot of fun.","January 26","true","206.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can tell it was a labour of love, and that the developer's put a lot of thought into mechanics and gameplay.\n\n\nDespite the amount of effort they've put in though, they slacked on one key detail: UI.\n\nI've found that my major frustrations rarely, if ever, come from gameplay mistakes. It comes from navigating menu after menu to do simple tasks like analyze my party's equipment and stats. You have to constantly switch items between parties, click through each and every party member to see their equipment, there is no 'skip animation' setting for the combat, which can get drawn out and annoying after a while. 'Overview' menus for equipment and stats (a menu JUST for party stats would be great, actually), combining inventory and equipment.\n\nThe gist of it is: streamline menus. The combat can be dicey for some people, but I really enjoy it. The lore is really well done. Graphics are on par with a normal 4x game, audio could use a little more variety.

An RPG element game with a card based battle system. Done before, and most of them are mediocre at best, with bland card combat, so I wasn't expecting much, but it got good reviews, so I might as well try.\n\nAm I glad I did... I cannot suggest this game enough.\n\nThea: The Awakening puts you into a darkened world,  where the underworld has leaked into the world. Consuming, and darkening everything it touches. You're task is to survive, and take your small band of people into an adventure to reverse this.\n\nThe game itself is beautifully balanced, with an awesome music track that sets the tone, and feel to the rest of the game and art style.\n\nManaging your people and town\n\nUnlike other 4x games, this one truly makes you feel like you're struggling to survive in a world that's quickly falling apart, and turning on you.\n\nYou start with a small village with only a few people, and a few warriors. The Gatherers gather the goods around the town, the crafters make whatever it is you sent them to do, and the warriors of course protect them. However, what sets this apart from most 4x games, is that again, it's set to feel like you're a small band of people struggling to survive.\n\nResources are scarce, your village influence range around your town does not expand, and you don't build new towns either. To properly gather the resources you need to build things, you will need to make adventurer parties with a few warriors, and gatherers, maybe a witch and healer, and find the resources you need, setup camp, and gather, then bring them back to your village.\n\nCrafting and your people\n\nIn Thea: The Awakening each person is their own. You can give them equipment, see their individual stats, and what makes them them. As I mentioned before, resources are scarce, and rare, and therefore planning is needed for the future of your people. Who's going to be what, and where are they going to be going. A gatherer you plan to bring out in an expedition for resources will need better protection than a pitch fork and shirt.\n\nAnother wonderful addition to the game is the kids. Kids will randomly appear and be born, who will then grow into adults. Once they hit adult hood you can choose if they will be a warrior, crafter, or gatherer. On a random RNG roll you may also get a special option of something else, such as a witch, medic or one of the other specialties. These are rare however so you can't plan on them, but are always a welcome addition.\n\nThe fact the game simulates a true hardship of surviving in a dieing world being overtaken by darkness, the death of any of your members can be a real blow. Deaths are permenant, and you will need to bolster your ranks should you lose someone. They will take time to level up, grow, and become strong like the one you lost.\n\nThis to me is a very welcome addition as well over other 4x games where a loss is no big deal and "I'll just make another one". In this game, just waiting for a new kid to gain a new warrior is only a band aid on the warrior or high experienced member you lost.\n\n\nBattle System\n\nThe battle system is card based, however there are multiple ways to "fight" depending on the situation, and party members. Hunts, Negotiations, Hex's, Combat, are just a few. Each type of "Battle" determines your members cards stats, depending on the type of battle it is.\n\nThis is very important when constructing a party, and just adds to the depth of RPG element to the game. If you build a party with nothing but warriors, and you attempt to hunt, or negotiate your way out of a situation, you'll find your cards suddenly have no damage, and little health, because the stats are not going off of strength, weapons, armors, and  health, but instead off of speech, and mind of that particular person.\n\nThe card battle system itself is very well setup, and has quite alot of strategy and depth once you get into it, and understand all its aspects. Different weapon types, armors, etc. all effect the battle, and the card of that person in battle, and may even give them special abilities.\n\nDamage taken in the battles is realistically simulated outside of the fight. The lower health your member is after the battle, the more chance the bleeding will be severe enough for them to die from their wounds if you aren't careful. Every turn there's a chance they don't heal, and instead lose health. This can be countered by camping the party, and making sure you have enough fuel(wood) and food to properly tend to them. However if they got out of the fight with only a few hitpoints remaining, there's still a small chance you could lose them.\n\nConclusion\n\nThea: The Awakening is a great RPG game, with a real feel of conflict, and struggle in a dark world. The smaller size of your settlement, and party allows you get a connection with your people in a way, as you grow them, and give them equipmnt, and give them a spot in the society you're building. Watching one die can be a real blow in many ways, as you dishearteningly replace them with a new member who just grew to age.\n\nOne big mis step could see your entire party quickly hastening from a very dangerous area as they struggle to make it back to the village after a brutal battle, bleeding, and desperately low on health, unable to make camp due to the number of hostile enemies surrounding them, as turn after turn a few more die along the way, just hoping you can make it back to the village to save the rest.","December 22, 2015","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After seeing it has a great potential and a great future ahead I've waited a bit more to see what will developers do about it and here what I saw; (+ Pros and Cons)\nDevelopers are in aware of this "potential" and they are releasing tons of fixes/new features once or twice a week. As far as I know some translations are on the way and they are working on a "free" dlc which will add a lot of new event and depth to the game + They are working on some kind of "Event Generator". They do read "requests" and give an answer to it directly on discussion forum (+ Facebook page).\nPros;\n+THE ART. Directly to the point. As a person who loves art (not the modern art) I loved character design and the events' artwork, not to mention musics of this game. This is a big plus for me.\n+Depth. Despite of it's simple look Thea is actually really complex. You are in control of a village as a god. You have to know every villager's personality. (With personality I mean Strenght / Attractiveness / Speech ... 20+ more detail.)\n+Thea has great graphics. But I think it will be much better as the time goes.\n+Thea has a great story (I nearly read all of those events). I don't want to spoil it so I recommend you experience it on your own.\n+Thea has easy controls "Space" to swap between expeditions and town. Hold right click to move units, w a s d to move camera, simple click to end turn...\n+Other minimal details.\nNeutral;\n±You learn that "Curiosity" is not a good thing the hard way.\nCons;\n-Nothing so far.\n\nTurkish ( Türkçe ) ;\n2 ay önce Thea'yı bir 15 saat oynayıp görüşlerimi yazmıştım. Sonra oyundaki potansiyeli ve parlak geleceği görünce bir yapımcılar bu konuda ne yapacak diye durdum ve gözlemledim. 2 aylık süre içinde yaptıkları; (+ oyunun "artıları ve eksileri")\nYapımcılar oyunun potansiyelinin farkında ve bir veya iki haftada bir içinde bolca düzeltme/yeni içerikler bulunan güncellemelerle oyunu zenginleştiriyorlar. Bildiğim kadarıyla oyunun için de Türkçe'nin de bulunduğu birçok çevirisi yapılıyor ve yapımcılar oyuna farklı bir perspektif ve derinlik kazandıracak  bedava bir eklenti paketinin de yapılma aşamasında olduğunu duyurdu. + Oyuna kişilerin kendi hikayelerini katabileceği türde bir "Event Editör"ünün de ekleneceği bildirildi. Ayrıyeten yapımcılar istekler konusunda çok hassaslar forumda / facebook sayfasında çok hızlı cevap verip çok hızlı bir şekilde "yapabiliyorlarsa" isteklerinizin oyuna entegre edilmesini sağlıyorlar.\nArtıları;\n+Sanat. Direkt olarak göze ilk çarpan benimde bayıldığım tarafı. Karakter dizaynları, çoğu eventin eşsiz çizimi resmen sanat. Müziğinin tadından da yenmediğinden bahsetmeme gerek yok.\n+Derinlik. Oyunun basit görünüşüne nazaran çok daha karmaşık bir mekaniğe sahip olduğunu belirtmeliyim. Bir tanrı olarak ufak bir köyü yönetiyorsunuz ve köylülerin kişiliklerini iyi bilmeniz gerekiyor. (Kişilikten kastım da "Güçleri , Çekicilikleri, konuşma kabiliyetleri ve 20'den fazla başka özellikleri.)\n+Oyunun grafikleri iyi. Zamanla daha da iyi olacağını ümit ediyorum.\n+Thea'nın kontrolleri de basit. Boşluk tuşuna bas ekibin / köyün arasında geçiş yap. Sağ klikle ekipleri yürüt , w a s d ile ekranı oynat sol klikle turu geç falan.\n+Diğer ufak detaylar.\nNörtler;\n±Oyun "merak" duygusunun çok da iyi bir şey olmadığını sert bir şekilde öğretiyor.\nEksileri;\n-Açıkçası daha çok eksilik bir şey göremedim.","January 14","true","41.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is seriously too much to talk about. So I\'ll try to briefly cover the main parts.\n\nThere are a lot of characters, each with unique portrates and all with varying degrees of skill. There are many different types of character: There are at least 5, if not 6 different races. Each race has multiple types of character. For example, humans might have Hunters, Bandits, Workers, Craftsmen, Warriors and Witches/Wise Men whereas goblins might have Boar Riders, Skirmishers, Shamen and so on. You can even recruit some beasts like the ones you commonly fight!\n\nEquipment and Buildings! They work in a similar fasion to the Borderlands games, where each piece of equipment is made up of different parts that affect it\'s final stats. The only thing is that the system is far far simpiler, with only two component pieces per item, one primary and one secondary component. The order of the components changes the weapon too, so the main componant will give the weapon it\'s base stats and its\' appearence while the second would usually impact the general quality of the item and occasionally add a boost to the second component\'s associated skill. The amount of combinations mean that you can find all sorts of varients for just one weapon.\nThe weapon stats themselves are very easy to understand but also complex enough for you to really get into designing your whole group. For example, your wise old man isn\'t going to be able to carry much, so while you might be able to make an absolute slab of a sword out of pure moon-stone that would wreck anyone, he probably can\'t lift the damn thing. So you probably want to find some dryad wood, the lightest building material for swords, and craft a less powerful but much lighter sword out of that.\n\nAuto-resolve: Awwwww, yis.\nI could just leave it like that but for the benefit of those paranoid of the auto-resolve option wiping their best team, I\'ll continue.\n\nThe auto-resolve option the game gives you is actually really fair. For the most part it will make the right call and your overpowered guys will trump the slightly less overpowered enemies. When you first start out and you\'ve got no idea what stats affect what or how to play your cards to win, the auto-resolve function is your best friend. Once you get into the game and you get an idea of what you\'re doing you\'ll want to take the harder battles yourself, but you\'ll still use the auto-resolve function all the time for a number of things. I like to view it as a trust-worthy second in command. I\'m crap at fighting large numbers of enemies. One or two dragons? Easy! Seventeen wolfs, rats, bees or a mixture of the above? I\'m done. Party wiped and pride shattered. However, my trusty second in command is far better at dealing with poor quality, large quantity enemies than I am, so I let him take command for those fights. Usually works out pretty well!\nIt\'s also great for just skipping any low level enemies that insist on fighting you.\n\nStory! I\'ll keep this bit short because you can\'t really go into detail without ruining it with spoilers, but the story is excellent. Both for the main campaign, the Giants campaign and for the general random events. The choice system is diverse and rewards you differently but appropriately for the apporaches you chose. You also get different options revealed to you depending on your party. For example, in one case you might be able to use brute strength to carve out some silver from a mine using just the rocks around it, or if you have tools with you then you can do a much easier challenge for the same, or a better, reward. Planning ahead is definitely rewarded and it\'s always good to keep your people well equipped.\n\nThat pretty much rounds up the main parts. There\'s still picking the different Gods to play as, the gathering system, the technology tree, the food and fuel system and many other parts.\n\nJust get it. Get it and then figure out the rest as you play. It\'ll definitely be worth it!","June 1","true","105.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you like games like Fallen Enchantress and Age of Wonders, you will love this.\n\nPROS\n+ Perfect blend of 4X, Rogue-like, and RPG\n+ Highly customizable world set up (optional Save feature a major plus)\n+ Tons of varied and interesting quests and events\n+ Each villager's equipment and job can be assigned\n+ Tons of weapons, armor, items and character skills\n+ Multiple selectable dieties with upgradeable powers increases replayability\n+ Decent tutorial system helps explain more complex features\n+ Definitely has that "just one more turn" appeal (very fun)\n\nCONS\n- One city with only a handful of upgrades may seem limiting at first\n- Equipment/Item management can be time consuming (needs better way to compare items)\n- Event/Battle card system is complex (but totally skippable)\n- Interface can be difficult to read at times\n- Isn't always clear what certain skills do\n- Definitely has that "just one more turn" appeal (time sink)","November 27, 2015","true","104.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Explore the world to find better equipment, food, and resources, to fend off enemies coming to your doors. No two games are the same. Manage everything carefully, your items, your people, your materials, navigate your way wisely out of semirandom events while you try to discover what happened to the world. If you blink, your people may die.\n\nCHECKLIST==========\nThea filled the big hole in my heart left by games I played in my youth like Colonization. Let's go through a checklist:\n--You must manage over 20 different resources, CHECK.\n--There's an immediate threat to your survival, you can't slack off, CHECK\n--You can craft over a hundred different items, CHECK (and thousands if you factor in combinatorics, DOUBLE CHECK)\n--The game punishes you for your mistakes and rewards you for what you did well, CHECK\n--You can play iron man (no saving) by toggling a difficulty setting (that is, by design), CHECK\n--There's music and it doesn't suck, it helps immersion, CHECK\n--The art is good, it also helps with immersion. I specially praise the looks of the UI, the item icons, and the portraits, CHECK\n--Asymmetrical AI: you don't fight equal opponents, you fight for survival in a hostile world, CHECK\n--Deep, rich event system, with over a hundred different events that adapts to your party composition, their inventory, their deeds, all of it, CHECK\n--There is more than one way to resolve conflict, you can avoid using violence, you can reason, you can use lateral thinking, the game allos you to play your way and tell yourself your own story. DOUBLE CHECK.\n--Immense replayability given how many different things the game has that you won't see in your first playthrough, CHECK\n--A research net with MEANINGFUL CHOICES that don't suck, DOUBLE CHECK\n--The game has magic, but a subtle, difficult to access sort of magic, just like in King of Dragon Pass. It's not the overdone, everpresent magic of High Fantasy JRPGs. CHECK\n--You can't just cast spells to "heal" your wounds, and they don't automatically heal after a fight. Wounds are there to stay and they take long to heal, and they may kill your people. CHECK.\n--You can starve, you can die of sickness, of poisons, of curses, kidnapping, and of course good old combat death, CHECK.\n--Every single person counts. Your people are not a disposable resource that you can easily regenerate. CHECK\n\nPERSONAL APPRECIATION============\nThe game is the dreamed mix of genres that I always wanted to play. It combines resource management, with survival, with 4X games, with the incredible event system of King of Dragon Pass. I was waiting for a game like this, I was looking for it far and wide and I couldn't find anything that filled the big resource-management-shaped hole in my heart. Then a friend showed me this game, and I said "but it's Windows only!", and it turns out the developers released a Linux version, unsupported, but still, they did it!; that won me over and I tried the game.\n\nThis game is what I wanted. I talked so much to friends about it, about the things I wanted in a game, and I found them all here. It's the game I wished for!, I got my wish!, straight from a video game genie.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?, this game defies genre classifications, it's its own thing, it's a mixture of everything you love. If you are like me, you will look forward to spending a thousand hours playing.\n\nI look forward to playing a thousand hours.\n\n10/10\nIf we gave 10 only to perfect games, no game would get a 10. This game is all it needs to be, the rest would just bring the score up to 11.\n\nRECOMMENDED.","November 27, 2015","true","203.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Another part that I loved was the uniqueness of characters, their own art syles, and their proficiencies, everyone is different and they all grow in their own unique way. Also im a big fan of survival RPG games and this game really hit the spot for me by bringing a variety of stories that actually progressed or hindered your ability to survive against so many different possibilities. Lastly, there is the part about the UI, I think it could still use a little work but I havent really played a game that is unique as this one. Theres a bit you have to get use to but its like any other "4X" game, reason being is that they offer so much to the game it probably makes it hard to make it flush out nicely, but I wouldnt let that discourage you, I quickly learned it and was glued to the game all day on my day off.\n\nNow for a few parts of the game that I didnt care for.\n\nOne of my biggest concerns was that I felt like the game grew more difficult the more you barely progressed, maybe I suck at playing the game, wouldnt doubt it, but I felt like once I got to a certain point I just had a bunch of higher level guys thrown at me while im still a lower level. Another thing would be is trying to find more people to join you in the game, I would rescue or raise someone and soon after I would lose a guy or two. Finally, I wish I was able to either or- make more settlements, have growing domain range, or atleast be able to set up a middle man to run between my base and camps if possible.\n\nLike I said I probably just suck at playing the game but I feel like some people would agree with me on a few points. I dont know wether the team will come out with those in later patches or not, but even with all that said I still really loved the game they made and I would definetly recommend this game to people who like RPGs, 4X games, or to whoever was looking for a new kind of game that feels different than the others.","November 22, 2015","true","26.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I ended up recruit 3 Elves, 1 Demon, 5 Hunters, 1 Sage, and 1 Witch. Not to mention my other standard guys. I was able to beat the entire main quest fairly easy, (mind you this was on normal).  MY main method was Social/Hunting/Attack. While there were other ways to overcome obstacles these became the most powerful as things like magic or hexing / sneaking become really hard to stack as you need specific character types.\n\nWhile there were a few instances I felt confused such as the attack order which is used for every conflict resolution; sometimes its predictable who the enemy will attack so you can strategize; other times its just hectic.\n\nThe dialouge is ok; the story telling is nice; there are a few quests that are empty that will probably be filled later.\n\nIn the end; the crafting was very rewarding as was the gathering.\nBut the thing that I felt the game lacked was village options. Such as expanding my village to include more tiles; or being able to terra-form tiles; such as making a tile near your base wheat. Also; being able to found a new village or repair an abandoned village. Or traded with another village; as many of the tiles in the game can only be triggered once or for specific reasons like lifting a curse but it doesnt have the shops or traders that you can frequent that arent temporary.\n\nIn the end; this has potential and I honestly feel like this would be the template for an incredible FTP online game similar to Travian. But as it is a Solo-P at the moment the idea is brilliant and I cant help but feel like 15.99 was a complete steal.\n\nRECOMMEND!","November 23, 2015","true","71.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I LOVE strategy games, and this one is unlike most I have played.\nPROS:\nGood story. The events that happen are constantly changing and have different outcomes.\nLeveling up and equiping my teams with great gear has become an addiction, and despite the world being small, there's a ton to do.\nThe game is tough, even when played on easy novice, but not too tough that you don't want to play. Just tough enough that you aren't bored.\nGetting the hang of the game is quite easy, and is done in the first hour, but mastering this game could take ages.\n\nCONS:\nNo save, other than an autosave every 5 turns, which is super annoying for someone like me, who hates every negative outcome or the death of a person. *** I have been informed there is a save feature by one of the developers. You have to change the settings before you start playing the game to turn on saves, and then, while playing, you press esc to access the menu that allows you to save. You can NOT turn on saves after you have been playing, it has to be done before you start a game (which still makes it a con in my book)****\nEvery time I die and reload (and sit through a two minute load screen), the tutorial popups start over at the beginning. There's no way to turn them off without starting a new game, and losing the hours and hours of building my little town.\nThe battle screen is done in a card battle format, which is absolutely NOT for me. I just press "auto resolve" or I lose. AND sometimes they will give you a starting twon where the people you begin with all do literally no damage. You can't kill even the first mobs of the game.\nThey rate the enemies with a 1-5 skull toughness system, but it's very difficult to tell how many skulls your team can safely go up against.\n\nAll-in-all, I really like it. worth the cost, especially if you get it on sale.","March 2","true","81.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

I think this game should be much higher on the charts.\n\nThe game offers great replayability with its new map each time you play on top of you being able to set the difficulty of the game via several choices prior to launching a new game.\nYou have several gods to play, only a few at first but they unlock as you play more and more.\nIn the game you can craft items just like you want according to the resources you have at hand. There are no limits to the amount of people you can have in your community (had like 48 individuals in my last game at the end).\nThere are several ways to end the game, especially with the super hot update they have added lately. The giants are deadly, stay away from them unless you want to die or you have a party of at least 16 individuals with excellent gear and with an average level of 6 or higher.\nThe update also diversified the graphics, especially in the items department. This is superficial as graphics are not the drive of this game, it is the high replayability, but who would complain having a better looking game in the end?\n\nGreat game, to buy even at full price. Good lot of stuff in the game, and the designers seems to be interested in adding even more stuff... and if you try the game you'll realize that it has an almost infinite possibilities for expansions and big updates that adds things.\n\nOh! Did I mention that the game's universe is quite detailed and has good background. Most of it is read by a man, especially the important encounters and stories.\n\nThree Thumbs up! I think this game will be as good as Heroes of Might & Magic III if they continue to develop it even though it is not quite the same genre (turn-based and random maps yes, but those are the only similarities.).","April 23","true","49.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In essence, you play as a near-depowered god with barely a handful of followers left after the end of your world. You need to keep your followers alive, and lead them into the future.\n\nToo bad about the monsters, though.\nAnd the undead spirits...\nAnd the plagues and sicknesses...\nAnd the lack of food...\n\nWell. you get the idea.\nPros:\n-Card Game conflict means that there is an element of randomness in combat; what you draw determines your success.\n-Engaging story and wide world keep interest.\n-Wide variety of units and encounters make each game different.\n-Random number god relatively forgiving at lower levels, preventing excessive ragequits.\n\nCons-\n-Card game can become tedious, and auto-play feature can get valuble survivors killed.\n-Still in playtesting; the game is not as user friendly as it could be.\n\nI reccomend this game whole heartedly, but would encourage developers to make it more clear who is attacking whom during combat. This isn't always intutive when playing cards.\n\nOtherwise, excellent game for those who want to play slower games.","October 13, 2015","true","115.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Using your people as a card game, really enjoyable once you get the hang of it. The leveling for each god/goddess is nice, though easily gamed at the moment. But if expanded giving more depth and possibly attaching a skill tree to each, could make be something amazing (though that's just my opinion and shouldn't take anything from this game and how amazing it is even in early access).

This game does something right and that is having a strong compelling theme and reinforcing it with interesting game mechanics. The result is a very immersive game.\n\nYou play as a God trying to regain their powers in a world steeped in darkness. You control one small city with only a handful of villagers each with different roles such as gatherers, warriors and workers. You need to form expedition parties to scavenge the lands for resources and equipment. You'll need to defend your city and go on quests to build your powers. Meanwhile you deal with events that help or hinder you on the way. If a villager dies it's lost forever and rarely do you get new villagers joining your city. This makes you invested in your little group of villagers.\n\nThe game mechanics aren't perfect - the resource gathering, construction and crafting needs a bit of work. I found the sheer amount of resources but the one-dimensional ways of utilize them to be a bit uninteresting. The combat can get a bit boring as well as you tend to encounter hordes of uninteresting enemies. These are things that can be improved though.","October 12, 2015","true","23.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game came out the other side absolutely wonderful.\n\nFor starters:\nI stole children from Orcs and gave them to a Demon so that Demon would go on a date with a Dwarf. The Dwarf gave me sweet armor.\n\nShort, medium and long term goals are available almost instantly. Crafting inititally seems to be a "best" materials venture until you start to see different bonuses based on your desired play style. Almost every encounter can be navigated using your party strengths or preferences.  There is just so much to keep you busy, constantly upgrading, gathering, building, fighting, recruiting, researching, leveling all while engaging in a terrific underlying story line that waits for you. So much thought went into every aspect of this game and nothing feels like a toss away or unfulfilled concept. I am already looking forward to my next playthrough with new Gods, new weapons, new villagers and new structures.\n\nFor me, this game is what we all envision when we decide to back a game. The progression through early access the developer's continued responses to player feedback is what sold me on this game.

But everything adds one thing to the game either through randomness or depth: replayability.\nThere are a lot of ressources to discover, each one with unique abilitys. They are used in weapons, armor, tools and buildings which are getting different benefits depending on the material used to craft them. F.e.: A palisade out of gold attracts dwarfs to join your settlement, if it's made out of steel it attracts orcs instead; a weapon made out of blackwood gets a poison effect, if it's made out of obsidian it get's a bonus to stealth.\nSince the game is randomly generated you usually get different ressources with an easy access each playthrough so you can focus on different things each time, like getting a good chance to get demons to join your village or make a lot of armor which boosts your magic. There are a lot of different races and skills to get out of this. But you also have to do risky expeditions later on to get to the usually rare and powerful ressources. And since the game has a day and night cycle it's not always a good idea to venture too far.\nThe many skills you can get are used mostly for challenges, but each has a purpose: either offensive, defensive or as a support skill. These challenges are using a tactical cardbased mechanic which is neither too simple nor too complex, it's well thought out.\n\nThe Randomness the game has is not for everyone, you can get absolutely screwed sometimes, and sometimes it can be a little too easy, but that's exactly why i like it: you just don't know what you'll get and even if you feel strong you can loose unexpectedly or at least suffer a heavy defeat.\n\nThe Game does have some downsides so far, but that's expected in early access.\nThe UI does it's job, but definitely could benefit from a lot of comfort features like shift-clicking to equip/unequip something, a filter function for the expedition creation and so on.\nSpelling mistakes are relatively common, and after a while the fights against bees, crows etc. can get a little annoying. Also i think the endgame needs a little more balancing.\nBut that's nothing that can't be fixed before release.\n\n\nOtherwise the game runs very stable, i didn't had any crashes or gamebreaking bugs and only one annoying bug i can remember after 50 hours.\n\n\n\nIf you can deal with the randomness you can easily get your value out of this game.\n\nEdit after Release: They improved the UI and the hole game by a lot, the only thing i still don't like about this game is the tidious equipment management which can take a while, but other then that i don't have any complaint anymore.","October 11, 2015","true","101.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I hadn't been following it and the little I had read about it left me cold.  With so many incredible fantasy 4X games out there (Endless Legend, Age of Wonders 3, Sorceror King, etc) why would I play Thea?  It's a £15 game from a small development house - what really is this going to bring to the table?\n\nThen I read the review of the game on Explorminate and it was so glowing I thought I'd give it a quick look.  So I downloaded it.  That was over 80 turns and 4 hours ago!  I have not moved from my laptop since!\n\nThis game is absolutely fantastic.  The art style, the writing, the graphics, the exploration, the crafting, the quests, the customisation, the character of the world.  Everything is faultless.  It's even completely stable and runs like a dream.\n\nI was initially put off by Thea's card based challenge system which is used to resolve combat, social interactions and tricky situations.  Put even this is fun and tactical.  It's like Gwent on steroids.\n\nI really can't speak to highly of this game.  I get completely attached to my villagers as they join those already populating my settlement and become my best gatherers, warriors or craftsmen - only to meet their fate at the hands of a bear in a forest or undead skeleton in a dungeon.  Each loss is really felt.\n\nI could go on about this game but if you really want to know about it then read the review on Explorminate and then buy it.  Stick with it for an hour or so and initial confusion will give way to pure pleasure and one of the most original and engrossing gaming experiences in recent memory.  I am searching for a criticism of the game and can't really find one.  It's early days but this is one I think I'm going to be playing for a long time to come.","November 21, 2015","true","5.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The artwork's decent and has its own look, the concept isn't like other games I've played, the game really does fill a unique niche in my library.  The game offers replay value, there are different customizable options to increase difficulty &c.  Though a large roster means winning, there's still a question of *getting* there in the first place, then minimizing casualties even after that.  So all in all, well worth taking a look at.  The developers have stated they intend to address certain gameplay issues &c, so there's that too.","December 23, 2015","true","604.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is a pile of games out there to pick from and picking up an indie game above $10 is always a game for most people.\n\nIt's worth it. Civilization (more Legendary) meets RPG is selling it a bit short, but there is a lot of depth to this game and it does the vast majority of it it does well. Don't let the "card battle" thing lead to believe the encounters are boring. The easy encounters can be "auto resolved" to save time while the meaningful encounters will really work your brain. A vast array of skills and stats are all meaningful, which is a feat in it's self with great internal balancing thanks to the various approaches your parties can take on things.\n\nTo sum it up, buy the game because it's really well done and deserves a play.","December 28, 2015","true","76.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Can bring up a lot of dialog\n\nInbetweeners:\n\n• Limited to only one city, but with enough growth you can send out several expeditions or just one more to harvest the materials you need. I suppose this is reasonable due to the lore.. won't really find many settlements out there.\n• Your characters die a lot -- if you're good at playing, this is probably not a problem at all and you may even like it. But when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan you don't want your favorites to die, or maybe they just deserve it. Could use a casual mode.\n\nCons:\n• Sound effects are buggy, music can reset randomly and some sound effects are missing / copy pasted.. like, a start combat click among other things.\n• Graphics seem to be too pale for my liking, so I used that sweetFX mod.\n\nAll in all, pros outweigh the cons and since the game was recently released and the devs want to do more, I'd recommend this game.","November 28, 2015","true","37.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact I played around 20 hours by now.\n\n\nRating:\n====================\nSo far it is a beautiful and great game! It is complex and a fantastic mix of RPG and Survival. I love this game beside it's shortcomings I'll talk more about next. I refrain from repeating all the good that can be said about this game and has already been said hundredths of times here in the review section by others. If you want to know more about why exactly this game is so great please read theses reviews. If I could rate it by stars I would give it 4 stars out of 5. The fifth it would get if the following issues I have with the game would get fixed.\n\n\nConstructive Feedback:\n====================\n1. UI Shortcomings\n1.1. General UI Shortcomings\nThe UI is in dire need of some tweaking! The player has too much to click to get an overview and to do certain things. Another thing is the radial menu, it is often in the way of where I want to click leading to the click getting not recognized. Beside that I realized is that the UI is not consistent e.g. you can move your party via right click and drag but when you choose to move your party via the radial menu you have to left click on the target. One more thing that is irritating that you can't double click on things like towns and parties or whatever to open their dialogue windows like inventory and so on.\n1.2. Quest Information\nWhen hovering with the mouse over a quest marker on the map it should show a short quest description. Clicking on a quest marker on the map should open the quest window showing the latest information for that quest. Besides that the quest marker should indicate the difficulty of the quest like encounters are marked with skulls. Additionally the skull should be color coded for the different kind of fighting challenges so that the player can easily see that for example this one quest is a 3 skull social challenge and so on.\n2. Repetitive Art Usage\nCharacter portraits and character names get used repetitively leading to characters having the same name or character portrait. However, the user can at least change the name of the characters. Even better would be if a character name generator would be incorporated and if the user could use his own custom character portraits.","January 12","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is absolutely excellent, a refreshingly new entry to the 4X (3X?) genre. It's not like anything you've ever played before, it's a genre hybrid between a large-party questing RPG, a card-battle game and a 4X strategy sim; very cool. I would reccomend anyone buy it for that reason.\n\nThe voice acting is spectacular as well! It really emerses you in the game; it feels like a dungeon master.\n\nAlas, each new game is the same quests (though you can make different choices). With a very simple tech tree and limited class choices, you will play nearly the same game on each playthrough. Yes you unlock "Gods" but this is like unlocking a new Civ Team... Not particularly exciting enough to justify an additional playthrough if the map and enemy teams and quests were all identical.\n\nAll said, if you don't mind spending $20 for 20-30 hours of play like me - I can't reccomend it enough!","May 2","true","33.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It mixes so many playstyles so well. I'm so happy I picked it up on a whim.\n\nThe story is really underrated. For example:\n\nYou meet a group of Orcs at an abandoned vault. Fearful of one another due to old legends from your ancestors that the other race were child eating brutes, you pass a social/speech check to team up by sharing half of the loot. It's an inspiring story and the female Orc leader offers you a drink.\n\nBy letting go of their differences and participating with each other they were able to easily overcome their obstacle but also their hatred for one another.\n\nAs you open the vault door you are rewarded with the option: "Sharing is stupid, attack the Orcs!" then you mercilessly slaughter them. Which is absolutely hilarious and I loved it.\n\nOr, you can choose to share the spoils as promised. You sit down at a campfire with the Orc leader to divy up the goods. She says, "This was a trip to remember and I would not like it to go to waste on account of our mutual hatred. I will give you one of my men. ... In return, one of yours will come to live with us. Perhaps this way, we will learn about each other and rebuild our land differently from before."\n\nYou have major control on not just the story but the gameplay. You can skip/autocomplete the card game battles if you want and some wordy parts of the story itself with options such as "Yeah ok get on with it/Give me the point form version."\n\nI was pulled in with the familiar feeling gameplay but I'm really hooked on the story. It's surprisingly well written. You don't normally get this level of detail in a video game story. The graphics might make the game seem a little cheap at first but the more you play the game, the more it sucks you in.\n\nI bought Fallout 4 at launch but I completely forgot about it because of this game. I didn't think it was going to be this good!","November 28, 2015","true","140.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I DO enjoy this game. However, I recognise that not this game's market appeal is rather low.  Most people won't enjoy it because it is quite simply not accessible.\n\nThis game's main issue is that it has a stupidly large learning curve. It is that simple. There IS a tutorial available for the game, but the game is extremely poor at guiding you through the nuances of the mechanics and giving tips along the way on how to improve your play and keep villagers alive.  It really doesn't help that the game is on permament Iron Man  mode so you cannot take back moves and experiment with different approaches to the same problem.\n\nOnce you get over this learning curve however, the game suddenly becomes easy. Some folks say trivially easy.  Since I'm over that stupidly large learning curve, I'm now playing the game and I'm enjoying navigating my way through all the challenges and experimenting with different strategies.  So yes, in spite of the negative tone of this review, I actually recommend this game. It is a good game once you can get past the learning curve.\n\nRecommendation: Before you start a battle or any type of challenge, learn how the card battle system works exactly. Do not try to learn it on the fly. The game does a very poor job of explaining, yet the card battle is a core gameplay activity that is used to resolve all encounters.","March 12","true","184.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The artwork, story,  and music create a beautiful, engaging environment.   Thea has very unique game play.   I find that many RPG and 4x strategy games are overly complex and the process of learning the game not very enjoyable.   In Thea, you only have one villiage and one, or maybe two, adventure parties to manage unlike other 4X games where you may have 10 or more cities (planets, etc) to manange which soon becomes unwieldy.   This simplicity allows you to put more thought into the choices you are making in the game.     The technology tree is another example of where less is better.   The technology tree is relatively simple and intuitive compared to other 4x games that I have played.   But rather than making the game play simple, it makes your choices understandable and strategic.   FInally, I agree with those previous reviewers who like the card game system of combat.    It is refreshingly different from the Hex based squad combat that is ubiquitous.\n\nI highly recommend giving this game a try.","March 5","true","33.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm deeply impressed with the mechanics and how the game works. It's engaging, has replayability, and is overall a breath of fresh air.\n\nTips:\nI find my luck is much better with the gatherers. Not only do they bring in a hunting attribute, but they are also able to find vital rescources. Hunting saves me from a full frontal assault (and being maimed by a large rabbit).\n\nScouting is important, however staying close to the village in the start is more important. I can't tell you the number of times I've gone and veered off to a higher level to only be clobbered immensely. Quests, scouts, monsters, and other things will pop up so it's best to stay close to home.\n\nIf mortally wounded, ALWAYS camp immediately. Your chances of surviving increase dramatically.\n\nNote that loosing one member will not stunt you, but loosing too many can land lock you. You won't be able to go through terrain, move, or camp. Your members will die of hunger unless you are able to send help from the village.\n\nThe game ultimately works against you. If it's not dark dwarves stealing your gold or an ice queen frozen at heart, it's a problematic situation which you can't get out of. Diplomacy is your friend to most of the random situations. Attacking wisps and travelers will only get you killed.

Your people are your cards so there's no separate gathering of cards, it's just improving your people. Decent variety of how you tackle various missions. Tech tree broad enough that i can see replaying this several times to explore different strategies.\n\nOnly complaint I'd have is I wish more encounters had some easier path to solving. I'll have 4 different choices sometimes of how to tackle a fight, Combat, Sneak, Hunting, Sickness for example, but all 4 will almost all be the same difficulty. This at least helps promote focusing on one being fine, but it'd be nice if there was a clearer advantage against more opponents to do one over the others.","January 26","true","73.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

No two games are exactly the same due to all the random events and there is a lot of freedom to do what you want to do (although initially limited by resources and technology).  There seems to be a lot of room to expand upon the game such as building additional cities.  Trading, while present, seems limited.  The RPG aspects of the game are woven in very nicely and it is easy to get invested in your characters as they grow.  The card game used for encounters and challenge events takes getting used to but can help you get through situations where auto resolve might wipe your group.","March 23","true","28.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I DO enjoy this game. However, I recognise that not this game's market appeal is rather low.  Most people won't enjoy it because it is quite simply not accessible.\n\nThis game's main issue is that it has a stupidly large learning curve. It is that simple. There IS a tutorial available for the game, but the game is extremely poor at guiding you through the nuances of the mechanics and giving tips along the way on how to improve your play and keep villagers alive.  It really doesn't help that the game is on permament Iron Man  mode so you cannot take back moves and experiment with different approaches to the same problem.\n\nOnce you get over this learning curve however, the game suddenly becomes easy. Some folks say trivially easy.  Since I'm over that stupidly large learning curve, I'm now playing the game and I'm enjoying navigating my way through all the challenges and experimenting with different strategies.  So yes, in spite of the negative tone of this review, I actually recommend this game. It is a good game once you can get past the learning curve.\n\nRecommendation: Before you start a battle or any type of challenge, learn how the card battle system works exactly. Do not try to learn it on the fly. The game does a very poor job of explaining, yet the card battle is a core gameplay activity that is used to resolve all encounters.","March 12","true","184.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The artwork, story,  and music create a beautiful, engaging environment.   Thea has very unique game play.   I find that many RPG and 4x strategy games are overly complex and the process of learning the game not very enjoyable.   In Thea, you only have one villiage and one, or maybe two, adventure parties to manage unlike other 4X games where you may have 10 or more cities (planets, etc) to manange which soon becomes unwieldy.   This simplicity allows you to put more thought into the choices you are making in the game.     The technology tree is another example of where less is better.   The technology tree is relatively simple and intuitive compared to other 4x games that I have played.   But rather than making the game play simple, it makes your choices understandable and strategic.   FInally, I agree with those previous reviewers who like the card game system of combat.    It is refreshingly different from the Hex based squad combat that is ubiquitous.\n\nI highly recommend giving this game a try.","March 5","true","33.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its 4X fantasy game set in Slavic mythology. You play the role of a Slavic god guiding a few of the remaining humans in an attempt to restore your power. Researching opens the ability to farm resources which leads to the crafting of better items and weapons. Your town grows randomly, either by children growing into adults, visitors wanting to join your village, or sometimes, just because you rescued someone during an event. Not just humans either, you can get goblins, dwarves, even ghosts and demons! You expand by sending your people out on expeditions that can encounter events, complete quests, or simply gather resources for your next best weapon. My current game I have 5 expeditions now with a dozen peeps in each, all exploring and conquering different areas of the map. The exterminate part is a card game: its a brilliant, original idea. In fact, there are many different types of card games, not just combat, but also magic, hunting, sneaking, diplomacy to name some - and you can auto-resolve. There are many quests that you can follow, or choose to ignore if you want. The events add a role playing aspect to the game - and they are narrated. There is a nice event editor that MUHA provided graciously for free. The devs are very active in responding to emails and fixing bugs. One bug I reported, they fixed and I had the patch within an hour on a Saturday. They are also very willing to discuss enhancements to make their game better. I have spent 162 hours in game and counting. Its not getting old. And a really cool part is it doesnt matter if you win or loose your current game: when the game completes, it adds all the experience to a running total, which increases your ability as a Slavic god. I've played several games now and Veles (the god I have played in the previous game) is up to level 3 - as an example. There are several other gods to choose from, each with their own bonuses, and you can swap between them as much as you want. Its a really cool, inventive approach to a game. Very original. I'd love to see a similar space 4x game.","May 6","true","282.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Finally something new!\n+ Very responsive and proactive developers (...they just released a free DLC!)\n+ Love the part where you are exploring the map finding different resources (it is like in Civilization)\n+ Crafting system. Quite deep, lot of options.\n+ Interesting combat system. All the combat/challenges are resolved through a card game.\n+ Random events. Huge number of random events occurring = Endless re-playability\n+ Gods. When you start the game you have to choose a God (it is like choosing a faction or race in other strategic games). The more you play the more abilities you unlock for your Gods (they become stronger).\n+ Permadeath (this might not be positive for everyone). If one of your villagers get killed they stay dead.\n\nI cant really think of any negative side in this game. Maybe I would just say, that if you like visuals in a game you might be disappointed because of the Card game element in the game. There are no animations... It is also quite time consuming like turn based games usually are.\n\nOverall rating 9.5/10\n\nBuy it now! ;-)\n","May 3","true","128.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Each god is pretty unique; one god focuses on night and stealth and attacking at night, while another might focus on gathering, so you followers may gather more local materials.\n\nGame is roguelike, so you only get one save, so if you leave your base unprotected you might get attacked and all the villagers could be killed.  When the HP of your follower goes to 0 there is a chance next turn that he or she dies w/o fuel (wood types) or food (many types).\n\nThe crafting system is pretty deep.  Each time you do an event in the world you get exp that improves your followers (a lot of aspects, hp to carrying weight).  You can spend a research point in either crafting, resources, or buildings.  Crafting armor and bows is valuable, and can make difficult fights into normal ones.\n\nThere are day and night cycles so each turn seems more realistic than Civ 5 (where in 5000 BC you turn and you walked 1 mile in 1000 years, lol).  Certain gods have more advantages in day and night, and in most cases your visibility is hurt.\n\nEnemy encounters are very dynamic, you don’t have to straight up fight them, you can use your intellect or social skills, so your whole party doesn’t have to be warriors.\n\nGame has a great soundtrack, and even after playing a while doesn’t seem that repetitive.  Most of the main story seems to be voiced over at least at a B quality or higher (great price for the game).\nCombat is a card game, so no unit manipulation, the largest party I was able to get before getting destroyed by 4-5 skull opponents was about 12.  The more cards you have the better.  Offensive and tactic cards make combat very versatile and unique, and challenging.  Since the game is challenging certain events and encounters really shift your expectations (let the demon do his magic in the town), or pushing cards to the front of the initiative line.\n\nThe stories and events are text based, which is fine.  The game could charge a higher premium of these encounters were voiced over completely.\n\nNow for some of the negatives.  Somewhere around 10 hours of gameplay the encounters begin to feel repetitive.  Card art and some of the game art feels childish.  Feels like the developer hire an amateur artist to do most of the card art.  Battle cards are in black and white and seem sketched, not in full color.  There should be a way to total skip the tutorial altogether.\n\nOften after you get tons of a equipment there is no quick way to ID the strength of an item (a level value) so you can speed the game up, or determine if you need to deconstruct the item or not.  There seems to be a lot of time soaking micromanagement when it comes to items and food.  Some of these things should be automated for the player.\n\nAn example in micromanagement when the expedition returns to town, they have to manage the inventory to make sure valuable fuel does not get burned.  Also itemizing every character is tedious.  I wish there was a button to take current inventory items and simply replace the followers current item in the party if the item level > current item level.\n\nA major critique is the overall town.  Unlike civ it seems like you can only have 1 town.  The world is very huge, so I’m not sure how you meant to explore all of it b/c your party cannot venture that fare w/o food.  And there are no settlers, you can start a new town.  Even as a town crows the borders do not increase to encompass new materials to be gathered.   Seems like this part of the game is unfinished, and eventually it forces the player to be a warrior based party.\n\nCard art should be fully colored and unique.\n\nThere should be more stories, almost as if they never repeat for the player.\n\nDespite the critiques, and if they were addressed it would only ENHANCED an already good game.\nThe game is very unique, addicting, fun, and very well priced (especially during a sale).  The developer seems active over the first few days.  Stories are rich, the card game is challenging, soundtrack is solid, this game is defiantly 9/10, and could improve to a 10/10.","November 21, 2015","true","24.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Some of these things should be automated for the player.\n\nAn example in micromanagement when the expedition returns to town, they have to manage the inventory to make sure valuable fuel does not get burned.  Also itemizing every character is tedious.  I wish there was a button to take current inventory items and simply replace the followers current item in the party if the item level > current item level.\n\nA major critique is the overall town.  Unlike civ it seems like you can only have 1 town.  The world is very huge, so I’m not sure how you meant to explore all of it b/c your party cannot venture that fare w/o food.  And there are no settlers, you can start a new town.  Even as a town crows the borders do not increase to encompass new materials to be gathered.   Seems like this part of the game is unfinished, and eventually it forces the player to be a warrior based party.\n\nCard art should be fully colored and unique.\n\nThere should be more stories, almost as if they never repeat for the player.\n\nDespite the critiques, and if they were addressed it would only ENHANCED an already good game.\nThe game is very unique, addicting, fun, and very well priced (especially during a sale).  The developer seems active over the first few days.  Stories are rich, the card game is challenging, soundtrack is solid, this game is defiantly 9/10, and could improve to a 10/10.","November 21, 2015","true","24.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Few things that I particularly dislike :\n1. Repetitive Event. There's good amount of event in this game, but after playing for a while you will keep encounter the same event. Not to mention the main quest. Maybe add some more event?\n2. Bad Tech/Science Design. Aside for crafting tech, the gathering tech and building tech are sorta useless as you mainly gather item from event/battle while advanced building offer little improvement over the basic building. The crafting tech also have its own flaws. In all my games I need only unlock one type of weapon. Well, why unlock another weapon if you already can create strongest weapon of that type. Better spend it on shield and armor. Maybe better Tech/Science design will do. Like combo between gathering and crafting tech, so you can only build Mithril Sword if you unlock Mithril from gathering and Sword from crafting?\n3. Blind Chance. I'm not an expert at rogue-like games but to rely a matter of life and death to pure luck? Really? If there's no chance to save someone then I'll just let it go, but because there's always a CHANCE for that someone to survive, it will always make me feels bad to let them die. And that's definitely not a good experience I want. (Most of time I just load from save, yet sometime I just start a new village out of regret.) Maybe give them last chance to save their life that not based on pure luck? Doctor and herb lessen the chance to die, but still it's only a "CHANCE". Maybe if you give rank to the injury like "Serious, Beyond Help, something" then specify how much doctor skill / herb required to heal them everything will be fine, right?\n4. The Gods. While chose certain God give different benefit, it will be nice to see the Chosen God have greater effect to the story/event. Currently God have a little impact to the events aside from the God related event.\n\nWhile I mainly complaint, I really like the game and just want to see it improved.\nWell, I let the reader discover the good thing. Don't worry, there's many of it. It just better if you find it yourself.\n\nOverall, the game is much fun. I give score 8/10 as there's room to make improvement.","February 18","true","200.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It is text-based so if you don't like to read it might not be for you, but if you do enjoy reading even a tiny bit this game makes you want to read. Rather than the same old 'go there, kill that, bring me this' quests you get lovely little stories and a lot of different options.\n\nWrestle the boars, just hide from the black smokestorm, invite the starving would-be robbers to join you for a meal instead, follow the suspicious cat and just end up watching it play with a ball of string, or just watch the nightmare catching demon do his thing and have a good night's sleep. The atmosphere is lovely (well, gloomy but very well done) and the art just suits it nicely.\n\nMechanically there are a few issues, like the time it takes to properly equip your people, but the devs are very active in the forums and still working on improving the game. Gotta give em props for that.\n\nLong story short, if you like stories and atmosphere rather than bright colourful 3d animations and cutscenes this game might just be the one for you.","February 3","true","218.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Sometimes, you die by the RNG but don't know it for 20 turns, because you lost a powerful unit and newbie humans can't fight dragons.\n\n*OR* you can use The One True Strategy and fight the same card game battle the same way 500 times, because the auto-resolve will eventually kill that really powerful unit and then you'll lose 20 turns later.\n\nYou'd think that with half a dozen different ways to win a battle you'd need to build a generalist party. Nope. Because that nerfs your ability to use the win method (combat) that can always be used, and then you lose that powerful unit, and then you lose 20 turns later. Because if you have a balanced party half the time your front line fighters will be half gatherers who can't carry heavy armor.

All characters have different stats and weapons that can be a matter of life or death depending on the resources you gather.\n\nAnd to make your life a bit easier in Thea, you must choose a deity before the game start which can give ye a boost yer settlement and its inhabitants (Lada and Mokosh are both great for those wanting a good start).\n\nQuestion 3: Neat! Anything not so great in this game?\n\nHmm for me the main quests is a bit short and the difficulty can really affect this one especially if you choose the map size into small. A high level group of 10-15 well equipped villagers can finish this singlehandedly.\n\nAnother comment for me, is the spamming of enemies is bit fast would make many new players camp (ha!) at the village and restricts them from exploring the world (this could be edited again at the difficulty option).\n\nQuestion 4: Any additions you want to see in the future for this game?\n\nIf this game would have an expansion or dlc, I would like to see an expansion of the main/divine quest especially finishing these quests such as the rebuilding of the world, an AI/PVP between villages/rival deities and finally the terrain affecting the card battle.\n\nConclusion: Thea: The Awakening is a fresh take towards the 4x and Survival genres and those who love a good post apocalyptic setting with a unique battle system should try this.\n\nRating: Lada/10","November 21, 2015","true","91.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

You venture out from your village to gather resources, explore, and figure out what to do about this whole "fall of various gods" thing.\n\nIt is interesting and quite a bit of fun, and different than anything I've played, but it can be very RNG heavy and there are some flaws as well.  One of the central themes is that you split up your survivors and leave some at the village while others go out to explore.  I have had more than once when a powerful enemy waunders in and pretty much kills off your village.  There isn't much you can do about it other than never really split up and explore, which makes the entire game sitting at your village.  Because of this, you pretty much have to figure there is a chance you'll lose the game for no good reason every time you go out to explore.  I can think of a half dozen examples of game design failure like this, but it hasn't stopped me from enjoying the game.\n\nIt isn't perfect by any strech of the imagination, but just the originality of the game makes it worthwhile for a few playthroughs of fun.","March 23","true","47.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It isn't that intense or complex, but it manages to be interesting, addictive, and challenging. It could be described as a brutal casual game; easy to lose, but also easy to pick up. More difficult in tactics than in strategy, and combat is unforgiving (though often avoidable).\n\nMuch of the novelty and challenge comes from the card-based combat and skill-check system. Each kind of skill check involves the same card game, but different skills contribute to the HP, Armour, Damage, and abilities of the character cards in different kinds of checks. You have to have a tactical mind or you will end up with half your team dead.\n\nThe illustrations and writing are good, but the voice acting gets a bit grating, and the in game graphics aren't great. It isn't just that the graphics look a bit dated, but also that the colour palette is so drearily brown-grey and lacking in contrast. However, this does make the event/npc illustrations really stand out as eery and magical. Strangely, despite the  quality of the event images, many of the character portraits are badly drawn.

Nice thing about this game is that it is NOT like all the other RPG dungeon type games out there.

It has elements of both with added elements all its own.\n\nThe card battle system is fun and flexible - each villager  is represented by a card that has multiple actions available depending on that villager's skills, weapons, and stats.\n\nThe scope of the game is much more intimate than either Civ or Heroes.   Every villager has a name and stats and equipment - from your gatherers and crafters to your warriors. Gatherers and Crafters can equip armor and weapons, and warriors can equip tools.\n\nYou get a single village and a limited number of villagers, but rather than making the game seem smaller, this makes the game more interesting and the stakes higher as any lost villager is a blow to the community.\n\n\nThe interface could use a little polishing but nothing game breaking and the game is still in early access.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a game that is fun and engaging without being overwhelming, Thea is a good choice.  Well worth the money.","October 31, 2015","true","92.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

I'm not done with the game, but I've never eXpanded. The combat is interesting and rather fun but there is still too many things in combat that are indeterminate and as such are decided with a simple coin toss. This will sometimes be in your favor, and sometimes cause you a loss and wipe. Some very unintuitive thigns about the battle system.. if you try to sneak with a small party it is impossible, if you try to sneak with a huge party (20+) it is a cakewalk. The game has wired into the combat system that more villagers will make every aspect of the game easier (all aspects). So load everyone up in the minivan and drive on through Thea.\n\nThe UI could use some serious improvements in regards to equipment and resource management. It would be nice to see party wide stat aggregates. Expedition parties can become very large and knowing what your squad is capable of might take you 10 minutes of reading each of the villagers bio's. If the party aggregate stats could be listed up front, at least you would know what skills exist within the party. In regards to equipment, you will have to hover back and forth constantly to determine which gear will suit each villager best. There's no comparator.\n\nHowever, this games (with it's flaws) is still fun. I do not know how to beat this game. On normal I always become surrounded by enemies that can one shot each one of my citizens. There will be 10 dragon nests within 8 tiles of my town and there's nothing I can do to clear it. On normal.. this seems odd, perhaps this game wasn't difficulty adjusted?","January 18","true","29.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Research speed, enemy progress speed, disabling saving, etc ... Changing these also impacts the rate of experience gain for unlocking and leveling your gods.\n\nThea: The Awakening gameplay consists mostly of crafting/research, exploration/combat, and quests (some random, some more story-based). You begin by selecting from several gods (some of which need to be unlocked by playing), which determines some bonuses for your villagers (such as research bonuses, combat bonuses, etc). Each of your villagers has their own typical RPG elements like levels, stats, equipment, etc...\n\nAlthough there is a main quest line (which is basically the same) and diety quest lines, the game doesn't necessarily stop once those have been completed. You can choose continue on, or even stop before completing the quests lines. Gameplay is pretty simple and you can micromanage combat, or auto-resolve to speed things along.\n\nThe UI is simple enough to use, though could use some improvement in areas to make accessing some screens / information easier - but it is no reason to avoid this game.\n\nResearch is plentiful, and straight forward. There are lots of recipe combinations for crafting that consists of basically a primary and secondary material - keeps things interesting enough -- though I would enjoy more complexity or variance.\n\nOverall I have not been able to play much of anything else, as I keep coming back to this one.","February 12","true","898.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For the unfamiliar, 4X games stand for Explore, Expand, Exploit, and Exterminate, similar to the famous Civilization series.\n\nGameplay revolves around developing a single outpost by exploring the surrounding areas, collecting resources, and crafting items and equipment based upon what is available to you. The 3 primary character classes: Harvester, Warrior, and Craftsman make up the trinity of the explore, harvest, build cycle that fuels the expansion of your infrastructure and power.\n\nCombat is card based (each character is a card), and the uses of each card depend on the characters abilities. There are many ways to engage an enemy in combat; if your exploring group is weak but has strong gathering abilities you can engage in a hunting challenge instead. These alternative fighting methods are preferable because characters can only die or suffer wounds in direct combat. Death is VERY punishing, on higher difficulties with "Realism" (no duplicate buildings) it is difficult to acquire more characters, losing harvesters or craftsman can be a huge setback.\n\nAnd you will have setbacks. Thea introduces a system of random events that make each game a fresh experience. The random events are typically problems or encounters, where the player must select choices based upon the abilities of their characters. An example: a group of robbers confronts you, you can try to manipulate them through a social debate, fight them head on, or bribe them off with food and equipment. Choosing incorrectly in a higher stakes event can mean the end of your run.\n\nThis brings me to one of my favorite aspects of Thea: the level of challenge and adjustable difficulty. Nearly every aspect of game difficulty can be modified when a new game is created, anything from number of starting villagers, the difficulty of challenges, or the rate at which enemies grow stronger can be scaled from novice to expert level. Thea is a hard game in that it's easy to make mistakes that get your people killed and cripple your production, but the benefit is that you will see your progress as you improve your ability to avoid risks and adapt to what game situations you are given.\n\nThea: The Awakening is an enjoyable indie game and a bargain even at full price. The developers are still very active in updating the game and responding on the forums, I look forward to what else Muha will bring us.\n","February 6","true","168.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I liked the combination of resources to craft different things, but as it progressed to about the middle of the game, where I could make two expediture groups for questing and hunting, I began to ask myself: why can't I create another city, build walls for my territory, put my men on those walls and fend the monsters off? Why can't I do some work with the magical attack and defend? Can I set auto to the groups to assign different tasks?\n\nI think the suvival concept is only the beginning of the game, since the game allow us to become stronger, through research and crafting.

There is a slight learning curve with combat; however, after a little bit of time, you will feel right at home with selecting which members of the village to bring with you to adventure. Most of the quests or events in the game at the beginning of the game will have you fight "monsters", or creatures to harvest their resources; however, as the game progresses, you'll need to use other means available to you in order to solve certain quests IE you may have avoided a battle if you had an experienced hunter with you that could have set traps before engaging in battle with enemies to weaken them. Another situation that comes up is solving conflicts, and disagreements and you will fail the 'skill check' if members of your party aren't intelligent enough or savvy enough.\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nThe game is quiet deep with wonderful lore and story around every corner.\n\nNot all demons are bad, nor are some of the other humanoid races IE orcs, elves, and dwarves; however, that doesn't mean that they're all good either. There will be a lot of trial and error when you play this game. Sometimes you'll want to  take a chance, other times it may pay off to play it safe to avoid conflicts; however, don't take too long because as the number of turns you take increases, the world around you becomes more inhospitable with more enemies spawning with greater and greater strength.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, the crafting system is very deep.

Where to start. I haven't played the first part of the campaign through, so bear with me.\n(wall of text/)\n\nYou are a god! Cast out from the heavens or suchlike by the Darkness (evil stuff!). Fortunately you have believers and you set about finding your way back. (grossly shortened - I really like the story)\n\nCharacters: Each character (toon) can do two thing I guess: Fight and craft or gather. All toons can fight, but if it's a gathering toon he/she is strong in that respect. I started with 10 toons; 6 in a exploring party (think kinda D&D/roleplaying here) and 4 in the village - crafting and gathering. Each toon is very very different with different skills and abilities. You can merge the exploring party with the village and pick and choose which to go where. Food and wood and most critical to survive, and if your exploring party runs out of food you will starve and die.\nWhen the party is exploring you will find some areas that has a icon above it. Event time! A screen comes up with your possible choices on it. You select one > Search ruin, and sometimes the ruin is abandoned and sometimes it's not. And this is leading to...\n\nFighting: This is where I was most sceptical because it's card driven, but I must admit I was wrong. I dislike card driven games but I really like it. Your fighters are the cards, some fight and some stay back supporting. The supporting toons use their skills to help a toon fighting. There's more to it than this. Oh, and keep some armour and weapons and the village. There's other partys running around with ill intent!\n\nCrafting: This is where the game really shines. It's so simple and yet so complex. You can use nearly everything you gather or find. To make a hammer I used a iron bar, some wood and some other stuff (I can't remember). But if I used some other material, like steel, the time it took to make would be longer but the weight and the Research (see tech) would be greater. You can cook meals, develop tools, weapons, clothes and construct buildings. And when you click on a item, for instance a weapon, you can see what it's made out of! YAY!\n\nTech: You have a tech-tree and I noticed that when you search ruins and develop new tools you develop Research to do new things. There's Gathering, Crafting and Construction Research. I just researched and few Gathering things and when it's done I get 5 pieces at my village and a known location where I can get the stuff.\n\nVillage: It's fairly like Civilization and not like Civilization.

I admit I was a bit put off at first by the "Civ" look thinking it could not pull me into its world, but the artwork (cards, quests, etc) is simply amazing.\n\nLevel up your peasants and city in order not to be run over by monsters.\n\nPros:\n- ♥♥♥♥ing awesome artwork. I love it.\n- Addictive game, just like Civ or Heroes ("just one more turn").\n- Really good quests. Fantastic writing, with lots and lots of small details that will make you believe you entered a world engulfed in darkness. (References to Lil' Red Riding Hood, Man in the Mask ....)\n- Great game mechanics, especially that you do not have to solve everything fighting. The way it works you might just kill a big enemy stack with your medics poisoning their food, or talking it over and have them handover their weapons and food. The HEX challenges are a great way to bring some variety (and realism) into the world.\n- High replayability value.\n\nCons:\n\n- No world map! >:( This has to be the major/only real issue I encountered so far. Especially on bigger maps it is really frustrating that you cannot zoom out more/ enter a map. There are quite a few examples in the 4x genre that delivered a great, atmospheric map and I am sure this game could do the same. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring us a map!!\n- Auto-resolve can be tricky at times, being less than optimal.\n- World creation a bit slow (not really a big issue tbh).\n- I would love to see having the items you equip have some effect on the card artwork, but that is a minor detail.\n\nPlease developers.... give us a map!!!!!!!","January 31","true","44.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The premise of the game is that darkness fell over the world, the gods went afk and only now a hundred years later is light returning. Along with light, the gods return (the player character being one of them) and you take control over a single village plus a small band of survivors. Your goal is to discover what happened to the world and restore your full power as a god.  In reality though, the goal is to gather enough food to survive and enough warriors to not be eaten by monsters.\n\nThe gameplay looks like Civilization at first as it's turn-based and the map is a hex grid, but the comparisons soon end. You lead your band of warriors around the map, searching for resources and treasure. Along the way you encounter quests, potential allies and enemies. Success or failure then depends on a card game, with the cards either based on your skills (hunting, social, poison etc) or your warriors prowess. The card game would take a while to explain so I recommend watching some gameplay, but it's fairly intuitive. It's good fun, rewards strategy and heavily punishes mistakes.\n\nYou also have a village to care of. Your villagers gather local resources, construct buildings and defend themselves from attack. Earning experience in the game grants you research points which can be used to unlock the means to construct new buildings, craft armour and weapons, as well as ever important recipes for food.  You'll require your warriors to bring back the rare materials needed to craft the good stuff of course.\n\nThe game is held together with a uniquely Slavic soundtrack and a choose your own adventure style story, entirely text based. Presented each game slightly differently thanks to an impressive amount of random events. I really like the game, even if part of me wishes it could evolve further towards Civilization in an expansion.","February 2","true","15.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

To make it easier for me and you to see if this is a game you would like, go to Lets Play Thea: The Awakening by "tokshen" on YouTube, he has some great videos on how to play it and does a great job explaining the game.\n\nAfter watching several videos I got the gist of the game and bought it, and have been playing it ever since.  Nice thing about this game is that it is NOT like all the other RPG dungeon type games out there.  Yes, there is crafting and such and killing mobs, but the real trick is combat which is done with playing cards of the men and women in your Exploration Team and you use these cards to outwit and kill your opponents.\n\nThe card fighting takes a bit in getting use to, but I love this because I do not have to button mash to kill anything, which really does get tired after awhile in almost any game.  This takes some stratedy.  It has a UI built in tutorial but it is not that thourough,  Tommorrow I am going to check for a game guide to be sure I am not missing anything important.\n\nThis game came out of BETA not that long ago, so they apparantely revised a lot before this final version.

Where to start. I haven't played the first part of the campaign through, so bear with me.\n(wall of text/)\n\nYou are a god! Cast out from the heavens or suchlike by the Darkness (evil stuff!). Fortunately you have believers and you set about finding your way back. (grossly shortened - I really like the story)\n\nCharacters: Each character (toon) can do two thing I guess: Fight and craft or gather. All toons can fight, but if it's a gathering toon he/she is strong in that respect. I started with 10 toons; 6 in a exploring party (think kinda D&D/roleplaying here) and 4 in the village - crafting and gathering. Each toon is very very different with different skills and abilities. You can merge the exploring party with the village and pick and choose which to go where. Food and wood and most critical to survive, and if your exploring party runs out of food you will starve and die.\nWhen the party is exploring you will find some areas that has a icon above it. Event time! A screen comes up with your possible choices on it. You select one > Search ruin, and sometimes the ruin is abandoned and sometimes it's not. And this is leading to...\n\nFighting: This is where I was most sceptical because it's card driven, but I must admit I was wrong. I dislike card driven games but I really like it. Your fighters are the cards, some fight and some stay back supporting. The supporting toons use their skills to help a toon fighting. There's more to it than this. Oh, and keep some armour and weapons and the village. There's other partys running around with ill intent!\n\nCrafting: This is where the game really shines. It's so simple and yet so complex. You can use nearly everything you gather or find. To make a hammer I used a iron bar, some wood and some other stuff (I can't remember). But if I used some other material, like steel, the time it took to make would be longer but the weight and the Research (see tech) would be greater. You can cook meals, develop tools, weapons, clothes and construct buildings. And when you click on a item, for instance a weapon, you can see what it's made out of! YAY!\n\nTech: You have a tech-tree and I noticed that when you search ruins and develop new tools you develop Research to do new things. There's Gathering, Crafting and Construction Research. I just researched and few Gathering things and when it's done I get 5 pieces at my village and a known location where I can get the stuff.\n\nVillage: It's fairly like Civilization and not like Civilization. There's children that grow up and you get another toon. But here is the smart thing: You decide if you need another fighter, gatherer or crafter. Sweet! You can do so much more. But the wall of text is growing too long.\n(/wall of text)\n\nIn short: It's something like Civ/D&D/Warlords all put together. This game is so deep!

Highly customizable difficulty settings and auto-resolvable battles allow you to choose a  level of challange that suits your personal preferences. The well-presented user interface also has helpful topics that drop down when you hover over any stat or icon.\n\nCombat is fun, refreshing and simpler than you may think. Your characters (represented by cards) are randomly placed into the offensive or defensive positions on the board, you choose positions for your offensive cards on the battle area, use your defensive cards for buffs/debuffs and then each side will auto-battle by attacking opponents at either side of them.\n\nBecoming familiar with the large number of icons and how to gather food and resources is a learning curve, but once surpassed reveals a highly rewarding combination of exploration, crafting and encounters with many curious characters, mysterious monsters and bizarre beings.\n\nThe main story arc is nicely voice-acted but in my opionin it's outdone by the excellent storytelling found in the numerous sidequests. Every encounter is accompanied by beautiful, painterly artwork (there really ought to be an artbook of some form available). The high-quality soundtrack is very easy on the ears, a nice fit for the fantasy theme.\n\nFor anyone on the fence about this due to the strategic/management/4x elements: just go fot it.

Dev support is phenomenal. Every time I come back to this game, there's more to it, and the balance is better, and there's new UI features that add quality-of-life.\n\nThis game's got a nebulous genre identity, but at the core, I'd say the gameplay is a 4x resource management experience comparable to Endless Legend, This game has the explore, exploit, exterminate, no expanding, but for the lack of that, there's RPG pieces, roguelike pieces...\n\nGameplay is really deep, and by that I don't just mean "complicated." Yes its complicated to understand it at all and make it all work in your favor, but even more than that, the ability to fine tune difficulty to one's liking really lets a player poke and prod the various systems of the game to their heart's content. A lot of times "roguelike" or "roguelike elements" generally means that a game is going to be too hard and offer no apology, but the challenge in Thea can be dropped to nothing or ramped to impossible.\n\nEven after the event sequences are memorized (and btw they've added more) the game remains interesting, simply because an instance of Thea has so many dynamic elements moving at once. The world maps feel alive.\n\nGiven the number of elements going on, there's a learning curve. Some players may feel adverse to things like the card battles, I did at first, and some may judge it for how they feel about the card battles after a few hours and throw it away. For me though, I feel like they'd be missing a great deal of what the game has.\n\nBeing the original indie material that this game is, it's really a diamond in the rough.","May 13","true","175.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is a tech tree of sorts but no information of benefits or what kind of material is required which means you may be screwed again and cannot make the new fancy tech. The raw materia needed may be far away with the above mentioned random killing encounters.\nWait for patches folks.","November 27, 2015","false","44.4"," 25 of 51 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","25","51","2","3"

I bought this game based on the great reviews and while the game has many finely tuned options compared to most others, its really not all that. If i had to sum it up, id say i beat the game in 2 days witrh little problem. For a older gamer like myself thats a issue.\n\nThe crafting and skill point allocation system is nice.\nLots of different weapons, armor, and shield.\n3 different classes - Dps, witch, and med.\nA unique battle system. Unique in that you can eventually defeat your foes in different way - Fight, social, intelligence ect,\n\nThe game lacks longevity. While there are i think it was 7 different gods to play with, its the same play/story for each one.\nWhile i do appreciate the deeply written story, the options provided really have no major significance. You will be given 2-4 differnt ways to answer a situation, but all lead towards the same path.\n\nIt is however a $20 game. Its not that its bad, its just not great. If you are completely bored and looking for a good story with some quick side fun, then Thea will do you right.\n\nSigh.. Where are all the new age RPG's with old Wizardry feel?

It's like a mashup up Legendary Heroes and a survival game.\n- Gearing up warriors and villagers as I gather more resources.\n- The game is challenging and unforgiving, but without feeling demotivating.\n- There are several ways to deal with encounters, like fighting, talking, sneaking, etc.\n- You can rename your characters, which makes it much easier to see where your gear is in use.\n- The more you play a certain god, the more bonuses you get when you start new games with that god.\n- Tutorial can be skipped if you want.\n- Polished graphics\n\nThings I don't like:\n- It's not very clear what you should do, except survive. I've won the game twice, but... I dont even know how/why I won it!...... I keep playing it because I'm tryng to understand it o.O\n- Replayability is not that good. After a couple of games you start thinking "If I start a new game, everything will be like last game, so why would I?"\n- There's no summary of village bonuses from buildings.\n- When you send your expedition\units somewhere that takes several turns to go, you have to move them manually every turn. And there's no reminding you that they haven't moved. Why?\n- It's a bit hard and time-consuming to keep track of what equipment is excessive and what to keep. A lock-function or something would be nice.\n- The longer into the game I get, the more I keep ending turn because I'm waiting for rare resources to be gathered. Not the most exciting end game.\n- The quest log feels like a mess, it's tiresome to figure out what exactly is left to do.\n- I have close to 200 kids, and I still have to wait several turns before 1 of them grows up...

I genuinely like some things about this game, but there are too many rookie designer mistakes for me to recommend it. The encounter system is unbalanced. While the combat card mini-game is a novel idea that I warmed to initially, it somehow doesn't fully satisfy and is definitely repetitive after only a few bouts, lacking any deeper strategy or actual tough decisions. Also, I'm not sure how balanced the combat system is when an auto-resolved battle against some enemies resulted in zero wounds the first time, where another auto-resolved battle with the exact same enemy grouping resulted in one death and numerous wounded characters... Numerous small disappointments turns a promising purchase into a frustrating one.\n\nCity management is clunky and could be more intuitive. Character skills are poorly displayed and unclear in their application. Other systems within the game also feel incomplete. This game ends up being hard not because it's hard, but because the overall execution is either half-♥♥♥♥♥ or half-guessed (and thus only half-good). This game was so close to being really good, only to fall short - if maybe only slightly short, and in numerous ways.\n\nAnother gripe that doesn't necessarily impact gameplay, but is super annoying, is the dialogue scripting and choices. Almost every response you can choose from is written sarcasticly from an immature point of view. Example, when encountering a Goddess walking along in the forest, I had no options that demonstrated the humility due in such a situation, only banal 12-year old remarks such as "Oh yea? So you're a goddess - so what of it?!" or some such dribble.","November 25, 2015","false","6.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ellye/recommended/378720/","Ellye","Ellye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ellye/","373 products in account","I really like what this game is trying to accomplish, but it undermines itself at every turn.\n\nThe combat minigame is interesting and well designed - but enemy parties are extremely repetitive; and numbers end up mattering way more than any sort of tactic.\n\nThe gathering and crafting system seems interesting and there was a lot of potential.... but it undermines itself completely. There are a ton of itens you can craft, but the vast majority of them are completely useless because you can also craft stuff that's straight flat-out better, but you don't even need to craft those too - you'll get so much loot that you won't need to bother. And the tooltips will tell that some resources are "rare", but that's just fluff. Every resource is exactly as common - as soon as you "research" it, a deposit is 100% guaranteed to appear somewhere you explored, and deposits are infinite. So there's no point bothering with early game resources, side-grade resources, or such, since the supposedly rare resources are just as easy to come by and just as infinite. The crafting research tree is also a problem. The fact that by default you can't craft any weapon means that your crafting abilities will pretty much always lag behind what you can find by simply exploring and looting - making craft almost moot except for food and such. There are very few buildings, and a few of them are pretty much useless too, reducing the number even further.\n\nTo some degree, the concepts in this game remind me of two separate games: King of Dragon Pass and Civilization IV: Colonization. Both of those games employ their share of those concepts in much better ways.\n\nWhile playing Thea, I barely feel like I'm actually "playing" anything. It feels like I'm just watching the random game unfold, because almost everything I do is just tedious busywork. The "decisions" I'm required to make are so bland and so obvious that they also end up feeling tedious and moot.","November 25, 2015","false","9.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

Unfortunately for those of you who are like me and can't stand unwinnable situations or any form of RNG then you won't find much enjoyment in this.\n\nTo be a bit more specific, this game is a resource management, exploration, economy progression system, that has a card game mechanic that influences all combat (And several non-combat) situations.\n\nYour cards have an offensive stat value that determines the damage they will deal, when you play a card and end your turn your opponent gets a turn to play a card to the right of that card, barring certain skills. The leftmost card acts first in the combat phase and when each card attacks, they can only attack the nearest card to the left OR the right. Now at first this all seems fine and fairly easy to manipulate and keep enemies attacking who you want, but it doesn't just target the nearest, it chooses a random direction, THEN targets the nearest in that direction. In other words, you may have a formation set up for best efficiency and safety if your cards all attack in the proper directions, but they choose not to and instead use their 27 damage attack to kill the 1 health 3 damage spider instead of the 26 hp 32 damage spider queen, allowing the said queen to attack next turn, killing a card of yours which wounds your character.\n\nWhich brings me to the next subject, wounds. Wounds are fine, for the most part, until it becomes completely impossible to save a wounded character. They get a little hurt, get gravely wounded, you set up camp to keep them alive, a turn passes, they die. For seemingly no reason, my characters will die from wounds that should be healing whilst in camp and whilst having a medic. As far as I can tell there's no way to manually heal a wounded character. On a similar note, it's very much possible to run into enemies that are far beyond your power level who will just absolutely wipe the floor with you, and even if they don't SOMEONE will get wounded. Characters have to either be strong enough to win, or they will simply lose. Skill doesn't seem to have much to do with the combat and that disappoints me.\n\nThe next real negative thing would be the grind. Haven't played enough of it yet but there are several gods which each require a different god be levelled up to 3 to unlock, and you don't even get to choose who is unlocked.\n\nTL;DR The game has the potential to be great, but with very little control over certain situations it's hard to like it. Cards randomly choosing which way to attack and completely ruining your plans, or randomly running into an enemy you have no chance against is just demoralizing.\n\nPending further investigation and a little more game time, this review/recommendation is subject to change. As it stands, with the knowledge I do have of it, I would not recommend it as I feel out of control.","December 13, 2015","false","15.6"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Anybody playing at 300% is going to have to sweat every single move.\n\nBut the developers listened to their hardcore players too much. The April update totally upended the difficulty curve. New player who hasn't figured out how to win by turn 200? Die. Skilled player playing casually who hasn't won by turn 200? Die. Player playing at the limits of your skill who can't win by turn 200? Die.\n\nThe hardcore player's fun is not every player's fun, and game developers who think so are deluded.\n","April 20","false","34.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Also, other reviews titled this game as "deep", "challenging" and "rich of content".\n\nUnfortunately, I must disagree. There is nothing deep about this game. You collect resources and do some multiple-choice quests, that is it. The game itself is not challenging, the random number generator (RNG) is the challenge. Or, at the same time, it eliminates the challenge because it blesses you with strong artifacts.\n\nAs for the content. Yes, there are a lot of characters, items and quests in the game. But they are all way too similar. Even worse, regardless whether you do combat, use speech to convince your foes or try other means such as "tactics", "hunt" and "stealth", it always results in the same card mini game.\n\nWhich would necessarily be bad, but since the card game is 80% luck and 20% skill/planning, it is the same RNG that creates or takes the challenge.\n\nFinally, the game, while not exactly great looking, is poorly optimized. Which means that I cannot play it on my laptop (5200U, 8GB RAM, GeForce 940M) which runs Endless Legend just fine (which looks better and is also based on the Unity Game Engine). Even at only 720p, it get only about 10 fps. It runs ok on my desktop system (i5 4670K, 16GB RAM, GeForce 660 Ti), though.","November 22, 2015","false","8.7"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","12","28","0","1"

LITTLE. CONTENT.\nI had great fun for the first 10 hours, enjoyed the next 5 hours, but after that I only wanted to win a game and see if there's more to it, but again sadly there isn't.\n\nCity:\nYou can build buildings (about 10 different ones) which all either boost a stat of people IN YOUR CITY (so it doesn't benefit your warriors roaming around the map) and/or give a chance for a new citizen to join you.\nYou can craft objects; different weapons, armours and crafting/gathering tools, also different kinds of food.\nYou can assign people to gather nearby resources ONLY in the 6 Hexes directly around your city, which may or may not have anything at all on them (random)\nand... that's mostly it. There are sometimes random events like storms, demons which might be nice or naughty, or rites and festivals, in these you mostly have different options to choose from, which will give different results, but there are waaay to few of these to be interesting longer than a few hours.\n\nExpedition:\nMost of your gameplay will be your Expeditions. You form them in your City, you can send however many and whomever you want out. You need to give them food (else they take damage each turn) and fuel (else they cannot heal when they make camp), and preferably weapons and armor, as they will fight all the time. Out on the Map you encounter enemies which you can kill (or defeat through other means, like diplomacy or tactics) and different random events like a lone elven wanderer that may join you after you help them out, or a frosty queen and her escort which will send you on a quest.\nYou can make camp with your expedition, which allows your people to gather ressources from the 6 surrounding Hexes and heals them faster.\nThere IS a main-story, and quite some backstory if you are willing to read a lot of text, however I didn't find it intriguing enough to keep reading after the first 10 hours.\n\nBonus Hate:\nEvents sometimes let you trade items with travelers, but what you give them is ALWAYS RANDOM. So you might give your best weapon away for something useless, or you may offer someone fuel, and instead of giving them normal firewood you give them extremely rare ancient wood instead.\n\ntl;dr:\nTOO LITTLE CONTENT\nif you're fine with 20 hours of fun, I DO recommend this!\nIf you want more, get something else.\n\nAlso I have to say that the combat is VERY well made, once you get behind it. It is less random than many people say, the trick is that you have to get the initiative and plan from there ;)","January 2","false","23.0"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

The artists on this game should be commended, they've done a great job on the artwork.\n\nUnfortunately the gameplay here, and in particular the card battles become very stale, very quickly.  Whilst you are able to build up your group with decent equipment and skills to fight well, the system forces you to fight every minor battle as the auto-resolve option will always lead to members of your expeditions taking unnecessary wounds, which in turn will cause them to die.\n\nAt certain points in the game your opponents will suddenly spike in power.  The drive behind this system seems to assure that the players loses any of its developed group members.  This is not the steady curve of a fun challenge but a punishment and an excercise in player frustration.\n\nConstruction of a civ's buildings doesn't seem to do much.  I'm unaware if there is an unreported bug with this system but after constructing the buildings that were to help gain new people I didn't receive any new population for the entirety of my gaming session.\n\nI certainly had high hopes for this game.

At first glance it reminded me of Civilization V as the map goes but you only have the one town.  Potential resources all around (that become visible when they are individually unlocked) but you find out really quick that while lesser resources can help earn research xp you mostly just focus on finding dragon bone and leather, mithril, ancient wood, moonstone and diamond (maybe some gold to build walls to attract dwarves) because those resources build the best items and all other ones are outclassed.  Oh and for structures; almost all of them are essentially useless.  The well feels like it should be nessasary but its uses are mundane, the herbalists hut and cabbage field are moot, the smith and totem might be useful... but by this time I tend to have enough villagers that can use magic that I don't need the totem and you'll only really need half a dozen good smiths to put out a steady churn of items.  The real structure to build is the pallisade because its the best at attracting townspeople.  This feels like a cool option but so many other races are useless, animals and demons (yes demons) are so weak (that's right, weak demons) that they are more of a hindrance, it's really all about attracting orcs or dwarves and by this I mean they are overpowered.  I could go on about other issues but I just realized I'd be here for an hour so I'll try and cut it short, there are just a lot of balancing issues.  Balancing issues and the game story is so short and predictable that replaying it to earn another god began to feel more tedious.  Now understand, this isn't a bad game.  This is still in Early access and I do think it has potential.  But a slight lack of content (could use a longer story line, more monsters and different encounters) and balance in game to make other resources or buildings more relevant makes the replay of this difficult for the 4 of us that have played this.  Keep your eye on this though, it's not quite done baking yet.","October 25, 2015","false","93.9"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","0"

It took a number of restarts to work out how the hell I survive without losing characters consistently, but that just added to the fun of creating the strategy. It is just such a refreshing take in gaming.\n\nI have to give thumbs down as there is a bug in my current save that randomly stops displaying any text whilst talking in the event. Specifically it is one of the cosmic tree quests, the one with the dragon... whenever I try to sneak or social him it just goes blank and I have to alt-ctrl-del. Pretty annoying as it won't let me get past that point. Not sure if my save is corrupted or what. It did this in my previous game as well but on a different story quest, so I can't actually keep going :(\n\nI will definately change my vote to a yes if I can play without breaking my keyboard lol.","November 22, 2015","false","11.1"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","2"

The sad reality is, this game is pretty much Endless Legend without the beautiful art or depth.  The main selling points peopel will use for Thea are the Slavvic folklore and the card battle system.  While I have no particular opinion on the folklore, the card battle system is in my opinion, uninspired, repetitive and boring.  Characters seem to become wounded at random, I had characters who lost all their HP in combat receiving no wounds while characters who were hit only for 1/4 their HP received heavy wounds.\n\nBulding, research, expansion and actual conflict all feel lacking.  It's not a traditional 4X as you do not play against other civilizations, tribes or groups in your own situation, just AI controlled encounters.  It is a very slow game with many turns passing simply gathering the materials you need to build or craft.  I would recommend people try Endless Legend over Thea: The Awakening unless you have a particular penchant for Slavvic folklore.","November 22, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

Aquisition of resources looks to be either based on lucky start position, or on sending out gathering expeditions.  I didn't get to a point where either of those seemed safe, interesting, realistic, or fun.  Research options don't look to advance the game in any meaningful way.\n\nThe card mini-game is incredibly high stakes.  Which is unfortunate; it looks like the meat and bones of the game.  Failing a combat challenge costs the expedition party.  I earned 2-3 villagers over an entire session, and lost 4-6 in a single failed combat round from a single bad expedition encounter.  This wasn't interesting, or challenging.\n\nMy best luck was skipping the encounters with the automation option.  However, the outcome of encounters I'd play through in the card mini-game was completely decoupled from the automation option.  I don't think the AI actually uses the mini-game at all.  Negative outcomes from success (wounds, etc) were much more marginal than my experiences playing the card game manually.  Even then, encounter "difficulty" was hard to judge.  The skull system implies scaling challenges, but I didn't advance far enough to tell if that's absolute (HERE BE DRAGONS) or relative (THIS IS EASY FOR YOUR AMAZING PARTY).\n\nExploration and combat with my first expedition party was fun, when automating encounters.  I didn't feel like I got anything meaningful as a reward though.  More resources I couldn't use back at town yet?  Skimming research options doesn't show much meaningful short-term choices.  It was difficult to judge the awesomeness of long-term choices, or the power spikes from going down a gathering/crafting path 10-20 turns away.\n\nI would not recommend this game.","November 24, 2015","false","3.4"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","10","1","10","0","0"

It is actually quite refreshing.\n\nUnfortunatelly it is not enough to keep anyone playing so now: The Bad:\n\n1) Thea have big problems with identity. It is not RPG (almost no character development - random level ups), not Strategy (no real resource management of any kind), not tactcal either (card game as resolve to ALL problems). Thea takes a bit from that and bit of taht but this mix offers nothing in long run.\n\n2) DULL. After few hours of playing I realize I have nothing really to do. I can't manage resources (childs in that case) so my village drops drastically. Quest are unimpressed and nothing really pull to see what happen next.\n\nBiggest weaknes is:\n\nCARD FIGHTING - developer use this as remedium to all problems, conflicts and fights. Every situatuin can be resolved by card game but with different "enemies" - eg. if Tactic is choosen our heroes plays against towers -facepalm- After few hours (in my case minutes) this become so dull I start to use SKIP button almost all time. When our party is equiped its even better to press SKIP - generally we gets better results -facepalm-\n\nEDIT:\n\nI forgot about terrible voice acting. One man module his voice so he is elf, dwarf, human, demon, girl, old lady etc...\n\nOverall:\n\nGood game if You pay 2.99 euro and play once.

There is one save state, and you aren't allowed to know when it is, either.  So if you hit load, you just magically load the save state from whenever it is - you can't see it before loading.  Just hitting the load button abandons your pogress and loads the save state from whenever the Hell.\n\nStupid.  That's just plain stupid.  It's anti-fun, anti-player, anti-norm stupidity.\n\nThe combat/challenge mechanic is extremely weak.  Basically, if you take a normal CCG and then dumb it down to the point that you have as much chance of winning if you played with your eyes closed, that's this mechanic.  The auto-resolve is hilariously awful.  Want to lose a combat where you are 3 levels higher than the opponents and want to do it fast?  AUTO-RESOLVE!  I genuinely do not think I have ever seen an auto-resolve so bad.  It's a mini-game within the game - will you lose a gatherer that the AI decided should be the main tank?  Will the AI cause a party wipe?  PLACE YOUR BETS!\n\nWhen a dev basically admits that they have no idea how to balance a game and create a logical difficulty progression, then maybe they shouldn't develop games?

I enjoy it for the most part. I'm going to give some pros and cons here and elaborate a bit afterwards. This isn't going to take too long I hope.\n\nPros:\nRelatively speedy gameplay despite being Turn Based.\nNice atmosphere and tone.\nExtremely good voice acting.\nStrong story with a good narrative approach.\nStylish yet simple.\nRelatively complicated gameplay yet not too difficult to learn.\nArtwork.\nFairly comprehensive.\nMostly interesting encounters.\n\nCons:\nStuttering.\nRNG Insanity.\nYou are not given the proper choices you want for this game to be completely enjoyable(!).\nLack of opposing settlements and what seems to be an inability to expand your own settlement(?).\nLack of Multiplayer(?).\nVery small text boxes.\nThe construction limit is too small.\nMultiple Wells don't stack (Sorry, but that sucks).\n\nCurrent Score - 7/10 - Decent.\n\n\nDetails:\n1. The stuttering is caused by clicking on the "show resource" button. It causes the game to begin stuttering like crazy.\n\n2. Many of stat boxes have super small text which is very hard to read.\n\n3. Here's the biggest issue I have with this game - you are not allowed to choose how your characters progress and which enchantments you place onto your items. This is abysmal. It relies massively on RNG, and it is insanely frustrating to deal with.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that you are not just given the option to choose. You aren't allowed to just specify how you want your characters to progress and which enchantments to give your items. The lack of choice here hurts tremendously in this particular game where some stats are almost completely worthless and some stats are extremely important.\n\n4. You are not allowed to choose which cards are placed into which of your hands. This sucks! If I had an even bigger gripe than the one before, it's that you aren't given the option to decide on which cards you play!\n\ntl; dr - I think this game is okay, but it definitely needs improvement. TOO MUCH RNG! NOT ENOUGH CHOICE!\n\nEdit: The Artwork is pretty nice.\n\nEdit+: New changes to the game apparently prevent resetting the location of resources when you research them. As a result, afaik, it's impossible to win the higher difficulties. Without control over the location of the resources, you're pretty much screwed. And again, you can't make simple decisions like which resources you start with, so have fun resetting for perfect resources for over two hours only to have your entire party wiped out by a coin flip battle round one.","November 27, 2015","false","94.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For 1/4 the price of games like Civilization and the new HOMM games, you get a sort-of-hybrid between the two, that so far seem better than them. Yes I said it, better. This comes from a long-time fan of the Civ games, spending thousands of hours on 2 and 4 and hundreds on 5. Unfortunately they have not managed to renew the concept in a way to my liking over the years. While those games where revolutions in their own time, as HOMM 3, Thea seems like the new wine in 2015. However I am only 50 hours in, so I cannot say anything about the long-term playability yet. At least it's been a total blast so far.\n\nThis makes Thea so good:\n- 1 village, perfect! Basebuilding always got tedious and repetitive in the late-game of other games anyway. It increases the feeling of beeing lonely and lost in a hostile world.\n- Great resource system! You can build a ton of different weapons and other gear. Because the game emphasises several different challenges in addition to regular combat, you want to have specialists in a wide range of areas, like hunting, healing, magic etc. Because of this your characters, that will multiply in numbers after a while, will sport a wide range of differnent gear and abilities. Resources are scarce in the beginning and the game always provides newer and better resources that you can reach for, while providing use also for most of the low-tier ones.\n- The combat system is easy to learn, but hard to master. The lever of potential for micro-management is very high, as in the rest of the game. Protip: When you have learned the system, turn up the animation speed (took me a while to realize this).\n- A limited supply of people. This means that you need to take extra care of all of them, to make sure that they survive. You can give them names, etc. By the way, your camp can attract members of non-human species. Right now my civilization consists of 24 humans and a rock troll by the name of Brick.\n- The icing on the cake is that the game seems virtually bugfree, no crashes, everything works as it should, like a clock. I've tried many indie-games where bugs take away from the experience, not with this one!\n\nI'll get back to gaming, this game is recommended to all hobby-kings and nerd-rulers. *insert generic addiction warning here*","November 25, 2015","true","150.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perhaps new additions to piercing/blunt/first action to increase possibilities.\n- Lack of Unique items (not a big minus, but still)\n- Every individual is so valuable but still we should have some interaction with our people.

Thea is not about gorwing your nation or tribe across multiple settlements but rather exploring and questing in order to expand your single settlement. As you play and fail (you will) you will gain XP which will increase the power of your god and unlock access to play as other dormant god's - who have different bonuses which encourage different styles of play.\n\nI was hesitant at first due to the card game style of play, and it felt a little convoluted at first.

Here's to hoping the developers read these reviews, because there is just so much potential here. This is review is basically going to be a wishlist of sorts of how I think this game could be made even better. It's already quite entertaining, so kudos on that front, but I just wish there was more to it.\n\nFirst off, as has been noted by others, the city development tree is criminially limiting. One could easily play the game without ever building a single structure. I can understand why it's not about copying Civ and focusing on starting new settlements all over the map, but seriously, why can't I turn the one struggling hamlet into a thriving metropolis? This would be pretty easy to implement now that the game is a finished product. Have a set of graphic assets that represent the city in a tiered series of growth stages, each one taking up an additional hex on the map, where growing the city correspondingly expands influence for gathering. Have all manner of new buildings available, plus an upgrade option for improving existing structures once you have access to better resources. Churches, stone walls, schools, fish ponds, mage towers... so many possibilities.\n\nMake these higher level structures resource sinks just the same as population is a resource sink. If the required resource is not available, the bonuses are not provided. Churches can provide divine protections by accepting resource offerings of prepared food from the people. Mage towers allow for the crafting of exclusive mage tower only magic gear and further boost the magic stat above the totem, but only if it is supplied with gems and precious metals. An advanced blacksmith that also provide unique craft recipies but needs coal to operate. Monster repellent towers that lower the incidence of negative events and attacks on the village in response to having such attacks increase as a built in game mechanic in response to a player's prosperity (e.g. tier 2 villages are attacked twice as often, tier 3 three times as often, and so on...) Conversely, a player could build a totem of battle that would actually draw more attacks to the village. A lot of possibilites that would only require minimal adjustments to the game.\n\nNext, it wouldn't hurt at all to simply be more liberal with movement points. The primary reason the game is so glacially slow (which is it's greatest sin) is because it takes forever and a day to get from one place to another. Have a higher MP base value, and another unit stat that gets averaged out over the party that further augments MP (something that is also improved with gear, such as the speciality gear suggested above).\n\nLast is the rarity of new units. Especially in the early portion of a game. I spend an inordinate amout of time savescumming in the first 200 rounds out of simple necessity. I know anyone I lose is basically irreplaceable. It's mildly annoying. Cabbage patch kids should be more frequent.\n\nHopefully the developers will take this into consideration, as it seems like this game is just inches away from being truly great. Now it's just really good but... eh....","March 31","true","86.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A upgrade build as they have in the filter skills,  "Upgrade this Characher gearing toward Social encounters or Physical, or Stealth etc.  I still like the game don't get me wrong but just the random leveling of the characters is odd, you can't really mold your own characters, or maybe the Devs didnt want you to do that, and it's just luck if a character develops the way you would like it too, who knows, but would at least like an option in the settings to either upgrade manually or let computer do it as is now.\n\nAnyway i will still play it and the game is extremely fun and keeps you interested!!!\n\nV","May 23","true","81.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
