If it's discounted and/or you're a big fan of slow, linear point&click adventures of the detective mystery variety, and if you come to it with low expectations, it can offer you some entertaining hours.\n\nIt's obviously a low budget game, technically lacking, very linear, quite old-fashioned, with logical puzzles that offer zero challenge but also zero frustration. And I use the world puzzles very liberally here, most of the time you point, you click, the story moves on. It is also very sloooooow. Seriously, everything is slow: the story, the movements of the characters, the time it takes for clicks to register - this is one for people with patience, and if you can't deal with that stay well away, you'll hate it.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is probably the best part of this game. The other big positive for me is the attempt to describe the detective process in a relatively "realistic" way for the police detectives of the era, or at least their fictional counterparts. I found the characters entertaining, however they're both rather antiheroes than heroes, and not always portrayed in a positive light, and I expect not everyone will like that. The visuals are allright and fit the mood, the sound is barely there but not annoying and the voice acting is decent enough for this kind of budget. The story itself isn't good, isn't bad. Imagine a paperback period detective mystery, a bit of a guilty pleasure with no real substance. However, the ending is bafflingly unfulfilling. The game ends very abrubtly right in the thick of things - I actually thought I hit a bug. That alone may have warranted a downvote, but truth be told I had very low expectations of this game, and the hours I spent with it were pleasurable, so my approach was... oh well, I had fun while it lasted.\n\nConclusion: There are tones of better point & clicks out there. But if you like these types of games and get it cheap, this is not a bad way to spend a relaxed summer afternoon. Think cold drink in one hand, mouse in the other, minimal thinking required. ;)","July 16, 2014","true","7.5"," 44 of 45 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","44","45","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/63110/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","As an interesting and somewhat successful adventure game, Alter Ego is the last video game made by Czech developer team, Future Games which we were familiar from the first game in The Black Mirror series. The studio was closed in 2011 due to financial problems after the release of this last game - which was also the probable underlying reason behind the abrupt ending we have here.\n\n19th century, Plymouth. The city is shaken with the untimely death of Sir William, a deformed young noble with a handful of speculations running about his nature in the newspapers. At the time his funeral is being arranged, the swindler and street rat Timothy Moor comes to the city on a cargo carrier as a stowaway, apprehended by sailors. He manages to escape to find his childhood friend Brian for a job, only to find himself in an uncanny intrigue concerning Sir William himself. Following Tim's misfortune, Detective Briscol - who has just started his first day on the job, investigating a disturbance in the cemetery just after the funeral - becomes a part of the same uncanny intrigue as well. As the story progresses, our unlikely heroes will cross paths to try and shed some light into the dreadful business.\n\nSpoilers for the following paragraph! Firstly, the storyline - being interesting enough during the game - closes up with a dark and unsatisfactory ending; leaving many loose ends which results with the unnecessary demise of our heroes. It is wrapped and misconcluded badly, with stupid mistakes on our "brilliant" main heroes' part. The last dialogue between our main heroes is misguiding and uncharacteristic, screaming out "we couldn't end the game as we intended to due to budget problems". The whole experience is as good as it lasts, but by the last 10 minutes of the game, you'll be disappointed if you'll be expecting an interesting conclusion.\n\nOur main characters on the other hand, are intriguing and well written antiheroes rather than benevolent defenders of justice. They are successfully portrayed with their inner monologues displayed for the player, to reveal some truth to their nature aside their demeanor. They have severe character flaws, somewhat foul natures and an incredible amount of vanity; eventually resulting with their own downfall. Very humane and very well-done.\n\nGraphics are made in AGDC, resulting in a successfully grim atmosphere with grayish colors dominating the century. Environment design is probably one of the upsides of the game, alongside an especially satisfactory voice acting with proper accents of the time. Character interactions and facial features are also appreciable. As an adventure game, Alter Ego is nothing extraordinary though. There are hardly any puzzles or actual item combinations. Items themselves are pretty obvious to encounter and gather too. As a mystery and crime investigation game though, it sure is noteworthy - especially the parts where we play as detective Bristol: gathering clues, interrogating witnesses and trying to guess the logic behind occurrences. The parts with Tim rely on story progression rather than mystery mainly and presents loose ends for detective Briscol eventually.\n\nIf you are to keep your expectations limited, Alter Ego is a nice experience with a really lame ending. It has some imaginative ideas, good character builds and a potentially interesting story if only it would be displayed a bit more elaborately. If you stumble upon it on a decent sale, why not?\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 13","true","8.9"," 44 of 45 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","44","45","0","3"

It could easily have been a great title but there are many things very wrong or badly done (mostly because of budget I suppose) like the cinematics and certain animations that are "lifeless" and feels very awkward. But in a point-and-click it isn't a main problem, what you want is a good narration and some mystery to solve. And it delivers in that regard with some really good design of places at the 19th century. I was surprised at how invested I was after a couple hours but that's mostly because I love this style of game and can put aside any type of gameplay to focus on the story. Which has many problems and holes (again probably budget) but still holds up for a decent story.\n\nI still recommand this game but certainly not for 20$ and certainly not to anyone. You must be very patient and already like this style of game. It is better after the first hour but don't expect too much. You should almost buy this with an intent to know how can this type of game can go right and wrong as it is very obvious in this one.\n\nI would say up to 5, maybe 10$ it isn't a steal, but only if you know what you're getting into.","November 27, 2013","true","7.0"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

The gameplay based on the classic click'n'point interaction and almost all puzzles are inventory based. The voiceovers are all fine except Tim who sounds a bit... dull. Almost all his voiceovers are done in the same tone so it sounds a bit out of place at some points.\n\nThe game will be easy for any player that usually plays these type of games and you can easily finish it in 5-7 hours. The story is good - it starts slowly but it picks up later with all the murders. Even though I've read most of the reviews for this game, and even though they all gave it a pretty bad score - the game really is good.\n\nHowever - the end of the game is really rushed. It does make sense, but the way it's presented is far from what it should be for this type of game. Also - you'll spend the last 30min of gameplay just going from location to location in a very speedy way because (i guess) devs ran out of time or money to make it interactive. The story at that point just rushes up till the point where the detective literally explains everything to you, what was really going on and who was behind the murders. The bad thing about it is that most of the info was never present in the game, or was mentioned very vaguely.\n\nAll in all - it's a good game and I recommend it to all adventure lovers","January 16, 2015","true","8.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

Good for those who like the point and click adventure genres, not good for those starting out in it. I think it's too expensive for what it is. If it was cheaper, it would be probably more worth a recommend.\n\nPros\n\nDetailed environments – lots of little things to look at\nVoice acting is nice, Irish and English accents!\n\nCons\n\nReally slow paced\n\nGameplay\n“Can you climb, naked man?” A point and click puzzle game, your character starts by escaping from a prison via a sewage/flood system, looking remarkably clean, if a little naked and handcuffed. He's a thief accosted by English constables, in a time where racial tensions between the Irish and English are at an all time high. When he picks up objects, they mysteriously disappear into his pants, and some of the animations are very slow ... and the character does have a slight habit of over explaining his actions during a successful “puzzle”, which could get annoying after a while. Yes smash the lock. No need to go further into it.\n\nThe character has a habit of reminding himself he can't do things or that something happened, or thinking that people are simple and how he needs to manipulate them – attributing to his thief-like character of dubious morals. Who also really dislikes hard work. Or work that requires effort in general. He's not a nice guy for sure, though entertaining in the way he interacts with people. You'll either like him or hate his guts. He seems to try and get around the game with his silver tongue. The dialogue between him and the woman who helps him out at the start is a little unbelievable, it progresses too conveniently. The accents are nice to listen to, though the main character is a little flat toned. But hey! Irish accents. It's very dialogue heavy so you'll spend a lot of time talking with characters and going through each talk option.\n\nThe environments are well rendered, they're not amazing but thought and detail has gone into it, from dirty basins to rust and pots and pans and objects lying around everywhere, giving the appearance of a run down, shabby and poor area. It's dilapidated and grimy, the less glamorous side of the Victorian style era, and this same level of detail persists in each scene you go into.\n\nThe game itself is a little too slow paced for me, things take too long to interact with, so I fast start losing interest in the adventure, despite the good environment, potential intriguing plot and interesting voice actors with their own quirks.\n\n\nWant to read more of my reviews?

There are ghastly murders happening, and in this point and click adventure, you will help to solve this case.\n\n\nThe character models are fairly well done for a low budget adventure game. They do somewhat clash with the backgrounds, at times not really seeming to actually be in the environment, but more like actors in front of a green screen. The videos are decently made, but the action and animation can look a little silly at times.\n\nCharacter movement can be really slow and plodding. Luckily you can double click to run to areas. However, every time you interact with an object the animations always feel like they take a little too long. Voice acting is not great, but also not in the so bad it's good category, so it's just kind of mediocre. It won't take you out of the story, but it won't do much for you. Puzzles are not too difficult thanks to the option to highlight all interactive items in the scene.\n\nI did not find the characters you play as or encounter to be terribly interesting. The dialogue sounds a bit awkward at times. The story wasn't really gripping, and unfortunately, about two hours in, I lost my save. I was not having enough fun and did not care enough about the story to make it through that progress again.\n\nThere are better point and click adventure games out there. If you get this in a bundle, try it out for a few minutes to see if the story interests you. The setting can be fun, as seen in the Sherlock Holmes games, but I found the story to be a bit lacking.\n\nGrade: D+","July 1, 2014","false","1.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Picking-up a box from the lowest shelf? Let's turn it into a puzzle! Nothing is too trivial for this game. Many of the items needed to solve the puzzles can't be picked unless a very specific trigger has already occured. You know the key is behind the statue, you can look at the statue, but the character would refuse just taking the key. As for the difficulty, most puzzles are of medium-low difficulty, and just require knowing *when* the time is right to solve one specific puzzle. I had everything I needed to make a certain paste, but it took another 30 minutes of gameplay between 1. Knowing that you need the paste, and 2. knowing where the paste needs to be applied, before you could get *water* to do it. So this should give you an example for both the "complexity" and annoyance of the puzzles.\n\nAlso, both characters are boring, pompous, and are mainly annoying. They pretty much have the same narcissistic personality, it just happen that one is a cop and the other is a criminal.\n\nThe plot is decent, and the atmosphere is rather good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cantiras/recommended/63110/","cantiras","Cantiras","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cantiras/","132 products in account","Alter Ego is a decent adventure game. It was branded by its developer as a "dark adventure game"; I don't consider it very dark, but it is atmospheric. The game is set in Plymouth, England in 1894. Throughout the game you alternate between two characters, Timothy Moor, a petty hood seeking to find a better life, and Detective Sergeant Briscol, a rigid agent of law and order.\n\nThere are a few technical issues with the game; most notable for me was probably the discrepancy between the character models' mouth movements and the spoken dialogue. Occasionally characters' mouths would move while there was no dialogue, or there would be dialogue, but no mouth movement, or the wrong character would be in sync with the speech. Also, when a playable character reflected in thought to himself, sometimes his mouth would move even though he was only thinking, or there would be slight reverberation to his internal monologue in some environments, as if he had spoken aloud. There were occasional differences between the subtitles and the spoken dialogue, as well as at least one mislabeled inventory item(at the beginning of the game, Tim's manacled wrists are labeled "lucky horseshoe", an item which doesn't appear until later in the game), but nothing irritatingly glaring. I think the same sound effect was employed for both walking and running, and there were a few other details-oriented issues like that which should have been polished out prior to the game's release.\n\nMuch like The Black Mirror (which was also developed by Future Games s.r.o.), Alter Ego revolves around a compelling atmosphere, and I liked the soundscape. I noticed that a few of the sound effects and music samples are reused from The Black Mirror, but I don't consider this an issue, as they are as equally at home in Alter Ego as they were in The Black Mirror. The voice acting was competent, and didn't cause distraction. [quasi-spoiler]Like The Black Mirror, Alter Ego has a f♥ck-you-for-playing ending that hardly rewards for the time invested.[/quasi-spoiler] I believe the game would have benefited from having multiple possible endings. Perhaps a sequel was intended.\n\nIf you don't enjoy adventure games, you should probably pass on this game. If you do enjoy adventure games and see Alter Ego on sale, consider giving it a try. I recommend watching a few videos of it first, in order to get a feel for it. I bought it when it was on sale, and I do not regret my purchase. In terms of pacing, Alter Ego somewhat reminded me of a few ICOM Simulations, Inc games (such as Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective, Dracula Unleashed, etc), that is to say that it is leisurely paced. As for navigational efficiency, double-clicking on an action item or other point on the screen will cause your character to run to it rather than stroll (Note: Tim can't run until his handcuffs have been removed). Double-clicking on an exit allows you to leave the current screen more quickly, rather than the playable character having to traverse the entirety of the distance to the exit, but unfortunately you can't access the map whenever you choose in order to jump to a different location, first you must exit the current location. When playing, you can display the active hotspots if you abhor pixel hunting, although without using the hotspot display feature I don't recall ever feeling like I had to tediously search around, plus the cursor turns red when hovering over a hotspot. Some of the tasks weren't straightforward, not in terms of being challenging, but in terms of defying real-world expectation, and there are also several tantalizingly unfinished plotlines; however, the story makes up for these shortcomings, in my opinion. For the most part the game flowed reasonably well, although the game does feel somewhat rushed and incomplete content-wise, like the developers had more planned than they had time or budget to execute.\n\nAlter Ego was the final release by Future Games before the studio closed. If you enjoyed an adventure game like Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, you might like Alter Ego. And if you like Alter Ego, you may wish to also check out The Black Mirror (when it is on sale), although the graphics of The Black Mirror are more dated. Black Mirror II: Reigning Evil & Black Mirror III: Final Fear were developed by a different studio (Cranberry Production GmbH), and while perhaps technically superior, aren't crafted in a way that is as appealing to me. I would have liked to see what Future Games could have done with more resources at its disposal.\n\nSCORE: 53 out of 100 - Fair\n\nSUMMARY: If you enjoy the occasional adventure game, this isn't a bad game to add to your collection if you pick it up it when it is on sale. If you only buy a couple of titles a year, or don't care for the adventure game genre, this likely isn't the game for you and you should put your money towards something else.\n\nADVISORY: "Fix for invisible characters in Alter Ego"","January 5, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just looking at the cover you would imagine the game follows some character who lives a double life; one as a good citizen, the other a darker kind of villain. I was expecting something along the lines of a Jekyll and Hyde game.\n\nInstead you play as two independent characters one an Irish rascal, the other a straight-laced English policeman. The game doesn't involve any problem solving but more like going from one place to another clicking on different things, and figuring out what to do next. The story is enjoyable whilst you're playing it, it unravells nicely and keeps you gripped.\n\nNothing however can really compensate for how poor the ending is. I'ts not simply that the ending is an unhappy one for both protagonists but it renders the whole story pointless.\n\nThere is one stupid part where you have to steal the ledger from a shop associated with the villain. This involves:\n1. Walking outside from the church\n2. Walking outside the main gates\n3. Walking from outside the main gates to outside the shop.\n4. Click on the door.\nAnd thats it. After you click on the door you're automatically sent back to the church after a brief monologue and tell you're partner "Here you go, I've got the account book" (not the exact wording, but that's basically what happens). Stupid, utterly stupid.\n\nThere are far better point and clicks out there. Find anohter.","May 27, 2014","false","11.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tinyturtle/recommended/63110/","tinyturtle","Tiny Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tinyturtle/","870 products in account","So this is a surprisingly hard review to make, largely because there aren't many negative things to say about this game. It's a little old, sure, and with that can come technical problems and dated visuals, but that's something one has to expect. The awkward animations are actually a little charming, seeing how far the technologies have come since then. What is surprising though is how well the backgrounds and settings hold up. Although, yes, they tend to be a little colourless and depressing, they're gorgeously drawn and come in a crisp, high resolution. I'm kind of a stickler when it comes to 2D texture working, especially with these kinds of 3D/2D adventure games, and this one did not fail to satisfy me.\n\nThe character's are voice acted well enough; some of the lines suffer from being read from a script rather than spoken naturally, but the overall quality is just fine. Not a single character is offensive, even the ones that follow pretty blatant stereotypes. The ruffian, the evil minion, the sassy protagonist. I rather enjoyed them and the personalities they carried. Like the voice acting, the story isn't anything ground breaking or shocking. It telegraphs coming twists pretty blatantly and yet it never feels like it detracts from the game. All of this just sort of exists around the real meat of it.\n\nThat being, of course, the puzzles. This is a very genuine point & click adventure / puzzle game and I adore it for it. The puzzles are great! A few of them do follow a bizarre sort of adventure-game logic, but they never go without subtle (or overt) hinting, and when you're stuck you can always get past it just by looking around, talking to people and inspecting your inventory. My main driving force in this game was always just to solve the puzzle and get to the next one. Really, this is where the game shines, and I don't regret a moment spent playing it.\n\nI do wish there's more I could say about it, really. I've spent hours and hours in it already and I feel like it deserves this big fat review. There just isn't much more to it, and that is in no way a detractor. If you're out for a point & click puzzler, you could do a lot worse than this. :]","February 1, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At least, that's how it felt.\n\nThe game's title is in reference to the fact that the focus swaps between two separate POV characters. One is an Irish pickpocket with plans to travel to America with his best mate (with voice acting that is uniformly and bizarrely listless and monotone). The other is a new detective who is caught up in a murder investigation on his very first day on the job.\n\nThe story is intriguing and the mystery will keep you guessing for much of the game. Not that you can possibly solve it, but you can at least make wild guesses that will almost assuredly be utterly inaccurate. It's not your fault; that's how it was written.\n\nThe gameplay is very linear and the puzzles vary from snoozingly simplistic to vaguely difficult, and none of them should be particularly hard to overcome, though some are easy to overlook if you forget to talk to someone or inspect an intem in your inventory properly.\n\nOther than the primary POV character, the voice acting is actually quite good, and the art is very well done. (well, other than the point at which the good detective is standing upon the hand of a murder victim, anyway) There is very little music other than during the cut scenes, which are not particularly obtrusive and do serve to fill out scenes between gameplay quite nicely.\n\nThere are subtitles, so you can skip forward, and nearly all dialogue during gameplay can be repeated, so if you miss something, you can go back through. However, you can't replay cut scenes or a few auto-play moments, so don't skip forward. Especially near the end. Also, there are a number of scenes where the subtitles aren't in boxes but rather are actually cut off at the bottom of the screen, making them rather difficult to read. A couple of "leave area" hot spots have that same issue.\n\nSpeaking of the end, don't blink or you'll miss it and find yourself staring at the main menu (not even credits) wondering what in the everloving hell just happened. To say that it is abrupt is putting it mildly. And even if it were longer, it would be no less unsatisfying and jarring. It looks suspiciously like there was a plan for a sequel, however the studio closed the year after this game was released, so there is no hope of the terrible ending ever being mitigated. (I don't know if they ran out of money and that's why they ended it this way, or if this game killed the studio in revenge for that ending)\n\nI'd take the ME3 ending over this and be happy, it's just that atrocious.\n\nThe Good:\n* Voice Acting is quite well done, with one unfortunately major exception\n* Tone is fairly even, despite the swap between POV protagonists\n* The puzzles aren't terribly difficult, though they can be a bit simplistic at times\n\nThe Bad:\n* Having music during gameplay would go a long way\n* Walking takes forever and there's rather too much of it\n* There are plot threads and hot spots that never get resolved\n* Neither of the protagonists is particularly likeable, so playing as them is kind of grating\n\nThe Ugly:\n* That horribad ending... WTF?!?\n\nRating: 58%\nThis game could come in at a solid 75% or so if it weren't for the few notable flaws. It loses a full 10% for the ending alone, plus another 5% for Tim's voice actor sleeping-walking through the entire adventure. The slow pace and uneven quality on the subtitles and controls take out a few more percentage points. It had the makings of a solid, if unremarkable adventure game, and most of the time, that's what you've got. Unfortunately, it's flaws are unavoidable, and thus I can't in good consience give it more than the most tepid of recommendations. If I could give it a Null Recommendation, I would.\n\nTLDR: It's ok enough, but you've been warned about the primary POV's sleep-inducing delivery and that ending... that terrible, execrable ending... >_<","September 9, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It starts with a good story but the delivery becomes very rushed.You'll enjoy the first half, while the second half will be a bad audio novel.\nIf you're a fan of the genre, the game will for sure hook you in. It is very engrossing I had to play it in one go to see what happens.\nIf it's on sale, check it out.\n\n\n*Spoiler*\nI was very upset with the ending. They're both equally despicable, but neither deserved what they got, Too bad when Tim seemd to get a change in moral, he had to..you know...and not to forget that pompous detective what a way to go...","September 19, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels like they phoned in most of it\nThe main character is a bit of a ♥♥♥♥ so not everyone will be able to identify with him\n\nThe ugly:\nThe voice acting is pretty terrible - I turned it off in no time and pretended it was an old DOS adventure game\n\nI played this game years ago and it hasn't really aged that much - but its flaws are still there today as well. It's a pretty straight forward adventure games but it doesn't really stand out. The voice acting specifically drags the game down. Your character shouldn't sound like he can't be bothered to read his lines. Even the developers knew this because the trailer doesn't contain a single spoken word!","September 16, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing as two different protagonists, each very well designed with near opposite personalities and extravagant character flaws, yet manage to be extremely engaging while still dis-likable. Easy to play, good controls, characters can run and it'll auto-jump to the next screen.\n\nTwo complaints, though they cotain minor spoilers.\nOne major annoyance is that the dialogue keeps referring to the main dead character being buried alive. Buried alive...buried alive...over and over. But he was never buried alive. He was entombed. Above ground, in a tomb. Ugggg.\n\nAlso WTF happened to the ending. The whole time the story builds towards some alter ego/jeykll hyde type reveal but then ends up going no where. No where at all. There was no ending. Blah!!!\n\nYet, aside from the above two complaints I still really enjoyed this game. I had fun and I'm glad I played it. Totally worth whatever cheapie sale price for which I'm sure it was bought.","March 4","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The handdrawn background graphics are beautiful and the voice acting is good too. The only thing that sucks is the abrubt ending and the parts of the story that didn't make sense and where never explained.\n\nThe company which produced the game went bankrupt afterwards. So i guess they went out of money while developing and released an unfinished game to counteract the bancruptcy...\n\nWell i still give the game a recommendation because up until the ending it was quiet good.","February 11","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game perfectly restores that feeling; the two main protagonists are very far from out 21st politically-correct century.  The beautiful landscapes really solidify this grim atmosphere.\n\nThe gameplay follows the Point-and-Click adventure genre, with subtle differences.  Some actions will not be possible, or will have different outcomes, depending on what actions you have performed earlier.  This makes you re-visit and re-explore places and items that you've already seen.  In exchange, items and locations will simply cease to become clickable once you are done with them, encouraging you to focus your efforts where it matters.  This keeps the possibility space small enough to avoid getting completely stuck.  Important: sometimes, you will need to time your actions properly; for example you will have to wait for someone to look away in order to succeed in your action.\n\nThe UI is slightly inconsistent, but in no way game-breaking.  I also noticed some unfortunate typos that cannot be attributed to the poor language of the characters.  One extra layer of polish would have been nice, but the story usually captures you again very quickly and you don't remain bothered by it.\n\nThe story surprised me a few times.  I used my meta-game knowledge to predict what was going on, only to realize later that I was wrong.  It breaks a lot of tropes.  It's hard to say more without spoiling, but I consider it a good thing.\n\nIt took me ten hours to finish the game (I've got 13 hours recorded because I had to restart playing on another computer after three hours, there is no sync to store your saves on the cloud).  There were no silly puzzles; some puzzles were there just for the sake of being puzzles, but all had a reasonable solution.\n\nOverall, I had a pleasant experience, in a dark and creepy way.","May 20","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
