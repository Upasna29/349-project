He sat on my lap while we made a rocket. He asked questions about rockets. We made it into space and he asked, "Are we in space?" We came down and the friction caused our heat shield to glow. His eyes were wide open as we slowed down. We pressed the space bar to deploy our parachutes but were going too fast and our chutes failed. We crashed and he asked if the kerbal was OK. I said yes as I hit ESC and went back to the VAB and changed a few things. A few minutes later, we landed our capsule safely and he had the biggest smile on his face.

How is it possible?"\n\nTwo years ago, I would have answered "yes, but I don't really know how.  It's very complicated, with lots of math and science.  You might learn about it in a physics class in 10 years time."\n\nInstead, I answered "Here, let me show you." and fired up Kerbal Space Program.  We built a moon rocket and launched it, me steering and she hitting the separation detonation buttons when needed.  30 minutes later we had landed on the moon.\n\nThank you, Squad, for enabling me to give that answer.","March 19, 2014","true","182.5"," 4,052 of 4,170 people (97%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","97","052","4","20","82"

Bored of building rockets? Build a space plane! Fed up of the mun? Go to Duna! Don't want to leave the atmosphere? Build whatever you want! The list goes on!\n\nFantastic modding community and fantastic mods. So much more expansion on an already amazing game.\n\nFantastic community in general, some of the nicest people I've met have came from this game. They are such a helpful bunch and I'm glad I'm with them! They'll most likely love to help you. There's also a bunch of fantastic YouTubers such as Scott Manley and others... (too many to name) :)\n\nYOU CAN LEARN STUFF FROM THIS AND GAIN NEW INTERESTS! Before I played this I had no interest in space or space exploration whatsoever but now I actively follow space news and am quite knowledgable on the subject. I have also learnt a fantastic deal of orbital mechanics just from playing and learning the game.\n\nCons:\n\nThe engine and optimisation. This game uses Unity and it only uses 1 CPU core. This can be a major problem if running a multicore with low clock speed. The 32bit version of the game is a whole lot more stable but limits your RAM meaning that if you have a ton of mods you can run into a lot of crashes but thankfully there are mods out there such as ATM (Active Texture Management) and texture replacer to limit the amount of RAM the game uses. 64bit as of now is still pretty unstable with mods.\n\nThe learning curve and tutorials. The learning curve on this game is huge, I'm not complaining much about this one as rocket science isn't exactly easy is it? You can learn from trial and error and it's how I learnt alot but some things you just have to read up about or watch a tutorial on youtube. There isn't really much of a tutorial in game either.\n\nConclusion: Buy it. It's really fantastic.","February 26, 2015","true","799.8"," 1,681 of 1,710 people (98%) found this review helpful 1,342 people found this review funny","98","681","1","342","25"

If you are in the market for some fast-paced "space combat sim" with all kinds of weapons and big explosions, then this isn't what you are looking for.  (Except for the big explosions... KSP has you covered there).\n\nHowever, if you ever dreamed of actually being an astronaut, this is definitely for you.  If you sometimes forget to breath when watching recordings of the Apollo moon landings, this is definitely for you.  If precise, measured flying; careful planning; and delta-v budgeting are what drives you, this is definitely for you.  If you want to learn about Orbital Mechanics and are dying to know what the Oberth Effect or a Hofman Transfer Orbit are, this is definitely for you. If you like Physics, this is definitely for you.\n\nOptionally, if you just like building rediculously large rockets and watching them explode with glorious comedy when they fail catastrophically because you forgot ONE PART... then this is also definitely for you.\n\nKerbal Space Program is challenging, fun, frustrating, mind boggling, huge, hilarious, complicated, deep, and just plain awesome.","June 11, 2015","true","522.0"," 1,477 of 1,506 people (98%) found this review helpful 302 people found this review funny","98","477","1","302","14"

Additionally, there are several user created mods that really expand on the experience, adding new parts or game mechanics.\nBuilt off of real physics! One doesn't just lop space junk up into the sky; one must deliver that space junk the realistic and correct way, thus rendering Kepler and Newton proud!!! (generally speaking, it allows one to see how actual launches and orbits work in the real world)\nMany other great aspects to this game (however, this would be a long list with all of them)The Bad   Graphics aren't the best, however, they are still good and create a real sense of depth and can deliver a "lost-in-space" kind of a feel... It makes me feel so small compared to the vastness of our world. Plus, the graphical style really fits the style of the overall game.\n\nSomewhat steep learning curve- It took me a while to learn to get to the "Mun." After this achievement, it was a lot easier to get to Minmus after this. It was difficult to get to Duna, however, once I got there, I have gradually learned enough to go pretty much anywhere and have made a permanent base on Laythe complete with science lab, crew pod and a brand spanking new air breathing engine jet transport, as well as a souped up Rover for them to drive. I have been to almost all of the planets. So basically, it takes time to get "good" at this game, but I assure you, it's rewarding and so spectacular to see how huge this world is (And this one is scaled down, too!). However, new tutorials should be very helpful for the beginner.\n\nnot too much music (it's still good, just gets repetitive sometimes) (*ahem* devs please add more music)\n\nGetting to further out planets can take a long time, because it is a little more difficult and takes more resourcefulness... (several hours if your like me and really take your time, especially if you send a 3 manned mission to Eeloo... [you'll get faster the more experience you get though])\nOverall, this is a wonderful simulator offering a lot of real science with fun, providing lots of hours of engaging gameplay. I am so happy the developers have successfully brought this amazing game out of beta. I have purchased this game so long ago, and the updates have vastly improved the game and have solved many of the problems I have dealt with. Thank you for reading this book of a review, and I hope this really helps. Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions, I have over 400 hours logged and played the demo for several hours. I will try to get to them as soon as possible.

I love this game, its learning curve and its modability.\n\nHere a few pointers to help you decide:\n\n1. If you love astronomy and space exploration, this game is for you!\nYou can do everything you have read and fantasized about. Build any rocket, no matter how stupid the concept may look at first and then try it out in the cold hard reality of space.\n\n2. The game has a very steep learning curve and will constantly challenge you.\nYou will learn a lot about orbital mechanics, why staging is absolutely necessary and how to conserve fuel. If you don't, you probably won't make it into orbit, much less to the Mun or even other planets. Even after more than 600 hours of playing Kerbal Space Program, I'm learning stuff the hard way by losing vehicles and Kerbals.\n\n3. The game developers actively encourage modding and the modding community is breathtakingly awesome.\nThe modability of this game is the hidden strength of this game. Without it, I wouldn't have played it half the time I actually did and wouldn't have enjoyed it as much at the same time.\n\nThe first time you play through the career mode (meaning you unlock all the technologies) you should play it without any mods, just to learn the basics, look how the game behaves, etc., but after that you should really check out the Kerbal Space Program forums mod section (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/35-Add-on-Releases-and-Projects-Showcase ), KerbalStuff (http://beta.kerbalstuff.com/ ) and/or the Curse Mod Page (http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal ). There's mods for so many aspects of the game...\nWant to play in more realistic solar system where it's harder to even get into orbit? Check.\nWant to have more realistic (= punishing) aerodynamics? Check.\nWant to have rocket parts for even larger rockets? Check.\nWant to have some autopilot capabilities to assist you with repetitive tasks? Check.\nWant to mine for fuel and ores on distant celestial bodies? Check.\nWant to have a warp drive? Also check.\n\nThere's so many more which you should probably explore for yourself. The replayability of this game is great, thanks to all those mods. The community forums are also really great and helpful.\nIf you play this game, please make sure you don't forget to mod it at some point, really!\n\nYou should not play this game,\n- if you don't like space sims to be too realistic. Again: You will have to learn at least basic orbital mechanics which means the strongest force around is not your ship's drive, but gravity. And a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥ she is indeed...\n- if you don't enjoy learning stuff the hard way by explosions, disintegrations and death. There is no perfect rocket. At some point stuff will blow up and you will have to start a whole mission again.\n- if you don't like games that are still in development. There will be new versions released every now and then, so things change from time to time. For example, when the game was upgraded from 0.22 to 0.23, the whole science system got a rework and a lot of my rockets that were built specifically for science grinding became useless. The update was great though, since it got rid of grinding altogether.\n\nI hope you enjoy this game as much as I still do. :)","November 25, 2013","true","686.9"," 732 of 761 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","732","761","0","13"

If you need more help, the YouTube scene is quite impressive, with people like Scott Manley producing really professional (and charming) video tutorial series. I am not a lover of simulation-type games, I play mostly FPS's and RPG's, but I found this game quite easy to pick and up get into.\n\n* while approachable, this game is certainly not easy, for example, landing and returning from Eve (the Venus-like planet in the Kerbin system) is one of the hardest tasks in the game, and while most of the game is fairly non-stressful in its nature, landing spaceships is a tense experience, especially when Jeb's life is on the line! For those that find it difficult to master some of the more difficult tasks, there are impressive control mods like MechJeb2 where you essentially point at a spot on a planet and press the "Land There" button, MechJeb does the rest.\n\n* the game has a unique charm to it, in the game you are progressing through the space race for the people of the Kerbin panet, you'll get to know and love the kerbalnauts that will fly your craft, especially Jebediah Kerman, pilot extraordinaire and fearless hero to the Kerbin people\n\n* the community for this game, is active, organized, and quite friendly, mostly found on Reddit and the Squad forums, you can get any question answered, or read mission reports from someone's latest mission, or get news on upcoming updates for the game. The only time you see people getting belligerent on these forums is when some is misbehaving toward others\nSquad is actively developing this game, each release (every new months) bringing a lot of new features and parts to build with, and just this week the update to KSP brings many new rocket parts built in collaboration with NASA plus a mission to save Kerbin from killer asteroids!\n\n* the mod scene for this game is extremely impressive, from new real-life inspired rocket parts (so you can build your own Saturn V), to impressive new systems that enable for example planetary mining (so you can get more fuel on route to your target), to just plain fun mods like the nuclear pulse rocket, which explodes varied-sized nuclear bombs behind a large plate to produce thrust (scientists actually design this beast in the 50's)\n\n* the endgame is rich and deep: once you've completed career mode, many KSP players switch to the realism mods, which give you the real solar system, truly deadly reentries, realistic communication constraints (that require building satellite networks), more realistic aerodynamics modeling (e.g., Ferram's amazing FAR mod), real life-support constraints, etc. that make for a significantly more challenging and rewarding experience; if that doesn't trip your trigger, the forums have organized challenges with leaderboards, to see who can, for example, get to the Mun with the least number of parts, or eject the most Kerbals out of the solar system, all great fun with the competitors meticulously documenting their missions\n\nIf these things sound interesting to you, get this game!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_kwip_/recommended/220200/","_kwip_","KWiP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_kwip_/","417 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nKerbal Space Program is essentially NASA by trial and error. All the fun of building things and launching them into space, without the hassle of acquiring funding or the responsibility of having to return people to Earth safely.\n\nThe Kerbals are a race of little green humanoids who love space. More than anything else, they want to go to there. You can get them there by designing rockets and space planes of near-unlimited complexity (read: convolutedness), and testing them out. Some of your designs will succeed, and some will experience a "rapid unplanned vehicle disassembly." But that's half the fun.\n\nOnce you get the hang of getting things off the ground, you can really start to see how incredibly in-depth this game is. There is an entire solar system modeled here, with 7 planets and a bunch of moons orbiting them, giving you tons to do -- enough for hundreds of hours of play. As of this writing, I'm over 100 hours spent in-game, and the furthest I've gotten from Kerbin (the Earth-analog starting planet) is Eve, one of the nearest planets (and even then, I was forced to watch helplessly as the craft crashed into the surface, having spent all of its fuel on the voyage there).\n\nThe game's physics are -- while scaled down for difficulty's sake -- actually fairly realistic. I never realized how little I knew about the physics involved in orbits until I started figuring out how to save fuel during launch by focusing more on horizontal velocity. Before long, I was looking up how to do gravity assists to get to other planets, and looking up actual rocket science formulas, trying to understand the principles behind them in order to improve my designs.\n\nThe game is still in Alpha, and as such it's a little rough around the edges (the most obvious to me is that the surface of Kerbin is devoid of any kind of structures besides the space center), but new updates are coming out with decent regularity. Most recently added is the career mode, which starts you out only with a handful of parts, requiring you to perform experiments and generate reports around the solar system to gain "science" -- a currency you can use to unlock new part selections. The part limitations give a new kind of challenge, and obtaining science gives the game a more objective focus, which I found very refreshing -- especially just as sandbox mode was starting to lose some of its draw.\n\nTL:DR;\nIf designing and flying rockets, space planes and/or whatever ridiculous contraption you can think of sounds fun, it's a safe bet that you'll enjoy this game. Despite still being in alpha, it's already more than worth what I paid.","November 1, 2013","true","188.4"," 640 of 670 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","640","670","0","0"

You will, in a terribly entertaining way, learn some fundamental of orbital mechanics, rocket science, aerodynamics, astrophysics and even a bit of mechanical engineering and straight physics.\n\nThere is nobody to shoot, no zombies, no monsters, no combat. No grand conquests and raising flags over captured enemy bases. Yet you have never and will never play a game that will challenge, entertain and reward you like KSP will. The learning curve is stiff but not terrible. You play it at your own pace because, well, there is no other pace you can play it at. Games like Dark Souls are 'hard' because you've got to have the right mix of luck and muscle memory and you have to throw yourself at it again again. KSP can be hard because calculating the right setup for the right injection burn to put you in a viable position to get past Ike into a stable orbit around Duna with enough fuel to get you home is a staggering undertaking, a lot of planning and forethough.\n\nThis is one of those games that changes gaming. You will kick yourself, repeatedly, when you look back and realize you didn't have a chance to play KSP.\n\nIt is a complex, indepth, engaging, well balanced and changing but simplified to make it fun to play simulator for building and deploying rockets and ships to go into space, visit and explore other worlds and travel a solar system.\n\nThe developer is a big part of this success. One of the first trail blazers on 'early access' they have been amazing for involving the community. Several of the top modders for KSP (they love and support modding in KSP - not to fix bugs but add content) were engaged and used in building content for the 1.0 release even. They are still engaged in improving and adding content to KSP.\n\nI've got close to 800 hours in at this point and still haven't really played swaths of the game, there are dozens of mods I want to try but haven't had the chance. This is the kind of game that's fun and engaging for years and years. Sometimes you need to step outside the regular run of the mill and see why a game like this has tens of thousands of reviews that are almost universally positive.","April 28, 2015","true","868.7"," 423 of 433 people (98%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","98","423","433","30","12"

Failure is the only option.\n\nMost of your best stories will have nothing to do with what went right on a standard planet-to-planet maneuver, or how you really nailed that Hohmann transfer. No, it'll probably be the flaming wreckage you created where no one should have survived, but somehow did. My game once glitched as a Kerbal was falling from the upper atmosphere and he bounced on the surface. He bounced! And not in the crumpled heap of flesh and bone matter way. He bounced off the ground and appeared to be coming in for a graceful finish to a mission gone horribly wrong--the only type of mission that truly exists. He fell from space! And lived! Forget space, erect a statue!\n\nMy first manned mission to the Mun ended in predictable failure. I tried landing without any sort of landing gear. How, you might ask? By landing on the engine so it was primed for vertical takeoff. I forgot about my horizontal velocity, however, and ended up ripping the engine apart. I had all the fuel I needed for a return mission, but the broken engine was left kilometers away. Oops. At least I could plant a cool flag.\n\nI attempted a rescue mission, because that is the first irresponsible thing everyone always thinks to do: stranded person in space? Send more people to help them! The first mission collided with the Mun at 600 m/s. Rough landing. The second mission landed, but I was probably 50km away--which isn't all that bad, all things considered. I had the stranded Kerbal run toward the landed ship, but it was taking forever. So I started using his little jetpack to expedite things. Lemons and lemonade. As it turns out, you can actually disintegrate a Kerbal if you get too much forward momentum and collide with something solid, like the surface of the Mun. You will forever be in our thoughts, Mac Kerman.\n\nSo much for the rescue. I may as well have the rescue team return safely. Remember that landing gear part? Yeah, I still hadn't updated that section of the ship. Instead I landed on my side and planned on using elevation as a natural ramp. Bulletproof logic. At least this Kerbal had the dignity of a fiery, fiery death. An honorable death. By my own hands.\n\nIn KSP, your little Kerbal guys can die and be listed in the ambiguous "Lost" column. It was with great sorrow that I saw Mac Kerman's name in there. I didn't care so much about the other guys. Who cares about the second guy on the Mun? But here's the thing, several years into my career mode Mac magically reappeared and was ready for action! He came back from the dead! And what was the first thing he wanted to do? Go back into space! To die again!\n\nIn conclusion, yes to this game. Just yes. I currently have a Kerbal orbiting the second moon, Minmus. Yes, he is in a stable orbit without a ship. Just him. And he's been there for close to 30 years now. I'll get around to that at some point.","November 23, 2014","true","114.5"," 339 of 344 people (99%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","99","339","344","28","11"

After many updates, it has grown into an immensely satisfying personal sandbox space programme simulator.\n\nThe first time I landed a Kerbal safely on the Mun was a historic moment, and very emotional... until moments later when I wondered how Jebediah would possibly get back. Swiftly, a rescue mission was devised. Hours were spent meticulously over-engineering an overly capable craft, until I realised I felt quite hungry. I couldn't decide what to eat, when I noticed the name of the planet Mars equivalent. Seeing it as almost divine inspiration, I went out and got a Duna kebab. Very satisfied with the food the game chose for me, I spent the next few hours trying to fly the monstrosity that could only barely be called a "return vehicle" without: 1) exploding on launch. 2) tipping over and exploding whilst landing. After many reverts and quickloads, it was finally successful. A celebratory viewing of Apollo 13 ensued, followed with feverish design work on the next, more ambitious project. And then it was 6am.\n\nThe game is far too addictive.\n\nI now wish I had studied aero engineering instead.\n\nThere is a full solar system to obtain science on explore, with lots of ways to do it. Contraptions which can only be described as "adorably ridiculous" yet surprisingly effective may be constructed to your heart's content. As with many other sandbox games, you provide your own amusement - set yourself ridiculous tasks and restrictions, be efficient or over-engineer the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything such that the Littoral Combat Ship looks like a very sound and practical design.\n\nWith or without mods (of which there are many), you can build almost anything from planes and land vehicles to giant flying space horses and bananas.\n\nOfficial multiplayer support in the future was announced a while ago, and there is currently a multiplayer mod that allows you to build space stations or conduct joint missions with friends and partner agencies.\n\nIt is still currently in development, with more and more features being added with each major update. Even in its current state, I would be more than happy to pay double its current full price based on how much enjoyment I have gotten out of it.\n\nTL;DR: Spectacular failures, decided what I should have to eat one day and now I regret my key life decisions.

It exceeds all expectations. The game isn't finished yet, but I don't care. They can't fail anything anymore. Just buy it. Or wait for a sale and then buy it. Whenever you buy it, you won't feel ripped off! I guarantee you that!\n\nKerbal Space Program is pure MAGIC! On the facade it comes across as something with the depth of Angry Birds and the looks of a crappy looking 3d rollercoaster tycoon and the unsuspecting gamer is easily fooled. However, there is a reason this game has a fanbase of millions! There's a reason I'm scoring this game 12 out of 10. I find this game to be the most addictive thing in my library. I even try NOT to play it, but when I do it keeps me awake at night and busy while doing daily chores...\n\nKSP, like the name might have hinted, is a Space Program Simulator Game. There is the career mode, involving missions and research, and there is the sandbox mode that allows you to run free with it. The game is in early access and the career needs work (I find the missions redundant and confusing, but it's already fun), and this review is more about the sandbox mode.\n\nYou run the show, so you set out your own missions, like fly to the moon or another planet. Then you have to build your lander, rover, satelite or whatever, the means of manouvering in space and a rocket to get it in space! Then you have to find out not just how to get something off the ground and into space, you also need to learn to make an orbit. Then you learn how to manipulate orbits in order to get around. There are no concessions! By the time you've figured out how to get where you want to go, you will have learned the basics of actual spaceflight! You don't need a science degree to do this and to understand this, the game is brilliant this way. You can get there by trial and error and in a fun way too.\n\nI recommend this game to all people that like simulation games, tycoon games, Lego (the plastic bricks), science fiction in general, science in general, rockets and blowing stuff up, real space exploration or even have slight positive stance on looking at the sky at night willing to learn.\n\nAs you set out your own missions, you send your Kerbal individuals (they all have names) on grand adventures. Their homeworld has a cicumference of about 12000km and it comes with 2 moons. The bigger one looks like our own moon and it can even cast a solar eclipse (really a fun and beautifull feature). In the Kerbol (name of the star) system you will also find the planets Moho, Eve with it's moon Gilly, Kerbin with Mun and Minmus, Duna with Ike, then a gas-giant called Jool with no less then 5 moons plus finally the dwarfplanet Eelo. The distances are measured in millions of kilometers when traveling in space. It may be a scaled down planetary system, but that doesn't mean it's small. I have never before adventured through such an immense ingame world. Each planet and moon comes with it's own biomes and anomalies to discover and explore and you'll busy for hundreds of hours before you've done it all. Everyone plays in this same systen so everyone can share their adventures with eachother, you know what the other player is talking about.\n\nWhen I started playing, I had little expectations. It looked like a mod, but then I reached space. It was like the opening of the movie 2001: a Space Oddisey. The "space whales" ingame music started playing and my contraption was floating in a serene fashion high above kerbin, ever going higher and higher, kerbin getting smaller and smaller, I passed the Mun... lost kerbin, then found the "eva" button.. I found out stands for "Extra Vehicular Activity", or "Go play outside".. so I lost my Kerbal. Hours of my life passed by while staring at this phenomenon called KSP, while drooling over my keyboard.\n\nThis game is not done yet. I'm not sure when they aim for a release candidate, but they can't fail this anymore. Nasa has made an addon for it, so now asteroids are also part of the game and can be landed on or grabbed. Nasa also added their own rocket parts based on the new Space-X rocket, how awesome is that! And the developer has even announced multiplayer!!! I don't know how this will work and what we could do in an online game, and It's already more fun if a friend plays this game too, but it's anticipated by me nonetheless.\n\nThe educational value of this game is through the roof! I thought I understood the principle of orbits, but boy did I learn a lot. I understood the concept of flying faster horizontally then you fell vertically, but putting it to practice requires more then just going. So, I watched Nasa do it. They pivot the rocket as soon as it has picked up enough speed, so ok... I built a rocket with steering parts and pivotted it correctly after a few try-outs and finally worked out an eliptical orbit to play with. At this point the concept that Isaac Newton put down of "every action has a 'pose and equal reaction" gets a whole new meaning in orbit (you'll see :KSmiley:).\n\nEvery run you make in Kerbal, you get more advanced. Your rockets become more stable, because you know how to make them, you get to other planets faster, because you know how to get there. My rockets grew in size from around 60 parts for the rocket with my first moonlander, of which I built a new version every night, to about 1300 in my rocket plus massive oversized truck I landed on Duna, which took me 2 weeks to build! It went from slapping together a simple contraption to a mind-boggling engineering puzzle that even my pc (or the game's engine) found hard to process when launched.\n\nThere comes a point where you get stuck on something, like how to dock in space. There are several things to do, but I warn you: this can make or break your experience. Try as hard as you can if you're stuck, play with a friend (you know, together on one pc thinking and building) and if all else fails, then try youtube or a guide. Letting guides take you by the hand can ruin your experience. But when you've reached this point it just means a whole new world of Kerbal opens before your eyes. I think every KSP player has posted screenshots, videos, guides both online and private to friends. The ammount of material you can dig up is staggering.\n\nAlso, don't install mods as you just start playing, exept for scan-sat perhaps (but don't, the other mods will lure you). Mods potentially ruins the experience as they can either make it to hard or too easy. I've reached the point where making an orbit has become a boring thing to do and I had seen all the parts ingame. I've reached the point of not getting my ships docked. This was the point where I looked on youtube, read guides and reviews for mods and then installed mods, mods like MechJeb (in flight telemetry and autopilot options, use at your own risk), advanced cockpits (cockpit screens, buttons to press, external cameras, awesome!), more parts, graphical addons, scan-sat (scans planets, awesome!), etc. But with all games in early access, mods can be broken when the game is patched. But when you've reached that point, KSP can be enhanced in such ways it brings about limitless posibilities, as realistic as you want it to be.\n\nThis game is 100% quality, dedicated hard work and deserves all credit it can get. When it's done, it just means it has reached a point where the developers can call it a complete game. With more standard parts, more physics, more career, more tycoon and basicly more game then it is now. From that moment this game will only expand as if it were the universe itself thanks to mods and I don't think this game will die out soon. Just buy the game, you'll have fun for years to come I promiss!!!\n\nIf it's not on sale, check out Steamhookups.com if there's a good deal in it for you!","January 15, 2014","true","302.7"," 398 of 417 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","398","417","0","1"

Four long years of development, cool stuff, accidentally education, and the Kraken... and here we are. One point oh (point whatever!) And oh, are things different! But that's all the past! Let's talk about the present.\n\nThis is a game in which you go to space repeatedly, success optional.\n\nMost of the entertainment value in this game is either limited or boosted by your imagination. You can just throw some bits together, hit the go button and see what happens! What's that? There are Kerbals in there? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of my massive explosion device. Conversely, you can put things together in a very particular manner and create the perfect interplanetary shuttle. It's all up to you. Your sandbox is the solar system. Go play. Due to the nature of things and such, this game would be truly incredible in a classroom environment, yet it's just as fun alone at home.\n\nNow, for the less sandbox-oriented among us (or just the people like me who enjoy progression,) there's a career mode! This time, you start out with the exclusive ability to make short range, manned, ballistic missiles! FOR SCIENCE! Seriously, you generate Science! from everything, and you use it to unlock more things to build better missiles to make more Science! Be careful though. Don't want to blow up too many bits, because you have funding to worry about now. You should also take care of your Kerbals to keep your reputation acceptable.\n\nAlso the camera shakes, there's complicated aerodynamics, there's thermodynamics, there's moresodynamics, there's orbital mechanics, there's resource mining (which you can MAKE FUEL with,) there's management, there's pretty explosions, there's good sound effects that are also deafening, there's accidentally education, and so much more for only some money!\n\nHowever, the tutorial is absolutely useless and frustrating. Ignore it, fumble around for a while, and utilize the internet to learn what you must know when you decide that trial and error is so last era.\n\nThere's not really much else to talk about...

The screen shakes and aside from the roar of liftoff, the only thing you can hear is your own labored breathing and the pulse in your ears.  Do you have this picture in your head?  Good.\n\nBecause KSP is nothing like that.   Take parts, attach parts, launch parts, land parts, detonate parts, survive falling parts.  KSP is learning through failure.  Unless you go on Youtube and look up the Scott Manley videos, you are going to fail.  You gonna fail bad.  But it's okay.  Failure is only data by another name.  Bit by bit, you'll learn how to do things right.  You'll realize that putting the engines under the tanks is probably a good idea.  Putting the crew capsule in a place not likely to be burned or detonated is also probably a good idea.   Parachutes seem like a logical choice, but what the heck, right?  Maybe you just need a five hundred meter long crumple zone.  Nobody's gonna stop you.  That's the great thing, isn't it?  You can put anything at all you want on the launchpad, and nobody knows well enough to try to stop you.  The Kerbish OSHA rep is permanently locked into the bathroom.  He's not gettin' out of there.  We welded the window shut, locked the door, and put model airplane glue in the keyhole.  Cell phone reception in there is sketchy.  You're safe.  So go nuts.\n\nThere's places you can go.  Land at the poles, the sea, the mountains, or all three at once with a creatively timed spray of shrapnel.  There's other worlds.  A big burning thing with no surface that'll tan you for free if you check it out.  It'll tan you to the bone.  So that's a bonus.  There's other worlds.  Red world.  Purple world.  Green world with little worlds around it.  Hidden stuff everywhere.  All of these places are fit to seed with refuse.  Landers, rovers, living quarters, stations, battleships, pasteboard furniture, lawnmowers, spaceplanes, robots, scooters, springboards, et cetera.  KSP is a litterer's dream.  There's so many places you can leave stuff you have no hope of bringing home.  And it's worth doing it just to see that stuff sitting there.\n\nBut I've got to warn you.  You've reached TL;DR level four, so here's a bonus.  This game has very unexpected side effects.  You will learn things.  Hoffman transfer.  Periapsis.  Apoapsis.  How orbit actually works.  Why orbit is halfway to anywhere.  Launch windows.  Free transfer windows.  Free returns.  If you make the horrifying inadvertent mistake of buying this game for yourself or your child, somebody's gonna learn things.  It's unavoidable.   Real things, even.  Newton's spectre haunts this game.  You will find no escape, and he fears no earthly garlic.\n\nLemmie wrap this up for the TL;DR folks who check the bottom summary.  Just get KSP already.  You aren't really learning anything from my review you probably didn't know already.  Let's be honest with each other, here.  Ok?  You don't want to learn whether or not this game is worth buying.  You're looking for someone to make the excuse for you.  You're already gonna get it, you just want someone to possibly take the fall for you if you catch heat for doing it.  And to you, good sirs and madams, I say;  Yes.  Yes, I'll take the blame.  "That fat idiot Whackjob from KSP told me to get the game, or he said he'd cut me."  They'll believe you.  You're good.  So do it.  Hit that buy button.\n\nThank me later.\n\n~Whackjob of KSP[i.imgur.com]","October 10, 2014","true","692.9"," 229 of 233 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","229","233","0","6"

Either you throw everything together and make things up as you go, or you spend equally as much time planning for a mission as actually flying it.  Either way, mission success (whatever you define that to be) is always either painstakingly earned or astronomically lucky (pun intended).  It's very hard to compare to the feeling of seeing a safe splashdown after one of your Kerbals (the characters that man spacecraft) has walked on the surface of another celestial body.  It's also hard to compare to the humbling feeling you get when you've made it halfway across the Kerbol system after significant planning and execution time only to realize that you left your landing legs at home.\n\nThis game will frustrate and exhilarate you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wardogone/recommended/220200/","wardogone","Wyvern001","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wardogone/","12 products in account","I promised myself that I would write a review of this game as soon as I passed 100 hours, so here goes nothing.\n\nThe best space game on Steam. Period.\nMy first launch in Kerbal Space Program, or KSP as it is more commonly known, was a mess. It consisted of a one-man command pod, a solid rocket booster, and a parachute. When I hit the Space button (pun intended), everything set off at once; the solid rocket booster ignited at the same time as the parachute deployed. This resulted in poor Jebediah and his pod crashing into the KSC. Oh well.\n\nNow, a hundred hours into the game, I have expanded my space exploration. A standard, fully functional manned orbiter is ready for launch anytime I want to play George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, minus the debris. Three geographical satellites are orbiting the Mun. And my biggest achievement? A small, scientific probe on the surface of Eve (the game's Venus equivalent), defying the extreme pressure and insane temperature to conduct scientific instruments. Eve Base 1 reads 400 degrees Celsius. Eve Base 1 does not care.\n\nThis is perhaps the best part of Kerbal Space Program. You learn throughout the game. Your tenth rocket will be far more advanced than your first one. Your Duna rover will be far more impressive than the small probe you landed (crashed) into Minmus. This game allows you to learn from your mistakes in an amazing way which is hard to describe. If something goes wrong, you figure out the problem. You try a new version of your spacecraft. It has a new problem, which you solve. And another problem. But eventually, your rocket is excellent, and to quote Ridley Scott's film adaption of The Martian: Solve enough problems and you get to go home. This game encourages and inspires you to fix your problems, and it does so in a way that is praiseworthy.\n\nIt's incredibly fun, too. Watching a rocket tilt and explode seconds after launch and seeing Jebediah's extatic face as his command pod falls towards the ocean at 100 m/s is enjoyable, in a slightly sadistic way. Watching a rocket achieve orbit and deploy its payload is fantastic. The same can be said for a close Moho flyby, or a successful landing on the Mun. When you achieve success in this game, there's a feeling which runs through you which can only be called a victorious feeling.\n\nMoving on to other things, I guess it's time to mention the diversity. This game has an extraordinary variation in pretty much everything. We'll start off with parts. You have a massive selection of everything from batteries to 81-ton fuel tanks. You can use these parts to create anything you want. Rockets. Space stations. Satellites. Giant vibrators. Nothing will stand in your way. Well, except physics.\n\nContinuing with diversity: Planets and moons. Despite limiting the player to a fictional solar system, this game does space exploration better than any game i've seen, and the planets and moons are perhaps the most important parts of this. None of the planets are actually planet-sized; they are many, many times smaller than their real-world counterparts. However, they are still large enough to make exploration extremely, and I mean extremely, interesting. Okay, I won't lie. Some parts are a bit boring. The Mun is grey and dull, as is Minmus. And you must be a truly boring person to find any interest in exploring the Dunian moon of Ike. But on the other hand: The thick atmosphere and the massive lakes of Eve makes any mission there worth it, the surface of Duna provides many interesting experiences, and going to the Joolian moon of Laythe just to watch the gas giant of Jool rise in the horizon is most definitely worth it. The game has fourteen explorable planets and moons, and you can spend literal days exploring one. Speaking of exploring, you can do this in any way you want - rovers, probes, manned landers, spaceplanes, essentially everything modern space travel has to offer.\n\nAnd then there's the physics. Many space games, enjoyable as they may be, does not give realistic physics. And while this can be pleasing, it also removes a layer of enjoyable difficulty. But while many games fail at space physics, Kerbal Space Program absolutely nails it. The physics are so good that Elon Musk - you know, the guy behind SpaceX and Tesla - as well as NASA engineers have praised this game. You can do real-world orbital maneuvers, transfers, prograde burns and basically everything NASA loves doing. Never have I found physics to be this enjoyable.\n\nThe graphics are interesting. The rockets and spaceships look beautiful, as does the thrusters. The blue flame of a KS-25 "Vector" booster is immensely beautiful. On a larger scale, it's a bit more complicated. Most planets look very nice from a distance, and acceptable on the surface, but when you're in a low orbit around Kerbin you can't help but notice how plain it looks. It's not bad, but it is dissappointing in a way. Of course, there are mods that can fix this, and I will come back to that soon. And every thought of the graphics being bad dissappears the moment you see that sunrise.\n\nNow that we're on the bad stuff, I guess there are a few things. Most notably, a mysterious crash boots me out of the game every five hours or so. And some warp mechanics are a bit dodgy. Same can be said for certain UI glitches. Anything else? Thinking...thinking...not really.\n\nSo, back to the good stuff, which KSP seems to be a never-ending source of. I shall conclude this review with mods. Oh, the mods. Many games does modding very well; i've had X-wings in Skyrim and Mass Effect battles in SW BF:II. But Kerbal Space Program has one of the best modding communities i've seen. To start off, we got basic fan-made part packs which covers some of the parts the game should have, but lacks. Then there's entire hangar packs which gives you a whole new way of sending Jebediah into space on questionable rocket designs. In addition to the parts, you got mods which adds whole new layers of gameplay; orbital scans, autopilots, upgraded base systems - just to name a few. One of my mods add amazing atmospheres to Kerbin, Eve, Duna, Jool and Laythe (there's something creepy but awesome about Eve's thick, Venus-like atmosphere). Another mod adds orbital scanners which allows me to map entire planets for future missions. Another mod gives me cameras which can be used for rocket launches and satellites alike. I got a mod which adds Soyuz (or "Soy-Juice", as the mod description says) pods, a mod which adds extra SRBs for extra explosions, and a mod which gives me a bigger and better atomic engine for those interplanetary missions. And so on.\n\nI think i'll conclude here. So, the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n- Amazing variety\n- Perfectly executed "learn from your mistakes" gameplay\n- Beautiful physics engine\n- An unmatched modding community\n\nCons\n- A small amount of annoying bugs\n- Graphics could be slightly better\n\nFinal score: 9.8/10\nThis game offers space exploration as never seen in a spacey wacey game before, at least not to my knowledge. If you have even the slightest interest in physics, space travel or astronomy, buy this game. Just do it.","February 3","true","372.4"," 190 of 195 people (97%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","97","190","195","28","7"

Very easy to get into, very hard to master.\n\nIt is not a simulation by any means, but that doesn't mean you won't still learn a lot about rocketry, and the things which NASA and the folks who fly in those crazy contraptions have to deal with.\n\nThe Community as well is extremely nice, and extremely active. With a mass amount of mods for the game, which allows you to really customize it to your liking (Much like Elder Scrolls games are).\n\nOn top of that, they are also moving it to  Unity 5 (If they havn't already at the time you're reading this in the future), meaning the limitation on mods will be quite literally... limitless.\n\nThat with Multiplayer to boot! (Coming Soon as well with Unity 5).\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThe game itself has 3 modes.\n\nCareer: Which pits you against your mind. Balancing income from successfull missions, reputation, and science. Failed missions could cost you big, and  learning how to create a more cost friendly ship to do the same job could save you bundles. Use Science to unlock new parts on the tech tree, to push your exploration even farther.\n\nScience: Same as Career but without the reputation and Money.\n\nSandbox: Like all Sandboxes..

One of those games I keep going back to (300+ hours as I write this).\n\nBeing a simulation, the number of situations you can find yourself in is nearly endless.\n\nMy most recent Kerbtastrophe occurred when my unmanned mapping and science probe (JoolStar1) was about to arrive at Jool after nearly 4 years in flight. Actually, it happened quite a while before that, I just wasn't aware of it.\n\nI switched to the probe, ready to fine-tune my approach so I could cut through the atmosphere, bleeding off speed without wasting fuel.\n\nSomething was wrong. The probe didn't respond to inputs. That's when I realised I hadn't deployed the solar panels before leaving Kerbin orbit!\n\nCursing, I tried to deploy them. Nothing. I mashed the button repeatedly. Still nothing. I checked the batteries... Empty!\n\nSince I didn't have a kerbal on board to do an EVA, there was nothing I could do except watch helplessly as JoolStar1 sailed straight past its destination, a failure destined to orbit the sun forever.\n\nThis game is all about failing repeatedly (and hilariously) until a Darwinian process of attrition results in an understanding of how to build, fly and land rockets.\n\nI can't recommend it highly enough","May 1, 2015","true","559.8"," 147 of 151 people (97%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","97","147","151","37","2"

(Try the free demo if you're unsure!)\n\nAn absolutely brilliant example of an open game still under development, KSP lets players explore the Kerbol system with a fleet of (mostly) operational, self-designed ships, probes, rovers, stations, permanent bases and, of course, manned missions. Although the Unity engine causes even top-end PCs to sometimes run at sub-par framerates, the game is slowly becoming more intricate and beautiful with every update. You'll quickly realise that there are no predefined goals and a lot of what you achieve on KSP is fuelled by your imagination, so if you're looking for a linear game with missions and a set storyline, this isn't for you.\n\nThe game features two different modes; career mode and sandbox mode. While the (basic) career mode is currently being updated and improved, sandbox definitely contains enough content to give dozens of hours of fun, if not more! Multiplayer is due to be introduced before final release too.\n\nOutside the stock game, the community is excellent with a plethora of mods created to complement the game, easily installed thanks to developer support and an official mod-sharing website. Once you begin to look for objectives beyond scooting around the rocky surface of Moho or exploring Jool's many moons, you can introduce extraplanetary mining with the Kethane mod, orbital mapping with the ISA MapSat mod, or a host of other content packages created by the community. Just expect to crash often when you first start, and don't grow too attached to any of your impressive creations. This is an alpha-level game, after all.","July 14, 2013","true","695.7"," 186 of 202 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","186","202","0","0"

What other game can boast of accurate portrayal of orbital physics, staging rocket sequences and interplanetary travel?  Gravity is a difficult beast to tame!\n\nYou're drawn in by the relatively simple ship construction aspect where you put together your ship like building blocks, attaching parts one at a time with options to make certain parts attach symmetrically.  Once you're on the launchpad though, ♥♥♥♥ gets real.  You will fail a lot, with your rocket exploding, or tipping over, or messing up the sequence of stages.\n\nJust leaving the atmosphere and establishing an orbit is a massive challenge, and that is still the early game!  Sending probes and landers to other planets and moons, building space stations and exploring the far reaches of the fictional solar system; these are all possible.  Beyond that, the Career and Science modes provide new tasks and objectives such as completing contracts or carrying equipment to perform various scientific experiments, and further still the Sandbox mode allows you to set your own goals.\n\nUnless you're a genius or have a huge deal of patience you will need to refer to various tutorials, wikis, guides and discussions online.  If physics scares you off you will probably find it hard to enjoy the game beyond its initial simple tasks.  You'll need to be willing to learn new things to get the most out of this game.\n\nKSP will likely give you a new appreciation of the space program of the 20th Century and what was achieved with the technology available at the time.

In KSP you design and build your very own spacecraft/rockets and spaceplanes which you then use as you leave Kerbin to further the scientific knowledge of the humble kerbal. With a vast array of parts at your disposable it's daunting at first, well it's daunting for a while, but once you get the hang of it this game is a blast, especially if you have any interest in astrophysics or aerospace engineering.\n\nKSP has four different game modes each of which I will give a brief description of.\n\nFirst off there's sandbox mode. In sandbox mode you have no limitations and most importantly you have access to all of the parts right away, this is the perfect way for new players to get to grips with building and figuring out what works well and how the game works.\n\nNext we have scientific mode. In scientific mode you have to generate science points from doing experiments in different places, e.g. the surface of Kerbin or low Kerbin orbit. Science points you earn can then be spent on new technologies in the tech tree which unlock new parts which help you to go to new places to complete more experiments. You begin with few parts which are basic so unlocking new technologies in imperative to progress.\n\nUp next is career mode. Career mode is scientific mode but now with money and reputation to worry about. Money is earned by completing contracts, such as putting a part on your rocket and getting it to a certain altitude and then money is spent on parts for your rocket or spaceplane. Reputation is earned by successfully completing contracts, the higher your reputation is the better the contracts you get offered are.

KSP is a game first, and a simulation second. You don't have to be Scott Manley, or even average, at the game in order to have fun. Just build stuff and fly it about! You'll learn the nuances of spaceflight as you go. Not to mention if flight and orbital mechanics elude you, there are mods such as MechJeb that assist you with flying your ship and going from one planet to another, or perform the maneuvers FOR you, that way you can focus on building and watching things go boom. The more recent addition of "Career" mode takes the new player experience even further, serving as a guided, but still sandboxy, introduction to all aspects of the gameplay.\n\nReasons to buy KSP:\nYou like space.\nYou like explosions.\nYou like sandbox games.\nYou have a soul.\nReasons not to buy KSP:\nYou mistakenly think space isn't awesome.\nExplosions scare you.\nYou're afraid you'll get sand in your eyes.\nYou have no soul.","October 28, 2014","true","687.1"," 113 of 119 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","113","119","0","3"

My Kerbal Space Program story originated over 2 years ago when a friend suggested it and I quickly shrugged it off. I started watching videos, downloaded the demo, got hooked and here I am with over 960 hours and still going in this game. I never run out of things to do. Yes there is a huge learning curve but it is totally worth it. Even with the amount of time I have dedicated to this game I still cannot perfectly perform maneuvers, but what would be the fun in that? The modding community is great, as is the community in general. I have never seen a community so dedicated to ehlping others as the Kerbal community is.

You will build your own vessels, choose your targets for exploration, colonization, scientific endeavor, etc, and blast off for space. The construction system is incredibly robust and fun to use, and, because of the level of customization available, tends to mean that no two ships will ever look or behave exactly alike. There are no food or oxygen or water needs on ships (several mods change this if you want), but the actual mechanics and physics of the game are convincingly accurate, and make for a, while unforgiving, very fun game, because the feedback is extremely consistent. A mistake will kill you EVERY time, unless something hilarious happens (this is actually one of the great parts of playing KSP).\n\nI cannot say enough positive things about this game. I purchased this originally in April of 2013, before it was on steam, and only purchased it on steam now that it has officially released. KSP has few goals, and in sandbox mode, it has none, but  goals are not the reason to play KSP. The first time I successfully put a Kerbal in orbit around his home planet, I was dancing around my dorm room, and the first time I landed a Kerbal on the Mun, I felt a sense of accomplishment I have quite literally never felt in a game before. Now, over the course of what must be at least a thousand hours of play, I have built massive colonies on Laythe, the Mun, Minmus, Duna, Eve, and even Ike, I've built huge orbital stations around various planets, and I've even built floating cities in the clouds of Jool and Eve through the use of just a few of the thousands of mods available. I've built resource collection and transport systems including storage, mining, and transport operations. I've explored hundreds of different areas with probes, landers, and vehicles, and yet, to this day, I still play this game at least two to three hours a week, and I'll go on KSP binges several hours long when I think of a new challenge to set for myself. Currently, a friend of mine and I are in a little friendly competition for who can build the most epic Duna colonization project. If you can't tell by now, if you want an 'on rails' game where everything is spoonfed to you, just leave now. This game is most certainly NOT for you. The contract system is honestly only there to give a person inspiration.\n\nBut if you want a game that throws challenges at you that will test every brain cell you have, and pound your face into the ground mercilessly if you make even the slightest mistake, then KSP is your game. And when you finally put a Kerbal safely on the Mun, you just might understand why so many people write such glowing things about KSP.","May 3, 2015","true","322.8"," 99 of 105 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","99","105","10","5"

But from failures you will learn, to arise from the ashes and achieve more and more greater stuff. Soon you will be on your first suborbital-trajectory, have your first Kerbal astronaut in space and so on and so on; and yet you have no clue of the possibilities that await you. But with logic and lots of explosions (trial&error seems to be a leading motive at the Kerbal Space Center) you will always advance somehow.\n\nBe rewarded for your achievements: KSP does not have integrated achievements that tell you what virtual master piece of a task you just completed, and yet everything you accomplish feels more fulfilling than it ever felt before. You are behind the success or failure of whatever you do.\n\nA humorous touch: Very early in the game you will realize that those small green guys (that are somehow in the fashion of the minions of Despicable Me) you command are very keen to progress in their space program. They are also a little bit clumsy and as you can imagine the combination results in a lot of explosion, but Kerbals like nothing more than explosions and therefore failure will never feel devastating.\n\nA devouted developer: Squad, who is responsible for KSP, is working hard to improve their game contionously. What started years ago in an early alpha version of the game has developed contionously and even now, after the official release, there is a steady flow of updates, additions and fixes. Similar to Skyrim the game is easily moddable and has a tremendous amount of mods that are easily installable and often high-quality.\n\nCONs\n"We're gonna need a rescue mission"\n\nYou will lose: This game is definitely no game that guides you from A to Z like many other newer games do, and on your journey there will be loss of material - parts, rockets and Kerbals. But this is just part of the experience and the process of learning. The in-game tutorials offer you a sufficient start and if you further want to increase your knowledge and limits there is always the possibility to watch videos or read guides - both of those are out there in great quality!","June 30, 2015","true","123.0"," 88 of 92 people (96%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","96","88","92","36","2"

That is the general pattern of gamers this day in age, where developers make a game with hopes that the player will get a good 7-8 hours of fun, then leave it satisfied and thirsty for more.\n\nThen I heard about a game called Kerbal space program in 2012. I watched the trailers and a few gameplay vids, and thought that this looks interesting enough to try out, maybe I'll get a weeks worth of gameplay out of it... oh boy was I wrong.\n\nKSP is an example of how a videogame can change the way you see videogames forever. It is revolutionary, it is inspiring, and it is educational; and it doesn't even have an objective! The player is given an entire solar system to explore via the utilization of their very own space program.\n\nIt literally is 'Build, Fly , Dream.'\n\nNo videogame seems to have figured out that the best way to keep a person engaged is to provide them with their OWN goals and the tools to reach them. You start KSP with no instructions, only a small tutorial on how KSP basically works. Then the game lets you do whatever you want. So what do players do? They invent a new challenge for themselves, like to make it into orbit.\n\nSo the player keeps designing, building, testing and crashing, until they reach their goal. And OH BOY is it satisfying! You feel accomplished, like you've done something unique in your life and want to share it with the world. Then you see the Mun in the background and you say to yourself... "I wanna go there next!" So the player builds, tests, fails, retests etc until they get to their goal. This goes on for the rest of your gaming career in KSP.\n\nWanna build a space shuttle? Go ahead! Wanna build a car? Go ahead. Wanna build an elevator? Go ahead. Wanna build ANYTHING you want that actually WORKS via physics, this game lets you. It is the ultimate expression of engineering, creativity and the human spirit.\n\nI cannot sing this games praises enough. I picked it up in summer of 2012 and have played it EVERY. SINGLE. DAY since then. And if the stock game becomes too easy... why not try some of the communities mods? Everytime you download a new mod, you basically get a new game with more toys to build and design with.\n\nI don't need any other game other than this one. Thank you Squad for reinvigorating my hope in videogames!\n\n10/10 and it's not even finished yet!\n\nBravo!","February 27, 2015","true","714.3"," 72 of 75 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","72","75","7","3"

Kerbal Space Program is NOT simply a game about building rockets, launching them, and seeing where they go. Its tagline is "Conquering Space Was Never This Easy", and that is true, it is easy, compared to doing it in real life. But don't let it fool you- KSP actually has a pretty steep learning curve. In the month that I've had this game, I've only just gotten my first satellite into orbit of Kerbin (KSP's version of Earth). I haven't even gotten to a single moon or other planet. But don't let that deter you. Look up tutorials for the game (Side note- The in-game tutorials are actually pretty terrible. I recommend finding ones online, such as Scott Manley's, who does a great job of explaining how the game works). The sense of accomplishment you get when you do accomplish those tasks- even if it's just setting up a simple probe like I did- is phenomenal. And from what I've seen, once you do manage to master the game, you can do basically anything. Never give up.\n\nAll in all, Kerbal Space Program is not just a game.

I've been playing the early access game for over 2 years, but now that it became official I thought I'd write a review.  My review is very positive.   (But see the caveat about version 1.0 below at the bottom).\n\n(Full disclosure: I don't work for SQUAD but I do help write one of the mods for the game, so I am personally invested in this.)\n\nGet This Game.  For once a sci-fi game that is actual sci-fi and not science fantasy.  It doesn't insult the intelligence of the player, and it speculates what-if, in a relatively reasonable way, only breaking a few laws of physics here and there where needed for gameplay, rather than breaking ALL of them constantly like most space video games do.\n\nKerbal Space Program as history:\nAlthough the solar system in the game is artificially smaller than would realistically be possible (so it doesn't take as long to get things done as it really would), it still has all the parts and the right places to emulate historical real-world space programs.  Don't be fooled by the cute derpy-looking Kerbals - you can use the game to see what it would be like to emulate historical actual space missions - space stations in low orbit, docking maneuvers, performing an Apollo-style "Mun" landing, send rover probes to "Duna" (which is Mars-like), and so on.  All from gluing together parts and having fun.\n\n(And if you really want to go all-out, there are user community mods out there that replace the game's solar system with the real thing, so you can really try these missions out in full size).\n\nKerbal Space Program as a 'tycoon' style game:\n\nIf you like the old style 'tycoon' games where you have to come up with a means of keeping your business afloat and research new technologies to do interesting things as you move on to bigger and more ambitious projects, then Kerbal Space Program Career Mode is for you.  Start up a new game, pick "career mode", set Normal or Easy difficulty (do NOT use Hard until you've played a while), and you'll have the fun of trying to balance funding (for making better space center buildings, and for making the rockets themselves), reputation (for making future offers you see be better for you), and science points (for buying your way up the tech tree).  Accept contracts, and try to fufill them cheaply so your space agency makes money from them to fund the other stuff you want to do.   Don't fail them or else you'll lose funds and rep for it.\n\nKerbal Space Program as a mod platform:\n\nFrom it's early access days, a user community of modders has grown, such that you can do just about anything you can think of with the game.  As of this writing, because KSP 1.0.2 is relatively new, some of those mods won't work just yet, but they will after only a week or two.  If past use is anything to go by that's about how long it takes for the modders to catch up to a new release.  As Steam is not the only means of obtaining the game, and not even the first means of obtaining it, the company, SQUAD, has chosen not to support Steam Workshop for mods due to the way it would open up the chance for people to make Steam-only mods that would be unfair to those who bought the game in its early days and supported the company before the game was even on Steam.  I support this decision, but it does mean you'll have to take a few extra steps to find the mods and install them.  Look up "KSP" on curse.com and look for Kerbalstuff.com.  most mods are in both places.\n\nKerbal Space Program as "edutainment":\n\nThe game is quite educational, but in that good sneaky fun way, where you don't realize you're learning - you're just trying to get stuff done in the game and in so doing learning stuff along the way.  If you've got a teenager or pre-teen at home, give this to them.  It does something that is really hard to do - it *demonstrates* though gameplay how a mathematical concept works, visually, without revealing the actual formulas, in such a way that the hard math can come *after* the intuitive understanding.  Usually what makes math hard is that the understanding and 'feel' can't happen until *after* you understand the numbers.  But here, it lets you play with the phenomenon first, and understand it later after its behavior has becomine intuitive to you, rather than the other way around.\n\nGet. This. Game.\n\nA caveat:\n\nMy review refers to the 1.0.2 version of KSP and emphatically NOT to the 1.0 initial release that came out a week before and had a critical re-entry bug.  Had I written the review about the 1.0 version, it would not have been as kind.  The 1.0 release was rushed by about a week.  The 1.0.2 release from a week later was MUCH better, and is probably what should have been the 1.0 release.\n\nR.E. The KSP 1.0 re-entry bug:  You may read reviews by people complaining about re-entry being broken when 1.0 game out.  Those reviews weren't wrong *at the time* they were written.  KSP 1.0 was rushed out with a re-entry bug that was very unfair, and importantly, really obvious so it's hard to imagine how they missed it.  Adding a heat shield actually *caused* the ship to blow up on re-entry because adding it made the vessel flip nose-first, rendering the heat shield worse than useless as a part.  If you see reviews complaining about this behavior, be aware that they are stale and referring to an old version.\n\n","May 4, 2015","true","780.4"," 68 of 70 people (97%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","97","68","70","8","0"

Besides, if someone wants that Buzz Aldrin's Space Race is available for sale on Steam.\n\nInstead, you get better at the game. You develop an understanding of Newtonian Physics - more than you ever thought you would. You build massive rockets and undertake interesting expeditions. You'll grin the first time you get a rocket into orbit. You'll pump your fist when you land on the Mun for the first time. And you'll continue having fun.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?

Eventually, though I managed to get a ship to 10.000 meters up in the air before it fell back on the ground, killing everyone within. ''That'', I thought, ''was the greatest thing I have ever done.''\nFast forward a week or two later, and I have already mastered orbiting, have landed on the Mun, Duna and Eve and am ready to set up my first refueling space stacion and send a rover to Duna.\nThis game pumps more adrenaline into my veins than any FPS out there, and is probably the most rewarding game I have ever played. Landing your first ship will make you jump, I promise you that.\nThe only downside is that there are some fairly annoying glitches, for example, warping time in atmosphere ♥♥♥♥s your ship up badly, but they don't appear all that often.\nDefinetly a must buy.","January 31, 2015","true","113.7"," 58 of 61 people (95%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","95","58","61","17","2"

When your rockets or planes blow up, the Kerbals seem to laugh gleefully with you. 'You'll need more rockets on that' is the implication. When you look for answers though, you will be learning about your Apoapsis, your delta v, your due east prograde orbit, oh and about mystery goo. You will be learning Astrophysics and Rocket Science, and applying it to solve problems.\nIncredible.\n\nKSP is the premier example of  a Steam Greenlight success. The devs have cultivated a vibrant modding community. Chuckled when in order to make a mod work with the game I simply altered the version number in a text file from 1.02 to 1.04.  Wherner von Kerman would have been proud.\n\nMy journey with this game has only begun, but I can relate the pleasing sense of accomplishment upon closing off my first orbit of Kerbin. Next step the Mun!\n\nI must admit  to having to double check some of the instructions despite my obviously above average intelligence.

I bought the game in what was called early access beta, but it was already pretty polished. I think that was in versions .6 or so?\n\nI became OK and landed on Mun and Minimus several times. Many, many times, actually, and maxed out science just by going to Mun and Minimus and getting every biome.\n\nBut, then I set the game aside. I didn't want to be burned out on it before it actually left Beta. I recently returned and almost ragequit. Many things have changed. Everything I thought I knew, I had either forgotten or didn't work anymore.\n\nI have played it a lot the last few days. I have had a lot of successes and a lot of failures, but I am essentially back to where I was before I quit. The learning curve is pretty steep. Do you want to just fly out of the atmosphere? Fairly easy to figure out. Do you want to fly to one of the moons, land, and then take off with the expectation of getting back to Kerbin (Kerbal's Earth)? It's going to take a lot more knowledge.\n\nI do recommend this game, but I have to agree with someone else. Unless you're an engineer by nature, you're probably going to need help at some point, because this game is not a child's game. It is tough, but rewarding.\n\nI try not to look at too much on youtube because I don't want to spoil it for myself, but I am to the point that it is going to take a drastic rethinking of what I'm doing, or I am going to need to watch tutorials to get anywhere out of Kerbin's orbit and get back safely. I sent an unmanned probe to Duna (basically Kerbin's Mars). I was not able to bring it back. Thankfully, no Kerbals were killed on that adventure.\n\nYes, I'd say get this game. If you see it on sale, then grab it immediately. I guess I have put 170 hours in to it. I'll probably put thousands into it before it is all over.","May 24, 2015","true","714.3"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","44","48","5","0"

There is a whole solar system for you to discover, planets to land on (and attempt a return from) in the stock game, and with a large and active modding base, the combinations for rocket types and adventures are endless. The game also gives you a far better appreciation of the difficulties, challenges and indeed triumphs of actual space programs, past and present. From various types of custom built rockets, space planes, space stations, and installations on other worlds that can be constructed, Kerbal reminds us how good games can be, and is a game that will definitely not leave you disappointed and keep you coming back for more and more, as the amount of sleep you get dwindles.","July 20, 2013","true","716.2"," 34 of 34 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","34","34","0","0"

I know, sounds corny I'm sure but this app and it's game play takes me back to my youth where Astronomy and Space were most of what I could dream, think and talk about.\n\nRoll ahead a few decades and this game gives me such a sense of freedom, accomplishment and challenge.  Sure it's geeky, nerd stuff but honestly what isn't these days?  Madden 2015? Sure, geeks playing pixels of sports greats they can never be like so I guess it's not far off. (lol)\n\nThis 'game' as they call it will teach you things about the science, mathematics and common sense problem solving that could help you in your life.  I'm sure by this point you're saying 'But how will an orbit trajectory to Mun help me..?' and 'How is knowing the dV to escape the SOI of Kerbal going to help me..?' and you for one would be right.  These, while still teaching the literal effect in game, also teaches you about solving sometimes complex puzzles or math problems or those 'how could I even do that?' types of questions.  From the first launch, which in itself is not 'easy' by any stretch of the imagination; to the 100th, 200th and several thousandth launch later you want to do more and push further into space.  It's those types of feelings that mold and lead those younger generations to wanting and wishing they knew and could do more.\n\nMuch like an aging dreamer, who at his younger years had always dreamt of getting the chance to leave this floating rock we call home.\n\nGame is great.  You just have to dream a little more, want a little more and do a little more.\n\nTL:DR - Game is stupendous and anyone interested in space, space flight and rocketry with a keen sense of having fun all the while doing math, physics and all that wonderful science stuff without really knowing you are/can/will.\n\n~Icky","February 4, 2015","true","103.5"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","44","50","7","0"

At that time, I knew 'of' the equations and methods used to get things into space, albeit not grasping the details to any extent. They were not familiar, but also not foreign. I opened KSP, and joyfully set to building what I thought would be a simple, but effective rocket. Ecstatic when completed, I excitedly smashed the button to launch. The view of my creation on the launchpad gave me chills. With shaking hands, heart racing, I gently pushed the space bar. The rocket ignites with a powerful firestorm. For a fleeting moment, my eyes found Jeb in the bottom corner of the screen. He was terrified. Panicing, I center my eyes on the screen, fingers ready to steer my way to space and victory. Six seconds into flight, the rockets begins to rip apart, parachute deployed and pulled taught from force of the rocket's climb. Rocket parts scatter in the aftermath of an explosion. I look to Jeb, preparing myself to see his corpse, mutilated and burned. On inspection, I see he survived. The look of panic on his face has become horror. The rocket's capsule is tumbling end over end, climbing in altitude. Muscles in my arms spasm as my person slips into shock, my mind reaching for help, begging for training and emergency reaction to kick in. Floundering, tears in my eyes, I desperately begin to smash buttons on the keyboard. My head is locked on the screen, eyes vigorously searching for a button to fix everything, to save Jeb from his certain doom. My heart sinks as seconds pass and nothing seems help, all of my fingers are finding buttons and pressing. The capsule apexed and started its decent, tethered to Kerbin by gravity's unrelenting pull. I lock up, panting short breaths, staring at the screen. I cannot blink. I cannot look away. The capsule strikes the ground.\n\nA dialog appears on the screen, confirming Jebidiah's death.\n\nI have since killed many more kerbals, slowly learning the ropes. I understand more about rocket science than I ever expected. I have had successful missions to the Mun, Minmus, Duna, and Jool.\n\nIf you are brand new to this game, the best advice I have is to NOT turn the 'snap-to' feature on when building things in the VAB, and start killing kerbals. You will be amazed at what you learn.","April 30, 2015","true","208.1"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","93","38","41","19","0"

Seriously, it's really, really awesome. And it teaches you physics. So you pass your exams. Win-win.\n\nI feel like listing the pros and cons. Because that's what everyone else does. And it gives you a better idea of the game.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Physics: Explosive stuff explodes, stuff that looks like a plane flies (mostly), spaceships fly like spaceships, stuff that looks like a rover WILL flip over.\n- Visuals: The graphics are not as good as some games, but they are definitely good enough. I particularly like all the small details, like the way the RAPIER engine puffs before going out, or the cockpit details, or the little ridges on the engines, or the way the landing gear closes up.\n- Career Mode: Feels like you're really running a space agency, and you really feel worried when you crash a rocket into a building and don't have enough money to rebuild it.\n- Sandbox Mode: It's also nice to be able to say, "Stuff it, I can't afford this, nor can I wait long enough to invent really powerful rocket engines! Give me everything for free!"\n- The way spacecraft just feel like they 'work': The difference between the different engine sizes, the weight distribution problems, the new aerodynamics model, everything theoretically 'works'. My spaceships don't actually work. They explode.\n- The difficulty: This game is hard. Very hard. But only if you make it so. If you stick to low-altitude flights and don't try to go to Jool straight away, this game is very possible to play. And slowly, very slowly, you'll get better, and be able to get to Jool.\n- Small green beings: Kerbals themselves are very cute. I want one. Anyone know where to buy a Kerbal Plushy?\n- Mods: When 1.0 was released, I deleted all my mods and started afresh, so I don't know if they still work. But in Beta, I was greatly enhancing my experience with mods like BDArmoury, B9 Aerospace, KW Rocketry, Chatterer (A completely useless but nonetheless fantastic mod) and Infernal Robotics.\n-Performance: This game doesn't need a supercomputer to run. I can run it fine on a six-year-old MacBook Pro, no problems. I do have the occasional lagspike when a lot is happening at once, and the framerate tops out at around 35 FPS on a good day, but it certainly ain't unplayable.\n\nCons:\n\n- Difficulty: Yeah. I know. That was a Pro as well. But as I said earlier, some things are very hard. Like getting to Jool.\n- Lack of an autopilot: The game could do with someone who could fly. Because for a long time, you won't be that someone.\n- The load times: This game has a lot to load in, and it takes a long time.\n- Lack of stuff: This game has a lot of stuff, but could do with more.\n- Problems with adding stuff to wings: Elevons, Landing Gear, and engines are really hard to fix on properly.\n- Lack of smaller pre-built wings.\n\nSo in conclusion, this game awesome. Really, really awesome. Totally fantastic. I love it.\n\nThanks for reading!","May 14, 2015","true","93.7"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","39","43","8","0"

Turns out i slacked off too much at school. Ah well. But i always had an interest in space, and particularly exploring it.\nThis game gave me a sandbox to play in where i could design spacecraft and send little green men up into space above the blue earth... erm, i mean Kerbin.\nYou know its always the little green men trying to visit earth in the movies. In this they cant get away quick enough.\n\nYou know this game has something for everyone. Even if you do not have any real inclination to do anything so involved as perfect orbits, or landing perfectly on the moon (Mun) or whatever this game still gives you the chance to make crazy rockets that you can set off and see how far they get before it, and its possible inhabitants die a horrible, horrible death.\nAnd for those, like me who have a more involved interest in the subject matter, there is plenty that will satisfy you.\n\nThink you can do it better than NASA?

(Go to launch... topple over and go boom... darn it, try again...)\nThe graphics are pretty good. Some reason the crew is hard on my system when building the crafts, had to turn them off.\n\nOne thing I do not understand is why your craft is desroyed even when hitting water at 5m/s via parachute, only thing to survive is the cockpits. (not a game breaker, just know the water is off limites in the game)\n\n... Patience is required while playing ...\nIt takes a long time to get across the oceans to land your craft at desired locations. You have to be careful when using the speed up if flying a plane. It can cause you to loose/gain altitude without touching the controls.\n\nThe arodynamics of the game are increadable. Durring one of my missions, altidude required for testing an item had put me in space, I managed to test it, but was out of fuel, and still orbiting, I almost restarted but chose to see if the close path was close enough to barely skim the atmosphere, and sure enough, angled the heat sheild to push the module deeper into the atmosphere, reducing orbit considerably, the next pass was slow enough to actually stay in the atmosphere, again, angled it to push it in deeper. The angle was so good, I was able to open the chutes at about 1900m and land on top of a mountain.\n\nNeucances of the game, the physics engine does something strange, causing the ship to stop flowing with the rest of the system, the ship dangles there, it's orbit doesn't move, but the planet does, if left alone long enough, the orbit no longer orbits the planet, but the ship still hangs there. Other times the ship suddenly disintigrates right after a "warp time" menuver. More than one occation on a load, the vessel is well belloe the 0m mark, on water it breaks the ship into pieces, and only specific pieces float to the surface. On land, only the pieces that register as above 0.000m is not instantly destroyed. These sorts of things make it difficult to play career mode. Occational crash to desktop, without known reasons, sometimes it says it has crashed, and to tell them about it, yet doesn't say what to do with a folder. I got the game through steam, will be nice when they have an update to fix known bugs. (Even so, I still recomend the game.)\n\n.... Bottom Line ... I am enjoying the game. Devs keep up the great work.","August 15, 2015","true","704.0"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","29","30","6","2"

Oh, this game. I had a review that i posted back in October 2014 that i deleted in order to post this one for more accuracy. The game reached full release yesterday, so i deleted my Early Access review for the sake of accuracy when i posted this one.\n\nFirst of all, i want to make this absolutely clear that this game is not easy. I put this here due to a thread i saw a day ago of a man demanding his £30 back because the game was too hard, and he had no interest in "3d oval orbits, etc." While this was a gross lack of research on his part, and mostly his fault, i still thought i'd put this here. Especially with the new aerodynamics model, this game is the closest thing we have to an accurate spaceflight simulator.\n\nThis game is about launching small, disproportionate green men into space.\n...In theory. That's how it works if you're good at the game. (Like me! (humblebrag))\nIf you're bad at the game, like most newbies, it ends up being more like launching small, disproportionate green men a few thousand metres into the air, then atmospheric drag pulls you back to the ground and kills said disproportionate green men. Unless you believe they're plants, like i do, then they just probably regrow somewhere.\n\nYour first step will be learning to orbit, then going to the Mun, then Minmus, then basically wherever you please. The game allows you to construct rockets or planes, then fly them. There's tens of parts to choose from, and lots to do in the game, if you have a bit of patience. The game has numerous tutorials and scenarios to help you out with the basics.\n\nI don't want this review to drag too long, since everything i would tell you here is better explained by people like Scott Manley. (Check out his channel on YouTube if you're interested in this game! He has a few tutorials there, also.)\n\nTL;DR this game is great and if you have an interest in space you should get it. Wait for a sale if you don't want to shell out £30 on it. Also do not forget the fact the game has a demo that you should most certainly get if you're interested in the game. Last i checked the demo is WAY outdated, though, so don't see it as a complete representation of the game.\n\nUPDATE: I should stress that you need persistence. If you fail, try and try again.

With the latest, .23, we see some massive load time improvements, far less lag with high-part-count vehicles, tweakables *in the ship editor* and best of all, only one of my mods had issues, but it didn't crash the game - it simply didn't function at "go time".  That's already been fixed, it just hadn't been released officially as of this time yesterday.\n\nIf you like space ship games, you will want this game - it's pretty damned hard if you're coming in with zero experience with rocketry, calculus and / or orbital mechanics.  You'll walk away with some if you put in the effort in career mode in this game.  I have a far better understanding of how something gets into orbit - and far more respect for the men and women who engineer those feats.\n\nIf you like educational games, this one is for you as well - it's not for all kids, but I could see a bright middle school or high school student picking this up quicker than most adults.  And adults could all learn a thing or two by playing this game - NASA engineers play this game in their free time.\n\nAnd most importantly, if you like to tinker AND play video games, this game was quite likely made for you.  The mod system is incredibly simple to work with - but if you know the right languages, you can make whole new features in the game!\n\nAt any price, $10 or $60, this is a game worth every penny - and it's not even done yet!\n\nUPDATE for Beta 0.90:\n\nSince this review was written, Career mode has been added, the old Career mode renamed to "Science".  In addition, further features have been added - Contracts, better joints, new parts, way easier navigation and the career mode actually feels like you're helping the Kerbals march their way to the planets!  You have to balance science with your contracts (money!) and grow things carefully.\n\nIt truly is educational in every sense - engaging, teaching and adjusting.  This game is whatever you want it to be - the mod ecosystem is growing and with CKAN, it's even easier to install and remove mods with a push of a button.

I mean : it is about ACTUAL space travel, how awesome is that?\n\nI'll recommend it, but there is one thing I can not stress enough : IT IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY.\n\nThere are basically two ways to play that game : either you build crazy rockets in sandbox mode and you see if your random construction somehow achieves orbit OR you actually try to become a good (in-game) rocket scientist and launch a planned payload to a specific destination in the solar system.\n\nAnd to become such a rocket scientist  you will either need :\nCollege level math and physics, as well as a huge excel spreadsheet\nTo read and follow tutorials, and have a huge patience with trial and error\nAnd... that's not exactly the conception of "fun" or a "game" to many people.\n\nJust to give an idea of why you need the "school stuff" : this game expects you to know what newtons are. (And no, those are not clones of a guy who took an apple on the head XD) It expects you to count speeds in m/s rather than km/h (just as a scientist does). You must also understand the concept of relative vector speed in a 3D environment... and many other things.\n\nThe game features tutorials fortunately, but they only give the basics and you'll still have to learn most of the game by yourself.\n\nAnd even though the game simplifies a few aspects from reality (like for instance oxygen and astronaut's mental state management), on what it actually simulates it is ruthless : no fuel left after a 3 hour mission (for you, in the game, years have passed)? You miss your entry into the gravity field of a planet? You didn't launch your interplanetary mission on a correct date? Well, enjoy your newborn space debris! No way out of that except loading a past save. And this feature is not available on the hardest difficulty by the way.\n\nYou might say : if you run out of fuel, it's because you messed up and you're bad, so it's normal to be punished.\n\nTrue.\nBut this is why you pretty much need the math and the scientific expertise : to actually calculate if you have enough fuel BEFORE the mission, while taking into account a margin of error as well (because your manual-piloting manoeuvers will never be perfect).\nIf you're fine with it, following a tutorial will allow you to build the spaceship suited to your mission and not worry about that. But I also believe it is kinda missing the point of the game.\n\nHowever, this scientific grounding and this high difficulty also come with a good side.\nWhich is : when your plan unfolds as planned and you actually succeed, my God is it satisfying.\n\nI usually don't take screenshots of my games, but here when I actually managed my first moon landing, I just took so many. Because for once a game had made me feel proud. Yes, PROUD. And I have to say, it's the first time it has happened (at least to such a degree).\n\nThe Kerbal Space Programl WIKI is very well made can help a lot by providing you with already-simplified mathematic formulas, preventing you from having to demonstrate those yourself. It could help people less familiar with math and physics to achieve more with the game and actually feel proud as well.\nThe game also features lots of mods, and some are actually all about helping you to do all this calculus. It can replace the custom spreadsheet for those who do not wish to make one.\n\nIf you don't look at any wiki and don't use any mods, then the challenge is phenomenal, even for an actual scientist, as the game throws you out there with minimal data.\n\nYou might actually like a science and math challenge. If you think you do then buy this game. you won't regret it.\n\nIf science, math, and ruthless difficulty are not truly your thing, there is the option of playing this game as a "lego" game where you build crazy stuff and see if they work. You could actually learn a lot about science and astronomy while you do that, so it might be worth it.\nI know I wouldn't enjoy playing "randomly" like that and I can't recommend it. But who knows, maybe you don't mind.\n\nJust be aware of one thing : unless you do some science and math (or have it done for you, but is that the point?), you'll never land that miniature base on the distant moon of the planet Jool... But hey, maybe you are actually totally fine with that.","September 25, 2015","true","119.8"," 44 of 57 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","44","57","5","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/recommended/220200/","midnightwolfie","MidnightWolfie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/","597 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA bit about the game and developers.\nKerbal Space Program is a space travel simulation game developed and published by Squad. Kerbal Space Program is their only game for now, and even that one isn't out yet. All of the review and game footage that you will see in this review is from ALPHA! Things could change when ever Squad feels they want something new.\n\nAbout Gameplay.\nAs I said earlier, Kerbal Space Program is a simulation game. In it your objective is to build up a space craft and fly it into the space. You have a lot of different parts to chose from, with which you can create your space craft very unique! And It's very simple as well. All you need to do is Drag and Drop the part where you want it to be, and woala, you've got yourself a small aircraft. Of course, you do need to think about the laws of physics, and It will take you a couple of tries to even manage and get into the space! You need to think about how many engines should you take, how much fuel, how big should your ship be... And if it's too big, you should put it into couple of smaller pieces and just launch them into the space one by one.\n\nThat sounds very simple, doesn't it? Well I'm sorry to brake this down for you.. This game is insanely hard! Just imagine, you need to set up the space craft just perfectly! Then you need to set up the valid commands (what engines start first, then which ones fall to the ground while the new ones start, and so on and on), then you need to think about the gravity. You need to make your space craft go straight forward into the air until it reaches about 10 000 km. After that you should turn around 45 Degrees. By that time, you're almost out of the gravity's reach. But that is not all of it! Once you get your space craft out into the orbit, you will probably lose all of your fuel. So then you need to launch more fuel from the ground. Simple, right? Nope! By the time you get into the orbit, your other part of the space craft is already orbiting around the "Earth" (i forgot the name of the in game planet, I'm sorry!) so you either have to catch up with it, or make your fuel fly the other way around. Very hard, but fun!\n\nOnce you have finally put your ship fully together, you can travel to the Moon, Mars, or where ever you want! As long as you know what you're doing, and as long as you've got enough fuel left. Don't forget that you'd like to get your crew back, right? We need them to be heroes after all! And I think that the game wouldn't be so hard if it had a better tutorial. Tutorial teaches you how to fly a ship, and how to assemble it on the ground, but it doesn't teach you how to assemble it in space, it doesn't teach you how to land on the moon, nor anything else. That's the main reason why this game is hard. And I think that once the developers finish the tutorial properly, the game will be much more loved in the public! I, sadly, never managed to get out of the "Earth's" orbit and go to the moon. I managed to get half way there once, but that's it, hehe. It's just hard.\n\nGraphic and Audio\nGraphically speaking, the game looks great. This game is made by the Unity software, and it's amazing what Squad made this game look like. It has a lot of nice details, the land looks pretty decent, and the space looks amazing. Water, though, looks pretty bad. But once again, this game is just in alpha! The songs are pretty good too, but after too many hours, they get a bit annoying. Not so big problem though!\n\nPros, cons and final grade.\nPros:\n- Very fun building game.\n- Ability to make your ship look different from all the other ones.\n- Ability to travel around the space, and go on any planet in our solar system.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of tutorial.\n\nOverall grade: 8/10.\n\nTo explain my grade - It would be 9 if the game had better tutorial system. This game is extremely fun, but very hard to learn, so better tutorial would be very welcome. It would also be 10 if they put the Kerbal customization into the game, and if they added multiplayer into it! It could be very hard to do, but I'm sure it'd be awesome, hehe.\n\nExtra info:  I really loved Kerbal Space Program, and I will keep on watching the game progress. I will review it once again once it comes fully out, because I'm sure that this game will still have a lot to offer! I support Kerbal Space Program!\n\n\nThank you for reading my reviews! Don't forget that I'm usually posting new reviews on my blog weekly and you can check them out here:[/b] http://midnightwolfie.blogspot.com\nThank you![/b]","November 27, 2013","true","6.7"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","34","42","0","0"

There are two modes (state in the alpha), the career-mode where you have to complete some goals, research for better rocket parts and so on and you have the sandbox-mode where you have  all parts from the beginning and where you can set your own goals. An orbit around "Kerbin" (corresponds earth)? Fly to the "mun" (corresponds moon) or one of the other planets? Build a Lander and land somewhere? Or build a rover and make a trip on the "mun"? It lies by you! A successful launch is even an special goal for the first time. It's harder as it sounds. While playing, your physics-knowledge will increase, you will see what i mean. You can explore many planets, moons, comets and asteroids which each have their own challenges.\n\nMods:\nYou will find lots of mods which make the game unbelievable. More parts for rockets or space-stations, better atmospheres for your planets and moons and more. As well as other games, the mods aren't free of risk but for me there were only a few game-crashes after hours of playing (>100h).\n\nEarly Access Status:\nIt's nearly perfect, so you have the feeling to get an full game.

There are three gamemodes, career (you manage the actual agency with funds, popularity/approva, and research tech), science (same as before but just research) and sandbox with no limitations but there's almost no agency mechanics. Although because of that sandbox may sound like a lesser mode, the agency mechanics are really secondary.\n\nThe main gameplay is being the actual Kerbonauts and performing the mission, which you yourself can determine or you can take a contract. However building the rocket (or spaceplane) is just as important as actually flying it. There's a whole solar-system for you to explore, complete with asteroids and moons for some of the planets. Some of the planets even have irrational orbits, and some of those have moons with an irrational orbit to the planet. The game is realistic enough to be somewhat educational but loose enough to be a very fun game.\n\nThe game is somewhat difficult due to the loose-realism, but that is a good thing for myself. I'd rather a game be too hard (this game definitely isn't) than be too easy. Everytime I start a new save, I learn something new along the way everytime. Whether it's a more efficient way to get into orbit, faster way to dock, or even a way to use less parts for a rocket. I always learn something new, and I love that.\n\nAlso, KSP is one of the few games ever to exit early-access and actually be complete with no major bugs.

In career mode, It takes a patience, common sense. There is alot of trial and error. I had seen alot of the reviews and decided that I was going to not visit any guides or wikis, Which made the game much more gratifying knowing I figured it out on my own.  After nearly 100 hours into the game, im getting ready to restart career and impose a hardcore mode on myself.  As stated on the main page of the game, this is early access, therefore still alot missing from the game, you almost have to make your own fun out of it ATM.  But even with features still missing, the game is alot of fun, I always consider a game worth the money if I get a dollar a hour out of it, this game far surpasses that, even off sale.\n\nThe physics of the game are very solid and very unforgiving, just like it should be. The amount of stuff  you can do is only limited by your imagination.  From orbiting a planet, to a complete Space Station around the games version of Mars.\n\nI must say too that I am a bit worried that the updates have been so slow to come out, I got the game a few days before the asteroid missions and the sale (doh).  Come to find out that was the first update in something like 3 months.  That being said, I have also seen in rviews that the modding community is awesome, so that may make up for the lack of updates in a small way.  Becuase of my self imposed blackout on anything that could be a spoiler, i have not looked into the mods myself.  But after I get tired of my hardcore mode, thats my next stop.\n\nAny questions, feel free to ask in the comments section.\n\nEdit: I finally had to look up how to transfer fuel.  Spent 3 hours clicking on a docked craft trying to figure it out. :/\n\n"THIS GAME IS:\n10% LUCK\n20% SKILL\n15% CONCENTRATED POWER OF WILL\n5% PLEASURE\n50% PAIN\n\nAND 100% REASON TO DOWNLOAD THE GAME!"\n\nI saw this on another review of another game, and it was so true, i had to steal it. =P","April 6, 2014","true","512.4"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

Nevertheless, this is one of the greatest games I've ever played. It's difficult, yes. But not as difficult as it sounds or appears first. Watch Scott Manley's tutorials on youtube and with a little practice and patience you will be able to do all the cool stuff you can imagine. I don't want to misslead you, it can be a rly hard and even a little frustrating during the first couple of hours, but it's also so damn rewarding once you got past that initial learning courve.\nSo what does this game offer? A huge sandbox experience with lots and lots of content that has been build up and polished for about 4 years! You want to build a rocket? a (space)plane? a shuttle? a station? a moon (mun) lander? or a probe that travels across the whole system to reach the gas giant far out? Than do that! No one is stopping you! Your imagination is the limit, as much of a cliche that might sound like. But it's true and if you don't believe me, watch showcases of people on youtube. There is everything from Star War's podracers to real life replica missions.\nAnd if you fail a couple of times, there is nothing bad about it. The game manages to make failures fun. How? Cause you see stuff spinning, crashing and exploding in ways you couldn't even imagine. This is the unique experience of KSP that I've been enjoying with the greatest community I've ever seen. If you have a question, than simply post it on the forum. There are so many experienced vets out there that help each other and especially the new people with theire knowledge and skill. It's a rly unique group of people that has kept the forum alive ever since the buggy first steps.\nYou might ask yourself where the hell you might take the inspiration from to build new stuff after 100th of hours. The answer is simple. KSP is easy enough to be fun once you get used to the basics, while still being acurate enough to build real life replicas from the Apollo and Space Shuttle Aeras to modern missions and designs like SpaceX's reusable boosters or Virgin Galactic's space ship one. It's all within the possibilities of this sandbox.\nAnd if you want something more SciFi orientated? Then get a mod like interstellar or near future and you will get everything and more right at hand. Even for the type of player that enjoys a harder and more realistic simulation type of game there are easy ways to adapt the game to be just that. The moding community of this game is just huge. There is everything from physics driven algorithms that simulate hypersonic reentrie effects to adding whole new planets and solar systems. There is just so much content out there that you will literally never be able to see or play it all.\n\nLong story short, after playing this game for years I sudenly felt a need, driven by nostalgia, to write this down and promote the best investment I ever did when it comes to a game.\n\nI hope you will enjoy it as much as I did and still do!

I've played 600+ hours and I've hardly scratched everything you can do in this game. I can easily say, without exaggeration,  I'll be putting another 1000 hours if not more into this game. Games these days seem to go onto the market at 60$-120$, if you include all the DLC or pre-release shannanigans, for about 4-5 hours of enjoyable gameplay, 20 hours if your lucky. With Kerbal Space Program they're not even charging 50$ with a guarantee of continued FREE updates. I can not express enough the level of enjoyment anyone with any amount of interest in space exploration will get from this game. If your like me you'll get hooked on this game and before you realize it you'll have put in 100 hours of gameplay and be working towards setting up mining operations on any number of distant worlds, complete with orbiting space stations and/or colonies. Did I mention you can capture and/redirect asteroids then do whatever you want with them? Yes, that does include mining and/or building bases on them.

I have this game since the early access alpha and with every update you can see that the devs know what they are doing. You will fall in love with the Kerbals as soon as you set one of em up into your uniguely build Spacecrafts and fire it to the next planet. It is sooooooo much fun to see if your construction works out.\n\n"The way is the goal" This game will give you great satisfaction if you like seeing how your plans unfold.\nAlso the game knows how to raise the difficulty bar 1 by 1.

If I could sleep with a video game, this would be it. KSP is beautiful in almost every way! I can blow up my Kerbals on the launch pad and try and build a boat out of struts (I can't), or if I want to I can land on alien worlds and watch alien moons rise.\n\nIt runs on my Mac, making it a game that can run on anything short of a rotary phone. Really, any game that can run with an i3 processor and is this GOOD then should be a yes in everyone's book :D\n\nThe real fun comes when things go wrong. If it seems to go right first try, it won't. I think the best moment have come in failure. Once I killed Bill, Bob and Gwent Kerman after landing to rescue another Kerbal on a far-away moon before realising I was on the wrong side of the moon. While attempting to get back into orbit, I lost my velocity and plummeted into a xeno-ocean. Xeno - sea? Xenocean? I don't know .-.\n\nIn addition, this game has no cons. The stock game has plenty or shortcomings, but the modding community is the most diverse community in existence for a game on Steam...\nYou want clouds? There's a mod for that.\nYou want to eject you Kerbals and watch them parachute to safety? There's a mod for that.\nYou want to fly them up in an AI-flown spaceplane then shoot an AMRAAM missile at them from a ground base, then watch them jump out just in time before landing perfectly on top of the mountains? There's a mod for that. Well, actually about 12.\n\nDon't bother with that astrophysics degree, play KSP.

I have built over 2000 spaceships for the Kerbals so that they can get to the various planets in their solar system. It is a process of trial and error in building these spaceships since they tend to fall apart quite easily and when they do it has catastrophic results for the Kerbals manning them. I have conducted inventory this past Tuesday and I can report that as of this past week 26,000 Kerbals have lost their lives in service to their planet. The families of these Kerbals receive my deepest condolences and I am putting forth a motion with the Interplanetary League of Kerbal Nations (ILKN) to aid in providing financial reimbursement to help with funeral expenses and life insurance claims. In watching these brave Kerbals and Gerbals lose their lives I have inadvertently discovered a new passion. Killing Kerbals is to date the most exhilarating thing I have ever done. I thoroughly enjoy watching the life slip out of the eyes of these Kerbals as they are crushed under structural beams after the collapse of a separator ring or as they suffocate after the cabin is flooded with carbon monoxide due to an engine malfunction. I am therefore issuing a call to arms to the rest of the galaxy. This vermin has lived under us for long enough. I will petition the various solar systems to supply me with the necessary forces to complete my mission of mass genocide. I see the future as a joyous one where, having crushed the Kerbals, the various nations of this great galaxy of ours can rise above the shattered remains of the Kerbal Empire and join hands as a beautifully diverse master race. This is the promise I make to you my listeners: I will thoroughly destroy the Kerbals and everything they hold dear. I will be the scourge of the Kerbal Empire and will not rest until every last insignificant spec of Kerbal scum burns and I can take my place as king of the ashes. I swear by the staff of Jehovah that by the time I die, I will have destroyed every last trace of the Kerbal Empire and its commonwealth. I will meet every Kerbal I find without mercy or remorse. I will expend every resource I have to wipe the Kerbals off the face of every planet that they inhabit. No matter where they run, no matter what loyalist swine that they cower behind, I will seek out and destroy them with brutal efficiency. There will be no leniency, no forgiveness, no chance for appeal. The empire and its corrupt senators will be a stain on the face of history and even after their obliteration I will work tirelessly to make sure that this stain is thoroughly bleached out. I am also announcing the re-militarization of the Koprulu sector once the arms embargo is lifted. The annexed Kerbal colony on Duna will be used as a base of operations for this re-militarization and I am currently in negotiations with the Aldemari Republic to supply several Minotaur-Class fleets for the rebel navy including battle cruisers, frigates, and capitol ships. We have hired many privateering firms including the famous Black Sun crime syndicate to undertake raids on the Kerbals' trade routes. These privateers should not be needed for long however, as I have issued a galaxy wide decree that whoever does not cease all trade with the Kerbals by star-date 66155.3 will suffer the full extent of my power. In order to destroy the Kerbals we must also neutralize the solar systems allied with them. The Kerbal allied systems as well as their hired mercenary groups are as follows: Kairon, Flaxo, Kelnar, Ara Aquarii, Aquila Icarus, Calesius prime, Zodiac-355, Oculus cloud, Xm-934, and BBA 19J. I will give each of these systems a chance to pledge allegiance to the rebel cause before they are utterly destroyed. In order to disarm the vast Kerbal military I have issued arrest warrants for over 3000 Kerbal army officers. Further I am offering a reward of 600,000 xaljats to anyone who manages to apprehend the band of outlaws known as the Kerman Brothers. I will see Commander Jebediah Kerman of the 35th Kerbal regiment brought to justice for his crimes against the United Galactic Federation and will use the planet destroying laser currently in development to obliterate his home world of Kerbin prime while he watches. I can assure you that he will not be able to talk his way out of this punishment like he has so many times before. He will be helpless to save his planet just like I was helpless to save mine. In conclusion, I will impart with you the famous last words of Admiral Jorney Kerman before I flayed him alive at the Battle of Kelnard's pass: "I really wish I wasn't here right now. Uh oh now my skin is gone."\n","May 6","true","220.3"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","86","25","29","26","3"

I feel confident, based on the developers track record thus far, that during beta any issues that remain will be resolved and the game will receive the polish it deserves.\nits also worth mentioning that theres already a thriving modding comunity for this game that adds additional features.","November 26, 2014","true","371.7"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

Successfully piloting a craft and docking with a space station is seriously no joke. Flight dynamics are also very realistic with you actually having to have at least a rudimentary understanding of how a rocket or airplane works in order to have one you designed actually ever get off the ground.\n\nAll in all this provides a game that has you spending hours designing a ship straight out of your imagination using a very wide variety of parts in order to accomplish any mission you could think of like launching from Kerbin, landing on the Mun (moon) and then returning those happy little guys back home. All of this happens while constantly having chuckles at the witty ship part descriptions while in Build Mode or the quirkiness of the Kerbins that you're having go on EVA's outside your space station.\n\nMod support is huge and makes the game essentially extendable to anything you could possibly ever want from a space sim.\n\nIf you like space sims you will like this, trust me.","May 1, 2015","true","277.7"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

Here we go.\n\nThis game has one of the most helpful community ever. Its modding potential is unlimited after the release of 64bit game, and just the community itself is worth buying the game.\n\nEven without modding, the stock game itself is already marvelously designed and delivered by Squad. It worth hundreds of hours of gameplay.\n\nWith the orbital model of Patched Conics, you can apply many real-life maneuvers like exploiting the Oberth Effect. You can play the game without KER or Mechjeb 2, as you can just use the third Kepler law to calculate most information you need just by the apoapsis and periapse. Of course, it is also easy to play just without all the fancy math, just with lower efficiency ;)\n\nI would personally describe playing the Kerbal Space Program as an interactive learning experience. It is one of the best learning experience I've ever had, as it requires me to learn the real-world science. I would have to thank Squad for creating this incredible game, as it opened the door of aerospace engineering as well as astrometry.\n\nWith the introduction of KSPedia, it is now even easier for new players to get into the game. In many senses, with the help of Realism Overhaul, Kerbal Space Program is a simulator. I do not care what people say about how "the Orbiter" is the only real space simulator, as Kerbal Space Program is one of the best indie game, hands down.\n\n\nEDIT: CKAN saves life. Seriously.

Image them looking up at the stars and trying to reach them.  We went through our own space program in the 60s, and we got a taste of what it means to leave your own gravity well.  Well, certainly we can't be the only species trying to do this.  Playing Kerbal Space Program makes me feel connected to every other species attempting to leave their home planet.  It's not just us on Earth, but everywhere.  KSP makes me feel like I have NASA in my backyard and can throw together a rocket and try it out whenever I like.

A pirate ship.  In orbit.  Hell yeah, it had cannons!  It could sail the stars as Odysseus sailed the seas, but curiously enough couldn't float upon landing in an ocean.  In this way, I discovered the need for testing.\n\nAnother time, I built a large, mobile glove-shaped buggy out of airbags that was designed to safely catch spacecraft that were landing at significant multiples of the speed of sound.  Sifting through the wreckage of that first test revealed serious flaws, but that's just the sort of can't-do negativism that further engineering tweaks can and will overcome as you play KSP.  Soon, the crack engineering team realized they could save millions by just installing an airbag or two on any landing vessel itself.  En garde, gravity!\n\nAnother time, I dropped a jeep on the Mun that landed on its side doors, trapping the Kerbals inside.  My OnStar insurance coverage did not extend beyond the atmosphere, so I launched a rescue mission to flip the Munar jeep.  Then, I toured the Munar craters in a jeep.  The rescue team had no way to return home and no other plans, so they hopped in for the ride.  Yeah, riding dirty in Kerbal Space Program.\n\n300+ hours in, and I've only begun building space stations.  I've only landed on a handful of planets and moons.  The call for exploration lures me ever upward, even though in my first ever rocket launch, I didn't know better than to not walk out the capsule door mid-flight.  As I fell back to the surface, my body aglow in the flames of reentry, a thought crossed my mind: maybe I should develop a large, mobile catcher's mitt for situations such as these.\n\nKSP is a game in which you decide where to go, what to do, what to make, and how many boosters you need to accomplish all of these things--much research has been done on this very subject before you arrived, and the data has always pointed toward "moar."\n\nKSP is challenging to learn--truly challenging.  It is also so, so very rewarding.  You WILL learn a lot, and you WILL explode.  Often, and, at least as you take your first tentative steps skyward, with great consistency.   But one fine day, as you become the first Kerbal to step on another planet, you will remember.  You will remember the first time you made it to space as the hook that did not let go.  You will remember your first orbital docking with nearly the same sense of relish as the first time you made love.  You will remember landing on the Mun--not crashing, but landing--and the look on that brave Kerbonaut's face after looking around on the Munar surface and realizing you had neglected to make plans for bringing him back home.\n\nNext time, you note, you will be more prepared to cross another item off the list of things that can't be done.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=279953413\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=279959604\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=222482550\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=229530080","June 24, 2014","true","567.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Spending a few minutes slapping something together that barely gets off the ground can give some satisfying laughs. But when you've spent a good bit of time perfecting a craft and getting to the many milestones (getting airborne, breaking atmosphere, maintaining orbit, landing on The Mun) you'll have so much pride in yourself for accomplishing something that you'll feel like a rocket scientist.  The physics at play in KSP can allow a previously failed launch to have a chance of succeeding next time so taking several attempts is rewarded (don't give up).  Trial and error is what drives this game and if you love the idea of ironing out the wrinkles in your design and watching it pay off, then you won't be disappointed at all in KSP.

Fun!\n\nKerbal Space Program (KSP) puts you in charge of a space agency (think NASA) whose goals are... actually that's pretty much up to you. The game's career mode will give you missions you can accept, such as "get a rocket into orbit" or "land on the Mun (Moon)," and you get rewards for doing so such as research points to unlock more modules, prestige to do... stuff, and monies to pay for things. But really you can do whatever you please. And outside of career mode which structures your objectives and gameplay to an extent is a sandbox mode that lets you do as you please without worrying about unlocking things or having money for them.\n\nThe game basically has two main aspects (three if you include the Career Mode stuff described above): building stuff to send into space, and then launching that stuff and making it do other stuff. Designing successful rockets (and later on spaceplanes) can be a bit difficult, since you have to worry about stuff like the weight, the power of the engines, maneuverability, and more. The 1.0 Update plans to add a tool that will let you see potential problems with your designs before you actually try them out, but until then you basically just have to wing it and hope that your designs don't crash or explode in a spectacular manner.\n\nOnce you have your designed rockets (or spaceplanes), then you get to launch them and perform whatever "mission" you have chosen for yourself. You have to fly the craft yourself, which often requires great precision and timing. Assuming you don't just crash and die horribly, your biggest concern is fuel, and running out of it at a bad moment can make you go back down towards the planet (you did attach a parachute, right?) or leave you drifting in space unable to return home unless you can find some way to rescue them.\n\nThis is not an easy game even on easy difficulty settings, but it is one that can give a real feeling of accomplishment when you make successful designs, achieve your first orbit, make that fateful landing on the Mun, and much more. It gives you an appreciation for the difficulties that real world space agencies face when planning or performing such missions.\n\nAt the time of writing, KSP is still in early access, though its full release is not too distant. Regardless, this game is fully playable now and stands as one of the best early access games ever to make it to Steam. If you are interested in Science, and specifically space exploration, then you really should check this game out. Actually... if you like games period you should try this out. There is a demo, though it is of an older version of the game and therefore has far less than the main game does.\n\nDifficult, often frustrating, and yet an excellent game that makes you feel great when you succeed at something in it. :3","March 20, 2015","true","70.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

And the "building bricks" are based on real world counterparts - no teleporters or stargates here.\n\nShould this game have a story like Mass Effect and space trading economy like X3 series, it would be my dream game come true.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to everyone who dares to test his own creativity in building sophisticated craft that can actually fly and land on distant planets and moons.\n\nAnd You will have to land there if You are playng campaing mode, because that is a way You gather more science data for Your scientists and You will need that to learn better components for Your spacecrafts.\n\nThis game has also a huge modding comunity already that have created a lot of content that can extend a stock functionality.\n\nThere are also tons of tutorials on Youtube that will explain a game in detail and a dedicated wiki to learn more.\n\nTry not to be distracted by appearances of those kerbals - they will share Your passion of flying high and far away and they will show their appreciation if You do things right! :)\n\nHave fun and fly safe!","February 13, 2014","true","357.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/220200/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","Kerbal Space Program is probably the best Early Access game out there. Yes, it's even better than DayZ. It's an amazing game, and I don't even purchase simulators. If I buy a game from a genre I don't like/care less about, then you know that I knew something was up with the game. I'm not much of a Early Access guy, but this game was quite an exception.\n\nGraphics\nThe visuals, unfortunately, are pretty weak so far. The textures look like those from games where the textures are glitched and it's all blurry. The Kerbonauts are also not much better. However, the graphics look nice on occasion, so it's not bad everywhere. Not much to say about visuals in this game.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is much like a simulator (which it is) where you build a ship and launch it, and with the proper ship, you can either get to the Mun and beyond, or crash and burn and possibly kill Jebediah Kerman. And if you DO kill Jeb, then I will find you and make sure that neck of yours makes a mighty fine snapping noise as you collapse to the ground. Anyway, the construction is solid and is easy to learn. Just be warned though, you will need to know the basics to physics if you want to make a decent ship. To add on to that, the pilot controls are also solid and makes the game more difficult in a good way. Why else do you think I enjoyed FTL, Super Meat Boy, Dark Souls, and all of the other throw-your-controller/keyboard-at-the-wall simulators? The only con to the gameplay is that the learning curve can be quite steep and requires lots of blood, sweat, and tears (Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration) into the game. But, we'll get into replayability later.\n\nStory\nThe story? Well, there is absolutely no story in this game whatsoever. No trace. There's a small amount of lore, but that's it. The story to this game will NOT be counted towards KSP's final score.\n\nAudio\nThe audio is decent, but the noises keep looping and it sounds repetitive and it needs lots of work. However, I love the songs a lot, so that'll boost the score quite a bit for this game.\n\nReplayability\nThe replayability is very, very, very, high. This is one of the few games on Steam that could easily take 1000 hours of your life, sitting on the throne alongside Team Fortress 2, Dota 2, Skyrim, and a few others. There is so much trial and error in the game that for you to actually get to the Mun, it would take you hours after hours after hours. Look at the other reviews' hours. I only have a small amount, but let's use common sense: Most of the reviews have over 1k hours logged into the game, so what does that mean? Does it have high or low replayability? That's what I thought. The reasons the game is highly replayable was explained in the Gameplay part of the review already.\n\nVerdict\nIn the end, Kerbal Space Program is an impressive and difficult space simulator. Despite a few flaws, this game is well worth the price and is worth buying, Early Access or not. I highly recommend the game. Why waste your time dealing with connecting into servers and getting captured by bandits all the time in DayZ when you could build a bunch of ships and then watch them all burn to the ground after failing miserably and then decide that if Jeb dies, you need to restart the launch or else I WILL FIND YOU- I mean, you will get sad. Oops.\n\nGraphics- 5/10\nGameplay- 8.5/10\nStory- NONE\nAudio- 6/10\nReplayability- 10/10\n\n.:7.7/10:.\n\n+Monsterous amount of replayability\n+Funny ways to watch your ships crash\n+Solid piloting controls\n+Simple-to-learn but hard-to-master construction\n+Great songs\n\n-Required experience at physics and other things to understand the game\n-Mediocre visuals\n-Small amounts of audio, loops sound boring","July 31, 2014","true","21.2"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","3"

And because of that, when you finally do succeed in a Mun landing, or even your first Kerbin orbit, the amount of satisfaction is just insane. Because it's not *just* about better reflexes, or a stronger sense of strategy—You succeed in KSP based on *actual knowledge* gained during gameplay. (And many, many hours of tutorials and failure...)\n\nSo yeah. Get it.

Yes it's a long review, however again, this game deserves it.\n\nGAME DESCRIPTION:\nYou own the Kerbal Space Program and your facility is equipped to launch various rockets off the launch pad or aircraft off a runway to send items in orbit, dock with orbiting stations, travel/survey/land on other planets, conduct science experiments, take samples and materials from planets/asteroids, build bases on other planets, or just explore. Campaign mode allows you to start with very basic rocketry equipment and buildings in which you can accept contracts that offers rewards of money and science you can use to purchase upgrades of buildings and research additional items to further your mission capabilities. In addition, you can hire new Kerbals to your crew that includes pilots, scientist, and engineers and advance their effectiveness with each successful mission. If you'd like to skip to the good stuff and jump right into the action, you can play in Sandbox mode which already has everything unlocked and nothing cost money. Sandbox mode also allows you to save your progress so you can always comeback and continue sending things up in space.\n\nPROS:\n+The unbelievably accurate physics and mechanics are always fun\n+Near endless possibilities of various rockets, satellites, space stations you can build.\n+Can send fueling ports, stations, satellites, or rockets in orbit and let them orbit in real-time while you build something else to dock, refuel, rendezvous with it, etc. You could do this 100s of times and have thousands of things orbiting whatever celestial body you chose.\n+Can be played as a sandbox type game or campaign\n+The solar system is insanely vast. If you were not not speed up time in travel, travel time is very accurate. 2 days to get to the moon and years to get to the outer planets (in near real-time). Thank God they included time warp lol!\n+Extremely HARD at first = pure joy and satisfication when you accomplish what you're trying to acheive.\n+Music is fun and fitting depending upon your location. Beautiful galatic music plays in space\n+Beautiful space visuals. Although I'd recommend a few visual mods to enchance this\n+Minimal bugs/glitches. I've had one crash of the game in 60 hours, however I believe it was my computer :). Otherwise, I haven't ran into any gamebreaking glitches.\n+User interface for building the rocket is VERY user friendly and makes it downright fun to use your imagination to build something\n\nCONS:\n-I feel the tutorials are lacking. While there are some tutorials to help you get started and they're very helpful, There's nothing that really explains what most of the items to build your rocket do. Instead, most item descriptions are just funny little paragraphs that doesn't always explain the item's function. While I do like the comical approach and it seems fitting for the game, it should at least always say exactly what function the item serves and/or why you may need it. Or, there should be a tutorial on every item and it's use (like what batteries, docking ports, thermal reactors, decouplers, etc. do)\n-While I did state in the pros there's endless possibilites of what you can build, I still feel almost all items available are still lacking in variety - such as engines, fuel tanks, lights, batteries, RCS pods, science, structural, and aerodynamics to name a few. Mods do ease this and offer many more to chose from, however I've found many mods to be graphically glitchy and some I've found that do work I felt should've been included stock in game.\n-Campaign contract requirements are VERY aggravating at times. Sometimes they make no sense and feel out of place. For example, one contract has you test a specific rocket while submerged in water...really? So you have to launch, navigate over water, land safely in the water, and then boost your rockets while submerged - in which they do absolutely nothing other than just burn out...just weird, but ok (yes I realize some planets have water). Some people may like this, but I've found no use for contracts like these.\nIn addition to the above, I feel the contracts cause the campaign to way too slow and become frustrating due to them being tedious and many being repetive that require you to test the same item, but it just changes the requirements making it a pain in the ♥♥♥. For example, one rocket you may have to just test at 50,000km...easy enough. But then another contract will be offered to test the same item, but at 52,000km, not in orbit, and within 450-500m/s. So you may be at 52,000km but if you test it at 501m/s or 449m/s, you fail. Quite aggravating and again, this may not be a con for some, but I feel tests/contracts like these are a waste of time spending hours trying to get everything right, making the campaign move and feel VERY slow and near non-rewarding.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nThat said, if you like space or anything space related, get this...period. I've played 75 hours and I've litterally scratched the surface of what you can do. I've managed to place items into orbit, build and dock stations, orbit satellites for research, and land and return from the moon. However, I still have yet to learn building rovers, advanced science stations, traveling to other planets, etc.  When I zoom out after I've traveled to the moon and look at the solar system, it's insane how large the solar system is. It makes it look like I've just merely accomplished stepping out on my front doorstep - even though the in-game and real-world travel time was days. This game offers thousands of hours of gameplay and I've not come remotely close to losing interest. It's no doubt the best (if not only) realistic space-mission simulator with nearly an endless amount of possibilities and customizations. It lets your imaginations run wild. However, that said, be warned it's a simulator that takes patience! If you lack patience, this is not for you. But if you have patience, when you finally accomplish what you want the feeling of satisfaction is like no other!\n\nRATING: 8.5/10\n-1.5 as I do feel the campaign could be a bit better if it offered better contracts making it easier to get into, some item choices lack variety (again, alleviated with mods), and item's descriptions, tutorials, and purpose of use is severely lacking\n\nEdit: Thank you Kevin for pointing out the saving process. It's not described anywhere in game (that I could find), so thank you for that.","February 27","true","106.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","2"

You are given unlimited possibilities in a number of settings, be it orbit, on the surface of your home planet Kerbin, or even on another heavenly body, such as the cleverly named Mün, or Duna, a Mars like planet.  On the sandbox aspect, you are given loads of different odds and ends to do as you please with, and the only limit is your imagination.  Things like replica space-planes, and huge space-stations await you in this new universe. Don't expect to be a pro right away though, as fifty-one hours into the game even I still have mishaps. The KSP community is incredibly supportive however, and there are great sources for help. If you get bored with what the developers give you, it is made incredibly easy to add plugins and part-packs to the game, with a website called the SpacePort. KSP is a great game for all ages, too, because unlike the theme nowadays of shoot-em-up and gore, you are challenged with expanding the frontiers of your own race of little green men.","December 5, 2013","true","366.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Meanwhile on Kerbin, an enormous rescue ship is being driven to the platform, ready to shoot to the Mun and whisk Jebediah back. The countdown starts- 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... ignition. The thrusters fire up, and the rocket begins to grumble off the launchpad. Suddenly, one of the rockets explodes.  The main shaft collapses in a plume of fire, with shrapnel flying in every direction. Jebediah will have to wait another day.\nKerbal Space Program is a rocket building sandbox game, where you run a space program manned by little green Kerbals.

Check out Scott Manley's YouTube channel for in-depth learning on how to play, and just get right into it, it is well worth the buy, and the time.\n\n20/10.","March 30, 2015","true","107.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

The mod installation is as simple as putting the mod folder into your GameData folder, that's it.\nTalking about mods, the mod support seems to be great. I've never looked into modding it myself, but since there are mods adding mineable ressources to planetoids or doing complete mapping scans from certain orbits there is a lot of room there :)\n\nWho do I recommend this to?\n"Engineers": People that like to Trial&Error in games, that like taking challenges and eventually mastering them. In KSP, the difficulty of these challenges depends on you (i.e. sending two rockets with station segments into orbit or try it in one turn, which is more cost efficient etc etc)\n"Organizers": People that love doing stuff as calculating orbits (orbital period, "best suitable inclination" and so on), Thrust-To-Mass Ratios and all the tons of numbers you find in rocket science :P\n"Pilots": People that have fun with coordinating a vessel in space near a fragile station to it's docking port ;)\n\nMost of you will be all three of them, but interestingly you can lay your focus on whichever you want.\nAlso the humor of the game is amazing, so from my side:\n\nA BIG YES to Kerbal Space Program!\n\n(PS: If you decide to buy it now, check out Scott Manley's KSP tutorials. He's kind of the iconic figure of KSP tutorials and it will make your first hours a LOT more understandable)","January 23, 2015","true","204.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","14","18","3","0"

Air intakes on the under side of it, all of these things can be simple or ridiculously complicated (As in, you build a spaceplane, it looks awesome and when you put it on the runway, you start the engines only to find that the plane does the immelmann maneuver and crashes into the ground in a fireball as soon as it gain flight.)\n\nThere are also a lot of very well hidden easter eggs on other planets that are really hard to find without some videos giving you co-ordinates, one of the easier easter eggs is the monolith near the Space Center, it appears to be nothing more than a dot at a distance\n\nYou can succeed in this game and feel greatly achieved, with getting all them new modules with the science that you're going to get, or you can fail miserably and have a massive laugh with the 100 megatons worth of volatile kerosene going all over the place, destroying whole parts of the Space Center, until eventually a hell kraken comes and snatches you into space (This a bug that blacks out the screen and frazzles the altimeter)\n\nStraight 10/10 for me and likely many others","February 18, 2015","true","177.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","0"

KSP changed that.\nDuring more than one year of playing it and perhaps even 2000 hours of game time collected, I've never regret the spent money.\n\nAs this is a work in progress, it can't be fully evaluated, but judging by the current status, it has crossed the line of just having a potential to become big. It really became big.\nIts Unity engine doesn't allow it to be very flexible for the developers because the bottleneck is Unity itself. Nevertheless, the game graphics is visually appealing.\nThis is one of the most stable WIP games ever. Crashes are very rare even if one tweaks the game using various plugins and mods.\nIt's educational, it's open to expanding by others and the community is fantastic.

But I have a terrible memory and can't quite remember it.\n\nCould it be building your own piece of space debris, launching it with the hopes that it won't quite crash into the surface of the planet, and then setting your kerbal, who is likely quite dizzy or nauseated (maybe even lobotomized), into the surface of the planet and claiming said planet for the glory of SCIENCE!  No, that sounds pretty cheesy...\n\nMaybe it was Building a space station piece by piece and then attempting to dock these seperate pieces at precise intervals, only to accidentally fly through the near complete station because you didn't un-accelerate time fast enough to slow down (so much is wrong with that).  No that sounds frustrating...\n\nOh Oh, I know... It is undoubtedly creating a series of unmanned orbiting vehicles that all orbit in such a manner that they would allow instantaneous communication across the star system of Kerbin if there was any need for such a thing when you are but one of a handful of signs of habitation on your home planet let alone the Kerbin System.   No that sounds tedious...\n\nOh yes, that is it... it is using your ineptitude at physics to break the physics engine attempting to create all of your science fiction romanticisms like the Death Star, a space boat, a Gundam, Star Destroyer, a Halo Station (or ringworld as I would prefer), any number of space vehicles in science fiction, as well as inaccurate replicas and jury rigged models of today's human cosmonaut program.\n\nWell whatever you enjoy, be it making a series of ICBMs and attempt to destroy your own base, or create complex rocketry designs to reach the distant planets, or even capture an asteroid and give Kerbin ANOTHER moon, or even giving Mun a moon (moon-ception)  You can do just about anything you can imagine in KSP.  Except the things you can do in game like COD or GTA, well, except kill people, but hey accidents happen.  Especially when you strap several hundred tons of rockets and fuel on haphazardly in an attempt to get into orbit.\n\nSo yeah KSP, flight sim, orbit sim, crash sim, not an explosion sim, non-newtonian physics sim, or underwater exploration sim...  I mean, just get this game... its not rocket science... well it doesn't have to be.","May 23, 2015","true","68.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","10","12","4","0"

There's so much to do, and so many places to go. A whole  world  solar system of freedom and opportunity awaits!\n\nYou can play in sandbox, science mode, or career mode. In sandbox mode, you have unlimited funds, and everything is unlocked. In science mode, you have infinite funds, but you need to unlock things with science. In career mode, you have limited funds and science, as well as reputation. You must accept contracts from companies to fund your space program, and progress through the tech tree.\n\nThe game has in-depth tutorials and a guide, as well as different scenarios to try out. The community around the game is great, and Squad (the company that makes KSP) is great. I have seen them implement many things the community asks for, and even bring modders on to the team to help.\n\nSpeaking of mods, there exists a plethora to choose from. Whether you want to make your game easier, harder, better looking, more realistic, or crazy, there is a mod for you. They include things from graphics overhauls to aerodynamic overhauls to vast quantities of new parts to autopilot systems you code yourself.\n\nThe game is both simple and challenging at the same time. It's easy enough to build a rocket, but can you make it fly? Can you get into orbit? How about to the  Moon  Mun? What about  Mars  Duna? The answers may be no at first, but you learn. You slowly understad more and more, and after playing the game for a while, the answer becomes yes. And in that moment, you realize: "Hey! I know how space works! This is orbital mechanics! And I know how to do it!" It gives you a wondrous feeling of accomplishment, each time you do something new. That feeling barely fades, as I still feel my heart swell a little every time I land on the Mun.\n\nSo go ahead, give the game a shot. It may seem daunting, but it's really quite fun -- and deceptively simple.\n\nHow hard can rocket science be anyway?","May 10","true","298.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","1"

I saw a video about KSP which depicted it as a silly and unrealistic game that made fun of serious efforts to explore space. Thankfully, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give the game a go. I'm glad I did.\n\nThis is a game where I can design, build and fly spacecraft designed any way I like.

I can recreate past and present missions, learning how to land on KSP's Moon analogue, or construct and dock with a space station of my own design. I can also act out proposed future missions by visiting KSP's Mars analogue or other planetary body analogues.\n\nThe game is not yet fully mature. We do not yet have realistic re-entry heating. We are not yet able to establish bases to utilise in-situ resources. These features are in development and will be implemented in due course. The next feature we are eagerly awaiting is an overhaul of aerodynamics and implementation of payload fairings and cargo bays.\n\nKSP is realistic without being inaccessible.

There's so much for you to do on this game, with its realism, and the hundreds of parts it tosses at you when you open the VAB or Spaceplane Hanger. The planets, moons, and asteriods each have their own challenges and perks that differ from the rest. For example, Duna is farther from Kerbin than the Mun, but Duna has an atmosphere, which allows gliders and rocket planes to fly. The rocket parts and aerodynamics are nothing less than amazing, with engines that benifit and hinder you, fuel tanks that carry diffrent fuel sizes, muiltiple prepulsion methods and more. Not interested in rockets? Well, you got a full hanger with airplane parts choking the catalog. You can still aim for space, however, as it still supplies you with rocket parts, in whice you turn planes into SSTOs (single stage to orbit FYI), and vice versa. The exploration factor is nothing less than infinity. You got 7 planets, most of them with moons. They all have special chractheristics in which you either hate or love. Me myself,  having been  to EVERY planet and moon in this game, has not tired out yet. Why? Instead of just exploring, you can colonize and conquer. You got docking ports, which leads you to massive space stations. You can build bases on explored planets to supply fuel or power to passing ships. This game is truly amazing, even the slightest of space geeks will have fun in this. I recommend it fully 10/10","November 13, 2015","true","011.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","10","13","3","0"

From colonizing the vast outer regions of the Kerbal solar system to screwing around and conrtucting massive starships. There are a vast amount of mods for this game and even mods to add more planets and stars to even further extend your exploration. Mods for mining, colonising and just building the most massive space assault carrier. This game is truly worth its asking price. It has lasted for over 4 years and I believe with the communities support it will be able to last even longer. I love this game. Just seeing Jebediah smile after a crash or even whilst he is crashing is a damn awesome feeling.

Flight model and air resistance and heat management are now unremarkably good (that's a good thing).  Many flight controls are still difficult to discover, but the worst of the old flaws are gone (it no longer trains you to rely on the space bar being "do the next thing" only to later on make that an insta-lose-but-only-sometimes button). While you're in-game it still won't show you the keyboard shortcuts and you kinda still have to find out about the quicksave key (F5 save, hold-F9 load) yourself before you can go check the keys midflight.  You can't always quicksave.\n\nCaveats as of 1.0.2: This game will enthrall you so thoroughly that _hours_ will pass by.  If you don't  quicksave regularly then sooner or later (leaning towards "sooner") you'll lose an entire evening's meticulous and irreproducible work.  * Quicksave isn't really for exploring different flight plans, it's for defense against the UI and to a lesser extent some minor bugs. Don't use the hard-mode option that shuts off quicksaves. * Go into the settings input options and shut off the staging function in any but staging mode.  The default setting makes the space bar a pun (but only sometimes): toggle RCS between linear and rotation mode, oh, and also jettison your last engine.  The controls shouldn't be more counterintuitive than orbital mechanics. They really shouldn't. * If you hit the can't-place-a-maneuver-node UI bug, try deleting other maneuvers, farthest away first. That sometimes fixes it for me.\n\nRagdoll Berts and a space program.  Charming, genius, progress requires ambition (it's a sandbox, after all), very demanding but always with clear reason game.  I think this is going to remain my builder of choice for a long time.","May 2, 2015","true","506.7"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","11","15","5","0"

Go a little deeper and you will find a surprisingly complex and intelligent space simulator, where you will learn something new every time you play it. Honestly, I'd pay twice the price for this much fun. $22.99 is a steal, and 300 hours in, I'm looking at 7 cents per hour for a hell of a good time. The mod community is also very vibrant and adds literally anything you can imagine: new paint jobs, altered physics, communication, fusion-powered engines, warp drives, hyperspace, and even asteroids.

Kerbal space program, Coming in I didn't even understand how much I didn't know about orbital mechanics! But Kerbal space program unravels these secrets in a paced and comprehensive order and most importantly, its fun while doing it.\nEverything from the designing the rocket to performing the actual mission, you don't get near space the first few tries but you feel yourself improving every time, and every stage feels awe inspiring. My first Apollo style moon landing was a highlight to my summer for the sense of acomplishment it entailed.\nEven faliure can be fun, run out of fuel to early? mess up your design and realize after you make it to Duna?(mars), figure out what parts of the mission are salvageable, what science can still be performed. My first mission to Duna ran out of fuel before making into orbit but I was able to use the rotation control rockets to alter my path just enough to fling around its moon and slam into Dunas thin atmosphere to slow myself down.

This generally involves building some sort of craft capable of a specific task and/or reaching one or more bodies in the Kerbol system. It has multiple modes to cater to different playstyles, a simplistic but harsh physics system and a lot of parts for you to choose from when making your contraptions.\n\nThe gameThe characters you control, named Kerbals, are cute and most definitely insane. They are the heart and soul of the game, and they seem to like danger a whole lot more than being alive. The brilliance of Kerbal Space Program lies in the way you approach problems. You’re guaranteed to fail almost every time you launch a new craft, and while on paper that doesn’t sound that fun, the game’s revert button allows you to recover from all the launch mistakes and the quick save feature allows you to recover from fatal mistakes on your longer missions. I’d say that most of the fun even comes from your misfortunes: having to send out a second rescue party to send the first and the people originally in danger is something that never ceases to amaze.\n\nThe fine printThis game is fairly easy to learn, but it will require a lot of commitment to truly grasp everything you can do in this game. While simplistic, the physics are accurate enough to provide a fair representation of ‘true’ astrophysics, and because it’s so close to real life it shouldn’t take too long to understand what is expected of you.\n\nThe scaled down solar system means you will be playing in a lot shorter sessions than you’d otherwise have to, but this game is still very long. Missions can take up to ten hours and beyond. This is most certainly not a game that you can just hop into for a bit. This does mean that this game’s value is insanely high if you’re looking for something to spend a lot of time on. There is no clear end-game, so if you enjoy the game enough you could end up playing it forever.\n\nThis game is really easy to mod. So any problems you have with it can be solved by installing more mods, and they often also add content: anything from EVA construction to colonisation to FTL drives. You name it, there’s probably a mod out there for it.\n\nThe game’s performance is good, with a few bugs here and there. None of them are gamebreaking though, and most of them are due to the engine. I’m hopeful of what Unity 5 will do for this game, but even with Unity 4 this game will run on a lot of systems. Because the game isn’t a graphical powerhouse it actually runs quite well on laptops, but the processor does need to be good to handle all the physics.\n\nSummary+ High value for money\n+ A large amount of parts to choose from\n+ Simple yet fun physics\n\n- Long play sessions\n- A few bugs\n\nConclusionWhether you like building insane contraptions, setting up missions to places far away, or just have an unreasonable obsession with space you will find a lot to like in this game. And who knows, maybe you’ll even pick up a thing or two about how spaceflight works.","July 1, 2014","true","181.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

It's only rocket science. If the idea of putting parts to build various flying machines in appealing you you I highly recommend you try this out. It's a got a bit of learning curve but it is worth it. To make things easier on yourself you can skip the in-game tutorials (they mostly confused me) and hop on YouTube instead. Scott Manley has a good tutorial series. This is the link for the playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEmqpOkQZCl5SZB5t0vXuxE0\n\nYou'll probably want to at least make some attempts at flying prior to jumping to the videos as a lot of the fun of the game can come from failure and cool explosions... not that you'll have a shortage of those later.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/binchyster/recommended/220200/","binchyster","Binchy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/binchyster/","131 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMy most rewarding gaming experience ever comes from rescuing one of my kerbals, trapped on the Mun after a routine science mission had a rough landing, damaging the parachutes of the vessel and rendering it incapable of returning to Kerbin. The rescue mission had to be quick as the life support (TAC life support mod) was running out for Jebadiah Kerman. After rendevousing with the damaged ship in a low Munar orbit, the rescue vessel set about returning to Kerbin with much less fuel than planned. It was tooth and nails as the vessel only just managed to deorbit itself, skimming through Kerbin's atmosphere multiple times before finally landing, all astronauts safe.\n\nThat is the thing about Kerbal Space Program, everyone has a story about the game which they want to tell. You design your own missions- they go well, success! they go wrong, rescue mission! You design ships and redesign them. You plan your missions, and you fly those missions.\n\nThe game is still being developed and new features are gradually getting rolled out. And if you ever want more, the awesome modding community has you covered, adding ♥♥♥♥-loads of more content and gameplay, from extra parts to requiring life support for kerbals or even a connection link for unmanned vessels.\n\nP.S. I recommend checking out Scott Manley's youtube videos for tutorials and to just see someone who does awesome things in the game.","January 16, 2014","true","261.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Sandbox is exactly what it sounds like, minus the cat poop and the lost action figures (never forget you little Anakin!).  In sandbox, you build a rocket ship or a space plane, and you go to space.  Half of the time...  The other half is spent trying to figure out why in the hell did that stage not properly go off, only to realize you didn't actually attach your rockets to that stage...  But anyways, sandbox mode is the mode you play when you want to make a giant ship in a few minutes and fly it into the sun.  Because why?  Because Science!\n\nThe second mode, Career, is basically "Here's a couple of pieces, those guys over there are the pilots, see if we can't get this into space."  The beginning parts are spent mindlessly launching rockets into the ground because you have no idea what you are doing, and when you finally figure out what you're doing, you can have some fun.  In Career, you gain science points for everything you do.  Like, everything...  Such as EVAing a Kerbal while you're still launching, dropping a mysterious goo on the ground, into the water, into space, into orbit, and pretty much anywhere you can drop that goo, you'll get science for it.  You can get science for successful missions, unsuccessful missions, missions that you didn't think could go wrong but did, missions you thought would never be possible but was because who needs logic.\n\nThis is definitely one of my new favorite games out there.  Although, as much as I'd hate to admit it, this game is MUCH better being played on a controller (or joystick, which is awesome if you can), just because the little fine tuning you have to do can be a pain when using your keyboard.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that I freaking got Jeb stuck into orbit with no jetpack fuel in Career mode, and he isn't even in the ship anymore, and so the only way I could save him is by very, VERY precise calculations, that I'm too lazy to do and end up just winging it.  I mean, I could just terminate him and he'll respawn eventually, but it's FREAKING JEB!  I CAN'T KILL JEB!\n\nSo anyways, I hope you found this review helpful, and I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this game to people.  But, I suggest packing enough fuel to get out of orbit, or wait until you have docking ports...  Then you won't end up with Jeb stuck in space...","December 5, 2013","true","26.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

Well, lucky you, if you are a science nerd, rocket fetish, got a lot of A plus on you Physic's examinations, KSP is the perfect game for you to spend some time for a adventure. From my experience, KSP has no flaws, apparently my expertise aspects are limited to artistic titles, video games,game designs. For science, I'm not even an amateur but if you ask me if there are any features that I wish was in the game or will be added, I would like see more solar systems and most importantly flora and fauna.\n\nSo far my suggestions seems intriguing, but there's a problem for gamer who wish to see faster results, if so,I warn you that you won't go further into the game. That will be a waste of money, in my opinion. KSP has some necessary built in tutorials but that won't be enough for someone like me, amateurs, to get into orbit. Don't worry, that doesn't mean we are just going to watch others building fancy things. There is a joke about KSP, whoever ask a question in KSP community thousands reply "Scott Manley"! Luckily we have our self a mentor on Youtube to teach us all the essentials that is required to "enjoy" the game.\n\nAssuming you are an amateur like me, whichever mode you started you will either get overwhelmed by all the parts that is displaying in front of you and you can't even make a damn thing out of them, or you are staring at a 4 or 5 parts and you have no ideas where this is going. If you are not a patience gamer, KSP can only be a cheap fun, you build some weird aircraft and spacecraft, fly around, click some buttons. Then KSP is definitely not a game for you and that's why spend times watching Scott Manley's tutorial is required.\n\nI had a hard time to learn the essentials, but Scott Manley is professional enough if you pay attention to his lessons. Most of the gamers will probably think, why the heck do you need to learn to play a game? Well KSP provide a strong realistic feelings (career mode), gravity, weight, budgets, design possibly everything that is related to build a spacecraft in real life is in this game. You can play it casually but you won't fully dig into this game.\n\nFailure will be inevitable, especially to people like me, I know very little things about spacecrafts, going through atmospheres, get overheated, can't even lift off the ground, can't return to ground, can't make a round orbit, suck at rescue mission, can't go to "moon". These frustrations are necessary but will eventually beat you, and you will rage quit. I remember I was doing a rescue mission where there are 3 astronauts need to be saved in low orbits, I successfully extract all of them but I got overheated and exploded when returning to "Earth". I spent merely 6 hours on that mission and yes, I didn't save it.\n\nOverall, KSP is a high quality space simulator, and a lot of potentials for you to discover, forgot to mention that KSP fully supporting mods which make this game even better! I do suggest you play the original game first then try some new mods. KSP gave me a lot of good memories, the moment that I reach the "moon", the moment that I reached north pole, you really feel that all that efforts worth it and it is so thrilling and satisfying to achieve something in KSP. That's what makes this game so special, after I became a decent player, I started to realize why conquering space is not that easy, as the title says. A true experience about learning and practicing space and aero technologies that you will feel. Highly recommended!

It's *not* easy, which I happen to like. I'm sick of games that I can beat in a matter of hours. Kerbal Space Program is hard - hard as ♥♥♥♥ in some cases - and as such it can be incredibly rewarding to land on a new planet, moon, or just build a cool new thing.\n\nThere are some fairly significant downsides:\n\n1. The tutorials are terrible. Maybe I'm just stupid? I ended up having to figure most of the game out myself and spent tons of time looking things up on YouTube and the game's Wiki.\n\n2. It's a *little* slow to start. Because the controls are a bit obscure at first I wasn't sure I was going to like it. I ended up playing it immediately after buying it, becoming frustrated and shelving it for about two weeks. But I am *SO* glad I gave it a second chance.\n\n3. There're still some weird bugs, but the KSP team seems quite active in working them out. It's still only just now in beta so bugs are to be expected. Unfortunately the worst one I've encountered managed to corrupt my best saves, forcing me to start over after having a nearly completed tech tree.\n\nHowever I haven't had this problem again in over a month now - maybe it was fixed, maybe I'm just lucky.\n\nAnyway, despite these problems, the game is ABSOLUTELY worth every penny and I'm incredibly excited for future content and witnessing the continuing development of this game. Obviously as a video game it's not quite the same thing as actually being an astronaut, an engineer or ground control, but it does give you an entirely new appreciation for what NASA, the ESA, Roscosmos, and any other space agency do every day.

That's not to say there isn't a lot there already... but the potential is huge!\n\nRegarding the game itself... build it, fly it, crash it. Build it again, fly it again, crash it again. Things will go wrong, adjustments will need to be made, and kerbals will get lost in space. It's ok though because that means you can try to rescue them! When that fails, try to rescue both ships at the same time with a bigger ship!

It is very challenging, but also extremely satisfying when you accomplish something. In addition, it quite expands your knowledge about physics.\n\nThere is no other game like this, but in some ways it bears similarities to Dwarf Fortress - both games have sharp learning curve, are extremely difficult beyond the very basics (albeit KSP is pretty forgiving) and the lesson you learn from them is that losing is fun.\n\nKSP simulates physics very well, it includes objects burning when reentering atmosphere, different gravity on various bodies, and the whole solar system is actually simulated (planets and asteroids orbiting Sun, moons orbiting planets), while the game is a sandbox allowing you to do whatever you want. Do you want to fly to the Moon? Sure. Do you want to do research on an asteroid? Sure. Do you want to take that asteroid down  to Earth? Sure! (But it's not gonna be easy!)\n\nOh, and you do actually learn some physics in the game. You have to. This, however, lets you understand space exploration and why is it so difficult and takes so much time. After all, in KSP you get to do a lot of stuff yourself!\n\nThe game doesn't have any drawbacks either. Perhaps some rare bugs or crashes, but very few. Other than that, the game is flawless.\n\nIt's not just the best space game. It's actually one of the best games ever made. I recommend it to literally everyone.

KSP is a brilliant little game for everyone from clueless cosmo-naughts to astrophysicists. It's also remarkably versatile, so boats, rovers, and planes are all things too. The mechanics are solid, the graphics aren't too rough considering the game's scale, and there is a vibrant and diverse modding community.\n\nEasily one of the best gaming purchases you can make, as long as you don't mind days of your life being consumed by the need to put little green men into space.","September 18, 2014","true","194.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You can keep a basic understanding and learn a few tricks to get the most out of the game without putting too much thought or time into learning it but you have to be able to break down at times and understand that somethings you can't always learn on your own with this game. Or if you're a total science, math and space nut you can really get into the math to fully get every inch out of your rockets and vessels so there's something for everyone. Also there's mods. It can be a lot of trial and error as well which makes the game a true challenge.\n\nNEVER KILL OR LEAVE JEBEDIAH ON A DESOLATE PLANET HE IS THE ULTIMATE\n\nDesign rockets, gather science and do missions or contracts to gain moolah to make bigger and better vessels and rockets to take to the outter portions of the solar system.

Laugh at your new build, where you've strapped on dozens of boosters, and be rolling on the floor during launch as you watch everything slowly (or, quickly) fall apart.\n\nIf you know vaguely of the space program and think learning something about how to get things into space will be fun, this is a science kit in a box. Have all the fun above, plus you'll learn what "freefall" and "orbit" and "retrograde" really mean with hands-on experience. Relive the Apollo missions to the moon (or for Kerbals, the Mun), simulate real NASA missions (or try to and learn much as you stay up all night trying to make your rocket fly correctly). Addictive, cute, and fun.\n\nIf you've mastered space docking and other-world-landing in other games, you'll still appreciate the excellent physics and the cute take on what is often a difficult genre to break into. The physics are all there and are quite good- you could teach a class using many of the features even in this early beta. With community mods, the physics get even better (or crazier, as you wish). Fans have even programmed automated burn correction programs so you can do a professional job.

Everyone seems to make comments about this games steep learning curve, but the reality of it is, while you are struggling trying to figure out the controls and dynamics of this game, you are probably having a load of fun blowing rockets up and watching your little green men screaming in horror (except for Jebediah, who is always cheering).  Nothing about this games learning curve is a deterrent.  It admittedly took me a couple hours to get the hang of things myself.  But while I was learning, I was having a lot of fun just messing up stuff and laughing at how quickly (or slowly) my launch fell apart.  Now that I feel I have "mastered" space docking and world landings, I'm still finding tons of new things to do, explore and try to recreate.  Also, the physics in this game are spot on, all the way through.  Its amazing how much learning this game really seems like it can provide.  I highly recommend this to all.  KSP is addictive, fun, and hilarious.\n\nKSP is still in early access.  So there is a lot of new content still coming out, and the community for this game is great.  Some of the community mods I've used have really blown me away.  This game is only going to get more awesome moving forward.

Not only do you get to build your own rockets, spaceplanes, and whatever else you can think of. You can also build your own learning curve as well!

The community, and modmakers only make the game even more in depth and fun!\n\nYou don't like modding your game? Kudos to you vanilla extremist, I still haven't even done everything in stock KSP yet.

With almost unlimited mods and tutorials you're pretty much settled to spend a load of fun hours in this game.\n\nThe only negative point in my opinion is that for some people the challenge will be too much. You don't just go to the moon or fly by an interstellar planet like that, there will be a lot of planning, thinking and most of all; failure. Seriously, the difficulty of this game can make you lose your ♥♥♥♥. Imagine this: you're a wedding planner and you've been planning for days, only to discover that you're one cupcake short when the wedding is almost over and because of this you can start all over. It's a bit like that, but can you imagine the satisfaction when you actually pull something off? It's a feeling no other game can give you, trust me.\n\nAlso, what I mentioned before, the community is amazing. Ever heard of Scott Manley? You will after you buy this game. There are many more like him that make tutorials for doing the craziest stuff, and a load of others that make humorous video's using KSP. Then there are mods, that can make the experience that much more challenging, fun or realistic.\n\nSo all together, I would definitely recommend this game.

It's tricky to master but you are rewarded every step of the way and it's not even final release! My favourite single player game of all time.\n\nNow ver1 is out! Wow... what can I say, it's better than I could have hoped for. Everything that makes KSP so special has been fused together with epicness. I fail to see how you can not love it, the cute little green men, the disasters, the sucess and true freedom. Go whereever you like, build what ever you want, fail, suceed and just have too much fun. If KSP was a drug it would be tobacco. I have to remind myself it's just a single player game because it sits up there with the best games of all time not just single player games.\n\nBeauty: Every player who playes KSP will have a different path to sucess or failure. There is no right way in KSP, you build what you can to get the job done. Trial and error and even with 2000+ hours on KSP I have not built the perfect rocket because there is no perfect. If you forget an antenna or a parachute etc your mission will fail but this is how you learn.\n\nAs for the new ver 1 mining stuff 10/10 it's just so polished as a game I cant praise the game enough, fantastic+epic!","April 15, 2015","true","063.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","2"

BY FAR....\n\nMy favorite video game of the current era.\n\nThose who know me, know I'm a rabid Fallout and Resident Evil fangirl. I can't call this game my favorite yet (Fallout 2 still has this title by a steady grasp) but KSP is a very close follower.\n\nTo sum up the entirety of this game in a few phrases or memes....\n\nThis game = NASA + Lemmings.\nKSP is hollywood rocket science....\ncollect ALL THE SCIENCE!\n\nThere are 3 modes of play. The first mode is sandbox. You get all the parts unlocked, you can build anything you can think of, and then explode it marvellously while trying to fire it up into space. The second mode, is Science mode. This unlocks the Tech Tree and the collection of science. Parts are restricted by the Tech Tree, visitable through the R&D building. Collecting science unlocks branches in the Tech Tree. This gives you access to more and more parts, until you're eventually at the end of the tree, and its basically like Sandbox mode. The third is Career Mode. Career is the fully unlocked version of the game, requiring you to balance limited parts (locked behind the Tech Tree, requiring the collection of Science), limited money (Rocket science is expensive! Ships now cost money, and you have limited funding. In order to get more money, you need to complete missions from the Mission Control building), and spontaneous explosive deconstruction.\n\nThe whole point of the game is to explore the Kerbol system. Its that simple. Build rockets, leave the planet Kerbin (third from the sun Kerbol), and visit all you can. The Kerbol System has 8 planets, Moho (like Mercury), Eve (Venus analogue), Kerbin (Earth-like), Duna (Mars rip-off), Dres (Small planet, light gravity, hard to land on), Jool (Jupiter wannabe), and Eeloo (Pluto if it was a planet!). Each planet has its own special features, moons, things to see, and difficulties in visiting.\n\nThe game has an INCREDIBLE modding community, which I recommend, and the YouTube community loves making crafts and blowing them up. I VERY MUCH invite you to watch Scott Manley's videos for learning Kerbal science and aerodynamics.... skills needed to blow up much less often than before!\n\nThe game still has its issues... I commonly find the Hell Kraken or ♥♥♥ Kraken (Community known bugs), but this may be due to the mods installed on my game.  The Windows x64 version is horribly broken, but the other versions are great.","May 23, 2015","true","491.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

KSP provides a Solar System and space technology similar to Earth's. Career mode gives an excellent context for performing "experiments"(go to place X and press button Y) to unlock better or different spaceship components, and has the freedom to let you choose what to attempt first, or go on free mode. Building a craft and putting it in orbit, going on to land a probe/rover/lander to a planet/moon feels fufilling. On the way doing spacewalks, crew reports, atmosphere/space experiments. It's a very involving game, solving the problems of how to reach a planet, slow down and land on it, and then get back. Ontop of being a fun game, KSP provides an easy way to grasp the concepts of space travel, and it's not overly complicated. Just pick the right parts, and fire your rocket at the right time and direction to get somewhere. Suffers a stuttering issue for many people, but it's not a gamebreaker.","December 6, 2013","true","396.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Careers, more parts, better aerodynamics and heating simulation.\nWhat I loved better is the amazing modders. Plugins and parts are always growing better, taking shapes and functioning more smoothly. Ferram4, bac9, Acea, BahamutoD, those guys are just getting more amazing than ever making more and more fantastic mods.\nSince 1.1 is almost out of the bakery, this indie game is making it's way through!\n\n\n\n====Previous review at 0.25 [Sept.2014]====\nWell, after a total of 100 hours of gaming time (steam doesn't count every time I started it directly from the directory), I was proud to say that I am finally a amateur engineer and pilot. In the gaming process, I found this game quite challenging despite earlier easy experience.\nGenerally, it's a pretty nice game though it's still in dev. Much of the game is something like Space Engineer, but this one is quite realistic(if you got some mods installed). Also, the game's setting is a highlight. A vast system of star, planets, asteroids and moons. Impressive if you like exploring. Also, the orbit and aerodynamic is just as great as its inspiring game, Orbiter.\nThe game is developed on Unity platform, and the x64 edition is just realeased and packed with some bugs, severe or unimportant. If it simply crashed or a Oops message appears, don't worry. It's just a bug ruining your game experience. But don't blame the dev team please! They are trying their best to make everything perfect, although it's just a "Good" now. Oh, and one more thing, this game is finally entering BETA testing! Mark the day on the calendar, Jeb! You'll never forget it!\nSo that is it, the game for a sandbox gamer, a rocket maniac or a airplane designer; even worse with the 0.25 update, it is also suitable for a sociopath who liked to design and destroy things.  Thousands of mods are available in the official forum[forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com]. If you are intrested in it, try out the demo in the official site[www.kerbalspaceprogram.com].\nIn a few words, this game worths the price.","September 7, 2014","true","126.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

KSP is hard in a "omg i dont understand this, what on earth is a Pe and DeltaV?!" kind of way.\n\nOne of the biggest issues new people to this game have is that well.... its rocket science. and most of us didn't walk into this game with a couple degrees. (though i feel like i could get one walking out)\n\nas a result there has been a huge disconnect for many people between the "what i need to know to enjoy this" and "what i actually know right now". amd this has caused many people to not enjoy there experience, or to quit the game altogether.\n\nNow with version 1.1, this issue has been addressed with an in game "wiki" if you will.  the rocket science 101, the up goers guide to the galaxy. and man did they hit it out of the park.\n\nnot only is it super detailed.... i mean like, detailed enough that despite having 1500 hours logged in game on steam alone (dont judge me) i was still able to learn something i didn't know flipping its pages.\n\nbut it is implemented in a way that makes it not only easy to access, and easy to use.... but basically screams "use me". right down to having a built in pause game button into the wiki, so you have the option of flipping a few pages on route to kill time... or to pause the game in a panic as you try to figure out why your 1 rocket just became 5.\n\nand yet, with all of that, its still super easy to follow.  I am glad they have finally cast away that looming shadow that has haunted this game for years and fixed one of the last real issues this game faced.\n\nand if you are wondering, yes.... the rest of the game is amazing too.","December 21, 2013","true","543.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is fun if you do. If not, this game is even more fun, as you have no idea what an apoapsis or periapsis is and how to calculate delta-v, which usually turns into a mission that requires a lot of manuvering, which teaches the player later on. Don't give up if you cannot accomplish what you are trying to do. Try again! This game will waste the time away with incredible fun.\n\nOverall score: 9.5/10\n","May 7, 2014","true","334.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

A steep learning curve means progress can be slow and difficult, but overcoming challenges become all the more rewarding as a result. You have the options to build spacecraft that are simple, complex, brilliant, insane, or a combination of all four. Then you get to fly what you've built and see whether you need to change the design, or merely how you fly it. With a community that is usually eager to help those who struggle, feedback and advice is seldom out of reach.

I am currently doing missions to explore and land on the moons of what would be Jupiter in the game, and I can still see a lot of content left for me to explore.\n\nOnce you get into the game a bit, I highly suggest looking into downloading some mods for the game, since it has a pretty strong modding community.\n\nThis game teaches you geometry, planetary motion, the effects of gravity in space and much, much more.

Just like most simluations, you have a carreer mode, in which you start off with nothing much but a rocket, a pod an some gadgets to learn science. As you explore more and more science, you open up more and more rockets, winglets and more science gadgets. I have to tell you the truth, games like this, Civ5 Simcity, i dont play EVERYDAY.

They're totally optional, you can fly wherever your fuel will take you.\n+This game taught me orbital mechanics.\n\nCons:\n-Rough optimization.  You may need a beefy rig especially if you want to make big complicated rockets.  However a small rocket can complete most of the in game challenges and is kinder on your system.\n-Control scheme can take some getting used to.  Everything is rebindable though.\n-Dedication to realism means that you're sometimes hitting the time compression button and waiting (and waiting) for an orbital launch window to open.  However this is only an issue for distant planets.  The moon is always nearby and ready to explore.\n\nThis game doesn't hold your hand because there's not one (or even ten) correct answers to any problem.  You may find certain tasks like getting a stable orbit or docking with another craft challenging, but there's literally hundreds of cheerful, informative youtube vids offering tips.

On top of that, there's the legendary Scott Manley on YouTube who has extensive knowledge and makes things crystal clear. Once you figure out the fundamentals in this game, things become quite a bit easier and you can really let your creativity run loose.\n\nAlso, this game can help you learn about orbital mechanics. KSP has helped tremendously with giving my interest in science a much needed boost.\n\nThen there's the mods. The wonderful folk who make mods spend lots of time seamlessly integrating them into KSP.\nChances are, if there's something you desire in KSP that doesn't exist just yet, there's a mod for it, or being currently made. When I started playing with mods, it opened up so many doors for creativity.\n\nIn short, KSP offers a lot. Especially as an early access title, and compared to a lot of AAA titles being released.\nI think Squad will become one of the best devs out there.\nI recommend this over and over again.\n\nUh.

The Mun has changed shape for crying out loud!\n\nGameplay: With the recently improved aerodynamics, The gameplay is superb. Watching your own rocket/spaceplane tumble back to Kerbin is an amazing feeling.\n\nOther: Contracts are wonderful. However, they feel a little repetitive in the late game. The tech tree is fun to explore and great for first time players. When multiplayer comes out I wont be surprised if I rack up 2000+ hours on here. If I were a therapist I would recommend this game to my patients because of how great you feel when you finally land on the Mun that required 5 Kerbal's lives to get there, and then planning a rescue mission!\n\nThe rundown: Buy this immediately.","May 25, 2015","true","338.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

My latest thing is spaceplanes, which can be a real challenge.

I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth, well Kerbin actually, but more on that later.\n\nWhether you actively seek out information on the inspiring missions carried out by the various space agencies around the globe or just catch the odd news report on the latest mars rover or comet flyby, you can't help but feel a certain sense of awe at the ingenuity and creativity that has led to these missions of exploration and discovery.\n\nNow we all have the opportunity to experience the glorious highs and devastating lows of running our own space program through Squads Kerbal Space Program.\n\nWhen you load KSP you'll be presented with a choice of three play modes. There's a full career mode where you'll have to design and launch your own missions, invest in research for new rocket parts and complete contracts for their financial rewards to help fund all of this.\n\nThere a Science only mode, where you can still enjoy the progression of the science tree without having to worry about balancing the books and then there's a sandbox mode, where you can let your creativity run wild without the restrictions of the other two options.\n\n\nSpace Camp\n\nTaking the plunge with the career mode, you'll first need to choose your fledgling space agencies name and flag logo.\nYou'll then find yourself looking down at your shiny new space agency campus. At present, you'll start with 3 wannabe astronauts, a very limited amount of rocket parts and an even more limited budget.\n\nThe first thing you'll probably want to do is take a look at the contracts available to you. These have specific requirements which when met will reward you both financially and often with a scientific reward which you can invest in the tech-tree.\n\n\nAstronaut Farmer\n\nPick your first contract, "Launch a craft from your launch pad and achieve an altitude of 5000m." It's then time to bolt a cockpit to rusty tank of rocket fuel, glue an engine to the bottom of the stack, light the touch paper and step back from the launch pad.\n\nIf everything goes to plan, your first rocket will fly straight and true (although not very high yet, you're going to need better engines and tanks before you can achieve anywhere near orbital height).\nOf course if things didn't go to plan, you could be looking a pretty fireball and a smattering of debris raining down around your complex.\n\nLet's assume things went perfectly, you're aspiring astronaut has earned his wings and returned safely back to the ground courtesy of the parachute you remembered to fit to the capsule. Not only this but your managed to achieve the required 5000 metres, completed your first contract and received the payment.\n\nNow it's time to visit the tech tree and plan your next mission.\n\n\nSpace Cowboys\n\nAs you progress through the game and your missions become more adventurous you will find a full, well balanced and very interesting tech tree to unlock, but for now, we only have a small amount of science to spend, so we'll pick a branch of the tech tree we can afford and see what goodies we get.\n\nOk, so now we've got some slightly more powerful engines, some fuel tanks that are a little less rusty and a mystery goo canister (a science experiment we can strap onto our rocket to generate our own science points so we're no longer dependent on contracts to generate our precious science).\n\nYou're also not tied to the contract system and are free to set your own goals and undertake whatever missions you can imagine. However each rocket part costs money and at the moment we still don't have very much, so it's back to look at the available contracts to see what else is available and achievable with our current tech.\n\n\nGravity\n\nSeveral completed contracts and a few catastrophic failures later and our space agency is about to earn its stripes. We've managed to send various science packages to different biomes on Kerbin, (Kerbin is your home planet, it's an Earth like analogue and home to the Kerbals, little yellow aliens that look more than a little like the characters from the Simpsons).\n\nAnyway, we've explored the deserts, grasslands, the oceans and mountain ranges of Kerbin, We've even managed a touch down at the arctic where we planted a flag and everything!\n\nNow we are ready!\n\nJebediah, our brave astronaut, is strapped into our painstakingly over-engineered rocket, we've already achieved a stable orbit with this design and now our sites are firmly set on the Mun (Kerbins Moon).\n\n\nThe Right Stuff\n\nOur valiant rocket roars up through the atmosphere, our carefully set staging is working perfectly, we've jettisoned our solid fuel boosters, the sky is darkening, we're in space above Kerbin.\n\nA few burns of our upper-stage engine later and we're in a circular orbit. A quick check of our fuel supplies let us know that we "should" have enough to make it to the Mun and hopefully back again.\nA long, carefully timed burn later and the Mun is starting to get pretty large through the cockpit windows.\n\n\nApollo 13\n\nThe landing was touch and go, we lost one of our four landing struts as we skimmed the surface but we are down and our Lander is stable.\nThe cratered surface of the Mun stretches out before us. We run the various science experiments on the Lander (the science generated will come in very handy the next time we visit the tech tree). We hit the key to extend the ladder, open the hatch and Jebediah bravely takes a small step for Kerbal-kind.\n\nWe plant our flag, we write a poignant plaque, we play with our jetpack and we scoop up a surface sample for the sake of science then we're back in our Lander.\nWe look towards Kerbin, small and blue, we're ready to go home, we hit the button to ignite the Lander engines and... nothing.\n\n\nRed Planet\n\nThe loss of Jebediah on the Mun was a devastating setback, but we've learnt a lot since then.\n\nWe now have new and improved technologies, we've returned safely from the Mun several times. We have a large orbital space station in high orbit above Kerbin and we're about to undertake our most ambitious mission yet.\nA manned mission to the red planet Duna (It's Mars guys).\n\nThis is the wonderful thing about KSP, there is always a new frontier, another challenge to overcome, another horizon to explore.\nAs it stands at the moment, the Kerbol system consists of one star, seven planets and nine moons. You can also discover, track and intercept various asteroids that litter the system.\n\nIf this isn't enough for you, the modding community for KSP is one of the healthiest and most active I have seen. There are countless mods you can download and use in your game, from texture packs and rocket parts to whole new star systems to explore.\n\n\nA Space Odyssey\n\nFrom what you've read so far you may think that Kerbal Space Program is a finished title, this is not the case, it is still very much in active development.\n\nIt is updated regularly and each patch not only refines what is already there but also brings something new to the table.\nI've barely brushed the surface of the universe of possibilities which awaits you in KSP.\nIf you have any interest in space exploration then this is a must have game, not a must have game when it's finally released, this is a must have game right now!\n\nKSP is simply amazing.\n\nTo see the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/review-well-home.html","November 15, 2013","true","674.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Learning curve is quite steep, but once you understand it the experience is priceless. Some of the features are much simplified from real life rocket science due to technical and gameplay reasons (no n-body physics, less punishing air resistance model, etc), yet it is still quite challenging for beginners (including me lol).\n\nWhile the vanilla version of the game is already almost perfect, it is greatly improved by the mod supports. There are tons of contents and mods in the repository, like adding a far more realistic physics (better air resistance model, realistic planet size, experimental n-body system), adding sci-fi and far-future engines (like Alcubierre warp drive and wormholes),  adding new robot parts (yes, you can build Macross' Valkyrie and Gundam) and adding a whole new exoplanet system. Heck, there are even programming mods if you want to challenge yourself to fly your own space ships just by code!\n\nSo, in Kerbal Space Program, the sky is not the limit.","March 23","true","104.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

We might not be able to explore our solar system, launch countless space stations and monsterous rockets in real life, but virtually anything is possible in Kerbal Space Program. This is ultimately how an early access game should be done, and I'm writing this on the launch day of 1.0 as it's coming out of Beta. It's come a long way with a massive community of modders out there, which thankfully are not going to turn into paid mods--and developers who listen to, as well as have hired members of the community to help with the game.\n\nIt can be relentless, it can be fun, and at times hilarious. Whether you're an absolute beginner, have some rudimentary knowledge of rocketry--this can be great for people of all playing styles and ages. You also don't have to dedicate a whole lot of time--jump in for 5 minutes, or a few hours.\n\nWant to just blow up rockets? That's fine.\nSpace Station nut with no goal of exploration? You're missing out, but that's fine too.\nAre you like me and love building entire networks of probes and satellites? Ah, that's fun and quite the challenge.\n\nThe experience is quite something unique, and I can't recommend this enough.

Instead of tirelessly assessing rockets to see if they will work, engineers just throw something together, plop some astronaughts in it, and send it on its way, often to a fiery end. Instead of checking fuel lines, or decouple joints, or even just the ability of a rocket to stay together, astronaughts get stranded in deep space when the command pod gets ejected instead of the empty fuel tanks, or the rockets break off from the rest of the spaceship and swoosh off into space. No calculations are made to ensure that the rocket has enough fuel to travel to it's destination, and mission after mission fails to even achieve orbit.\n\nThat is Kerbal Space program.\n\nTrial and error is the name of the game (wait, isn't it called KSP?), and explosions are often the goal. If your first launch doesn't cause a Kerbonaught (Kerbals are the ingame species of space travellers) to die in horrific fashion, or leave most of the rocket on the launch pad because of an explosive malfunction, you are doing something wrong (or more accurately, right).\n\nEssentially, if you enjoy space travel and designing contraptions (as sometimes you don't want a rocket, maybe a VTOL is more your style), this game is for you. If you enjoy setting your own goals and then setting them lower, this game is for you. If you are a rocket scientist, or if you are not a rocket scientist, this game is for you.\n\nI suppose if you prefer to do things right, you can enjoy this game too. With the help of mods and/or a good understanding of space travel, you can easily develop rockets that work, but it is still very rewarding. Instead of trying to even crash into the Mun (in-game Moon) you can rather focus on building a space station around Jool (in-game Jupiter), or make the game harder by adding life support and communication networks.\n\nNow, this game is not instant gratification, and it is not easy. If you prefer quick games, easy games, or games with specific goals, KSP may not be for you, but if you have even the slightest interest in space travel, buy this game, you will not regret it. KSP is a truly fantastic space program sim, simplified enough to make it fun, but still very focused on the true fundementals of rocketry: orbital mechanics, thrust to weight, specific impulse etc. (And trust me, if you get addicted, you'll figure out what those things all mean).\n\nSo throw caution to the wind and launch your skyscraper, or bring an asteroid crashing down to Kerbin (in-game Earth), or fly some kerbonaughts into the sun, it's your choice, and the sky isn't even close to the limit (or that would make for boring rocketry).","April 3, 2014","true","226.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As a kid, I've always dreamed of becoming a pilot, of a spaceplane or airplane, and this game lets me play with the realistic aerodynamics/physics of air/space travel, and it does it right.....oh, and it's still in beta! Except for minor glitches here and there, this game is perfect and VERY well made. It lets you build any rocket/spaceplane/airplane you want and fly it to distant planets/celestial bodies, land and return, all to complete missions to get more science, which you can use to unlock upgrades for your vehicles.\n\nRight now, I've made the sexiest spaceplane you can imagine, which can get into orbit around Kerbin (home planet), transmit data and return back to base, in perfect shape. Kinda like an upgrade of the Space Shuttle (since it doesn't need external boosters to get into orbit).\n\nSee, this game is extremely realistic, so you get to learn a lot about the exact orbital mechanics NASA workers are required to know. I used to think getting into space was just firing a rocket straight up, but realistically, you need to have a high surface velocity so you can get into orbit, otherwise, you're wasting a ton of fuel on either flying far away from home or falling back to the earth due to gravity. There isn't zero gravity once you leave the atmosphere, that's only because there's just as much gravity the other way, due to your orbit in which you're constantly falling, but have a high enough velocity to generate an equal G-force the in the opposite direction. And if you want to go to the Mun (moon), you'll need to use your orbit to slingshot yourself to the place where you and the Mun moon will be at the same time, since you must take into account that the Mun also moves in an orbit.\n\nI swear, you'll learn a TON about orbital physics, as well as you'll have a lot of fun building your spaceship however you want. And if it crashes to the ground, you must think about which part was misplaced to cause the crash, getting you in this trial and error loop until you FINALLY fix up the whole thing perfectly. Then you can think of its purpose-transport vessel, science lab, satellite launcher or a long distance traveler to a distant celestial body etc. etc. There's so much science to do, so many new ideas to think of and so much to learn from this game. Get the game and prepare to ignore every other game you have in your library because this game is out of this world!

If you're interesting in nothing past CoD of Duty: Goats, then stop reading now.\n\n---\n\nKSP is complex and realistic (mostly) space travel with a twist: it's clear. So instead of being a sleep-deprivied, coffee-addict flight controller who needs to recite more instructions than should logically be in existance, you are simply given the controls the fly the rocket - WASD, camera, throttle, and so on. There is no clutter.\n\nKSP has a lot of freedom in what to do in it. Recently, the Campaign mode was introduced, which tasks you with balancing the reputation, budget, and science of the Kerbal Space Program whilst pushing further and further and building up to greater things. If you prefer the simpler things, there is also the Science mode, in which the only restriction is what parts you have to unlock, or the Sandbox, where everything is given on no limitations.\n\nThe main protagonists in the game are the Kerbals. Assuming you are fine with the prospect of cartoonish, green panicking-astronauts screaming as your rocket flies into mountains at Mach 5, KSP's light-hearted side appeals to everyone. Your little kerbals will grin like children at a Minecraft Convention as they gracefully land on the Mun, or enjoy the views of a gas giant and it's moons. Upon landing, you can plop down a flag and claim this ball of regolith for you: because in KSP, the solar system is yours.\n\nKSP has many oppertunities. You may endeavour on projects from a reusable shuttle, to space station, to moon base. If you have the time and ideas to make something, possibilities await. Assisting this is the diversity of the modding community: on a parallel to Minecraft's, the modding community is very large and it should even be noted that many ideas have been incorporated - like the C7 Aerospace parts, whose creator was hired for the staff to help develop them, and the soon-to-be multiplayer function: something that was off-limits for the staff before, until it was proven by a modification that multiplayer and KSP can indeed go together.\n\nThe Official KSP forums have areas for user built craft and items, help and assistance, and pictures and discussion. It's worth a visit if you have any questions, need a helping hand, or simply wish to browse the latest craft available.\n\nIf you're interested by KSP at this point, don't hesitate to consider buying. It's an excellent game and will continue to improve - because it's still in development.","May 15, 2013","true","249.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

One and only thing which is a little bit uncomfortable about Steam support for KSP is no Workshop. Mods should be also supported by Steam considering how many people are using them. Above all, Workshop, that's the only disadvantage of Steam support for this game. But on the other side, even without Workshop, getting mods and setting them off in your game is not problematic at all.

The modding community and community in general surrounding this game is just fantastic, with so much going on all the time that you will always have something to do. And now that the career mode is in the game, each update makes things more interesting and makes setting and acheiving goals that much more satisfying.\n\nOnce again, if space flight and planetary exploration interest you, this is your game. If managing a complex space program is your idea of fun I am sure this will soon be your game, though with mods it can be your game right now. The way Squad is supporting modding and making updates means that this game can be just about anything you want from a game if your interested in Space simulations and fun.\n\nAnd of course you can't beat the explosions when it all goes just that little bit wrong :D","December 12, 2013","true","335.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you're interesting in nothing past CoD of Duty: Goats, then stop reading now.\n\n---\n\nKSP is complex and realistic (mostly) space travel with a twist: it's clear. So instead of being a sleep-deprivied, coffee-addict flight controller who needs to recite more instructions than should logically be in existance, you are simply given the controls the fly the rocket - WASD, camera, throttle, and so on. There is no clutter.\n\nKSP has a lot of freedom in what to do in it. Recently, the Campaign mode was introduced, which tasks you with balancing the reputation, budget, and science of the Kerbal Space Program whilst pushing further and further and building up to greater things. If you prefer the simpler things, there is also the Science mode, in which the only restriction is what parts you have to unlock, or the Sandbox, where everything is given on no limitations.\n\nThe main protagonists in the game are the Kerbals. Assuming you are fine with the prospect of cartoonish, green panicking-astronauts screaming as your rocket flies into mountains at Mach 5, KSP's light-hearted side appeals to everyone. Your little kerbals will grin like children at a Minecraft Convention as they gracefully land on the Mun, or enjoy the views of a gas giant and it's moons. Upon landing, you can plop down a flag and claim this ball of regolith for you: because in KSP, the solar system is yours.\n\nKSP has many oppertunities. You may endeavour on projects from a reusable shuttle, to space station, to moon base. If you have the time and ideas to make something, possibilities await. Assisting this is the diversity of the modding community: on a parallel to Minecraft's, the modding community is very large and it should even be noted that many ideas have been incorporated - like the C7 Aerospace parts, whose creator was hired for the staff to help develop them, and the soon-to-be multiplayer function: something that was off-limits for the staff before, until it was proven by a modification that multiplayer and KSP can indeed go together.\n\nThe Official KSP forums have areas for user built craft and items, help and assistance, and pictures and discussion. It's worth a visit if you have any questions, need a helping hand, or simply wish to browse the latest craft available.\n\nIf you're interested by KSP at this point, don't hesitate to consider buying. It's an excellent game and will continue to improve - because it's still in development.","May 15, 2013","true","249.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

I definitely recommend it if you love space/space exploration as much as I do.  The physics aren't exactly 'real world' but for a simulator they are phenomenal.  If you're a trial and error kind of person, you'll enjoy it.  If you're a patient person, you'll enjoy it.  If you're a person able to learn things, you'll enjoy it.\n\nThere really aren't any full tutorials in game, but the kerbal wiki is rich with material.  It's still early access, but for an early access game it's definitely blown me away.  You start off at a space center on an earth-like planet 'Kerbin.'  You can then either build a rocket from scratch or load a pre-made one; I recommend the latter just to get a feel for the game.  Once you know what you're doing, you can pretty much decide what you're doing from there.\n\nThey've added a career mode recently, and I think it holds some promise.  So far you perform launches with a limited amount of parts for your rockets and conduct experiments at different altitudes and locations.  Those experiments will get you 'science points' which are spent to research a new technology on a tech-tree.  The said techonology will unlock more parts for your ship to further your launches which in turn further your experiments.  More points, more parts, more research.  It goes on.  Career mode is still in development so I expect a lot more from it in the future.","June 24, 2014","true","111.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

What can I say about Kerbal Space Program other than buy it.   Buy a copy for yourself, buy copies for your family memebers, and buy copies as gifts for your friends.\n\nHands down the best money on entertainment I have ever spent.  I've spent more hours than I care to admit to playing this gem of a game and in addition to the sheer joy and feelings of accomplishment this game gives its users you will also find yourself learning a ton about orbital mechanics in a fun and exciting way.\n\nThat feeling of accomplishment is so core to the Kerbal Space Program experience.  I can't think of a single KSP player who doesn't have a first docking story or loads of screenshots/videos from their first landing on another planet.  The list is endless with this game.\n\nAnother great part of the KSP experience is the community here and on the main forums.  The mod community is large and very active.  Mods for this title will blow you away!!!  So much so that some mods were swallowed up by the developers and the mod developers now work along side Squad.\n\nIf you have not yet bought this game I invite you to download the demo here on Steam or from www.KerbalSpaceProgram.com  After downloading the demo hit Youtube and grab some popcorn for the hours upon hours of tutorials and general fun surrounding this game.  If your anything like me it won't take but 5 minutes in the demo before you instantly see the value of this game.\n\nClick buy!!!

Hitting Alt+F4 does also not fill Jedebiah Kerman with EVA propellant so he can get back to his orbiting space ship. Hitting Alt+F4 also does not reverse the 40 minutes you spent getting to Duna, only to realize you forgot Newke Kerman. Hitting Alt+F4 does not revive your sanity after going back to your vehicle assembly, putting Newke Kerman in your pod, flying back to Duna, and not having enough fuel to slow yourself down, going 30 m/s over the limit, and killing Newke Kerman. Hitting Alt+F4 also does not make you feel less stupid about getting rid of your landing rockets, and putting on four parachutes because you realized that Duna has an atmosphere. Hitting Alt+F4 saves you from embarrassment when you pull up your steam overlay, and realize you messed up your amazing trajectory to Minmus by hitting the Shift key to pull up the Steam overlay, only to do it again and tell your friend about how you're stressed and angry because you just messed up your path to Minmus, only to be cut short because you made yourself an escape trajectory out of Kerbin because once again, you hit Shift.","August 11, 2015","true","205.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","1"

Their silly facial expressions when faced with the certain doom of being in one of my contraptions adds a whimsical side to an otherwise straight forward sim game.\n\nAnyone who loves NASA or SpaceX, anyone with a passion for all things science, anyone who likes to stir in a bit of learning with their game playing, this game is likely for you.

If you however know what you are doing and/or have been following someone who knows what they're doing you should have no problem at all getting into this game.\n\nIt features many planets, their moons and in the future even an asteroid belt you'll be able to interact with all from the comfort of your own room/NASA mission control centre.\n\nYou can build everything from rockets, space planes, landers, probes and god knows what.\nThe game also features modding support and mods for the game can be found on the KSP site. Mods can add everything from boat parts, weapons, tools for making robots and mechs, new parts to add to the already pretty big library of parts and even customized planets.\n\nThe game is however somewhat unstable and building large stations etc can often cause horrible lag on all but the beefiest computers, it is however only a problem when you build VERY large stuff and once the game is finished the optimization will no doubt be better than it currently is.\n\nI truly recommend this game to any and all of you! There is something for pretty much everyone in this game, if there isn't then mods have probably added it.\nIf your PC can run this game, I see no reason for you not buying it. Trust me the game is worth every penny but if it's on a sale you pretty much have to buy it. Your life is not complete without this game. Get it now.

You build Spacecraft like Rockets, Landers and Rovers and try to get them to other celestial bodies in the simulation...or you can mess around with your creations and create huge deadly fireworks, that works too ;)\n\nWhat makes KSP so special to me is the sense of achievement it conveys when you finally get something right. Let me make this clear right away, KSP is not a simple or easy game. Your first hours will consist of hillarious failiure (if you don´t consult any guides).\n\nBut once you get your first stable orbit, it feels like you really achieved something, which you did, getting a functional spacecraft in orbit is NOT easy for a beginner. And it only gets more complex AND awesome from there. In Sandbox-Mode, you have no goals beside the ones you set for yourself. Want to go to the furthes planet and set up a network of probes there? You can do it...if you can do it ;)\n\nKSP consists of two main modes while you play: Building your vessels and then launching and controlling them. The cool thing is, KSP is not only fun, it also teaches you some things about Astrophysics, even if the physics here are simplified.\n\n\nBottom Line:\n\nIf you like thinkey, slowpaced games that let you build and lead your creations to success, if you AT ALL like Space and the wonderful endeavour that is traveling to other celestial bodies, careful maneauvering and putting your very own flag down on the moon (you can totally do that btw), you HAVE to play Kerbal Space Program, one of the most ambitious, brave and rewarding games about space you will ever play.\n\nOne final word about Early Access: KSP is in development, yes, but it already offers SO much content and possibilites, let alone Mods for just about anything, that I can see no reason not to jump on the KSP-train right now. The sooner you get it, the sooner you will feel that satisfaction when the blue sky fades, the stars shining brightly above your small vessel while the sound of your rocket slowly gets quieter, only to be replaced by the serene soundtrack and a feeling of awe when you´re confronted with space.\n\n\n...you can probably tell how much I like this game ;)\n\n","December 15, 2013","true","71.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It feels amazing when you first ever orbit the kerbal earth or when you first ever land on the moon using the rocket/aircraft you have created.

The title of this little gem is Kerbal Space Program ( no I have no idea wtf a Kerbal is):\n\nhttps://kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php\n\nI was bored at the time so I figured wth and downloaded the demo\n\nhttps://kerbalspaceprogram.com/demo.php\n\n\n\n54 hours played later(according to Steam)it took me 5 hrs (played) just to reach a stable orbit and once I discovered the joys of calculating/plotting planetary intercepts I was hooked.(side note: as it has a pretty healthy mod community if one finds orbital transfers, intercepts, docking, landing, lifting, orbital construction, or piloting in general un-fun; there are various auto pilot mods to take care of some or all of the "fiddly bits" for you.  There is no "official" auto pilot as yet, that is planed further down the road.\n\na couple of screenshots of my first Mun (yes Mun not Moon)Landing in the demo...well landing is such a subjective word\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=169992980\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=169992928\nThe game is currently in alpha testing; Uses the Unity game engine; currently has only sandbox mode available(although the next update is going to start implementing career mode elements); has a fairly healthy mod community; Early access if you choose to do it is $23 US. It is single player.  Worked with Windows/MAC/LINUX\n\nThe demo has 1 planet and 1 moon\n\nthe full game has an entire solar system loosely based on ours\n\n\n\nThe premise behind the game is design/build/launch rockets, landers, rovers, space planes, space stations, and scientific probes while not blowing S*** up.  The freedom of the design elements of the game is pretty impressive in itself (at least to me) I spend way too much time in the VAB(Vehicle Assembly Building) Again referencing the community if you find this part tedious..yup ready made designs are there for the breaking.  Approved mods can be found in the spaceport site.\n\nhttp://kerbalspaceport.com/\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course like any alpha there are "issues"  the biggest to my mind is the limitation the engine introduces.  At some point one learns that performance drops off significantly with increasing part counts.  As stated earlier it uses the Unity game engine an independent community designed engine.  This means unlike a lot of games KSP relies more on CPU than GPU it also can run on only 1 processor core.  These means past a certain point increasing performance requires Overclocking your rig or using less parts in your designs. 300-600 parts tends to be the avg big drop-off range.  The issue is significant enough there is even a cpu performance database\n\nhttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/42877-CPU-Performance-Database?highlight=database\n\nI've found  KSP to be an extremely addicting little game(452 hrs played according to Steam) so if one is willing to look past it's rough spots (it is alpha after all) it can be incredibly enjoyable","December 5, 2013","true","369.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

And if you don't do your research... well crashing is fun too :)\n\nA game based in enough science to be very compelling and immersive, but fictional in all the right places to make it funny and casual.\n\nThe mods out there easily multiply the conteny a hundred fold.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erickliban/recommended/220200/","erickliban","erickliban","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erickliban/","216 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI think i'll begin this review of Kerbal Space Program with a few stories of things I have done in the game.  First is the quest I had to assemble a modular outpost on the Mun.  Complete with living quarters a solar array/battery bank.  It also had O2 and CO2 storage and a converter.  Finally I added the Kethane(Methane) drilling rig and a plant to convert it to usable rocket fuel.   Next up was the journey to research science from near sun.  I flew a space probe to various altitudes near the sun.  Starting at 1 million km, next 100km, and finally 10,000m.  The last altitude I discovered a fun glitch in the game where the suns gravity accelerated my probe to near the speed of light and it shortly disintegrated.\n\nAt its core Kerbal Space Program (KSP) is a physics simulation of a solar system and the player is given pieces to make rockets and explore the stars.  Of course there is sandbox mode where all parts are available and the player doesn't have to worry about money or unlocking more advanced parts.  In sandbox the only objective are ones the player must create.  But the real fun starts in career mode that was recently updated to give the player contracts to give them various objectives.  Also part of career mode is the need to balance money and reputation.  The way to unlock better and more advanced parts in career is by performing science.\n\nOf course you might be leary of KSP being early access, but I will say that in terms of content the game is amazing.  I'd buy it in its current state ten times over.  However if you're still not satisfied one of the games biggest strengths is the dedicated modding community.  Want to only focus on building ships and let the autopilot launch and land your crafts.  Theres a mod for that.  Want to add even more rocket parts, the ability to build and connect space crafts.  Theres a mod for that.  Want to make the game super realistic and add O2, CO2, and a realistic atmosphere where your ship can and will burn up during re-entry.  Or you could add Kethane, the games equivalent to Methane, that you can mine and make rocket fuel on distant planets.  Well you see where this is going :)\n\nFinally my criticisms.  The biggest one that I hope gets worked on by the devs is optimization.  The physics engine only utilizes a single core of your CPU.  This is frustrating because I have an AMD CPU and not only does it struggle with single core vs Intel but the game doesn't take advantage of my multi core CPU.  Remember that sweet moon station I mentioned, well it got too big and the game ran at ~11 FPS near my station.  Secondly if you install a bunch of mods the games takes a while to load.\n\nOverall if you love Lego and space exploration KSP is an amazing game.","August 16, 2014","true","219.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

People slaming on the door's of jeb, bob and bills cockpit screaming to get in.\nbob leaps to his feet attempting to run to the door, but at this point the screams fade into utter silence as outside the window of the cockpit showed kerbals being sucked out into space, fragments of their craft flying by along with limbs and mashed space craft parts zoomed passed their windows....\n\nbill is in a panic, unable to cope with the reality of what just happened to their craft, their crew....its all up to jeb now to maintain control of the situation of his mens minds and wits..\nafter a few months of waiting jeb,bob and bill where rationing their supplies from food, power, and also bill, who sadly was growing more and more suspicious with each passing day, jeb and bob speculated that it might be a case of "space maddness" and had a routine scedule of keeping watch over him.\n\n\nThis mission has now turned from a genocide attempt to a rescue as i send another craft out into space to try and resuce what little kerbals are left upon the "s.s genocide"\nonce there i have the last remaining few eject from their ♥♥♥♥ pits to come and join the next shuttle i made for the rescue mission.....i then start to rp just a little more...to obviously have fun and not be bored....here are the results.\n\nafter months ((in game)) of finally creating a shuttle to come and save the remaining crew on the "s.s genocide" bill came down with a case of space madness...when trying to have all three "jeb, bill and bob" get to the rescuse shuttle.\n\nBefore the shuttle arrived bill bob and jeb where limted on the last remaining snacks left in their mini fridge, inside where only three eggrolls left all with each of their names labled upon them.\nBob with no real fault of his own instead of eating his own eggroll with his name upon it, ate bill's instead, seeing as bob was not the sort to really read things correctly, and also he assumed it had a "B" on it, its ether his or bill's, who cared, they all still got a eggroll after all.\n\nBut Oh no, this did not sit right with bill....no, no, bill didnt like things of his with his name on them touched, or eaten from others....this was the breaking point for poor bill...this was the moment his mind suddenly became sluge and just snapped unable to maintain his emotions.\n\n"BOB!" Bill shouted in anger before suddenly attempting to murder bob with a surprisingly out of place pool noodle with in the craft.\npoor bob coward trying to fight back with all his might, but struggled until captain jeb stepped in.\ntrying to sooth things over between them bill suddenly attacked Jeb, attempting to strangle him with the pool noodle. But thanks to bob and his some what.....quick thinking, gets bill of jeb, they then struggle for a few moments on the ground until suddenly it came to a point where they ejected bill out from the space craft and out into space.\n\nThe pool noodle will be missed...for the poor thing met the same fate as bill kerban....\n\nfinally my rescuse ship arrives...its time for bob and jeb to come home..But oh no....i forgot to make room enough for both of them to fit....non the less more room for the remaining kerbals that still remained alive....But their not important in this story.\n\nBob decides to be the hero, he places his hand on jebs, his eyes where all glassey as if he was going to cry.\n"go jeb....go...ill remain with the ship...please, just tell my wife and kids....that their father died with two eggrolls....both very well cooked." he stated before shoving jeb out of the "s.s genocide"\njeb floated out into space toward the resuce ship with his hands out screaming "BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOB!"....took him atleast a good minute to reach the rescuse ship from the other ship....so....yeah....longest scream ever.\n\nfinally it was time, lets get this hero home.\nquickly i start the engines, we begin to take off toward kerban when suddenly on the way forward we ran into "bill"......no literally ran into bill....im pretty sure he is split in two.....\n\nBut still, jeb managed to get the ship back home, landing upon the ground of kerban to live another day to eat more eggrolls.....\nThe end.\n\n10/10 for eggrolls. rip pool noodle.","December 17, 2014","true","86.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

I also like seeing a company that gives back to people on a regular basis which I can say that Squad is also doing. At minimum by creating a "game" that creates a fun learning environment and giving this to schools is remarkable.

I have put many hours into KSP and yet I still don't know how to describe the character and depth this game has to offer.  It is perfectly situated in that place where silliness and fiction meet complex science and math to form a uniquely fantastic game.  The creative graphics, gameplay and interface are very well in tune with each other and work in tandem quite effectively.\n\nThe community add-ons greatly enhance the experience and are a must-have for those who like to spice up their missions.  The mod base is so extensive, you can incorporate everything from epic science modules and probe paraphernalia to loads of different rocket engines, solar panels, and landing gear.\n\nMost importantly however, you can in fact launch a kerbal into orbit, deorbit him, and watch him burn up in the atmosphere until he hits the ground at 120 meters per second.  Of course, if he lands head-first, it is interesting to watch as his indestructible helmet propels him several hundred meters back into the air.\n\nOverall, I believe that KSP is for gamers of all types and can be suited very easily to the user.  I can live with the cons because they're all either bound to be fixed or don't even matter anyways.  I always keep coming back for more kerbal adventures.\n\nSolid 100/10 because it makes me chuckle","January 15, 2014","true","745.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

They've managed to allow as much creativity as it actually possible at this current development level for simulation/strategy game.\n\nHOWEVER (it is a big however, i know) before you can actually enjoy anything like building a satellite to orbit around some distant planet, or a two way mission to the Mun - you will either have to learn hours and hours, and hours, and hours, even more hours of youtube tutorials or... cheat.\n\nWhen it comes to tutorials and explaining "how things work in the game we made" the developers failed so miserably, so utterly and completely, that you actually have to wonder which audience they intended this game for?\n\nTelling a new player to try and land a vehicle near space center - is not a tutorial. Forgetting to mention recently added features like heating and cooling, so they would inevitably burn in the atmosphere is a shocking oversight. Not mentioning how to save up fuel when launching vessels, changing orbits or de-orbiting is just lousy.\n\nBottom line is - there is no comprehensive tutorial in this game whatsoever, no learning curve, no actually useful in game tips, tooltips or explanations on anything. Period.\n\nSo before you actually can enjoy this game in its fullest (repetitively launching badly designed pieces of crap is just a part of it) - you will have to spend hours learning how the hell you can launch a vessel properly, save fuel, dock, transfer to another object, land, land in different atmosphere, land without an atmosphere, take off, etc. etc. etc.\n\nI was expecting them to completely revamp the tutorials and the learning curve - they did not. Because of that i was prepared to thumb it down but i could not. Even though developers clearly do not care about players actually getting into their game and enjoying it without wasting a lot of time - modders do care. There are mods that allow cheating, better parts and complete designs which reduce the difficulty curve significantly. There are also plenty of videos (i recommend Scott Manley) which explain various game aspects in details and manage to be both interesting and educational at the same time.\n\nSo yeah... while i am very disappointed in developers, the community and modders made this game better, good enough to recommend it.","May 1, 2015","true","27.9"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","2"

You are your own space program.  Dream it, build it, fly it for better or for worse. You will find yourself wanting to learn the complexities of orbital mechanics. You will find yourself designing larger and more complex things. You will never forget that first time you land on The Mun and live. Then you will discover it's wonderful community.

You are your own space program.  Dream it, build it, fly it for better or for worse. You will find yourself wanting to learn the complexities of orbital mechanics. You will find yourself designing larger and more complex things. You will never forget that first time you land on The Mun and live. Then you will discover it's wonderful community. The devs that listen and interact with it. You will find yourself waiting anxiously for each and every patch with glee knowing that this is still the early days. It is well on it's way to being one of the greatest games ever made and just continues to get better. This will be the 'it' game in due time and in this time of games becoming dumber it is nice to play a game that decides to be complex and  difficult.

It is an indie game and not yet in full release, but the developers are highly communicative with the community and regular updates are released almost always adding major features or bug fixes.  The modding community is extremely dedicated and the developers are highly supportive of it to the point where they have hired several of the best modders straight from the community.\n\nI've put over 250 hours into this game since its been on Steam, but that doesn't count the hundreds of hours I put in before it was on Steam.\n\nThe game is extremely worth it and has an extremely bright future ahead of it.  There is no clear objective system at the moment though, which has turned some people off the game.  I don't believe its coming in the next update but their main priority is currently fleshing out the 'career' mode (as opposed to the sandbox mode that most people play) where there will be objectives, funding, and research.  Research has already been added but it needs some major fixing, which is actually their expressed priority for the coming update.\n\nTLDR; The game is very much worth it, if you're interested in spacetravel at all go for it.  The satisfaction of landing on the Mun (Kerbal equivalent of the Moon) on your own for the first time more than makes it worth the cost, not to mention the hundreds of other things there are for you to do.\n\nOh, and if you're still on the fence there is a free demo for you to try.  It only includes a fraction of the parts and celestial bodies that are available in the full version and does not include the career mode, but it gives you a good idea of what the full game is like.","November 25, 2013","true","509.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is no action here, no twisted plot, no wepons. Different games exploit different human drives. I guess this one exploits you drive of curiosity and learing. Its about exploration and tinkering, experimenting and laughing about the results. And allthough I am not that fond of games without clear purpose at the end, this one makes me come back. Its fun and that's more than enough for me. How about a 3 stage rocket with a Kerbin as a last stage(and then watch how he reenters the athmosphere)? Can you make a Rocket with 6 solid fuel boosters in series fly? Can you reach the Mun? If you find those questions intriguing, then buy it, it will be worth you while.","March 10, 2014","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Meatcookie/recommended/220200/","Meatcookie","meatcookie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Meatcookie/","199 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe only game I have ever played that, when successfully building and launching a rocket to then deploy a lander on the moon followed by an elaborate docking process once back in space led to an ambitious return to the home planet without killing any of my crewmen, gave me a TRUE sense of personal accomplishment that has rivalled real-life accomplishments.\n\nThat may sound lame to some of you who are not hardcore about gaming, while it may sound strange to you hardcore gamers who find accomplishment in successes from other games. I tell you this being a 29-year old gamer veteran of 25 long years (Tandy PC jr., TI Home Computer, Amiga, Commodore 64, and Atari 2600 for starters) who has seen many games come and go. I'm sure that Kerbal may not be a true pioneer of the sandbox sim, yet I have never met a game that has kept me riveted to my PC for as long as this one.\n\nKerbal can create an experience never lived for most of you who grew up wanting either to be an astronaut or a rocket scientist (or both!) and presents it in a fashion that is otherwise unattainable in any other media form. The creation process can be frustrating and unforgiving, between the thrust/mass/control coefficients and the staging management ensuring your success/demise right at the paddock, yet always gives a personal sense of enjoyment when your self-concocted combination of (loosely) held together parts engineered for home plumbing/rocketry when it finally does work out and you break that atmospheric threshold between Kerbin and space.\n\nThe graphics are solid; with a moderate gaming laptop or mediocre desktop PC, this game can still shine. The only time I have run into issues with my Ivy Bridge i7 with 670MX GPU laptop running all features @1080p is when I created a six-part space station with lighting fixtures in low orbit (125 km). This causes some choppy camera effects which can easily be resolved with lowering res or AA.\n\nThe physics are unmatched; the way each rocket adds mass with thrust, providing an unnerving sense of realism to having too much or not enough on either of these factors. This is a mechanism that other space games should take note of.\n\nThe story is unnecessary and therefore (so far) omitted. This is an exploration game with no prome directive. If Squad does finalize the game and provide any type of a campaign, it will only be a plus on an already incredible design.\n\nThe gameplay is certainly something special; you build, launch, stage, deploy, land, and dock to your heart's content! There are also some other great features Squad has done with the R&D facility and science points (it provides a heck of a challenge starting with very little to promote a scientific approach to your exploration and desire for more research). The full solar system exploration will provide countless hours of efforts to send unmanned satellites to the farthest reaches, and perhaps even manned vessels of you are REALLY amibitious.\n\nOverall this game, as it stands, is a 10/10 even though there is still so much left for it to improve on but the foundation of what is the single greatest Early Access Game released on Steam certainly surpasses the expectations I could have ever had of it.","June 26, 2014","true","159.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The majority of your time spent in this game will be just designing rockets that don't blow up on the launch pad.

While modding extends a game's life and increases enjoyment you can easily have fun with the stock unmodified game. I would reccomend Engineer, MechJeb and Kerbal Attachment System to start.\n\nEasy to start.\nYou don't need to know a thing about real world rocketry to play this. There are in-game tutorials for most of the game aspects and the community has written out details about the advanced stuff.\n\n(Mostly) Friendly community.\nWhile every community has its share of "not nice" people, KSP has an invested fan base who will help and support each other. Don't know about a certain thing in the game? You won't be ridiculed for not knowing.\n\nQuicksaving and reverting are enabled.\nAfraid to take some of the Kerbal crew you have grown attached to on a dangerous mission? Have no fear, saves are here! F5 quicksaves the game while F9 reloads the quicksave. Need to take a few tries before you successfully do a powered landing? Just quicksave. Crash terribly before you had the chance to save? Revert to the launchpad. For people who don't like to quicksave it is 100% optional and there are even no in-game checkpoints.\n\nNot stuck to one flight.\nDon't feel like time accelerating while waiting for your deep space probe's course correction? No problem! Just switch to another ship, your probe will still make progress. A mod called "Kerbal Alarm Clock" is great for letting you know when your ships need to be paid attention to.\n\nNASA street cred.\nFor KSP's 23.5 update they actually worked with NASA to add things to the game. While the game isn't 100% realistic you can tell that the developers are balancing realism with unrealistic things.\n\nDemo available.\nMore games should come with a "try before you buy" feature and demos are a great way of giving that. If you are really unsure about if the game is for you, get the demo.\n\nRewarding gameplay.\nKnowing the ship you created landed on the Mun, or even made it into Kerbin orbit, is a great feeling. Being able to bring your crew home safely is also great. I remember my first attempt at a crewed landing on the Mun. I didn't have enough fuel to land on the Mun so I sent an unmanned ship to refuel it using the KAS mod. After refueling I landed on the Mun after several tries. I planted my flag and launched back into orbit only to realize that I didn't have enough fuel to get back so I rendezvoused with the refueling vessel. When I finally made it back to Kerbin and splash downed in the ocean it was a great feeling.\n\n\nCONS:\nNot everyone can pick up and play.\nSome people will not be able to figure out the game and will think it is too complicated. There is online material to help with understanding the game but that might not be enough.\n\n==\nI have spent more time on this game than any other game. I enjoy it that much. More than half my time is spent designing vessels but I am learning more and more. Often I will not have played the game for a few days when I feel it pulling me back in. I definitely recommend this game.","May 30, 2014","true","953.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

So if you're a type to be frustrated when things don't work first time round beware.\n\nHowever, at this point the game has a nice set of tutorials to get you going on the basics and some clearly thought out scenarios which you can use to drop you in situations to practice most other things (without going to the trouble of getting those pesky rockets off the launch pad).\n\nI have found the game to be relatively low on bugs at this point (although rockets do have a tendency to fall apart on the launch pad sometimes). But as the game is still early access it's safe to assume these will be fixed with time.\n\nOverall Kerbal is a Great Game.

This makes ksp a MUST HAVE have for any science nerds out there. And that comes from someone who has only 10 hours, YES that is how quickly this game will draw your attention. There are so few games out there that can deliver the hours of fun and enjoyment that ksp can, and even fewer that deserve your money, but ksp is well worth it! I also highly recommend that you check out some video tutorials on how to actually pilot a ship. Because if you dive right in you are gonna feel pretty lost. Other then that there are very few things that hold this game back from being in your collection.\n\nBUY IT NOW!!!","June 13, 2014","true","13.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Meatcookie/recommended/220200/","Meatcookie","meatcookie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Meatcookie/","199 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe only game I have ever played that, when successfully building and launching a rocket to then deploy a lander on the moon followed by an elaborate docking process once back in space led to an ambitious return to the home planet without killing any of my crewmen, gave me a TRUE sense of personal accomplishment that has rivalled real-life accomplishments.\n\nThat may sound lame to some of you who are not hardcore about gaming, while it may sound strange to you hardcore gamers who find accomplishment in successes from other games. I tell you this being a 29-year old gamer veteran of 25 long years (Tandy PC jr., TI Home Computer, Amiga, Commodore 64, and Atari 2600 for starters) who has seen many games come and go. I'm sure that Kerbal may not be a true pioneer of the sandbox sim, yet I have never met a game that has kept me riveted to my PC for as long as this one.\n\nKerbal can create an experience never lived for most of you who grew up wanting either to be an astronaut or a rocket scientist (or both!) and presents it in a fashion that is otherwise unattainable in any other media form. The creation process can be frustrating and unforgiving, between the thrust/mass/control coefficients and the staging management ensuring your success/demise right at the paddock, yet always gives a personal sense of enjoyment when your self-concocted combination of (loosely) held together parts engineered for home plumbing/rocketry when it finally does work out and you break that atmospheric threshold between Kerbin and space.\n\nThe graphics are solid; with a moderate gaming laptop or mediocre desktop PC, this game can still shine. The only time I have run into issues with my Ivy Bridge i7 with 670MX GPU laptop running all features @1080p is when I created a six-part space station with lighting fixtures in low orbit (125 km). This causes some choppy camera effects which can easily be resolved with lowering res or AA.\n\nThe physics are unmatched; the way each rocket adds mass with thrust, providing an unnerving sense of realism to having too much or not enough on either of these factors. This is a mechanism that other space games should take note of.\n\nThe story is unnecessary and therefore (so far) omitted. This is an exploration game with no prome directive. If Squad does finalize the game and provide any type of a campaign, it will only be a plus on an already incredible design.\n\nThe gameplay is certainly something special; you build, launch, stage, deploy, land, and dock to your heart's content! There are also some other great features Squad has done with the R&D facility and science points (it provides a heck of a challenge starting with very little to promote a scientific approach to your exploration and desire for more research). The full solar system exploration will provide countless hours of efforts to send unmanned satellites to the farthest reaches, and perhaps even manned vessels of you are REALLY amibitious.\n\nOverall this game, as it stands, is a 10/10 even though there is still so much left for it to improve on but the foundation of what is the single greatest Early Access Game released on Steam certainly surpasses the expectations I could have ever had of it.","June 26, 2014","true","159.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is really cool designing your own Rockets and Planes, flying to other planets, docking on your space station and adding new scientific tools or even simply going around the moon on a rover. I would definitely recommend this game as it combines science with fun. This game is extremely realistic in almost all the areas including orbit mechanics and other areas like aerodynamic drag. Some parts are unrealistic like there is no re-entry heat in the regular game but if you go to KerbalSpacePort.com which is created by Kerbal Space Program, you can get many mods which add alot to the game. If you wanted to simulate re-entry, get the deadly re-entry mod and be sure to put Heat Shields on your space ship. If you want more plane parts, get B9 Aerospace. For more rocket parts, I recommend KW Rocketry. You can find a mod for almost everything from new parts to new things you can do like creating a map of the planets with a satellite and then using it to find a cool place to land. This game gets a 5/5 rating from me and since it is only in Beta, I expect more to come since already, this looks like an official game. ~Mountain Lion~","December 6, 2013","true","188.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
