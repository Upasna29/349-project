I do not consider myself a traditional puzzle-platformer player, but the ambience of the visuals and music made this a great game to relax to with a cocktail.\n\nI found the game really fun with interesting hidden goals that made the game progress well.  The soundtrack is really great and you can tell they took a great amount of time to produce some quality tracks.  I also appreciate the fact that the audio track is for sale, I plan on buying it.\n\nOverall, I give it an A.  I do not have a controller so it proved to be a little more difficult for a keyboard interface.  I tried to use my mouse as part of my gaming experience and I had some trouble setting that up, and ultimately failed.  I could have written to the devs on that but I found a groove with the keyboard after some time.","January 31","true","1.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It has been quite the journey.\n\nTo start, the concept is brilliant. The abilities each paint color provides are all unique and interesting. The level design is fantastic, and the difficulty pacing is well done. As soon as you start feeling comfortable, the devs throw another curveball your way. It's always highly rewarding once you finally reach that "Ah-ha!" moment.\n\nThis game is at it's heart raw gameplay. There is no fancy story to tell, and if your wanting some kind of gripping cut scenes or plot twist, this probably isn't that game for you. However, this game is focused on mechanics and aesthetics both of which are beautifully executed. You can tell from the way the character controls that it has been refined over and over again.\n\nLastly there is heart. A lot of games of seen today feel dry. I don't know how to describe it, but when you play this game, you can tell that the devs focused on the details. They cared a lot about what they were making, and they definitely didn't release it before it was ready. I'm stoke that it's finally released!","February 8","true","4.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I enjoy the feel of the character controls sprarying paint with the different crystals is awesome. things to consider\n\n* excellent with Gamepad\n* the feel of the controls as you move your character and spray your paint feels great\n* the music inspires as you play","January 22","true","31.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","1"

Controls are decent too. I just wish there were better explanations of how things work.  Things can get VERY frustrating just because of lack of clear explanations.  Being stuck for 10 mintues becuase lack of clear instructions aren't fun","January 22","false","2.7"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","1"
