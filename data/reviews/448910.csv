It's also hard to find elegant strategy games that are easy to learn and unfold their depth by the combination of relatively straight-forward rules. Axes and Acres delivers on both fronts!\n\nThe game resembles an economic solitaire board game, but uses the digital format to take full advantage of randomization (map, cards, goals, dice) to keep every playthrough fresh. All of the randomness happens before the player is making decisions though and can be mitigated in various ways, so it never feels unfair but more like a set of conditions you have to make the best out of every turn.\n\nOn top of that, the game uses a ranking system to dynamically adjust the difficulty to the player's skill every match. It's a feature far too few single-player games use.\n\nAll in all this is, so far, probably the most interesting game I've played this year.","April 10","true","3.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

My main issue is with the "dice" essentially every dice represents a different type of worker, but you also need to sacrifice them in order to do anything in the game. (For instance in order to cut a tree you place a worker die, sacrifice another die to move, sacrifice another to cut the tree, and then your original worker die will vanish)  To me, it was just hard to visualize, it was like if I have 6 workers why can't I assign them all to a task? Why do I have to sacrifice others in order to perform actions? Why do they disappear after an action is completed?\n- Due to how simplified the graphics are in this game, it's a bit hard to tell what some things are or what you are doing, especially when first starting out.\n\nOverall, I just did not personally find it that enjoyable even though I did take the time to play through part of the tutorial and watch the tutorial video to learn how to play.","April 10","false","7.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

That’s because the surface layer is pretty simple. The old adage holds true – don’t judge a book by its cover and never judge a game solely by its screenshots. Once you dig beneath the surface what you will discover is one of the deepest strategy games to be released in 2016 – indie developer or otherwise. Axes and Acres is a step by step dice and resource management game.\n\nThis is not the type of game that can be judged by its graphics. They don’t need to be any more advanced than what they are. Where the game is to be judged is in its game play. This is a nearly flawless board game. In fact, I was more than a little surprised to find that this wasn’t a board game before the game was launched onto Steam. I can see this being the type of game that strategy buffs could sit at a table and spend countless hours playing. This is the type of game that is designed to be played endlessly (number of rounds or individual games) and it serves that style perfectly yet each round can be played and completed in under an hour. It’s the perfect game for those who are limited to short play sessions as well as players who are wanting to dedicate themselves to a specific game.  Where the game is lacking in graphics the music by Doctor Turtle makes for an inspiring choice for the game.\n\nThe aim of the game is to gain a specified amount of victory points within a predetermined number of turns. You are set tasks to complete in order to obtain these points. For example, you have to create X number of houses, Y number of roads, kill X number of creatures/barbarians, etc. Each game has three phases with an event taking place between phases. I have only played at the lower difficulty levels and so far have only noticed positive events but I am certain that if you were to play at higher levels of difficulty you would find a mix or worse.\n\nWhere most players will have difficulties in absorbing the play is the steep learning curve. The game has a tutorial but even with the explanations and the detailed work going into it the game is still rather difficult to learn. Therefore it may not be as accessible as what I would have hoped for. Players who lose patience or don’t have the time to dedicate to learning the depth of strategy required to be successful in this game will quickly turn away and move onto something else.\n\nIf you’re a fan of strategy games you are going to want to get your hands on Axes and Acres. At under $10 it’s a bargain if you’re ready to commit to it in your gaming schedule.","May 2","true","12.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You manage food, wood, and stone resources to deploy dice, construct buildings and other actions to gain enough Victory Points to win and progress to a harder rank.\n\nCareful management of your resources is needed, and using your dice as a resource is part of the fairly steep learning curve. You start with 6 dice and spend them not only for their face value (building, gathering, working, and reproducing more dice), but also one die to "confirm" each action, and one die to move 2 spaces. You also use cards to perform actions more efficiently to save on dice.\n\nGraphics are clean and well done. Music is relaxing and sound effects sparse in a good way.\n\nRecommended for strategy gamers with patience for the learning curve.\n\nLong Review\n------------------------\nAxes and Acres' menu is very simple. You have some tutorial levels, a teaching video I didn't watch, "Play" mode, and an options menu with some basic sound and display options.\n\n(The tutorial has been improved in V1.01, but I have not tested it yet.)\nV1.00's tutorial may be very confusing and frustrating even for seasoned strategy gamers as myself. I had to restart some tutorial levels several times just to pass them, and I still didn't really get the game's basic mechanics when finished.\n\nThe main mode of the game, "Play" mode, starts you out as rank 1 and will progress you 1-2 levels on a win, and decrease your rank on I believe two losses in a row. This flow is actually very nice, and has kept me playing for hours trying to get better at the game and achieve a higher rank. Maps are procedurally generated.\n\nAxes and Acres is a strategy game with some very concrete, step-by-step thinking involved. Careful management of your resources is needed to succeed, and using your dice as a resource is part of the fairly steep learning curve. You manage food, wood, and stone resources to deploy dice, construct buildings and other actions to gain enough Victory Points to win and progress to a harder rank.\n\nYour objective is to achieve a certain amount of Victory Points (VP) in a certain amount of turns. VP are gained through completing the phase objective on the top of your screen (ex build a road, have 4 houses, hunt an animal, kill a barbarian). Harder ranks require more VP relative to the amount of turns given. Each game has three phases with a VP threshold required to meet phase two and three. When the phase changes, an event happens (positive event on lower difficulties, negative on higher ones) and your three phase objectives change as well.\n\nYou start with 6 dice and spend them not only for their face value (building, gathering, working, and reproducing more dice), but also one die to "confirm" each action, and one die to move 2 spaces. You can't save up extra moves gained this way, though dice left over at the end of your turn do add 1 move to a pool you can use anytime. You also use up to 3 cards a turn to perform actions more efficiently to save on dice. This detailed management may seem tedious to many players, but after playing this fun game a while you will get used to it, and is all part of the strategy and fun of Axes and Acres. :)\n\nThe player starts out a match with just two houses by a river. They must expand their infrastructure over the course of the game to gain enough VP in time. Axes and Acres features 15 buildings that will let your dice navigate the map, collect resources easier, "upgrade" your dice, generate powerful cards to your deck, and more! It takes hours to realize the potential of buildings and their effects.\n\nGraphics are nice and simple, with a large and clean interface. Don't confuse simple with lazy — the graphics are very well done and all fit a cohesive art style. The music is doable, there's two or so acoustic-y tracks that play and serve as some good background music, though about half of the time I like to listen to my own. Sound effects are simple but nicely done, nothing over-the-top or annoying and fit in well with the relaxing atmosphere (minus the stressful thinking involved :P) and minimalist style of the game.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Axes and Acres for those with the time and patience to learn the game. There is great fun to be had for those that enjoy step-by-step thinking and setting both short and long-term goals for a level.","April 12","true","33.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

With static images, I would expect better visuels, but in the end - thats not what the game is about. Its part puzzle, part risk/reward management. Rolling dice each turn to determin your options, then resolving those options in the most efficient way possible. You must keep your food flowing, or you will be unable to do much with your dice, but you also have to think about defense, while at the same time upgrading your dice to gain more control over the random elements.\n\nEach time you win, you play the same game again, but with fewer turns to reach your goal. The path to victory changes a bit each time, as does a few bonuses. The map also changes, but I find this to be of minor importance, as I love building roads.\n\nAfter a few games it gets a bit boring and repetative, but this only lasts a few hours, as I find myself draw back to this simple, yet well crafted game.\n\nThere are so many ways that this game could be expanded, with new challenges, more variety between missions and unique challenges. I hope the devs will look into this, to keep me comming back for another swing with my axe, out there on the acres.","April 12","true","9.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The idea is based around making the best of each situation, using the given tiles on board, the dices you throw each turn and the individual goals for each level. It will award people who are good in planing ahead and are a little creative. Brain-wise I found it pretty demanding. There is an interactive tutorial and a link to a You-Tube video explaining some concepts to get you started. You will still have to do some trial- and error though, but I did like this exploring side of the game, trying to learn the mechanisms by yourself and how things work together.\n\nThe further you will get, the more it will count to make the best out of every single move, as the goals become quickly quite demanding.\n\nThe developer seems to be a nice guy and is interested in feeback, so I'm sure the next update isn't gonna be far.\n\nSome negativ issues as well:\n- I have encounterd once some graphical glitches in the tutorial missions and only there. I was not able to reproduce it. So probably it was some very rare event. I have contacted the developer about it already and he will look into it.\n- It's strictly English only. That might be a problem to some.\n- The music won't set you on fire probably.\n- I can't say if the game will become repetitive after 15-20 hours. Right now it's very exiting and I can't wait to give it another try.\n\nDeutsch:\n\nIch habe bisher nur wenig Zeit mit dem Spiel verbracht, allerdings gefällt es mir bisher, so dass ich mich entschlossen habe eine kleine Empfehlung auszusprechen.\n\nDas Spiel wird sicherlich insbesondere Freunden abstrakter Brettspiele, Puzzelspiele und Solitärspiele zusagen. Es geht im Prinzip darum, aus dem Würfelglück, in Kombination mit den Begebenheiten auf dem Spielplan und den gesetzten Zielen eine individuelle Strategie zu erarbeiten. Gefördert werden die Fähigkeiten Planung und (ein wenig) Kreativität. Nach so einem Level, dampft einem ganz schön der Kopf. Das interaktives Tutorial bereitet einen in drei Stufen auf das Spiel vor, ein You-Tube Video gibt es auch dazu. Danach kann man loslegen, muss aber am Anfang mit einigem an "trial and error" rechnen. Ich selber fand es aber spannend mich mit den Details der Spielmechanik vertraut zu machen und wie alles zusammenspielt.\n\nJe länger ich das Spiel spiele, umso mehr offenbart sich mir die Tiefe des Spiels. Es geht ums optimieren jedes Zuges. Über einzelne Levels wird der Spieler in immer anspruchsvollere Ziele herangeführt.\n\nDer Entwickler ist sehr engagiert und ich bin mir sicher das nächste Update kommt bald.\n\nNegative Aspekte seien auch erwähnt:\n- Im Moment habe ich vereinzelte Grafik-Bugs festgestellt, bei denen die Wüfel auf dem Spielplan nicht richtig dargestellt werden. Allerdings konnte ich es nicht mehr reproduzieren. Kann also sein, dass es eine Ausnahme war. Der Entwickler ist auf jeden Fall informiert und interessiert.\n-EDIT: Bisher stellten sich die Grafik-Bugs nur im Tutorial dar. Im Spiel selber keine Bugs bisher festgestellt.\n- Die Musik ist relativ eintöniges gedudel (zumindest für meinen Geschmack), ich habe schnell die Mute-Taste betätigt.\n- Alles ist auf Englisch, dies mag für manche ein negativ Punkt sein\n- Bisher unklar ist, ob das Spiel nach 10-15 Stunden anfangen könnte sehr repetetiv zu werden. Bisher ist es noch sehr packend.","April 9","true","7.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
