It's simple with simple mechanics yet (similar to Democracy 3) it's really easy to mess everything up. Basically, you have Dilemnas that pop up every turn that require your attention, generally, "give X amount of money for Y." You also have a military which you can move around the various territories in an attempt to quell rebels and bandits but be careful not to overexert yourself. I learned very quickly that doing the right thing wasn't always the best thing for my country and I've had to replay a few scenarios to get it right. I'm actually kind of sad that the game doesn't have more scenarios to play through but for 5 bucks the content is still pretty fun. Plus you'll want to replay just to do better as a President each time. I recommend this for Democracy fans.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QXdMNPYZ8","August 5, 2015","true","3.0"," 60 of 72 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","60","72","9","2"

So it's President for a Day but only Gameplay for an Hour.  But it's a little more than $4 at the time of the sale, so I didn't expect there to be a lot of content itself.\n\nThat being said, time does have a large factor as to why I didn't enjoy myself.  You see the game has a score system that ranks how you did in the little more than a dozen turns you're given, and I felt it actually hurt the game more than it helped it.  Why?  Because at the start you choose which leader you play as, with some buff attributed to them as well as a goal which gives 250 points should you complete it.  To give a comparison, score from other sources (as far as I'm aware from my three scenarios) more often than not amounts to less than a hundred, and I'd guess that's if you do really well in other categories.  With that I feel as though I'm playing Quidditch.  Sure, I -could- do other things to help raise the score up, but ultimately it comes down to that goal.\n\nA lot of people will probably think that it doesn't have any influence on the game itself so I shouldn't complain, and I can't fault them.  That being said there were other problems I had.  If I pandered to a group as hard as possible, if I agreed with everything the rich and the military say, I obtained support in the 60s region, which only provides the first buff, though that is still useful.  I don't even know if there's any buff from raising it higher than that because again, the game length is fairly low.\n\nAnd that's what it comes down to.  This isn't a bad game, it's just a short game that leaves me feeling unsatisfied.  I didn't feel a lot of weight to my actions, but maybe that's the point, life is hard in Africa and there's only so much one man can do to change things up.  Anyway, it's $5 when the sale ends, you might find more enjoyment than I did, and feel it was a worthwhile experience.  But I'd first reccomend getting an emulator to play Hidden Agenda on.\n\n(I encourage people to add comments, either in favor or even if you disagree with me, and if I have any extra tidbits to say about the game I'll probably add it to the comment section so that the review itself isn't a huge wall of text on what I would or would not add to the game)","August 5, 2015","false","0.8"," 46 of 63 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","46","63","5","3"

Short and ocassionally frustrating/unsatisfying, but if you want strategy game with mechanics based on social commentary, consider checking this out.\n\nI think I see what they're trying to do, and it is quite admirable. It's a simple little strategy/resource management game in which you try to lead a non-specific African nation to "victory" (as in, clear the scenario with the highest score). You have several presidents, including the corrupt elite, the military dictator, the Nelson Mandela-esque character, and so on, each of which has a different bonus condition and a different benefit for achieving it, which grants at least the appearance of replayability.\n\nEach turn, you have to move your engineers and armies around, dealing with events and crises as they come up. An in-game news feed will hint at the larger events that you'll have to deal with, but you'll usually have to deal with things as they come (although repeated playthroughs reveal a certain consistency with events).\n\nIf I am correct, the thing that distinguishes PFAD: C is how it tries to convey the really crappy situation that many African nations have had to deal with in modern times through its game mechanics. For example, foreign powers are the absolute worst. Seriously. !@#$ the West.\n\nIn many respects, this frustration is a good thing. However, the game doesn't quite click in the way you'd hope something that dealt with this subject matter would. It's also quite short, with four scenarios, and it might not hold your interest long enough to figure out how to "beat" them all with the best outcome.\n\nWhile I'm definitely mixed on the execution, it is interesting enough to warrant a recommendation in my eyes. It might not satisfy, but if you approach it with an awareness of the subject matter, it might actually get you thinking in ways you wouldn't otherwise expect.","August 29, 2015","true","4.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"

The game reminds me of Tropico & 3rd Millenium. It's rather a fast paced game if i don't care to read all the texts included. Though it has only 4 scenarios to choose from the own decisions dictate the further ongoings, which increases the game's replayability. I have fun playing this game especially because the scenarios go for only 13 up to 16 turns. & i like it also that it's not placed in a fantasy world but relates to reality. There is one negative point, i have to use my mouse to navigate because the game doesn't react to the navigation with the Wacom Pen i usually use. I would also prefer if the game would be less text based & use instead pictures to illustrate the happenings, because the rather coarse design is quite appealing.","August 6, 2015","true","8.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The setup gives some variation but not a huge lot. The challenge I guess is in tackling situations with an unorthadox approach\n\n\nSlightly naieve but only marginly offensive in the way it addresses the issues of exploitation and corruption in Africa I kind of like the way they go for the charicature but it feels like so much low hanging fruit. I guess it gains some points for choosing an interesting setting and getting the tone more or less right, more thought provoking than some games certainly.\n\nFor a couple of Dollars, Pounds or Euros it's probably worth it if you're looking for something to kill lots of little chunks of time.
