There are hundreds of things to learn. The game is divided into different game modes (like Warfare, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Duel, Capture The Flag, Vehicle Capture The Flag, ...), and the community is constantly creating new mutators and new maps, so it never gets boring.\n\nUT3 is a very fast paced thrilling game and you have special movements like dodging and wall dodging which are hard to master but it makes you moving even quicker and much harder to hit. It doesn't matter how tired you are before the game: As soon you're in the game you feel like on adrenaline with eyes wide open and an alert mind. You will hardly experience a boring moment. So if you are looking for a comfy boring game to call it a day and make yourself ready for sleep --- then you are completely wrong with UT3. In the first few weeks UT3 felt kind of ridiculous fast.\n\nHowever, after a while my brain adapted and I got used it. Since then, whenever I try to play another shooter  the new shooter feels slow like sneaking and without dodge and wall dodge movement like beeing an immobile target.\n\nIn other words: It takes you a while to get accustomed with UT3. But once you mastered it you are like edicted and it's hard to go back playing other shooters.\n\nI've played it more than 10.000 hours, first without Steam, now with Steam, still playing almost every day\n\nPlease recommend my review if it gave you an impression of the game","December 22, 2013","true","909.8"," 121 of 129 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","121","129","3","21"

If you've played the older versions, check out my observations:\n\nPros:\n- Very balanced vehicles. Now manta is not immortal and scorpion and hellbender are formidable rather than useless.\n- Hoverboards. Being able to get a speed boost is one of the greatest additions to UT.\n- Orbs for Warfare (Onslaught). These allow lots of strategic defense/offense in Warfare.\n- Characters move with more gravity. I know this is subjective, but honestly I prefer the feel of the UT3 controls to the previous ones.\n\nCons:\n- Campaign story is not really finished.\n- No Assault.\n\nTLDR: If this had Assault, it would be the best UT game out there.

That's the Vehicle Capture-The-Flag gamemode.\n\nIt is the perfect combination of teamwork and individual skill. There needs to be someone who can snatch the enemies flag and move it effectively while being gimped (Flag carriers cannot use vehicles). The rest of the team needs to simultaneously support the carrier as well as protect their own flag.\n\nAll of this is made more complex by a diverse array of vehicles and this is further complicated by the fact that one team may not have the same vehicles available to them as the opposition. And somehow the game maintains balance! It is an incredible feat of game and map design.\n\nThis game has other merits worth mentioning. It's still gorgeous after all this time. Soundtrack lives up to the brand. The Godlike AI is still intelligent as hell (aggravatingly so on vanillla CTF).\n\nDefinitely worth your money and the time your minced bits will layer the walls like a grisly fresco.","December 29, 2014","true","119.0"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","39","41","3","0"

Still, all the weapons and gamemodes you know and love are there (except for Assault, which is disappointing).\n\nGood luck finding a active server, though; everyone else has already flocked off to play the upcoming UT alpha (which I recommend you try out, by the way), and what's left of the game's community has less life than a Necris assassin.","August 8, 2015","true","109.8"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","35","39","7","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/13210/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on August 21, 2009\n\nUnreal Tournament 3 was an easy purchase after the incredible UT2004, at least for me. It promised more of the same awesome gameplay with a brand new engine that looks gorgeous. For the most part, UT3 lives up to the brand name, despite some minor quibbles.\n\nVisually speaking, the game is phenomenal, with an engine that may not be so new as of 2009, but still looks absolutely great. it really shines in UT3's very meticulously crafted beautiful maps, which is where you can see the full potential of the engine. The lighting and particle effects especially are very pretty, from and artistic standpoint, and they stay true to UT's unique art design and feel. I have no complaints on this front.\n\nThe sound effects in the game are for the most part quite good, with the timeless beacons of success like "monster kill!" and "dominating!" making a glorious return. The macho voice acting is of course completely over the top, but this is really to be expected, and as far as I'm concerned, it comes with the territory.\n\nThe gameplay is good, for the most part. DM, TDM, CTF, and every combination of vehicles in battlefield style flag capping and vehicle CTF make an appearance, along with a few more bizarre game modes, and of course good old fashioned duel. There are a plethora of maps, character models, and mutators to suit your particular fancy, and the weapons look, sound, and feel really satisfying and true to the series, with the rocket launcher and flak cannon making particularly gruesome returns. Puzzling, however, is the lack of objective based attack and defend game modes like in UT2004, which saw sides attacking objectives and progressing ultimately towards a final target with a time limit, and then teams would switch sides and try to do better. But wait, you say, UT3 has exactly that in the form of warfare. This is technically true, but UT2004 had some very map specific objectives in very creative scenarios that as far as I can tell are missing from UT3. Where is the space station assault mission? or the tram attack? Oh well, minor quibbles, all in all the gameplay is quite good.\n\nAs far as bang for your buck, UT3 is quite impressive, with 40 plus hours of gameplay at least, and theoretically much more. While the campaign isn't to interesting, these games have never been about single player, although the bots are quite adept if you choose that route. With the new Titan pack and the possibility of more free content, UT3 will last me a for a long time to come.\n\nI can heartily recommend it as a purchase well worth the investment to any fan of shooters, especially those from an older generation, or previous fans of the series.","December 31, 2013","true","19.0"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","0"

Graphics and sounds are amazing as always, gameplay is quick and engaging, there are a lot of interesting and varied weapons, vehicles and maps. However, when compared to the older games in the series it doesn't seem to be the best. When it comes to Warfare/Onslaught (same mode, differently called in UT3 and UT2004), then UT2004 seems to be the best as the gameplay is better thought-through and generally maps seem to be better too. It also feels like the developers went too far with vehicles in this mode in UT3, and in consequence there is just too many kinds of them where some don't even seem very useful. When it comes to Deathmatch/Team Deathmatch or Capture the Flag, then the first Unreal Tournament still remains the best up to this day, in my opinion. It has the most solid gameplay in DM/TDM/CtF and no other game in the series ever came close to it.\n\nDo I recommend UT3? Sure, it's a great game in itself, however, even more I would recommend the first UT or UT2004 (depending on what game modes you want to play). Still, even if you own the older games in the series you still might want to get UT3 on a sale just to check it out, at least to play on some different maps than you usually do.","May 3","true","21.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","1"

The community however is dead, it's literally like 20 people spread out over 10k servers at peak hours. Which is crazy considering this is so much better than 2k4 on basically every single level. The perfect example of a game that should have got more love than it did but just didn't. What's worse now is that the creators are going to aim for more of a 2k4 experience  with UT4 when they should be aiming for more of a UT3 experience because they actually got it right. The player base is just clearly mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for not switching over to the blatantly superior game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/13210/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","UT3 by Epic Games is the fourth game in the Unreal Tournament series and the eigth Unreal game. It runs on their Unreal 3 engine (hence the name) and it looks stunning. The gameplay is tight, the graphics are beautiful and the physics and particle (and gore) effects are amazing. Even though it's five years old the graphics can be tweaked to insane amounts and although it runs at a good framerate on my mid-range hardware if I were to max this baby out it would really push my system to the limits. If you're a fan of Unreal Tournament you'll probably enjoy this game for what it is but it does a few things differently than its predecessors that may annoy you. For one, UT3 focuses heavily on vehicle based combat. Now, I'm a big UT'99 fan and I felt it was possibly the most pure shooter experience I've ever had the joy of playing and it didn't need gimicks like fancy ships, hoverboards (seriously, you get a hoverboard to fly around on on bigger maps), and giant maps to be a great arena shooter. All you needed was running, and gunning. Now, that's not saying that UT3 lacks this, it certainly has smaller maps without hoverboards where you fly around and blast people to bloody bits just like the older games but it does have new mechanics you may like or dislike, such as the ability to "play dead" and fall down, which I found to be distracting, and a handy floating arrow that shows you where to go in CTF and Warfare modes (it's not obtrusive, trust me). The level design is also incredibly well done, with fun things to play with like different physics and rainfall and hazards and difficult to reach powerups. Unfortunately, this game lacks the assault game type which I found to be a lot of fun in UT'99, and the emphasis that UT3 places on the Warfare gametype during the campaign I found to be draining as the maps were just too large. I felt like I was playing Battlefield or something, with everyone flying or driving something accross a huge distance to complete some type of objective. But I digress. Basically what I'm trying to say that although this game has its merits and can stand on them, it's not as good or as fun to play as the games that preceeded it. It's a lot of fun and is good for LAN and online play and even though the graphics are amazing I think I'd still rather play UT'99. Your mileage may vary, however, and I'd still recommend this game as it's a fun shooter and is a member of a series that I think is at the front of the pack in the arena combat scene. Oh, and it comes with the UDK and Unreal Tournament 3 Editor and has great MOD support, so there's hours of fun outside of what comes in the box.\n\nPros:\n\nStunning Visuals\nTight Gameplay\nGreat Music/Audio\nMOD Support\nHas the Sniper Rifle! (Lightning Gun sucks.)\n\nCons:\n\nA lot of focus on vehicular combat\nSome detrimental changes to UT gameplay and styling\nGame felt more like a showroom for the Unreal 3 engine than a UT series game\nNo Assault game type\nSo-So Controller Support (I don't know what the "E" button is on my control pad)\n\nIt's hard to enhance on near perfection and any changes you make to a beloved series is going to have some fallout and I appreciate the effort here. It wasn't a colossal failure like Diablo 3 was but it just didn't wow me like the previous UT games did. It was fun and it wasn't bad but if I'm playing some UT Deathmatch I'm probably not playing this game over the others. I'd say give it a shot and play it to see if it's your thing because the larger maps and new focus on vehicular combat may be something you enjoy a lot. Oh yeah, there also was a story (it didn't focus on the "tournament" though). I didn't really talk about it as it's not super important in a UT game but it was mediocre and had some cool moments. Good effort team, it certainly didn't detract anything from the game, I just didn't really care about it much. TL;DR nothing gets your heart pumping like Unreal Tournament - although it's not my favorite of the series it scratched an itch that hadn't been touched in years.

The good old classic UT99GOTY later was UT2003 then UT2004. In this edition some features were removed that existed in the older UT series like Assault, which was very popular and interesting game type. However there was an improved on the Onslaught game type idea that was introduced in UT2004 and transformed it to game type called Warfare in UT3, also added some sort of single player campaign which is not too bad, the single player campaign was also available in the old UT99GOTY but was presented in a more simplistic manner.\n\nThe downfalls are that the game isn’t supported much by modding community anymore especially if you compare it to the old UT99GOTY.  The other thing is lack of players. However, you can still make your own server and play with bots or have a LAN party with friends. If to speak about UT3 Black Edition as a whole is defiantly something worth trying.\n\nI personally would recommend any UT series to try, because this is not a game it’s a legend!","December 29, 2010","true","490.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a sort of back-to-basics approach in the weapon selection and non-vehicle game modes, and the vehicles themselves are actually well-implemented and fun to play with. The maps are well designed, the gameplay's definitely still Unreal Tournament, and the graphics are outstanding (especially considering the great performance!). Only major problem is the singleplayer campaign, which replaced the Tournament with a war... in other words, the campaign's simply stupid.

In short near dead community.its so dead, the  ps3 version (before online shutdown of gamespy) had more life  than this game today. hell UT2004 today even has more of community than UT3. So today, this game can now only fall back on single player which even back then i didn't really like. found it pretty boring. Even at occasional sale price of $10 its not worth it. If you could get as cheap like i did($3) go for it, you can occasionally find online matches and could mess around with bot matches. But for $10 price range you can find games on steam with lot more content than this game nowadays.

Unreal Tournament is a master of both!\n\nThe guns are balanced in a way that they are not overpowered in any way (Especially with the no super weapons mutator). A highly skilled player could easily take someone out with a better gun if they lack in skill.\n\nGamemode wise there is a variety of fun modes for everyone from the big Warfare where you destroy the other teams nodes and that includes vehicles from classics such as CTF to my personal favorite betrayal. It is mainly betrayal that makes this game stand out for me above the older unreal games (UT2004 has a Betrayal mod by the community if your intrested). It is a (T)DM hybrid with InstaGib (1HitKill) weapons. You frag others to gain points and also raise the team pot. Kill your oponent to still this pot and he has a limited time to get back to you. This brings for very fun balanced and also pleasently frustrating moments.","July 4, 2011","true","47.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Avoid Skaa3w models, because they're pretty bad ports that have horrible readmes and look like they're slathered in crisco. The Aviana and Demonus models are really high quality, although they don't match the game's visual style much. The Community Bonus content is alright. Classic Maps Megapack is a must--lots of them are better than the default maps.

Are you looking for some adrenaline and can't wait for the cutscenes and all the story of the game show up until you can finally shoot some heads off? That's your game mode then!\n\nThe Bots are really fast if you want it. Very smart if you want it. They make you feel like a little baby trying to play the game if you want it! But they can be very stupid if you want it too. [There's a big variety of configurations that you can apply to the game before entering the action.]\n\nThe graphics are very good. Not to argue about. And looks pretty modern even after so many years.\n\nSound effects and music not so addictive like the UT99 ones, but close enough to make you feel fine.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\nThe Campaign looks boring if you don't like some of the game modes. But you can always go to the Instant Action mode. It gives the game the replay factor that every FPS should give.\n\nThe Multiplayer mode is dead. (It's not because there are no people playing this game anymore, but Epic Games just has unplugged the servers after years and years of service. There are a mod somewhere that allows you to play in that mode if you want to search for it) But back in time, when you could play this mode, the number of custom servers with tons of custom maps and mods to download were so big that the wait until all the stuff to be downloaded and you finally enter the server was so absurd that you were disencouraged to play there anyway.\n\nIt's a game that came out before the Steam, so there are more players with versions of the game out of here than the Steam players (but if you really want to play with friends in multiplayer mode, the mod that allow this, allows you to enjoy the game with all the people around the world too ;) )\n\n9/10","November 9, 2011","true","43.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rajada_nab/recommended/13210/","rajada_nab","Xmus Jaxon Flaxon-Waxon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rajada_nab/","148 products in account","Unreal Tournament 3 is a game in a very awkward position. On one hand, if you're a fan of the series, this game has probably stripped out some of your favorite features. On the other hand, if this is your first experience with an Unreal Tournament game, you might not immediately feel like UT3 is your kind of shooter. If you've never played an Unreal Tournament game, and you're looking for a fast-paced, competitive, well thought out, arena based shooter, this might be just the game for you. But, as many other reviews have shown, if you've played previous Unreal Tournament games, it might take some getting used to.\n\nUT3 is by no means the worst game ever made on the Unreal engine. Most fans of previous Unreal Tournament games are more than likely going to be a little disappointed with this sequel, most of them claiming the game was "dumbed down" or a "console port" and it is hard not to agree with them. However, just because it isn't what you expected doesn't mean you can't enjoy it.\n\nLet's start off by saying that while there is really no justification to buy a game based on aesthetics alone, UT3 is really pretty.  Fans will say the graphics have been turned murky and brown, but the life and personality of previous Unreal games is very apparent in the visuals. Other shooter franchises don't put the kind of attention to detail into their levels that Unreal developers do. Every level has its own mood and unspoken narrative that make them a joy to just run around in.\n\nAs far as other non-gameplay features are concerned, the soundtrack is yet another standout. The music in game is crafted in specific mood-setting parts that lend to the feel of the match at the time. When the game thinks it appropriate, it will switch up to another part of the song nearly seamlessly. So when you're capturing an enemy flag and the music turns into a more intense version of itself, you can actually notice the effect it has on your gameplay, raising your adrenaline and pushing you to perform as good as the music sounds right now.\n\nOn a macroscopic level, the formula for gameplay is relatively untouched from previous UT games. You pick up scattered weapons and powerups, you out-dodge and use your skills to snag big kill streaks, and when you inevitably die, you respawn in no more than 3 seconds, ready to jump right back in and do it again. If you were a fan of UT 2004's Onslaught mode, you'll be happy to know that it is back in a very polished form. The design of the vehicles within this mode is pretty stunning, and each one is very enjoyable to use. The same goes for every weapon. Since players have enough health to counter-attack, kills are satisfying and feel like an accomplishment in most cases, instead of a cheap shot on an enemy with no time to react.\n\nBut, going a little deeper, fans will find that a few major gametypes have been lost in translation, including the very popular Assault gametype, in which players attack and defend a base with a linear string of objectives. Perhaps the developers thought that the new base warfare mode was too similar, and Assault was scrapped because of this. But you really shouldn't blow the game off just yet.\n\nAnother odd feature is the frankly bizarre handling of campaign mode. Instead of the standard UT match-up ladder, the designers opted to make the campaign story based. Essentially, you fight a team of bots in a standard gametype, but there are story reasons for them. For example, you might be fighting in a deathmatch against a rival faction's mercenaries in an attempt to "drain their respawners". It feels very superficial to attempt to explain a tournament style game with a Gears of War style plot. Frankly, if you can ignore the plot, you'll likely enjoy the game more.\n\nEpic dropped the ball a little on supporting coop campaign mode. You have to restart Steam every time you or a friend playing with you quits campaign mode, which is more than a bit annoying. But as I soon discovered, playing through coop campaign mode with 2 or 3 friends against difficult bots is a total blast and a huge adrenaline pumping experience when your success as a team comes down to executing a plan between you perfectly. Every minor victory becomes a huge high when you were an essential part of it. This is the kind of feeling you just don't find often in coop shooters.\n\nSo in the end, UT3 is a different kind of Unreal Tournament game. It was made to have mainstream console appeal, but it hasn't lost all which made its predecessors great. If you can ignore the frankly silly plot, overlook the minor missing features from previous games, and not get red in the face screaming about how much the main character looks like Marcus Fenix (and trust me, he does), then there is still a lot of fun to be had with UT3. My recommendation, buy a bundle of UT games during a sale and try to get the whole series, because you will likely pull hours of enjoyment from each and every one.","April 25, 2014","true","55.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's always a good time, and you can't go wrong. My first PC build was to get better graphics from this game, and it still looks great today IMO. There are many mods and maps, and I've even made some maps with the toolkit which makes it an even better experience. I wasn't really excited about the story aspect, at first. Traditionally the Unreal series is a story game like unreal, or unreal 2, and in between those the Unreal Tournament games. There wasn't any tournament in UTIII, but it still stands out as one of my all time favorite games. All modern FPS owe their lives to the Unreal series, and if you haven't experienced them you should. I would recommend buying the Unreal Deal and playing Unreal, UT99, Unreal 2, UT2004, Then UT III.","November 1, 2014","true","10.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Given how often I played offline with bots, I'd believe that.\n\nUnfortunately, UT3 introduces a laughably stupid singleplayer campaign that is more repetitive than it is fun or interesting. By trying to make a legitimate "story mode" for the game, they've sort of spoiled the fun of the original, because there's a lot of story stuff that gets in the way. There's still ways to do regular bot skirmishes, though, so it's not such a big problem.\n\nWhat is a big problem is that it's just not especially fun to play. The smaller maps feel too cramped and the larger maps get to be a little too large. Onslaught mode from UT2004 has been remade here as a retooled "Warfare" mode, and it's been changed for the worst. Players can now carry an orb around that lets them capture control points instantly without waiting, but instead of speeding the game up, all it does is make long, drawn out, tedious stalemates the norm, as teams fight over one or two nodes and instantly revert any progress made by the opposing team, over and over and over again. I've had Warfare matches go on for hours without much progress from either side, and enabling a time limit for rounds does little to alleviate the issue, as sudden death doesn't really mean anything when neither team's core is ever exposed.\n\nPlus, the guns just don't feel good. They feel meaty, sure, but something about them is... "off" in a way that's hard to describe.\n\nAll this really made me do was re-install UT2004 and play that instead.","June 2, 2014","false","9.5"," 37 of 73 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","37","73","0","1"

Hmm what to say, what to say... Most of the fans were for strange reasons disappointed of this game. But in my sight (That just for some reason is in love of underated stuffs,) I enjoy this game.\n\n'Tis sad it got a low amount of users playing online, but in there the game is quite intense, unlike with bots. And by the way: Speaking of bots, some of them may be strangely made. Especially in Campaign, which is mostly just made out of low-skilled bots with the constant 'warfare' mode. And this review will be mostly, based on that.\n\n---\n\nUnlike the single players of the previous Unreal Tournament games, there is a special story in it, with (I think) the whole campaign being played with you and your teammates, bots, in missions. There are no actual tournaments and this feeling of arena that was from previous games, but constant war. Without any spoilers, I will just describe the game inside it;\n\nFrom the start you play on with flags with your small team and the enemy team, that actually know how to use 'translocators' pretty well. But of course, too novice. Sadly the whole continuity of the single player is made out of novice bots. Even your teammates achieve no skill in progress, seriously. Only enemies get to...evolve. But by a little bit. I was disappointed that the parody-race of Skaarj were not as monstrous as they looked.\nThe gameplay itself with the story goes on solid. Through the missions with flags you then get to complete them in more complex maps, then to the cores with vehicles and prime nodes, and so on for a long time. Sometimes you may get an extra mission, however. It is truly a good feeling when you get back to the deathmatches from these time-consuming warfares.\nAnd later of the game, of course, gets strangely hard. I say strangely because even your epic skills in gaming may not always help your stubborn teammates that cannot even protect the nodes correctly. But thankfully, you got a fuction close to the 'Taunt' and 'Status' section called 'Orders,' since you are a leader and all. It does benefit you a little. Most of the time just do 'Defend' for all the teammates not to get molested by the incoming horde of smarter attacking bots.\n\nBut overall...I played this campaign when my internet was out. For some reason I was just, entertained by it. Even with slightly funny way of this game being made, I was digged in a little. Because of my boredom and because of my love to the look of this game, and the whole love to the UT series. Not to look at the negatives of the game, when you imagine it all, more lively of a game, like a movie, it is enjoyable.

The gameplay is straight forward, and all weapons are easy to use.\n\nThe art style matches the gameplay, as a super action sci-fi style movie setting. Any other setting for it is stupid. The characters are joking and colorful... most of them, anyway. Bishop's lines are the best. So if you're that kind of person who pays attention to atmosphere, it doesn't fail here.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, imagine the gunplay of Quake combined with the vehicles of Halo. Nothing much to say here. There are basic Source-inspired movement techniques, such as jumping with weapons and bunny hopping. There are many ways to play, but I categorize them based off their representatives from the Campaign. For example, as I'm used to games where headshots are important, I would be Bishop. Vehicles are of the standard selection: buggies, hover planes, tanks, and a heavier buggy. However, all these vehicles differ from their standard Halo inspirations. For example, the buggy has fold-out blades on the front bumper. Yeah. There are no overpowered weapons or vehicles, but I have to say that the Bio Rifle does a bit too much damage for a gun found right outside of spawn.\n\nThe creator tool is a creator tool using the same engine as the game. Not much to say.\n\nTL;DR, It's a good arena game that tops even Half-Life 2 Deathmatch. Gameplay is fluid, art style actually makes sense, so get it if you don't suck at shooters.\n\nEDIT: The Free To Play Unreal Tournament currently outclasses this game in the modes it has, however, it doesn't have vehicles or hoverboards yet. Also no Warfare. So get this if you need to catch up on the series or are extremely impatient.","May 4, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I could rattle on about it, so instead, here's a list of rpos and cons:\n\nPros\n-- Game pace is fast and brilliant\n-- The AI (bots) are well programmed but, as usual, teamwork is a lot harder (if not impossible) with bots, so sometimes you have to work around them to get something done. This isn't always a bad thing because it can make the game very interesting.\n-- The variety of weapons is good and, in my experience, aren't quite as easy to learn to use well as you might expect. This is not CoD, so becoming proficient with a weapon actually takes practice.\n-- The vehicles are fun and well done. The only one I have a problem with is the tank because if you have someone with have a brain operating the turrent, you really do need your whole team to be able to kill it. But this is probably me being too picky.\n--The way all the elements of the game fit together forms a game which is truely amazing.\n\n\nCons\n-- Even though there is a story, playing the maps (at least the first few) doesn't really make it feel like there is. All the objectives I've played so far are all TDM, CTF, CTF with vehicles, etc and it doesn't feel very story-like.\n-- It may be the comuter me and my mates have, it might not, but we did run into a few issues when joining each others games on lane. But we'd still be able to join 6 or 7 times out of 10, so it's not enough to be bothered by, but enough to annoy you a little.\n\nOther Comments\n-- This game is very reminiscent of Gears of War in the way things look. This is neither a pro nor con, but is cool if you loved and played any of the Gears of War franchise.\n\nOverall, this game is bloody amazing and would highly recommend!\nMy score : 8/10","August 1, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

They also didn't include the beloved "Assault" game mode.\n\nThe campaign's story is remarkably boring, and the worst part is they force you to play the ridiculous "Onslaught" levels which is a gimmicky mode in the first place, and the bot's AI is completely unreliable, making it almost impossible for me to progress on higher difficulties simply because my bots were not doing their jobs.\n\nIn the original Unreal Tournament, playing the single player was fun because you could choose whichever game mode you felt like playing and work your way up the ladder, getting familiar with every single level so when you go online you're ready. There is a sense of completion as you go for nothing more than tournament glory. But in Unreal Tournament III you have to slog through a terrible and cliche story that isn't related to any tournament at all and you aren't given any choice which modes you want to train in.\n\nEven more frustrating is that the online mode is almost entirely unsupported. You have no stats, no functional matchmaking, and it's impossible to get you and your friends into the same game. They completely dropped the ball here.\n\nOther than that, the original core game is actually really fun. It's got that dark gritty Unreal feel, and it's super-gory so it's really satisfying when you get a kill. The best game mode is Deathmatch because it's the only one that actually represents what the game is supposed to be about in the first place: gladiatorial arena killing. But instead of adding the "Assault" game mode or supporting the "Team Deathmatch" and "Capture The Flag" modes with functional match-making, they did nothing here and just kept the "Onslaught" mode with the ridiculous vehicle combat that doesn't even feel like a tournament fighter anymore. It's just some vehicle gimmick they added ever since Halo came out.\n\nJust skip this one. The original Unreal Tournament is better in every single way except for the graphics, which are the only good thing I can say about this game. Don't get me wrong -- it's extremely fun to play for ten or fifteen minutes if you just want to kill some bots when you're bored, but beyond that I can say with confidence that this game offers nothing else worthwhile.","November 25, 2013","false","9.1"," 28 of 56 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","28","56","0","2"

That's strictly my opinion, though. I don't knock GOW, because it is a good franchise, but....\nbut...\nSome have waited 9 years for another installment in this franchise. I myself, playing UT99 for the first time a year ago, can now roll with some of the people who haven't seen the light in fifteen years because they've been in their basement playing this game. Okay, I'm not a pro, but that doesn't stop me from wanting another one of these games. Not a whole lot of people play this game anymore… but that doesn’t stop it from being a great game.\nUnless the Halo games are rereleased for PC, this is probably what I'll be waiting for.\nTry turning the safety off.\n","March 18","true","17.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The game and software is very good but the online multiplayer as I remember had too long of wait times between tournaments, there was this never ending need to wait and reaffirm stuff and there was the repeating requests to join in again. That killed the spirit and killed the fun. Don't do that again Unreal! I hope the next Unreal does away with that rubbish and returns to the elements that made Unreal so successful and have such a massively huge and dedicated following online for multiplayer, mapping and modding. The game is awesome, the software stable and the online multiplayer worked great but that nagging and waiting killed all of it. Great game though and when you finally do get into a online multiplayer and have the patience to stay there through the constant waits and requests to rejoin you'll see the game and graphics are sweet as can be :)","May 16, 2014","true","36.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I didnt get really into it untill UT3 came out. It is by far my favorite, not just because it is easier that its predecessors. The maps have expanded so much, and the user interface for the game has come a long way. The game missions as well as multiplayer remains capture the flag, and deathmatch/team deathmatch centered. They have also integrated new gamemodes which are refreshingly challenging. While the weapons have stayed the same name wise, they've gotten technologically better. Legendary guns like the Flak Cannon, still pack a punch, but look way more futuristic and alien like. I cant say as to wether a lot of people will feel the same about it as I do. It is a first person shooter, but the alien technology isnt for everyone. I've always described it similar to halo, but better in my opinion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kittttttty/recommended/13210/","kittttttty","May","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kittttttty/","542 products in account","Funny thing: I bought this game way back near to the time it came out, as I was super hyped for it. Unreal Tournament has always been my favourite FPS series. Anyway, I got my copy as the regular edition of the game from a retail store. I never bothered registering the key on Steam until years later, as I think I tried it once, and, it didn't work. Then I tried it again, and... it did. Not only that, it gave me the Black Edition. I'm okay with this.\n\nAnyway. The game itself is pretty good. It's like a shinier, prettier UT 2004. I... don't really like it that much. The guns just feel all wrong. It's not a BAD game by anyone's standards. UT3 (which is a very stupid, VERY very stupid title, I mean, it's not the third Unreal game, it's not the third Unreal Tournament game, where did they get the number 3 from... just wtf) is a fantastic game in fact. It's just that I think UT 2004 is a bit better. UT3 doesn't really have many issues I don't think. It just doesn't feel right.\n\nPick it up on sale, I guess, if you're really devoted to the series. I'm not sure the multiplayer isn't dead.\n\nAlso, to address the title situation in more detail... lets see here. Unreal, then Unreal Tournament, then Unreal Tournament 2003, then Unreal II: The Awakening, then Unreal Tournament 2004, then Unreal Tournament 3.\n\nSo... where do they get the 3 from? The third Unreal Tournament game was 2004. If it were Unreal 3, that would make it the third Unreal game. But it's not called that. It's called Unreal Tournament 3. What were they thinking? Seriously, I guess the fact this game actually has a campaign of sorts makes it a bit more of an Unreal 3, but at the same time... what?\n\nIn Unreal, you're a prisoner who ends up crashed on a planet, you escape the dead vessel, and then you go out into the world to find a way off the planet, and in the process, rack up an insanely huge body count, tear through an alien temple, and destroy the mother of an evil alien race. Among other things. It's awesome, and crazy.\n\nIn Unreal 2, you're a space marshal guy who does objective based missions in space. I don't really have much more to say about it. You hang out with your spaceship pals, learn some tragic pasts, get a whole pile of awesome guns, and massacre hundreds of mercs and aliens. Great stuff.\n\nThen... what, you're telling me this is meant to be Unreal 3? Is it? Maybe it is. The campaign feels tacked on, and as is usual with the Unreal Tournament series, it's still basically just Unreal Tournament matches, but the game puts tidbits of story in with things so it feels like an actual game.\n\nThis ended up taking like half the review, but, hey, it needs to be asked, why? Is this Unreal 3, or Unreal Tournament 4? It can't be 3, that was done already. There wasn't even an Unreal Tournament 2, if you're not counting the two yearly games, 2003 and 2004. Which would make this Unreal Tournament 2. But that's nonsensical. I just don't see where they got 3 from. On top of this, Epic Games DID have a hand in all three of the previous games... I don't get it.\n\nBut yeah, get Unreal Tournament... uh... 3. It's good!","December 7, 2015","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you've played the previous installments of UT and then decided to look at some reviews for it, HEAD MY WARNINGS. This is nothing like the previous installments just because it slaps a sticker that says that "I'm legit! Buy Me!"\n\nFirstly, the game itself is a selling point. If you've played the series before and wanted something to look back to, this is not something you want. This is the rejected siamese brother to what this series is based on. Sure it has shooty shooty bang bang, but it also has a story that nobody really asked for... I don't see why this was necessary in the first place but whatever. It isn't really that good either. They looked like they were trying to go for something mixed between the Hot Wheels Acceleracers 'Big Foot' thing and CoD.\n\nSecondly, the weapons were completely revamped and not in the good way. Take my advice, the Flak Cannon shouldn't be used anymore. It's a load of crap. A few of the weapons were just nerfed to make it more "Level for all weapons to deal correct damage". That's not how it was meant to be played, some weapons were DESIGNED to be overkill, like the Flak Cannon or the Rocket Launcher. They decided to nerf them, sure there's blood and gore, but I believe there are mods to revamp damage to "exposive" levels again.\n\nThirdly, the A.I. is bull. Now before you ask specifics, lemme explain. Either your team is as useless if not more than a steamy pile of bile mixed with burnt rubber, or the opposing team is as smart as a rocket scientist to know exactly where you are at all times. This is both good and bad. Good because it shows the A.I. is dedicating itself to taking out the most advanced player (i.e. you) and Bad because, again, your team is just useless. I wouldn't have them on my team anywhere... Not even a science project, lord knows they'd let me down there too. Aside from those points, they're just annoying overall. They now use voice actors to display what they're saying instead of typing or, y'know, shutting up and doing it. It's like they want the enemy to know "HEY! GUESS WHAT?! WE'RE GONNA GO FOR THE EXPLOSVES! JUST LETTING YOU KNOW! OH AND GG MATES!"\n\nFinally, this game was the final game in the series. Disappointing as it may seem, the series took one faulty game and ended up dishing out this undeniable turn of events. Being as it's probably the only real disappointment in the Unreal Tournament series, you'd think they'd have made another one to make up for this error, sadly not. Both a gift and a curse if you think about it in the context of "They won't make another game, but they won't make another craptastic Unreal Tournament".\n\nSo that pretty much sums up all I have to say about this game really.\nTL/DR: This game is like going to see Metallica live in concert and getting falsely advertised into a Justin Bieber marathon with the volume cranked to 11.","January 16","false","20.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","4"

And the crappiest thing is, the INI files are written TODAY so it DOES write them, it KNOWS where the settings are, it just chooses to not save anything. This isn't a misunderstanding, lost permissions or a read only checkbox.\n\nWhat are you doing on Steam, asses? That's why I carry an entire platform on my back, so I don't have to make new accounts on every game, so I don't have to be online to play, and so I can have my progress saved.\n\nWhat were you thinking, not saving my campaign?

Screwed over.\n\nHere's another lovely thing: not only torrented version saves campaign, it's how it saves it that's funny. There are workarounds online in which if you mark the file read only while playing and then exit, it does save.

Warfare (formerly onslaught) has undergone a number of questionable design choices (insta-capture orbs) which altar game flow dramatically. Many of the movement options which made UT2K4 a hit with the competitive scence as well as 'adrenaline' combos (admittedly a controversial addition in the first place) are no longer.\n\nHowever perhaps the most glaring design failure was the direction Epic decided to steer this game. Hot on the heels of Gears of Wars' success and with plenty of unused art assets, Epic tossed out the Tournament canon in favor of an extremely lackluster filler campaign akin to those that ship with the yearly COD releases. Furthermore, many prominent and loved tourney combatants were either removed or attached to an unrecognizable body. Graphically these bodies have been disfigured and hyper-muscularized and the lush arenas of previous titles have been tossed out in favor of the muddy, bloom and postprocessing-heavy urban jungles so characteristic of its generation. It's also worth noting that unlike its namesake, this game came out on console first and shipped to PC with a (since partially fixed) console UI. This disrespect for canon and shoddy presentation make clear one thing: on release, Epic simply valued money over their fan base.\n\nSure, Epic didn't completely abandon the title, to their credit releasing several solid maps, patches and the Titan bonus pack, as well as sponsoring tournaments and the Make Something Unreal contest, but it was still only a band-aid over the aforementioned lacerating flaws of this title. Note that this support (long-since ended) came and went 3-years-ago, the community having dwindled to, at the time of this writing, one-to-three scantly populated servers per game mode (compared to 10-20 near-capacity in UT99/UT2K4).\n\nDid Epic release a few interesting new features for this game? Sure, the hoverboard/grapple is invaluable over larger maps and Warfare's bonus nodes bring variety to the mode; several of the new maps are also well-designed. However, it's a big loss compared to what you are giving up from the previous titles and I'd recommend that if you're into the larger-scale or competitive aspects look into UT2K4, quake-like team-arena modes UT99. Viewed apart from the series, it's a mediocre team-arena shooter with a weak community, and even Tribes: Ascend will serve you better.\n\nANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: If you do own a retail PC copy of UT3, you can save yourself the expense and redeem the key for a free Steam copy.","November 25, 2013","false","10.2"," 17 of 38 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","17","38","0","2"

It completely ruins the mechanics of whittling down a node until it falls, and then rebuild it for your own team. It's all about rushing the orb ASAP.

It's pretty great. Never play campaign, though. The game is online shooter, I don't really know why they included campaign in the first place. Every UT game included one, though.\nSome people argue that UT2004 is better in terms of gameplay, but I believe it's a matter of taste. I have played and enjoyed both games.\n\nThere's large assortiment of maps (both official and community-made, everything for free, no stupid DLCs), characters, and other mods. Some people even find enjoyment in trying various maps and mods with bots offline. As for me, playing offline is largely useless, but YMMV. It's pretty easy to mod the game, though it's the case for other UT games as well.\n\nGraphics is largely outdated, but so many years have passed since the release, and who cares, anyway? What I don't like is the style. It's dark, gloomy and overdetailed. I liked UT2004 more. Community-made HOLP map pack for this game has maps that better suit my taste.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, but so-called dynamic music wasted it, in my opinion. I play with in-game music turned off, but sometimes listen to OST separately.\n\nWhat really ruined the game is lack of developer support. Although several patches were released that had addressed outright bugs (honestly, Valve games like TF2 faced much more disgraceful bugs during their lifetime), Epic Games never seemed to really care about this game. It's hard to tell what's exactly should've done about this, but for some reason TF2 is still alive and well, despite being released roughly at the same time and failing into the same niche of old school shooters.\n\nThere's a lot of small issues that aren't exactly game-breaking, but still prevent from enjoying the game fully. Like fragile replay support (try to play a demo recorded on server with mods on), buggy dedicated server on Linux (and no client whatsoever), frequent issues with GameSpy middleware, technical issues with with custom gametypes (to be precise, cooking map made for custom gametype causes trouble if gametype is ever updated), lack of proper custom crosshair support, inability to switch to spectator from player, and a lot of other problems that were certainly mentioned on Epic Games forums multitude of times.\n\nAs of now, game is almost dead. I do play it occasionally, you can find some players online, but still.

New maps are bad, they took out the best game modes, changes to the old weapons are awful. This has contributed nothing at all to the series. The community is very dead these days, even Unreal 1999 has more players than this does. The new vehicles are pretty stupid and over powered. The combat doesn't feel smooth anymore and the modding community is pretty low and abandoned. They removed 80% of the player models from UT04. The new map editor is horrible and barely usable. If you really want to try this game, think twice. If you want to try the Unreal series, get the original one. 2k4 was okay as well. The only thing they possibly changed in a positive way was the campaign, they tried adding a story which was still a flop and not as good as 2k4. 5.7/10","April 28, 2012","false","17.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Not because I think it's a bad game. It looks good. And I'm sure the UT purists out there hate it for it's lousy Console-to-PC port. I can't say I blame them. But it's definitely not an unplayable game, as far as multiplayer mode goes. The big problem with UT3 is there are no players playing it. So what you're left with is a morsel of servers, with a few players here or there. But no real community behind it. It's a sad thing to see.\nAside from that mess, the singleplayer experience is dreadful. A very boring campaign mode. It's lack luster at best, I always felt the single player modes in the UT series were unnecessary to begin with. I always skip right over them to play the multiplayer game.\n\nAnyways, it's quite unforunate to see what happened to this series. Here's hoping Epic fixes things for UT4.

Actually that's not true; we had a bunch of authentication problems playing UT 3 on a LAN even though we all purchased it.\n\nThe game DOES have a sniper rifle, and does NOT have that stupid ♥♥♥ lightning gun, so that's a huge plus.\n\nThe rocket launcher's alternate fire only fires 3 rockets.  The only weapon with a lamer alt fire is the bio rifle.\n\nThere are some classic maps which cool improvements, like Deck 17 and Facing Worlds.\n\nThe single player campain is incredibly annoying.  Plotwise, they try to sort of invent this unecessary, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ story backwards from deathmatch to explain people dying and respawning all the time.  It seems complately unrelated to the "plot" of UT99.  The worst, though, is that you can't choose to play only deathmatch levels and/or completely ignore certain game modes.\n\nFor multiplayer, they also try to force you onto some lame social media thing (which does not connect to steam) in order to play with other people.  I wish I had known that before buying.  At the last lan party I attended, no one was able to connect this way, so we all opted to play in disconnected/offline mode or whatever they call it.  Unfortunately when you do that, there is no UI for changing your name; you have to open the console and type something every single time you join.  Also, so far, I haven't found a way to save your single player progress in offline mode.\n\nA lot of very simple configurations and settings that I took for granted have been removed.  For example:  you can't do random map rotations.  UT 99 had a simple checkbox that let you enable map rotation to avoid playing the same order every time, or disable for people who hate fun.  It does seem like they've opted to have "mutators" take the place of simple configuration options, and I don't have a strong opinion on that, but they didn't include a mutator to put the random map feature back.\n\nThe bot skill levels are a little wacky.  "Skilled" level bots spend a lot of time standing in one place waiting to be shot.  That seems like something that maybe only the first bot level should do.\n\nThere is some new war mode thing with spheres.  Its kind of cool, although the vehicles are pretty lame.  Especially the hover board.  And Assault is gone.","November 9, 2014","false","4.1"," 6 of 29 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","6","29","0","0"

Now graphics are still awesome even in 2012. The gameplay is still fun and excellent. however they removed some gamemodes which is minor. the weapons are great they have great sound design, they even brought back the enforcers and the impact hammer. now the style i rather like now granted its very gears of war-ish but its still nice. the campaign is meh its not worth playing honestly. now the community is very good, and the mods are awesome. my personal favorites are ballistic weapons, the crucible, and real guns.\n\n9.5/10 awesome game highly recommended but UT2004 is better\n","July 5, 2012","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This particular iteration has fantastic graphics, and fun gameplay in a deathmatch VS style setting. There's even a single player campaign in which you can guide your own course, and make your own decisions. Lots of fun weapons, some classics, a few new, and fun ways to combine primary and alternate fire. This game includes some new vehicles as well. I particuarly like the new tentacle style set, each with unique uses and functions you can maximize through strategic use. Like any deathamtch game, it's all about the maiming and killing, and full of gore, violence, and revenge for the 12 kills made on you by somone else.","November 19, 2010","true","32.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just started playing it again. It's too bad they tried to put a story on top of this game. It really kinda detracts from it.\n\nI've been a big fan of the Unreal series since the original UT way back in... 1997? And strictly speaking, this game should be titled UT4. But whatever. On with the review.\n\nSame gameplay you've come to expect from NotQuake. I've always felt that UT was a bit (not a lot) less twitchy than the Qake series. A bit more... gritty I guess. Quake for me was about the crazy maps, whereas UT has always been about the gameplay. This one doesn't add much to the gameplay, but it's a BIG facelift, and it doesn't add nothing. In place of the relocater, you sometimes get a hoverboard. And vehicles and turrets work much better than in previous titles.\n\nControls are quite good, graphics are top shelf, weapons are interesting but easy to figure out. Gameplay modes are what have come to be standard. Again, the story is just stupid.\n\nIf this was a movie, I'd be telling you it's so bad you have to see it. Unreal Tournament doesn't need a story, and actually suffers for having one. It's so stupid I don't even want to talk about it; I just want to ♥♥♥♥♥ about how mindless it is. Seriously, I will watch Go Fish: the Epic Miniseries before I sit through a cutscene or listen to a dialog in this game.","April 20, 2012","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quite beautiful indeed, definitely a show of what the Unreal engine is capable of. The weapons are for the most part fun to use, all with a secondary mode that makes the battle more interesting. The AI on your team are always a little duller than the rest, so you're forced to join the carnage on a more tactical level.\n\nThe bad? The campaign is a pretty average, as you would expect. The usual "you wronged us and now we're gonna go to great lengths to kill you even though it won't solve anything in the grand scheme of things" storyline. The AI tend to get stuck on each other (or snipe you with Enforcers from the other side of the map if you're giving Godlike a go), and great Scott, if you just add a chainsaw machine gun and a working cover system and you've got Gears of War. Seriously, the armour style, the main antagonist is some crazy chick who wants nothing but pain as far as the eye can see. And not to mention your stereotypical upbeat wise-crackin' black guy.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone interesting in the new and old takes on arena-style first-person shooters.","December 29, 2013","true","30.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This particular iteration has fantastic graphics, and fun gameplay in a deathmatch VS style setting. There's even a single player campaign in which you can guide your own course, and make your own decisions. Lots of fun weapons, some classics, a few new, and fun ways to combine primary and alternate fire. This game includes some new vehicles as well. I particuarly like the new tentacle style set, each with unique uses and functions you can maximize through strategic use. Like any deathamtch game, it's all about the maiming and killing, and full of gore, violence, and revenge for the 12 kills made on you by somone else.","November 19, 2010","true","32.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just started playing it again. It's too bad they tried to put a story on top of this game. It really kinda detracts from it.\n\nI've been a big fan of the Unreal series since the original UT way back in... 1997? And strictly speaking, this game should be titled UT4. But whatever. On with the review.\n\nSame gameplay you've come to expect from NotQuake. I've always felt that UT was a bit (not a lot) less twitchy than the Qake series. A bit more... gritty I guess. Quake for me was about the crazy maps, whereas UT has always been about the gameplay. This one doesn't add much to the gameplay, but it's a BIG facelift, and it doesn't add nothing. In place of the relocater, you sometimes get a hoverboard. And vehicles and turrets work much better than in previous titles.\n\nControls are quite good, graphics are top shelf, weapons are interesting but easy to figure out. Gameplay modes are what have come to be standard. Again, the story is just stupid.\n\nIf this was a movie, I'd be telling you it's so bad you have to see it. Unreal Tournament doesn't need a story, and actually suffers for having one. It's so stupid I don't even want to talk about it; I just want to ♥♥♥♥♥ about how mindless it is. Seriously, I will watch Go Fish: the Epic Miniseries before I sit through a cutscene or listen to a dialog in this game.","April 20, 2012","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You won't recognize the way the weapons look, but after a couple of shots they'll feel like old friends again. You won't recognize the level textures, but the layouts will be familiar.\nThe addition of a storyline in campaign mode, rather than the usual tournament format (Though warfare uses respawners, so it's not that different) is an alien element.

It's quite beautiful indeed, definitely a show of what the Unreal engine is capable of. The weapons are for the most part fun to use, all with a secondary mode that makes the battle more interesting. The AI on your team are always a little duller than the rest, so you're forced to join the carnage on a more tactical level.\n\nThe bad? The campaign is a pretty average, as you would expect. The usual "you wronged us and now we're gonna go to great lengths to kill you even though it won't solve anything in the grand scheme of things" storyline. The AI tend to get stuck on each other (or snipe you with Enforcers from the other side of the map if you're giving Godlike a go), and great Scott, if you just add a chainsaw machine gun and a working cover system and you've got Gears of War. Seriously, the armour style, the main antagonist is some crazy chick who wants nothing but pain as far as the eye can see. And not to mention your stereotypical upbeat wise-crackin' black guy.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone interesting in the new and old takes on arena-style first-person shooters.","December 29, 2013","true","30.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or at least, from my experience. Now, if that is what you want, this here is your Unreal Tournament game. But, if you want a bit more fun, less serious, faster-paced combat and a less dark and creepy atmosphere, go check out Unreal Tournament 2004 and that just might be the Unreal Tournament game you want to buy.

You typically spawn surrounded by every weapon available in the map, and it rarely takes longer than 2 seconds to find yourself in combat. The gravity is low, the speed is high, and the maps are enormous. One would expect things to degenerate into a lacksidasical camp-fest, but victory and a huge pile of enemy heads usually fall to those who fight like true warriors: the lightnight-fast, strafe-jumping, run-and-gunners. The only problem with this game is that there are not enough people playing it, and this is truly a sad thing, since the next best thing, Quake 3, pales in comparison to the frenetic insanity that is the standard in UT super-rifle servers.","February 22, 2014","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although they changed a few things, it's basically the same as UT2004, but with extra stuff.\n\nThat being said...\n\nPROS: Mantaining the essence of UT2004, now this game has a plot story  (more than "we, the team, want to kick some asses to prove to the entire universe that we rule"), something that I never thought I'd see on a UT. Almost the same types of games.\n\nCONS: They removed Onslaught and Assault and changed it for Warfare.\nWarfare is Onslaught but with an Assault feeling.

Has all the classic weapons you'd expect and they feel great, though the rocket launcher's different fire modes are needlessly complicated to switch. The flak cannon used to be my go-to UT weapon but the stinger mini-gun definitely takes the cake this time! There are some cool new gameplay modes and tons of fun maps but I do miss  the old Assault and Domination modes. The vehicles are really cool too! The single player campaign is a bit of a let down, the gameplay is really fun, but the story is hard to follow. A few characters seem cool but never get developed, the few cutscenes and mission briefing voiceovers do not effectively convey the story. It's a shame there weren't more teams/factions/clans introduced, and I was particularly bummed that the Skaarj didn't make an appearance. Character models sadly seemed more like Gears of War leftovers than of Unreal Tournament design. So while the sloppily thrown together single player campaign is a tad disappointing, the overall gameplay is still great fun and it looks great.

It's quite beautiful indeed, definitely a show of what the Unreal engine is capable of. The weapons are for the most part fun to use, all with a secondary mode that makes the battle more interesting. The AI on your team are always a little duller than the rest, so you're forced to join the carnage on a more tactical level.\n\nThe bad? The campaign is a pretty average, as you would expect. The usual "you wronged us and now we're gonna go to great lengths to kill you even though it won't solve anything in the grand scheme of things" storyline. The AI tend to get stuck on each other (or snipe you with Enforcers from the other side of the map if you're giving Godlike a go), and great Scott, if you just add a chainsaw machine gun and a working cover system and you've got Gears of War. Seriously, the armour style, the main antagonist is some crazy chick who wants nothing but pain as far as the eye can see. And not to mention your stereotypical upbeat wise-crackin' black guy.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone interesting in the new and old takes on arena-style first-person shooters.","December 29, 2013","true","30.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are comparable to what we suppose would be the graphics of 2020, with additional applicable 3D options to enhance the experience. The issue that this game states is that 'feel' that unearthed when roaming UT2004; those options of being able to control the arena are lost, and the ability of the player degraded (I've certainly found that the 'Experienced' level on this is in some way harder than the 'Skilled' options of its direct predecessor (equivalent level 3 and 4 respectively).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Riaktion/recommended/13210/","Riaktion","Riaktion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Riaktion/","505 products in account","Wow... What a game this is! I sorely misunderstood it's strengths and underestimated this game for years. I've always tried to play through the single player campaign and always bounced right off it as that mode is genuinely terrible, repetitive and boring. However as I'll go onto explain, this was a mistake.\n\nFirstly, the reason for not enjoying the campaign mode is due to it focusing on the "Capture the Flag" and "Warfare" team modes. Capture the Flag (CTF) is a familair game type and Warfare is about Capturing Control Points which includes vehicles you can use to fight your battles along with the usual weapons. Warfare matches in particular are normally set on huge sprawling battle fields for it to take place across... so why is this terrible?\n\nIt boils down to the Bot AI specifically for Warfare (CTF isn't too bad to be fair)... simple as that. They cannot play this team mode in any fun way and these long.. drawn out...  tug of war matches get mired in stalemate and boredom. There are only so many times you can spend minutes trekking across a huge map to be killed pointlessly and then respawn to do it again.\n\nWith human teams, working together to co-ordinate attack and defence, I imagine it would be great... but the bots know nothing of a high strategy and the game degenerates into pockets of combat that just chew up and spit everyone out resulting in a grind. No flanking, feints, different paths of attack or even retreating, just running at each other, fighting, dying and doing it again which is ultimately what the player is drawn into as well. Awful...  and so UT3 was in my view the worst game of the series... UNTIL! I ignored the campaign mode and just worked through every available map via the Instant Action option (i.e. Custom Match Mode), sticking to the game types I enjoyed.\n\nPlaying like this is BRILLIANT...  I played Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Greed ( a form of deathmatch CTF) and Instagib deathmatch (one hit kills) all on Adept difficulty and just ignored the other modes I didn't like or just weren't enjoyable to play with bots... and man alive what a game!\n\nThe speed, the sound, the graphics, the weapons..  adept diffculty was the exact amount of challenge for me at the time of writing. Every match was an unknown and I never went into a game confident I'd win or sure I'd lose. UT3 is on par with the mighty UT 1999 (IMHO) when it comes to playing with bots on the main Deathmatch modes. It is great!\n\nI ended up playing 145 matches across those 4 modes on every map to eventually win them all, and that doesn't include the games I played on the campaign in co-op with Steam friends, or the experiments with some of the other modes like Betrayal or CTF. Truely an excellent game when you stick to it's strengths and I enjoyed "completing" the game per my own rules for doing so.\n\nI think making my own objectives within some games is going to breathe new life into them where I have stopped playing due to a lack of direction from the game or a terrible single player story / campaign mode. It's not something I have done before... as silly as that sounds, and I am glad I did here as it opened my eyes to an excellent game.\n\nAlthough I have completed my "Adept" run, I'll be trying again on harder difficulties and downloading user maps for sure. This game will likely stay on my hard drive for a long time and the "time played" (currently 35hrs) will increase beyond what is recorded here, just like UT 1999.","November 18, 2013","true","62.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XenovuzXapter/recommended/13210/","XenovuzXapter","XenovuzXapter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XenovuzXapter/","87 products in account","Introduction: This has been one of mine favorite video game franchises ever since I played Unreal Tournament 2004!\nAnd coming to this one I wouldn't say everything is great about this as compared to UT2K4 especially the movement and gravity though it can be fixed with mods but besides that there are many new games modes like Greed, Betrayal and the improved Onslaught mode from UT2K4 called Warfare which is my favorite as its relatively more balanced now.\nI didn't like the Titan mutator much but then again it can be turned off.\nThe amount of community made mods, maps and other stuff is big though not as big as UT2K4.\n\nWeapons: The shield gun has been replaced with the Impact Hammer from the original UT and all other weapons have been modified in some way or the other which is a mixed bag in my opinion. Translocator is also still there for non vehicular combat game modes.\n\nVehicles: With the inclusion of the new Necris faction in to the Unreal Tournament universe there are several new vehicles on top of those which already existed in UT2K4 so I can't describe all of them in detail here because I initially wanted to as each and every vehicle is fun to use! So if you get the game just jump in to Vehicle Capture The Flag or Warfare and try them out yourself! Besides this a new Translocator alternative called the Hoverboard has been added for vehicular combat game modes.\n\nCampaign: Even though I have played all the Unreal Tournament games I'm not a that big fan of its storyline so I didn't expect much from this ones Campaign either as its boring with only a few cutscenes. Though if you have a friend then I would suggest playing Co Op on the Insane difficulty mode! You can add me as well if you want to play Co Op!\n\nMultiplayer: Since the new Unreal Tournament has been in development which is currently in Beta as of now the Multiplayer community has been mostly dead so at this point of time it is a little hard even for a big fan of this series like me to blindly recommend this for Multiplayer which is one of the strongest point of this game. Mostly you will find bots on the servers though you can find some dedicated players occassionally.\n\nConclusion: Overall in short you can consider this game during a sale if you haven't played a fast paced First Person Shooter in a while which relies on a lot of things like skills, reflexes, strategy and team work depending on the game mode. There aren't any locked content except character visual customization so you have everything available from the start for an instant action!","December 21, 2015","true","54.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
