As the developer. Sorry if it's a bit stream of consciousness because I want this to come from the heart.\n\nThe 11 of us all took a lot of risk to make this, and sacrificed financially to give Firewatch a chance. We all could have had much better paying jobs elsewhere, but we all thought this game idea had potential to be something special. We seemed to like each other ok, so we all took a big leap of faith. Two years, we say. Let's give this a go, worst outcome is we all hate each other and go back to various money jobs, but we all could say, WE TRIED.\n\nTwo years +. We are all crammed in a tiny office, sharing one bathroom. It is not a glamorous thing, making an independent game. It is just a small room full of computers and a used microwave and $10 office chairs we luckily got from craigslist. Life happened during those two years: there were big breakups, profound illnesses of loved ones, a baby, etc. The dev team got to be like family, because that's how making an indie game is, you are all in it together, through thick and thin, supporting one another bc if you don't, there is no way in hell this game would get made, let alone any chance of it to be worth more than a bucket of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nWe were excited, but terrified. We felt free, but were constrained. I have been in this industry for 15 years almost, and this is the hardest I have ever worked. We all gave it our all, to make this weird thing, and we had no idea if it was any good to anybody else. All we could do, was try the damn hardest to make something we are honestly proud of. At the end, if this was a commercial failure, all we have got is what we have made. Nobody could take that away.\n\nSo yes, I am sad when people think this game is not worth the money we asked for (which we thought was a fair ask). It makes me feel like I failed them. It is ok if people don't like the game, but it affects me personally a lot, when people feel like it was not -worth- the time they engaged with it.\n\nBut do I blame you for wanting to get the most out of your $18? No. I don't know your financial circumstances. $18 might be a lot. Or even it isn't a lot, why shouldnt' you try to get the most out of it? That's a fair desire. That's why we asked for $18 too, because money is something we could all use more of.\n\nSo I supopse in conclusion, if you do refund, I am not upset. It's on me to learn not to care too much. All I ask is that maybe sometime in the future, when the game goes on mega dirt cheap sale, you could gift tthe experience to someone else you think will enjoy it like you did.\n\nSincerely,\nJane"\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/383870/discussions/0/412446890557047927/#c412446890557147384\n\n-----------\n\nBelow is my response...\n\n-----------\n\nJane:\n\nThank you for your heartfelt perspective.\n\nI bought Firewatch after reading your post, and I just completed it tonight. It took me a little over 5 hours, start to finish, because I explored a lot in the immersive world that you helped create. Needless to say, I loved the experience. It reminded me a lot of Gone Home, which I also cherished.\n\nThanks for your contribution to this effort. The world design and artwork were beautiful, and you are to be commended for your creative and technical skills. Thanks also for stepping out of your comfort zone, undertaking the risk of develping an indie game, and sacrificing so much personally and professionally to create this emotionally moving work of art.\n\nPlease don't apologize for caring too much. The gaming world of 2016 is much better off with Firewatch than without it, and if you and your colleagues hadn't cared quite so much, this game might never have been made.\n\nThanks again!\n\nRespectfully,\n\nA Very Happy Customer :)","March 4","true","5.7"," 584 of 639 people (91%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","91","584","639","23","7"

But as art goes, probably not for everyone.\nThe whole gameplay is story + dialog driven, with a touch of exploration. Which also means, there is not much action, the focus is clearly on atmosphere and the protagonists.\n\nYou have a troublesome past which you fled from and the woman on the other side as well. You try to make your job at the end of the world while talking about what you see, do and also have experienced in your past.\n\n\nThis game...* is very atmopsheric, both in graphics as in world design\n* lives from its dialogs\n* is for people who like a witty conversational partner and enjoy puns\n* is very immersive, as it does not use an UI\n\nBut it's not...* a game where you save the world\n* full of dramatic action, nor features a super-duper-climatic ending\n* a simulation where you have to spot and fight fires\n* survival based\n\nIt still has some flaws, as...* the world is not that big (which is covered up by its nice level design)\n* it's not very long with only 4-5hrs gameplay tops\n* your decisions/dialogue options have only minor impact on the story. There are some very neat responds to what you do (i.e. if you take the wiskey bottle, the dialog responds to that later), but no real game-changing events\n* due to the decision impact, it lacks replayability\n\nBut I still really recommend it because...* the stile is very unique (in a positive way, "art")\n* the dialogue varies between very deep thoughts and quite funny jokes\n* the story and both protagonists could really be like this in the real world\n* albeit it's pretty short, I have more memories about it than to any shooter or many other games\n\n\nTL;DRIf you don't need to shoot everyting that moves and heartily enjoy an evening walk, clever conversations and a differnt kind of story, you should grab this game and have an relaxed but awesome evening you will remember for a long time.","April 17","true","5.0"," 316 of 352 people (90%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","90","316","352","35","1"

Short, but that's not a big issue. My biggest beef is with the ending - it ended very abruptly for me, and the payoff wasn't there. Up until the last second, I was expecting more, and if this was Firewatch, Episode 1, I would've given a 9/10. Unfortunately, it looks like that's the end of the adventure, and so I'd rate this 5/10.\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting\n- Environment is great\n- The game really grabs you, especially midway through\n- Not too much backtracking\n\nCons:\n- Decently short (3/4 hours)\n- Bait and switch ending, really waiting for a twist that never comes\n- Feels like they ran out of budget and just tried to wrap the game up\n- Feels like the game is on rails\n\nEssentially, I feel a bit cheated by the promises made by the marketing, as they promised a different experience than I got. I can see where the devs were trying to go with this in terms of emotion and story, but it felt like a letdown to me.\n","February 9","false","4.1"," 1,034 of 1,300 people (80%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","80","034","1","13","40"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KillingArts/recommended/383870/","KillingArts","KillingArts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KillingArts/","5064 products in account","Firewatch is probably one of the best walking simulators ever. The walking is a bit more interactive than in many other games. You have to navigate with a map that doesn't show your direction, and a compass. That alone keeps you kind of busy and makes the walking less boring. I will still say that I started to get a little bored sometimes, when I had to walk great distances to the next destination.\n\nBut that was only when there was no voiceover. Because the voice acting in this game is absolutely fantastic. The two actors did a really great job. I can't think of any game that had voice acting on that level. The dialogue is very well written. It's funny. It's sad. It's intense when it needs to be. Just awesome. Henry and Delilah are both fantastic characters, and the growing relationship between them is interesting, and not as one-dimensional as stuff like this usually is in games. I liked it a lot.\n\nThe ending is at least questionable. I expected something else, to be honest. The game gets more intense as you go, until you really can't wait to get to the conclusion. And when you're finally there - well, I was a little disappointed. It's an interesting idea. But not really what I wanted. This is a personal preference, of course. Some people will like it, others will not.\n\nThe game is relatively short. It took me 4.4 hours, and I didn't rush it. I really took my time and looked at all the items I could find. You have to decide for yourself, if a 4 hour game is worth 20€. For me it was.\n\n8/10","February 14","true","4.4"," 499 of 664 people (75%) found this review helpful 75 people found this review funny","75","499","664","75","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnivore/recommended/383870/","somnivore","Chewable C++","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnivore/","2644 products in account","Firwatch Firewatch is an enjoyable "first-person mystery" by a small team of folks who know what they are doing.\n\nApplying the "walking simulator" is not inaccurate, but that may be too dismissive of the refined experience Firewatch offers.\n\nMuch walking through a nicely realized, highly stylized forest environment is involved, but the most notable ingredient of the game is your character's interaction with the other main character via portable radio - one of the finer examples of such interaction in the video game medium.\n\nThe game starts by building a backstory of your character via text, allowing you to make several choices - an effective technique to help you identify with your character. These choices are later reflected in dialogue (although they do not, as far as I know, have a significant impact on the plot). The dialogue mechanic, the control over dialogue responses effectively facilitates immersion and the dialogue is very well voiced.\n\nFirewatch does a good job at pacing, at maintaining suspense. Although, you can choose at times to wander off on a few detours and delay story progression. There's a decent amount of optional secrets and details to discover, but not very many - if short on time, don't worry about them and just stick to the goals at hand, as you won't miss much. The game can last about 4-8 hours depending on how much you stray/dawdle.\n\nPerhaps the most questionable aspect of the game is the hype and marketing that emphasizes the mystery. There certainly is mystery, and it's pretty good, but many, perhaps even most, might be surprised and perhaps disappointed that the story progression doesn't match quite the expectations they had. Although I did feel a mild sense of being the victim of misdirection, I liked the story, and the game.\n\nThe other perhaps surprising but astute design principle here is what isn't explicitly shown. The (visual and auditory) presentation is such that much is left to the imagination and exposition is trickle-fed. A cynic might accuse this paradigm of being a cost saving measure. And maybe it is. But, it is effective at engaging the player's mind.\n\nI recommend Firewatch as a short but good interactive mystery experience, especially if it's on sale.","February 23","true","7.1"," 209 of 265 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","209","265","8","6"

Having said that...\n\nI have mixed feelings.  I don't the mind the short length of the game, as I understood going in that it was a narrative focused experience.  The problem is that experience did not pay off in the end.  I'm able to tolerate cliff hangers of all kinds (I have read all of George RR Martin's books without having  multiple strokes).  But, this game, as beautiful as the visuals were, took little advantage of the possibilities the story had and completely fell flat at the end.  I literally sighed and thought "surely there is more" even as the credits rolled.\n\nConsidering the raging fire at the end, and the "tying up" of the father/son story bit, the ending took little to no advantage of these circumstances.  There were so many great climactic possibilities there but instead...they just ended it with a sort of "Well, that's life" message.  No kidding, I'm fully aware that life can suck, hence the use of video games like this to escape it.\n\nIt's really ashame that so many are hailing this as "deep" and "insightful" when in reality, if this were the narrative of any novel in a bookstore, it wouldn't sell 1000 copies.  The story was building and building and building, only to end with no payoff.\n\nVisually, it's stunning, and I kept thinking how great it would be to have an open world, multiplayer game in such a beautifully crafted world.  The light shafts through the trees, the color schemes and contrasts were amazing.  In fact, the visuals are about the only reason I don't feel completely cheated with this purchase.\n\nWhat story purpose did the camera serve?  Why did I board up the windows after the break-in?  Why did I explore the child's fort?  Why collect any of the notes and letters?  On and on there were experiences that felt like they'd build into something.  Instead, they were just "rest stops" in a story going no where.\n\nThe voice acting was great, but again, the story didn't live up to the talent those voice actors gave it.\n\nIf you like a beautiful walking simulator then purchase it.  If you are hoping for a real story, you won't find it here, no matter how many fanboys tell you so.  There are 3-4 different major plot lines in this game, and none of them come to any real closure.","February 11","false","4.9"," 1,100 of 1,540 people (71%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","71","100","1","42","54"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperatorKerri/recommended/383870/","OperatorKerri","Kerri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperatorKerri/","625 products in account","Let me just say, I was ready to defend this game to the end of the Earth after the first 20 minutes, but as you can see, that's not the case.  The 6-8 hours of gameplay, minimum (if rushing), that the developers promised is a lie.\n\n"It's like waking up on Christmas day only to discover every present is just an empty cardboard box."\n\nFirst of all, the gameplay is non-existent. It might as well have been on-rails or a point and click game. There are no puzzles, it is literally you walking to a destination and 'interacting' with whatever plot point is there.\n\nNow, I have absolutely no issue with a game like that. There are plenty of story-driven games where the gameplay is non-existent (or worse, simply bad), but they actually have a story. Firewatch does not. Absolutely nothing that happens in the game is of any consequence. If you've watched the gameplay trailers, you'll know that they make a big deal out of a shadowy figure and two teenage girls going missing, with you being the last person to see them.  Spoiler alert; those teens just show up safe and sound at the end of the game, there was no mystery to solve, no overarching plot. They have absolutely no bearing on ANYTHING. And don't get me started on the sorry excuse for a plot point that the shadowy figure is, it's not even worth discussing it's so inconsequential.\n\nNOW, HAVING SAID ALL OF THE ABOVE. The dialogue is great, very witty, but there isn't some abundance of choices you have. You're railroaded into either a witty line, an angry line that ends the conversation, or simply saying nothing. I was hoping that with the lack of gameplay and plot, the dialogue would be the game's saving grace, with how you interact with Delilah actually having some impact, perhaps even having some kind of moral dilemma at the end of the game where you choose to go home to a wife that doesn't recognise or love you, or you follow your heart and start again. "Hey, that would have been interesting", I hear you say. Well tough luck, nothing you do has any bearing on the ending. No matter if you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ her off or you flirted with her to eternity, she leaves you with your limp sausage in your hand as she flies off in a helicopter, abandoning you for this mysterious Javier character.\n\nAnd let's not get onto the most INFURIATING aspect of this game. This game, I'm positive, was designed with just enough 'gameplay' to pad out 2 hours, enough for you not to be able to refund the game and get your hard earned money back. That's right, this title took me just 2 hours to complete, once you factor out me being alt-tabbed, and that's with me going out of my way to explore and not abusing the map to find direct routes to places. Many of us whom were hyped about this game became so through the gameplay videos. What those videos show is LITERALLY ALL of the game mechanics, and 80% of the plot. Literally all they left out was the opening title cards and the last 20 minutes.\n\nThis was only the second game I've preordered, the other being The Witcher 3 (which gave me 300 hours, for a little over double the price). Let's just say I've learned my lesson and won't be doing so again.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGoing to add a bit more and put down ways I think the game could be improved, since at least a couple of people have agreed with my thoughts.\n\nRight off the bat, the first 45 minutes (before they scramble to have some overarching plot in regards to Ned and the whole conspiracy thing) is extremely enjoyable, if the game was just more of that, and a bit longer, I might have been satisfied.\n\nFirst of all, a walking simulator where you're supposed to be exploring the woods needs to be open. Firewatch's map consists of about 4 valleys, which are narrow corridors. There are no areas 'off the beaten path', the most you get to explore is the two or three areas where the path branches off, but both routes terminate in the same area. The game world needs to be much larger, and much more open. Have reasons to explore, things to find, easter eggs, etc.\n\nThe whole Ned plotline was hamfisted and ultimately pointless, I feel like the game's plot would have been much more enjoyable if it was more regular Fire Lookout/Forest Ranger activities, like chasing kids setting off fireworks, tracking bears, calling out fires, etc., with an overarching plot that concerns the two girls that go missing (they go missing, you being the last person to see them, delilah falsifying reports, notes being left around camp trying to frame/blackmail you would have been very interesting and that could have made a very interesting murder mystery plot)\n\nHell, if the devs wanted to be lazy, they could have left the game exactly as it is now, but add some kind of moral dilemma at the end, where you have to choose between going home to care for a wife who doesn't recognise you anymore, nevermind loves you, or trying to salvage some kind of happy existence with Delilah, feeding off the fact that the voice acting is the only strong suit in the game currently. But no, you get to the end of the game, and no matter your choice of dialogue over the last 3 months with this Delilah character, and implications of phone sex, etc., she just abandons you to a potentially fiery death as she evacuates on a helicopter instead of waiting for you. It left me so bitter, and if it was done differently, I might have been satisfied with the game.\n\ntl;dr Open map with actual exploration, some kind of plot regarding the missing teens instead of what we got, and a moral dilemma at the end, including a decision between your wife and Delilah. Oh, and make it a little longer than 2 hours for good measure.","February 9","false","3.1"," 1,032 of 1,457 people (71%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","71","032","1","57","71"

I didn't even mind the high price tag for the supposedly short 6 hours of gameplay as I was expecting a good mystery for my character to solve. But all in all, I was pretty disappointed with how the game unfolded.\n\n+ Beautiful graphics.\n+ Very atmospheric.\n+ Good soundtrack.\n+ Excellent voice acting for the witty dialogues.\n+ Engaging story at the start and towards the middle.\n\n- Story didn't really deliver. It started off strong and then just fell flat / boring towards the end. Some parts were predictable.\n- Very short (expected at least 6 hours of gameplay, got only 4.5hours).\n- No consequences of your dialogue choices.\n- No replay value.\n- Price tag is too high for its current content.\n- Linear. Since this is more like a walking simulator, I was expecting a bigger map, if not an open world.\n- Expected a good mystery but got a flirty woman on the radio instead.\n\nBuy it if you don't mind a walking simulator with a subpar storyline, but I simply cannot recommend it at its current price; there's just not enough content to justify the price tag. Get it only when it's heavily discounted.\n\nEDIT: Like a lot of people, I wish there's a Neutral button that I could give it. It's not a bad game per se, it has its merits and I did enjoy some parts of it. But with its current $20 base price (less in my regional Steam store), I got about 4 hours of gameplay.

Both its two central characters -  Henry and Delilah  - have had incidents happen in their lives which has left them emotionally strung out or inaccessible. Through a short montage of emotionally heartfelt words we soon learn why Henry - the character the player controls - has taken it upon himself to isolate himself in a forest as vast and expansive as the Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming USA for the summer of 1989 as a firewatcher. Delilah on the other hand, who is stationed at the opposite end of the forest at another lookout post is Henry's immediate senior and boss. When we first hear Delilah introduce herself to Henry she is flirty and playful  but we  soon learn that Delilah has a tendency to keep the world around her largely at arms length. Could both these characters end up being foils for one another? Well you will have to play Firewatch to find out.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=634544775\nWhile I am not the worlds biggest fan of first person exploration games with this partly tempered by my recent exposure to the genre where of the three I did take for a spin around the block - the one left me underwhelmed with its contrived "shock" ending (The Vanishing of Ethan Carter), the other was so obtuse it was like going on a date with a person that spoke in white noise (Dear Esther) with the final one being a pretentious piece of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ masquerading as philosophical alumni with the purplest prose this side of Oscar Wilde (Leviathan : The Old City which I absolutely hated with a fiery, burning passion). I was hoping that Firewatch would be able to find the middle-ground between telling an engaging story with actual characters that resembled relatable adult human beings and not blank canvases, contrived gumshoe detectives that see "dead people" or characters that resemble clowns with their flowery exposition.\n\nFive minutes into Firewatch I knew I had found that game as both Henry and Delilah actually converse like real adults would with realistic dialog that echoes their temporary happiness or compounds their pain and loneliness. Occasionally some sequences in the game will give rise to panic and both characters are not adverse to using colourful language that is laden with expletives. If you have young children around you then perhaps this is not the game to be playing when small ears are within listening shot as Firewatch is a mature gaming experience dealing with loneliness and loss (including the losing of the self - a perfect metaphor for the forest on more than one occasion where the forest rightfully claims what it believes belongs to it). Most of this anyway  will fly over the little ones heads and part of me wishes that the game came with a big warning - that only mature adults need apply since I feel that even most younger gamers will find it boring despite its heavy adult themes that will be perhaps lost on those who have never felt them before.\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623446181\nMost of Firewatch's 79 or so odd days (although their are not really 79 gameplay days) these two characters will get to know one another through the use of walkie-talkies as Henry explores the vast park under the command and watchful eye of Delilah. It is through these sequences as you wonder through the isolated wilderness that both these characters begin to flesh themselves out becoming more and more real as they speak candidly about their life experiences or try to dodge conversations where difficult topics are raised. With Henry feeling particularly vulnerable and fragile at the start of the game, he soon embarks on uncovering a mystery around the disappearance of two teenage girls who have been camping in the park. Given his emotional state its quite plausible that he jumps to some of the conclusions he does. It's not long however before the real mystery of the park surfaces and while I found it slightly contrived it is no less heartbreaking.\n\nA lot of people have expressed displeasure with how Firewatch ends and initially I also kind of felt cheated by it as there was no big emotional payoff especially given the series of events that play out towards the end. I had to go away and think about if for a bit and now that I have it really was the smart way to end the game.  It's no mystery that Henry becomes more and more emotionally dependent on Delilah as the game progresses. It even gets to the point near the end where Henry starts to see Delilah as his emotional savior. For Delilah - her Achilles heel is the inability to deal with this emotional dependence once it surfaces which explains why each summer she hides herself away from the world in the park. Various notes uncovered lying around the park from previous rangers and firewatchers depict a similar fate of her simply abandoning them. The ending was Delilah's personality going through its motions. Another clue is how Delilah literally goes out of her way never to meet up with Henry even when dropping off various goods and necessities around the park despite them sharing some very personal information about one another\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623807447\nFirewatch grapples with some serious adult issues and in the end succeeds admirably thanks to some very strong writing that has its two main characters saying things that could  have come straight from your very own mouth. This tale of two lonely souls who find each other in a forest may not have that happy "Hollywood" ending that I think most where expecting at least its a true ending that doesn't have these very characters doing a ninety degree about-face which would not have been plausible or believable given their emotional tapestry.

I liked some parts of it and hated others. So my opinion of this game is a no with a heavy heart. Wish there was something like percentages... cause it's roughly 50/50 like dislike for me. Why? No, I just have to get this out of my chest - I even brought my freakingly inferior laptop to work for the night shift just to go ahead and finish the game! I was so looking forward to the endgame story I wanted to see happening, and didn't find it. The early game got me stoked, the midgame got me absolutely hooked and the endgame doused me with supercold water, giving me the proverbial Ice Bucket.\n\nFirewatch is a game about Henry, a person whose wife suffers from a terrible sickness, and he decides to take a job as a Firewatch in Wyoming in order to escape reality, collect himself, and decide how to proceed. There he meets Delilah, his boss with a sexy voice who guides him through the entirety of his adventure.\n\nIn true fashion for my reviews, I will go through the good and the bad.\n\nThe GOOD:\n\n1. Beautiful park to explore, consisting of caves, ravines, forest areas, mountainous landscapes, canyons, you name it.\n2. Exploring the park gives you this awesome zen feeling of relaxation and puts a smile on your face.\n3. The witty jokes and jabs between the two main protagonists are so fun to listen and respond to.\n4. An extremely pleasant soundtrack.\n5. The game is more of a walking simulator than a mystery adventure experience. It is a damn good one though.\n6. You get to take pictures that would remind you of your adventure.\n7. You actually have a compass and a map. I was expecting another long dark... Thank god it is not.\n\nThe BAD:\n1. The story is very subpar. It has a nice buildup and it's as if they wanted to make something epic but... got scared or fell short of it. You get prepared to this big event... and nothing much happens. Saying anything more would be a spoiler.\n2. The story is extremely predictable. I was sure what's going to happen, and was waiting for the big punch... which never came.\n3. The soundtrack, albeit great, seems to few and far inbetween. You will be hiking for a while without any sound.\n4. The game is short as hell, clocking at about 3.5 hours even if you're not running.\n5. There are no multiple endings from what it seems. I have tried to approach some situations differently, and all Delilah does is change her lines and still get back to the main point.\n6. Even though you get to make some pictures... that's all there is to it, and the game doesn't even tell you that you should (apart from once). I took pictures of all the suspicious things I found in order to deal with the police if necessary... Just to see them all in the credits. Thanks, but no thanks. As I said in my post on the steam forums, I even opted not to upload them, because all of them would have been huge spoilers!!!\n7. The ending was not satisfactory for me... I so wished there would be more, and I hope they release some free dlcs to round up the story. There is simply no CLOSURE!\n8. The replaybility seems to be all about playing again as Henry being a jackass, saying bad things to Delilah, or saying almost nothing, and so on...\n9. The price tag is very high. I would totally pick it at 50% off though.\n10. I tried to follow the suggestions of some people on the forums to ignore the story and just have fun. Sadly, all I found was walled off areas by bushes or thickets that you need to clear with an item that... was behind the wall of bushes. I am sorry to report that this type of exploration isn't there - at least until you go halfway through the game and a certain event.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI am giving this game a no with a heavy heart. I know I had awesome time for the first 2 hours, laughing at the jabs between the the main protagonists, and having a blast exploring the the park. But then... it just pettered out. I was waiting for this huge showdown, but I was treated to just tapes and pieces of the story. There is so much buildup for nothing. No, I just have to get this out of my chest - I even brought my freakingly inferoir laptop to work for the night shift just to go ahead and finish the game! I was so looking forward to the endgame story I wanted to see happening, and didn't find it. The early game got me stoked, the midgame got me absolutely hooked and the endgame doused me with supercold water. As I said in the comments, Thing is, I don't want much :) If they have put just a simple a text screen before the credits saying what happened with whom and how they went on with their lives, my review would have been positive, but they just ended the whole thing... On the positive side, there is a lot to like about this game, and as I said in my other reviews, something or someone that puts a smile on your face is priceless. But overall, with the bad outweighing the good so seriously, I can't really recommend it.","February 9","false","6.7"," 555 of 814 people (68%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","68","555","814","11","26"

You play as Henry, who is accompanied by the lovely Delilah -- your only source of connection outside the forest. I will say no more due to spoilers but I was instantly immersed in the story from the get go and I adored the chemistry and voice acting of the two main characters. For a very small dev team its a big story and they did a great job!\n\nPros:\nBeautiful graphics. The colours and the artstyle were just stunning. I could see me going back to this game to use screenshots in a showcase\nFantastic Story (the feels from the beginning). From the start the characters come to life and I was instantly immersed\nThe soundtrack is awesome. Most of the time there is just the life around you buzzing but when the music hits... Wow!\nVoice acting is very good and the chemistry between Henry and Delilah is awesome. A few moments made me smile and laugh away. Very well done\nThe main story is awesome but there are many secrets for explorers\nThe characters are very well designed and are pretty in-depth\n\nCons:\nNow I say this not because of me but others have considered it very short for the £15 price tag... I however feel like anything more would have ruined the impact of the story and/or dragged it out and I would have lost interest. (I don't mean it is not a very interesting story. More it did what it set out to do and I'm happy with it)\nWhich brings me to the next part -- the story was good from the beginning and I was captivated, conversely the ending was poorly done. I felt it left many questions unanswered and left me wanting more (and not in the good sense.) However, the progress of the journey made me happy enough to recommend the game\nSome of the animations for me felt like they were a little dragged out. It is a small issue but I could feel myself just blankly staring waiting for the animation to end\nLastly, I feel the game didn't run as well as it should have (I will leave my specs down below.) But I ran this game in ultra settings and yet in various parts of the game I would drop to 34-40 fps. It was playable but it was something to look out for.\nOverall, this is a solid game with a solid story and I would recommend getting it. Whether you love walking simulators(buy it full price) or you just would like to get lost in a story for 4-5 hours (maybe on sale). I would give the game a 7/10\n\nPC specs:\n\nGPU: GTX 970\nCPU: i5 4690k\nRAM: 16gb","April 3","true","5.1"," 100 of 128 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","100","128","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drahon45/recommended/383870/","drahon45","Crusader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drahon45/","243 products in account","First off, let's get it out of the way and say that yes, the game is extremely short. It took me about three hours to play all the way through the story. With no incentive to replay it, the game might not be worth the asking price for many people who read this review. If you don't want to pay $20 for a 3 hour experience, then that is fine, and respectable.\n\nHowever, the experience that you're buying here is something unlike other games you've played. Firewatch, no matter what all the naysayers believe, is a very groundbreaking game. It did something no other game has ever done for me: make me feel like I was talking to an actual human being when I had conversations with Delilah as Henry. The connection you build with her is something unlike anything you'll see in another game. It just feels so... real. She feels like a real person. I believe that the feeling is amplified by the fact that you never really see a physical representation of Delilah in the game. You only ever speak to her through your handy walkie-talkie, which means the only thing I ever associated her with, was with a real, breathing human.\n\nThe story that Firewatch tells is also an extremely believable, heart-wrenching, and yet heart-warming one. I'll not go into details or spoilers, but let's just say that the story is a very human mystery, and has a few twists that leave you pondering every single thing you ever did in the game, and wondering how it was all connected. The story wasn't something that will completely blow your mind and make you rethink your life, but it is just that hint of subtlety that makes it so enjoyable. It just feels so real, man.\n\nI believe that the price tag on Firewatch is worthwhile. The beauty of the landscape in which the game is set isn't really comparable to very many other games. The world is exquisitely detailed, and the art style does a lot for the overall atmosphere the game is going for. Photorealism wasn't something that the developers were going for, as the art has a very cartoonish, animated feeling - and yet all of the finer details in the world are still there, such as print on the back of some of the books found in the game that can actually be read. The environment will immerse you in your surroundings, and if not for your map and compass and Delilah's guidance, it would be quite easy to get lost in the extensive wilderness in which the game is set. On top of that, the voice acting in the game is probably some of the best you'll ever hear. For such a small title, it is astonishing how well voice acted it was. The voice acting certainly helped to add to the immersion of the world, but it also helps justify the price of the title, as quality like that can't come cheap.\n\nIn the end, if you're looking for a quick, hearty game that you want to make you feel something, then this game is definitely worth your time, and your money. If you don't have the cash to fork out for a game you'll probably only ever play once, then I don't think this title is for you.","February 10","true","3.5"," 327 of 477 people (69%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","69","327","477","15","8"

Though its aesthetics and settings might lead to the perception of some natural focus – canyons and forests of the Wyoming wilderness forming a backdrop to elevate a narrative of environmental concerns, perhaps, or at least one in which the outdoors inform the game’s trajectory beyond mere blunt scenery – Firewatch is wholly absorbed in the interpersonal drama between its two main characters, Henry and Delilah.\n\nHenry is a man running from his problems; Delilah has already gotten that far but still can’t put her own problems out of mind. Together they form what could be described as Firewatch’s soul; the humanity hidden beneath inconsistent world building and awkward mechanical conceits which holds the game together, if only insofar as people keep talking. For as tired and archetypical as its two troubled protagonists are, Firewatch is successful through its refusal to ever satisfy the player. Though it begins in a familiar place, Henry and Delilah’s story is never allowed to diverge onto the path you expect it, and most likely want it to take. Firewatch constantly dangles relief just outside of reach, situations and conversations building upon the uncertainty and anxiety of two people so completely lost in their lives looking for a way out, even if it means destroying themselves in the process.\n\nThis isn’t to say that Firewatch is grim, so much as it’s uncompromising. There is a delicate balance struck between wit and sobriety which allows Firewatch to be at once charmingly aloof and unpleasantly blunt. The only significant form of exposition comes by way of the radio conversations between Henry and Delilah, and a lot of care has been put into the way you as a third person are in both direct and subtle ways influencing and witnessing their relationship develop. Often you are afforded a personal choice as to the tone a conversation takes on, which by nature of being (if only slightly) player directed causes Henry and Delilah to feel like more dynamic characters. But it is also in what Firewatch doesn’t tell you that contributes to their authenticity, with days and sometimes weeks going by without your involvement, and scenes often fading to black before the entirety of a conversation can be told.\n\nAgain there is a willingness to frustrate the player for the sake of creating more compelling and autonomous characters, and while this could have fallen apart and left us with a game bereft of depth and cohesion it’s such a conscious and considered decision that it creates an experience that feels confident in its own ambiguity and discontent. Even up to the end after all questions are laid clean and revelations prove far less fantastical than the possibilities leading to them, Firewatch remains deliberately unsatisfying and sometimes even intensely frustrating. All to the point that the world Firewatch wishes to portray is inherently unfair and unexciting, and often the ways in which we try to find meaning within that framework are only for the sake of our own gratification and to satisfy the belief that there is a purpose to this all. Because ultimately Firewatch’s narrative is decidedly mundane even in its least ordinary moments, only taking on a larger significance in the presence of its two characters who are so very distressed and by nature feel so relatable and well realized in their attempts to make sense of the impossible.\n\nThere is the immediate impulse to feel outraged at Firewatch’s audacity to so completely reject the player, but beyond that there is something to be said for examining our own need to feel justified by the media we consume, when maybe there is more to be said by never arriving at the happy or thrilling conclusion we expect.\n\nBut for all its narrative unorthodoxy Firewatch is a far less cohesive game than it is a storytelling device. Firewatch is so careful in its exposition and dialogue that it’s bizarre and agonizing that none of that care has been put into considering the way in which the game’s world and its mechanical habits interact with one another. Firewatch plays like a string of narrative conveniences and diversions, introducing new mechanics and ways to use them in such transparent fashion as to shatter the illusion of being present in this world so much of the game is predicated upon reinforcing. Firewatch spends an inordinate amount of time reminding you of your characters body and the ways in which it collides with the natural world you need to navigate through, and yet your body is no less impervious and superlative than any given video game character. Firewatch wants you to watch your character scramble a rock wall, but also won’t deny you an endless sprint button so as to not trouble you with the need to spend any extraneous time walking through the landscape. It wants you to feel dazed as Henry slips down a slope, but worry not about dropping off that ledge, a perfect landing is always assured.\n\nThese are small things in context, but when so much of Firewatch is attempting to break away from the conventions of traditional game design they stand out as inexplicable reminders that underneath the narrative this still a fairly ordinary and unexceptional game. And that realization causes the act of actually playing Firewatch to often feel like a chore; a simple but tedious and obligatory gesture done purely for the sake of narrative.\n\nAnd if playing Firewatch is uninteresting to the degree I would simply rather not, what purpose then do the vast and beautiful landscapes serve beyond extensive gaps between story beats I’m forced to run through. When Firewatch neglects to make the act of actually playing it engaging in its own right, it creates no desire to spend any extra time within its world because everything outside of the story is deemed less important.\n\nIt isn’t even that this isn’t a world I would like to appreciate, as meandering about its trees and hills so perfectly captures the feeling of being lost within the wilderness that I wouldn’t feel opposed to merely trapesing through a nestle of trees for no other reason than to watch how the light breaks through them. Firewatch is exceptional in its artistic direction and each frame could be captured and displayed as a beautiful painting in its own right. But by creating a hierarchy of purpose between its gameplay and narrative Firewatch causes time spent outside of its story to feel wasted, or at the very least as if you are holding the game up from showing you what it really wants to. It wasn’t long before I lost most of my desire to just take in the world I was walking through, as I felt constantly funneled from one story beat to the next and couldn’t shake the feeling of idleness anytime I’d stop to admire a particularly lovely vista.\n\nFirewatch’s strength lies in its simplicity and humanity. Its uncompromising narrative is often deeply frustrating, but in crafting a world so completely mundane and ordinary populated with messy problems without easy answer, it manages to tap into a specific segment of the human experience so rarely explored in games. It’s unfortunate its mechanical foundation is so much less unexpected and disrupting, coming close at times to taking the rest of the game down with it as Firewatch’s two conflicting halves struggle to find any sort of balance. In the end its problems aren’t all that different from the wildfire that springs up early on in the game. They’re always there and keep getting bigger, but we just ignore them and hope they’ll be dealt with before the whole place goes up in flames.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 4","true","3.9"," 65 of 82 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","65","82","4","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/recommended/383870/","el_kemosabe","El Kemosabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/","1115 products in account","A great premise, fantastic voice acting and a beautiful setting, sounds like the perfect game, right? Wrong.\nFirewatch is a “single-player first-person mystery” otherwise known as a walking simulator with dialogue. In Firewatch you play as Henry, a middle-aged man who has volunteered to be a lookout in the Shoshone National Park, Wyoming during one summer in the late 80s. The beginning of the game sets up his story in the form of a ‘text adventure’ in which the game describes a few key events which you’ll need to know to understand Henry. Once you get to the Shoshone part of the game you begin speaking to your supervisor, Delilah, who talks you through your summer job as well as chatting to you about a few things. You’re usually given three dialogue options when talking to Delilah which will change the path of the conversation (though not the game as far as I can tell) though sometimes you’ll only get one option, usually if you’re reporting something. Having been excited about Firewatch since the first trailers of it were released I was incredibly excited to get my hands on it but unfortunately I’ve been left rather disappointed.\n\nPlease note: The game took me three hours to beat, any game time further than that has either been spent getting the trading card drops or going back to unlock the first two achievements which were broken when I started the game.\n\nFirewatch has two main strong points, its appearance and its voice acting. First up, appearance. Firewatch is positively beautiful, even on low settings as I played it on. While it’s not a unique aesthetic, as some have said it looks a tad similar to The Long Dark, it fits the game well and when there’s something like a sunset it can be quite breath-taking.\n\nLike I said, the voice acting is also fantastic. The actors who played Henry and Delilah did a fantastic job at making two believable characters and a lot of their dialogue feels real. There were a couple of bits here and there which were a bit weaker but nothing major enough to take away from how good it was.\n\nMoving on, we have gameplay, or in Firewatch’s case, lack thereof. It is, as has been said by others, pretty much just a walking simulator and if you’re a fan of walking simulators then that’s great, sadly I’m not. There are a couple of things to do other than walking, for example there are certain places were you need to repel down steep slopes, but the vast majority of the game is taken up by just walking around. This is made worse by the fact that there are a few points in the game where you have to backtrack or walk through an area you’ve already been through, it just makes walking through said areas even less interesting. While the bigger areas are pretty dull, especially the familiar ones, there are some areas in the game which are pretty cool and actually enjoyable to explore, they’re all tied to the story so don’t worry about missing them. Admittedly I’m not sure how they could have added any real gameplay to the game but I do think that Firewatch would have been more suited to a different format, i.e. a novel. The interactions between Henry and Delilah are definitely the best parts of the game, the longer interactions anyway, but these interactions are usually on either side of a chunk of walking in silence, which is as boring as it sounds.\n\nFirewatch’s story starts out strong, really strong and for the most part it’s very well-written, made even better by the voice actors. Even the little text adventure at the beginning is great, it sets up the character of Henry incredibly well and it’s also like an emotional punch to the gut. The story carries on strong as Henry eases in to his summer job with some simple tasks given to him by Delilah. Sadly things take a turn for the worse when Henry discovers something he probably wishes he hadn’t and Henry and Delilah are catapulted into a rather worrying situation. The story actually remains pretty strong until you get to the end of the game at which point I found myself presented with one of the most disappointing endings I’ve encountered in story-driven games as well as in novels. There’s simply no pay-off for beating the game, I honestly think I would have enjoyed the game a lot more if they’d just cut the last twenty or thirty minutes from what is already a disappointingly short game for the price (just for the record I would have been happy with the six hours the devs said it would be before release but three hours is too short for £15 in my opinion). Without any plot spoilers I’ll explain why I don’t like the ending a little more: the problem with the ending is that it feels forced, like the devs ran out of time so they just threw something in there to tie it up nicely. Except, it doesn’t tie it up nicely, it ends with so many unanswered questions that even the characters, who have just gone through this pretty alarming experience, don't care about. In the final interaction between the two before the credits roll they act like nothing has happened at all and it made the three hours I spent playing the game feel so pointless. I didn’t get the sense of closure I want from story-driven games.  There is also a pretty major whole in the plot. Once you get to the end of the game and piece things together there's one thing in particular which just doesn't make sense, something that should have been addressed in the game.\n\nVerdict\nAt the end of the day, Firewatch is little more than another overpriced walking simulator. While the story is great for most of the game the ending completely and utterly ruined the experience for me which just made it harder to look past the distinct lack of interesting gameplay. Grab it on a deep discount if you like story-driven games and don’t mind a disappointing ending but at full price I can’t recommend this game.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","February 13","false","4.6"," 851 of 1,329 people (64%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","64","851","1","21","49"

For a game that lasted only 3.7h to complete i find 19,99$/€ price point too high. I Don't see particularry very high replay value either, while the exploration is key part of the game there is nothing to really do as in side quests or collectibles laying around the map that you could search for.\n\nStory is rather fine, but the end result can be dissapointing same goes for the ending. I think the game gives some type of an illusion for different outcomes that can happen depending what you do or say, but overall i do feel there is so much that could have done with the story or just prolonged it pretty much.\n\nI also do want to point out that gamepad button mapping could have been better. Zooming and keep map open at same time was annoying, there could have been toggle feature or something.\n\nIt's a good buy if you get for under ~10$ but other than that its not worth the money since i felt i kinda got ripped off by such a short game. I also felt stuff like physics engine was rather waste since it didn't bring much to the gameplay nor did the camera system.","February 9","false","4.0"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","91","42","46","16","0"

Your wife Julia is sick with Dementia and moves back to Australia. You want to escape from everything and you decide to become a volunteer and become a firewatcher. When you arrive at your outpost you meet a woman named Delilah who is gonna be the only person you talk to through the entire game. You never see her and the only way to talk to her is through your trusty radio. The game also has a sub plot, but I'll cover that a bit tad later.\n\nThe dialogue between Henry and Delilah is my favorite part of the game. It feels very natural how they talk between each other and I feel like that helps a lot with the game.\n\nFirewatch is a walking simulator and a very bare bones one at that. The game takes place over a period of 79 days ( you don't play through all of them) where you explore the forest. When you explore the forest you can sometimes find stuff that have an icon of a radio next to them and you can talk about that stuff to Delilah and maybe spark up a conversation that will reveal the more about Delilah or Henry. The game also lets you explore the entire map at your own pace, so if you want to wander off and explore you are free to do so, but Delilah will drop in once in a while to remind you what you're supposed to be doing.\n\nThe graphics are absolutely outstanding. The entire environment looks absolutely gorgeous and it's breathtaking just to go to the highest point in the map and look around at the sights which are all just amazing. The entire forest feels alive as the trees sway with the wind and the sounds of the wilderness help to build the perfect atmosphere.\n\nThe soundtrack is also amazing, when you explore the music sometimes changes to somber music to stuff that will creep you out a bit, it's all very good and definitely worth owning the soundtrack.\n\nAlright now I'm going to the territory of stuff that I thought were really bizarre and downright poorly executed.\n\nThe texture problems in later sections of the game really are just not good and break you out of the game as soon as you see them. Also the frequent frame drops happen quite often in the end game section. Also the ending is very out of place and happens way too soon.\n\nThe game took me 3 hours to finish and I took my time off and explored the forest and not to mention I got lost quite a lot during my play time.\n\nAlright here is the problem I had with the plot so *SPOILER WARNING*\n\nAlright the two subplots with the missing girls and the stalker are very mediocre. First the missing girl subplot has one of the worst wraps up I have ever seen. The game sort of expects you that the stalker did something to them, but it later turns out that they were messing around somewhere else which I thought was cheap.\n\nThe stalker storyline has a very nice buildup, but the ending for the subplot felt very out of place and very weird with in tone of the rest of the game. Thinking you will end up with a satisfying conclusion the game lets you down right at the end.\n\n*SPOILER WARNING OVER*\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with Firewatch. While I don't think it's worth the full price at a discount I can safely say you can check this game out.\n\nFinal Rating:\n7.5/10 - Great game, but only on a discount\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","February 26","true","3.1"," 82 of 110 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","82","110","4","0"

If you've bought the game already, please play it before you read on.\n\nEver since Firewatch was announced, and I saw the first 15 minutes of this game being shown off by the developers, I fell in love with what looked like GOTY potential. The voice acting was natural, the hiking looked seamless and free, and the story looked like it would blossom into something really worth investing my time and money into.\n\nWhen I finally loaded up my game after giddily waiting for a solid day for it to release, every expectation was met as I happily hiked around the beautiful forests of Wyoming, seeking ferocious fires and confiscating beers and fireworks from rebellious teens. There is no question that Campo Santo put a lot of effort into creating a stunning environment to lose yourself in, with the colourful canyons and trickling streams along with the incredibly fresh dialouge from the games protagonist and his lookout counterpart.\n\nSo why in the WORLD would I not recommend this game?\n\nFirewatch lights a match at its beginning, throws it into a bundle of kindling and by the half way mark a raging bonfire stands before you, hurling paranoia and interesting plot developments that leave you gagging to know what comes next. But before you can huddle around the flame to envelop yourself in what feels like what's going to be a gut wrenching journey of conspiracy and mystery, the fire dies and leaves you cold and confused.\n\nWhile the storytelling is superb, the execution of the conclusion is left to be desired. It frustratingly falls short in the end and I felt like the REAL ending would jump out at me when I least expected it... but it didn't. I had to sit there and ponder "is this it?".\n\nMaybe that's the kicker. Maybe that was the goal. Maybe I was meant to feel the paranoia of the characters in the game and that it was all in my head too, but it was such an uninteresting ending I just felt like there was some serious wasted potential with this title and it really, really disappoints me after the first two thirds are almost perfect for the set up of something that seemed so much bigger than the characters; a real thrilling mystery to be solved.\n\nIf the game was more around the £8 mark, I would probably just say go ahead and get it, but with the story falling short for me it was also only around 5 hours long (I'm even seeing people completing it in 3). It's a shame.","February 9","false","5.4"," 300 of 458 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","300","458","7","0"

I have rated this game a 'No' reluctantly.\n\nLet's start with the positives - The characters are realistic. The dialogue is superb. The voice acting is absolutely spot on and the story starts off making it hard to stop playing because you desperately want to know what happens next. Getting into character just naturally happens. That combined with the pretty scenery, the sound effects that sometimes leave you feeling like you are being followed through the forests, and the perfect minimalist music to set the mood as events happen in the game made it very immersive and got my imagination going into overdrive.\n\nUnfortunately the story suddenly just nose dives and all the sudden it's the end of the game. One moment you are worried every single time you climb a rock face that you will run into someone you don't want to run into at the top, or that something will happen to your rope as you repel down sheer rockfaces. You panic that someone is right behind you or just in front of you constantly... And then all the sudden it's game over. So much tension had been built only for it to end so suddenly and so unsatisfactorily. It felt like the boss poked his head into the writers office and just told them to wrap it up and that they had 10 minutes to do it in.\n\nThat is something they could fix if they wanted to though... They could expand it a bit more. Perhaps add another hour of game play or some interesting side-quests... So I rate this a No at the moment and it sort of pains my heart to do so.","February 15","false","7.8"," 148 of 216 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","148","216","4","2"

The interactions between Henry and Delilah were extremely well done and the animations were flawless (Which I'm always saying that animations are more important than good graphics). Unfortunately, the game suffers in the fact that I beat it in 3 hours, even when I was taking my time getting as much dialogue as possible and even got lost and backtracked several times across the entire map and back. The plot is kind of disappointing. Without spoilers, the build-up was suspensful, but the reveal was absolute trash. The story feels rushed after the halfway mark. I'd say that it wasn't worth a $20 dollar price tag. I wish that they did more with the story. The choices for a while felt like that they mattered, but toward the end, it was completely shrugged off to wrap it up quickly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harukiki3/recommended/383870/","Harukiki3","Harukiki3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harukiki3/","122 products in account","Firewatch is tagged with “the walking-simulator games”, like the game Gone Home. (which unfortunately I did not find engaging) But I have to say I had a very good time playing the Firewatch. The game has fully lived up to my expectation despite its relatively short playtime and to me, Firewatch resembles a post-modernism novel in telling people a story and unfolding the plot and the ending. Here are my thoughts.\n\nThe game started with a script-choosing prologue, providing the basic background of the story (basically about the early life before our protagonist, Henry). I found this part very immersive for the simple dialogue choosing mechanism and the relaxing background music, the characters are all very relatable and the twist in Henry’s early life made my tears welling up :( It is just ordinary people’s life, but it proved to be moving, especially when this initial part only took up about 15-20 minutes to present Henry’s whole life before he went to the wilderness to be a fire lookout. It was such a climatic experience and after this initial part the gamers should have a basic, yet ambiguous understanding of why Henry took this job.\n\nThe main gameplay of the game is fairly good, first the mechanism of walkie-talkie is really brilliant idea, as the name puts, it allows you to report many thing you see to your supervisor, Delilah, which you do not feel lonely while exploring the wilderness. To make this mechanism work, the voice acting is essential and it is just fascinating. The navigation system---the map and the compass combination is very interesting and works well. The major problem I have with this game is the performance, the game has glitches during the autosave when you move to the next region, and the game requires high spec for its grass&trees rendering and shadows. There are many invisible walls in the game, which breaks my immersion sometimes.\n\nTo the end of the game, some people found it “anticlimactic” and frustrating about the short 4-5 hrs playtime to “complete” it. Personally I disagree with these opinions. The longevity of the time never justifies a game when the quality is below average. This game is all about imagination, people nowadays are easily become disconcerting when something strange happened, especially for gamers (or Hollywood movie fans) who has taken it for granted that---there has to be a climax, many conspiracies and lots of twists in game’s story. The fact is, what the developers want to tell is a small episode of life involving only several character(Actually the number is 6, according to the cast list) and I think they have done a good job. There is no survival mechanism (like the one we have in The Long Dark), there is no death or failure penalty. Yet I found myself overreacting to some thrilling elements and then it turned out to be just my imagination.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<Spoiler Alert>\nAs for the ending, yes you never actually get to meet Delilah, which is acceptable in my opinion, in the game, when you get into her tower in the end, you can found her sketch of you, which was completed only by the descriptions of how you look through radio times ago in the game. I definitely think that everyone has his/her very own image of Delilah, and so again this is a game about creativity of human thoughts, which is imagination. So I do not think the game has a mundane ending.\n\nPersonally I may play the game for several times in the future, Firewatch is more like a good book of fiction to me.If you are into readings, you shall find that the style of story’s beginning, unfolding and ending is quite close to the post-modernism. In this category, we have Murakami Haruki with 1Q84, Lisa Genova with Still Alice Jonathan Safran Foer with Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and so on. These books, they all offered readers a basic yet vague setting, people HAVE TO use imagination to understand, to engage. The ending will not surprise you that much, but that is the real life. In the Firewatch, the same applied, maybe you can be sure to expect the ending exactly in the middle of the game, but there are still many things remains unexplored, many choice to reply to the supervisors I would like to try out. Firewatch is the very game for the late night reading time, it is immersive in the first playthrough and it shall be more of a casual journey from then on. I have already decided to close the captions in next playthrough for more immersion :)\n\nPros:\n-Immersive story and gameplay\n-Amazing voice acting\n-Beautiful art style (just check community screenshots)\n-Great original soundtracks (Highly recommended! Including FLAC & MP3 version)\nCons:\n-Performance (frame rates drops sometimes)\n-Relatively a high requirement for hardware as an indie game\nRecommended especially to those:\n-who loves AVG or Telltales series\n-who loves Life is Strange for art style","February 16","true","5.7"," 70 of 93 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","70","93","2","0"

Wait for the next sale.\nAfter the trailers, I was hyped for this game. I expected an open-world mystery / adventure game set in the middle of nowhere. What you get is essentially a linear walking simulator with nice art assets.\n\nWhat looks like an open world is limited everywhere by obstacles that require a specific tool. Since you apparently did not think to bring literally anything with you, you have to collect ropes, an axe, and climbing gear when the story dictates it. This severly limits the places you can go / explore.\nAnd even if you decide to go exploring, the only thing you can find are the supply-caches, which are marked on your map from the first minute; those usually contain a letter from someone you don't know, to someone you don't care about; writing about how they want to drink beer.\n\nThe radio is the only thing giving you a degree of choice, or the illusion of it. Often, you will be given a Telltale Games kind-of choice between 3 options of what to say, with a ~10 second timer counting down. Unlike Telltale however, these choices have 0 impact on the story and outcome of the game. You could remove the radio entirely from the game and end up with a genuine walking simulator, where you spend 10% of your time staring at the map, and the other 90% walking to the place, the map tells you to go.\n\nThis leaves the story as the only thing holding this game together, and while it starts out very intriguing, in my opinion it falls flat on its face near the end. I won't spoil anything, since this would ruin the game completely for you, but once you know the big twist at the end, the game has nothing more to offer you. This also leads to 0 replayability; I don't think anyone will ever play this game a second time.\n\nTo summarize: If you manage to stay unspoiled until the next sale, where the price drops below 50%, and if you enjoy the occasional walking simulator, then go for it. Otherwise, those 20€ could be invested alot better.","February 9","false","3.6"," 353 of 561 people (63%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","63","353","561","18","16"

The voice acting was great and so were the characters. The graphical aesthetic was colourful and immersive. The music was subtle and excellent.\n\nThe problem lies with one specific important element that Firewatch is missing: it's not a game. I never felt like I was actually doing anything or participating in the story in any meaningful way. None of my choices seemed to make a difference - which is the entire point of telling a story through the medium of a video game. If this were a movie, it'd be a fairly decent movie. However, it isn't a movie. I spent about 50% of the game running from point to point while staring at the map. 30% was spent doing stuff that the game wanted me to do (click this. break that. pick that up. radio that object in). 20% was making small talk over the radio (arguably the best part of the game). This game suffers from 'tutorialitis.' I felt as though I was on rails and being babied every step of the way. It becomes an absurd experience when I realise that I'm a robotic function of the game. That is to say, I'm not controlling the game but the game is controlling me. It's like doing a series of QTEs but without the 'Q'.\n\nWith that said, I didn't expect challenge from this game. I did expect a story focused experience, which it was. Yet, the story was disappointing. As other reviewers have pointed out, nothing seems to be of any consequence. The stakes are raised in the middle of the game and then immediately fizzle. Every bad thing that could happen to the protagonist is reversed with absolutely no input from the protagonist. Imagine this: The rebels are about to take off in their spaceships to shoot the Death Star core, when suddenly the Death Star just blows up on its own from a malfunction. What's the point of creating obstacles that solve themselves? Is it some sort of message about futility or is it just lazy writing?\n\nI want to like this game and as I said to begin with there are a lot of enjoyable aspects to this game. However, for the price, the core of the game simply isn't worth it. I would recommend it only on a 50% - 75% sale. I would like to see more from this developer because I can tell they're passionate and they tried to do something unique but it just didn't work very well for me.\n\n","February 10","false","3.4"," 92 of 135 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","92","135","0","0"

I saw it on sale for about $16 the day before it's release. I remember seing the E3 presentation of the game and thought "Hey, seems like it could be a nice mystery game with decent decision making that would effect the outcome along with some rather pleasent to listen to voice acting". So I had an interest in this title. But, did it fare to my expectations? Nope. Here's why.\n\nNow I am going to avoid spoilers, because I respect that some will want to give this a shot themselves, but I strongly recommend waiting for a sale. Like $5.00 sale.\n\nI'm going to start off with the pros, because despite my over-all disappointed there are some commendable attributes.\n\nPros:\n+Voice acting - This is definitly the golden prize of the game. Interactions between Henry (Rich Sommer) and Delilah (Cissy Jones) are engaging and rather entertaining. It definilty does a good job and genuinely making you feel involved in the characters relationship.\n\n+Soundtrack - The ambient acoustic guitar throughout the game never got tedious and kept me enthralled and quite relaxed.\n\n+Art Style - A rather pretty lookng game, I definilty sense heavy inspiration of Team Fortress 2 especially in player model (A modded asset from Team Fortress 2). Environment is pretty to look at. But ultimately feels kind of lifeless.\n\n+Story (Acts one and two) The sense of mystery surrounding the game specifically in the first two acts,  definilty made a rather intense on-the-egde of your seat impact. It was what drove me to keep playing till the end. But, this is where I get into the cons.\n\nCons:\n-Not enough depth - I thoroughly enjoyed the first 40 minutes of playing. I initially felt the game could've had a lot to offer in terms of exploration. I mean, look at the map when you first get into the lookout. It seams plentiful, like there'd be a lot to find and discover. But unfortunately there's northing really to keep from following the rather linear pathway to keep the story rolling. I didn't get the flashlight till near the end of the game and I pretty much didn't even need  it.\n\n-Lifeless - When you start off and come across an Elk and then a  tree scratched to ♥♥♥♥ by a Grizzly, I thought "Huh, maybe there'll be an encounter with a Grizzly". Nope. Asside from the gran-total 3 npcs to come across, there is very little wildlife present in these woods. Even though the game warns of these encounters, they never occure. Ever.\n\n-Length - Having finished the game in only 3 hours, I finally understand Angry Joes contempt for short ♥♥♥ titles, I've often avoided them because they aren't worth the asking price. I honesltly hoped this would've been a bit longer. 8 - 9 hours atleast.\n\n-Illusion of choice - One thing the game did interestingly was the choices of dialogue between Henry and Delilah but ultimiately this was meaningless and has little impact on end-game. Even the text based intro makes no difference whatsoever except for a naked sketch of you depending on how you choose pose. That's it.\n\n-Ending sucked - A game presented like this, at least could've had multiple endings.... There's only two and they're both exactly the ♥♥♥♥ing same.\n\nAll in all, I give this game a 4 out of 10. It's not really worth $20, if on sale for like $5:00 and you enjoy dialogue heavy games then maybe give it a shot. But for the most part, it's pretty "meh".\n","February 11","false","3.6"," 87 of 127 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","87","127","0","0"

The presentation, voice acting, map design is top notch. There's clearly a lot of work and care that went into crafting the world of the game. And it starts off well enough. A powerful intro, followed by an interesting premise.\n\nSadly, the game drops off fairly quickly from the halfway point. The game's excellent atmosphere and dialogue from the opening takes a hit in the favor of a mystery-driven plot that unfortunately isn't very good in the slightest. It has its moments, but the payoff is ultimately non-existant, and the game ends on a whimper. I suppose the twist is here that... there really isn't any.\n\nThe game gives you the illusion of choices but ultimately they count for nothing in the outcome of the story. This is not really an issue, but it's worth pointing out, because this also means the game has little to no replay value. And despite what the developers claimed(6 hours long game), the game can be completed under 4 hours at normal pace. Of course, you could say, well, why not go explore? Why, of course, that sounds like a great idea! Except, there's not much to see, if anything at all. The game already shows off its best vistas and sights to you by just playing the story itself. And apart from that, there's nothing. No wildlife, no other people, no nothing.\n\nOverall, I expected more. I expected a more interesting story, and a more involved gameplay scenario. The game drops the whole idea of you being a park ranger way too quickly, and shoehorns a mystery arc in there that is about as interesting as a CSI episode. The presentation though, once again, beautiful. And great soundtrack, too.","February 9","false","3.5"," 64 of 89 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","64","89","0","0"

No spoilers below.\nI am absolutely stunned at how this game managed to come out without more hype. I was looking through the Steam store a few days ago and noticed the nice yellow logo with the words "FIREWATCH" on it. I thought it'd be some sort of FPS or maybe another survival game. I figured I should give it a look, after watching 2 minutes of gameplay I immediately said F**K it, and purchased the game.\n\nI only have an hour in the game so far, I'll edit the review in the future to add more information, however this game has already entertained me on a rollercoaster of emotions to the point that I feel like leaving a review alrready. I usually don't leave reviews for games until I have a respectable amount of time in them. This game is too great for me to not recommend it after only playing for an hour.\n\nLiterally five minutes into the game and I'm already on the verge of tears. The dialogue in this game is just so great, you can genuinely hear the range of emotions from both primary characters. You can hear the constant sarcasm in their remarks, and that they care about doing the job they do.\n\nVisually this game is absolutely stunning, again I have no idea how there wasn't more hype for this piece of art. Every direction you look you always manage to spot scenery that you could print, frame, and hang. I'm running this game on a 980 Ti at ultra settings, and my jaw drops at the amazing views you get in this game.\n\nStorywise I am already hooked. Just the first 5 minutes managed to get me emotionally and physically engaged in the game. I don't think I can handle playing anyother game until I am able to reach a conclusion to this game and get some closure.\n\nCampo Santo is going to be a developer that I will very closely watch. If the next acts of this game are as great as the first, I will blindly pre-order this developer's next game based solely on merit.\n\nFor now I will leave a rating of 9/10 based solely on the introduction of the game (Day 1). Once I complete the game I will further update my review, however if you're looking for storygames that play out like the Telltale games, but the freedom of a first person story-based exploration game, then this game was made with you in mind. Usually Triple A titles make it to my Game of the Year list, however sometimes an indie game manages to sneak in there. This game is currently the game to beat on my GOTY list. I expect it to be the runner-up, if not, the winner of this year for me.\n\nThis game is a MUST-buy.","February 9","true","4.0"," 399 of 645 people (62%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","62","399","645","37","7"

A one time Australian girlfriend. Alfred Hitchcock films in brilliant Technicolor. These are things that made indelible fingerprints on my past. And almost eerily Campbo Santo Games has brought these things together in a small minimalist game that despite its lack of a ten million dollar budget hooked me right in like I’m sure Doom 2016 will. The game starts subtle enough, you are Henry, a man escaping a bad episode (or two) in his life by taking a summer job as one of those guys who man a firetower and watch for forest fires. The woods are breezy, picturesque, calm, and inviting.\n\nThrough the first quarter of the game a mystery begins unfolding and the woods turn sinister. The excellent sound design made me swear I could hear twigs cracking not far behind me and I found myself constantly turning around thinking someone was watching me. The only real foothold I had, the anchor which prevented panic mode was the voice on the other end of the walkie-talkie I had with me. That voice belonged to Delilah, my boss, a chick residing in another fire tower six miles away. Ah, Delilah, truly one of the most compelling characters I’ve ever encountered in over twenty years of PC gaming.\n\nA part of me wanted the game to rush to its ending just to see my relationship with Delilah come to its fruition. Playing this hit me though, reminding me just like in real life it’s the journey not the destination. I think this is a realization shared by many who played this game and criticized the Henry/Delilah relationship aspect of it. When I finally made my way to Delilah’s firetower and my perceptions of her came face to face with her humble abode where she had often communicated with me on the radio, I found it strangely overwhelming.\n\nThe mystery istelf, slightly underwhelming. It reminded me of something out of a Lifetime movie. It was nothing grandiose popping out bigger than life, just a simple plausible unsettling event that any one of us could potentially find ourselves enmeshed in.\n\nI don’t often replay games, the ones I have I can count on one hand; I probably will replay this one someday. Its beautiful art style prompted a screenshot. I rarely post screenshots since I consider them spoilers, and seriously, if I go back and play Crysis again, do I really need to pollute your Steam activity feed with screenies of a 2007 game? You already know what the game looks like. But I couldn’t help myself. The art style was redolent of those woods on my grandparents’ farm I mentioned earlier. That part of the game was truly a venture into my past.\n\nThe game was really short, but adequate. I completed it in just under five hours, and that’s probably longer than most. There is one consolation, stay the course and the achievements are free gimmies. It’s one of the easiest 100% achievement games I’ve played. The sour point was how the ending seemed somewhat rushed. It was if some corporate bean counter was cracking the whip to get it completed and out the door. It begs the question, is the game worth it for the asking price? I enjoyed it immensely. Don’t let it pass you by, especially during a summer or winter sale.","May 6","true","5.0"," 69 of 98 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","69","98","2","4"

If you do decide to buy it, take the time to look at everything you see. You'll spend about 30 mins to an hour more and it will be worth it for sure. As I mention in my (spoiling) comment below, (more spoilers:) I think the ending would've been better if it would've been like the start of the game: in story mode.

First of all, this is a great looking game.  It tells the story very well and it kept my interest for the most of the time i played it.

Seriously.  The story, while engaging at first, becomes a hollow cop out in the end in my opinion.  Not to mention the little to no replay value and about 3 hours of game play to complete.  If money isnt an issue, i still take the side of this game didn't get a proper thought of the story it told and the conclusion it arrived at.  You'll definately see what I mean by that if you pick this one up.  Nice build up, enjoyable story to follow, lack luster ending.

The dialogue is well written in most cases and the voice actors succeed well in portraying a sense of urgency or just humour depending on the situation.\n\nThe problems however ruin most of these positives. The story feels like it falls flat on its face in the closing hour. I finished the game feeling unsatisfied with what I've learned of it's twists and turns.

The art is really neat and looks great for what it is. The music is captivating and goes great with the setting. That being said, the plot falls short. I felt like I was playing "Explore the Woods Simulator 2016" more than a mystery game. Sure there is a mystery but it never really is explained it kind of just develops out of nowhere. One minute you are at point A. and suddenly you are at Z with very little in between. It was frightening to play thinking that there was more to come but it just never happened. The most intense moment in the game is a semi stealthy exploration of an unchartered camp which, in reality, isn't even a threatening part of the game. I was giddy in the middle. I felt like the game might have a scooby doo ending where theres a villian behind everything trying to scare away people to secure his treasure or something silly, but it didn't even come close to that. In fact, you never even really encounter a villian. Like I said, its a decent game, not worth $17 though. Maybe grab it on sale and kocnk it out one day.

Let's dive right in then!\n\nFirst of all, the more mudane aspect of it - the game has been continuously advertised by devs as a game that runs for around 6 hours. I explored nearly every inch of its barren, lifeless, boring map, took 83 screenshots while doing it and finished it in 4.5 hours. I was reassured that if I took my time and took in the sights I could easily extend the experience well over those 6 hours. This is simply put a lie.\n\n"A beautiful wilderness environment that expands as you explore" - this is again a lie. The map consists entirely of walled-off tunnel-like paths with pretty vistas.\n\n"Secrets and discoveries to be made over every hill" - there is quite literally nothing of interest in any corner of the map that is not directly related to the plot line. Exploring the few spots where the maps opens up a little yields quite literally nothing that is of any importance or that is even mildly interesting.\n\n"An edge-of-your-seat mystery" - The so-called mystery runs for about two and a half hours in the mid-point of the game and is replaced by the biggest plotline bait-and-switch disappointment I ever experienced, swapping the non-existent "mystery" with a soppy, poorly explained and poorly put together sob story.\n\nTo top it all off, the game runs on Unity, which means you get the full bonus package that goes with every first-person Unity game ever - poor performance, flickering shadows that pop in and out, non-existent antialiasing, getting caught up on every little piece of world geometry placed on the ground, flat lighting, the works.\n\nWhile I admire the creative vision of the art team and realize they did their utmost to create a pretty, immersive environment, they simply lost the unwinnable fight with Unity.\n\nThe best thing you can do with this is wait until it appears in the mid-tier of some upcoming Humble Bundle - something I imagine will happen before 2016 is over - and give it a go for the average price of a dollar, so you can snap some pleasant wallpaper backgrounds and see for yourself just how cheeky developers can get, hyping up and falsely advertising a game that is a disappointment on multiple levels.","February 10","false","6.7"," 79 of 119 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","79","119","4","5"

There wasnt much to the choice aspect of the game. I completed it once and would never touch again. 4 hours of time is not worth $20. The story was good on the front end, but not at the end. The gameplay was ok, I learned how to use a compass at least. The graphics were not very pretty, but it ran well. Graphics wise it didn't look like it was first person. I looked a little bit blocky and there was little activites to do execpt for follow a narrow, unaltered by player choice, semi-uniteresting, storyline that was way too open-ended. Overall the game was just ok, worth about $10 to 7$. Wait for a sale on this one, I felt totally ripped off after only 4 hours of play time and it being over.

You won't miss anything from the experience.\n\n"Bad things happen, and you have to find a way to contain the damage, a good way." - Delilah ~ Firewatch\n\nI am taking the advice you gave me, Campo Santo's writers. I don't think you will like the result.\n\nWhat is a bad thing that could happen? Paying more than $5 for this game.\nWhat is a good way to contain the damage? Me warning all of you.\n\nThe mystery is compelling, until you find out. Then you regret being sucked in. No spoilers, but it is majorly anti-climatic.\nThe 2 lead characters are interesting, until you find out that this follows the bad part of the TellTale formula. None of your choices matter in the slightest, for any meaningful plot/character development. Even worse, there is no real resolution that is worth mentioning.\n\nFirewatch not only lacks all meaningful plot/character development, but ultimately lacks an interesting story. It is as if they thought what they were creating was going to be profound, or transcendent. If they would have spent their time writing something that was good, then it could have resulted in being profound, transcendent, or at the very least being worth the asking price.\n\nSeriously, don't spend more than $5 on this game. It's too late for my refund, but I can stop you from making my mistake. This is the bad kind of walking simulator. It's nowhere near The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, The Wolf Among Us, or The Walking Dead.\n\nYou can tell that the programming was done by a hack from DoubleFine. There is no reason for this game to be this unoptimized.","February 10","false","6.1"," 140 of 231 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","140","231","0","13"

However I am disappointed to say the game is short in length, high in price and has an anticlimactic end.\n\nBefore you start your first person adventure in the Wyoming wilderness you are introduced to yourself, well the 30 year old man you are going to become. It's strange to think how well you can feel for this character after just simple decision making and text based scenarios, and this is one of the things Firewatch does well, you can bond with every character even the ones you know very little about.\nYou learn about you life leading to the time you take the job; A Firewatch - you monitor the forest from a tower named 'Two Forks'.\n\nThe person you will spend most of your time talking with (Over Walkie Talkie) is your boss, or superior, a women named Delilah. She is there throughout your whole journey as you connect the dots and explore the amazing landscapes of the Wilderness from lush wood lands, to majestic meadows and the amazing natural wonder this game has to offer.\n\nHowever...\nEven though this game is one that I couldn't stop playing until I had finished it has it's issues.\nAs many other reviews say, this game cost me £14.99 ($21.76 and 19.34 - This isn't exact as I used Google to convert the exact amount.) and only lasted me 3hrs, yes 3hrs. I didn't play fast as I didn't always follow my mission straight away, I often took the time to look around at this games wonderful art and speak with Delilah as the conversations are realistic and brilliantly acted.\nAnother negative, even though you often have to choose your own dialogue there's no consequences, the game didn't take a different turn due to what I said and as a result it has no replay value.\n\nOverall I loved the experience but I do not agree with the price. I feel some issues could be fixed with free DLC (even though I can't see how this is possible, and could ruin what has already been made) or a lower price tag, this would be the better option. I would recommend this game, if you are willing to pay a large amount for a small game, even though I feel the storyline came to an anticlimax it is still a great build up and has a strong mystery and im still thinking about it and wanting to talk about it now, that to me is a good game overall and maybe it does last longer than you think.\n\nPersonal rating:\n8/10","February 12","true","3.1"," 138 of 228 people (61%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","61","138","228","6","1"

In fact, it might be one of the best games of its kind. That is, to say, essentially a walking simulator with pretty visuals and an interesting plot. One thing that had me hyped for this game was the talent surrounding it. Jake Rodkin and Sean Vannaman of Telltale Games team up with other creatives such as Jane Ng and Olly Moss to create a beautifully intricate world.\n\nThere were so many times in the game that I had to stop to drink in the view and take a few screenshots (you can find them on my profile, there are very light spoilers). The game's mysterious plot was engaging and I definitely felt the urge to keep going especially when I wanted to take a break. This is, unfortunately, one of the game's flaws: it's too short for what it tries to do. The entire game is only about 3 or 4 hours in length. I finished it in a single sitting and I kind of wish there was a bit more in there. I'm not saying add a lot of filler content, nobody likes that, however I do think there should have been a bit more 'gameplay' - something to make the player think or feel engaged. Otherwise, they're just playing an interactive movie.\n\nVisuals, sound, controls etc. - it's all fantastic. One of my favourite experiences in a video game. It's quite early to tell but I think it's going to be very popular among fans of walking simulator games. However, with the £15 price tag for only 3 hours of content I would suggest waiting for a sale or price drop. I hope it does get one eventually because it's a great experience. I'm looking forward to future projects that Campo Santo embark on!","February 13","false","4.7"," 206 of 347 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","206","347","6","0"

So why the thumbs down?\n\nI don't mind a "game-that-is-not-a-game". I don't mind a very short playtime. But I like my walking simulators to actually bring a provoking story or setting to the table. And Firewatch simply did not deliver for me in the end. It failed to deliver the main thing I was looking for... (just like Gone Home btw).\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\n\n\n\n\nI really liked that the story in the end wasn't about a big conspiracy, but two (three) flawed characters and simple human tragedy. However, the story being grounded in reality is no excuse for delivering such a muted ending. The setup for an amazing catharsis for both Henry and Delilah was there: however, we ended with some more walking, an empty lookout and a helicopter. I don't really know what I would've wanted instead... but perhaps a bit more resolution and closure. A proper epilogue, I don't know. I get that it's one of the things the game is selling: that real life is not (always) an exiting adventure and that you can't always get what you want. However, I this is also a story, and I am experiencing stories to be moved, to get a different view or to be inspired. Firewatch, in the end, just gave me a really beautiful journey.

You and your trusty sidekick who is only available to guide you through your walkie talkie must get to the bottom of this.\n\nPros\n\n+beautiful aesthetic\n+wonderfully crafted and memorable world\n+great dialogue and voice acting\n+great soundtrack\n+turt reynolds\n\nCons\n\n- quite short\n- mystery plot feels a bit convoluted\n\nFirewatch is a game that truly shows what indie devs are capable of putting out these days, with it's phenomenal art design and great soundtrack it makes you wonder where the budget is going in some of the bigger triple A titles. Firewatch impresses you the moment you boot into the game and hit the menu screen. You are presented with a beautiful backdrop of crystal blue skies and a watchtower overlooking the forests below on the mountain it resides atop of.\n\nOnce you're in game, the soundtrack kicks in as you navigate through a Choose Your Own Adventure styled story of how you met your future wife, Julia, at a bar while you were a bit too drunk. You make multiple decisions about your life with Julia and these decisions feel major, as if they could change the course of your game. This definitely feels influenced by the lead writer Sean Vanaman who is well known for his work on Telltale The Walking Dead Season 1, which has a similar CYOA feel to it. While you make these choices, you see glimpses of Henry getting into his pickup truck, with a huge backpack in tow and slowly hiking through a forest with what seems like no end in sight and no real destination.\n\nEscapism is a constant theme in Firewatch, every character is in one way or another running away from their problems, too afraid to face them head on. Henry finally makes his way to his destination, a lonely watchtower in the middle of nowhere. You head up the stairs, turn on the power and grab your radio to introduce yourself to your fateful companion for the rest of the game. Her name is Delilah and she immediately asks "What's wrong with you?", certain that people only take this job to get away from something with Delilah being no exception. Everyone in this game in one form or another is running away from their problems, escaping into the vast wilderness in hopes of finding answers, or at least some sort of distraction from their thoughts. The characters feel human and vulnerable, allowing you to empathize with them in a deeper way you can't normally do with action man saves the world from inevitable destruction tropes. Firewatch is firmly rooted and grounded in reality like the nature you observe around you, giving you ample opportunity to find the answers you so desperately seek. Sometimes in life though, the answers you get aren't always the ones you hoped to find and the closure you desired just won't be given through another person but through your own willingness to just accept that life doesn't play fair.\n\nDelilah is your emotional lifeline throughout the game, being the only source of contact with the outside world that you have. You play as a fire lookout, a summer job that Henry takes by choice to feel isolated and alone for the summer months to work through his emotions. Being a lookout comes with the monotonous repetition of just sitting around and doing nothing for most of the day granting Henry the freedom to use his antique typewriter that his stepsister bought him. His monotonous routine is soon broken when he comes across a strange shadowy figure after exiting a cave heading back to homebase and he finds his typewriter was thrown out the watchtower's window along with his entire room being ransacked. Henry is convinced this is no mere coincidence, as the very next day power lines are cut meaning you can no longer contact the outside world if anything were to go wrong. Reminiscent of Alan Wake, something just feels off with the people you find in the Wyoming wilderness. While you do meet a few people along the way you never directly see them in person, they're always silhouettes or shadows far off in the distance, never quite feeling real. You get this eerie feeling that you might be being watched by an outside presence, but you quickly brush it away as paranoia.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it's the banter between Henry and Delilah where Firewatch feels most comfortable. As you see them sarcastically poking fun each other or just conversing about their surroundings it just feels natural. The dialogue is always entertaining and witty with Delilah's sharp tongue constantly harping on Henry's naivety and inexperience, and it's up to the player for Henry to take it in stride playfully or take offense to it. It's your decision on how you want your relationship with Delilah to be if you allow it to, the boundaries between boss and worker completely disappear as time goes on. Or you can rarely respond or just outright shut her down at every chance never giving Delilah a chance at friendship.\n\nIt's the world that Firewatch has meticulously crafted that makes it feel so special. Wyoming has never looked so beautiful, with it's lush green forest mixed with beautiful warm red tones from the basking sunlight. The world around you feels lived in, at peace with itself, never worrying about your presence. It welcomes you with open arms, regardless of your intentions and accepts you as one of it's own. It is also a reminder that even after you are gone, the world will continue to live on, the trees will keep on swaying and the sun will keep on setting.\n\nThe soundtrack is sparse, leaving long spaces of silence. Complete absent at times, leaving time for you to be completely immersed in your surroundings. The ambiance of the surrounding nature being your soundtrack, hearing the trees swaying with the wind, the birds chirping in the early morning and the sounds of your footsteps crushing the grass beneath you. It's during the most story driven moments that the soundtrack kicks in, and when it does it is a very welcome addition with its low key synths and guitar. Never does the soundtrack feel out of place, perfectly supplementing your characters emotions and the tension of the moment.\n\nExploration is a major component of the gameplay with ongoing dialogue with Delilah in between the treks to new places. To make a direct comparison it feels like a hybrid of a Telltale game, where most of the dialogue is chosen by the player and giving you the freedom to mold Henry in your own image but instead of movement through point and clicking, you directly control Henry and use him to interact with items in first person. There are no real puzzles to solve other than the plot itself and if you have a horrible sense of direction like me, you will get lost more than a couple times along the many forested paths. Thankfully it's just as easy to get back on track with your trusty map and compass on hand with just a click of a button at anytime.\n\nThe animations feel crisp and fluid with Henry directly interacting with climbing ledges, knocking down trees, rappelling down hills. You can pretty much interact with any kind of item by picking it up and inspecting it or throwing it around. The items usually give you a bit of insight of the person that left it behind, you'll find books, trinkets, even antlers that people may have forgotten on the path. These small things give the world a human touch, giving you a sense of how these people lived and interacted with the world itself. These personal touches are scattered everywhere for you to explore and find to witness that you are not first on the path, and you will not be it's last.\n\nFirewatch is an enjoyable and emotional experience and one that you will be glad to have been an active participant in Henry's journey.","February 9","true","13.2"," 175 of 295 people (59%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","59","175","295","12","6"

It's an incredibly well-done game - albiet small - but it relies more on character and story than anything else.\n\nThe one complaint I've heard others voice is that there are plot holes and the ending is a disappointment, but I don't quite see it that way. There were unanswered questions, and a few points that straight-up should have been explained FAR better than they were (which was not at all), but many of the "holes" people talk about are really "fill in the blanks." For example, Delilah's character never reveals a particularly rich history, but it's about what she doesn't say, and what the player interprets that that makes Delilah especially interesting: she can be a very different character for each player.\n\nI personally liked that the plot of the game was open-ended in a lot of aspects, because when in life is everything really wrapped up so neatly?\n\nIf you're looking for something with twists and turns that ends with everything wrapped up - this is NOT the game for you.\n\nIf you're looking for a great experience with character depth, fantastic voice acting. a mystery, and a beautiful little world to explore, then this game is absolutely for you.","February 16","true","6.2"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","28","37","0","3"

I milked around 5 hours out of it, and that was really stretching to find any way around the linear pathing you are funneled through as the story progresses. I won't rehash in detail what others have already said, but it is basically a walking simulator, with a small amount of story, inconsequential "choices", and not much else.\n\nYou can pick a small number of items up, but rarely can use or interact with them in any meaningful way. You can chose to save some items for later, which will end up on your desk to.... save for later again? Most items you can interact with have no consequece or importance. The story at the end seems rushed and thrown together last minute just to wrap things up. Choices have no real consequences and if they change the story at all it is only in minor superficial ways.\n\nIt is priced too high for what you get. The game is on rails, and if played at a reasonable pace without trying to explore (which is pointless anyway) it takes about 3-4 hours start to finish with a rushed ending. Should be $9.99usd tops.\n\nI had been looking forward to this game for a while, but it's a pretty big disappointment. It had a lot of potential if a number of things were done differently. Choices should have more of an impact. The items found in game should have more purpose, and give you a reason to collect them and explore.

Why the negative review? Because, when you press "write the review" is says "Do you recommend this game?". I do not, it is not a game.\nI have no clue why there are multiple save slots as I have no intention to go through walking for 4 hours in the forest exprerince. You cannot review this without spoilers, I will just say that there is a relationship building aspect and some mystery element. Perhaps, just PERHAPS, there might be a "proper" way to go through dialogs and get a different ending, but why would I care?

Being an indie game it was outstanding, I was truly amazed of how well put the dialogue was and the many choices.\n\nCON-For a indie game the slapped on price tag of 20 bucks is huge, mostly with a game giving you roughly 5-6 hours of content depending on how often you play. The Ending will be very disappointing.\n\nBUY?-Buy the game to watch the graphic thrive and the many relations you will make. Beware of the story details.\n\nSPOILER ALERT-The Story is the games backbone, at first you start out as a ranger, the story drove to a great start. With Henry's many interaction with Deliah ;), but the game lacks in a proper ending, EVEN a resolution to a semi-conflict. As Henry you assume someone is stalking you and Deliah, which is right, but why do it in the first place. Ned (a guy whose son died in a "rope climbing incident" and a former ranger) was stalking both of Deliah and Henry's conversation. Henry follows Ned's track and leads him to his dead son. But Why show Ned's dead son than suddenly disappear without a trace. Yes you find where Ned was hiding previously but why show it if there is no resolution and even a hint on how to erase what Ned did. Its like suddenly everything Ned was threatening to do fell into place and solved itself!? First were the girls which went missing and later found somewhere irrelevant and all of the mixed meaning recordings. Such as Deliah imposing on burning a camp down, which was later burnt down by Ned. All those threats were suddenly resolved by a fate or never explained (the recordings). The game's ending was pathetic, Henry has a very unrelative talk with Deliah at the end forcing you to disconnect from Deliah (as she suddenly doesn't anything to do with you) and leave the park in a helicopter. If that is the ending and presntation of a solution than why even mix that with a game with a good setting and great idea. The ending kills the overall of the game. The game felt very rushed at the end, if they tried a little bit harder and organized what Ned did and the effects (Moral of the story), than the game would easily be one of the greatest story rich game following by idols such as Life Is Strange.","March 15","false","5.2"," 93 of 152 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","93","152","3","5"

There are no puzzles or challenges of any kind, it merely consists of going from point A to point B using a map and or compass to then begin interacting with something at said points to continue the story.\n\nAs I said, the game has it's positive factors too, the scenery is beautiful along with the art-style, the voice acting is professional and believable and the story-line is amazingly compelling, all really great factors for a game that relies heavily on it's narrative. You keep wanting to progress forward just see what happens next and what else you will find, and while quite a short game, the story was enjoyable and intriguing.\n\nIn my honest opinion, a strong and compelling story is a huge plus for any game, but when said games lack any real game-play and are relatively short in length, they should not have as high a price tag as Firewatch does, regardless of how well crafted they are. If the game were around the £7.99 / £9.99 mark as opposed to the standard £14.99, I'd be more inclined to recommend trying it out, but alas, I just don't feel it's worth the asking price, The Stanley Parable suffers from the exact same problem too.\n\nI did enjoy my time with Firewatch, I'm glad I left my comfort zone and tried something new, but I just can't recommend it for it's default price. Don't get me wrong, it was a great experience, I would just advise waiting for a heavy sale (30-50% off perhaps) before you decide to buy it.","February 10","false","8.7"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","30","41","0","0"

It simply is not worth what they are charging for it, as there is a total of about 3 to 4 hours of gameplay. There is no reason to repeat, as the only difference is the occasional different dialogue options. The reason I say that it is unfortunate that I cannot recomend it, is that the beggining and middle of the game were amazing, and I had lots of fun, and enjoyed the story they were laying out for me. A part of me even liked the end, and how different it was from what I expected, but the end came far too soon. The story felt like there was a whole saga planned, as though it would keep going, but instead you skip days. The game even shows you skip days, going from 2, to 9, then to 64, ect. The map was fun to explore, but there just was not enough of it TO explore. If you intend to have an exploration based game, you have to have a map of similar size to TLD, or Arma 2 or 3. When I started the game, and as it pulled me in, I began to expect a story on par with Alan Wake (1, not the abomination that was 2). I expected the game to revolve around the story, as it was simply a platform for the story to be told on, and in the begging it did, but then the story got rushed, pushed along to fast at the end. The build up was good, but then it suddenly ended and you were on the downhill, then it was over.\n\nI loved the game, and had lots of fun playing it, but there simply wasn't enough, of anything. There wasn't enough map to explore, there wasn't enough story, there weren't enough different options.","February 11","false","4.5"," 47 of 71 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","47","71","0","0"

I really did like some snippets of this game, but it wasn't enough to win me over. When I got further into the game and eventually beat it, I felt pretty empty and betrayed. Firewatch builds up a pretty interesting story and characters just to ruin it at the end and throughout.\n\n\nWhat I liked:\n-The voice acting was very convincing and felt very genuine. Very charming game.\n-This game made me feel  emotions, joy, sadness, suspense, something I crave from games but rarely get.\n-The visuals are gorgeous, quite possibly one of the most beautiful games I've played. (I've spent alot of time taking screenshots)\n-The soundtrack was beautiful and played at very appropriate moments. Guided the  players' emotions.\n\nWhat I did not like:\n-The game was very linear and more often than not did not feel more open, rather it had the illusion of being open.\n-The story fell flat on its face toward the end and halted to a stop abruptly. A giant build up just for nothing (very disappointed personally)\n-Player choices did not matter at all. the game doesn't take any turns if you choose a certain line of dialogue. (at least thats what I gathered, I may be wrong)\n-Very short, I usually enjoy short games, for example Dishonored. With this game, it was too short for its own good and could have been longer so the story met a satisfactory ending.\n-Price tag is a little too high for this game, I felt like I paid too much for what I got.\n-Boring achievements. Congrats you did something mandatory to finishing the game!\n\nSome of my additional opinions:\n-The main  characters, Henry and Delilah, should have tried to fix each others issues rather than continue to just point them out, some character progression would be nice.\n-Their chemistry got a bit stale for me, but never got annoying.\n\nConclusion:\nI don't want to tell you if you should get it or not because I don't feel like I have the authority to do so. Take my points into consideration and come to your own conclusion. Because I can't give a neutral review on steam I will give it a negative review since I'm teetering more on not recommending it. I don't hate it since it did give me some enjoyment even if it was followed by disappointing. I really wish there was a better ending to Firewatch. Maybe wait until a sale.\n\nThanks for your time!","February 10","false","3.6"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","35","50","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ABudiJ/recommended/383870/","ABudiJ","Budi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ABudiJ/","301 products in account","Firewatch is a first person exploration game. There's not much interaction with the world besides picking up and examining some items. You play as Henry, a volunteer fire lookout at the wilderness of Wyoming. You keep contact through a radio with your supervisor Delilah. And this atleast for me was the best part of the game, the well written dialogue between characters where you can make choices how to react and what to say. These choices won't affect the actual plot of the game, but ofcourse will shape the relationship between Delilah and Henry. The voice acting is magnificent. The actors make everything sound so natural and real. I wish there were even more dialogue choices to make, too often there were no options at all.\n\nThe world looks beautiful and is quite fun to explore with a map and a compass at hand. Unfortunately the world has very little if any wildlife. I suppose it's ment to highlight the feeling of isolation, but it would have made the world less static and bit more interesting. The music in the game is used very sparingly, but always adds to the already great atmosphere.\n\nBecause of the short nature of the game, around 4-6 hours I won't talk about the story and plot points. It's all better left for the player to discover. There are big tonal shifts throughout the game, it starts with brilliant heavily dramatic text based intro and goes to jolly first day at the job. There's bit of a romance and suspense. There has been complaints about red herrings and dissapointing ending. But in my opinion, the game did really good job of putting me in Henry's shoes. I felt paranoia, joy, remorse and also dissapointment with him. It wasn't dissapointment about the game. The story, just like the characters felt real and mature. There's also have been people pointing out plot holes, but that's mainly because they weren't paying attention or were excepting something different. Though there is one thing I personally can't explain but nothing too major.\n\nFirewatch is a good start for Campo Santo as their first game. I know they can do even better so I will be getting their next game day one also. Ofcourse this game is nott for everyone, since it could be called as glorified walking simulator. But personally, im open for more narrative driven even quite short experiences when the price matches that.\n\n[Score: 84]","March 7","true","6.0"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

Immersive visuals and seemingly open ended plot draw you in right off the bat. The game makes it clear that your interactions with Delilah are integral to the experience and they do a great job with the execution of the dialog. In fact, they did such a great job that I think this model could shape some future games.\nThe early game seems pregnant with possibilities, but it doesn't take long to detect the smoke and mirrors. Soon you realize that actual map isn't NEARLY as open-ended as it seems and all those fancy dialouge options funnel you down the same plot. The plot, by the way, wasn't that horrible. I liked it because it was realistic. BUT why not have had an array of potential endings that depend on the dialogue and gameplay decisions made by the character? THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS BUYING. And that's the fatal flaw in my optinion... I didn't need this game to be sandbox but I didn't expect it to be a glorified interactive movie.

Depending on that, the dialogues might differ and/or you'll hear something which you wouldn't if you had chosen another answer.\nThough this won't change the outcome of the game, the story is very linear, but you'll also have time to walk around and explore every corner of the woods if you like.\n\nGameplay-wise there is not much to do, there are some objects throughout the game you can inspect, some others you can take with you (and very few of them are actually necessary to advance the plot - but those are not missable).\nEven exploring is not always that interesting, of course, sometimes you stumble upon something you can talk to Delilah about, but there are few things to interact with/talk about with her.\n\nThough i liked the beauty of nature and the atmosphere quite a lot.\nWhich brings me to the graphics: They are pretty colorful, beautiful and comic-like and the created atmosphere is sometimes breathtaking.\nThe paths through the forest and canyons are rather linear, with different trails to walk or climb, mixed with some more open areas where you can stroll around.\n\nOverall it doesn't take that much time, to finish the game. If you go through the game with rather little exploration and run from time to time, i'd say you'll need around 4 hours to finish.\n\nI'd recommend this to you, if you like games which have a focus on characters, atmosphere and story, rather than gameplay mechanics.","February 11","true","5.2"," 85 of 143 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","85","143","4","2"

But, after playing the 3.2 Hours i did in one night, not rushing at all, I won't ever touch the game again. Don't get me wrong, i absolutely adored the art style and interesting setting. That along with the character Delila's communication between the player, Henry, are the only good points in this demo-lenght game. The game is technically open world, in the sense that you can, at any point in the story, traverse the unblocked paths. However, it is just that, only paths, no real exploration is ever presented to the player aside from clicking on different objects in a tent. The story is very entertaining and has a good draw to it from the start, but it begins to falter into the later third of the 3 hour game. Overall, the game is definitely not worth the $20 asked for it. You could just as well go on the Firewatch website and order a print for around the same price, and that would have more value to you in the end than this game, which might as well be an expensive point-and-click title, ever will.","February 9","false","3.2"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","27","39","2","0"

As if it went overbudget and they just wanted to ship it by wrapping it up ASAP. The story, art direction (albeit lazy) and voice talent is nice, but the rest of it just falls flat:\n\nEarly on you come across a camera which you can use to take photographs of evidence -- which is deliberately hinted as something you should be doing -- but it doesn't actually amount to anything. I forgot I even had it later in the game, but it turns out it doesn't matter anyway because whatever you do with it is never referenced again.\nIllusion of choice is a recurring theme. At one point you get to choose between starting a fire and not starting a fire. If you don't, it'll coincidentally start anyway because reasons. It's the worst example, but it is moreorless a metaphor for the entire game.\nThere are a few visual bugs, such as floating grass, one-sided rocks and in some cases prematurely unloaded areas that ruin the immersion a bit.\nA minor subplot is suddenly the main focus at the last minute of the game. The kid being found dead in the cave was the least interesting plot and didn't hook me as much as the main mystery.\nAre you seriously implying that Delilah wasn't going to wait five freaking minutes to meet Henry face-to-face after nearly three months of bonding just to get on a helicopter a little earlier, even though that she knew that the helicopters were going to come back and she even said they were "making the rounds"?\nThe ending is really abrupt. It just... ends.\nIf you want to play a good mystery game where you play as a man who loves typewriters, I guess there's Alan Wake.","February 10","false","3.0"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","2"

I can't comment on the story without spoiling so I'll just say there are things I liked and things I didn't.\n\nThe reason im saying no is that this game cost me approximatley 17 usd.  My personal template is 1 dollar for 1 hour of entertainment however Im willing to pay more if I think the game is really special.  I beat the game in something like 5 hours (sorry I didn't check how long I played)...and 1 hour of that was literally trying to find the correct path or area I was told to go to.  At one point I walked to an area seeing a very obvious object that seemed out of place but nothing happened.  The event later triggered as I walked deeper into the area after wandering around for 15 minutes.  I liked the rappelling part too but at some point it just kind of became annoying.  You spend probably another 20 mins rappelling.  So there is really only about 3 to 4 hours of game play for a 17 dollar game.\n\nThe interactions between Deliah and Henry are great...and the voice actors were superb.  I just can't see this game being worth more than 5 bucks right now and I hate to say that because I know these guys worked hard and I want to encourage devs who break away from cookie cutter designs but id really hold off on this one until there is a sale of at least 50%.","February 9","false","4.3"," 38 of 59 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","38","59","0","0"

It's a no from me. I love story driven games. Hell, I've even defended games like "Gone Home" and TellTale's "The Walking Dead" from people who state they're not good because they lack gameplay.. And to be fair, I usually don't mind a casual-type game where there's really not much going on. It's hard to recommend Firewatch because it fails to really deliver a cohesive story with a satisfying ending. The characters are okay, but not as interesting as I'd hope they'd be. I actually enjoyed the first 10-15 minutes before the actual "game" started more than the rest of it, and it was just a text-based adventure.\n\nThe Good:\n+ The ambience is top notch\n+ Characters are alright and dialogue runs well\n+ The soundtrack is beautiful\n+ Beautiful scenery with a nice artistic design\n\nThe Bad:\n- Somewhat convoluted plot\n- The "conclusion" and last 15 minutes really tear apart the story they built\n- Constant framerate issues\n- Bugs (would become stuck in a bush, have to reload, get stuck in a rock, etc.\n- Very linear\n- Lots of backtracking\n- Could be considered a "walking simulator"\n- Short (beat it within 4 hours)\n\nAs I said above, I would love to recommend this game to everyone. I'm not someone that can't stand a game because all I do in it is walk around a dark, abandoned house or a beautiful, lush forest- but instead someone that finds it hard enjoy a game that lacks anything that makes it interesting. Firewatch is the latter. As much as I enjoyed a bit of the story, it's not enough to make me recommend people to spend their money on. If it ever goes on sale for a few bucks, it might be a decent buy to waste a few hours on.","February 10","false","4.0"," 31 of 47 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","31","47","0","0"

And then.. the choices got harder and harder.  And by the time that i was actually able to walk around i was fully invested in Henry's story.  I will admit, the scenery was quite lovely and the dialogue between Henry and Delilah was entertaining.  However, i dont think it was worth its price. If you do decide to get this game, wait until it is on sale.  I felt there was not enough content for it to be worth its full listing price.. or even its sale price (which was 17.00 when i got it.)\n\nSad to say, i ended up not enjoying much of the scenery because i was glued to the map the entire time, making sure i was going the right direction.  There was all this suspense towards the end.. and i was floored the entire game long, waiting for something amazing to happen something to be revealed.. some deadly secret everyone was keeping from me.  But at the end of the game.. six hours in.. the ending left me feeling dissapointed.  I needed more answers.. the abrupt way it ended just felt.. wrong.. the whole time i expected more.. but there was nothing.  Honestly, the game end made me feel like someone ripped the middle and parts of the end out of a really good book and then just left me with the scraps.\n\nNot to mention i spent nearly an hour stuck on a set of rocks, glitching out with invisible walls which didn't seem like they should be there at all.  Why let me climb a rock and then not go back down the other side when its touching the ground.  It was rather frustrating.\n\nIn the end.. this game is a walking simulator.. which i tend to enjoy when they have a story.. but this one.. felt dull and lifeless.  I mean.. it wasn't really bad because i was glued to the screen the entire time i was playing.. but the ending.. just felt like a huge cop out.  So.. in the end.. i would say only play this game if you are looking for nothing exciting to happen.","February 9","false","6.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

For a 4 hour game (a fact that I'm okay with) you spend too much time on things that take too much time from the main storyline or they are so loosely tied to the storyline that they seem to be random events. In fact, for most of the game I was wondering what the main storyline was and what the message was. Is the character supposed to be finding something out about themselves? Do they go through some adversity or gain some kind of insight to better understand their problems? All of those questions are hard to answer given the entire journey. At the end of the game, I'm still confused as to what the point of the game was. The first hour really allows you to empathize with the characters situation, but everything after that is so rushed or brief that you barely have time to process it.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more disappointed I was that this game got so close to being a GOTY game to a mere afterthought.","February 11","false","4.7"," 39 of 62 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","39","62","0","0"

I noticed immediately that there were people who didn't think it lived up to what was presented. So I took the chance. And I will say, I was completely satisfied.\n\nThe moment you enter the game, you feel like you are there. Emotions are set, the environment just consumes you.\nAnd for future warning to anyone reading this, you will not stop playing. It's one of those games that draws you in to the point of, "I have to know what's going to happen next." "Where does this path lead, and what will trigger the next event?"\n\nI found myself getting lost, occasionally pulling out my map and blatantly wandering through streams and brush. The map itself is not huge, but it's absolutely nothing to complain about. I didn't expect it to be Skyrim, I just wanted to feel like I was there in the woods and keep the need for exploration. And that's what happened. The game is ridiculously gorgeous. From the sun rising and setting, the streams of light through the trees, to the streams and rock formations.\n\nThe story itself drives you to finish. I really had no desire to stop playing. And though some were not content with the ending, I loved the way it ended. My girlfriend sat next to me the whole time. When she left the room, she'd rush back and ask me what she missed. It's rare to find a game that will pull you in like that.\n\nSo go get lost, scaling down a rock face. Scan your flashlight along a vast chasm wall. Go take a picture of a raccoon on a stump.

I'd advise against buying the game unless it's $5 or less...and I feel like I'm being generous.\n\n\n\n\nLong Review (Some spoliers)\n\nFirewatch is everything an indie game should strive NOT to be.  It’s short, has no replayability, no game mechanics and a bad story.\n\nIt's a slice of life tale that is fed to you from the start as a man whose wife develops Alzheimer's in her 30's and is ultimately taken by her family to live in Australia.  The protagonist is Henry a tortured man that takes a job as a lookout for the summer to watch for fires alone in the wilderness.  This is explained all by unvoiced text at the start of the game.\n\nThus begins the story in where you are greeted by Delilah(head lookout) over the radio who will be the only other character this in game.  The game is really linear so you are pushed on to immediately tracking down people setting off fireworks.   Overall a decent start, you get down there and you fine 2 drunk college girls skinny dipping in the lake.  You return home and catch a glimpse of mysterious man making the player curious.\n\nAt this point the game does a fine job of building tension and suspense.  The main problem the story some scenes exist purely for setting a tone of suspense or danger.  The player doesn’t realize this at first and is only made aware of it at the very end.\n\nFor example, a lot more happens with those girls(supposedly) and they vanish from the story after they are reported missing.  No follow up or anything, all of tension and suspense around them vanishes and they become so unimportant the devs didn’t even mention their fate, yet are made out to be potential players in the mystery.\n\nThe worse crime the devs committed was the ending, it totally ruins the story in so many ways.  To the point it poisoned the whole game for me.   After playing the game, I wish I had never played it….it was that bad.  It cheapens the whole experience which was the length of a long movie.  The game should have been way cheaper and the reviews are deceiving.  I’d be happy to go over my thoughts in detail on the game/steam forums but they appear to ban topics of criticism of this very flawed game.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are good things about the game such as the dialogue and voice acting but that isn't enough.  That doesn't make the game.\n\nTL;DR?\nFirewatch is the MOST overrated game I’ve ever seen based on the reviews and has one of the worst stories of any game I’ve ever played.\n\nEdit: Some spacing and grammar.","May 13","false","3.4"," 60 of 101 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","60","101","0","3"

So, I decided to purchase it for myself, and here's what I found. The dialogue was almost straight out of a movie. Though I was satisfied with the final product, I still feel 'cheated.'\n\nPros:\n-Excellent graphics\n-You could hear emotions through each of the voices\n-Song choices were very well fit in certain situations\n-The story is engaging (up until the final mission.)\n\nCons:\n-It's a game based in the wilderness.. and I saw one Deer.\n-Lot's of the time you can't create conversation with "D". At that point, it becomes a walking simulator\n-ZERO physical threats throughout the entire game.\n-The ending is absolutely horrible. When I saw the credits roll, I wanted my ~4 hours back.\n-No replay value\n-Too expensive for what you get\n-Pretty straight-forward paths (With not too much freedom)\n\nI would love to see a DLC out for this game. I wouldn't go into to much detail to spoil the game, but that final mission was the absolute worst. You have to run across the map to a certain point, and along the way you run into NO problems. Not a fire in the way, not an animal trying to eat you, not a group of bandits trying to harm you. The ending dialogue between the two characters was terrible aswell.\n\nI only recommend this if you have the time to waste.

There are dialogue choices, but you have little to no impact on the story or anything in the game, really. The story revolves around you unraveling the mystery of someone stalking you and Deliah, the only other person you hear talking in the game. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.\n\nThis game is like a walking simulator with an "interesting" narrative. I say interesting, but it's really just about you finding out about how the son of a previous lookout fell and died in a climbing accident. The guy, named Ned Goodwin, becomes a hermit that tries to prevent you from finding out that his son died. This is the reason for the paranoia mystery that the game tries to make you follow through.\n\nSo throughout the game, you'll walk around a somewhat "open world" forest that looks pretty nice. You'll use a map to find your way around, but it's really not that complicated to do. You'll walk around back and forth a bit, update your map, find new rope, and you'll soon find yourself being skipped from Day 3 to Day 70 in an instant.\n\nThis game is not worth 20 dollars. Not even worth 3 dollars, in my opinion. It feels more like a free indie game than anything else; except it just looks nicer. I honestly feel like 20 dollars was a huge scam. I expected a really mystery or psychological game. Or maybe something cool in preventing forest fires, I don't know. My second time preordering games, and I am now ashamed of myself for not learning the lesson the first time. I preordered Fallout 4 and was disappointed with it for many good reasons.\n\nIn conclusion, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. 2/10 for the nice view and story.","February 10","false","3.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","3"

[Even though that tag is mysteriously missing from the store page]\n\nIts a Walking Simulator goobai.\n\nAlright fine. Let us parse the branches in this experience.\n\nYou play as a forest ranger in the state of Wyoming. Your job is simple. Look for fires and report them and also don't die.\n\nThe game begins with a series of text bubbles that set up the background of Henry, who you play as; Now, everyone is going to have a slightly different experience at this junction. As far as I understand this is also the case for the rest of the game. Each person will have a unique impression and take away from each time dialogue choices are made. But I have played 1 and 1/3 times through this game at the time of writing this and the through line is quite linear but the subtlety comes from each dialogue choice. I should also mention at this point the games primary interaction is with speaking with one specific character through a radio. Presumably located in another tower.\n\nNow, I will not say ANYTHING specific as the games bread and butter is exploration and well... figuring out what this game is exactly. I will say that this is one of those games where I could literally just sit at the edge of precipice and just relax, listen to the wind blow and be extant. At some point you additionally start to know the park without needing to take heed of the compass and map and that's when you start to take some ownership in what you are doing.\n\nThere are a lot things that are alluded to throughout the narrative that never really come to fruition or a satisfying culmination but that doesn't really take away from what does happen. I believe the writing is intentionally misleading. You need not look far for red herrings.\n\nTHE GIST\nI REALLY like this game but like most walking simulators they need to played without any sort of spoilers and that makes it very difficult to write about. It has very adult, mature themes. Again I don't want to say anything. I will not be responsible should anything get spoiled for you. But this game is very potentially depressing. It has very prescient issues in today’s world despite taking place in the late 80's as a lot of humans have relationships with other humans who do not actually have much physical proximity. It deals with ideas of isolation and paranoia, the real kind. Not some supernatural put on hokey pokey crap. I do think it ends rather abruptly however, there is definitely more I want to know.

Above all, though, it's about the feeling you get when the summer comes to an end and it's time to go home. Do you feel disillusioned? Did the bonds you form mean anything? That's for you to find out.\n\nFirewatch is a narrative experience that lasts roughly five hours, and it's not something I'd particularly want to play again. However, I loved this game and my experience with it will be something I'll talk about and think about in the future when I think about how games can do things that books and movies cannot. I highly recommend it.","March 7","true","4.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Very good combination of excellent level/art design, dialogue, and mood.\n\nThe mostly text intro is clunky and boring. But it does ask you to make some decisions that get you to think about your values and give the main character and interesting backstory.\n\nIt feels like something that could actually happen, which is so rare in video games. Spoiler alert: there is nothing supernatural, magic, sci-fi, or violent happening in this game.\n\nThis game deals with regular ♥♥♥♥ing human problems. Sickness, aging, death, love, lonliness. Fear. Curiosity. Survival. Responsibility. There's no killing, there's no points, there's not even really jumping.\n\nYet despite the lack of action or bright, flashing colors, it manages to provide a captivating experience. The forest feels alive and like a character all to its own. Navigating it doesn't feel like a chore. The game knows exactly when to skip you to the next location and when do let you walk it yourself.\n\nAll in all an enjoyable experiment and I'm looking forward to more from this developer.\n\n","February 11","true","4.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alienhell/recommended/383870/","Alienhell","Alienhell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alienhell/","517 products in account","The thing that infuriates me about Firewatch is that it has so much going for it, but fumbles with its content that barely fills three hours to a predictable end.\n\nOpening with a text-based sequence that knocks the emotional appeal of the game out of the park, coupled with a simple tutorial sequence that furthers the story and shows off the game's aesthetics: I was impressed when I started playing Firewatch last night.\nRounding off that intro and getting through the first day of protagonist Henry's new job, I was stunned by the immensely appealing aesthetic qualities of the game, which you can clearly see in the screenshots for the game. As I continued on, getting stuck into an intriguing mystery and some great voice acting, I found myself only being drawn further into a story that seemed to slowly expand over time and could seemingly spring in any direction unexpectedly. The paranoia and honest moments of fear that emerged were great, really amping up the beauty of the canyons and forests into a fearful wilderness.\nBut as each day of the game passed, the story narrowed itself down in a way I had already spectulated for myself and I increasingly saw through each day of the game as less of a continuation of the story but more of a level of playing the game - very simply moving from place to place without feeling anything more of that space. The story became more so a string in the forests to be picked up and followed, trivialising the agency of my character and discouraging a more organic and free exploration of the space.\n\nThe colour palette and visual appeal of Firewatch is genuinely extraordinary. I don't think I've seen anything quite like this before in a game, wherein I look at my surroundings and this environment and really feel that I'm there: one man in all this nature. The singular lighting, the intense colour through the trees, the distant horizons and lush fauna: Firewatch is a beautiful game. Even if the appeal wears off over time, the beauty and finesse with which the environments have been composed is great and should be commended as one of the best features of Firewatch alongside its voice acting and soundtrack.\n\nThe story of Firewatch is very much so the Hitchcock-ian thriller, deconstructed in part. The lingering notes of people missing, things left in precarious places and "that can't be right" moments that fall down to you give a great sense of mystery to the story and fit the bill quite well. The issue is that they only expand so far, in the end ultimately being given up for sake of a rather predictable pursuit of characters that we don't feel connected to. Likewise, Firewatch lets go of its emotional bedrock that starts the game off very quickly and only ever returns to it briefly in order to reassure some kind of feeling that I certainly didn't have halfway through the game.\nA disappointing aspect is that whatever you find will ultimately be relevant to the central story in a way that diminishes the overall effect of the game. For example: there is one cave in the game. Just the one. And something is in the cave because you found that one cave. Nothing gets left lingering or tying itself up. Everything falls down to this ending that really isn't that appealing: the conversation from which it comes up in originally just rolls off like every other conversation you have in the game. It's disappointing to know that the game world, although feeling big, is actually just as small as any other nowadays. It diminishes its appeal massively and in the end throws the majority of it away.\n\nThe voice acting is grand, despite treading the convoluted story over time. Given more time, I'm sure the true emotional range of these characters would blossom in a way that fees more developed and mature for the story's themes. But instead, Delilah tells you of cripplingly stupid decisions she's made that make zero sense in such a small timeframe. The to and fro that her and Henry engage in is wonderful but unfortunately often lacks the depth that I feel it aspires to with its emotional backstory.\n\nI wish Firewatch was longer. After three hours, I didn't feel like I had gotten £15/£19's worth of an experience. In parts it felt rushed and painfully so, sacrificing its mystery and isolated veneer for story progression and clumsy, forceful character development. Firewatch is a beautiful game, but an empty one also, in the end falling down on its seemingly meaningless story (what the hell did it happen for?), which cannot be redeemed despite its aesthetic strengths.\n\nGot off to a great start and then became a brief trickle down to an uninvolving end.","February 10","false","3.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nixx0r/recommended/383870/","nixx0r","nixx0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nixx0r/","81 products in account","I echo the sentiment of others. At the end of the day, this game has only 3 hours of content with little to no replayability. Buy it when it's on sale for $5-10. At that price, it's a game interactive story worth playing being part of. At $20, it's alright at best.\n\nPrice tags shouldn't really influence how good a game is, but in this case it does. For example, a AAA title with only 20-30 hours of gameplay (the low end) at $60 is still worth it if the hours are fun (Shadows of Mordor is a good example). In this case, however, I can't seem to justify paying a third of a triple-A title with only one tenth of the gameplay, if that. Something just doesn't feel right.\n\nAnyway, price rant over, here's the actual review, with a warning that some of this may be considered minor spoilers given the nature of a "mystery" game:\n\nWithout getting too involved in the plot, the story starts off with an almost text-based choose your own adventure style RPG about the romance, life, and love lost, leading up to your taking a job as fire watchman. You end up wedding a "Julia", and life is good, but some things aren't so good. Eventually, things are pretty bad, and you run off to do manly stuff in the forest. I'm exaggerating points here, but basically no matter how you try to "choose your own adventure", you still end up having to deal with this depressing plot premise. None of the text based intro ends up being relevant to the game except to set the stage for some of the quirky dialog later on. And to tell you what your motivation is. Really? You needed to give me a whole cliché backstory just to justify why I would want to move to Wyoming to be an awesome fire watching person? Oh well, at least we made it to the watch tower! Now we can do fun watch tower stuff with this mysterious radio voice girl!\n\nThe game is very linear and story based. It's basically a 3 hour interactive movie. That's not a bad thing, it's actually kind of refreshing, because it's NOT told through ridiculously frustrating cutscenes. Instead, the game is the cutscene, if you will. That said, the story itself is fairly anti-climactic, as others have pointed out. You might have guessed it from the vague trailers and concept, but you're in the wilderness doing one of the most mundane jobs ever. Your expectations should be set around this fact. This is one of those "take joy in the little things" indie type stories that you would see premiered at Sundance. It's Wild, in game form.\n\nAs for the artwork, it is nothing short of glorious. The game looks great and that is what sells the game. It's why you will probably buy this game anyway, even after reading this review. And guess what? You can take pictures! And order real life prints of the pictures you took in game! Yay!?\n\nAs you may have guessed in the lead up, the thing that bugged me the most about this game is the dialog and character choices. I simply had a hard time empathizing or identifying with any of the characters, and I found the "witty" banter between you and Delilah (your firewatch boss) to be awkward and forced. There were some relatively heartwarming moments, but for the most part, it felt like they were ad libbing half of the conversations, and poorly. The interactions with Delilah did little to advance the plot or relationships in the game except for 2-3 key moments. Everything else I probably could have done without. I get that they were trying to create a Portal-like relationship with this "ominous voice", but I felt like the execution was off. Especially since (major spoiler) she was about a 10 minute hike away but you two never ever meet over the course of 3 months being completely secluded together. And there is one notable "scene" that calls this arrangement completely into question.\n\nAnyway, moving on. The controls were easy enough to use, so there's really nothing to say about them, though I kind of wish the game had a button to turn off the walkie talkies so Delilah would stop bugging me every 2 minutes.\n\nTo conclude: as a fun little interactive movie to sit through when you're relaxing on a lazy Sunday, this fits the bill perfectly. The selling point is the art style. As a game that's worth $20, it's no barn burner.\n\n7/10 even at a $5-10 price point.","February 9","false","3.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

That was me exploring every corner of the whole map. I kinda feel cheated on this aspect, not cool to advertise it as 6-7 hours when it's clearly not.\n\nThe map / landscape feels dead, there is honestly not much you can do other than just walking around and enjoying the scenery, theres not much wild life and almost no interactions other than silly "examine" this where you rotate objects etc and opening supply crates. No gameplay other than just walking around and proceeding with the simple story.\n\nStill i think the game is good enough but I can't justify €20 for such a short game, totally worth buying during a big sale and people who are intersted in the game should wait for one before buying.

Once I started playing I could not put it down. BUT:\n\nMinor spoiler alert:\n\nThere is NO action aspect to this game at all. No risk of dying or starving, no fighting, no running away, etc. There are a total of 5 people in the game that you interact with: your wife (only at the very beginning), Delilah (the woman on the walkie), the 2 "naked" teen girls that you get to see from the trailer(s), and one more which I will not talk about since it will ruin the entire story. None of these people will you ever see. You can hear them talking to you via different mediums, but you never see them. Not a big deal but I thought it was important enough to mention.\n\nNow here's what really disappointed me: The part with the girls at the beginning which was the footage they've been showing us for nearly a year is the ONE part of the game (unless I missed something, which I doubt I did because I have unlocked all 5 achievements already) where you have options of how you want to handle the situation. Other than that I was on a fixed track until they end of the game. Every senario was like this: "I need you to check ____ out", "ok, I'm heading down there", "oh no! wtf?!", "let's look into it", rinse and repeat. You do, however, have a lot of dialog choices but it was never really like: do this or don't do this/ agree or disagree, it was more like: straight answer or funny answer or no answer at all. None of these answers really seem to change the outcome.\n\nTo be fair the story is quite engaging and interesting and I playing from start to finish without stopping which took a total of about 4 hours. The ending, was... disappointing. I did not rush through it. I took the time to look in every little nook and cranny. I even got lost a few times and had to back track literally over more than half the map to get to my objective and it still did not take long at all. The map is also quite small and to make matters worse (in my opinion) at times you wouldn't even have to make it back to your tower. The day would just end and boom, the next day begins and you are magically back at your tower.\n\nI would only recommend this game as an alternative to seeing a movie in the theater, but not as a game. $10 = one movie, $20 = a four hour long game that is pretty much a movie. In that respect, it's fine... I guess.\n\nGraphics - 8\nGameplay - 3\nStory - 5\nPerformance - 9\nAtmosphere - 9\n\nWait until it's on sale..

I don't think I've ever sat alone in my room and gone through an emotional rollercoaster like that. The critics will say what they will but I get it. I get everything. All the things that people will inevitably complain about in this game is there for a reason. The developers have laid out an amazing, interactive and immersive story about a man who goes to seek solitude in the wilderness, and instead finds an outlet for his emotions. In the end, I would like to believe that Henry and I both found exactly what we were looking for. We discovered that being alone is not the same as being lonely and human interaction is what you make of it. There were times when the story was so tense, and there were times when it was heart wrenching, but I understand. It's there for a reason. All said, this piece of artful storytelling leaves you craving for more, but that's what good storytelling does. I will miss Delilah and I may even revisit this game again in the future, just to hear her voice and indulge in her wit. Great Job, I was definitely satisfied with this game.","February 10","true","5.2"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

The game is priced at £14.99. A press review copy was provided for The Hidden Levels.\n\nFirewatch is a first person action-adventure game set in the awesome Wyoming terrain. You play as a ‘Firefighter’ in which your job is to protect fires from starting and always being alert and vigilant to the terrain around you so that you prevent major fire accidents. The game goes way deeper than this though and you’re forced to make choices which can in tandem change the outcomes of the story.\n\n\nThings I liked:\n\nGraphics – The graphics on this game are gorgeous with the unique artstyle making exploring around the environments rewarding and fun. There have been times in game where I would just freeze and stare at the landscape.\n\nStory – The story starts straight away unique, playing like a visual novel for the first fifteen minutes of the game, giving you a deeper understanding of the main character and giving you a more intricate bond. I don’t want to give away too much because spoilers but the story is very hooking and addictive.\n\nMain character – I felt an instant connection with Henry and since the first conversation in the tower with Delilah (who is your supervisor in the game) enjoyed his humour and slight sarcasm to the full extent. He seems to be a very caring guy who tries to shrug everything off like he is laid back.\n\n\nThings I disliked:\n\nThrown in the deep end – The game slowly tries to edge you in but before you know it, you’re thrown in the wilderness and not a clue where to go if you miss some vital text. Once you get your feet back up from the floor and find out how the system works you then can start to progress further into the story.\n\nController options – The controller works great, when you’re using it and it still gives you the Keyboard buttons is what is not so great. There have been times when the keyboard buttons have come up on screen for me to be confused and have to press random buttons on the controller until I learn them.\n\n\nBeing alone is very scary and I was quick to learn this on Firewatch. The game is really unique and a breath of fresh air and I fully enjoyed being thrown from one life to another. Delilah really helps you along with everything and becomes your guardian angel almost and it is scary to think what it would be like without her (hehe).\n\nThe whole genre and game is new to me, I’ve not played much of the same type games for instance Long Dark, Kholat. If you enjoyed those games or are looking for a unique experience I can wholeheartedly say that this game is definitely worth it.\n\nScore: Buy it now!","February 9","true","5.6"," 146 of 266 people (55%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","55","146","266","10","8"

We felt a little cheated in the end and Unity attempted to turn my GPU to slag for the last 4 maps of the game.  Our bedroom got so hot we turned on a fan to cool it down because we began sweating. The endings we very much wanted to see and expected based on the gameplay did not happen and were not options. The finish was anticlimactic and unsatisfying.\n\nThe environments were beautiful but not immersive. I expected to encounter raccoons or other wildlife spoken about in the game but did not, also bears were alluded to but absent. In fact, I think there was only one visible NPC the character interacted with. Most environments didn't feel lonely or expansive, just empty or lacking polish, with modeling errors which broke the suspension of disbelief (tube steel modular construction on a 'communications tower with all kinds of equipment. ' which lacked any antennae, but had an anemometer. Textures, shaders, use of lights, and navigable terrain were good, but the rushed feel of 'hurry up and wait' didn't make us want to explore and enjoy the details. Most of the details looked like thinly disguised 'invisible walls' binding the player to a very small area.\n\nThe last third of the game felt rushed to meet a release deadline, the story was at times very depressing and the options for endings are sobering and pessimistic. This was enhanced by the contrast created by the serene natural environments which made me feel happy just long enough to feel bummed out or confused again. I wouldn't say I enjoyed it overall because of this. I feel worn out after playing, I want to go play something... fun and less sad. I wouldn't recommend it at full price.","April 11","false","12.3"," 48 of 83 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","48","83","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/383870/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","A Story or a Library?\nI began playing the game thinking it was not as good as The Long Dark… because of the scenery, you know? The scenery is great, but TLD is more so. But, as I played I soon realized it was nothing like TLD. Firewatch is unlike any game I’ve played. It is not like the text-based choice games I’ve played, and as one of my friends said, it’s not like the Tell-tale games. And, that reticle! It’s in your view from the time the game starts, until the end.\nI’d classify it as an adventure mystery game. It’s totally uncontrived. Everything you do and explore involves real-world exploration activities you might find in that environment, like in Stanley’s Parable. Instead of contrived puzzles, most of the game is spent using a map and a compass to navigate around a series of paths through a State Forest in Wyoming.\nThe dialogue is sensitive, and besides the f-bombs sprinkled throughout, various topics such as suicide are discussed. So it is not really a game for younger players. The dialogue uses quite a bit of foreshadowing. Their world is outside the real world, disassociated and cut off from phone lines. At times you are not sure whether to trust either character. But, you soon realize they both feel cut-off from the world; Henry by his wife’s loss of awareness, and Delilah by her inability to attach.\nIf you like mysteries, if you enjoy dialogue and rich story interactivity, if you ever took trips using a map and compass, or just wish you could; this game is probably for you. However, the game has numerous issues that may be problematic in the eyes of some “gamers.” I will be giving some spoilers, so you may choose to not read the rest of my review until after you’ve played the game.\nHenry’s wife is a college prof diagnosed with early onset Dementia. For various reasons he runs away from dealing with this, and ends up in the forest watching for fires. It seems he can’t deal with the loss of self-identity more than anything. While there, he falls into a routine of a radio conversation/romance with Delilah, another Firewatcher. It’s a definite source of comfort to him. But, he’s dealing with a lot of guilt over his wife who is living with her family back home. Ultimately he abandoned her. He has a run-in with some college girls/teens who are shooting off fireworks and skinny-dipping in the lake. One refers to him as just “a sad old man in the woods,” which hurts his feelings and tends to lead you to believe the girls are grad students and are recording their conversations and studying them. That never panned out in the ending I got.\nI felt the graphics were very well done, the drawing was beautiful, and the game played well, though it was quite linear. The mechanics were fun, and not forced. But most of the issues I found related to the story. Actually, I saw what I thought was a spoiler in the forum before the game was released. Some guy randomly announced that everything that happened was a figment of Henry’s imagination and that Delilah was not real. I was disappointed to have it spoiled before I even played, but soon found out I came up with a very different ending than that. I asked a few friends who played the game, and they all got the same ending I got. It certainly seemed to me that there were certain “collection points” where regardless of how you chose your answers, you were pulled back into the same story line with everyone else.\nSometimes, things happened the opposite of what you had chosen. For example, I told Deliah to go ahead and go when she asked if I minded. A friend told her to wait on him. In both games, she was gone when we got to her tower at the end of the game. It didn’t really seem to matter what you chose to say to her.  In the words of another friend, it seems that little things change, like how you describe yourself or dialog. (Thanks James!)  I would have preferred choices to make major changes in the endings.\nAnother issue I had with the story is that everything points you to conspiracy theories… the allusion to JFK on the cover of one book; the whole idea of government sponsored tests using radio signals, like with HAARP; and the mentions of Ronald Reagan’s policy of dealing (or not dealing) with forest fires.\nSo, there are a lot of easter eggs “littered” throughout the story… literally. Primarily, there are books skewed about everywhere you go, and the titles seem suggestive, if not a little familiar. But, only one had a name that I recognized for sure… Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. I believe most of the others were fake books to give hints the storywriter wanted to use to lead your thinking in a certain direction… toward conspiracy theories.\nThere were a number of books around the map by a Richard Sturgeon, who I’ve never heard of, but they all have numbers in their titles. Death Strikes at Two, Eight Rolled the Hard Way, The Fourth Estate, Terminal 7, One Chance to Die, Three Blind Rats, and Five Degrees North.\nOf course, the 4th estate is a term used in America to describe the media. Eight rolled the hard way would be rolling eight in a game of craps without getting doubles. It’s considered a hard roll, because there is only one way to roll it. The rest, your guess is as good as mine.\nOther books found include: The Singular Mind –Jonas Allard, Glory – Michelle MacManus, The Birds of Wyoming – George Sinclair, The Patriots – Donald Anderson, The Accidental Savior – Terrence Greenbriar, Jane Eyre- Charlotte Bronte and Black Band Comics.\nNotice that Jane Eyre is definitely a real book, though I’m not sure about the others. In Jane Eyre, the lead male character has a “crazy wife” who he has locked away and basically abandoned. He is trying to remarry, and experiences much guilt over this, much as Henry feels guilty over abandoning his wife in the game. Also, Delilah seems slippery, much like Jane Eyre, seeming to turn Henry away in the end, suggesting he go see his wife.\nThere were other things scattered throughout that seemed suggestive, but were certainly loose ends. The “Escape from Two Orcs Map” seemed to lead you to the idea that some evil force lurked in the forest. The Polyhedral dice (d20) similar to those from Dungeons & Dragons games only showed Bryan liked fantasy stories. Like the FireFinder  and Medicine Wheel, they just seemed to be included for atmosphere, perhaps to lend a reason for loving the forest, which goes up in blazes in a very dramatic conclusion.\nMany of the days are skipped automatically. To thoroughly explore all the items found in every location, you have to ignore the mission mentioned in the map until you are finished looking at everything. Otherwise you will jump ahead to the next day in the sequence.\nIt has a sad ending, and feels hollow. But, it plays beautifully, and you feel engaged throughout. There are a few additional features, like an in-game camera that will provide actual prints of the photos you take. I did not feel the need to buy the sound track in this game, though the music is nice.  I just felt it wasn’t used in the game very much. The sounds were mostly nature ambient sounds.\nI felt like the pieces were left unresolved. But, I would definitely play it again, simply because it was a lot of fun playing, and the conversations between characters (who you never see) are so real and personal, in a way that few other narrative games approach. It is certainly not an “Answers” story.\nWith all of that said, I do highly recommend the game. I loved it and spent a lot of time playing it. Most gamers seem to be completing it in just 3 to five hours. I spent over 20. But, I do not consider myself the average gamer. For all the reasons I mentioned, I think Firewatch may be more of a niche game with awesome graphics.","February 11","true","28.8"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","5"

In retrospect, that was an excellent decision as this was a quality game well worth peoples time.\n\nAlthough a walking simulator (a genre I already enjoy), the dialogue was outstanding, and as real life natural as it possibly could have been. The voice actors really did great work on this game. Visually, it was also a beautiful game, but in a more muted way than you might expect from a game that released within the last year. It was evocative, and really added to the story without getting in the story's way.\n\nIn every way, this was a thoughtful journey through mid life crisis and dramatic change in a pair of individuals lives, the way in which they tried to escape their realities, and the way they started to sort through their issues via communicating with each other over walkie talkie. The subplot, presented as the main plot throughout, was a mystery surrounding a stalker and possible murder(s). Although at the forefront, as I said, this was really the subplot, the main plot being one of self discovery through adversity and communication. A catharsis of the human spirit if you will.\n\nAll told, the game weighed in at about 4 hours, and I dont really feel that there is any replay value. However, the game was strong enough to be worth the asking price for a single 4 hour experience in my opinion, so strong was the writing and the character development.\n\nAs far as gameplay, fairly standard walking simulator/exploration game. Walk, run, jump, pick up and examine items. There is a photography feature offered about half way through the game, and that was a nice feature IMO.\n\nI have also heard complaints about the ending, but in my estimation, it ended exactly as it should have. There was really no where else to go while staying true to the story. I thought it worked perfectly.\n\nAll told, I would give this one 8 out of 10. Not epic material, but really good and worthwhile experience.","May 15","true","5.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","1"

At the beginning of the game you get to choose your characters backstory and from that moment on you get sucked up in the story.\nWhile you're out there in the woods your boss talks to you through your walkie-talkie. After a while it really feels like you build a relationship with your boss and the story can even get emotional at times. The story also has a few twists that make you think about the choices you made, and wonder how it is all connected\n\n\nOverall, i would highly recommend this game to everyone that likes story driven games, with beautiful environments.

Some of the climbing was in some ways a little tedious, but in otherways added a lot more deliberate-ness to the situation. It felt more... immersive. It was a tediousness that felt a part of the game rather than a flaw in it, which for me excused the issue. Other than that, I loved Firewatch.\n\nAnyway.\n\nFirewatch is a fantastic game overall. The choices are interesting and feel personable, the characters are relateable and instantly likeable, and feel like real 3D people with great depth.\n\nAnd that's really what Firewatch is about. People. It is almost entirely about your interaction with the Voice At The End Of The Radio. Other than that, there are people around that, that affect the situation and the topic and your responses to the VATEOTR, who are always on your character's mind, and in turn, on your mind, but ultimately it is about your interaction with this one, other person.\n\nAnd it is fascinating. It's so enjoyable to talk with her. Her responses are real and sometimes funny and I laughed and I cried and I enjoyed the game all the way through. At the time of writing I finished the story in about four hours, but I will definitely be playing it again, and it was four hours well spent.\n\nOne of my favourite parts which sets almost the entire mood for your conversation with the VATEOTR, is the scenery. The world you're put in is absolutely gorgeous, and an absolute constant pleasure to be in. It is styleized in such a gorgeous way that makes the game feel truly authentic.\n\nIn essence, I loved Firewatch, and I will play it again.\n\n10/10","February 16","true","3.1"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

So great, in fact, that many gamers (including myself) at times wanted it to breach the walls and actually have more 'gaming' elements. This game really has the whole package; the artwork, music, voice acting, animation and atmosphere are all expertly crafted. The storyline is moving, to say the least.\n\nThe two major shortcomings in my mind are 1) the game is quite short (3 hours to 'finish' the story), and 2) there is little replay value. I will elaborate on both.\n\nAlthough the twenty dollar price tag has become fairly standard for quality walking simulators (a la Gone Home or Dear Esther, among others), you only get a measly few hours of enjoyment out of it. The hours are top quality, though. After I was done, I kept asking myself why they couldn't have added in more achievements or side quests to fill out the time and add more incentive to replay. Sure, there are little 'easter eggs' of sorts littered throughout the map, but its certainly not enough for me to justify the large-ish price tag. Achievements would incentivize this; for example, I earned all the achievements in my first 3 hour playthrough.\n\nBeyond that, everything is great. The story is wonderful and the experience is divine.  Just realize that this is a walking simulator proper. They may tease you with finding an axe, but there is no game here. Thats ok, but I think some of us wanted it to go to that next level.\n\nIt was most likely created to be a short experience on purpose, though. For example, while the map feels large and sandboxy at first, it quickly shows that it is quite limited. Once again, thats ok, but it merits being mentioned. The map is not as open-world as it may have us think. Its a series of 'tunnels'. Very beautiful tunnels.\n\nPros:\n+Stunning artwork and scenery\n+Truly great voice acting\n+Outstanding story-telling\n+Music is excellent\n+Its short, but what is there is powerful\n\nCons:\n-Its short, with a fairly steep price-tag (albeit par for the genre)\n-I wanted more 'game', but thats like asking for more guns in Minecraft (hey devs take that as a compliment, because you really made something wonderful that could go in any direction)\n-The map really needs more life added. I didn't see a single bug-swarm for example. I could go on and on about this, but you get the idea.\n\nWalking simulator fans really need to play this for the experience. Even with only 3 hours of play time at this moment, I don't regret a single dollar spent.","February 11","true","6.7"," 34 of 58 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","34","58","4","4"

Easily summarised: Flat, boring and a complete waste of high-quality resources with potential gone to the trashbin.\n\nPRO's:\n\n- Excellent graphics\n- Superb voice-acting\n- Engaging story for the first hour\n\nCON's:\n\n- Downright boring gameplay. Nothing to do, except to interact with hike objects that might as well have been automated\n- Illusion of free choice and liberty: It's all linear, nothing turns out different and you will meet dead ends all the time.\n- Emotionless ending that completely destroys everything you listened or walked for around.\n- Pricey for its length (just a little tad, it's not a heavy con IMO, we've just been lied to).\n\nI cannot recommend it, especially for story-driven gamers.

There is literally nothing to figure out, you're told exactly where to go at all times. All you need to do is use your compass and look at your map.\n\nI beat the game in 3.5 hours because I was exploring dead-end paths (the game is extremely lineer but trys to hide it by making convulted pathways you get stuck in). There are no collectables, there is nothing to discover or explore outside of the main quest. Had I known the game was like this, I probably could have beat it under 2.5 hours no problem.\n\nThe story is actually not good, and has very little pay off, not to mention extremely unplausable.\n\nI would not pay more than $10 for this game, even that is kind of a stretch.","February 9","false","4.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Like a Visual Novel intro but in a beautiful sequence yet sad tale.If I were to tell you how the game looks like and acts like, imagine Life is Strange combine with The Long Dark and Stanley Parable.

You find notes that the game allows you to keep and seemingly collect as "evidence", but you'll never use them, so I'm not sure what the point is other than to play mind games as to what the story's twist will be.\n\nOnce you hit the twist, there's a reveal, but no confrontation, so its more of an "oh, that's what it was" moment, instead of the "holy ****" moment I think I was expecting.\n\nMaybe get it on sale if you feel like checking it out, but, apart from the fantastic voice acting, the writing here is just dull.\n\n\n**EDIT**:\n\nOkay, I've played it again to see if focusing less on the mystery aspects improve my experience, and I still feel the same about this game.\n\nThe biggest problem with the writing is that there are essentially two plotlines that both go nowhere satisfying - one concerning the mystery aspect that is more about personal paranoia, and the other concerning Henry.\n\nHenry is there because his wife has dementia and he's unable to cope. This thread seems to be there to establish Henry's character, but, honestly, none of the dialogue I ran across in the game touched on this in any depth. Sure, you can bring it up, but, beyond a sentence, the game does nothing with this idea. Replay the game again. It plays the exact same if Henry and his wife are just going through marriage problems and are spending time apart.\n\nHis wife being diagnosed with dementia comes off as a cheap move to pull on the player's heartstrings and possibly endear them to Henry, but its a theme with no exploration.\n\nHenry clearly has trouble dealing with his wife's illness - in my first playthrough, he tried to take care of her himself and ended up sneaking out to go to bars and drown his sorrow.\nApart from the text blurb at the beginning, that's all you get on how Henry actually feels about his wife.\nI agree that the story didn't have to be an epic mystery, but I would think the mystery was supposed to be a vehicle to explore Henry's demons.

A nice relaxing story, with some real characters and believable events.\n\nIt has been tagged a "walking simulator"... yes I guess that is true, a lot of what you do is go on hikes, but it is not onerous.\n\nThe art style is great, sound is great, nice atmosphere, good characters.\n\nI found it refreshing that I didn't have to invest 20+ hours in a game... The price point was about right for quality of this, effectively the price of a trip to the cinema and the effort that has gone into this by the developer is evident.\n\nLet's be honest, there will be negative reviews about everything.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone open to an enjoyable, accessible story.\n\nAs I frequently say in my reviews....

But I have a deep well of dissatisfaction concerning its single unchanging plotline. Let's be frank here, there are indications there was more to the story and the developers copped out. Sold the story and real effort down the river for a game that barely passes the refund playtime mark.\n\n**Spoilers ahead**\n\nThe story was alright for what it was, it had some very interesting twists, but it should have been more. The evidence for this is the fenced off area and Ned supposedly set up this whole conspiracy social experiment thing... to what? scare them away from finding his son's body? But he treks all this chain fence and super expensive radio tower equipment himself? That he buys weird tracking devices and leaves them in a way that leads to two lost packs with the keys to the cave he stole 3 years ago?\n\nAll of that. That's not realistic. His actions are what set Hank on the trail to find the kid's body in the first place. If Ned had kept the cave keys on him... or not carried his clipboard of notes away from the ham radio setup he used to eavesdrop... or setup a campsite with tracking devices that you leave transponders for with your super important backpacks. WTF is this developer doing that he thinks I believe all these objects and assets were not part of some part of the story that got scrapped?\n\nHey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, if you are reading this you could have done so much more with this game and you know it. I hope you feel like ♥♥♥♥ about its wasted potential, it's OBVIOUS wasted potential.\n\nThe best thing you could have done was at least had a twist at the end. D's tower could have been obviously someone else's tower. You could ask they guy on the chopper where she went and he could have said some other person's name that worked there. Or you could have had a dinosaur fossil in the cave that ned discovered and a backstory about how he was trying to cope with not wanting to get or famous from leading people to his son's body.\n\nYou heavily implied the tracking devices and observation material could suggest tracking bigfoot in a few ways. That would have been cheesy and far fetched, but anything is better than this half ♥♥♥♥♥ attempt to cover up your laziness.","February 9","false","4.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You'll not. There are no dangers, no challenges, no wildlife. This is a walking simulator, pure and simple. The story goes on as you walk and barely interact with the environment using clunky keyboard controls.\n\nThe beginning atmosphere is perfect, graphics are awesome, the dialogs are very well acted, but all the story buildup archs and expectations turn out to be absolutely pointless in the end. They lead to nothing. Also, the story is really simple, and according to the reviews I've read, It doesn't matter which dialog options you choose because there are no story branches. I can't be bothered to sluggishly walk/run through the same environments back and forth just to listen to a set of slightly different dialogs.\n\nI beat this in 5 hours, but I don't care if a game is short, as long as it makes up for it in other respects.

The gameplay mainly consists of walking around looking for stuff, so don't expect any skill-based gameplay, but obviously it's not about that. Still, it's enjoyable all the same, thanks to the incredibly beautiful environments. Seriously, the art direction in this game is wonderful.\n\nThe story is told mainly through radio conversations with Delilah, another watcher. The voice acting and dialogue is superb, it's a real treat to listen to (and you very frequently get varied options for responses), and the story itself is really gripping. It's full of mystery and it feels like you have personal stakes in the events, nothing like those certain other games where all you do is plod around some dump and listen to recordings. The fact that the game makes you feel like you're solving something, without actually having any puzzles in it, is a testament to the writing quality. Sure, the story as a whole has issues and doesn't quite end as satisfyingly as one might want, but it more than makes up for it in the minutiae of how it's told.\n\nThe story takes about 5-6 hours (if you try to take in the game a bit rather than trying to speedrun it...), really well paced so that it neither outstays its welcome nor gives you too little time. By the end, you'll be intimately familiar with both the surroundings and Delilah.","February 10","true","6.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

You're looking through the eyes of Henry: wearily middle-aged and about to begin a summer stint as a firewatch ranger in a national park. Your boss, Delilah, introduces herself over the handheld radio. She is, to put it politely, an oddball; sarcastically intrusive but good-humoured and well meaning. Your relationship with her will become one of the most engrossing ever mapped out in gaming to date.\n\nTo state what might not be so obvious to some, yes, Firewatch can't claim to be much outside of a walking simulator for the most part. It's far bigger than most, rewards extensive exploration and you won't be able to experience every path if you just rush from objective to objective. There won't be any gunfights or QTEs to mash your way through. You are largely just holding a series of conversations with a disembodied voice on the other side of the radio.\n\nThat really makes what Firewatch accomplishes all the more impressive. It manages to conjure moments of hilarity, poignancy and skin-crawling intensity through little more than some hazy silhouettes, discarded camping equipment and an unbelievably well written and award-worthy acted script.\n\nThe ending's a bit soggy, be warned, but if you're somebody like me who's forever bemoaning the state of dialogue, voice acting and story pacing in gaming, prepare to be astonished.\n\nI covered the first couple of chapters a few days ago in the preview copy.

Your only other human interaction is through a two-way radio with your supervisor. On your first day, you spot some careless campers setting off fireworks, and head out to set things straight, which starts the beggining of a rather engrossing story.\n\nThe gameplay is very, very bland. It's a walking simulator with lots of dialogue. While the atmosphere is very peaceful and beautiful, it serves as a pleasant distraction for the fact that this isn't really a typical "game". There's no dangerous wildlife to defend yourself from, or hunger/thirst mechanics. You walk to various checkpoints to trigger story events, and sometimes find new gear to unlock new areas to wander around in. Several times I found myself getting turned around and trying to travel somewhere, but invisible, or non-logical barriers often kept me from doing so (Beacuse I wasn't walking on the "intended" path).\n\nThe game LOOKS pretty, and cleverly calls you out on some of your actions. I found a small, abandoned shovel that my character was informed was for burying your crap. My character was disgusted, and asked himself "Why am I still holding it?!", and after a few more moments after I didn't drop it, asked again "I'm still holding it!!"\n\nMy other main complaint is that the game is INCREDIBLY sparse. Aside from the odd butterfly, I only encountered two animals, both of which were just scripted events. Theres no deer, or bunnies, or foxes running about and the world feels very empty.\n\nAfter finishing the game (In around three hours), I felt very unsatisfied. The story didn't pan out quite as interesting as I'd been lead to believe it would. Some sources claim that there's multiple endings, which is not really true. There IS a second, alternate ending that triggers if you simply wait around for five minutes or so and don't walk to the object you're instructed to. The only difference is about five seconds of cutscene.\n\nIn conclusion, it IS a fun game, but the pricetag is absolutely ridiculous.

When I saw previews for this game months ago, I kept it on my radar because it looked FANTASTIC.  The premise of a story-drive narrative in a gorgeous world really drew me in.  And it did deliver, on some parts.  I think the game looks amazing, though frame hiccups were prevelant and slightly annoying, and the voice acting between Hank and Delilah was top-notch, with great witty dialogue.  However there's not really much dialogue, not much of anything at all to be frank.  There are a few cute diversions, such as digging through ranger bins or finding a turtle or a burned shack ( which literally nothing is said about...no back story, no point at all from what I could tell )...but by the end, all these little nuances that I had been filing away for the end to see how they measured up instead began to give me a stark, depressing realization...they had no point whatsoever.\n\nWhat should have been factoids that added to the overall story instead, at the end of my 3.5 hour journey ( I paused and took an hour for dinner ), felt like just enough added weight to hold me over the 2-hour refund limit.  No, I'm not being overly dramatic...I honestly think most of the extras in this game are just there to make sure you cannot get your money back.  The story climaxes in a very oddball, unoriginal way with a paltry plot point and an abysmal ending that just sorta...happens and leaves you there with nothing to show for it.  I paid 20 dollars for a 3.5 hour game that gave me nothing in return, not even a good wrap-up of the meager story I had invested in.\n\nSo no, I would not recommend this game at all.  You can literally go onto youtube and watch a full playthrough of it that ends at somewhere short of the 3-hour mark and get all the story, all the ambiance, and miss absolutely NOTHING in the process except a 20 dollar bill...I hate sounding petty, but I am reporting this to Steam and petitioning for a refund.","February 10","false","4.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are times when you can get absorbed with taking in the scenery, and others where the scenery is blurring by as Firewatch dials up the tension. Even the casual controls help keep your mind off what your hands are doing, and focussed on what you're experiencing.\n\nI've seen a lot of complaints that it's short (I finished in just under 5 hours), but there's no point to dragging it out. The narative is what is presented, not the mechanics. Would I say it's "a fun game?" Maybe not.

This game isn't worth the asking price right now; you'd be better watching it on YouTube. Firewatch doesn't have any real gameplay elements; it is as many would say a walking simulator; however you don't play a game like this for the gameplay, you play a game like this for the story; this is one of the games' strong points and also its weakest... This games' story is very interesting; the execution is perfect and combined with the isolated setting it quickly pulls you into the story and gets you immersed into the story, around half-way through the game is when stuff gets really interesting and will really hook you in... The ending however is very disappointing; now there might be some alternate ending but after reading other forum posts and watching others it appears there is only one. There is all this build-up for nothing...\n\nThe voice acting is excellent; it's one of those games where I wanted to hear every piece of dialogue just because every scenario was done so well; both characters feel natural - The voice acting doesn't feel forced, cheap or cheesy. It can be witty, serious or depressing depending on what you choose in-game. It should be noted what you choose in no way affects what actually happens in the game, you will just get different dialogue - All outcomes are the exact same, unless there is a secret ending but as I said there probably isn't.\n\nA lot of people complain this game is quite short and I can see why; many users are reporting 2-4 hours (which seems to be the average) - It took me 4 hours, mainly because the map in this game is so annoying to use and navigate with, I got lost all the time. The world itself has many different routes, shortcuts and areas that can only be accessed certain ways... Combined with the awfully confusing map which sometimes just seems to change at random this means it can take 10-20 minutes just to find a certain area or navigate back to your tower. This only added frustration to my playthrough.\n\nI like the voice acting, and the story did show promise but I cannot recommend anyone to pick this game up right now - Watch it on YouTube or wait for it go get really cheap in a sale; if a friend has it ask for a family share but it simply isn't worth the asking price - Especially considering most will beat it in 2-4 hours (speedrun record is currently 1 hour) and there isn't any replay value; not unless someone does find some secret ending or extra story stuff comes out.","February 13","false","5.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The third most popular tag for the game at the moment is "Walking Simulator", and while I'm sure there's no mistaking the game for anything else but that based on how it was marketed, be certain that you know that before buying it and expecting something entirely different.\n\nThe length of Firewatch isn't even the issue. If the game were much longer than it was, I'm afraid I would have never been able to force myself through to the very end. The characters and story are uninteresting, and yes, while I did know I was buying into a walking simulator, the gameplay's uninteresting as well. They marketed this game as something I wanted to watch the first trailer of, and then go on a news blackout for. They told us there was some big underlying mystery. Maybe I thought it would turn into some sort of horror game. Maybe even if not some mysterious creature prowling through the woods, watching, waiting, something at least interesting enough to slog through the repetitive objective of walking from point A to point B, then back to point A so you can acquire something that will allow you to get to point C.\n\nA majority of the three hours it took me to complete the game was spent watching mountain climbing animations, and walking around because during particular segments your character forgot how to run. And that's just if you can make it past the frustrating opening of the game, wherein the game tricks you into thinking you're playing the role of a character, rather than simply viewing the world through his eyes. The game repeatedly refers to "You". It says that "You" did this. That "You" said this. When in fact the options to choose from play absolutely no part in anything that happens, and likely aren't even decisions you would make as a real person in real life, because the character is stuck-up and has a completely unrelatable personality.\n\nIn the end, you're left with 3 hours of walking around in the forest, anticipating a decent conclusion to make up for the rest of the game, and finding out that because the entire game was based on a single painting the developers happened to like, whoever was responsible for writing the story never actually knew where they were going with anything. This feels like episode 1 to a Telltale game, where they were told near the end of its development that it wouldn't be receiving any further episodes, so they had to wrap it up as quickly as they could while still pushing the game out the door at the date they had originally promised.\n\nThe Good    Visually appealing.\nSometimes interesting dialogue between the two main characters.\nThe Bad    Uninteresting story that wraps up more poorly than any recent story-driven game I can think of.\n$20 for 3 hours of gameplay. Even a single piece of DLC for The Witcher 3 was half that price, more than 5 times the length, and a thousand times more interesting. Can't think of another game I recently bought that had a worse price to value ratio. And yes, while comparing anything to The Witcher 3 will likely leave you disappointed, Layers of Fear, an early access title for the same price, with the same general concept of being a walking simulator, was also a lot more interesting in its current unfinished state than Firewatch will ever be.\nPerformance is lackluster, especially because the game, while visually appealing, isn't doing anything above and beyond in the visuals department. It uses Unity Engine, and the performance is likely the result of that combined with the fact that developers behind the Telltale Walking Dead games had their hand in this. Telltale games are well known for shoddy performance.\nGameplay is boring. Get told where to go. Go there. Do thing. Screen fades to black. Wake up sometime in the future. Repeat. I'm not asking for guns. I'm not asking for a leveling system. I'm asking for a game where I'm not actually worried about whatever's rustling the bushes behind me, because I know the developers couldn't be bothered with modeling and texturing anything but environment assets.\nWhen it isn't stuttering along, there's various glitches like the audio cutting out randomly, and at one point I was faced with a glitch I've only ever seen in Minecraft where a large portion of the forest decided to not be there anymore, leaving a massive void of empty space.\nI legitimately have to launch the game and idle it in order to get the rest of my card drops out of it, because the game isn't long enough on its own to drop them all for me, and has absolutely no replay value.","February 14","false","3.0"," 46 of 85 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","46","85","2","0"

I trust this because I don't feel I've been effectively equipped to deal with a bear. And I trust this because I know that modeling and animating and programming a bear is a lot of work, and if Campo Santo had put a bear in Firewatch then there would probably be a bear in Firewatch's trailers.\n\nBut an hour ago, my offscreen boss Delilah asked me to keep an eye out for bear tracks in the area, and now I'm inching through a cave, terrified that I'm about to come face to face with a horrible grizzled grizzly.\n\n---\n\nFirewatch is a tricky game to describe. It's not exactly a Gone Home, not exactly a The Walking Dead, and not exactly a Far Cry 2. But all those elements are in its DNA, and they combine to create something intriguing, memorable, and extraordinary.\n\nDon't listen to anyone who says Firewatch is a walking simulator. If anything, I'd call it a talking simulator. The core mechanic—communication with an unseen colleague via a handheld radio—functions something like a combination of The Walking Dead's timed conversations and Dishonored's Heart, and serves not only to advance the plot but also to provide color and humor and a degree of player expressivity.\n\nI won't say much about the plot here, as it is hard to do so without treading into spoiler territory. It's a mystery story, and a story about the relationship between a man and a woman. In both regards, the worldbuilding is exceptional: the principal characters play off each other well, and there is a real tension while the mystery is sustained. The worst I can say about Firewatch is that I wish I could spend longer in this remote part of Wyoming. The first half of the game feels like the greatest TV pilot in years, and the second half is like fast-forwarding to the series finale.\n\n---\n\nI loved everything about Firewatch. The gorgeous art, the stellar voice acting, the beautiful yet disquieting soundtrack. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys narrative-driven games.\n\nJust watch out for that bear.\n\n[Disclosure: I used to work with one of Campo Santo's developers and have hung out with a lot of the team at industry events.]","February 9","true","4.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The ending is paramount. It's purpose is to give meaning to the events that happened before it.\n\nFirewatch's ending does not do that. It is without a doubt in my mind, the single worst ending to an otherwise enjoyable game I've ever seen.\n\n\nBut let's start out with the positive.\n\n+This game is simply stunning. The art style and color palette are so fitting for a game like this.\n+The dialogue is incredible. For a game that's only dialogue is between two different characters, it all feels fresh and real. There's also a suprising amount of choice within dialogue.\n+What's equally incredible is the voice acting. Both Rich Sommer and Cissy Jones are fantastic and make you feel like Henry and Delilah are both real people really talking about real things.\n+The game really kicks off early. You WILL begin to feel paranoid that something isn't quite right with what's happening around you.\n\nAnd now onto the cons.\n\n-A lot of your time will be spent backtracking. This isn't all bad considering that you're generally always talking with Delilah, but considering that the game is under 4 hours long, it's not really acceptable that about a third of that time is spent going through the same places.\n-Gameplay is almost none existent. Yes I understand that this is a story based experience and I am completely fine with that. But it is worth noting that if you were expecting any gameplay that poses any form of a challenge, you will not find it here.\n-I saw like 3 animals across 80 days in the woods. What?\n\n\nNow onto the elephant in the room. The ending. No spoilers.\n\nWell yes, I suppose this is technically a mystery game. But you don't really solve it. The suspense grows and grows until eventually you are just handed the answer of "who dun it" with what is supposed to be an emotional gut punch. But all it really is, is a cop out. All the paranoia you felt for the last 3 hours just completely disapears and you realise how truly pointless the game is. It doesn't deliver upon the quality that it started out with in any form.\n\nWhere was the character development? What did the character learn about himself from his time in the woods with another woman? What happens next? The answer to all of these questions is left up to the player to decide. Which isn't a bad thing, but doesn't at all play to the strengths of the game.\n\n\nTLDR- An ending that doesn't live up to the quality set by everything before it.\n\n4/10\n\n","February 9","false","3.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Its hard to explain, but Ill give it a shot.\n\nIt almost feels like Campo Santo decided to lay down a basic outline about how the game was going to be developed... and then decided to just stop there, as if the first draft was just fine. The gameplay, the level design, the storyline were all borderline basic. One example is how they force the player into a "point of no return" in which the player must find an object to progress in the game ( the axe, the piton). This is okay at first because it teaches the player the necessity of these items the next time they encounter such obstacle later in the game. The problem is that those obstacles are never encountered EVER AGAIN. You wont ever have to use the axe, nor the pitons to any further extent. The mystery about the two girls vanishing is well established at first becuase it gives the player the sense of consequence from his actions (throwing the boom box into the lake, telling Delilah what she should say to the police), leading the player to believe that there are repurcussions in the future. To my dissapointment, no matter how you interact/ what you say, it does not affect the plot in any grand way. This mystery was only an element of the main mystery.\n\nThe main mystery itself hooks you in because it adds the sense of danger and vulnerability for someone who is wandering alone in the woods, who can only interact with a stranger via radio chatter. It sets up the expectation for something extraordinary, something dangerous, perhaps even something life changing. But after discovering the truth behind all the strangeness it kinda leaves you saying "oh...okay then". I can only assume that the the mystery was an element to move or advance the development between the two characters: Henry and Delilah.\n\nIts without a doubt that the characters and how they interact with one another is the highlight of the game, and perhaps whole the point. The main protagonist, Henry, after a troubling history in managing his relationship with his afflicted wife, escapes into the wilderness to run away from his relational issues. Delilah, to a certain degree, is in the same boat as Henry. They interact with eachother throughout the story, each one flipping through the other's story, almost as if they were trying to solve eachother's problem. They are stuck in this internal state of limbo (metaphorically speaking their isolation in the park) not knowing where to go next in their lives. For a breif moment they find solace in eachother because Henry and Delilah understand eachother, but through natural events (the convergence of the two fires that threatens to spread in their area) they are forced to act once again. It subtly acknowledges the severity of being forced to a difficult decision in life, even though most of the interaction in the game leads to nothing consequential. (Funny, isnt it?)\n\nMaybe Firewatch wouldve been better adapted as a novel. I would like to believe that the character interaction and introspection is the true purpose of this game, because if  not then this game is simply lackluster in every single aspect. Unfortunately, Campo Santo decided to advertise this game as an exploration-filled, vast open world mystery title. Im afraid this title will receive the same fate as Gone Home, but with less controversy.\n\nSave your money and get this on a 50%-75% sale.

Really wanted it to be good. And it is good, at certain things. The first hour or so of the game is wonderful, thanks to the chemistry between Henry and Delilah. It's some of the best writing and voice acting I've seen in a long time.\n\nThen it turns into an episode of the X-Files, and all the chemistry between the two leads vanishes.\n\nI'm not going to spoil what twists and turns the story takes. Instead, I'll point out that the story starts out great and ends up falling flat, largely because of two things:\n\n1. The pacing. The game starts with a slow burn. You're learning about the two characters, about the world, and occasionally a weird thing here, a weird thing there. That's fine. Then, all of a sudden, there is an abrupt turn into crazytown. I felt like I was just starting to settle into the groove of Hank 'n Delilah, when all hell breaks loose. Suddenly Hank and Delilah are bemoaning [spoilery thing I won't mention] plaguing them ALL SUMMER LONG, and I'm like "Wait, what? All summer? It was Day 2 of summer ten minutes ago. Then you jumped to Day 30 something, then Day 40 something, and now we're here." The game doesn't actually build a solid foundation between Hank and Delilah; it pulls the equivalent of "Two months later..." and expects that time to add weight to the proceedings. It doesn't. You can't just skip months of time and then have the characters say "Oh, all that time we've spent together" as if it means something. It doesn't.\n\n2. The quality of the writing. The first hour is phenomenal. Hank and Delilah have charmingly awkward conversations about their pasts, about the job. You have opportunities to press a little, or hold back, and you begin to shape your relationship with this total stranger who is also your only lifeline. Once the game takes the aforementioned sharp turn into crazytown, though, every conversation basically becomes:\n\nHank: I found a thing.\nDelilah: You found a thing?! What the hell? Are you sure it's a thing?\nHank: I am certain it's a thing.\nDelilah: I can't believe it's a thing. I don't like this, Hank.\nHank: I don't like it either. I'm going to keep looking.\nDelilah: We've got to find out about the thing.\n\nRelationship building? Basically gone. Character development? Not so much. Sense of humor? Vanished. As soon as the plot kicks in, the core pillar of this game - the relationship between Hank and Delilah - is sucked dry of everything that made it interesting. As soon as the story takes center stage, they become a *stunningly* boring pair.\n\nI don't even care about the actual plot. Weird stuff happens, more weird stuff happens, you're given a seemingly plausible explanation for some of it, the end. By the time the credits ran, I couldn't have cared less about any of it; I was still just wondering what had happened to those interesting characters I met in the first hour, and why they were replaced with Blandy McBlanderton and the Blandtime Band.\n\nWhat a waste. So much potential, and the developers clearly know how to write compelling characters; I just can't understand why they would abandon those characters to focus on a completely run-of-the-mill story instead.","February 9","false","4.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

For a completely story driven game, there is no payoff and no resolution of any kind. Everything is wrapped up in the last 10 minutes in a shockingly uninspired way. Considering how well done the writing was up until the end, it feels like the last half hour was heavily rushed causing the story to fall flat... it almost feels like an "Episode 1".\n\nThis is one of those cases where a simple "Yes/No" review isn't really appropriate. I'd like a middle ground here. All I can really say is that I don't feel that I got my $18 out of this game. If more work was put into the ending scenario of this game, I'd likely be singing its praises... as it stands, I'm just disappointed.","February 10","false","3.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I trust this because I don't feel I've been effectively equipped to deal with a bear. And I trust this because I know that modeling and animating and programming a bear is a lot of work, and if Campo Santo had put a bear in Firewatch then there would probably be a bear in Firewatch's trailers.\n\nBut an hour ago, my offscreen boss Delilah asked me to keep an eye out for bear tracks in the area, and now I'm inching through a cave, terrified that I'm about to come face to face with a horrible grizzled grizzly.\n\n---\n\nFirewatch is a tricky game to describe. It's not exactly a Gone Home, not exactly a The Walking Dead, and not exactly a Far Cry 2. But all those elements are in its DNA, and they combine to create something intriguing, memorable, and extraordinary.\n\nDon't listen to anyone who says Firewatch is a walking simulator. If anything, I'd call it a talking simulator. The core mechanic—communication with an unseen colleague via a handheld radio—functions something like a combination of The Walking Dead's timed conversations and Dishonored's Heart, and serves not only to advance the plot but also to provide color and humor and a degree of player expressivity.\n\nI won't say much about the plot here, as it is hard to do so without treading into spoiler territory. It's a mystery story, and a story about the relationship between a man and a woman. In both regards, the worldbuilding is exceptional: the principal characters play off each other well, and there is a real tension while the mystery is sustained. The worst I can say about Firewatch is that I wish I could spend longer in this remote part of Wyoming. The first half of the game feels like the greatest TV pilot in years, and the second half is like fast-forwarding to the series finale.\n\n---\n\nI loved everything about Firewatch. The gorgeous art, the stellar voice acting, the beautiful yet disquieting soundtrack. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys narrative-driven games.\n\nJust watch out for that bear.\n\n[Disclosure: I used to work with one of Campo Santo's developers and have hung out with a lot of the team at industry events.]","February 9","true","4.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Except when you're not alone.\n\nFirewatch adds some menace and mystery to typical walking simulator fare and tries to make the Wyoming wilderness feel more real. Your UI is you literally holding up a map and compass; your dialogue requires you to hold radio buttons like you might in real life. It makes slight concessions to accessibility by adding text readouts of notes you'd otherwise have to squint at and giving a real-time "you are here" marker on your map, but for the most part, Firewatch tries to eschew artificiality and really immerse you into the role. For the most part, it succeeds.\n\nWhere it doesn't succeed as much is story. Oh there's great characterization and wonderful moments that evoke powerful feelings. But the story itself feels strange and disjoint, and by the end of Firewatch's scant 5 hours, it feels like frankly very little has been resolved, and the stuff that has isn't necessarily resolved to satisfaction. There's a really excellent allegory tied up in the whole thing about fire management, forest fires, etc. and how they reflect on protagonist Hank's reasons for being in the Shoshone National Forest, but a really well-executed allegory in a story that feels rushed on its nuts and bolts is a strange thing. One can't help but get the feeling some much more satisfying story threads were in the works and when a release was just around the corner, they kind of got tied together into one of the *less* compelling story threads just to give it all a clean end.\n\nI don't mean to bust Firewatch's balls too hard. It's fundamentally a good game with beautiful visuals, a really nice sense of peace and solitude early on, and it's wonderfully immersive.  I just can't help but feel like these characters, these mechanics, and this fantastic setting could support quite a bit more than we got.","February 11","true","8.6"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","19","33","0","2"

Well, out of these... yes, the graphics are quite pretty stylized, that's it. It has very little to do with mountains or even fire-watching. The fire-watchers in this game don't use hatchets, binoculars, or compass, and they come to mountains for entertainment and use the same language they talked in their big city bars... The story told by Firewatch hasn't enriched the world much, either (but has hooks for you such as mentally ill loved ones or text-based intro).\n\nEventually the whole thing falls flat with inconsistent, silly story and lack of both research and polish. Ultimately it is all about nice packaging and smart marketing (or should I say luring - how to name speaking to such low fantasies as phone sex, err, "adult conversations about adult things"?). Most games are, true, but then - they don't aspire to be art. Firewatch explicitly does. If we want games to be treated as art, let's review them as art.

You play as a man named Henry, who due to unexpected circumstances finds himself taking a job as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness.\n\nWhile I am recommending this game, before you make the decision to purchase or not please keep in mind that it's very short. It took me 4.5 hours to complete - half an hour longer than most people are reporting. It’s worth playing, but I'd wait and get it at a discount unless you have cash to spare.\n\nFirewatch is an interactive story. You progress by exploring the environment and using a handheld radio to communicate. How you choose to respond to dialogue effects how the person on the other end of the radio responds to you in return.\n\nA lot of love went into this game and it shows. They did a very good job of making everything in a particular setting (music, lighting, background, ambient noise) work towards the mood and general theme of the overarching story. The graphics are outstanding. The voice acting is superb and the dialogue is, in my opinion, probably the strongest part of the game. After spending time on various Telltale products I particularly like the way the controls are set up and the fact that you can save at any point while playing.\n\nThe overarching plot isn’t perfect - I’m still not sure how I feel about the twist, but after some consideration I think it fits with what the game was going for. The writing works hard to make you feel increasingly isolated and paranoid while playing, but still manages to keep the beauty of the environment and being out in the wild at the forefront of the story. It feels like walking through a strange, hard section of someones life.

A mix of simplistic and the complex, throw in some warm color pallets on top of that with some great looking backdrops and sky boxes and it's a fantastic looking game.\nBut not only does the game look great, the atmosphere is incredible, the mix of emotions this game will throw at you from sadness, to a sense of comfort, to then paranoia, this game digs deep in these emotions and tries to make a point of topic out of them.\n\nThe game is also just packed with a ton of little details and charm, from the items you pick up around the environment, to the dialogue between Henry and Delilah.\n\nWhich brings up probably my favorite aspect of this game; the voice acting.\nIt's easily some of the best voice work I've heard in a long time in a video game, the chemistry between both characters and the dialogue is absolutely fantastic.\n\nThis of course is aided by top talent handling the voice work; Henry being played by Rich Sommer of Mad Men fame and Cissy Jones as Delilah.\n\nOn top of great voice acting, the soundtrack is pretty solid as well, there isn't any ambient music through out the game, but at key moments in the story the music does kick in setting the tone nicely through out the game.\nAs for the story itself, for me personally it's a mixed bag, the firs two acts of the game in my opinion are fantastic, the introduction sets up Henry's back story, as well as letting you choose different options in the prologue that can effect certain conversations and choices you make through out the game.\n\nThe story starts off simple enough, picking up after rowdy campers, picking up supply drops, and honestly these simple segments were probably my favorite part of the story, but then things quickly shift gear and things start becoming a bit weird without giving anything away....\n\n\n\n---The Bad---\n\n-Ending fell flat for me personally (minor/subjective opinion, a few other people I spoke with enjoyed it)\n-Environments/paths became repetitive quick, I wish it was more open/larger\n\n\nProbably my biggest issue with this game is the story itself, things start out simple enough doing simple tasks around the park, but by day 3 the game gears up and immediately picks up pace.\n\nNext moment it's day 9, the next it's day 33, then day 60 something the story's pacing picks up speed, gearing up for what seems could be very interesting story of who to trust and paranoia fueled fear of being alone in the woods, but the problem is the pacing doesn't slow down... The next thing you know it's... Over.\n\nBut not only that, the note it ends on for me personally fell flat and left me just wanting more.\nBut at the same time I understand the ending, I get the point it was making, as I mentioned earlier this game makes a topic and point of your emotions and expectations, but my issue is I wasn't invested to begin with in the paranoia of everything because of the break neck pacing...\n\nSo when it ends on the note it did... I just felt nothing, but I did have a few conversations with other people that did play this game and they liked the ending and thought it was very “humanizing” to quote them, so you may have a different opinion so don't let this keep you from making your own opinion and actually playing the game.\n\nMy next issue is the size of the environment itself, the map at first seems big and the game does a good job at making the scope of the game seem fairly large, but honestly once you play for a little bit you'll quickly realize the paths mostly branch together or go to the same area and are surprisingly linear.\n\nMy best advice to anyone playing this is to disable the marker for yourself on the map and actually force yourself to utilize the map and compass and learn your way around the park to at least keep things a tiny bit more challenging.\nBut now let's discuss...\n\n\n---The Opinion---\n\nAll in all I think Firewatch is a fantastic looking game, the story is intriguing enough; but I felt the pacing was a bit too fast and left me wanting more of the menial tasks from early on like dealing with rowdy campers and the dialogue that came along with it.\n\nBut other then that, the soundtrack, the quality voice acting and dialogue of the story still more than make up for it in my opinion.\n\nPersonally I clocked in a good 6 hours or so across two separate playthroughs so yes the game is pretty short and admittedly $20 USD is pretty steep for the amount of content this game will offer you; so I still recommend it, but wait for it to be on sale.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n","February 14","true","6.9"," 36 of 66 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","36","66","0","3"

It plays similarly to a TellTale game, allowing you to make "choices" and interact with the world. From the very beginning, the game does a great job of grabbing your attention and pulling you into the wilderness of Wyoming. Despite there being others doing the same job as you, there is only one person for you to communicate with, and the only way of doing that is through a walkie-talkie. The dialouge is quirky and cute, with multiple response options. It definitely makes this otherwise dull walking simulator interesting and fun.\n\nThe environment/graphics are gorgeous; I really enjoy the art style they went with. In order to find your way around, there are numerous signs directing you to different locations of the map, and how many miles away you are. You also have a physical map and compass that you use to find your way (no waypoints!), which I found to be a superb element for the game. You also have the option to turn on or off your player's marker on the map. The map itself was a little bigger than I expected, however it does give a false sense of "open world". Many areas are subtlely closed off until you reach certain checkpoints in the story, then they are "magically" cleared.\n\nThe story eventually takes a mysterious turn, daring you to search the Wyoming wilderness for answers. This bit of the game is fantastic and I wish it would have lasted longer, or even gave a satisfying ending. I left this game feeling unfulfilled, like many other reviews you'll see here. With Firewatch only being 3 - 4 hours long, it seems that they didn't know where or how to end it, or they ran out of time and simply rushed it.\n\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful environment\n- Immersive\n- Top notch voice acting\n- Interesting/humorous dialouge\n- Minimal backtracking\n\nCons:\n- Aburpt ending\n- Ending feels incomplete\n- Disappointingly short (3-4 hours)\n- False sense of "open world"\n\n\nDespite its faults, Firewatch is still a great experience and a must play. Because of that, I will give it a thumbs up. However, for what it is, I would not recommend buying it at full price.

Now I'm happier than before, because this stunningly beautiful piece of art is just brilliant. It has everything I like so much about games: touching story, unusual setting, beautiful graphics, calming gameplay and - it was a surprise for me - innovative controls (radio, looking at objects and of course the map). I feel like every piece of puzzle is created with love and patience. This is the place where you can just go and explore territory or watch animals in the woods. Or go doing tasks, that's also very interesting. I never thought Firewatch to become one of my favorite games ever so fast.

You spend a lot of time hiking, and climbing through the terrain to complete your objectives. You can explore different areas, and interact with different objects. With just your backpack and a few items, you are practically alone in nature, and the only other person you have to talk with is on the other end of a walkie-talkie. While talking on the walkie-talkie, you will have a finite time to reply, and sometimes have different choices in dialog selection. Different dialog selections prompt different responses, but none of which will impact the outcome of the game.\n\nThe story is a linear. The dialog and circumstances throughout the game are very realistic and believable. There are some mysteries in the story as well, and it added a nice touch on the game overall.\n\nPros:the controls are fully customizable, and the game has full controller support\nimmersive and beautiful graphics - nature is absolutely stunning, and everything feels so alive with the grass and trees moving and swaying in the wind\nbackground music, and ambience sounds of nature are really well done\nbelievable characters with dialog and voice acting that are incredible\nCons:the story is too short for the price tag\nthe ending was done well, but I have mixed feelings about how it ended (it was what I expected would happen, but not what I wanted to see happen)\nThe game took me just under 4 hours to complete. After I finished it, I went back and played it again to experience the different dialog choices, but other than hearing a few new lines here and there, there wasn’t any other reason to replay it.\n\nI really liked the game, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys an immersive experience with really great voice dialog. It was a wonderful game, but the price is too high for how short it is, so I would advise picking it up at a sale price.","March 28","true","7.4"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","16","28","0","0"

He fell into the cave you see early on in the game.\nThe part that doesn't make sense, is that the dad suddenly becomes a mountain man hermit dude because of this.\nI understand that he would have to explain his son not only being there (which isn't supposed to happen) but his son's death as well. But it makes no sense to start tricking you into thinking that there's a government conspiracy to track you (which is what the dad does to keep you from finding his son's body). What the hell would that solve for anyone? Why would it be advantageous to the dad for you to think you're being studied by someone? Shouldn't he (the father) have just broken into the cave (which he had the key to), taken the sons body out to bury somewhere else, and /then/ become the hermit freaky dude? Or alternatively just toss the key in the lake and not worry about anyone getting in there afterall.\nThe only reason the conspiracy thing exists in the game is for the developers to add fluff to a topic that has no substance.

The voice acting is excellent depending on how you proceed through the story is excellent (to a point).  Although there is little in the way of music, when music was present it set the tone quite well.\n\nFirewatch is as much about the story as its about a conversation between two people.  If this happened to be either cheaper or longer or both I could recommend it however, Firewatch is neither of these things!  I will say this it does (sort of) live up to the trailer videos the humour is the almost all the way through.  If you allow yourself to be drawn in by the story you will have a better experience.

Unfortunately, that only takes you about 3 hours, 4 if you're stopping to explore or enjoy the scenery. Near the end, the story, as many others have said, falls flat. It's a big build up for a dissapointing payoff. And you may say "but you can make choices and change the ending of the game!". I haven't tried it my self but aparently changing your choices only changes the dialouge and not the actually ending, pretty much eliminating any chance for re-playability (unless you want to hear EVERY line).

I would read a few spoiler free reviews and if this sounds intresting then wait for a Steam Sale.","February 10","false","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

(Glad the Steam Controller got it's own button layout.)\n- The atmosphere is great.\n\nCons:\n\n- Very short. Took me about 2-3 hours to beat the game, the rest was for cards.\n- Little to no character development.\n- The ending ruined the story for me.\n- Lots of backtracking, the map seems big, but is actually very small.\n- Decisions don't change much. The ending from what I've heard is the same no matter what choices you made.\n\nConclusion:\n\n6/10 - I can't recommend this game at $20. The start of the game showed promise, but in the end the story seemed rushed and the ending was pretty bad. I'd suggest waiting for the game to drop to $5 to $10 before even considering to purchase it.","February 10","false","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I won't say anything more about the story other than it is very well written and also very funny and charming with good character development. With a game thats basically all about story, thats really all you need for a recommendation. You'll know if this kind of game is for you or not\n\nTo those complaining about length, its a $20 exploration game. If you expected 15 hours out of this, you must not play this genre very often. You have to be okay with a few hour experience. I finished after 4.5 hours while doing moderate exploration and trying to get as much dialogue as I can. If you can't rationalize $20 for a game like this, by all means wait for a sale, but for a lot of people including me, its already worth the 20 price tag for getting basically a longer, better written movie.\n\nSome of the downsides, its a first person game without an FOV slider. Not sure why they left it out, but I did get a mild headache. Its possible it was because I played for almost 5 hours without stopping, but be wary. Also some people are experiencing performance issues and glitches. For me though, I only had a few minor graphical issues. Lasty, I'm not going to talk about the details, but some people have issues with the end of the game and its definitely hit or miss, either you might not like it. At first I wrote that I liked it in my initial review, but on recollection the ending is not great compared to the rest of the game. Definitely disappointed at the end.\n\nOverall, FIrewatch is a great Exploration/story based experience thats worth a playthrough. Don't spoil yourself! Its a story worth playing through on your own\n\nIf you don't have strict $1-1 hour preferences:\nBuy At Full Price\nIf you do:\nWait For A Sale","February 9","true","4.6"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","21","38","0","1"

Let's start with the pro's.  This game has beautiful artwork, smooth controls/gameplay, very immursive story.  The artwork reminds me a bit of a cross between "The Long Dark" (another great game :D) and borderlands.  The gameplay/controls are smooth.  I saw a couple visual glitches but overall great!  Lastly the story.  This game is not like anything I've ever played before.  I'm not a big walking simulator guy but this story was captivating.  As soon as I started playing I couldn't stop.\n\nThat brings us to the con's....it was a short game.  I beat the game with 3.4hrs.  I plan on playing through again but the story is very linear.  Your choices don't effect the outcome of the story, just the dialog along the way, which is pretty disappointing.  The game as a whole was amazing but I wish it was longer or they turned it into episodes like other story telling games out there.  I feel like Firewatch just left the player at the end thinking...."that's it?".

Steam says I put in about 3 hours and I completed it. I didn't explore or anything since I was invested in the story but just beware that it is a short game. If you're interested but the price is too high then I suggest waiting for a sale before picking it up. If you're unsure then you should just wait for a sale to pick it up.\n\nThe game is fantastic though. I got really invested in the characters and story which is why I ran through it so quickly. The voice acting felt realistic to me and while the writing may have been a bit flat or subpar side characters, the relationship between Delilah and Henry (your character) feels realistic and fluid. There's banter and humor and emotion in every line and it feels like real people just having a conversation rather than some people in a studio reading off a script. It's what elevates this game from mediocre to fantastic for me.\n\nThe graphics are really stylized and pretty. It's got a cartoonish feel to it that looks great and keeps the forest you're wandering in feel colorful and alive. The lighting plays an important role because there are many moments right at sunset where the sun is shining through the trees and it just feels and looks majestic.\n\nThe audio is a good mix of ambience and music. When you're wandering through the forest you'll find that the only sounds you hear are the sounds of your footsteps and the wind. It's very quiet and lonely. When something dramatic is happening the music quietly comes in and becomes a part of the scene, creating emotion and driving you forward. I highly recommend buying the soundtrack because it's extremely good.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, the ending feels hollow. Not in that it's a poorly written ending or anything like that. Rather it makes you feel hollow, like this journey you've been on is coming to a close and it's not exactly the ending you wanted. It's not happy, it's not sad, it just is an ending. It's fitting and while it's not the most satisfying, it's the most fitting.\n\nAfter all I've said praising this game there are some problems. Invisible walls and artificial barriers are prevalent throughout this game. Some of the barriers can only be cleared after you've progressed so far into the story, which is fine but still feels like the game is limiting your exploration abilities. By the time I could theoretically explore everywhere, I was far enough into the story that I didn't have the desire to explore anymore since I wanted to see how things ended. There were other small barriers that annoyed me. One example is a trail by the lake. I got lost and there's a literal wall of dirt and rocks that separates you from where you need to go. Instead of being able to climb over this mound (which was definitely possible mind you) I instead had to walk around it to end up on the other side. It's not major but it's annoying in a game that's about exploration.\n\nThere's also a lot of glitches and bugs in the game. Frequently I got caught on rocks and branches and things like that and had to back up and move around them like I was a car or something. I found a lot of seams in the world where they failed to properly connect them so I could see into the void below. I also saw a couple of rocks that had no bottoms. It's a lot of minor stuff like this.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game and plan to do another run through at some point to fully explore the environment. The presentation is spectacular and the main characters are realistic and engaging. The invisible walls and glitches take away from the overall experience but the glitches will be patched out.","February 9","true","3.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It has an interesting way of developing drama and the overall plot to create some strong tension. But the game is easily an hour too long and just drags on in parts. I wish I could request a refund for the three hours I put into the game but I can't, but on the flipside if the game had been much shorter I would've had a much greater experience.\n\nWays the game artificially expands the length:\n-Certain days end abruptly, while some others carry out much longer for seeming no reason\n-The controls are clunky and if you want to know where youre going and have the map out you cannot run at the same time\n-There are arbitrary restrictions on where you can and cannot run\n-The invisible walls dictate a finite amount of paths you may or may not take through levels\n\nAll in all the narrative is very interesting, but the length of the game makes me wish I had requested a refund. If the game was shorter I would've enjoyed it much more.\n\nEdit: It should be noted that every exciting moment of the video game is literally in the trailers.","February 9","false","3.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Basically a lot of walking back and forth, not a lot of exploring possible given the walled off paths you are railed onto. The art style and scenery is nice at first, but when you see the same stuff everywhere (read: all ledges, climbing spots, etc.) you start to lose interest in it.\n\nThe walkie talkie woman just tells you where to go, what to do. The 'meaningful' dialogue options don't really appear to have any impact on the overall story arc or on further dialogue, when the creators of the game tout the "building or destroying" of the "only meaningful relationship you have."

At time didnt understand the story of the game and dont really want to explain much but really of your characters wife having alzheimers after being with her for a few years and then you moving away to a new job that bascially stops forrest fires but also becomes strange within the process and talking to Delilah more or less all the time about life and why you came here and her life.\n\nBut when in game it is absolutely stunning and very well graphically made and love having to decide on what to say to  Delilah through the walkie-talkie and the choices to say to her. Love the way the game also uses the map, shows that you actually have to keep looking to find where you need to go and follow the correct route rather than fast traveling or making waypoints and following them.\n\nOnly thing I found dissappointing was the lengh of the game as a whole, i thought it would of been longer and liked how it planned out by day by day until it got to around the third or fourth day then started jumping greatly to Day 15 then Day 50 and so on until you relised he was there for that long and knowing that something will happen or it will keep going.\n\nAll and all though love the screenshots that i ahve captured from the game and i wouldnt say it was replayable again unless they brought out a second one to add on from what happened at the end.\n\noverall...\n\n7.5/10\n\n\n\n","February 9","true","3.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

If it succeeds in that, then it's certanly worth your money.","February 10","true","3.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","4"

Started it last night and finished it in about 5 hours. It's relatively shorter than most games in that aspect but it's only $20 so it's a pretty reasonable price for the content. At the same time it doesn't overstay its welcome with sidequests, things to collect, or achievements. You play as Henry, a fire watcher employed at a national park in Wyoming. You have little to no physical human interaction as you spend the entire game talking over a handheld radio to your fellow firewatcher, Delilah, who is stationed on the other side of the park. This, in my opinion, is one of the best things about the game because it allows the player to emotionally connect with the two main characters without knowing anything but the sound of their voices. It tells its story in a quirky, down-to-earth narrative that has dialogue options making you feeling like you ARE your character. Seriously, the dialogue in this game feels so natural and unscripted that it's like I'm talking to one of my friends. The graphics are pretty decent for games these days but what really stands out is the color schemes. The oranges, yellows, and reds of the Wyoming landscape beautifully contrast the azure sky giving it a nice, warm feeling as you hike throughout the park. The game has a linear story and although the park is pretty large there's a lot of hiking between areas that will quickly become familiar, which is cool because it makes you feel like you've worked there a while. Even so, backtracking is never wasted since the story continues as long as you are headed the right way so hopefully you have a good sense of direction. I won't spoil any of the plot but as you progress, you find out that you're being watched by something or someone and things go south from there. Overall, the game is beautifully crafted for one so short and its simple controls and linear story make it an enjoyable experience. The only gripes I have are the occasional bugs (game crashing, getting stuck on terrain, etc.) and the mildly disappointing ending (maybe I was just expecting more closure). For all it's worth though, I give this game an 8/10. Bravo, Campo Santo!\n\n\nEDIT:\nNow, I did say that this was MY review and it's based off of what I thought. I've noticed a lot of the other reviews and comments all talking about how the game is way too short and isn't worth $20 for its length. However, ME PERSONALLY, I didn't mind paying that much for an enjoyable experience. Would I pay a full normal-release price of $60 for something like this? Hell no. Would YOU pay $20 for this game?

Depends on how attached you get.\nI recommend to ONLY play this game if you're really into short story exploration games!\n\nThe dev's say the game takes 6h, it took me 4 with exploring almost everything. Put, I almost rushed it a bit towards the end because I had no free time.\nBut If I had another free day, I'd totally replay it. No questions. No regrets. Just, FireWatch.\n\nThe story is mostly what you will take it. Aside from the amazing looking terrain and the atmosphere that will change throughout the game. It adjusts itself to the story and it does so perfectly.\nHenry does so too. Or, you do. You are Henry and you're just on a trip away from the reality you used to know, from your old life.\nYou'll "meet" an amazing person and explore a huge terrain of wilderness and trees. Of course, there's a plot. Two, actually. Maybe even 3, if you count the first one.\nIn the first part of the game it kind of gives you a mystery/horror vibe, but that will settle down once you get on to the truth.\nTo be honest, I was creeped out almost throughout the whole game.\n\nPro:\n- Beautiful looking game\n- Incredible story with twists\n- The most realistic and living conversations ever in a videogame\n- Exploration in your own time\n- A lot to see and talk about\n- Mysteries\n- A break from reality\n\nCons:\n- You sometimes get stuck on rocks\n- Floating trees near teens camp\n- only 2 wildlife appearences\n\nThis game is for people, who enjoy taking their own break from reality and enjoy a story, so well written, you  almost think you're a part of it. It's honestly incredible.\nIf you're into exploration games with a deep story and incredibly real conversation, this is the game for you.\nI've been waiting on this game since E3 and I am not disappointed. A lot of people in the forums are, apparently, but I think they weren't quite sure what they signed up for. I didn't either, but I still enjoyed it.\n\n9.7/10\n\nWhere'd you go, Delilah?","February 10","true","3.6"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","0"

It's a readily recognizable concept; I'd wager that very few of us haven't felt the pang of true loneliness or social disconnect at least once in our lives, in any of their broadly varying and often soul-crushing forms.\n\nIt's a facet tapped into superbly by Campo Santo, who use the desolate, amber-waxed wild of the Wyoming countryside as a backdrop for their poignant reverie of disillusionment and human connection. So, of course, not complete isolation. As your proverbial lifeline, the disembodied but gregarious cadence of Delilah will greet you almost immediately, and the strikingly dynamic relationship that ensues should be the main draw card for any gamer with a taste for this budding strain of mature, melancholic storytelling.\n\nYou play as Henry. In the stark but finely-tuned opening 10 minutes, a series of text cards reveal that Henry's wife, Julia, has fallen victim to early onset alzheimers. After taking charge of her care for a number of years, Henry suddenly find himself alone and without responsibility when Julia's family steps in and request that Julia move back home to Australia with them. This brings Henry to where we meet him: Hiking to a lookout post to spend the accompanying summer surveying the surrounding Wyoming rainforest (dubbed 'Two Forks') for any potential fires or anomalies. A mundane job, maybe, if not for the perpetual presence of Delilah, your closest fellow lookout, filtered entirely through the 2-inch speaker of your CB radio. She's peppy, charming, sarcastic and utterly loveable. Over the course of the summer you'll develop a delicately grounded relationship with Delilah; refreshing is the lack of any pretentious understatement or gauche melodrama. These are two intelligent, mature-aged adults who interact and react accordingly, who's desires and motivations are clear, authentic and beautifully realised. Your conversations with 'D' segue seamlessly from light-hearted jives, to existential ponderings, from the quietly romantic, to the devastatingly candid, and everything in between.\n\nUnfortunately it's juxtaposed with a slightly awkward murder-mystery sub-plot involving a father and son who disappeared hiking the surrounding area many years prior. It's engaging enough and, once fully revealed, not without poignancy. But it's staying power pales in comparison to any one of the most intimate moments you share with Delilah. For that, it feels like a somewhat convoluted artifice added for the purpose of propelling the core narrative but without actually enhancing it. I can understand Campo Santo's reticence to rely wholly on the wistful ruminations of two forty-somethings to hold our attention, but I honestly think it would have served Firewatch for the better.\n\nHindering subplots aside, the only other reservations I have about the game are ultimately trivial. I experienced a few occasional texture pop-in moments, but hardly enough to break immersion. One too many invisible walls make traversing the map far more frustrating then it needs to be and the faint, poorly illustrated map doesn't really help matters.  Also, Henry's character design is comically crude; his body resembles that of an ill-proportioned, morbidly obese toddler. It's slightly bizzare.\n\nAny graphical shortcomings inflicted on your avatar is more than made up for by the radiant artistry of your surrounding environment. The Wyoming wilderness is filtered through a rich mosaic of reds, golds, greens and ambers; a brazen color wheel that veers dangersouly close to 'overdone' but thankfully never crosses that line. Trees, ravines, rivers, ponds, mountains, bluffs, and open fields pockmark every corner of the map and they're all stunningly crafted. But most importantly, they're cohesive. Two Forks feels like a natural, dynamic location; nothing seems over-designed or out of place. It's a truly hypnotising landscape to traipse through and it's ambience is only bolstered by the audio design, a simple but polished medley of melodic breezes, rustling leaves and Chris Remo's superlative, Gustavo Santaolalla-inspired soundtrack. Beautiful.\n\nBut for all the technical flare, it's Henry and Delilah that stand above all else. The passion and unadulterated empathy Campo Santo has managed to conjure for these characters is no small feat in any medium. You feel for these two and their quiet, common struggles; a compassion develops so thick it's almost tangible. There's a solemn yearning at the heart of their relationship; a primal hunger for any vestige of feasible human intimacy that simultaneously guide and haunt them through the summer. It's wonderfully soulful stuff, and it all leads to an ending as wistful and restrained as the game that preceded it. Some feel short-changed for Firewatch not having delivered a more definitive conclusion, especially in the wake of a game that can be finished in 3 hours. "Too short and no resolution" they say. I know of someone who might shrug off such criticisms - "That's life, Buckaroo...".\n\nːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriːːichi_bluetriːːichi_redtriː","March 26","true","4.8"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","1"

Once I heard that the head devs for two of my favorite games, Walking Dead Season 1 and Mark of the Ninja, had founded their own studio I knew I had to play their first game. Firewatch didn’t disappoint me at all.\n\nFirewatch is a narrative driven adventure game that has you play as Henry, a man working in a national park looking out for forest fires, seemingly trying to get away from his normal life. His only real contact to anyone else is his superior, Delilah, who’s stationed in another outpost miles away. The game focuses on how you develop your relationship with them, as well what kind of guy Henry is. There’s also some good amounts of exploration as well. The dialogue is fantastic and reactive, and you will probably make a habit of calling in everything to Delilah just so you can have more of their interactions. It's overall a fantastic character piece video game and the first ten minutes alone illustrate this from the get-go.\n\nWhile the plot is set in stone, their relationship and who Henry is is not. The plot is also engaging and has an air of real mystery to it. The ending is ultimately quite satisfying and bittersweet, practically all loose ends are tied up and it can end on a melancholy yet hopeful note. It also has really good pacing, people may whine that its short, but some gamers just don’t seem to appreciate tightly-paced games. (And really its not that short, it took me almost five hours to complete it, also give me quality over quantity any day.)\n\nAlso the game is gorgeous and walking around the forest is great. The soundtracks is also really good too and adds to the atmosphere.\n\nOverall Firewatch is a great adventure game and while I’m still mulling it over if it’s one of my favorite games of all time, its most definitely going to be one of my GOTY.","February 9","true","4.9"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

It was shallow and with caricatures as characters, and had badly designed area maps. The graphics are pretty and the voice acting is nice.\n\nLonger review:\nI didn't mind that it was short, I didn't mind that it looked like a sandbox but the map was on rails, I didn't mind that it was a story told through voice acting and props. I didn't mind that Henry and Delilah don't ever meet face to face.\n\nThis game's fan base seems to almost entirely revolve around people who think the voice actress is sexy. She has a great voice, but that's not enough to make up for a mediocre story and a terrible ending.\n\nThe main characters Delilah and Henry are not broken people with a strong interesting story. They're broken people with a maybe interesting story that implodes in on itself when you reach the end. There's no growth or character arc. They learn nothing from their experiences. They're the same toxic and self-absorbed people at the end of the story that they were when they started.\n\nThe dev team defends this as being realistic. That might have worked better if about 80% of the story wasn't focused on a ridiculously unrealistic conspiracy that seems like it was pulled from an old episode of the X-Files. Or if they'd included a relationship that was build on some sort of respect or affection rather than lust and appeasement.\n\nThere are a number of interesting and thought-provoking ideas brought up in the prologue. Adults making selfish choices, alcoholism, early-onset dementia, partners enabling bad behavior in each other. Then they're all dropped in favor of a Scooby Doo mystery. And when you pull the mask off Old Man Smithers you get a thinly veiled lecture from devs on how Escapism is Bad Kids, M'kay?\n\nSo there's no story scripting to pursue the interesting adult topics, and the only story is to particpate in a Bad Escapist Mystery that teaches us Escapism is bad. How about instead the devs provide a game that looks at the interesting adult topics they promised during the publicity tour and prologue?\n\nNone of the decisions you make in the dialogues matter to the story. There isn't even the illusion of choice. According to their own statements, the dev team wanted to provide an environment where they told a strict linear story with no player agency and almost no game-play elements. It would have been better served as a machinima movie. The driving force behind playing games is to have some sort of active involvement in game progression. If we wanted a purely passive audio-visual experience we'd choose a different medium.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, it took me 8 tries to finish the game. I got stuck in invisible walls 7 times, in 7 completely different locations. I can't tell you how I did it (I didn't *try* to get stuck). I also spent almost all my time lost. The terrain was poorly designed (I kept following side paths that went nowhere) and inconsistent. In some cases, I could jump across wide gaps but couldn't step across narrow ones. In other cases environmental barricades (trees/bushes/rocks/fallen trees) were passable and other times they weren't.\n\nThe map was not aligned in all places to the paths. Sometimes I needed to be "on" the red line of the path, other times I had to be to the left or right of it. Time of day was calibrated to reaching certain story points, so it was hard to use the sun to track direction. Holding up the map and compass blocked the interaction symbol for most items, so I used them as little as possible. With a bad sun, bad map, bad compass, and bad environmental barricades, I spent most of my play time wandering in pointless circles (or restarting after getting stuck, and playing the same conversations again and again).\n\nThis was just a bad game. I'm sorry to put it in those terms, I'm sure the development team worked hard on it, but it was not worth the money I paid for it nor the time I put into playing it.","February 10","false","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Everything from the visuals, the story, the dialogue, the soundtrack (oh my god the soundtrack), was beyond everything I had hoped. This game exceeded my expectations in just about every area, and that's saying something seeing as I usually find exploration games dreadfully boring.\n\nHowever, Firewatch brought more to it than explanation. Instead of just aimless wandering with the hope of finding clues, you're given a narrative. And a fantastic one. Delilah guides Henry throughout the wilderness in an attempt to find out just what exactly is going on (im not spoiling anything). Through this you find tools, locations, loot, and notes which further expand upon the backgrounds of certain characters and the overall story.\n\nDelilah also served as more than just a boss for Henry. Throughout the game you see and hear their relationship strengthen immensely, and at times I was angry at Henry for being married because I wanted them to be a couple so bad.\n\nApart from the story itself, one of the best things about this game was the soundtrack. With beautiful nature visuals must come a beautiful and emotional soundtrack, and that's exactly what this game did. The exploration of the woods accompanied with soothing piano, acoustic guitar, or the beat of drums (in more intense moments) did wonders to add to the mood of the overall game.\n\nThe only negatives are, as many reviewers have stated, the short length (3-4 hours), and the fact that this does not feel like a "complete game".

While the plot's climax may subtly relate to the game's stellar (and deeply sad) intro, it can't support the weight of the events leading up to it.\n\nFirewatch is beautiful, the art style is striking, the voice acting is superb. A few rough edges are present, but forgivable. It can be completed in four hours or so. There are no challenges or traditional gameplay to speak of: your choices are entirely narrative in nature. Time advances as dictated by the story. Exploration is rarely rewarded.\n\nSadly, through no fault of its own, the game's narrative is shackled by the near-total absence of animated human beings. Being a small studio, it seems Campo Santo determined that they didn't have the budget for animated people, and designed Firewatch around this restriction. While their attempt should be lauded, the character-centric story they are telling ultimately suffers from it.\n\nI'd recommend this to people that like narrativist gaming or are craving a survival-free first-person adventure game experience... but I'm still mad about the ending, so this gets a red thumb from me.","February 9","false","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was shallow and with caricatures as characters, and had badly designed area maps. The graphics are pretty and the voice acting is nice.\n\nLonger review:\nI didn't mind that it was short, I didn't mind that it looked like a sandbox but the map was on rails, I didn't mind that it was a story told through voice acting and props. I didn't mind that Henry and Delilah don't ever meet face to face.\n\nThis game's fan base seems to almost entirely revolve around people who think the voice actress is sexy. She has a great voice, but that's not enough to make up for a mediocre story and a terrible ending.\n\nThe main characters Delilah and Henry are not broken people with a strong interesting story. They're broken people with a maybe interesting story that implodes in on itself when you reach the end. There's no growth or character arc. They learn nothing from their experiences. They're the same toxic and self-absorbed people at the end of the story that they were when they started.\n\nThe dev team defends this as being realistic. That might have worked better if about 80% of the story wasn't focused on a ridiculously unrealistic conspiracy that seems like it was pulled from an old episode of the X-Files. Or if they'd included a relationship that was build on some sort of respect or affection rather than lust and appeasement.\n\nThere are a number of interesting and thought-provoking ideas brought up in the prologue. Adults making selfish choices, alcoholism, early-onset dementia, partners enabling bad behavior in each other. Then they're all dropped in favor of a Scooby Doo mystery. And when you pull the mask off Old Man Smithers you get a thinly veiled lecture from devs on how Escapism is Bad Kids, M'kay?\n\nSo there's no story scripting to pursue the interesting adult topics, and the only story is to particpate in a Bad Escapist Mystery that teaches us Escapism is bad. How about instead the devs provide a game that looks at the interesting adult topics they promised during the publicity tour and prologue?\n\nNone of the decisions you make in the dialogues matter to the story. There isn't even the illusion of choice. According to their own statements, the dev team wanted to provide an environment where they told a strict linear story with no player agency and almost no game-play elements. It would have been better served as a machinima movie. The driving force behind playing games is to have some sort of active involvement in game progression. If we wanted a purely passive audio-visual experience we'd choose a different medium.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, it took me 8 tries to finish the game. I got stuck in invisible walls 7 times, in 7 completely different locations. I can't tell you how I did it (I didn't *try* to get stuck). I also spent almost all my time lost. The terrain was poorly designed (I kept following side paths that went nowhere) and inconsistent. In some cases, I could jump across wide gaps but couldn't step across narrow ones. In other cases environmental barricades (trees/bushes/rocks/fallen trees) were passable and other times they weren't.\n\nThe map was not aligned in all places to the paths. Sometimes I needed to be "on" the red line of the path, other times I had to be to the left or right of it. Time of day was calibrated to reaching certain story points, so it was hard to use the sun to track direction. Holding up the map and compass blocked the interaction symbol for most items, so I used them as little as possible. With a bad sun, bad map, bad compass, and bad environmental barricades, I spent most of my play time wandering in pointless circles (or restarting after getting stuck, and playing the same conversations again and again).\n\nThis was just a bad game. I'm sorry to put it in those terms, I'm sure the development team worked hard on it, but it was not worth the money I paid for it nor the time I put into playing it.","February 10","false","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay consists of doing minor tasks that a park ranger would do, such as collecting beer cans or puting out fires. The game is a refreshment to the newest titles being released and a great experience. For only 17 dollars (At the moment) i conclude that it was definetely worth my time and money with a mere 3.5 hours of gameplay that i racked up.

I just love the idea of atmospheric games with beautiful scenery and dialog, it’s basically what I long for in every game I play. The game delivered exactly what I wanted from it flawlessly and it was one of the most enjoyable experiences I have had in some time until about two hours into the gameplay when everything started to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I was on my way to an objective and on the way there I noticed part of the world was not loaded, I restarted my game and still had the same situation. Having no other option I decided to chance my luck and walk into the invisible area and to my surprise everything loaded and looked fine! Excited to progress I began to run and noticed that I was going nowhere as I had been glitched inside a rock. As you can probably imagine I could not escape the rock and there was literally nothing I could do thus I began searching YouTube for a solution after a while of scrolling I found a video! But unfortunately it spoiled the entire plot of the game in the title. In a nutshell I am extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and have to start the the entire game again just to get to where I was last.

While the plot's climax may subtly relate to the game's stellar (and deeply sad) intro, it can't support the weight of the events leading up to it.\n\nFirewatch is beautiful, the art style is striking, the voice acting is superb. A few rough edges are present, but forgivable. It can be completed in four hours or so. There are no challenges or traditional gameplay to speak of: your choices are entirely narrative in nature. Time advances as dictated by the story. Exploration is rarely rewarded.\n\nSadly, through no fault of its own, the game's narrative is shackled by the near-total absence of animated human beings. Being a small studio, it seems Campo Santo determined that they didn't have the budget for animated people, and designed Firewatch around this restriction. While their attempt should be lauded, the character-centric story they are telling ultimately suffers from it.\n\nI'd recommend this to people that like narrativist gaming or are craving a survival-free first-person adventure game experience... but I'm still mad about the ending, so this gets a red thumb from me.","February 9","false","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is a great setup, tremendous innuendo that hints at a great mystery, and a world that quickly sucks you into the story. The problem is that the game cannot sustain this for the final act. And the grand reveal is - unfortunatly - underwhelming.\n\nThe game spends a long time setting up conflicts that are never actually explored. And at the end, i was quite convinced that  i hadn`t seen the "true" ending, because all of the conflict and mystery i was invested in was tossed aside.\n\nI wont spoil the story. When I read reviews that complain about story i often find that super subjective. If anything, i take statements like these as challenges to see the story myself. And if you are a skeptic like me and do play it, i think you will agree the setup is amazing. You wanna see the end of the mystery, There are these weird unexplained events, and the things you say trap you in the unwraveling mystery. But i warn you, the ending does not do the story justice. There are plot holes everywhere at the end.\n\nAnd its such a shame! The VO work is great, and the walkie talkie mechanic really grounds the characters. There are tons of little treats to be examined everywhere you look, and its such a pleasure that they feed into the mystery and suspense of Firewatch. The world is beautiful, and the exploring mechanics - especially early on - fire off all of the good brain chemicals.\n\nBut i cannot stress this enough: the ending takes all of the goodwill the game builds up for three hours and betrays it. It doesn`t accomplish it by making the characters do something without choice (a la Mass Effect 3 forcing you into a set of choices) or by an ending that disregards the players choices (a la bioshock infinite). Its not a cliche or even a nonsensical twist.\n\nThe ending is just deeply dissapointing.\n\nPlay it yourself and see. If there turns out to be a true ending, i would be totally willing to reconsider. But for now, its a character study that portrays itself as a mystery. The ending is not bad in a subjective way, i think. Its bad in how it sets up the characters and our relationship with them in a way that is deliberatly manipulative.\n\n------------\ntl;dr\nGreat Setup, Great Characters, Great VO work.

Mind you, I didn't really have a long period of anticipation building up to this game, I only noticed its existence a short while back. The graphical style and the narrative really grabbed my attention. It looked like a game to get lost in, which is something I quite enjoy.\n\nI decided to splurge on it and buy it right at launch for the "reduced" price of €18. Now right away, that's where the problem lies. This is simply too much for a game which only took me 3.6 hours to finish. Some quick math tells us that's 5 euro's per hour! I've never paid this much for a game in my life. But that's my fault for buying this game in good faith.\n\nTo you, who haven't yet purchased this, I would like to say wait until it goes on sale. I think realistically this game's price point should be somewhere closer to 8 or 10 euro's. But even if it were this cheap, there is still the issue of the story feeling unfinished. Plus some minor graphical glitches, consisting of pop-in and some meshes intersecting in ways they weren't supposed to.

I finished the game merely moments ago.\n\nThe overall look of everything is great , the art style is amazing. This game is beautiful.\nThe gameplay feels very good and overall well done without any errors.\n\nIt starts off differently then you would expect. You get immediatly hit by feels. If you were looking for a simple hiking game where you explore a forest... and an adventure game with an underlying story this is for you. The story itself is fantastically written and really makes you think about life at some points , what to trust... what to believe.\n\nOverall i highly recommend this game to anyone who likes an adventure + story game. If you wanted to strictly explore that would not always be possible considering some parts of the map are closed off until you further the story but usually I didnt find this a problem.\n\nAt the end all i would want to know is what happens to the main protagonist and wonder does he come to face his problem or to avoid it.\n\n\n","February 9","true","7.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The characters are likeable and relateable, the plot grips you tight as a vise for about 3-4 hours and then releases you into reality.\n\nIf you want a game for plot and characters moreso than for just action, by all means buy this game, but if not, it's probably best to avoid it.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nControls are easy to get used to. This game doesn't have much in way of gameplay, otherwise, and at times it may feel a bit tedious. There is quite a bit of getting lost and having to backtrack (probably one of my biggest gripe with this game, it's never fun to backtrack)\n\nGRAPHICS and AUDIO\n\n\n\nThis game looks and sounds amazing:\nGraphically speaking it's simillar to that of Borderlands as in it is not traditionaly beautiful (i.e realistic visuals) that being said it is still an incredibly beautiful looking game, the art style is amazing and it really does help to immerse you even further. Lighting effects are stunning. And beyond that the audio really helps to immerse you as well, the soundtrack is great, and the sounds of the forest are realistic and only adds to the atmosphere\n\nIN SUMMARY\n\n\nThis game is beautiful and immersive, the plot and characters are all very well writen. Gameplay wise it's lacking, and at times tedious.\nWhat I'll say, in summary, is buy this game if you love narrative driven games or gorgeous visuals (even if at times gameplay may be a bit tedious).

I bring this up because it's literally the ONLY interactive activity outside exploring and following the plot of the game... and it was a complete waste of time.\n\n5/10 - I'm half expecting the other half of this game to be released as DLC. It's actually a very beautiful game otherwise. It could have been one of the greats.","February 10","false","11.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, there are a ton of things wrong with this game. The choices you make have zero effect on the outcome. The whole game can be completed in about 3 hours, which is frustrating since you can't get a refund after 2 hours. Even knowing that, I still asked the Valve store for a refund and as expected, it was denied. This game has ZERO replay value since the story wont change and there's nothing else to do in the game world besides the main story. The ending is terrible, and again, you can't affect it. Let me save you the time and money. THE KID IS DEAD IN A CAVE AND THE FATHER COVERED IT UP. THE FATHER (NED) IS THE ONE STALKING YOU. YOU WONT GET DELILAH IN THE END SO DONT GET YOUR HOPES UP. There.

The style is very cool, the conversations with Delilah are great, and the prologue made me more than slightly emotional.

I am perfectly fine with a short game/experience if the story could live up to the expectations set up in that regard, but Firewatch falls flat in that department. I don't want to say that the story was rushed, but it certainly seemed that way when there is a heavy focus on certain events which took place early on in the game that never really had a satisfying payoff - in fact the entire sequence with the two girls shown in the promotional material is just an afterthought in terms of the story, and the conclusion to the mystery went from large-scale conspiracy to small-scale petty vengeance in the blink of an eye. There is an entire game mechanic (taking pictures) that is stressed to be important when documenting the mysterious goings-on in the forest, but that's essentially tossed out the window when any and all pictures you took did not matter in the slightest nor were ever brought up outside of the obligatory mention of the fact. On the topic of things in Firewatch that at first seemed important but later turned out not to matter at all, there was a sequence in the game where the main character hallucinated that the person on the other end of the walkie-talkie was his wife, and a brief reference later it was never brought up (or happened) again - I would chalk that up to wasted potential in terms of where the main character's personal story went. It reminds me of Gone Home in this regard, which suffers from similar issues that I am unable to justify paying the same price for. Unfortunately, as I am over the two hour limit and have completed the game, I am unable to request a refund. If this were the beginning of the story - because there is clearly more to be told regarding both characters and their respective histories - I would give this a better review and the benefit of the doubt. As this is not the case, I would not recommend the game at the price it is being asked for currently ($20). Sure, the conversations between the main character and his "sole lifeline" are somewhat entertaining, but they never really go anywhere special/different in the long run - and that's what disappointed me the most, as I was initially sold on the game concept because of the personal relationship between two characters from the initial promotional material.","February 10","false","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is not really an open world game. Yes, you have access to most of the map at all times, but the objectives are linear and mostly punctuated by taking you back to the tower once you complete them. The world is pretty, but there isn't anything in it. Aside from a few lockboxes you find and objects specifically related to your current objectives, there's nothing you can interact with in the world or see besides trees and ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThis game is also not a choice-based story in the vein of Life Is Strange. While you do have dialogue choices, they will not impact any in-game events or the game's ending in any meaningful way. It only affects the dialogue you hear back from your dispatcher.\n\nThis game does not have challenges in its gameplay. There are no puzzles, no combat, no way to "die" or fail your objectives. You are simply going through a story in first person.\n\nWhile none of these things are by any means requirements for a game to be good, it leaves us only with the story, which unfortunately isn't as good as I had hoped. The idea of the game is that you're alone, and because of your past you're emotionally unstable and susceptible to paranoia, and weird ♥♥♥♥ starts happening that you have to figure out. The game does an amazing job with the setup, and an amazing job of making everything feel creepier and creepier. But the big discovery about what's happening is super disappointing and anticlimactic (though I'll give that it's interesting and unexpected). I think they had a great opportunity to take it a step further and they didn't. And then everything that happens between that and the ending is really dull and unsatisfying.","February 10","false","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I finished the game in just over 3 hours on my first playthrough with basic navigation and finding pretty much everything there was to find. Overall, the game felt like a cartoon movie based around adult themes. However, it doesn't cost me $20 to go to the movies, so I see no reason why a game that lasts just a bit longer than a movie should cost more than $10. If you don't care about spending $20 on a movie, then by all means go for it.

While the plot's climax may subtly relate to the game's stellar (and deeply sad) intro, it can't support the weight of the events leading up to it.\n\nFirewatch is beautiful, the art style is striking, the voice acting is superb. A few rough edges are present, but forgivable. It can be completed in four hours or so. There are no challenges or traditional gameplay to speak of: your choices are entirely narrative in nature. Time advances as dictated by the story. Exploration is rarely rewarded.\n\nSadly, through no fault of its own, the game's narrative is shackled by the near-total absence of animated human beings. Being a small studio, it seems Campo Santo determined that they didn't have the budget for animated people, and designed Firewatch around this restriction. While their attempt should be lauded, the character-centric story they are telling ultimately suffers from it.\n\nI'd recommend this to people that like narrativist gaming or are craving a survival-free first-person adventure game experience... but I'm still mad about the ending, so this gets a red thumb from me.","February 9","false","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The interaction with the ever clever and mysterious woman over the radio is the best done part of the game and deserves an award. But as the story continues it soon begins to feel rushed and the ending appears so quickly that you think they must have left part of the game out. The settings is done well but they could have surely done better if they converted it over to an open world exploration game with less restricted paths. In addition the developers fails by not allowing different ending depending on the choices that one has made. It would have changed the overall approach to the story significantly. In conclusion I credit the developers with taking a risk as the game touches an artistic point that is not felt in another games I have played, this is a great mystery game to purchase under $10, as the game currently sits  it is easily completed under 6 hours and the replay value is very small.\n\n***The negative review is purely related to the price of the game at launch and I would recommend it for $10 and under***\n","February 9","false","7.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The relationships and characters this game supplies are believable and genuine, the emotions and suspense truly grip your heart. The ending may not be as big a twist as you may have been hoping for, but it seems natural, a logical consequence of everything that's happened, not contrived in the least. The music makes an amazing and fitting counterpiece to the happenings of the park.\n\nI have noticed some minor gameplay glitches and some few graphic artifacts, but apart from that my only real complaint would be the short game time. If you explore absolutely everything, you're looking at 6 hours at the most, and that's if you're going at a very sluggish pace (not that that's a bad thing; quite the opposite really), more likely 4-5. Still, the "realness" of the heartfelt dialogue more than make up for it in my opinion.\n\nBe aware, though, that this game focuses on character and its development most of all.

These kinds of games take you on a rollercoaster of emotions, thoughts and imagination.\nIt begins with a little story to set your character up and we continue with your story set in a beautiful forest. The only companion you have, is your radio, where Delilah is on the other side. Is she friend or foe? Is this forest really what it seems?\nTake a chance on this one. It's not action packed, no big explosions or car chases. There is no hot lady or cute dog next to you. No!

It totally enchanted me into its comforting scenery, solitude and deliberate simplicity.\n\nThe story and the characters felt believable to me - they were mature, 30-45 years old, and also acted like it. That's still pretty uncommon in videogames, and it felt very refreshing. Guns and saving the world is all nice, but I feel like there are so many unexplored possibilities for video game narratives and Firewatch is enforcing that feeling.\n\nThe dialogue, script, voice acting are all superb, it's obvious a lot of time went into fine tuning that part of the game, which is really a central mechanic. Its amazing how the game accomplished to enchant with its fairly simple mechanics. The moods in the art are wonderful, too, if not necessarily the most polished part of the game.\n\nI feel like the game is a step forward from the telltale games - not a huge step - but definitely a step forward in the art of interactive digital storytelling. Its so exciting to see the media evolve, and I can't wait to see what they cook up next!","February 18","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

None that I can see majorly changing the storyline. The story starts off strong and gets incredibly intense around halfway through, you're on edge pretty much everywhere you go. After that it just seems to dwindle, things start to become predictable. To my surprise, the storyline and gameplay time is very short. Only around 4/5 hours long, would of liked to seen it streched longer. The ending was anticlimactic, again slightly predictable, could have spiced things up a bit as it started to get boring and tedious.\n\n£14.99? It's a bit steep, but for a game I've been following in development for nearly 2 years. I had to buy it. If thinking of buying I would recommend buying it when it comes on sale. If you're not into the art side of games, I would avoid this, it doesn't have any replay value.\n\nThe one thing to keep in mind when buying this is remembering it's a piece of art, it's highly unique to any other game I've played. It's just based of 2 characters with no motos or hero like aspects. You can just spent time walking around and listening to the soundtrack, which I would of liked more of aswell. Sometimes you'd be walking across the map and only a 1 minute track would come on. Also, great sountrack for the game.\n\nI want to say that I loved this game, it's pretty, started off great. But it just fell short.\n\nI like it. 7/10","February 13","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The conversations are fun to listen to, but there are too little when just walking around and too many when doing things. Needed to be more balanced.\n\nThe developer also promised something like 6-8 hours of gameplay. I got lost almost every single turn, I went to the other side of the map multiple times and I finished it in 3 hours exactly. I listened to all the dialouge, always answered the radio etc. No possible way you could get 6 hours out of it, and it's not like this game has any replay value.\n\nOnly buy when on sale, worth $10 not $20.","February 10","false","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has a fantastic atmosphere and a beautiful world matches with some of the most natural voice acting I have heard in a video game, the connection between the characters is very dynamic and believable and is a one of the strongest points of this game.\n\nThe problem lays dorment with the story (no spoilers) they try to set up a gripping mystery and at the start this slowly unfolds and is very much the case, the problem becomes apparent as you progress a little more and the story gets more and more interesting then suddenly it's over. The climax of the game feels extremely hollow and really leaves you disappointed because in all honest I wanted more. It feels as just when things are starting to get real interesting the story cuts off and so much more could have been done with the plot they set up.\n\nI see a lot of people complaining about the games length and I personally don't see this as an issue, I will replay the game to look around a bit more and to try earn the achievements that decided not to pop but all in all this is a good game with a disappointing ending.","February 10","false","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Wait for it to become a 5 dollar game.\n\nThis game has very nice stylistic visuals; the story is somewhat interesting and the atmosphere keeps you playing but does not pay off at the end.\nWhile the art is pretty the world is kind of empty, don’t expect to see other people except in the distance, wildlife is almost non-existent, this game only has the bare minimum amount of art needed to tell the story which is kind of a let-down and comes off as lazy.\n\nThe gameplay consists of you talking on your walkie talkie with a fellow ranger (which is the high point of the game), walking from point A to point B and inspecting things when you get there, there is nothing more to it which wouldn’t be so bad if the story was much more compelling.\nThis is not a survival game nor a real exploration game, it’s an on rails game with the illusion of freedom so please keep that in mind when you purchase it.\n\nThe biggest gripe that me and I’m sure most people would have is that the game is very very short, I took my time, looked at everything I could in the locations I visited, spent time to talk about everything I saw through my walkie talkie and I still completed the game in 3 hours and after a second playthrough completed it in about 1 hour which is much too short for a 20 dollar price tag.\n\nThis is not a terrible game so I can’t say you won’t like it but keep this in mind before you buy; its runs nice, looks nice, has good voice acting and is interesting to play till the end but it’s also a very flawed game that feels rushed, lazy in its execution and content, it’s far too short and way over priced for what you get, if you are ok with all this then this is the game for you.","February 10","false","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm a forest firefighter, and seeing a game in this setting was unusual, and really got me interested. I watched every gameplay video and trailer that came out, which got me insanely hyped for it. I even preordered it, which served as a healthy reminder for me to go back to my personal policy of not preordering games.\n\nI'm pretty disappointed, to be honest.\n\nThe trailers gave the impression of a creepy thriller set in the wilderness, and probably the first hour and a half (if that) lived up to that hype. I was on the edge of my seat, blood pumping, jumping at loud noises. The plot had grabbed me, it was creepy and interesting, I was suspicious of everyone, even Henry himself.\n\nAnd then it just fell apart. It's like they were writing the plot outline on a friday arvo, thought "♥♥♥♥ it, let's wrap it up so we can head to the pub for beers," and hastily wrapped it up into a very tidy package. No mystery, no puzzles, nothing to solve. Once it started to wrap up, i lost interest. I wasn't scared, I wasn't curious. I finished it in like two and a half hours, and that's reading every document, taking it slowly.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's got good points. The design and aesthetic is awesome, great setting. very basic gameplay, but that's not a bad thing in every case. in this game though, it feels like a tool so you can wander through the bush and collect items.\nYou can adopt a tortoise. Dialog is witty, well written and well voiced. Too bad it seemed like the options had no impact on the outcome of the game, which honestly in hindsight makes the dialogue seem so useless.\n\nI wish I was defending this game, because i waited so long for this to come out. If the plot was deeper, or choices had impact on the outcome of the game, or the game was longer, then maybe I would be recommending it. But for 20 USD (more in AUD), I can't. that's like 10 dollars an hour! If it was 10 bucks or less, maybe I'd recommend it. Wait for a sale or something if you want to play it.\n\ntl;dr:  buy when cheaper\ncons: Shallow gameplay, short unfulfilling plot, choices have no impact on outcome of game, too expensive, conclusion was weak and disappointing.\npros: witty clever dialogue, great setting, nice aesthetic, you can adopt a turtle, first hour and a half is gripping and thrilling\nbuy when cheaper\n\nI'm so sad now...","February 10","false","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was really close to give this game a positive/recommending review.Because for people wanting an intriguing story that has mystery to it with some pretty visuals and a good soundtrack for what it is. I would recommened it. But It's too dam short. 3.1 hours as my steam says, played in one playthrough. Also the ending did annoy me, no dam satisfaction for me at the least. I would say that this game would be better if it were longer with more than one mystery to it. It didn't take the full potential of the wilderness and maybe murder/slasher/dissaperances mysteries and only presents you with one story which for a 'walking simulator' like this isn't very good. Now don't get me wrong, the characters are real, interesting and if you put your heart to it lovable. But, even though of the characters back story, I didn't feel attached.\n\nThe soundtrack is great and can be bought seperately (that's a + in my head as I collect video game soundtracks), the visuals are simple but appealing (if an ENB ever comes out for this game I'm 100% playing it again) but the narrative fell short in not exploting the mysteries of the wilderness and previous Firewatcher[s].

There is a great setup, tremendous innuendo that hints at a great mystery, and a world that quickly sucks you into the story. The problem is that the game cannot sustain this for the final act. And the grand reveal is - unfortunatly - underwhelming.\n\nThe game spends a long time setting up conflicts that are never actually explored. And at the end, i was quite convinced that  i hadn`t seen the "true" ending, because all of the conflict and mystery i was invested in was tossed aside.\n\nI wont spoil the story. When I read reviews that complain about story i often find that super subjective. If anything, i take statements like these as challenges to see the story myself. And if you are a skeptic like me and do play it, i think you will agree the setup is amazing. You wanna see the end of the mystery, There are these weird unexplained events, and the things you say trap you in the unwraveling mystery. But i warn you, the ending does not do the story justice. There are plot holes everywhere at the end.\n\nAnd its such a shame! The VO work is great, and the walkie talkie mechanic really grounds the characters. There are tons of little treats to be examined everywhere you look, and its such a pleasure that they feed into the mystery and suspense of Firewatch. The world is beautiful, and the exploring mechanics - especially early on - fire off all of the good brain chemicals.\n\nBut i cannot stress this enough: the ending takes all of the goodwill the game builds up for three hours and betrays it. It doesn`t accomplish it by making the characters do something without choice (a la Mass Effect 3 forcing you into a set of choices) or by an ending that disregards the players choices (a la bioshock infinite). Its not a cliche or even a nonsensical twist.\n\nThe ending is just deeply dissapointing.\n\nPlay it yourself and see. If there turns out to be a true ending, i would be totally willing to reconsider. But for now, its a character study that portrays itself as a mystery. The ending is not bad in a subjective way, i think. Its bad in how it sets up the characters and our relationship with them in a way that is deliberatly manipulative.\n\n------------\ntl;dr\nGreat Setup, Great Characters, Great VO work.

Plus some minor graphical glitches, consisting of pop-in and some meshes intersecting in ways they weren't supposed to. Almost as if the game needed another 6-12 months of development but someone decided it needed to be released now.\n\nTLDR; Buyer beware. After I finished this game I felt somewhat disappointed.","February 10","false","5.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First of all, the game is about 3 1/2 hours long. Maybe a little longer if you take your time and read every little piece of text you find throughout the game. Also Firewatch isn't a game in the classic sense. I think people might fall into trap to think this is some kind of survival game. You can't die, you won't gather resources and you won't build stuff.\n\nThis is more like an interactive experience. And by far the most important part of said experience is the conversation between you, the protagonist, and Delilah, your only real contact to the outside world. Through this conversation you will learn about both of their backstories and thanks to the amazing voice acting you'll most likely enjoy the chemistry between both of them.\n\nThe rest of the game is more or less a hiking simulator. That isn't a bad thing though. I found it to be deeply satisfying to wander through the beautifuly crafted world, accompanied by the many dialogue options you'll have when talking to Delilah on the radio.\n\nThe story that ties everything together mostly kept me on the edge of my seat and therefore I found it very easy to finish the whole game in one sitting. Be warned though, even though the game's setting is certainly atmospheric and creepy, this is not a horror game. If walking through the woods alone, being paranoid about noises, is enough to grind your gears, then this will suffice to you.\n\nOverall this is a very well crafted, albeit short, interactive experience with especially great voice acting. The price at about $20 is a bit steep but justifiable. If you're open to alternative storytelling and aren't appalled by the idea of hiking through the woods, this might be for you.","February 9","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is a great setup, tremendous innuendo that hints at a great mystery, and a world that quickly sucks you into the story. The problem is that the game cannot sustain this for the final act. And the grand reveal is - unfortunatly - underwhelming.\n\nThe game spends a long time setting up conflicts that are never actually explored. And at the end, i was quite convinced that  i hadn`t seen the "true" ending, because all of the conflict and mystery i was invested in was tossed aside.\n\nI wont spoil the story. When I read reviews that complain about story i often find that super subjective. If anything, i take statements like these as challenges to see the story myself. And if you are a skeptic like me and do play it, i think you will agree the setup is amazing. You wanna see the end of the mystery, There are these weird unexplained events, and the things you say trap you in the unwraveling mystery. But i warn you, the ending does not do the story justice. There are plot holes everywhere at the end.\n\nAnd its such a shame! The VO work is great, and the walkie talkie mechanic really grounds the characters. There are tons of little treats to be examined everywhere you look, and its such a pleasure that they feed into the mystery and suspense of Firewatch. The world is beautiful, and the exploring mechanics - especially early on - fire off all of the good brain chemicals.\n\nBut i cannot stress this enough: the ending takes all of the goodwill the game builds up for three hours and betrays it. It doesn`t accomplish it by making the characters do something without choice (a la Mass Effect 3 forcing you into a set of choices) or by an ending that disregards the players choices (a la bioshock infinite). Its not a cliche or even a nonsensical twist.\n\nThe ending is just deeply dissapointing.\n\nPlay it yourself and see. If there turns out to be a true ending, i would be totally willing to reconsider. But for now, its a character study that portrays itself as a mystery. The ending is not bad in a subjective way, i think. Its bad in how it sets up the characters and our relationship with them in a way that is deliberatly manipulative.\n\n------------\ntl;dr\nGreat Setup, Great Characters, Great VO work.

You never really see other people up close, but you do have a radio buddy that keeps you company. The game styles itself "an adult game about adults having adult conversations" and that's a pretty apt description. Sadly, the ending is incredibly simplistic and fails to tie together any of the storylines or themes.\n\nThe best part of Firewatch is the writing and voice acting. The main lead is Rich Sommer (you know him as Harry Crane from Mad Men) and he nails this role. Cissy Jones is a video game mainstay and she delivers wonderfully as well. Put them together and you have a legitimately funny yet poignant conversation that basically continues for the entire length of the game. The same story without them would've been a shadow of itself.\n\nThe graphics are simple but well executed and consistently styled. The music, on the other hand, is amazing. Some of my favorite moments in the game would have been boring walks through the woods without the music. Each track managed to transform idle time into something serene and precious.\n\nThe mechanics are largely like any other "walking simulator." I've had such good experiences with that moniker that even though I know it started as an insult I'm beginning to think developers should take it as a complement. The single biggest problem with Firewatch's particular implementation is that there is a minimum distance to interact with objects. Watching someone struggle with trying to climb a rope they are right next to is painful. "No you need to back up. You need to be farther away from the rope to climb it." That's advice anyone playing this game should take to heart, but it's stupid that it has to be given in the first place. There's also a bizarre bug where the reticle can be partially on an object, but then pressing shift to bring up the radio moves the reticle off the object. Talk about frustrating and unintuitive. Though other than those complaints the game plays like you would expect.\n\nIf you're looking for a game where the focus is on the journey instead of the destination then you should pick up Firewatch. The ending is truly disappointing compared to what it could have been. It's almost like the developers had less of an imagination than the people playing their game. I'm holding out hoping for some alternate, apocryphal interpretations to gain traction. Until then, the journey alone is well worth the price.","May 16","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The relationships and characters this game supplies are believable and genuine, the emotions and suspense truly grip your heart. The ending may not be as big a twist as you may have been hoping for, but it seems natural, a logical consequence of everything that's happened, not contrived in the least. The music makes an amazing and fitting counterpiece to the happenings of the park.\n\nI have noticed some minor gameplay glitches and some few graphic artifacts, but apart from that my only real complaint would be the short game time. If you explore absolutely everything, you're looking at 6 hours at the most, and that's if you're going at a very sluggish pace (not that that's a bad thing; quite the opposite really), more likely 4-5. Still, the "realness" of the heartfelt dialogue more than make up for it in my opinion.\n\nBe aware, though, that this game focuses on character and its development most of all. Exploration, gameplay, and even story are only minor concerns, so if that's not something you're looking for, you'd probably be better off with some other game.","February 9","true","4.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game lasts about 4 to 6 hours, depending on how much you explore and how many conversations do you respond or engage.\n\nThe main game mechanic would be the conversation aspect of the game. There's no action or much in th way of puzzles.\n\nThere are lots of choices and conversation trees but at the same time there are several plot points that will always occur and while how they are approached can vary depending on the conversations you have, they'll play out the same. So there aren't wildly different endings in this game.\n\nIn my opinion this probably going to game of the year for me. Let me explain.\n\nVideo games, for a while now, have been fighting for the right to be labeled as an art form, like film and literature and theater for example. However what is most interesting to me is that a significant portion of the gaming community is still thinking in an old way. A lot of people have called this a "walking Simulator", it's almost as if a lot of people don't know what to do when confronted with a game that focuses on telling a story versus what score do you get, or achievement you earn.\n\nLet's call this work what it should be called. It's a Thriller. And if you desperately need to remind people that it's an electronic medium then Interactive Thriller could work.\n\nThe community can't function without trying to out this game in the typical "game" boxes which is why you'll still hear, *it's too short" "It's too linear" "There aren't any side quests" "where are the achievements" "no multi-player" etc.\n\nTo those who would argue it's too short and too expensive for the money. $20 for 4 to 6 hours of well written and acted content isn't a waste. If you'll pay that much for a movie ticket that you can only view one time then this is definitely justified in price.\n\nI am curious how can people complain about how it's too linear? It's clearly telling a story with a beginning, middle and end. While the conversation choices add variety, it is a story and it doesn't need to have giant multi faceted story possibilities.\n\nThe gaming industry, in comparison to the other mediums, is still very young. And we still have a long way to go. I can tell you that Firewatch is one of the few games released so far that is trying to make the statement that an interactive medium is just as powerful as a way to tell a story as a passive one. We need more games like this.\n\nThis game is beautiful visually, a very well chosen  art style.\n\nThe voice acting between the two characters is so well done that if it were for an animated movie it would receive such high acclaim.\n\nThis game would have made a good book or film in its own right and it knew how to keep me continuing on.\n\nPlay this game if you want to support good story telling in video games.\n","February 12","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you don't like things like that, better off not buying this game\n\nIn my opinion, this game has a good story and it builds up really nice. The ending may not look like a good one, but I expected it ends that way and it fits. It's trying to tell about human emotions and morale, questioning about what would you do if it's in their position and again it's not about action and stuff.\n\nHowever, overall story is quite short. You could probably finish it in 2-3 hours if you are not really exploring other areas (or trying to grab books from from caches and places, go back and place them to your tower, yeah I did that).\n\nThe gameplay is really straight foward, you'll be immediately introduced with basic items on the 1st day and other things on further days which can be used to aid you to open up some locked path. I like the camera, where they allow us to capture photos and send them back to firewatch website to see any pictures you have taken. It's really a great idea and I love it!\n\nGraphicwise, as I believe one of the main factor in the game. The game is a really piece of art. The flat cartoonish graphic which looks stunning with well built environment designs. I have no grudges to what they've done to it. Cheers to them!\n\nThe soundtracks are amazing as well! It really fits with the atmosphere! But some time it plays the music pretty randomly at some area. It may be attended though to enrich the feels, but I don't see why they set the music at certain area.\n\nThere are some bugs here and there, like stuck in some trees, which forces you to load the latest save or restart day to unstuck yourself. Some minor grapich bugs, like some models clipping to each other and some missing polygons. But you can barely see it if you are not paying attention.\n\nOverall, great game! The game really does give me chill down to the spline. Especially after you finding out what happens to the story and the credits part is really a nice touch! (you have to play it to know understand what I said)  and breathtaking sceneries as well!\n\nPS : Oh, and woot woot! James Benson is at it again with his animations! I kinda recognise his animation style in this game, but never thought it would be really him until I saw his name in the credits.

The vivid colours and ambient detail,the humour both cynical and sarcastic, caustic and somber between Henry and Delilah, the story, the utter and absolute tragedy of the core story and of both Henry and Delilah's back story mixed with the back and forth radio comminique between these two had me almost in tears at times both sad one's and delightful one's.\n\nI have no idea about how re-playable this game can be, maybe I will wait a few months before trying but it was the most delightful gaming experience I have had for a long time, sheer genius!\n\nGameplay is fairly linear, rather like a walking simulator with some aspects of exploration. It tells a wonderful story, is beautiful to look at. It has humour, sadness, some dialogue choices though I have no idea how each choice changes things after just one playthough but and I won't spoil this I hope, after Henry makes a discovery and reports it to Delilah and she breaks down in tears, I was crying alongside her, she was heartbroken, I was too. Whomever did the voice casting for this should be awarded whatever accolades go to the industry for this type of work, they played it so perfectly, flawless.\n\nSo I say goodbye to Henry, to Delilah, to Bucket Jnr and to the Flapjack fire with a great deal of sadness that we are parting like old friends. Maybe I'll come back next summer and we can chat again like old times.\n\nOh one final adieu, taking pictures in the game didn't seem relevant until the ending credits rolled...and there were all my pictures on display right alongside the words.

Firewatch is proabably one of the most visually pleasing games I have ever seen, if you can't tell by all the screenshots I have. The story grabs you right from the begining and shoots you right in the heart. Then once you begin it brings it right back up on just how beautiful it is. Next they introduce you to Delilah in which you grow and bond with over your summer. She always right there with you on the walkie joking with you and helping you through your summer. Also she help point out some of the amazing views and colors in this game. Then they try to add in some weird twist, which I am not personally a fan of, but does had to this story. With that I think the story starts out amazing and jsut grows until it reachs this twist where I think it declines from there.

Also the game it's self is fairly short, I completed it in only 4 hours, with that though if felt a lot longer to me, about double the time .Overall I would highly recommend this game just for the visuals, they are a amazing, alone and the mostly good story doesn't hurt it either.

I found myself thinking ahead alot, which made me worry, over thinking and adding to the mystery of the story.\n\nI RECOMMEND TURING OFF MAP LOCATION.\n\nMakes the game a bit harder, especially that first hour or so until you have gone down the path a few times. Takes a bit of skill to figure where you are on the map without a little dot, but I enjoy it and am very glad the devs included that option.\n\nThis game may be a bit steep on price so hours/price ratio, it took me 4.5 hours for my first playthrough without map location on. I explored most areas first playthrough, but not all, taking my time to enjoy the views though, playing it through the eyes of Henry (Hank) If you are unsure, wait for it to go on a bit of a sale. I viewed this as my monthly movie ticket, and was not disapointed.\n\nI hope the devs either revist this story, this world, or this game engine, and create the game we are all craving after finshing this.

It has about 4 hours worth of play time and quite little replay value.\n\nThe story, while exciting at times, feels a bit lacking in areas and I feel they could have done so much more with the tension and the relationship between Henry and Delilah. As the story unfolded I was coming up with a whole number of exciting theories that could have made for an epic conclusion, but sadly the ending is fairly bland and doesn't provide any real sort of closure. A missed oppertunity.\n\nIn hindsight I don't think the 18 bucks I spent on this game were really worth it, let alone the 20 it costs now. 12 to 15 dollars is probably a more realistic price for a short adventure game like this.\n\nNone the less, I did enjoy playing and I would recommend it if it comes at a price you are okay with for a 4 hour game.","February 10","true","4.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I would recommend learning as little as possible about the story. I just took the plunge, and went in with the mindset that this was a fairly linear yet mysterious game/story. I found myself thinking ahead alot, which made me worry, over thinking and adding to the mystery of the story.\n\nI RECOMMEND TURING OFF MAP LOCATION.\n\nMakes the game a bit harder, especially that first hour or so until you have gone down the path a few times. Takes a bit of skill to figure where you are on the map without a little dot, but I enjoy it and am very glad the devs included that option.\n\nThis game may be a bit steep on price so hours/price ratio, it took me 4.5 hours for my first playthrough without map location on. I explored most areas first playthrough, but not all, taking my time to enjoy the views though, playing it through the eyes of Henry (Hank) If you are unsure, wait for it to go on a bit of a sale. I viewed this as my monthly movie ticket, and was not disapointed.\n\nI hope the devs either revist this story, this world, or this game engine, and create the game we are all craving after finshing this. Perhaps a DLC with another story line in the same "world"\n\nGood game, if it interest you at all, get it, if not, its probably not for you anyway.","February 9","true","6.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Personally, I enjoyed it. It is extremely short, (2.5-3 hrs long)\nBut the experiences you will have in those hours are the most memorable hours you will have with any story-driven game.\n\nGameplay\nFirewatch is like a Telltale game, but you can move around and interact with the world semi-freely. You can pick up objects and examine them LANoire-style, and piece together story dialouge. If you are the type of the guy who rushes in and likes to blow things up, This probably not for you. If you like taking things slow and steady, observing every little detail, this game will be your soul mate.\n\nStory\nThe story of firewatch is voiced, written, and delivered excepionally well. You can feel and hear the emotions in any character's dialouge, from the teeth jittering of realizing how ♥♥♥♥ed you are, to Delialah (Did i spell that right) understanding she asked too many questions. It takes a new stride in a type of storytelling, and im too afraid to spoil anything. But spoilers tho:\nDummy, i said i'm not going to spoil anything. Besides, if you already played the game and know the spoilers, why the hell are you reading this?\n\nAsthetics/Atmosphere\nFirewatch has a unique artstyle. from the indigo-smothered nights of mystery to the orange-baked rocks of Thunder Canyon, the atmosphere is very immersive. Your immersion may be broken a couple of times due to glitches, but you can glide past them.\n\nGraphical Fedelity\nGraphics aren't the new XXX_MLG_COD3_ADVANCEDFISHAI_GWAPHIX_XXX, But they are just enough to support the game. It's soft, warm, and likely won't need a monster computer to run.\n\n\n\nTotal Score: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n","February 9","true","3.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Many people will hate it, but it's because this game is not what they thought it would be, not because it's a bad game.\n\nIt's hard to explain why you may like or not this game without spoiling the surprises of it has, because, while many compare it to Gone Home, I'd say it's more like The Stanley Parable or The Beginner's Guide: It plays with your expectations. Even if it does so in a more subvertive way.\n\nSo I'll give it a try and tell you first what Firewatch IS NOT:\nIt's not a fully open world adventure game\nIt's not full of action\nThe ending is more akin to a Stephen King Story to an J.J. Abrahams or John Katzenbach one (take that as you will)\nIt's not a good thriller (despite what the trailers may led you to believe)\nFirewatch doesn't give you a lot room to bend or shape the story. The characters are pretty well stablished and know what they want and who they are. You sort of help them pick reactions to some stuff but you're mostly a passanger in this unfolding story. You've been warned.\n\nWhat Firewatch is is...\nA very human story\nA self contained story with an open-ended ending\nA game that let's you explore in the same way Mafia II does: You can deviate from the path and see what you may find, but the story pushes you in very specific directionAll in all, Firewatch is a very unique game, one you can honestly love if you know what you're getting into and let yourself be indulged by it's mesmerizing views and involving script. But, like some of those cozy books one reads under the sheets in a cold and lonely winter, it is a game you need to go into in the right mood.\n\nI hope I've given you an idea of what Firewatch is and wether you may find it as amazing as I did or just not worth your time. I also hope I did so without spoiling all the fun it might give you!","February 10","true","9.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","1"

Without spoiling the opening text based dialogue(great is fantasticly written by the way) He and his wife run into hard times and Henry decides to get away from it all by taking a job as a Firewatchman in Wyoming. While he works his  job he talks with his boss Delilah over their radios. The interaction between these 2 characters is some of the most well written and well voiced dialogue I can remember and you will not get tired of hearing their voices. I really don't want to ruin any of the main story because it unfolds in such a perfect way that you really have to discover for yourself to get the true impact of what's actually going on but they find out that some pretty 'creepy' stuff is going on.\nOnto the gameplay, as I said earlier it is a story driven game so you don't do much other than walk from place to place talking with your boss and uncovering the next part of the mystery of whats happening in the woods around you.\nThe visuals are simply stunning and the art style is spot on, there isnt really much else I can say.\nOther than the sound of Henry and Delilah's voices, there is the wind and the occasional music score when you find something relating to the main story.\n\nAll this being said it isnt a perfect game, the constant hiking can get a little bit boring the story will keep you going. My other gripe with this game is the ending, much like a lot of other people I felt like I was left empty handed. It does wrap up the story but not in the way I would have liked.\n\nI'll a little about the performance now, I ran this on a i6500 and a GTX 960 on ultra @1080p and hardly dipped below 60fps other than when sometimes taking out the map when it would dip to 40-45.\n\nAll in all/TL; DR, I really enjoyed this game. The story was great, the voice acting is great, the visuals are great. I would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone who doesnt mind not being able to shoot everything in sight and appreciates a well paced story.\n\n9/10.","May 12","true","5.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The story could've been great, the exploration could've been awesome, and the gameplay could've been something fun.  Instead it was a story that missed every opportunity available, exploration that was non existent, and gameplay that involved walking from one place to another, looking at something, then walking away.  I have always been a "about the journey not the end" kind of gamer but it is hard to get jazzed about an on the rails journey where huge swaths of time are skipped over, and relationships get no time to build.  This game is beautiful, and when the sound doesn't glitch, has amazing voice acting and sound design.  It also has an awesome premise with good characters.  That stuff doesn't mean ♥♥♥♥ though, when nothing is allowed to develop and there is no gameplay to back it up.  The "OH ♥♥♥♥" moments carried no impact, and the tension was light enough to breath.  Would I reccomend this game? Sure, for less than five bucks.  It says I have 5 hours on this game.  3 1/2, no ♥♥♥♥ing lie here, was when I took a break to snog my wife, grab something to eat, and drink a few beers while it was paused.  GTFO!!!!

Most of this time you will be either walking or jogging through some awe-inspiring landscapes. If that's not the case, then you're reading a note or climbing rocks. That's about it, but that does not have to be negative. The story you're being told is nicely introduced and for the time playing entertaining and affecting, but I don't see it to be outstandingly well written or to be having a major impact on your thoughts. The story in combination with the superb voice-acting and the gorgeous and sheer beautiful artstyle produce a very intense atmosphere, although the story part ceases to support it that well towards the end in my humble opinion. Like I've just mentioned: The graphics are absolutely stunning and beautiful and the voice-acting is amazing and outstanding.\n\nNow that you know, what I experienced while playing the game, let me elaborate, why I do recommend it.\nIt is by no means a clear recommendation for it really depends on your expectations towards this game. If you want to have a short-lasting but nice story with astounding visuals, superb voice-acting and if you don't mind the price, go get it. If you want value for your money, I would not recommend it for the price of 18$ for ~5$/hour is a bit expensive. I would also not recomend the game to anyone, who wants to take lead in a game and who wants to have game-mechanics to work with other than walking. But why do I recommend it overall? Because it is something special and unusual. In times of the sixtieth Assassin's Creed and the many early-access survival games, I like the idea of a game like this. It is small but good and does not aspire to be something other than what it is. The story is nice but thats about it. The graphics and the voice-acting are perhaps, from an objective point of view, the best parts of the game but I value the whole package. It has its flaws, but kept me entertained for an evening, and in the end I think that's what matters most.","February 10","true","3.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I could understand if I just rushed through the story, but I took my time, explored the map, and got up to do some work for about twenty minutes and still only lasted about three hours\n-Just an okay ending to the game. Nothing great, nothing awful.\n\nOverall I'd say the game is worth looking into, but twenty dollars is a little steep for the playtime to dollar ratio. The story itself wasn't anything all that fantastic to justify it either.\n\nWhen it goes under ten dollars it's a definite pickup.

Firewatch is not a sub-par game because it has limited player interaction, it is a sub-par game because it sacrifices that interaction for a story that is inconsequential, is amateurishly presented, and ends without a climax.\nI don't think Firewatch is a terrible game, it's just somewhat mediocre. The first two thirds do a good enough job to build up the mystery but the final act is a big letdown. I feel as though people are fighting to support this game partly because they are trying to support the emerging genre of so called "walking simulators" in order to give more legitimacy to video games as an art form. But if you really want video games to evolve then you can't be afraid to criticize them when they misstep. Criticism is how an artist learns. There are enough genuinely good games of this type (Gone Home, Stanley Parable, Journey) that we don't need to excuse the bad ones (Dear Esther, Everybody's gone to the Rapture, ... The Witness).","February 11","false","4.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I got a solid 5 hours out of my first playthrough.. but I'll probably go back and see how things might have happened if I'd done things differently.\n\nEither way, The experience I got was worth the price of admission. For me, anyway.  This isn't for everybody.  It's essentially an adventure game.  It's not full of action or combat or anything like that.  You're exploring a world, uncovering and shaping a story, and getting immersed in your role as Henry as you do so.. learning about the only human you have contact with via a walkie-talkie, and making choices.  If you're not into that, well.. really, you should've already figured out you wouldn't like a game like this from watching the trailers and stuff.\n\nI see a lot of people complaining about the length, or saying that this is just a "walking simulator."  Whatever.  It was still one of the most engaging experiences I've had in months.  I will remember this game and the impact it had on me for a long time.\n\nI won't say anything else, because I might spoil something if I do.. All I'll say is that it grabbed me tight, and I couldn't help but complete the whole game in one sitting.

The voice acting is spectacular! The devs definitely put a lot of work into this game, and it (mostly) shows.\n\nI do feel bad for giving it a "negative" review. I wish there was an option between yes and no, because I am torn about how to feel with this game. This game is really great in many ways, and I look forward to seeing more Campo Santo creations, no doubt. There is lots of potential! Unfortunately...\n\nThe reason why I have to give it a thumbs down... the plot, to me, is a huge letdown. There is so much suspense built up that I expected a much more intriguing and satisfying ending. Ideas like  the missing teenage girls, D's overheard phone call near the start, being stalked, the whole thing being 'in your head'  are just completely blown off, and instead you get lame, boring explanations and a lackluster ending. It almost feels like the writers didn't know what to do with all the tension they were able to create, and just gave up.\n\nThere are other problems with the story, such as certain plotholes, the illusion of choice, some weird unexplained parts that left me confused, the many aspects that could have been so much more, etc. etc. but I won't make you read an essay. For a game that is so driven by the plot, these are big problems that can't be overlooked.\n\nFinal point, which is probably the dealbreaker. This game is normally $20, but a single playthrough lasts anywhere from 3-6 hours (took me almost 4), and there is little replay value. It's kinda reminiscient of the Gone Home fiasco. For a lot of people, that kind of thing is unacceptable. I personally wouldn't mind paying that much, IF the plot was good enough. Too bad for this game, it really doesn't live up to what it could have been.\n\n(If they made a DLC that included many of the skipped days, where you're just doing normal park ranger things, discovering the history, and talking to D, I would be much more satisfied! wink wink nudge nudge)","February 11","false","3.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

There are two competing and equally reasonable viewpoints about this game, and I still don't know which side I find myself on even still.\n\nOn the one hand, this game is immensely polished in its graphics, gameplay, voicework and interface. If you read the comments from the team members who worked long nights for years building it, you really get a feel for the passion they put into the game and how much they cared about it all this time. For a freshman effort from an indie studio, this is an immensely impressive game, and I think our saturation with cheap AAA titles has led us to expect the world from these tiny teams.\n\nOn the other hand, I agree with many who say that the retail price seemed a little steep to me for a game with about 4 hours of total play time and not very much replayability. The storyline is quite linear, and while you can occasionally wander around off the beaten path, there isn't enough of that side material to justify playing the whole game through again.\n\nSo the question has to be, is this worth $15 or $20 or whatever to you?\n\nIf you're like me, without a reliable stream of income, it hurts the wallet a little more to think that I only got 4 good hours out of this, and I probably won't pick the game up again. Years of Steam sales and Humble Bundles have spoiled me by giving me dozens upon dozens of hours of replayable entertainment at pennies on the dollar. This game doesn't make that same value proposition, but once you realize that it's coming from an indie studio, it makes more sense why they're asking that amount for it. They've gotta keep the lights on, after all.\n\nConsider it a compliment to the game and Campo Santo that it's so well-polished in so many respects that, at first, I assumed it was just pushed out by another big name publisher who wouldn't care about one refund in the big picture. You might get that feeling after playing it, too, but remember that this isn't a product put out by a giant, monolithic company, but rather a small and hard-working team of people. I wouldn't dare ask for a refund knowing that.","February 15","true","4.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I hope they make more games like this.\n\nSadly, it seems there a vocal minority of people who are very salty that most folks enjoyed the game for what it was. Maybe they will do the research next time before blindly making a purchase and blaming everyone else for their own ignorance. They can complain all they want, this game is still a top seller with mostly positive reviews.

While the map isn't huge, and some days are short, exploration is still there.\n\nAdmittedly there's not much to explore, but I did feel rewarded for it, even if it meant hiking back to point A, after finding point B and wandering off to get the map points.\n\nWhile there isn't much to actually do, besides progressing the story, the narrative is just so masterly crafted, I wouldn't mind getting another game like this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stoibs/recommended/383870/","Stoibs","Stoibs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stoibs/","2788 products in account","Another great entry into the narratively story driven exploration genre.\nThe story sucker punches you in its prologue and puts you into the shoes of an everyman struggling with an unavoidable conflict who decides to find serenity and take a break in the position of a fire lookout operator in Wyoming national park circa late 1980's.\n\nWhat starts as a routine set of tasks and daily occurrences quickly turns into something that appears more sinister and throws the protagonists into a mystery to uncover. With only a radio and a voice on the other end of the line to a fellow tower operator, the feeling of isolation and helplessness reigns true as you delve deeper into the goings on and emotions start to shape and form what they perceive as the truth at the end of the rabbit hole.\n\nSpecial mention has to go to the dialogue and voice acting as a whole for the two characters (The player character Henry - and Delilah, the voice on the radio) as they do a superb job and have some of the most believable and down-to-earth deliveries that I've seen in a game. The conversations flow quite naturally and make seamless references to other things you've talked about or seen, or in some cases stumbled across beforehand out of sequence. Plenty of genuine laugh out loud moments through this banter in the early portions too and the range of emotions varies as topics such as Henry's home life and reason for being here surface.\n\nHas some beautiful scenery and lighting effects that I've stopped and admired at times, and an eerily somber soundtrack that picks up and backdrops during certain plot points or after particular revelations that added to the experience nicely.\n\nA lot of people are concerning themselves with the length as if this were a replayable RPG or third person shooter to speedrun, I valued and enjoyed this for the story experience and clocked in at 4.2 hours personally. While there are a few optional side areas to explore and more notes/radio conversations to uncover, it does have to be stated that it is more of a linear narrative experience first and foremost.\nAt the end of the day a movie ticket for me would cost a similar $17.99 and provide about half that in length of storytelling and narrative, the quality of each comparatively obviously being subjective based on a case by case basis. So to me I have no regrets and found it justified, this is certainly going to be a point of contention and a turn-off for others though I gather.\n\nSimply put it's not a game for everyone or for people who aren't into this particular genre and I can't for the life of me understand why non-fans of this established genre would even be so vocal and hate-filled that they appear to be on the message boards. But if you *are* a fan and did enjoy similar styles of art such as Gone Home or Dear Esther etc. as much as I did, then this should definitely be on your wishlist.","February 10","true","5.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

You’re in the middle of the Shoshone national forest in Wyoming and your every decision has a consequence, from what you decide to do with the most mundane of items, to how you treat and talk to other people. It’s all about being human, making connections and making decisions.\n\nFirewatch is a short, succinct, game that tells the story it wants to tell. It offers a real look at developing relationships, choice and consequence, all with the beautifully rendered backdrop of the Shoshone national forest. It's a game that will stick with you beyond the finish and one that you'll want to go back to.\n\nYou can read my full review over at WCCFTech[wccftech.com].","February 9","true","11.5"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","15","28","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyCanuck84/recommended/383870/","CrazyCanuck84","CrazyCanuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyCanuck84/","859 products in account","OverviewSkip to the end for pros, cons and a quick summary.\nFirewatch is a fairly short, story-driven adventure game by Campo Santo.\nPlaying as Henry, you head to Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming, having taken a summer job as a lookout. Your job is to spot fires and report them, but of course, you wind up doing more, thanks to your ever present companion Delilah, your boss. As soon as you begin your day, you’re tasked with finding people setting off some fireworks, and after that, your journey begins.\n\nLet’s get it out of the way: Firewatch is short. If you take your time, explore the wilderness, talk to Delilah about pretty much anything, you’ll finish the game between five and six hours. If you rush to the conclusion, and only talk about what’s necessary to advance the story, you could probably do it in a couple hours. While the game is short, it is priced accordingly. If this were a $60 game, you’d have every right to be mad. But as it’s under $20, and with Firewatch being known to be short, you’ve no reason to argue about value for money, or being misinformed.\n\nThroughout the game, you’ll explore various locations. The wilderness is “open”, but it’s also restricted. You’re blocked in by rocks, outcroppings, thick brush. Some of these will open later when you come across certain items, but not all of them. And don’t let the map size fool you. When you’re viewing your paper map, the wilderness may look big, but hiking from the north end to the south doesn’t take much time at all.\n\nThe story starts off really well. It maintains its intrigue throughout most of the game, but starts to falter at the end, and winds up not being as good as you had hoped. The story is pretty decent, and I did not expect it to end the way it did, but the ending seemed like a bit of a copout, unfortunately, and did not have the oomph I was expecting.\n\nThat said, the dialogue between Henry and Delilah is astounding. It’s very smooth and flows naturally, thanks to excellent voice acting by both people, as well as a very well written script. While the main story doesn’t change much throughout the game, the little touches are what make it fun. Naming the first hill you come across is reflected on your map, and slightly changes the dialogue. Telling Delilah how you look determines something you see near the end of the game. Even the introductory sequence with how you met and lived with Julia changes dialogue options later on in the game.\n\nThe game looks beautiful. The sun shines and reflects off of the environment, the environment is a joy to explore, there are nice details everywhere. Henry looks a bit odd when you see his hands, they look oddly sized, but the rest of the game is astounding. Campo Santo has crafted a fantastic version of Shoshone National Forest.\n\nWhen it comes to sound, the game is great as well. You can hear rustling in the bushes, water rushing, leaves underfoot crunching, and various environmental sounds. Music is very limited, but works well in what it does. It cuts in at story moments, crecendos when it needs to, and works well within the story of the game. As mentioned earlier, it really is the dialogue between Henry and Delilah that is the selling point of Firewatch.\n\nUnfortunately, Firewatch does not have much replayability once complete. It’s definitely worth a second playthrough to hear the alternate dialogue, but aside from that, nothing else changes. Since it’s short, a second playthrough will take you half the time. Maybe instead of having the beagle, you’ll have bought the other dog with Julia, Mayhem, and you’ll talk about him at a later point.\n\nProsExcellent graphics\nImmersive dialogue made possible with fantastic acting and a great script\nExcellent use of sound and music\nGreat story for most of it\nDisposable camera photos can be developed and mailed to you in real lifeConsFairly shot, easily finished in single sitting\nNot much replayability\nDisappointing endingSummaryFirewatch is an enjoyable experience for its six hours of game (or less, if you rush). With fantastic acting and a good script, the conversations are what you’ll be here for, with the actual story taking a backseat. Do yourself a favor, and do not rush through the game. Explore. Find the little items and report them to Delilah to hear what she has to say.\n\nAnd something that’s exclusive to the PC version, having your photos developed, is interesting. It’s definitely a novelty service, and doesn’t really add much to the game. When you do find the camera, you’ll notice it’s already been used. When you receive your developed photos, perhaps they’ll explain a bit more of the backstory. I purchased my photos just before writing this review, so I’m interested to see what will arrive in two to four weeks.","February 10","true","5.5"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","16","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/athravan/recommended/383870/","athravan","Athravan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/athravan/","863 products in account","My review for this is going to be a little different to my usual and I apologise if this comes off more as a rant but I think this is the sort of game that's very personal - this review is pure opinion! It contains spoilers (marked, don't worry!) - not specific story spoilers, but general spoilers that may give hints towards what will happen and change expectations. If you like to go into things completely blind, please don't read the following. If you don't mind some general impressions that hint at how things end but without going into specifics, read on.\n\nImagine that you're reading a book or watching a movie, and someone hears a noise in an attic. There's a lot of atmosphere, and potential for problems. Spooky things have happened. The power is out!  This noise is scary. The tension builds. Something is up there. What is going on? You don't know! No one knows. You have to find out! You're reading a ghost story. There are expectations. Now what if, after reading that entire story, giving that book several hours, investing your emotions into the characters, the end just said "And the cat jumped down and it turned out that he'd knocked a few things over during a power cut. The end." This is pure analogy - I don't want to give out specific story spoilers in such a short game, so all I  can say is that if you go into a genre with expectations and don't receive them, it can feel jarring and disappointing. In the case of walking simulators like this, I do believe they should be considered more like a book or a movie, since there is essentially no gameplay.\n\nNow Firewatch isn't a spooky ghost story - but my point is, the most obvious, boring, dull things don't make it into books, movies, or games. I had expectations for the writing; and this wasn't delivered on.\n\n"But it's about the experience, the journey, the characters!" you might say, and you would be absolutely right. Those are important things - but at the same time, the writers should be going somewhere and I felt like there was so much that this game could have delivered and it simply didn't. You shouldn't just be wasting peoples time and at the end say "Well weird things don't happen to normal people, if you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras." I don't invest my time into entertainment and media for the mundane. It is a demonstration of good writing to be able to hook people into a story and keep them gripped - but by the end this felt like half a game, like something was missing, as if development had ended too soon, and a DLC called "The Real Ending" would be announced (I wish!)\n\nIf you didn't want any suggestion of spoilers, I can sum it up by saying I was disappointed by the ending, and the general story of this game. In a walking simulator with little to no gameplay other than a progressive linear romp through admittedly beautiful visuals, the story and it's progression is critical. I loved the art, the setting and much of the dialogue. However, at £5/hour (3 hours to finish the game when developers discussed 5-6 hours so I'm not sure what happened there) I just didn't feel like this game offered value or quality entertainment for me and on that basis, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nEMPHASIS -  I do not think this is a bad game - in fact, I think it is a very good dialogue driven first person adventure, with amazing graphics and a wonderful setting. But for me, that's just not enough to recommend it. In this type of game for me, the story is the most important aspect and in this regards I felt it fell short. If you are looking for an exploration game with good dialogue and witty characters then this may suit you perfectly but ultimately I was disappointed with the experience.","February 14","false","2.3"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","17","32","0","1"

I found myself getting lost plenty of times just because I was looking at stuff. If I had a key I could give away, I definitely would to one of my friends. Overall this has been one of the few games I actually sat down and played all the way through with no breather because I was curious on what happened next.","April 14","true","6.5"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","20","38","2","0"

Everyone seems to jump on it for being short or 'on rails', but its the writing, the emotional weight to the story and the main character that sell this.\n\n*edit*\n\nOk, just finished the game. What is the issue with the ending? It didnt feel rushed, everything was tied up and I fnished it with a smile on my face (the credit seqeuence is a nice touch). Is the game short? Yes, but it felt the right length for the story. Its very much a graphic novel and playing it like this makes it that much more enjoyable. If you go in thinking its open world, its not, its a story based game and the writing is excellent and the entire game shows the love its creators had for it.\n\n\nI'd recommend this for more mature gamers or older people who like a slower paced, story driven experience.","February 10","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

He finds an ad in a newspaper for a Fire Lookout at Twoforks Park and takes the job to get away from his problems. Along the way, he's greeted by Delilah, a very chipper woman who runs you though the ropes in being a firewatchman (that's probably not an actual word, but I'm rolling with it regardless). Together you explore the forest, report any misshaps, and discover many secrets... Not all of which are pleasant.\nGameplay-wise, there isn't much to talk about since it's a very story-oriented game. You hike, climb, spelunk occasionally, and inspect/talk about nearly everything you lay your eyes on. This isn't a bad thing, however. Controlling Henry while walking through the forest is an awe-inspiring experience. From the amazing view from the watchtower to the lush, green fields and woods to the burned-down sections of the forest, you get to take in some of the most amazing visuals I've had the pleasure of witnessing. There was only one moment when I saw the end of one of the utility wires suspended in the air, but it didn't distact me for long.\nThere's a lot to say about the story but not without spoiling anything. The story was a joy to sit through the entire way and you come to care about these two characters who just want to have their own lives out in the wilderness but can't shake the feeling that someone is watching them...\nIn conclusion, this game was well worth the $16.50 (I got it on sale). If you're curious about the story but don't want to spend the money, there are plenty of YouTubers (I know Cry and Markiplier are nearing the end since writing this review) who will play it for you so you can see the story for itself. However, if you're anything like me and wants to experience a story rather than simply watch it, I highly reccommend picking it up.","February 16","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is definitely very short, but incredibly suspenseful. Props to this indie studio for coming up with a very above-average story and expressing it nicely in their game. For the record, I would not recommend to buy this game at it's full price, unless story matters the most to you, rather than gameplay.

Similar to Life Is Strange, this game has a certain aesthetic to it that almost made it a must buy for me from the graphics alone.\n\nA game is ofcourse more than graphics alone. In my opinion, this game is a must buy if you enjoy story driven games that lean towards the 'walking simulator' catergory, because that's what it does, and it does so wonderfully. Sure, the game isn't the longest, it took me a little more 3 hours to complete, but I feel like that is the perfect amount of time to tell the story in and make the player experience what the gameworld has to offer. To explain this a little more, some games feel a little 'forced' in the sense that they make you do certain things that don't add anything to the game experience itself (see Fallout 4: "Another settlement needs our help!"). This game absolutely does not do that and that what makes it the perfect length for me. They also absolutely nailed the atmosphere in the game: it did make me feel certain things at certain times which made the game great for me. (I can't really elaborate without spoiling things)\n\nHowever, there are 2 things I'd critisize the game for, and it seems like I'm not the only one in feeling that.\n\nFirst of, it doesn't really have any replayability, UNLESS you replay it for the visuals/dialog alone, to try and see if you've missed something your first time around. Other than that the story is pretty much what the game is based around and I don't think it will have the same inpact the second time playing it.\n\nThe second thing is the price point. I don't necessarily feel like the game is too expensive for what it delivered to me, but I can definitely see why you would feel otherwise. The ~€20 price point might be a little high for some people for the game it gives you and in that case I'd recommend you to wait for a sale.\n\n\nOverall though, I loved this game and I would definitely recommend it simply for the game it is.","February 9","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, the game itself is artfully executed with a lot of love and care from the developers with wonderful environments, well-crafted characters, and a lovely build-up.  With hints of the art style of The Long Dark and the tension and wonderful dialogue (and slightly misleading) from Gone Home, Firewatch has a lot of factors which make the money for the experience- but once again, this game is NOT for everyone and many people would not feel that the game is worth your time.\n\nMY RECOMMENDATION: If you do not mind an emotional story about two people’s internal struggles with some great atmosphere, induced paranoia, beautiful graphics, and well developed characters that don’t involve as much external struggle, like fighting or shooting, then I recommend this game to you!\n\nPros:\n+ A beautiful environment bursting with color.\n+ An atmosphere fitting any scenario the game thrusts you into.\n+ Branching dialogue and impressive voice acting.\n+ Emotion inducing in some parts.\n+ Henry is a badass middle-aged guy and is a likable main character and is very human.\n\nCons:\n-	NOT A HORROR GAME (could be misconstrued as one, not the fault of the game).\n-	Easily disliked by those who do not like dialogue driven stories with more emotion driven themes than an actual threat.\n-	Easily lost, even when following the map and a lot of back tracking.\n-	Getting from one point to another takes a long time, more so annoying when retracing steps BACK to a place you’ve already been. But the visuals and dialogue were interesting enough to keep me entertained.\n\n** SPOILERS **\nThe most complaints that I have seen regards the ending, which I felt turned many people off to it- expecting a government or secret organizational conspiracy but ending up with a normalized story about a man who becomes a hermit due and is an individual watching both Henry and Delilah and tapping into their walkie talkies. While I did not mind this ending, I felt that there were some unanswered questions in the end and a lot of facts used to make the player believe in the potential, large conspiracy that were not answered or solved.\nThe story is NOT about the conspiracy, it is about the individual people involved in solving his conspiracy- Henry and Delilah are our main characters with flaws and are attempting to decide what to do with situations in their lives and the story inevitably is meant to help the player guide these characters into a decision about their lives. It is an internal struggle, being driven and changed by an external struggle, for both of these characters.\n\n** Also to the reviewer who complained what Henry looked like and called him ugly- please pay more attention because his face was in a photograph and drawing since the beginning of the game **\n","May 13","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game provides you an amazing story, and graphics, but the price just doesn't match up with what the game developers are providing us. Now for some rich gamers out there this would not be a problem, but for some normal gamers, this would probably be considered. That this game has no multiplayer. Now something i like about this game, is how the dialogues work, now the game gives you options to answering conversation for example with Julia, or Delilah.

This game is simply wonderful with its gorgeous style of art/graphics. The gameplay is quite nice, despite it being mainly a walking simulater, made me feel i was there as Henry and felt I was a lookout ranger. For me, at times I felt i was playing a sims 3 type of game where i was able to look and interact with the items there. It was really cool when I was able to interact with the turtle ( when you pick him up for the first time,can't help but go aww its cute.)\n\nNow many people say they don't like the fact that it is short, around 4 hours, however to me, it didn't feel short and felt like the length of the game was right. The story was interesting and every day left me wondering what is to come next, how is this new day going to be like, what is in hold for me. Some people say the ending was kinda okay or meh, and i would sorta of agree but at the same time felt like it was a good ending to the adventure and craziness that you and delilhia encountered and discovered together throughout the 3 or so months in game. For me, talking with delilhia was fun and enjoyable to talk with and throughout the game I just simply got more and more attached to her. There is a point in the game somewhere near the end where you just don't want her to leave as for me I felt alone without her. This game is simply amazing and if looking for a great game that allows for you to choose what  to say and enjoy a great story and great feeling of building and forming a relationship, it will not disappoint.\n\n\nThere are some fps drops which were annoying but even then I still kept playing the game and did not stop me from my immersed experience with the game. This game got me hooked and just wanted to play and see what was going to happen next and what new areas  we were going to see next day.\n\nI do wish it was a  longer game but for how long the game was, I think it was still worth what i payed for it. :)\n\nWould I pay the $17 again after having just played this game (at time of this review)(pre-order) Yes I definitely would.\n\nHoped this review was helpful.\n\nP.S prefer for some feels.","February 10","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Firewatch feels like much more of game than many of its contemporaries, though. It actually has a narraive drive right from the outset and quickly sets up a mystery that you feel compelled to investigate. It also has great pacing which, unlike many of the other walking simulators, keeps you engaged with the experience. There was never a point where I found myself feeling bored, disinterested or directionless.\n\nReally, really excellent.

I wish Steam had a sideways thumb.\n\nThe choices you make in the story at the outset seem to make zero difference to the game, its choices and its outcomes. The game glitched on me for the Day 1 achievement, so I went back to play the first 30 minutes again to get it. I deliberately changed my dialog choices to see what would happen. Nothing seemed to change.  The whole back story doesn't seem to relate to the game aside from "why is he out there?" So you tramp around for a while and get told the story the developers wanted to tell you, with your choices (or desire to go somewhere different) completely ignored. A paperback novel next time, perhaps?\n\nOthers have wondered if the developers simply ran out of money. That seems like a good supposition.

The voice acting is really good and the choices you get to pick in the dialogue have a very "Fallout 3 GECK Test" type feel. Some are serious, and some are funny/rude.

You are alone and all you have is someone on the other line of the walkie talkie.\n\nThis game is beatiful, though the world isn't very lively, but  it fits so well with the narrative. I feel alone in this world which is perfect, deeper into the story every day I walk around Two Forks I feel like I am being watched. This game is gripping and after playing for two straight hours I had to take a break to calm down from the thrill I just experienced. Other than the world. On the other line of your walkie talkie you have Delilah, as i progressed through the story I felt like I needed her more and more as the plot thickened, I felt deeply connected with her and felt like I knew her more than Julia in the story which was done great, Delilah was done great and she interacts with Henry perfectly, as both of you talk more you get connected to the story and you feel so much more immersed into the story that much more. Finally I love how Henry was created, sometimes I may not have a say into what he says I still feel like I chose what he said because this game kept me so deeply connected to this character. Finally I feel like the walking mechanics are great too, Henry's movement is a little lacking but it just adds to the fear I recieve when walking around in this game knowing I can't climb over every rock I see.\n\nAll in all this game is done great, with amazing narrative and a stunning and unique world. This is a game that may need you to pay attention a little more and channel your inner feelings to decide what to say to Delilah. Overall the story is gripping but I feel like the ending was a little lacking and a sour taste in my mouth. This game is wonderfull and I recommend it to anyone willing to dive into a new world and experience mystery, fear, and emotion.","February 9","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You get a real feel for everyone in the game, best part is you design your own path. If you pick to be the clown and a goofy guy you will be that guy. So have fun with it when it asks you those types of questions, they really do matter. You never really fully understand what the hell is going on until pretty much the very end. You need to collect and read every note you see, it helps a lot. Also when you get the camera take some cool pictures  you view them later, and when I saw mine I really got the feels. Great gaming to play, even though many people watching it on streams are saying it's boring it is a game you must play yourself, hence all the options to make the guy yourself. I would give it a 8.5/10 due to the shortness of the game and the ending I wanted to see more then it would let me.","February 9","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Backround: I have finished the game and loved it but this reveiw will be unbiast. First this game isn't for an all out shooter fan, I am not saying people who like shooters will not like it I'm saying people who EXCLUSIVLEY like shooters. As a person coming from games like Just Cause 3 and Grand Theft Auto V this is an amazing change of pace. A game like this I beleive is good for one sitting but I played it in three and although it is a small game it is an amazing journey.

The ending was a bit "meh" but I didn't hate it. Overall I recommend it when the price gets lower or on a sale. I got it for $17.99 and beat the game while taking my  time and exploring in about 4 1/2 to 5 hours. I had to redo the first chapter/section because my save file got corrupted so my play time shows longer than one complete playthrough. I probably won't play this game again since there really isn't much in way of branching or alternative ending other than a few dialogue changes which I might just watch on youtube.\n\nVoice acting and dialogue was top notch, both actors nailed it. Dialogue was really funny at times and at other time held great emotion that is conveyed through their tone. They did a good job portraying life as normal in the first couple chapters only to see things get very strange and the mystery to come to life half through. The game portrayed tension very well and had me at the edge of my seat until the climax and while I didn't hate how it ended I agree with a lot of reviewers that say it was a bit unsatisfying and lost a lot of the games momentum leading up to it.\n\nIf I had to put a numerical score to it I would give it a 7.5/10","February 10","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a great game BUT i knew going into it what to expect. This is one of those "almost" a movie / interactive story style games.\n\n7.5/10\n\n(-0.5) for small performance issues hardly noticed , not crashes or anything major.\n(-1.0) for not allowing me to carry Turt Reynolds to the escape chopper.\n(-1.0) for lack of replay. (I was hoping for 2 playthroughs good / bad to see the difference.)\n\nIts not a survival game (even though it looks like it). Choices exist only to amuse you provide a bit of flavor to your tastes. Minor alterations which allow you to slightly shape the circumstances /dialog of the narrative. Is that narative worth paying for? I think so yes but go into it expecting 3-6 hours at most. I stretched it to 10 hours exploring everything I could with my pet turtle. I think he was an easter egg of some sort. Sadly I could not escape to the chopper with Turt Reynolds because mechanic reasons and limitations. Apparently one cannot push the escape lift button to cross the canyon while carrying an adorable turtle. The loss of Turt proved too emotionally damaging for me to give this game a perfect score. As he gets himself to safety your thinking NO YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PICK UP YOUR TURTLE - AHH !\n\nSeriously design an ending for saving your pet not leaving it to burn lol. (Granted I think i wasn't suposed to take him along during the final scene but what right minded person leaves their pet in a lookout tower which is said to catch fire and burn into ruin soon...\n\nAnyway that being said...\n\nGreat game, amazing visuals. Fantastic voice acting dialogue, very thought provoking story. It handles darker concepts in life some younger gamers probably don't want to face. Having lost people in my life already at a young age I can identify with the themes its trying to convey. How to find peace with yourself . ect . Good game. I don't regret paying full price.

However, those same people say that they were engaged and riveted to the end, this tells me that perhaps they are missing the point.\n\nThe game was a brilliantly crafted journey, with excellent voice acting and an incredibly engaging story. There were lulls of saftey and enjoyment, and peaks of uncertainty and concern. Nothing gave away the storyline along the way, leaving the mystery hanging in the air, allowing your imagination to go wild, and letting you contemplate what might be going on.\n\nThe game didn't resort to any tropes or deus ex machina like circumstances in order to make it feel like a blockbuster movie, it simply made sure to tell the story it intended to tell and stayed authentic and true to that goal. It was an incredibly refreshing journey, and just because the ending didn't have you diving off a cliff into a helicopter or being chased by an axe wielding murder, does not discredit the journey you took.\n\nThere were definitely lessons to learn along the way, but if your focus is on the ending then you may just miss them.","February 13","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I love story-driven games, so I think it was worth it, but you might not.\n\nHowever,\nThat's not to say the game wasn't good, it was amazing. After about 15 minutes of playing I was fully immersed in the story and quickly lost track of time. The story here is amazing. The environments are done in an extremely beautiful art style that suck you into the world and make you want to stay. But the gameplay is very limited. You click to interact with things, but that's about all you can do.\n\nThe story is more or less what you make of it. If you like speedrunning through games just to get the required bits, you'll miss so much. I highly suggest you explore everything you can to get as much detail as possible about the world.

Yes, the game is short but its the perfect length to where it isn't drug on to be something it's not and seeing as to how each choice you make changes the outcome of the game, you can replay it over again and get something different. The environment is astounding both visually and audibly, the voice acting is unlike any other game I have played. The animations are by far the most fluid I've seen, better than any AAA studio has ever produced. This game evokes utter immersion with a hard hitting story coupled with such a rich environment and voice acting, all are essential for any single player game today. All these elements make you feel like you're alive within the world.\n\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing game and I for one am impressed at how easy it is to get lost within this story, I am going to replay it again tomorrow, with different choices from my first time and see how much of a different story I am able to produce. I would strongly recommend this game.","February 9","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very simple, but stunning.\nLots of walking, allowing time for the story to progress and the visuals to be seen.\nNEGATIVES:\nRather anticlimactic ending.\nCompleted in roughly 3 hours and 40 minutes.\nLots of walking.\nOVERVIEW\nI highly recommend this game. The gameplay is very simple, but you are kept interested through the progression of the story and interactive conversations. The design of the game is sexy as ♥♥♥♥ and I am in love with how gorgeous it is. There is a lot of walking in the game which allows the story to advance, but it may seem monotonous to some. It's also rather short and has an anticlimactic ending. If you let those last few factors turn you off, I don't blame you, but I highly recommend that you try it first.

However, those same people say that they were engaged and riveted to the end, this tells me that perhaps they are missing the point.\n\nThe game was a brilliantly crafted journey, with excellent voice acting and an incredibly engaging story. There were lulls of saftey and enjoyment, and peaks of uncertainty and concern. Nothing gave away the storyline along the way, leaving the mystery hanging in the air, allowing your imagination to go wild, and letting you contemplate what might be going on.\n\nThe game didn't resort to any tropes or deus ex machina like circumstances in order to make it feel like a blockbuster movie, it simply made sure to tell the story it intended to tell and stayed authentic and true to that goal. It was an incredibly refreshing journey, and just because the ending didn't have you diving off a cliff into a helicopter or being chased by an axe wielding murder, does not discredit the journey you took.\n\nThere were definitely lessons to learn along the way, but if your focus is on the ending then you may just miss them.","February 13","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

But the first part of that: the escaping into the woods part is what Firewatch really focuses on.\n\nThe game gets a lot right when it comes to presenting a narrative and environment to explore. Its world is fleshed out and there is no doubt of who you are or where you’re going.\n\nWhere the game falls short and where a lot of review negativity surrounding this game comes from the game also having a console release.  I believe the marketing for this game was sort of presented it as an action/mystery game. Trailers showed things like falling down a shale cliff or a stranger shining a flashlight in your face with a panicked voice-over. If that action/mystery is what you’re here for, you may be disappointed.\n\nThis game does have elements of mystery, it does have elements of action but it is neither an action nor a mystery game. Its core experience is the relationship between people who want to be left alone but can’t ever escape their need for others.\n\nMost players won’t find this experience worth the $20.00 price-tag. It’s well written and beautiful and considering the size of the studio and the stunning graphic and voice work I felt the price was fair but for those who are merely curious I suggest getting it when it’s on sale at -50%.","February 13","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though I was kinda expecting puzzels as most adventure games use to add filler and content into the game, I was really lead into sort of a Radio Simulation / Forest Lookout kind of scenes, now I am gonna be honest I came into this game thinking it was gonna be a good laugh with maybe some interesting story elements, yea well, started and played the game and laughed my ♥♥♥ off through the first few days. Good work on the Play acting, this I give a whopping 95 / 100, which AAA Titles I rarely give more than 90, so Woot Campo, Shame Big Titles.)\n\nGameplay / Performance - Game runs smooth, beautiful hardly any kind of slow downs or inital bugs on release, very nice, Fallout 4 nice. I am proud of indie developers when their games come out and show such dedication towards their code, and game structure that other big titles think they'll fix in a couple patches down the road, I am talking to you Firaxis (XCOM 2), though Cid Meiers: Beyond Earth was pretty okay on release and was glad for something similar to Alpha Centuari for a change. Anyway off topic, Gameplay is engaging and well designed, especially how it develops as conversations change between playthoughs, its not huge, but nice, replayability comes in handy.\nA few moments of fright come into this game, especially with the wildlife and finding certain things, there were a few points I won't spoil the scenes, but lets say it made me feel like I was playing Doom 3 again with the lights off and a Imp leaps out at you from a dark corner and basically turns you butt over head from the back of your chair. Bravo Campo, that was exciting.\n\nOverall Review - 9.0 - Great job, always room for improvement, add some additional game DLC between the days that are set already, give us some additional playtime by doing so, and maybe a few additional funny scenes and we'll call it Super Indie Extravaganza, as you made me smile from playing your game. That and if you decide to get intuitive, and create a Mirror Episode for this game that puts you in the option to be Julia coming out there, and Henry is the one that gets well whatever he gets (No Spoilers here), that would be spectacular.\n\nGreat Job - Faith for Indie Games High, Faith for AAA Titles of 2016 - Moderately Low...\nReasons - SPAZ 2 Looks Beautiful - Delayed but still nice\nFirewatch - Adding some much needed flare in the game industry, we see way too much zombie $hit lately.\nTom Clancy's: The Division - Not Looking as good as when they announced it a couple years ago.\nXCOM 2: Came out really ♥♥♥♥ poor in performance with bugs, great game but gonna wait for a patch before attempting normal difficulty.","February 9","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I watched a preview gameplay on youtube and I thought to myself that I had to play this for myself. Oh was I fooled. This review might be pretty long and contain serious spoilers. TL;DR: The game has good and bad elements. It depends on how you look at it. Overall, the game isn't worth 20 EUR, not even in an alternate universe. Replayablity is a massive problem.\n\nThere are a couple of good points about the game but the rest of the stuff is BAD.\n\nLet's start with the good points:\nExcellent voice acting\nGreat dialogue\nVery intriguing beginning\n\nNow, for the rest:\n\nThe beginning is really very strong. First minutes are quite emotional, then when the game actually starts there is a really good buildup. Then it gets spooky and mysterious; however, after a while it kinda just flatlines and starts going downhill from there. Only at the very end it felt a little exciting again but that was just me thinking there's more to it than there actually is.\n\nThe game is split into days. Many days are skipped but I guess that makes sense. Some days are just tiny flashes, which I didn't really like. Other days you get to walk a lot, which is ok but gets repetitive. The world is actually extremely simple - a bunch of corridors, and you're very limited in terms of movement. There is a little bit of exploration, even though it's most likely completely unnecessary. My playthrough took a little over 5 hours, and I didn't even see everything that was in the trailers but that's not the point. I'll get back to the gameplay time later.\n\nThe ending was extremely disappointing. There is this mystery, which made me kinda paranoid. I was expecting someone to try to murder me at several points. I guess that was the point, to make the player feel paranoid. The solution of the mystery was very meh. There is no substance behind the mystery, nothing that would justify its existence. It made no sense after it was revealed. It's there just for the sake of there being a msytery, and that's bad.\n\nThe relationship buildup is interesting, and it really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off that there was a disappointing ending to this. You can also look at this as a good thing - emotional reaction from the player. What I dislike here is that the game was fooling me  all the time. From the dialogue between Henry and Delilah, I got the feeling they might want to meet. And then she just ran away. This makes me want to try to play again, just to see if there is a different ending, if there's a chance she waits there at the end. But here's the problem. I am not willing to spend another 5-6 hours of my life hodling down the W key and occasionally pressing spacebar to find out. Alright, alright, you get to press Shift pretty often...but that doesn't help. One more bad thing here is that we don't get to find out anything about what H and D actually do after the game ends.\n\nAnother major problem with the game...there is no wildlife, like none whatsoever. There is one raccoon. I also saw a butterfly. I assume there were birds I didn't notice. That's it.\n\nThere's also a pretty big hole in the story. There's this research place in the forest. It's not on the map, and Delilah doesn't know about it. This makes no sense whatsoever, since it's a university research site and Delilah has had the job for years. It should be on the map and she should know about it. It's just mystified for the sake of the mystery.\n\nNot worth the full price. If you want this game, get it during a sale when it's at a massive discount.","February 9","false","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, just when it seems like you are getting into it (when it should be like 40-50% complete maybe?) , it ends abruptly with countless plot holes, questions, and a poor ending sequence. Only a 2-3 hour play through kind of game with ZERO replay ability. For such a short game there should be WAY more branching and alternate endings. I thought initially it would be better suited in the $5-10 dollar range, but upon review I really wouldn't pay anything more than $0.99 for it due to how lacking it really is.\n\nThe developers really need to add alternate endings and more story before ANYONE should buy this game.

Kinda similar to a movie in a sense, idek right now. I know it's not about how much time i spent in it, but really, 3 hours? felt like i was taking it slow too.\n\nThe thing is, I was hoping this game would really get to me, on the feels, you know? But, I guess i'm a heartless prick, cuz I'm pretty sure I felt the feels harder in Everlasting summer, which is a free game.  And is also roughly 6-7 hours long, and has multiple endings.\n\nI'm sorry this review has little to no structure to it, but, I'm just writing down what I'm feeling about this game. I would love to give it a positive review, really. Yet, I must've put my hopes a little too high. Did it suck me in? sure, but only for 3 hours, and was really just a bunch of small talk, other than near the end, which was a fizzle. Really, was it worth $20, maybe. But it isn't really that diamond in the rough ( ALLADIN!) that i'm sure a lot of people were hoping for.\n\nNow, would I recommend it? that's a tricky one, there are tons of games that come to mind when I think recommend, games that were life changers. Games that could take so much of my time, and i would still love them. I mean, not even looking at the amount of time, the game kinda felt dull, idk, dull comes to mind, maybe ther is a better word. What I'm trying to say is that this game didn't blow me away, and I probably won't tell my friends to bother with it either, just so they don't yell at me.\n\nNow, you can read this review in a blitering fury, and write down a entire essay about how i'm wrong and you're right, and you don't need to tell me that. This is MY opinion, and yours is yours. I'm sure you loved it, I really am. but because I can't read minds, i dont really know what other people were expecting, so i wrote this review as if i was talking to a past me. Not you, I dont know you, I don't even know that many people, and out of the few people i know, there are some that would love it. Yet, I can't write a review for them, I'm writing one for me.

Whilst it may fell to start off slow and somewhat empty as you reverse the lovely open world forest, you soon forget about the cross-map hikes as you are too interested in the quickly growing story line.\n\nThe controls took me a while to grasp but made sense quickly afterwards. I decided to play this on a game pad as it feels to have a more casual play style to it.\n\nI don't want to say too much about the story as it is one of the games you need to play yourself. So don't watch any of the game play on YouTube if you are even considering this game.\n\nWhilst I haven’t finished the story and have only played 85 minutes at the time of this review. That was a solid 85 minutes spent playing the game. 85 I thoroughly enjoyed and only stopped As school work just about took priority for me.\n\nI think that's all I have to say. This is a game that is well worth the £14.99 price tag on steam, maybe even under priced for the amount of amply and enjoyment I have gotten from. If any of the development team see this. Well done. This is an amazing game and you have a real talent for story telling and game development. I will definitely be following this studio for more games in the future as this game somewhat got me back into PC gaming.\n\nThis review may seem a bit bit but this game deserves all the praise it can get.

The closest emotional involvement I can compare to was in The Last of Us, but in Firewatch it's a much more grown up experience.\n\nI am of a similar age to the characters in the game so perhaps this is why it resonated with me , but I think all gamers will appreciate the solid story telling in this game.\n\nOn top of that the game is very pretty. It has a stylised  art direction but it works so well, and as the game progresses the colours change along with the darkening story line.\n\nAll in all this is a great gaming experimented and the only downside is that it is a little short, completed in 4 hours, but it feels ok for it to be that short.\n\nThere is also a great thing involving photographs which I will let you discover on your own!\n\nI can't recommend   this enough!\n\n9 out of 10\n\n","February 11","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In short its a great game. Loved it all the way through and always had my attention. It even actually had me say "my god" out loud and to be honest only 1 other game made me do that ever.\nOn the down side its is only about 4 hours long and I really do wish it was longer. I took my time and even listned to the conversations the two characters had between one another. The ending either good or bad depending on your personal preference.\n\nThe ending to me did seem rushed but it does have a good intention to it. unfortunatly it shows what type of person Delilah truely is even though it does hint it from the papers you find on her as one of her traits. There was some little plot holes left but the one that does bother me is why Delilah never really want to meet Henry at the end I know she says she doesnt want to sit next to him thinking about the dead child but I dont know to me thats more like a excuse. I just think it was her being selfish but again it never really does go into it more.\n\nI do recommend this game if your looking for a different type of experience when it comes to video games. Again I love this game and no I dont plan to refund if I can. If I pay $20+ for a 2 hour movie than why not pay $20 for a game that is 4 hours long?

Similar to Life Is Strange, this game has a certain aesthetic to it that almost made it a must buy for me from the graphics alone.\n\nA game is ofcourse more than graphics alone. In my opinion, this game is a must buy if you enjoy story driven games that lean towards the 'walking simulator' catergory, because that's what it does, and it does so wonderfully. Sure, the game isn't the longest, it took me a little more 3 hours to complete, but I feel like that is the perfect amount of time to tell the story in and make the player experience what the gameworld has to offer. To explain this a little more, some games feel a little 'forced' in the sense that they make you do certain things that don't add anything to the game experience itself (see Fallout 4: "Another settlement needs our help!"). This game absolutely does not do that and that what makes it the perfect length for me. They also absolutely nailed the atmosphere in the game: it did make me feel certain things at certain times which made the game great for me. (I can't really elaborate without spoiling things)\n\nHowever, there are 2 things I'd critisize the game for, and it seems like I'm not the only one in feeling that.\n\nFirst of, it doesn't really have any replayability, UNLESS you replay it for the visuals/dialog alone, to try and see if you've missed something your first time around. Other than that the story is pretty much what the game is based around and I don't think it will have the same inpact the second time playing it.\n\nThe second thing is the price point. I don't necessarily feel like the game is too expensive for what it delivered to me, but I can definitely see why you would feel otherwise. The ~€20 price point might be a little high for some people for the game it gives you and in that case I'd recommend you to wait for a sale.\n\n\nOverall though, I loved this game and I would definitely recommend it simply for the game it is.","February 9","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is not a great videogame, this is simple the most wonderful and beautifully scripted adventure that I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Right of the bat you are pulled into this story between a boy and girl who move into a relationship together with all the great times and bad times along the way. Right when you finally get set into the firelodge in Wyoming, I was immediately thinking "no way I'll be able to explore this whole forest" but I was wrong. At anytime in the game you can explore the entire forest and find all the treasures (be it big or small) or the little easter eggs you find from time to time. The game does an excellent job of guiding the player to each area one by one as you slowly progress through the excellent story that is thanks to large part of the brillant dialognue between the player and Delilah; your "supervisor" as you live in the forest.\nAll in all the game is short, but every moment I spent exploring the forests and caves of Firewatch I was compelled to keep going and turn on my radio just for any moment of dialognue between the two main characters.\nA short, but pleasantly sweet adventure that I would love to visit again and again.","February 26","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I want to make that clear. 4.5 hours of my logged time is me accidentally leaving it on because I was going to be late to work if I didn't leave. But this game is simple, and it doesn't try to be more than simple. It plays with our expectations, our way of looking at the world and games and the idea of conspiracies.\n\nBut most of all it teaches you about yourself. Not many people will look at Henry and understand exactly what is happening to him, that I know. But it show's the player how they would handle the situation. It's hard not to give spoilers, but I'll be damned if I do, so just know that you'll get a better sense of yourself by the end. Are you willing to please other's at your own expense, or do you need your way even if it makes them uncomfortable?\n\nThis game is beautiful. This game is funny. This game is... depressing. It's very real in certain senses, and I think some are taking their unease at the games ending a bit too far and too personal. The reality of escapism manifested as a game, is what I might call it.\n\nWho knows, maybe I'm an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

I only learned about it the day before its release. I went in blind with no expectations.\n\nFirewatch is a game for people who like heavy narrative and dialogue - i.e. a story, and a very sad one at that. If you don't like stories, and especially if you don't like sad stories, don't play Firewatch. I happen to love sad stories, which is why I loved this game.\n\nYou're not going to find any sort of intensive (or even remotely challenging) gameplay here. This game is strictly a guided narrative; the gameplay is secondary, something to keep you active while you engage with the story. However, I remained deeply emotionally invested throughout the entire experience. The game is visually stunning, and though the aesthetic is slightly cartoonish, I never once felt as though my sense of realism or immersion was broken. But the real engagement is 100% as a result of the absolutely fantastic voice acting. I felt so invested in the characters, I think more than I have been in any other game I've played.\n\nSome cons are the runtime and the pricetag. Just shy of $20 is too much for a game that takes less than 4 hours to beat. Granted, I found those 4 hours to be riveting, but I think my experience would have been more (soul-crushingly) fulfilling if I had paid $10 for this game. Also, there is no incentive for replayability - play through the storyline once, and you've seen everything the game has to offer.\n\nA lot of people are complaining about the ending (don't worry, no spoilers). I was upset with it at first, too, but then I sat a while and thought about it, and realized that the ending is what makes this game so brilliant. I urge those who are upset with the ending to really spend some time being introspective.\n\nThis game is wonderfully written; a short story personified. A model for narrative realism in video games.\n\nScore: 8.5/10","February 11","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Right off the bat you are introduced to Delilah your ''Boss'' she is the Character that you are alongside throughout the entire game(Via Radio Conversations). As the days progress the relationship between them builds. Then roughly half way through the game after a fire starts to build in the forest you find out that your conversations with Delilah have been recorded. Paranoia develope in both characters until you eventually find out who was behind the recordings. At the end of the game you take a Rail Car over to Delilahs watch tower where you await to be picked up by helicopter. Delilah gets picked up before you and when you arive inside the watch tower you call her the last conversation of the game happens Delilah decides to go back to her home and you decide to go back home and see your ill wife. You hop in the helicopter and then the credits roll.\n\nOverall the story was very well written and i felt the connection between both characters as the story developed. I havent seen a game like this in a long time and i hope other creators see this as inspiration for their game!\n\nPros:\n-Outstanding Animations, Dialogue, Effects\n-Runs well in 99.99% of the map\n-Beautifully written story\n-Perfect timing of the music when events occur\n-Amazing Character development\n-Great voice acting\n\nCons:\n-Only 3-4 HOURS of gameplay for a 20 dollar Title! (This is the main reason why this game gets its hate)\n-The ending fell short of its leading up Which left a lot of people dissapointed\n-Barely any replay ability :/\n\nOverall: For the experience I would definitely buy this game.

The subtle nature of it all, there are peaks and valleys, but through all of it the story is really about the relationship being formed between the two characters.\n\nIm not going to spoil anything here, but the high points in terms of excitement are def around the 3/4s way through, which leads to a resolution that is human, and believable. It reminds me of a movie in that regard, a good movie that doesnt have to end with an explosion, just open ended with enough information to leave you wondering and contemplate the characters.\n\nLots of people have talked about the choices you make not having a bearing on the outcome, but those outcomes happen mostly in real time. Its about how you choose to communicate, and it changes the ebb and flow of the game.\n\nYa know sometimes I love action, sometimes I want silly fun, but sometimes I want to sink my head into something that makes me think, or, just plants me in the environment and atmosphere of a tale; it doesnt necessarily need a beginning middle and end, I dont need the Heros Journey all over again, I just want to immerse myself. Thats what this game was to me.\n\nI got vibes of the movie Fargo for some reason, mainly in the back and forth dialogue I think, and the whole escalating mystery. The resolution too, with how it came back down to earth, reminded me of that sort of writing. One that doesnt simply pander to an audience that needs stimulation every thirty seconds.\n\nI sat down at midnight last night, and started playing this game after my friend told me how great it was, we have similar taste. I had expected to go to sleep around an hour later, and was still awake at five in the morning unable to leave the story unresolved.\nMy overall playtime was five hours, none of that felt drawn out, and I didnt particularly stop to smell the roses as I was so drawn into the story. I see most people quoting 2-3hrs, and personally dont know how they did it.\n\nOverall, sure this game isnt going to be for everyone, just like there are plenty of games that arent to my tastes. To the people this does appeal to though, its something to cherish because we really dont get enough of this sort of story in games.\n\nThank you devs, for your time, your story, for taking that risk.","February 13","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

In the sense that I really enjoyed learning about the characters (who are incredibly well written, I might add) and just progressing through the story.\n\nIs it worth $20? Maaaaaybe not for everyone. I love story-driven games, so I think it was worth it, but you might not.\n\nHowever,\nThat's not to say the game wasn't good, it was amazing. After about 15 minutes of playing I was fully immersed in the story and quickly lost track of time. The story here is amazing. The environments are done in an extremely beautiful art style that suck you into the world and make you want to stay. But the gameplay is very limited. You click to interact with things, but that's about all you can do.\n\nThe story is more or less what you make of it. If you like speedrunning through games just to get the required bits, you'll miss so much. I highly suggest you explore everything you can to get as much detail as possible about the world. That's where I found a good chunk of the fun in this game.\n\nPros:\n-Great story\n-Awesome visuals\n-Believeable characters\n-Great soundtrack\n-Large amount of detail\n\n\nCons:\n-Limited Gameplay\n-Some minor graphical bugs, and rare but noticable frame drops (I have an i7-4790K and a GTX 980, for reference)\n-Relatively low replayability\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nAt its current price, it's a maybe. If you really really like story-driven games like me, then I'd say $20 is a very fair price.

If you have ever been hiking before out in Colorado, Michigan, Wyoming, or any of those states it will bring back memories for sure.\n\nAs for the story, I have only played through the intro and the first day so far. Basically you get to pick a bunch of choices in the beginning and I assume they have an impact later in the story although I have not got that far yet. The voice acting is really good and the choices you get to pick in the dialogue have a very "Fallout 3 GECK Test" type feel. Some are serious, and some are funny/rude.

I just felt like there could have been more to the story, the graphics are quite beautiful though. Also the game feels a little clunky as far as mobility/movement and theres a couple small bugs but not many and i'm sure they will be ironed out shortly.","February 9","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

E3, maybe? Yes. E3. I didn't think much of it, I didn't get hype, I barely remember thinking that the visual style was nice and the story seemed appealing and mysterious. Now, I got reminded of the game's existence today by funkE who was streaming it earlier today. I watched the stream a bit and immidiately closed it. I don't want to see the game, I want to  play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. Now.  And it's what I did! Saw the price, sure it's low and obviously it's not going to be a 10+ hour game, which is considered a con towards the game by some people, but let's not get there yet. I buy it, install it and start playing. One sitting later, I finish the game.\n\nWas it great? Yes. The prime asset of any adventure-type game is that the journey is the most important aspect. Not the end. Despite the end coming faster than expected, Firewatch delivered what I consider an amazing and inspiring journey. Oh, gotta keep this spoiler free ... Almost slipped there! Anyhow, I don't want to  write a book  about this game, so let's just say that for it's faily low price (from my standards), the emotions and the beauty of it all really makes it worth it. All in all, alas, I thoroughly recommend Firewatch.\n\nOh! Almost forgot. The only thing I really want about this game is continuity, like DLC. Maybe that's just me and the game is bound to be shrouded in mystery (what I mean by that is what happens after the game ends.) You really get attached (with a tight  rope , really) to the characters, heck, even Delilah, who, mild spoiler, is never seen throughout the adventure.\n\nTL;DR\n\nGood game. Worth buying. Definitely looking out for more about this game in the future.\n\nThank you for the experience!","February 9","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is an amazing game and the story is brilliant. There is no action and no monsters but the story is one of the most interesting stories I have ever played. I recommend this game to everyone and I hope this game grows in popularity because it definitely deserves it!\n\n9/10 Brilliant Game but can be classed as a short game with it providing around 5 hours of gameplay","February 9","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's not that it's difficult, but rather that there is so much content within it that those who find themselves caught up in the atmosphere in the game can choose to stay. Overall this game will make you feel and experience things that I don't even think a movie or novel could make you feel. But if you are mainly a COD fan than maybe this game isn't for you. Or maybe it is make up ur own mind and stop reading reviews.\n\nAlot of the negative reviews comment on the ending of this game saying basically "it wasn't what they wanted". They can dance around that and say the game hyped itself up, or that it lead me to believe, but for those who can appreciate it, Firewatchs story is deep and makes you feel like you are actually in the shoes of your main character. It will be sad, it will be happy. It will make you laugh, and question things, get mad even. There won't be achievements thrown at you for picking up every rock or beer can, which is another critic people are making, claiming that once you play it through once you have seen it all. But so many people that have played it have replayed it just because they didn't know they missed something.\n\nAnd with so much in the game to explore and find I am looking forward to my next more in depth and slower playthrough.\n\n10/10","February 17","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Its a masterpiece when looked at from a game story perspective and i would personally take a 6 hour game that delivers in all most all aspects over a lets say 11 hour dull and boring COD campain for 20 dollars.\n\nThat being said this game is not for everyone. There is only one thing you must ask yourself before buying this.\nDo i enjoy story focused games with little to no real gameplay (Like games from telltale)?\nIf you do then this game has everything you could ask for from a game story... except mayby the ending.\nIt didn't suck but it was just kinda "disappointing"...
