If you can get past the parser interface (you'll have to actually type with correct spelling with the approved verbs) this version seems to have fixed some of the timing issues (particularly the 'normal is timestop') in previous DosBox versions. It's fairly historically accurate, it's more than entertaining for a really old game, and for an old Sierra fan like myself, it was an instabuy.\n\nThe sound does seem to lag the game just a bit, which is odd.\n\n9/10","August 11, 2014","true","10.1"," 63 of 65 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","63","65","0","1"

Part of it is the primitive mechanics.  It’s not like today’s point and click game where you click on a location and the character will move there.  You have to use your arrow keys to direct every step of the movement.  You also have to instruct the character what to do.  Encountering another character will not automatically trigger conversation.  You have to tell your character to ‘talk’ by typing this in.  If you don’t type in the correct series of words, this will also halt your progress.  And last but not least, there is potential to fall into a big hole in this game.  Let’s say you did not pick up a certain something on level one, well if you don’t have it at level 10, you can forget finishing this game …   Still, there is a lot of charm to this game with its graphics and story plot.  I recommend it on sale.  I would also like to play the updated anniversary edition.","December 17, 2014","true","6.6"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

Games such as Gold Rush! really put your mind to the test since you actually have no idea what to do once you're in the game. There are no pointers, almost no hints and there are timed events that you are not even aware of!\n\nPlay this game and have a taste of how games were back in the eighties!","June 23, 2015","true","4.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

Save often friends, you may live or you may die, but at least you can retry ;).  Gold Rush had to be one of the most entertaining games I played, I was a history buff and getting to somewhat live it in this game made it a true blast, and that is only part of the fun.  You also had to figure out what to say and how to say it correctly to get items, or get the correct information, or not die from scurvy going around the cape!  Everyone shoudl play this if nothing but for the history of adventure games.

It's one of the lesser-known Sierra games, and doesn't have a HUGE amount of puzzles or variability to it (despite the "three routes" claim).  It might take you just a couple of hours to grind through it all.

Classic is based on the true story of a strong rounded character named St. Alfonzo and his trek to a California territory full of gold named, "San Francisco". Gold Rush! Classic reminds me of the old school shoot 'em up genre blended with a smooth arcade old-school feeling. The classic and simplistic gameplay reminds me about Galaga. I friggin' love Galaga and wish it was on Steam, but Gold Rush! Classic will have to do. Until then, I'm off to St. Alfonzo's pancake breakfast.","December 24, 2014","true","1.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","0"

Designed on Sierra's AGI platform, players familiar with the original King's Quest, Space Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry games from the 80s will feel right at home.  The game offers replayability, as there are three different paths from Brooklyn to Sacramento, each with its own unique challenges and puzzles to overcome.  The designers also painstakingly went to great lengths to include various points of historical detail about The United States as it was being formed, and the sacrifices made and hardships endured by those who risked the journey across... granted, it's a work of pure fiction, but it paints a believable picture, at least believable enough for an 80s adventure game to be immersive.\n\nWell worth a play for the price.","March 15","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Travel from New York to California as Jerrod Wilson during the Great Gold Rush of 1849 & strike it rich while visiting 3 different locations along the way but each route has its dangers since Sierra Adventure Games are known for is that fact that you can die in adventure games if you're careless with your actions or via random deaths.\n\nDon't take TOO LONG to leave NY In-Game, otherwise passages to California increase in price since the game is timed.","May 29","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
