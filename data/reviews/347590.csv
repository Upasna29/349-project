This one kinda reminds me of 4 Elements because you match by clicking, holding down the mouse button, and dragging it through all the gems of the same color that are by each other.  There are occasional hidden object puzzles where you have to find little pieces of an object that are scattered throughout a scene.\n\nThere is also some town building.  You get gold after each match 3 level and use it to buy buildings.  There is a choice of 3 different types of buildings with increasing cost.  I don't know what that's all about yet.  So far I've just been choosing the cheapest buildings.  For instance, first you build a house and they give you 3 options of housing.  The more expensive ones have more decoration.  I don't know if they do anything else.\n\nAnd of course there are power ups in the match 3 levels.  There's a lightning icon that will destroy all the gems and things in a line, sometimes a straight line and sometimes diagonal.  There's rope and stone blocks that need to be destroyed before more gems can fall.  There's a wing icon that reveals hidden parts of the board.  Gems and treasure chests that give you more gold!\n\nI will update as I play more.","March 14, 2015","true","25.7"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","4"

As casual as casual can be. In addition to ripping off many of those casual game staples like hidden objects and match-3, it also offers many interesting ideas to these genres, and has fine level design. The story and setting is very cliché but it can also be endearing. I appreciate the good soundtrack and visuals. Has a few flaws such as levels getting too long for casual gaming, the city builder being just a non-interactive façade, and, I can't believe I'm going to say this: I'd have liked to get more hidden object scenes... Sorry, I'll just be on my way.","December 8, 2015","true","17.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","2"

The basic gameplay (make trails of 3+ matching tokens to clear them) is entertaining and the minigames like the city building and hidden object screens, while slight, are nice diversions.  But when the level I'm working on completely reconfigures itself, undoing all the work I've done, for the FOURTH time, I got tired of it.  And that was around Sequence 4, of 8.  And then there are the obnoxious design choices like the coins - which you collect to make buildings. Fine and good, except some of the level types that include coins don't actually get counted. There are reasons, but not good enough to justify it.  When levels in a casual game can take 10-15 minutes to complete, and working to get the coins is wasted effort, it makes the game too frustrating to recommend. Casual players may like it for a while, but if you're like me and want to get to the end, you'll be tearing your hair out in frustration.","July 13, 2015","false","13.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

You play The Builder who saves Athens from volcanoes and others that try to ruin it.\n\nPros:\n+Very beautiful texture, artwork, and soundtrack.\n+You get Both timed and nontimed mode. This is nice because I can up or down the difficulty on my choosing. It gives the player a sense of control.\n+The gameplay is pretty fun and the different gods having a powerup(to help clear the board) is a nice bonus.\n+Smooth FPS\n+It changes the gameplay occasionally to keep it from being monotonous.\n\nCons:\n- My only complaint about this game was the 3.99 price. I would've gladly handed over 5 bucks because the designers deserve it.\n\nOverall:\nA well polished game that I can easily pick up and drop. There's no rush and nothing that causes me stress. I would buy this if you into the Match 3 Realm. :)","March 29, 2015","true","3.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I actually really enjoyed this for a few reasons, one being that the board is a hex-grid, and not the standard square, leading to more abilities to match, as well as the fact that it also has puzzle-like maps where the goal is to figure out how to get some objects off the board with abilities.\n\nQuite good! Would highly recommend if you like casual titles.","April 16, 2015","true","14.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

For some reason there are hidden object parts in the game now and then which I don't think really belong here also do the quasi building aspects don't seem to have a purpose besides advancing the game. The matching part is the main thing and they do break it up with different gimmicks and types of stuff. It's enjoyable for a little while, easy to understand rules and interface.","June 25, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The games, themselves, are just fine.  The story wrapper they use to try to link the games into some more meaningful whole (restoring Athens and then building a palace) could be done away with entirely.  But, that doesn't detract from the actual gameplay.  Also, just for completeness, you should know that the M3s have Fractured Object Games (FROGs) and Move Limited Match 3 (MLM3) games interspersed throughout them.  I'm not a fan of FROGs, but they're only about one every "level" of the main game (there are 8 levels of 13 games (I believe)).  The MLM3s are half of the "bonus" "Build your Palace" portion.\n\nThe game does have some issues, though.  First, it's an old game and doesn't limit its frame rate.  When I first started it, I noticed my fans ramping up on my graphics card.  When I checked the frame rate, it was over a thousand.  So, I had to install RivaTuner and set up a frame rate limit (60 fps) for the game.  Second, the story around the actual games is really just tacked on and useless.  I'd have been happier with a grid showing games available and games done just like they did in the "bonus" portion where you build your palace.  And, finally, the palace you build in that "bonus" portion is a mess:  it's ugly, badly designed, and badly drawn.  But, again, it's just a wrapper around the actual games.\n\nBut, overall, I got about 30 hours of good play (24 hours in the main game, 6 hours in the "bonus" game) out of this $3.99 (which I got in a bundle, so the cost was utterly trivial).  If you like M3s, then I recommend this game.  Good value for the money.","July 2, 2015","true","30.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's not wildly innovative, but it's solid, well-made casual fun for those who like the match-3 style, but want something a little bit differenct from the standard match-3 gameplay.\n\nThe game is padded out with a few scenes of city-building and hidden objects.  These scenes are fluff, add nothing, and should be ignored, but they can usually be dispensed with quickly, so they don't detract too much.  the writing (in English at least) is somewhat clumsy, but you aren't really playing this for the story; you're playing for the actual tile-matching levels, and those are quite satisfying, if not particularly challenging.","October 30, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not enough to match shapes with each other, you have to do legitimate problem solving.

I had no problem running this on my HP Stream which runs on a Celeron processor on 2GB of RAM. And when I output this on a TV through HDMI, it had no problem with the higher resolution, working like a charm. Though this game doesn't officially support it, I found the Steam Controller much more satisfying to use than my laptop trackpad.\n\nThe hidden object of the game wasn't as satisfying as the puzzling. Thankfully, there's much much more puzzling than hidden object.\n\nFinally, this is a great game to play with a toddler. My 2-year-old daughter loved watch the shapes match with each other, along with the explosions.
