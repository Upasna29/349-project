It has its fun moments, and other times it gets a little tedious, but both come in equal measures. I'm only recommending this game on the basis that it only costs $5 and is a decent way to pass some time, So, this game is worth the price, but you'd probably be better off spending tthat $5 elsewhere.","February 20, 2014","true","26.4"," 231 of 269 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","231","269","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kratoscrux/recommended/16730/","kratoscrux","Fasio_Vita","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kratoscrux/","990 products in account","Only buy this game if it's 75 cents or less.\n\nLegendary has it's upsides, the most notable being the premise of the game. Griphons and other mythological creatures invading the modern world is the selling point of this game, and it ends there. Literally everything else about the game is bad or poorly imagined.\n\nFirst off, this game is broken. Absolutely, fundamentally broken. You literally can not beat this game if you just install it and play it. Right before the final level, there is a game-breaking glitch that causes you to fall through the floor. It is impossible to complete the game. There are a few files you can change to fix this, but the fact that this is included in the game shows how little the developers care, and how poorly the game was ported to PC.\n\nThe gameplay is boring and repetative. There are about 3 enemy types you will regularly be fighting throughout the game, most of which are just cannon fodder. A plus gameplay wise is that you get health by absorbing enemy souls, and I find this to be the only redeeming quality of this game in a world of regenerating health shooters.\n\nThe environments and character design are actually pretty decent. AI teammates will occasionally warp through walls, and you can stand inside of them as well. Friendly character clipping wasn't taken into account at all. The animations for most characters are done nicely, but some enemies have poor animation cycles when waiting for a cutscene event.\n\nCutscenes in this game aren't impressive in the slightest. Every time you beat a major story plot point, you are given a slideshow of images and text that is read aloud. The most dissapointing part of the game is at the very end. After you fix the glitch and get to the final level, you complete 3 simple tasks and are given a wall of text. I have never been so dissapointed with an ending since watching Evangelion.\n\nMy final verdict is to get it on sale. As a game, it isn't so bad that it should be avoided, but you should definitely not pay full price for it. This game is common in indie bundles and I've seen it go as low as $0.74 (£0.59) on Steam.","April 14, 2014","false","6.5"," 147 of 192 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","147","192","0","3"

Since steam doesn't give me a neutral option I will put to not recommend. My reasoning behind this is because for the most part the game has a lot of technical problems and one huge game breaking bug that happened in an elevator that leads to the final battle of the game, with all these issues I can't bring myself to recommend this even if I enjoyed it. One issue I had was the controls, the way your character moves is very stiff, he jumps like 2 inches off the ground which is annoying when there are some vital points in the game where you need the ability to jump a little, but when you sprint he's all over the place. Another technical issue is the shooting, they have a weird delay from when you shoot the gun to when its supposed to register on the enemy, this makes shooting moving targets more difficult, but it seems to only occur when you shoot human enemies. There are a few more but those are the most important ones to know about, the big elevator glitch I pointed out earlier (which would drop me through the floor of the elevator when it started to move ending up in me falling forever or being stuck below the level) took me a while to find a fix for, some people said to mess around in the ini files, some people said to look at an angle, some said to use FRAPS to limit the fps of the game, so what fixed it was a combo of everything. Multiplayer for me at least was out of the question based the problems with the single player and the fact that you didn't a different account just to play it.\n\nBut not all is bad with this game, I like the story of fighting a bunch of mythical creatures who were let out because the character you play as was hired/tricked to open Pandora's Box, and the whole game nobody really busts his balls over it, they just accept that he did it and tries to fix it. The creatures are amazing, each one brings their own challanges, Minotaurs are fast, strong, and take awhile to kill while Nari's are more stealthy, come in packs, and are invicible untill they get ready to attack. I was surprised by some of the great face animations from the characters while in game (not cutscenes) reminded me a lot of BioShock Infinite. Some people complain about the graphics but to me they were pretty good especially for the time this came out. The game was very action packed, you are constantly going against something that surprises you and keeps you on your toes, watching massives golems destory the city while griffons fly over head is just one of the wonderful sights of the environment around you will your fighting. I do wish there were more enemies just to bring more diversity and a longer single player experience.\n\nThis is a decent game that I feel is haunted by a lot of technical issues, I would recommend it with a warning but in this case I don't think most people would enjoy this as much as me, but if you can get it for cheap you have nothing to lose, give it a shot.","February 13, 2014","false","6.6"," 104 of 133 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","104","133","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198019205444/recommended/16730/","76561198019205444","sitebender","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198019205444/","1543 products in account","Legendary is a horror action first person shooter in the fashion of Duke Nukem Forever and Half-Life 2. Horror as in blood and gory, but not scary, its action first. You have unlocked Pandora's Box, and you'll have to fight mythological creatures to present day New York City and London. You'll fight flying griffins, charging minotaurs, sneaky werewolves, and yes someone released the Kraken. The thing that stands out about the game are the fights. Not just you fighting the enemies, but your allies fighting a hostile faction and enemies attacking everything living. It all adds to a level of strategy. Do you shoot open the lock to a werewolf's cage and have it attack your enemies? Do you flank your enemies while your allies keep them occupied or throw a grenade? One enemy can attack another and light it on fire. Combat isn't scripted. Your allies will die and that's okay. You can leave them, you're not chained to them, but they do help you.\n\nThe game has brief cut scenes, THAT ARE NOT SKIPABLE. Some of the cut scenes are like an advanced slide show with beautiful art and voice overs. I'd rather see that when interluding between things. There is humor here and there. About once every two hours without being in your face. The game will tell you where to go, what to do with voice overs, because that's what first person shooters do. Thankfully this one says use the rocket launcher against that griffin instead of hold that button, to lock on the griffin, then press that button to fire the rocket. So it keeps me in game. What doesn't keep me in game is the loading screen when I died. I died a lot on medium difficulty when it came to the bosses. I'd say more than other similar first person shooters. There is no easy health. No health kits, no regenerating health at least on medium difficulty. Things will crush you, such as the Kraken's giant purple tentacles. You need to stay sharp and look up.\n\nWhen you start the game, you're given incredible hand powers to do three things. You can absorb what I'll call "souls" from dead creatures. Absorbing souls takes time and you need to hold down the button, but if there are 3 souls in 1 area it only needs to be done once to absorb all souls. With these souls you can either hold the same hand button to heal yourself or double press it to send out a wave that stuns enemies. Other than that the weapons are pretty basic, you have a pistol (which I never used), shotgun, machine gun, assault rifle, heavy machine gun, flame thrower for giant swarming blood ticks and rocket launcher. Every weapon has 'iron sights.' The rocket launcher will lock on a target, no matter where they move, the rocket will follow. The hidden gem here is the fire axe. With it you can break the arms of werewolves so they can't attack you. However, it makes a glitchy sort of dangling arm since its broken, not severed. You also have detonation grenades and molotov cocktails that start enemies on fire. With all that said, you can carry two guns at a time, in addition to both kinds of throwables and your fire axe.\n\nThis is more of a spectacle first person shooter. A towering golem made of junk will walk through Times Square, Big Ben will get obliterated. What there won't be is any sort of exploration. This isn't Quake or Doom. Legendary only has winding maps with short deviations. Things like shoot this object to open a path and hold a button to flip a switch. There are challenges like hold this point for X amount of time. Kill werewolves and absorb their souls and use that to charge EMPs or generators. Kill the giant bosses. Rocket kill griffins. Its all engaging fun, even if you won't get lost. The game even has a waypoint button to see where to go, but I never use it.\n\nThe enemies each feel unique. Drakes will pop out of fire, roll around and then either spit lava balls from a distance or spew massive amounts of fire like a dragon. You can use water to extinguish them. Werewolves feel like the most typical creature. They will climb up walls to attack from different angles. They have a standard melee, but they'll also throw objects like barrels and stones. If you attack their head, they'll block and they'll jump around. Once they're down you need to behead them or they'll come back. The hairless werewolves are easy enough, but the hairy ones are tougher. The navi are little ghost sprite imp things. In their ghost form you can't hurt them, but they will inhabit objects to attack. Either they'll throw objects or posses vending machines that will shoot cans at you. Minataurs and Griffins will smash an entire area to kill things. They'll go through pillars, walls, bookshelves and anything else. You are not safe. They will always find and kill. The only difference between them is one flies and screams, the other gets stunned after charging. Other than that, the main non boss creature is a tentacle. Green tentacles will attack from water and try to pull you to your instant death. Kill it before you die. If that wasn't enough there are typical soldiers to fight, just as you have your allies. They shoot guns and throw grenades your way when you stay out of sight. Its easy enough to headshot them if you're not using a shotgun. Their aim is too good if you're not hiding behind something. Plus since you don't get to take their soul when they're dead, there's no health from them either. There are cool armored flame throwing soldiers. It adds nice tension seeing them just walk at you making a wall of flame.\n\nA nice twist to the game is there are also creature controllers. You can use your soul energy to temporarily charge it and the creatures won't come after you. The game will respawn creatures at times (but not soldiers). Even if you've killed 100 werewolves in the same spot. If you stand there, more werewolves will come. So you need to move on. It'll only waste your ammo, but you have an excessive amount of it.\n\nI feel like the game has good intelligence. Soldiers will move back into cover when I flank them. Werewolves will flank to attack, even if some run straight up to you. However, the game's maps don't make good use of that intelligence until later maps. Most maps are just straight forward with cover and no flanking opportunity. Later maps have flank opportunities while your allies occupy enemies.\n\nThe game looks great and there are a variety of atmospheric environments. New York City streets with cars everywhere, ancient ruins, a graveyard, sewers, subways and parliament libraries. but it feels like it has a fog or a haze over it. Even bright green things have a layer of gray. Maybe its gamma correction? Sometimes objects and characters have a white glowing hue. The fire and water look great. Enemies catch fire and dynamically light the area if not spread the fire. Water is everywhere in the game. You'll be trudging through sewers, walls will have water slicking down them and of course broken pipes. You can't run or jump while in water, although there was one time where I felt like I could. Maybe the water wasn't deep enough. Speaking of jump, its the most hilariously pathetic jump I've experienced. Yet while holding run and jump suddenly you shoot forward. I blame the Unreal engine. Even with all the water, you won't be swimming or anything other than walking and shooting.\n\nOverall, the game has silly glitches. Dead werewolves get stuck in the ground. Bullets can hit invisible walls when on staircases. Soldiers have incredible aim. Health is tough to come by. Ammo is too plentiful. I never ran out unless it was rockets. No saving, just check pointing. People in the forum and elsewhere complain about game breaking glitches, but I never ran into any. The graphics look foggy yet great. The cut scenes are unskipable. It has an air of AAA yet not AAA. Yet after all that, I still enjoy the game because of its enemies and their interactions. The game has been on sale for 50 cents before. Take a chance. Even if its to say LOLz Call of Duty with mythology.","November 23, 2014","true","9.4"," 83 of 109 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","83","109","10","2"

I think it's a good thing this game got so much bad press, because you will go into it expecting crap, and you will be surprised by how not crap it is. Actually, you'll probably be amazed at all the scripted events and chaos and enemies lurking about. A griffon causing havoc, breaking into buildings and nearly taking your head off, another griffon flying through a cathedral... truly... this is some fantastic stuff for a game released in 2008. And it looks good too.\n\nAlso, Legendary touches upon a story that, when you see Pandora's Box as a symbol for genetic splicing, is all too realistic and believable. I think this scares the haters and they don't want to admit it, so while in fear they just hate.\n\nFor FPS games, this is pretty good. Granted, it's not the most engaging, but if you play the game with the mind that that awesome fireman's axe is your primary weapon and what you use for most of the game, believe me, this game all of a sudden becomes very engaging and worthwhile. The guns are pretty good, but there's something lacking in engaging enemies with them, but that axe... it's all about that axe and hunting werewolves with it. A good challenge is to face the first Minotaur with the axe. Grenades and molotovs are very welcome to use, but always weild that axe.\n\nThe enemies, not including the humans, are also really well done. The Nari are very well scripted and a real treat to witness and axe to death. They go around lifting things and throwing them at you. They appear in front of your face and do a little mockery dance. They lift soda machines and cause the soda cans to fly out at you. The Nari truly make this game really enjoyable. Of course, they are an enemy, but a very unique enemy. It's obvious a lot of love went into creating them.\n\nAlso, there's that game-breaking bug at the end, which solutions have been made available by players.\n\nIf this game ever got achievements, it would only need one. I challenge all you players to earn it:\n\n\nLegendary - Beat the game weilding the fireman's axe for at least 80% of the game\n\n\nThis is how you make a decent game more fun.

For once we get a fresh take on battling monsters, instead of taking place in the far flung fantasy filled past of wizards or knights, or in a galaxy far far away in some doom wannabe, we get a game that lets us take on mythological creatures of the past in the modern world.  This game does have bugs, its not perfect, and the controls are kind of shot.  Some strange bugs encountered was that the sun in the sky would appear through objects or when in an enclosed room or tunnel and one gamebreaking bug at the end of the game.  The game played with a keyboard and mouse is way to easy.   The controller controls arent great they skate around and the look or aim seems to often fly all over.  While normally I would hate that, this isnt a platformer where any precise jumps are required.  In a way the bad controls added to the challenge.  Somehow the floaty controls for aiming made me feel like I was there since noone would stay perfect in that situation with their aim.\n\nMultiplayer is dead since gamespy is dead, but the story is fun, many of the visuals of the blown up burned out city are great.  Def worth a playthrough and if its too easy  just exit and change the difficulty.\n\nTo pass the elevator glitch that kills you at the end of the game go to "C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Games\Legendary\PandoraGame\Config" set framerate to 30, then play until the next checkpoint exit and set it back to 300.\n\nRating:  5/10  Value:  $4.99","April 18, 2014","true","9.2"," 69 of 99 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","69","99","0","1"

Once you killed a creature of the pandora you get energy that can be used as a knockback skill or selfheal.\n- The groundskeeper tbat randomly cleaned the military base in the middle of the game although the whole world is about to collaps (he sure likes his job, i enjoyed watching him ^-^... the fact that he is in the pro says pretty much all about the rest.. doesnt it?)\n- Atmosphere of the surface (shame you get to play mostly in subway stations and others so you cant see the scenery that much... destroying world seems to be nice)\n- The cracen as Boss was quite spectacular... RELEASE THE CRACEN!  (although he was not realy hard...)\n- The first time you get to face Minotaur and Gryphon as a enemy (miniboss), the feeling of the fight actually is pretty nice. After the first one you simply nuke them with rocket launcher or getlingun and that makes it quite dull again.\n\nCons:\n- The last lvl has a BUGG where you have to change the maxframerate to 30 or you will get bugged in the elevator\n- too less monsters (you mostly fight against werewolfs... which first seem to be a nice enemy as you have to execute them, but you will soon notice that you do not need to lasthit him with a meleweapon but still simply shoot him... lame)\n- You actually fight more military men than monsters\n- The synchro is not that good (some maybe will think otherwise)\n- Whole game is based on checkpoint data which means that nothing is random in the world but actually spawns for you at the right moment... the checkpoint part also occurs for the military guys you get as support... they die about 1 or 2 minutes after you get them by default (mostly even secounds after you get them).... all... the....time..... that gets boring\n- The scoped version of the weapons is too fast and it is actually therefore easier to aim without scoping at all... (if you are playing ego shooters all the time you might think not so, but at the moment i do not play shooter games that much)\n- You can barely get out of ammo and therefore the melee weapon is just a style way to killl (most weapon spots have unlimited amount of resupply)\n- The mobs randomly spawn and sometimes they don't see you at all although you are right in front of them\n- 3-5 hours of gameplay for 7gb to download is not realy efficient.\n- Decard can actually jump like 5-10 centimeters high... that is so unrealistic and makes it quite clear where you have to go..\n- The whole world arround you dies, you actually have nothing to fear at all as you are never in a realy huge threat... lame\n...\n- probably some points i have forgotten\n\nResult:\nThis game is not realy worth to play, BUT when you see it for its saleprice of not even 1€ (0,95 or sth like that) you can pick it up.. this game is so terrible in many stages that it is actually fun to play because it is so bad.\nIt is worth the 1€ but not the 5€ it is sold\n\nProbably a 3-4 / 10\n\nIt had potential to be a good game but the potential was not used correctly so it became a quite bad but still playable (no replay value at all) game","July 7, 2014","false","5.0"," 44 of 68 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","44","68","0","0"

Aiming seems to be off center, its not uncommon to have a perfect aim of an enemy and have it tell you that you missed. The monsters are by far the best part of this game. There are a lot of different types to fight, all of which present their own unique challenge.\n\nThe movement is rather stiff, but not game breaking. Jumping can be a bit awkward, and random things can get in the way of your walking.\n\nThe AI can be a bit off at times, sometimes leaping around in a way that was obviously not intended. Enemies also seem to spawn continuously, sometimes appearing out of thin air, which can be a bit frustrating at times.\n\nYou are forced to use checkpoints to save. Some of these checkpoints are awkwardly placed, sometimes forcing you to repeat trivial areas.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is mediocre and buggy, but thanks to awesome monsters and cool visuals it still manages to provide some fun.\n\nNOT worth the full asking price. Pay that amount and you are guaranteed to end up with buyer's remorse.

For me im not the biggest fan of FPS games but this one has stole my heart and blew me away it seams BioShock inspired with your abilities also I might be a little bias cause I love my fantasy games but once you start playing you just don't want to stop!! Its very fast paced rarely ever gets a bit slow. Sometimes you get a bit lost on what your suppose to do but that's the games way of saying use your brain. The only problems I found with this game and there just some a few minor annoyances and that's the animation on something takes double the time they should and can get you killed if your not careful and the loading screen takes forever but maybe that's just me cause this game gets me where I just wana play more and more so I become impatient. The story behind the game is brilliant the more you find out the more questions you have. The combat seams fairly ok but iv seen worse and I've seen better. I recommend playing this game with headphones on the game is more breath taking that way and you forget that its only a game till you die and have to wait for the loading screen to take you back to your last checkpoint. I got this game in a BundleStars Bundle not thinking much of it but the werewolves and the BoiShock style abilities caught my eye and made me wana try it. Im VERY glad I did and who ever you are looking at this Im telling you to BUY IT NOW!! Or at least add it to your Wish List!! Its a fantastic game 9/10 Don't have a clue why this game never became one of the big titles like BioShock and GTA for example : (","December 18, 2013","true","4.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

Pros and cons:\n\n+ The story and little cinematic moments offered some enjoyable surprises, and not just of the "Ha, monster closet!  Gotcha!" variety.\n+ I liked the mechanic of absorbing energy (health) from corpses: it made the player character feel supernatural and gave you a reason to care about the carnage you're leaving behind.\n+ The setting really felt like a city torn asunder by supernatural forces on a massive scale.\n+ The different cryptid enemies like werewolves and griffins attacked with an animalistic quality that felt very different from, say, a shooter where you only shoot enemy humanoids.\n\n- The graphics aren't so much dated or low-tech as they are poorly executed.  Other contemporary games looked better.  In particular, the normal maps are cranked up to an unrealistic degree.\n- The weapons get the job done, but none of them were particularly original or tactically interesting.\n- There's little reason to re-play the game.\n\nIs it a good value?  Well, I liked it enough to play through the campaign over 7 hours, and as I write this the game is on sale for 49¢.  So that's 7¢ per hour of entertainment.  They know it's not on par with a $60 game, and the price reflects that.

He is hired by a powerful company to open a box in a museum. However, the box is pandoras box, and releases monsters from many diffrent mythologies. The mythological artifacts and creatures are slightly diffrent then the original myths, and the game lets you know about the changes.

Sadly  I wasn`t able to finish the game but I will write what I think.\n\nStory (short version..):\n\nYou stole Pandoras Box and opended it. Suddenly you got superpowers from opening the box and a lot of monsters got summoned to the earth. Like Drakes, Griffins, Ghosts, Werwolfes and stuff... A bad guy wants to controll them and you are the only one who can stop him.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe graphics are ok......For a 2008 game at least. You can sprint 10 metres than your character is breathing like he is going to die. The jump is sometimes completly broken, you cant jump over 20cm obstacles.\n\nThe weapons are nothing special, you have a pistol, small machinegun, big machinegun, assaultrifle, flamethrowers and 2 types of grendes and a rocket launcher.\n\nWhats most annoying is that sometimes you dont know how to proceed. There are endless spawning enemies, do I need to fight or to run? Sometimes you need to kill a certain amout of enemies so something happens, And sometimes you just have to kill the spawner of the enemies to proceed. If you dont do exactly what the game wants from you, you die. Jump over a wall you shouldn`t = kill. Solve a "puzzle" otherwise than planned = kill. Thats frustrating and very sad coded.\n\nBefore I just list some points that were cool on the game or sh itty I have to say  that I COULDN`T FINISH THE GAME. Because in the last level on an elevator I ALWAYS fall through the map and die. Loaded the map several times and I couldn`t fix the bug. That was the time to uninstall for me. If something serious like this doesn`t get patched you know how much the devs care about their game.\n\nPositive aspects of the game:\n+ The music was overall very awesome.\n+ The scenery was well done with all the nonstop explosions and the feeling you are really in a war between factions.\n+ The other soldiers who mostly follow you give you a feeling that you arent alone in this "war".\n+ Funny ideas like, you try to open a door but you can`t because suddenly a ghost appears and took away the handle, made me smile at least.\n+ Story is ok to understand and you know at least what you are fighting for.\n\n- KI incredible stupid and own allies completly useless.\n- Enemies are bulletsponges like hell. A centaur and griffons are able to absorb 2 minutes of nonstop gunfire which is just dumb.\n- Named allis got too less of personality that you could care about them.\n- Jumping is broken and you feel like you can`t even pass a blade of grass.\n- TOO much ammo around every corner.\n- The superpowers feel really useless. The nonstop absorbing souls to heal the own life is just more annoying than fun.\nMedipacks would have done the job I guess. Potential wasted there...\n- 9000! Wasnt able to finish the game due to a gamebreaking bug where I always fall through the ground...\n\nPeace Hexor.\n\n\n","October 6, 2014","false","5.5"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","20","34","2","2"

And how right he was! As I have found Legendary relatively mediocre I would not recommend it, but it is not a bad game, at all.\n\nLegendary is an interesting FPS. It tries to have a unique story by unleashing mythical creatures on our modern world. Minotaurs and huge werewolves stroll the streets looking for prey. And it's all because of a thief trying to steal an artifact. As there's an order behind all this you can expect to encounter human foes along the hordes of beasts. To make the gameplay a bit more interesting our protagonist has a unique power due to the use of mentioned artifact - this can be used to hurt villains but only after collecting all the energy residue left behind by monsters.\n\nThere really is not much to say about Legendary. It is a mediocre game but what it was aimed at it achieves very well. There are some nice scripted sequences and some huge boss battles. Using a rocket launcher against the Kraken in London is very entertaining; at one point you come across with a huge griffin beast in a cathedral. I say some of these monster encounters are coupled with the appropriate environment to make these scenes memorable.\n\nToo bad you complete the story in a mere 5 hours and Legendary is pretty much done for as multiplayer is not played by anyone. I'd say give it a try if you have an awful lot of spare time and a very open-minded approach to these games.","March 8, 2014","true","5.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/16730/","stumpo","Stumpokapow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/","2598 products in account","Legendary: The Box is a 5-hour linear Call of Duty style cinematic setpiece FPS. You play as a dude who is hired to open Pandora's Box by an Evil Mad Scientist who runs some sort of Private Mercenary Cult. When you do, monsters come out. The monsters including werewolves, minotaurs, and gryphons. And the Kraken. In the second level, you kill a giant trash golem that wrecks time Square. The Kraken wrecks Big Ben. In the end, you overload Pandora's Box with Cyber Energy or something and then the bad guy dies. The ending sets you up for a sequel where, like, your Cyber Energy lets you control the monsters and as it turns out the good guys were a bad evil government or something all along.\n\nThe shooting is not particularly good. Enemies are a bit spongy and don't react to being shot, except Alpha Werewolves, whose skin starts to fall off. Both types of Werewolves need to be decapitated or they will revive themselves, doing so with the axe is pretty fun the first few dozen times. Unfortunately since they're one of the game's main enemies, it gets old. Quickly. AI is pretty weak. Guns: Assault Rifle, Machine Gun, Rocket Launcher, Shotgun, Pistol, end-of-game Flamethrower, axe. You can carry two at once. The boss fights all have unlimited ammo rocket supplies near them. Hmm.\n\nThere are no real branching paths, even areas that should be open have debris blocking your way so you're funneled through the linear intended path. You go through sewers. It hits all the clichés. Occasionally you stop to push a switch or turn a valve or fight waves of enemies until the game decides to let you go on. There are data diaries you can pick up. They have riveting anonymous text like "We're going to have to take a run for it the monsters are everywhere". The PC version does not have achievements and there is no in-game incentive to find the diaries. I stopped reading them after a level or two.\n\nThe game would have taken me less than 5 hours, but the checkpointing is pretty poor so expect to repeat long walking segments when you manage to get yourself killed at the end. I also ran into a 100% guaranteed bug just before the last checkpoint of the game that causes you to fall through the level geometry. To solve it you need to edit an INI to either bind a noclip to some control or to cap the framerate of the game at 30. This did not endear me to the game. It is well documented on Steam discussion forums.\n\nOne of the more positive reviews of the game claims it's 8 hours long. I'm sorry, it's just not. It just isn't. Again, I died a bunch and fell through the game's geometry a bunch at the end and had to restart and fiddle with that and I got to a hair over 5 hours on Normal difficulty. It's not an 8 hour game.\n\nThe game has a hard rock soundtrack and a pretty bad attitude. It's almost a horror FPS except that it's not scary, it's just... abrasive. Like you're constantly being yelled at, I guess. It's very loud. There are sporadic moments that are sort of inventive but mostly they're covered by sort of a very generic game shell.\n\nDid I hate it? Well, no, not really. It's functional. It probably doesn't deserve a 50 Metacritic when there are games that are similarly bad or worse and have 25 points higher because they have big name IP or had big publishers. Like, Homefront has a 70 average score. If Homefront is a 70, this is a 70-ish. But do I recommend it? Not really. It's not a great use of your time. You're not going to finish it and say "well, it was rough around the edges but this and this and that were kind of cool". Like, Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is not a good game, but it at least tried and failed to do stuff. Legendary doesn't really feel like it tried, most of the time. I didn't try the multiplayer, which is a GameSpy casualty.","June 2, 2014","false","5.4"," 38 of 71 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","38","71","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/varanisridari/recommended/16730/","varanisridari","Varanis Blackclaw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/varanisridari/","74 products in account","Legendary is that odd little game that stirred up so much disappointment and controversy with FPS fans upon it's intial arrival, but nearly a decade later, is actually much better than a lot of what passes as a FPS game anymore. Granted, this title is still barely Triple-A status, but a far cry from the notorious reputation it garnered. Sadly, this title and the even-more maligned Turning Point: Fall of Liberty both made and broke it's developer Spark Unlimited, which after two failed titles sank into oblivion afterward. This was the far better-looking and far better-playing of the two major-publisher offerings it had, and even though this game's publisher (Gamecock) would also be bought then assimilated into the fold of some larger being, at least for a brief moment it showed that independant developers and publishers could still compete in the Triple-A gaming world. But enough about the back-history, onto the game.\n\nLegendary basically tells the tale of opening Pandora's Box, but in a modern setting. The player assumes the role of Charles Deckard, who is cursed with a life-absorbing sigil on his hand after breaking into the museum holding the box and opening it ubeknownst to it's true power. His employer, one Ormond LeFey, wished to unleash the horrors from the box and then wrestle control of them to rule the world with the help of his Black Order. But the Council of 98 (charged with protecting the box throughout history), jumps to Deckard's aid to try and help set things right. Decent and original enough story, just not executed with the most interesting gameplay.\n\nLegendary isn't awful, it isn't even bad, it just has very conventional Doom/Quake style blast 'em FPS gameplay against mythological baddies like werewolves, minotaurs, dragons, gryphons, Cthulu-style tentacle monsters, and even evil faeries. The garden-variety shotguns, assault rifles, SMGs, grenades etc. serve their purpose just fine, but if anything is to be a let down here, it's the Human enemies and their almost listless AI that prove to be the least entertaining of targets in the player's travels. Additionally, this game has areas of infiinte monster respawns, arbitrarily intermixed with areas of finite enemies, so the player never really knows if they should (or can) clear the area, or just muscle through in a bum-rush fashion onto the next objective. Another gripe is the cumbersome fire axe Decard caries around the whole game a la Half-Life 2's Gordon Freeman; that weapon could have easily just been an extra fillable slot for something else.\n\nGraphics were decried as underwhelming, and I agree that on the console ports, the Unreal 3 engine wasn't properly optimized (as with a lot of mid-2000's third-party titles using the then easy-to-license engine), but on PC, turning up everything to it's highest setting makes Legendary more than sufficiently pretty, if not downright gorgeoous at times, and is one of the better titles I've seen NOT made by Epic Games using the engine. Same goes with the aiming: stiff and oddly wonky on consoles, but smooth and perfectly customizable sensitivity even with gamepad on PC. I think most reviewers were playing this on Xbox 360 anyway at the time, so their arguments hold water for that platform. I remember playing this on 360 and it seemed MUCH worse than the PC version that I almost didn't decide to try due to my bad experience with the console version.\n\nUltimately, this is simple. fantasy-fueled fun that didn't have the right amount of polish or a really hooky multiplayer to reign in enough of the mainstream market, and during a golden era of FPS games where everything was compared to Halo or Call of Duty, that was a massive no-no, in addition to a poorly optimized console port that would end up being the majority of what this game's intended audience played. This should have been more niche, spent a bit more time in the development oven for both the console ports and multiplayer aspects, and maybe Spark Unlimited would be around to this day working on this game's sequels, meaning I would be reviewing the first entry of a franchise instead of a failed attempt to break into the FPS big leagues. For the few bucks this game costs, you could have less fun playing a game on your smartphone, so give it a try.","April 17","true","12.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I had never seen it before and it looked different from the usual fare so I decided to give it a try.  I really enjoyed it, despite a few bugs.  It received some really bad press from IGN and Gamespot, which is odd because when they previewed the game's beta they gave it high marks, so I'm guessing Spark Unlimited couldn't pay for a good review the way some of the larger devs can.  I no longer trust review sites.\n\nI'm going to set the record straight.  Legendary is a pretty good title that's been largely overlooked.  Gameplay is familiar in that it's a fairly straight-forward shooter with a few puzzle elements thrown in.  You get everything from a fire axe to anti-aircraft missiles for an arsenal and gun-toting baddies to a 20-story collosus and everything inbetween for enemies.

You play as Deckard a theif hired to steal Pandora's Box. You then end up unlocking the box and releasing Legendary creatures to cause havoc among the world with the new found power you gained from the box it's up to you to stop what you had set in motion.\nThe power given to you is the ability to absorb the spirits of fallen creatures and either use it to heal yourself or push enemies out of your face. The enemies themselves are pretty interesting and varied. The Werewolves are certainly a favorite of mine because Werewolves won't stay dead unless decapitated, meaning after knocking one down you have to go and chop it's head off before it gets back up, unless of course you were aiming for the head then with a well placed headshot they won't be getting back up.\nThe weapons feel a bit weak and one even sounds like a laser gun but that doesn't mean they are weak. there is a decent enough mix of weapons to change up how you play but it doesn't really matter once you find something you like you will most likely stick with it. Also ammo is scattered all over the game so don't worry too much about it however don't just go around soraying down corridors either.\nSpeaking of corridors this game is VERY linear. it's a straight forward path the entire wa through. Now for me this isn't nessicarilly a bad thing but for others it may be an issue especially for those who enjoy exploring.\nTL:DR I enjoyed my experience with Legendary and it may have some things that turn people off I still like it and recommend it especially given it's current price. Side note just wanna go ahead and say it I feel like this game deserves a reebot. With the technology we have today we could improve this game perhaps make it more open don't make Deckard a mute character and tweak the enemies a bit and it would make a great new gen game.","April 15, 2014","true","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While I doubt it was done intentionally, Legendary acheives a level of such rediculousness through its story, bad acting, and general concept that it is an absolute masterpiece and a joy to play. It blends science fiction with the legend of Pandoras box, throws in some random mythological creatures (such as werewolves, griffins, minators..,) and it some how "works."\n\nThe game feels reminiscent of older games like Doom and the outdated graphics work to it's advantage in that light. The controls aren't perfect, and occasionally feel a little "clunky" (iron sights less accurate than shooting from the hip,) but you quickly adapt by the time you're through the first level.\n\nI picked this up for less than a dollar and I suggest you do too. It's worth a good laugh and to kill some time. Don't go into it expecting the greatest gaming experience of your life though, go in with the same expectations you would watching a b-movie horror/scifi flick, and you'll have a blast reveling in the sheer absurdity of it all.","June 2, 2014","true","7.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

From the storyboards used as cutscenes, to the sticky controls (I use an xbox 360 wired controller and the analogue controls are extremely jerky) this game looks as though it could have been a real gem but constantly falls short.\n\nThere are times when your character literally get's stuck on a ramp or a step, because the programmers haven't made the blocks fit properly. The controls regularly let you down as well, such as the jump (which is the worst jump feature I have ever seen, it's practically a hop) which you can press and time to climb over something and yet you simply don't.\n\nThe story starts of well, but by the end it is clear that the writyers have no real idea what they are doing and it pretty much goes to hell quickly. The missions have you jumping around the globe in an instant and the storyboard cutscenes do a really poor job of showing you any sort of time passing.\n\nThe ending of the game just sort of happens as well. It doesn't really explain (at least very well) what your role is in stopping things, you just have to use your powers to overcharge a computer that is connected to Pandora's Box..... Which personally I find pretty funny considering this is based on a Greek myth and so I would have figured that there would have been a more magical and godly way to close the box, but apparently not.\n\nFinally, the main reason I am leaving a negative review....\n\nI could have lived with everything I have said up until this point and whilst I wouldn't have recommended the game, I wouldn't have complained either. However, right at the end of the game there is an elevator that is simply broken. You stand in the Elevator to go to the final platform, and your character falls straight through and into nothing, seeing the worldspace dissappear into black above you. I looked this up and it is a known issue that has been complained about since what I am assuming is release (2012). There are posts that claim there are ways to fix it, but none of these fixes worked for me. Frankly though, I shouldn't have to fix a game that has been out for at least 4 years anyway. This is a gamebreaking bug and the developer has quite literally ignored it and ignored the complaints that it has triggered. This is unacceptable and frankly it is disgusting. The only way I could complete the game was by using a noclipping (walk through walls) hack that someone on the forums suggested. This led me to wander through the world space until I found the next trigger point to be able to continue the mission. Again, this is pathetic and unacceptable.\n\nDo not buy this game. Whether it is £10 or 1p, I would not recommend paying for a game that is riddled with bugs and where the developer clearly doesn't care. Save your money and buy something from a studio that cares about the product that they release.","April 6","false","13.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/16730/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","A decent cinematic FPS compareable to Half-Life, Bioshock or Metro from its gameplay, pacing and progression making you traverse post-apocalyptic-ish levels by rather indirect means and engaging various types of enemies inbetween.\n\nA wealthy/evil entrepreneur leading a secret society tricked you, a silent mercenary, into opening Pandora's Box in modern New York. Mythological creatures assault the world and you traverse broken - most of the time urban - areas in an effort to halt/reverse the spread utilizing the help of another secret society, man-made firepower and a signet that was burned into the back of your hand when you opened the box and that allows you to absorb energy - "Animus Vitae" - from dead creatures restoring your health as well as stagger them briefly with a burst of it.\n\nThe story is rather basic stuff of evil guy dooming the world and you going to save the day. Well, more or less, as the ending isn't as definitive - the devs clearly left room for a sequel which I would like to see as there is sort of a cliffhanger making me a little hungry for more, but I'm not sure if this will ever happen for this seems like an under-the-radar title. The gamebreaking bug towards the end that the devs obviously never got around to fix seems to be a proof of that (there is one workaround or another for this bug, but its still a severe one).\n\nAiming is rather hard for reasons unknown to me. I haven't fiddled around with the options much but I've read other reviewers had similar issues. It's rather imprecise and twitchy. Putting the crosshair on a certain small spot is almost impossible. It's similar to what I experienced in Bioshock. It's doable when shooting from the hip but aiming down the sights or going for specific hit zones (like the heads) can be a pain. Some reviewers argued this adds to the challenge, and while this is true at first glance it's very artifical nonetheless (I could also blindfold one of my eyes or tie one of my hands to my back to increase the challenge).\n\nSometimes I would have hoped for more checkpoints. One boss fight or another and some puzzle-ish scenes with me interacting with various environmental things to open blocked paths while certain enemies "stalking" me took me longer than I had expected. It felt a little tedious at times. When I took more care and understood how things worked I got them done though.\n\nThe characters could have deserved a bit more love. Besides you, the silent mercenary, and the evil businessman there is a somewhat self-confident and sexy-ish female companion (who may remind the player of Alyx Vance - but then she too was an archetype character), some high-ranking military guy advising/ordering you around and nameless field-operatives you wouldn't want to get to know better as they like to get eaten by the creatures. The characters are not bad for what they are supposed to be - they serve their roles and their voice actors are good - but they aren't surprising or too memorable either.\n\nStill, despite it's flaws and that one bug it's game that plays out fairly well and consistent from start to end. It holds a decent premise of throwing mythological creatures at the world and the player, providing some nice settings (New York Times Square for example) and being pretty good at creating the ambiance that the world is getting torn apart by those creatures, as there are always griffons, werewolves and other creatures lurking about and stalking the close or distant skies, the roofs and walls, the waters and just about anything else. The fight between the two secret societies with you in the middle of it felt quite believable too. The game takes some effort into teaching mythology by providing brief intel about the creatures you encounter (and how the two societies are related to the whole affair) and putting you into the need to adapt a little when fighting them because their nature gives them certain strengths and weaknesses. There are pickable data logs scattered around the levels too that flesh out their background a little, either informing you about the activities of hostile or allied agents on the field or about former citizens and how they experienced the attacks from the creatures.\n\nHad this game gotten more polish and maybe more advertising perhaps it could have been brought to a similar level as Half-Life, Bioshock, Metro or other games of this kind. It's not too far away from that either, however, and in this manner I believe this is an underrated game.","April 18, 2015","true","7.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I got it on the cheap long ago, and it's an interesting concept, if nothing else.\n\nThe game revolves around you, Deckard, who causes the world to be devastated with monsters of forgotten mythology. At the same time, you have parties for and against you, trying to stop you because apparently, they like these monsters to destroy the world, and to help you because the perils of survival rest in your hands. Convenient because you hold the power of Pandora's Box, able to kill or heal with the arcane energy that you recharge by killing your foes and absorbing said energy.\n\nI use these fancy words, but the game is just an FPS for the fairness of it. It runs in Unreal Engine 3, making it semi-pretty, but very meh in visuals. The level design isn't exactly impressive, the world around you is crumbled worse than a Call of Duty setpiece. It's all so standard, the only thing driving it is the mythical creatures that attack and your abilities.\n\nThe game info states that it's a singleplayer game, but it DOES have online multiplayer and support for a 360 controller, although you would be hard-pressed not to use the KB and mouse, since this is a PC title. Obviously, the game's age and lackluster quality means there's basically no community for this game, though.\n\nAt the time of review, this game is on sale for 3 quarters. Less than a dollar, a couple of trading cards will get you this game.\n$0.74. For the price, I'd say you'll get more than your money's worth out of it.

The mix of enemies is nice, as well as the feeling of being caught in a three-sided conflict. Each of the monster enemies has different strategies, creating some tactical variety. The environments, though not particularly original, suit the gameplay quite nicely (although frequently feeling cramped, there aren't enough big open areas that make for the best fights in the game). Unfortunately, Legendary does feel somewhat lacking in content; there are few weapons, and there's little reason to use anything other than the newest weapons you've found (and only one melee weapon available). While the enemies are varied, there's only a few types; more monsters to fight and more variety amongst enemy soldiers would be welcome. The game is also fairly short, and can be beaten in an afternoon without much trouble (which suits the limited enemy types). Animus powers (the games spells, for lack of a better term) also seem underutilized. Walking away from Legendary, it almost feels like a teaser for a better game that, sadly, won't be coming.\n\nOverall, I recommend Legendary for an afternoon of fun; it's enjoyable and different, but it won't blow anyone away.","July 20, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Just when the game seems to be getting good, Right when you're about to have a 'Sorry kid, name's Frank Fontaine' moment, slideshow featuring the coolest damn thing they didn't put in the game, the incredibe setup for a fight that actually grows some sense of attachment for the player now that he knows the character, and roll credits?!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/recommended/16730/","Brogbo","DrBrogbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/","1650 products in account","Traditional Rating - 5.5/10\nRecommendation - Play Singularity instead.\n\nThis game kind of slides into the same slot as Singularity: Slightly-older, somewhat-obscure, non-AAA shooter. Unfortunately, where Singularity shines, this game falls flat. Where Singularity's story is interesting, this one is bland. Where Singularity's gunplay and enemies are interesting, Legendary's are frustrating. The only exception is the BEASTLY fire-axe, which I rather enjoyed.\n\n-The graphics in this game are passable. They fit their purpose, but show their age.\n-The sounds are actually quite good. The burst-fire rifle in particular I enjoyed.\n-The voice acting is on the low side of B-movie quality. C+ movie, maybe.\n-The enemies, for the most part, are quite frustrating. The one enemy I did enjoy is the little rolling brimstone demons. Their AI was fun.\n\nOverall, the game is a disappointment. On the high-side, it's generic. On the low-side, it's teeth-gratingly frustrating. For example, let me explain the moment where I gave up on the game:\n\nThere is a gigantic golem thrashing around the city streets (who for some reason attacks everyone else, but never tries to attack me), and I'm running around charging up EMP generators. Working on the 3rd one, I ran into a building filled with little pixie enemies that can only be hit when they feel like it (they turn "ethereal" and seem to only turn solid when your back is turned), and some little will-o-wisp thing immediately possesses the EMP generator and moves it up a floor. After getting slashed in the back by a dozen more of the stupid little pixies, I make it upstairs, slightly charge the EMP, and it moves up another floor. Kill another dozen pixies, run up another floor, charge up some more, EMP moves to bottom floor again. Run all the way down after killing 2 dozen more pixies, charge up some more, EMP moves to middle floor again. Kill more pixies, run up another floor, charge up more, EMP moves AGAIN. Run to top floor, all the while killing pixies, charge up some more, it moves to a new spot on top floor, charge it up some more, and IT MOVES AGAIN! Smash Alt+F4 so hard the USB drive on my desk falls over.\n\nThat is literally an exact account of what happens in that section. Not one single part of that whole encounter were challenging. The entire thing was just pecking at me. The dumb little pixies posed no threat, except to my patience, and there was no environmental danger either. If there were some increasing level of danger every time it moved, that's one thing, but to move the EMP generator just for the sake of moving it is nothing but busywork.\n\nI get that that is just one tiny moment in the game, and the rest of it could be good, but every single part of the game I did see was utterly joyless, and given how badly that one section ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, I'm done giving Legendary any chances. I did not enjoy it.","April 27, 2014","false","1.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","3"

Its the smell off poor game design. If this game was a potato(its strikingly similar to one), it would be the first potato of the Irish Potato Famine(wiki link here: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)" ) that killed of a million Irish citizens between 1845 and 1852. A friend gifted this game to me when it was on sale for $0.74, instead of the normal $4.99 price tag. Even $0.74 is overpriced for this potato-esque game, a potato costs about $.33, instead of buying this game, you could buy 2 potatoes for $0.66, that's 8 cents less than the price of the game! That is like getting two good potatoes for the price of a different diseased potato(the different potato being "Legendary" of course). When the game isn't on sale, buying Legendary for it's $4.99 price tag is an even bigger mistake than buying it while its on sale for $0.74. Don't waste your money, buy something that is actually useful and buy a 5 pound bag of Russet potatoes for about $3.99, and a bag contains 11-13 potatoes. So not only is it a dollar cheaper, but a bag of potatoes contains 11-13x  the content of "Legendary". Its simple math really, 1 bag of potatoes = 11-13 potatoes, "Legendary" = 1 (diseased) potato , so , 1 times 11 = 11,or, 1 times 13 = 13, and thats how a bag of potatoes has 11-13x the content of "Legendary". Don't waste your money, and buy potatoes instead #Potatoes2014 #PotatoSimulator2014\n\nOne last note, the title of "Legendary" is very misleading as the game is definitely not legendary, "Potato Famine" or "Autism in a Bottle" are more suitable names\n\nPlease, for the sake of potatoes, DON'T buy this game\n\nI'm serious, paying someone $4.99 to kick you in the crotch is a smarter way to spend your money\n\nHell, burning a $5 dollar bill holds more value, you atleast get a miniscule amount of entertainment unlike playing "Autism in a Bottle"\n\nThis concludes my review of "Legendary", I hope you had fun","July 19, 2014","false","1.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Sometimes the game can host fun firefights while most of the time the level design is linear in a claustrophobic and tedious way.\n\nIt also suffers from awkward sub-mechanics as well, especially regarding its enemy types.  For instance\nyou have werewolves that you can permanently kill through unusual means, only to face them in situations where they infinitely respawn which ultimately negates the point of killing them off permanently.  Awkward design decisions are plentiful throughout the experience.  Also why would they design jumping puzzles when the player can only jump upwards or two to three feet max?\n\nBut thats not to say that the game is entirely without fun, there are a couple of neat firefights here and there.  For the most part though it is an jaunt through tedious levels with design that will bore and frustrate the player.  So while there is fun to be had ultimately the majority of the experience is not worth playing.","November 25, 2013","false","6.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Apparently, you've never heard of it before...\n\nAnyway, as expected all hell breaks loose. Mythical monsters roam the planet destroying mankind. (Weak werewolves, regular were wolves, griffons, golems, fire things, mintoaurs, and some bug things.) Now you have to find a way to reseal the box.\n\nGame play is very meh. There are oddly long stretches between fights throughout the game. Your weapon choices are very limited and as pointed out earlier, there isn't a large variety in enemies. Also, I've gone through every possible thing you can do in the game yet Steam shows me as having only played 12 hours.\n\nThe bad part of that is it includes all the time I had it paused and at least an hour of troubleshooting.\n\nWhy was I troubleshooting? Because there is a game killing bug right at the end of the game that the developer never cared about fixing. Getting around it requires some forum searches, some file editing, and possibly installing FRAPS (that fixed it for me).\n\nSo yeah, there's a bug at the end that many people hit, and was never fixed, that literally stopped your progress cold. For me, that's unforgivable, even if the rest of the game wasn't blah.\n\nI'd say my feelings aren't unique because they set this game up for a sequel and you'll notice there isn't one.\n\nSkip it.","January 3, 2015","false","12.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I genuinely recommend play it on easy. The bigger creatures are very hard to beat on normal difficutly, and you end up swearing at it. It constantly goes from easier bit to incredibly hard bit. Shooting is inconsistent, meaning sometimes enemies go straight down, and others take all eight rounds of the shotgun.\n\nIt has a lot of, 'where do I go now' and 'how do I do this', moments.\n\nWeapons only feel medoicre-average maybe, and they swap positions in your mouse scroll. That means you struggle to find the weapon you want in time. Literally sometimes the axe is bound to key 1, then key 3. Your other two weapons keep changing slot.\n\nThere's another really nasty insult which is the radio voice chatter. It is infuriatingly squelchy and screechy. In headphones it's pure pain. I do not know how anyone had the audacity to create and put that in a game.\n\nOverall it's an average-poor old type shooter. Shame because the idea is average-good. I decided to buy it because I saw werewolves and guns on the Steam store page screenshots. In the sale I bought it for £0.39, so I lost nothing because I easily go the fun back. I have played five hours and am tired of it. I might finish it though, but can't say right now; 50/50. I can't recommend it, and I can understand its poor reviews. However if you play on easy and give a it a once through, I can see genuine fun in it.","May 8, 2015","false","6.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I decided to play this seeing that it was only around £1.80, I liked the Idea of the game. The gameplay is relatively straight-forward: Do this, kill this, find your way around or out of this, etc. However, the game's plot is what makes it so good.\n\n--SPOILER ALERT!--\n\nThe story places you in the boots of a man who is persuaded into opening Pandora's box, he inadvertedly sets the world into a cataclysm as mythological creatures begin to invade the world, the myths and the humans are caught in a war. However it only appears that the myths aren't the major threat. early on you find out about the man who hired you -LeFay- is attempting to control the creatures for himself and you are brought into a group known as the Council of 98 who are attempting to stop LeFay's army's -The Black Order- plans. Both the council of 98 and the black order are caught in a war against each other and the myths.\n\n\n-My opinion-\n\nThis game is very good, and I believe that the game is worth playing, as it is extremely well developed and the gameplay is well executed.","July 30, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Zudem wenn ich einige der Negativen Rewiews lese glaube ich die Leute haben temporären Gedächtnisverlust...\n\nZusammenfassung:\nJa es ist kein Weltklasse-Shooter, aber bei einem Preis von 5 Euro ist das Spiel voll in Ordnung und hat viele gute Aspekte.\n\nKurz was zur Story:\nEine Story um Pandoras Box, Okay ein alter Hut Aber an sich ganz gut umgesetzt. Hier und da Logiklücken, aber für einen Shooter eine gute Story und gut in Szene gesetzt. Das Ende hat mich übrigens echt bedauern lassen dass es keinen 2. teil gibt, der wäre bestimmt nochmal besser als das hier.\n\nDas schlechte:\nNun Zuerst muss man da wohl das Gunplay nennen. Es ist nicht kaputt, aber schwammig und im Zielmodus hat selbst die LMG kaum Rückstoß. Zudem stört das gerade im Schleichen extreme Headbobbing hier schon..\nDann noch die andauernden Zwangsbremsen... Hier mal eine Schalttafel überbrückt, hier ein Ventiel gedreht, Da was beiseite geschoben, Ehrlich gesagt, ich verstehe es nicht. Immer wieder muss man eine Tür durch eine übern Daumen ca 10sekündige Aktion öffnen. In den meisten Fällen passiert währenddessen gar nichts. (Ab und an kommt da was aber nur eine Hand voll im Spiel) Deas hält den Spielfluss auf stört aber im Endeffekt nur teils.\nDie KI der Menschlichen Gegner... Wir Schiebens mal auf: 'Der Fokus liegt auf den Monstern' Aber die Menschlichen Gegner sind dumm wie Brot und treffen teils schlechter als jeder Stormtrooper, Der Bösewicht hat wohl keine besonders hohen Einstellungsvoraussetzungen.\nDas 'an die Hand nehmen'... Es ist sooo bescheuert. Du brauchst nicht denken, alles was wichtig ist ist leuchtend hervorgehoben...\n\nDas Neutrale:\nDie Grafik ist mittelmaß, für seine Zeit und die UE3 nicht ganz zeitgemäß, aber es sieht Stellenweise echt gut aus, und an anderen Stellen wieder wie hinge... naja. Es ist ansehnlich, wenn man stellenweise wegguckt.\nDie KI der Monster, sie ist in Ordnung, aber stellenweise auch sehr vorhersehbar.\nDas Leveldesign, teils ist es ein Korridor of Duty, teils bietet es schöne offene Areale mit freiem vorgehen. Nichts besonders gutes, aber die Abwechslung empfinde ich positiv.\n\nDas gute:\nDie Monster. Es ist wirklich toll man hat hier 4 Permanente Gegnertypen, die man jeweils anders bekämpfen muss. Eine gute Abwechslung, die Spaß in den Kampf bringt und teilweise Schlachtflächen, die ein wenig nachdenken erfordern. Hätte ich gerne mehr von.\nDie Bosskämpfe sind extrem gut in Szene gesetzt ohne das Spielgeschehen zu unterbrechen, hierbei auch eine echt gute Umsetzung des Gegnerdesigns.\nDas Anima-System. Du kannst die Seelen der monster sdammeln und dich damit heilen(Und ein paar andere Dinge machen) Ein echt schönes System und eine gut umgesetzte Idee.\nDie Waffenauswahl ist in Ordnung und so gesehen ist jede Waffe hier gut einsetzbar. Trotz allem der Flammenwerfer ist zu stark.\n\nBemerkungen am Rande:\nDer oft genannte Fahrstulbug ist bei mir nicht aufgetreten (Stand 7.5.15) Wird also weg sein.\nDer Multiplayer ist faktisch nicht mehr existent (Gamespy) LAN Ginge noch, aber ist halt LAN.\nEs gibt keinen Grund das Spiel auf Steam zu kaufen solange es nicht im Angebot ist. Wenn ihr wie ich Steam mögt ist Okay, aber es ist hierbei wirklich gleich wenn man sich eine DRM-Freie Version holt.","May 7, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkstarangelo/recommended/16730/","darkstarangelo","DarkStarAngelo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkstarangelo/","764 products in account","You'd think a first person shooter about shooting griffons and werewolves in a apocalyptic world would be LEGENDARY right? Where unleashing a horde of nasty mythical creatures into the world to wreak havoc giving you the satisfaction of hunting down grand beasts would be great right? Well I'll tell you right now that It's not a great game but is it as bad as everybody says? To be honest, with you - no, it's actually a pretty enjoyable game. Not amazing but fun. The campaign will take up to about 6-8 hours to beat so it's not too long but long enough to where you can have a good amount of fun with the game. 6-8 whole hours of nasties that just shot out of Pandora's Box (How a tiny thing could fit so many griffons in is completely beyond me but it's pretty cool) and I want to talk quickly about these nasties because Pandora's Box is meant to based on Greek Mythology right? Well funny enough there is probably only one creature in the game that's based solely on Greek Mythology, and that's the Minotaur. You'd think there would be things like skeletons, cyclopses, harpies, manticores, gorgons and what-not right? Well no, most of the monsters are based on folklore from other places around the world which is cool but still that irks me just a little bit as unnecessary as that sounds but a little bit of mythical consistency would have been nice but then again the story is definitely not the game's strong point. It's a nitpick so I just let it slide.\n\nWell with all the bullocks out the way let's begin the part of the review that actually matters:\nPros:\n- Fun and satisfying gunplay (Yes, you can hip fire just fine which is always a bonus)\n- Beautiful art direction\n- Interesting array of enemies based on myths and folklore around the world\n- Monster AI is quite intriguing and will use the environment best to their advantage (Throw objects, climb across walls, etc)\n- Animus abilities are cool, but you need to strategize on how you use it (Unless there is anima everywhere)\n- No lazy regenerating health, healing is done by collecting anima, basically the blood of your fallen enemies are your source of health\n- The game's Serious Sam Netricsa-styled PDA does provide some fairly interesting lore on the creatures and backstory\n- Controller support which is always nice for those who prefer controller\n- £4 (Or your regional equivalent) is a fair price but I do suggest getting whenever it's on sale\n\nCons:\n- Graphics are very sub-par despite the art direction\n- Enemy human AI are stupid and can be really cheap at times\n- Not many weapons to play around with\n- The campaign is a little too linear\n- I would have liked the campaign to be a bit longer\n- The multiplayer is dead, no you can't go alone and treat it as a horde mode - you need one player on either side which is always a terrible decision when there is an NPC team\n- No bots, for ♥♥♥♥'s sake developers if you want your multiplayer to survive at least put it some ♥♥♥♥ing bots you lazy ♥♥♥♥s - I will criticize any game that does this with their multiplayer\n- Story and characters are paper thin\n- Voice acting is hilariously bad at points\n- Animations for the people are dodgy (They're mostly fine with the monsters)\n- I think the monsters could have better designs, I mean the minotaur looks like a giant baby slamming his rattle all over the place\n- Boss fights are naff\n- Despite the nice little twist, it has a very rushed and terrible ending\n- Odd and bumpy geometry, don't know what's going on with that\n- The elevator before the final battle is bugged to all hell as it throws you out of the map and kills you, so you cannot progress unless you lock the game to 30FPS (Here's the fix for that; Open the PandoraEngine.ini (it is on C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Games\Legendary\PandoraGame\Config-Folder) and search for\n"MaxSmoothedFrameRate=300" then change the 300 to 30) Credit goes to PawPaw on the Steam Forums\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game. It's flawed, VERY flawed but it's a fun and very charming game in it's own right with beautiful art direction, fun gameplay and an interesting array of enemies to fight. I want to see this concept done so much more in games, fighting mythical beasts is actually very satisfying - gunning down werewolves with an LMG? Why not! Shooting Griffons out of the sky with a rocket launcher? Oh yeah! Scorching minotaurs with a flamethrower? Sounds like fun! We've had enough zombie games, we've had enough alien shooters and we've faced terrorists countless sodding times - I think there's enough room to give this concept another bash because it's a fantastic idea even if it's poorly executed here. I want to see more games that take on the whole mythical FPS subject.\n\nI have heard that the multiplayer, despite being dead is actually quite fantastic - it's a mix of a competitive objective-based game mode similar to capture the flag combined with a horde mode as the third NPC team decimates players on both ends but also constitute towards the goal of the main game mode. I am genuinely interested in seeing what this game mode is, I think I'll try it out with someone and see how it goes.\n\nBut yep, my conclusion is it's a fun yet flawed game. Just know that it will have problems going in but if you can stomach the annoyances then you will find a decently fun and charming FPS with a unique twist to it.","December 14, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Completely Disapointed.\nThe game is unpolished in every sense of the word, Weapons feel powerless, Sound design is the exact same Loud echo pop gunshots that COD: WAW and the dev's previous game Turning Point: Fall of Liberty use. Animations are somewhat bearable, but below the standard for late 2008 even.  Scripted events often fail to impress, or assume the player is in a location he might not be in. It was kinda fun-ish. Not Half-life 2 fun. Not even playing tennis or a sport outside fun. But it was fun to overcome the game's challenges which were mostly based on poor design and not actual challenge.\n\nWhich brings me to the reccomendation.\n\nFor 74 cents or even $4.99 It's worth it to try it out. You might kinda sorta have fun. Having paid $50 I forced myself to wade through the terrible emotionless main character, the tedious scripted events, all of it. And It wasn't worth $50 at all. But If it was launched as a budget title for only 19.99 on launch, then dropped to 15, 10, then 5, it would have been far more forgivable. They realized this and it's 1/10th the price when it's not on sale. or typically 3/4th of a dollar when on sale. That is amazing. Spark Unlimited won me back with Lost Planet 3, and even though Legendary isn't nearly a good game, it's worth your chance for three quarters.","September 22, 2014","true","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It feels more like you're in Cloverfield than anything, constantly navigating through crowded cityscapes while they're being destroyed from giant monsters. The game's poorly viewed because it's on more rails than a Disneyland ride, but I realized that this was the best way to see this game: as not much of one. Instead, enjoy the chaos around you as you hold down the W key and look around with your mouse. There are smaller enemies to fight, but nothing taxing. The 3D's showing it's age, so even on maxed out settings the poly modeling and animations just aren't that great. But Legendary makes up for these deficiencies in sheer spectacle...and a $2.50 price tag when I took the plunge.","January 1, 2012","true","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Slightly later you meet your first werewolf that will attack you twice, but won't do any damage to you (you also cannot attack it).\nWhile you solve some of the puzzles the game will just keep on spawning enemies every X seconds until you solve it.\n\nThe first point irritates me enough to just quit the game out right.

While it was fresh and we saw scientist got pulled through ceiling hole and then gibblets came back out. it's no longer so interesting a decade later.\n\nFurthermore, the game basically postulated that not only the legends were all real (all the myth like werewolf, tentacles, and much more were real, there are also hidden forces, very well equipped (equipvalent to modern military), that just suddenly get into the city instead of the real military. Ancient secret societies that stayed together forever, and evil mastermind and all that. It's a lot like Underworld, except it wasn't a war between Vampires and Lycans, but merely, Black Hand (evil) and Council of 98 (good), humans vs. humans.\n\nMechanically the game is a normal FPS, albeit with a bit of extra thing about this "animus". If you defeat one of these special critters, you get to collect their life force, the animus. It can be used to heal yourself, or to power actual devices (why? Don't they have batteries or generators?)  And I'm only a little in. And there are certainly a lot of these creatures.  You can also use the energy to do a "stun bolt". As some of the enemies are infinite respawns, you shold not run out of energy\n\nThe game is also dotted with "environmental puzzles", most of which are rather simple, and one of the earliest stumpers simply didn't give enough hint. At other times, the "break the 4th wall" hint totally broke the mood. For example, how do you kill a werewolf? You "kill" it, then cut off its head\n\nAll in all, Legendary is a relic of the FPS era, with an interesting premise, but so far, there was little of any fight against the critters","July 30, 2013","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is so unashamed to use invisible walls that it becomes massively obvious where the level designer wanted you to go. Gameplay wise, it's your standard First person shooter, with lots of knee high walls, your default squishy human, hard wearing mythical creatures and tank-like minotaurs, but most enemies except for the minotaurs could be taken down in a few well placed shots. The story concept had mileage to go, but somehow this game really didn't do it justice, either they've had to cut the campaign and story down for financial reasons, or from publisher deadlines, but if I'm honest, I don't care. The ending left me feeling like it'd just cut the wettest of farts and left. It has so many bad story cliches, that if it had any more, I'd have thought I were in a printing mill.\n\nAs for the voice acting, I don't know whether they used someone's fake english accent, or they just found some seriously stuck-up lady, but the accent sounded so unbelievably indignant throughout the game, even when you had to save her, not to mention the drawn-out exposition. Hey, I get it lady, I need to go to these three doohickeys and blow them up to shut down the watchamacakllit before time rund out and it goes off... What's that lady, oh, you want to explain it for the extra special soldiers in the room? Sure, it's not like the world is ending and we're on the clock.\n\nIt still has potential for a sequel or DLC levels if they had left out that deus ex machina ending, but sadly, what has been done can not be undone.\n","April 19, 2014","false","10.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The enemies are pretty cool but very monotonous. You'll go through a very redundant, linear path, blasting the same baddie over and over again. As others mention, it's real buggy.

The game is so unashamed to use invisible walls that it becomes massively obvious where the level designer wanted you to go. Gameplay wise, it's your standard First person shooter, with lots of knee high walls, your default squishy human, hard wearing mythical creatures and tank-like minotaurs, but most enemies except for the minotaurs could be taken down in a few well placed shots. The story concept had mileage to go, but somehow this game really didn't do it justice, either they've had to cut the campaign and story down for financial reasons, or from publisher deadlines, but if I'm honest, I don't care. The ending left me feeling like it'd just cut the wettest of farts and left. It has so many bad story cliches, that if it had any more, I'd have thought I were in a printing mill.\n\nAs for the voice acting, I don't know whether they used someone's fake english accent, or they just found some seriously stuck-up lady, but the accent sounded so unbelievably indignant throughout the game, even when you had to save her, not to mention the drawn-out exposition. Hey, I get it lady, I need to go to these three doohickeys and blow them up to shut down the watchamacakllit before time rund out and it goes off... What's that lady, oh, you want to explain it for the extra special soldiers in the room?

Instead, enjoy the chaos around you as you hold down the W key and look around with your mouse. There are smaller enemies to fight, but nothing taxing.

Completely Disapointed.\nThe game is unpolished in every sense of the word, Weapons feel powerless, Sound design is the exact same Loud echo pop gunshots that COD: WAW and the dev's previous game Turning Point: Fall of Liberty use. Animations are somewhat bearable, but below the standard for late 2008 even.  Scripted events often fail to impress, or assume the player is in a location he might not be in. It was kinda fun-ish. Not Half-life 2 fun. Not even playing tennis or a sport outside fun. But it was fun to overcome the game's challenges which were mostly based on poor design and not actual challenge.\n\nWhich brings me to the reccomendation.\n\nFor 74 cents or even $4.99 It's worth it to try it out. You might kinda sorta have fun. Having paid $50 I forced myself to wade through the terrible emotionless main character, the tedious scripted events, all of it. And It wasn't worth $50 at all. But If it was launched as a budget title for only 19.99 on launch, then dropped to 15, 10, then 5, it would have been far more forgivable. They realized this and it's 1/10th the price when it's not on sale. or typically 3/4th of a dollar when on sale. That is amazing.

And it is very well delimited by walls, rocks, humans that block the way, and so on. Pathetic...\n- Stupid monsters. They are not characterized and you just have to use much or less bullets to kill them. And if bullets are not sufficient, take a rocket. Easy, isn't?\n- The Pandora's box looks like the Arc of Alliance. If you say so...\n- If this is a storyline... It seems that it was scriptured by a children of 4 or 5 years.\n- You WON'T BE ABLE to complete the game, because of a ridiculous bug on the ending part, when you enter in a lift. No comment...\n- The character can run only for a second. After that, he is already tired. Whooooaaa.... Oh, and it jumps like a dump. He can make a 1 km jump when running, and a 1 cm jump when not running. Incredible!!!\n\nIn the end, DO NOT BUY this game, unless someone is pointing a gun at you.

Do like beingforced to rewatch those horribley long cuts every time to fail? Dos clunky anamtions and enemies that stand behind you sound like their right infront of you get you hyped? then this is the game for you! Sadly its not for me. So ignoring the fact that it takes more then one try to jump over a single object or that you cant pass an enemie in a hallway, this game is just constricting you in every lvl, and the color scheme makes it very difficult to find the objectives. Near the begining of the game you litterly are stuck in a lvl where you have to have to shoot barrols of water to lower a stan. However the game doesn't tell you to shoot the buckets that look like all the other buckets because those specific buckets have water in then and lower a stand that though has no visible rope. Have your firends play this if you want to see them lose their minds but not for yourself.","June 28, 2014","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It wasn't... I can't help but be mixed up about this game. All the selling points are there in the game but then you run into the execution of the game itself what look like minor flaws turn into major ones that are dampening the game experience. The game looks sweet, no denying that but you main character seems to walk dragging his feet. Little things on the ground that even real people in life would just step over trap you in this game. As far as the jump button in this game, the developers went for reality's life real jump as in the character can only jump about a foot and a half. That makes jumping redundant in this game, anything waist level... your not getting over and anything knee level looks like you could just walk over then you get stuck saying 'really? I gotta jump that?'. It's this flawed gameplay that keeps Legendary from being a 'Legendary Game'. I'm keeping this game just because it looks so sweet and has awesome looking enemies but the gameplay is bad enough that until I'm bored with nothing else to do, only then do I fire up Legendary. This game by all rights should be an awesome game then someone turned around and glued the main character's feet to the ground and made navigating a simple room a maze of unmovable minor things.

Oftentimes, it seems that teams who are so passionate about their projects for some reason or another just miss the mark. This is one of those occasions. The dev diaries, trailers, promotional materials all made this game seem extremely promising. Pandora's Box is opened and mythical creatures from Greek myths roam the lands in modern-day New York (I think?). Sounds cool, sounds fun, sounds "fresh" as the marketing and branding teams wants you to think.\n\nDo not, under any circumstances, purchase this game. This goes on the "why do I own this?" list of my collection. This shooter came out in the aftermath of a shooting rennaisance - Halo, Call of Duty(s), Battlefield(s), amongst many others - and yet couldn't take the queues from games that know how to make shooters and make a decent clone. A brief, and kind, summary:\n\n-poor controls\n-awful graphics\n-forgettable, unrelatable, and despicable protagonist\n-poor writing\n-absolutely no motivation for your actions\n\nI would go more into depth with flowery prose, but I just want to distance myself from this game as soon as possible. I know many, many people spent years of their lives making this thing come together. I really wish they could have spent that time on a project that was enjoyable.\n\nJust... don't do it.

And as soon as i played it , it had a problem with loading the textures, which was resolved by just restarting the game. Well anyways, the basic game setup was good, fighting mythical creatures, but the game lacked so much potential it could have had. Basically a corridor shooter cause there is hardly any room to explore anything. And collecting the data PDA's was basically pointless.

I was excited to play this game as I thought that it looked very interesting and to be a good game. I loved the idea of what this game was about, and it would've been a good game, but it was poorly made. A crappy fps with bad game mechanics and some poor graphics, but the graphics were as to expect from a game from 2008. The use of the healing and psy(?) powers did not work well for me, and I don't know if this was a problem only I was having, but for most of the game when I needed to, I could not heal. So I died, a lot. The walking speed is too slow in my opinion and for having a very short running period, so it's tedious to move around. (Jumping sucks too). But, the game still has it's fun moments. Just most of the moments are just tedious or not too exiting. It is an "okay" game, but I do not recommend to buy it unless it is on a very low sale. I got it for .74$ on a sale, and I think that it's a perfect price to pay for it. Only buy if its on sale for at least a dollar. I give the game 5/10.","June 21, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I was always into mythology when I was a kid so the concept was fascinating to me.  The good parts are the story, which isn't bad and there are a nice variety of levels to play around in. It's short which means I can finish it and move on (which I did) The bad parts is a lot of everything else. The game is extremely linear until you come across an environmental puzzle and your next move isn't always clear. The guns feel extremely underpowered (it's actually better to use an axe in the early part of the game). And the worst sin of all: Hold [E] to bypass and/or turn.  There are so many valves to turn and control panels to bypass you could easily have taken another hour of play time off.  Overall did I hate it? No. But if you can get this game for a buck ,which I think it has been, you'll definitely get your $$$ worth. I got this in a Groupees bundle and I finished this game, which is more than I can say than about 75% of the games I;ve gotten in bundles.","December 14, 2012","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the solid 5/10 meta score and the low price of $5 it's easy to assume this game isn't worth your time but it definitely deserves a look. By no means is it a blockbuster triple A title but what it is is a short fun FPS with innovative ideas and an intriguing story. Don't buy it if the slightest bit of repetitive gameplay annoys you or else the limited different types of enemies and needing to hold E for every door might get you down but if you're out of a game to play and like a little First Person action then pick this up. If it goes on sale then you have no excuse not to!\n\nIn short - Buy it and love it for what it is, a short fun FPS to fill in the gaps.","May 23, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, if I had tried it 10 years ago I might have been satisfied with this purchase. The thing is, the game came out in 2008. I personally didn't finish the game, and more than likely won't ever do so, especially since my library is already backlogged so heavily, so please take all of this with a grain of salt. Anyway, let me explain the issues:\n\n-Graphics are barely passable as an early Xbox 360 game, even at the maximum settings\n-Animations are laughably bad, both on the human and creature models\n-The environments have little to no way of telling you what to do next or where to go. Granted, it usually can be figured out pretty quickly since the player can only jump a maximum of 5 cm, usually only leaving one possible path.\n-Werewolves have a cool mechanic where you have to decapitate them to kill them otherwise they regenerate. Wish the same could be said for other enemies. The developer must have realized this too, and decided to make the werewolf the enemy you face (besides other humans, who also for some reason want to kill you for opening the box) at least 90% of the time\n-Subways and indoor areas were entirely overused, which is a shame, as the opening outdoor sequence was pretty cool, even though it didn't wow in the graphics department.\n-Why is literally everyone covered in blood?! Seriously, damn near every character in the opening sequence is covered head to toe in blood. A nitpick, but it bugged me.\n-Physics based objects, when they do appear, are super wonky. This also extends to the ragdoll effects.\n-Controls arent terrible, but definitely could have been much more refined. The aim down sights could probably have been excluded and I wouldn't have complained in the slightest.\n-Voice acting is wooden, the story is not the slightest bit coherent, other than the main concept introduced in the first few minutes\n\nPros:\n-Cool opening city destruction scene\n-Liked the general look of some enemies\n-The concept was what actually pushed me to buy the game. You open Pandora's Box, a bunch of scary monsters and ♥♥♥♥ come out and wreck everything and you gotta go kill em all and save the city.\n\nRemember, I did not finish the game, so don't completely disregard this if it is in fact on sale. Hoever, as I pointed out in my review, the game suffers more than just a bad story and bad visuals. It was simply not fun to play.\n\n3/10 regret purchasing","December 13, 2014","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To be honest, there are a few interesting things in this game but... There are way more cons then there are pros to help it stand out, leaving you with a game that pretty much falls flat on it's face!\n\nThis certenly isn't the number one worst game out there at all, but it also not one you should pay full price for. In the end  though, you might want to get this game anyway just to see how a potentailly good game idea, can go really bad.","December 14, 2014","false","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Legendary a good game?!?!? But I am being serious here. I loved this game. Everyone says either "It is pretty moderate for a shooter" or "Bad game"  which I don't understand at all. I had more fun with this shooter than COD! In COD you fight a bunch of similair stupid ♥♥♥ enemies who have no special abilities at all. Or you play an average zombie survival mode. Or you play online agains't a bunch of screaming kids and swearing adults with absolutely no innovation at all even in the sequels it is almost exactly the same. What happens in Legendary? Griffins swoop down picking up enemies in their mouths and eating them. Werewolfs lunge at you and throw objects at you and when they are killed you have to chop of their heads or they recuperate. Fire drakes shoot fire out of their mouths at you but can be taken care of by activating a sprinkler or shooting a fire extinguisher. And while you are doing this a MASSIVE golem above is smashing through buildings and stepping on fleeing people. Also a giant tentacled beast is grabbing allies and pulling them to a watery grave. And guess what. Those tentacles can also grab you and the golem can also step on you. All these mythical creatures from different cultures are trying to kill you while you are trying to destroy a golem by activating 3 EMPs to seperate the energy of the golem from the body. Explosive spiders from Japan, Fire Drakes from old tales and a Kraken from common folklore. My favourite creature is the Nari. A creepy bat like creature with a childs face who can become a ghost and              a physical creature. They often possess objects and throw them at you and generally make life a pain. They steal objects needed for objectives and force you to chase them down often leading you to traps. One time a Nari stole a valve I needed to proceed and dropped it in a suspicious looking chamber. When I entered the doors closed and a fan possessed by the Nari  started sucking me towards it. Only by shooting the supports could I barely escape and when I did I was attacked by a tentacle and almost pulled towards my doom. And that is only level 2. The only bad thing I would say about this game is the graphics however because of the graphics it works on less powerful computers like mine. Some of the most popular games also have bad graphics like HL2 and Killing Floor but noone complains about that. All in all I would give it an 8/10. Definitely worth playing and fun.","July 24, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not much else to say about it since the issue with the drops has stopped me from playing, for the most part.\nUPDATE, Sep 19, 2014: So, after pretty much ignoring this title in my list and letting it rot, I'm finally giving it a whirl again and would believe it took a massive, ridiculous upgrade past the requirements to get this to work better? 24 gigs of ram and a GeForce GT 740 -- there's still some clipping here and there, but overall the framerate drops are less dramatic, making this game playable. I've also tested disabling HID compliant devices in the device panel, which seemed to help. For anyone looking to get this sucker working, I would recommend the HID compliant items be disabled first.

Even on my good computer, I get frame-rate drops to near-crashes.. What a shame really.\nAside from that, it makes me sort've remember playing Half-Life 2 in some ways. Not much else to say about it since the issue with the drops has stopped me from playing, for the most part.\nUPDATE, Sep 19, 2014: So, after pretty much ignoring this title in my list and letting it rot, I'm finally giving it a whirl again and would believe it took a massive, ridiculous upgrade past the requirements to get this to work better? 24 gigs of ram and a GeForce GT 740 -- there's still some clipping here and there, but overall the framerate drops are less dramatic, making this game playable. I've also tested disabling HID compliant devices in the device panel, which seemed to help. For anyone looking to get this sucker working, I would recommend the HID compliant items be disabled first. That may have been the issue from the getgo.","January 8, 2013","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't remember his full name so I just called him Deckard Cain and you work with the Good Illuminati against the Bad Illuminati. Neither of the sides are actually called the Illuminati but ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥ do you expect me to remember their actual names?\n\nThe game is mostly a forgettable FPS with difficulty that goes all over the place (seriously why the ♥♥♥♥ is it easier to fight a bunch of werewolves and a minotaur than a bunch of Bad Illuminati stooges with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ guns). However one moment has scarred me for life. During a later part in the game, you see a giant squid destroying the Big Ben. The idea of destroying the Big Ben, the tower that tells the people of England what Bong it is, is an act worse than Pearl Harbor, 9/11 and the Holocaust.\n\nOverall, I think England should nuke Olympus since Pandoras Box  is from Greek Mythology. Besides the Greek Pantheon are a bunch of homosexual old men (and women) whereas Norse Mythology is full of badass ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Like Thor.\n\nVote for Thorman in 2016.

Decard has to kill the monsters from various myths and save the world.\n\nThis has been a very pleasant surprise for me. The story is very cliche really and the game could do with a bit of polish. The sceneries and pacing however really make this game. In the beginning a great golem made from cars and wreckage roams through NYC, destroying everything in its path. Later Decard has to defeat a giant Kraken in London.\n\nThe campaign is quite short, only around 7 hours, but that is a good thing: The developers didn't reuse and repeat the sceneries over and over. Instead I always had the feeling of actually going forward, something other arguably better games like Doom 3 did not manage.\n\nFor the price the game is definetively recommended.","November 3, 2012","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess its possibly due to it needing Physx, but it doesn't really make it to difficult to play as it only lags if theres a lot going on like pillars falling or stuff blowing up. I however would still not recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have a Nvidia card that can run something with Physx smoothly as I think thats the problem with mine since mines an AMD card. The graphics are that of an early/mid ps3 game and the controls are that of an old fps. The only thing I didn't really enjoy with controls is the constant "Hold E to interact" commands that showed up. I also am not able oddly enough to change anything in the options that pertains to resolution or quality to see if turning that down would help with my lag issue. With all the problems I have with the game and the E command I do noy recommend the gamr.","January 26, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was as if a crappy SciFi channel movie was made into a video game. The plot was dang there nonexistent, and the controls were absolute trash. There is no real redeeming quality about it. From the moment I started, I wanted it to end. This game may very well be a crime and sin against humanity. I would wish death upon my worst enemy before giving him this game. If I were to give someone this game I would be an accessory to suicide. Those released from Guantanamo would question their freedom after playing this game. As a matter of fact, the CIA should add this to their list of torture methods. The only reason I played through was due to a bet. And I feel sorry for my friend because he was better off using his 75 cents elsewhere. If this game were free you would still be losing. The best thing that came from this game is the number of negative reviews I got to read.

Levels open up as you progress, atmosphere can swing from dark, highlighted coridors and sewers to bright courtyards in a church/cathedral, and the dusty, vehicle and debris filled streets of New York. The weapon list may be a short one, but each weapon has it's advantages over another, without filling your arsonal with random ♥♥♥♥. Beign a console to PC port it doesn't take much to run, but that doesn't mean the graphics don't look great (even for this year, I haven't even run it with GPU PhysX; my card is a 270X). The game is based on a health bar system, collecting the fuel to replenish it from dead mythicals.\n\nPersonally the game felt a lot like FarCry 2, Crysis 2, and Bioshock to me (all in a good sense, I recognise that FC2 and C2 are hated amoung the series, but seriosly give all 4 of them a chance). When it comes to public reviews (Gamespot, IGN, etc.) the only honest reviews (I can find) come from PlayStation Magazine (less so, a little harsh but Sony does force their exclusives onto people of the wrong demographic all the god-damn time), GameInformer (also a little harsh, it's the Unreal Engine (no offense), it can't do  really increadable things  (Antichamber was a greate game, but there are graphic ♥♥♥♥ who critisize it)), Gameplanet and Xbox Magazine, these 4 being less intimidated by Gears of War 2 (Impossible from PDM), FarCry 2, Call of Duty WAW and other during it's release.\n\nWhile I haven't tried the multiplayer mode myself (I have also heard that there aren't many players), the game doesn't really on PvP TDM, but more a single, objective based gametype where you collect the essence from the mythicals, first to fill their collector wins.\n\nI sugest having an Xbox 360 controller for this, being a game that was developed on consoles (I would recomend a controller anyway, it isn't PvP so you won't get beaten by an elite player with a laser/high accuracy/performance mouse).\n\nPS.

Legendary a good game?!?!? But I am being serious here. I loved this game. Everyone says either "It is pretty moderate for a shooter" or "Bad game"  which I don't understand at all. I had more fun with this shooter than COD! In COD you fight a bunch of similair stupid ♥♥♥ enemies who have no special abilities at all. Or you play an average zombie survival mode. Or you play online agains't a bunch of screaming kids and swearing adults with absolutely no innovation at all even in the sequels it is almost exactly the same. What happens in Legendary? Griffins swoop down picking up enemies in their mouths and eating them. Werewolfs lunge at you and throw objects at you and when they are killed you have to chop of their heads or they recuperate. Fire drakes shoot fire out of their mouths at you but can be taken care of by activating a sprinkler or shooting a fire extinguisher. And while you are doing this a MASSIVE golem above is smashing through buildings and stepping on fleeing people. Also a giant tentacled beast is grabbing allies and pulling them to a watery grave. And guess what. Those tentacles can also grab you and the golem can also step on you. All these mythical creatures from different cultures are trying to kill you while you are trying to destroy a golem by activating 3 EMPs to seperate the energy of the golem from the body. Explosive spiders from Japan, Fire Drakes from old tales and a Kraken from common folklore. My favourite creature is the Nari. A creepy bat like creature with a childs face who can become a ghost and              a physical creature. They often possess objects and throw them at you and generally make life a pain. They steal objects needed for objectives and force you to chase them down often leading you to traps. One time a Nari stole a valve I needed to proceed and dropped it in a suspicious looking chamber. When I entered the doors closed and a fan possessed by the Nari  started sucking me towards it. Only by shooting the supports could I barely escape and when I did I was attacked by a tentacle and almost pulled towards my doom. And that is only level 2. The only bad thing I would say about this game is the graphics however because of the graphics it works on less powerful computers like mine. Some of the most popular games also have bad graphics like HL2 and Killing Floor but noone complains about that. All in all I would give it an 8/10.

I love the London setting, they got a really good palette. I wish Diablo 3 was that dark :( There are some odd things, like the "glow" in some enemies and very sparkly blood. And I didn't like the Black mercenaries models: they look like straight from Speed Racer! LOL\n7\nStory\nI found it very interesting! The plot twist is not absurd, like in 99% of the games (The same old "You know, that guy that doesn't look alright? Yes he is the traitor!"), fit the story very well.

No replay value at all, and feels too repetitive. If you want a similar game to this with a higher replay value, I would recommend Darkness 2.

Do you like mythological creatures?\n\nWell I sure hope you do, because this game is literally throwing all sorts of mythos at you with no legitimate reason at all. Sure, Pandora's Box opened and is unleashing hell on New York, but who really cares? Well obviously you do since you were branded by Pandora's Box and now have the power to absorb the creature's life force. Jewish mythos? There. Greek mythos? Obviously. Irish mythos? Why not! Heck it even has the mythological creature of obscure cultrures. Thanks, Legendary.\n\nWhy did all of this happen? What did New York do?\n\nWell okay, you're some sort of person who does dangerous and odd jobs. For example, mowing the lawn for that old lady who lives on the incredibly steep hillside. Your back's gonna need some time to recover from all that leaning. But really, this old rich dude is obviously the spokesperson of white capitalism and asks you to insert a key into Pandora's Box. Because unleashing hell for about $10,000 is a good investment, right? Of course it is, Deckard.\n\nAll in all, I give this game a 7/10. The gameplay is dull, the voice acting is alright I guess, and the graphics aren't anything to write home about. Though the real seller for this game is the fact that those GRIFFONS LOOK SO MENACING AND COOL LIKE HOLY COW I WANNA HAVE THAT GRIFFON'S MYTHOLOGICAL HUMAN-EAGLE-LION BABIES.

This game has alot of cool moments, but at other times it feels a tad bit boring. Especially at the end, there isn't any feeling of urgency during the final level. I only died once, and it was because one of the monsters in this game, the minotaur, is a pain in the ♥♥♥. He will constantly follow you, running at your pace unless your sprinting, he flawless tails you even when charging, he runs through the walls in the arenas, that they put you in to fight him, flawlessly, it's like he can walk through the damn things. The game tells you to shoot him in the back, and that is super difficult because he rarely charges and when he does, it's hard to dodge. Every other enemy though is easy to fight. This game will turn into a puzzle game easily, there will be times where you have no idea what to do, and the solution is so obvious you don't notice it. The weapon switch is super slow. When you try to heal yourself with the "aminus" juice you have, it takes a little longer than it should, and is hard to control. God help you if you're trying to pick up a weapon while running if you're being chased, it's a huge thing that would've helped me during a lot of battles. On the good side the cutscenes, soundtrack, atmosphere is amazing, the AI is ok, i've seen them do some stupid ♥♥♥♥ though. Overall for five dollars i think this is a steal, if you like games with good graphics that run well even on the highest settings with bad pc parts, this is your game, my ram runs at like 500 mhz, and i ran it on highest settings.","July 19, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was always into mythology when I was a kid so the concept was fascinating to me.  The good parts are the story, which isn't bad and there are a nice variety of levels to play around in. It's short which means I can finish it and move on (which I did) The bad parts is a lot of everything else. The game is extremely linear until you come across an environmental puzzle and your next move isn't always clear. The guns feel extremely underpowered (it's actually better to use an axe in the early part of the game). And the worst sin of all: Hold [E] to bypass and/or turn.  There are so many valves to turn and control panels to bypass you could easily have taken another hour of play time off.  Overall did I hate it? No. But if you can get this game for a buck ,which I think it has been, you'll definitely get your $$$ worth.

I was always into mythology when I was a kid so the concept was fascinating to me.  The good parts are the story, which isn't bad and there are a nice variety of levels to play around in. It's short which means I can finish it and move on (which I did) The bad parts is a lot of everything else. The game is extremely linear until you come across an environmental puzzle and your next move isn't always clear. The guns feel extremely underpowered (it's actually better to use an axe in the early part of the game). And the worst sin of all: Hold [E] to bypass and/or turn.  There are so many valves to turn and control panels to bypass you could easily have taken another hour of play time off.  Overall did I hate it? No. But if you can get this game for a buck ,which I think it has been, you'll definitely get your $$$ worth.

A little annoyed at the game-breaking bug in the elevator at the end. Don't know why or how that exists. Other than that, the game is fine. Graphics and fps are really good considering this game is little over seven years old now. Kind of wish they would make a sequel with less linear gameplay and a lot more types of creature enemies. That is my one complaint: I feel the creature enemy variety is a little lacking. I mean...you can only chuck so many werewolves, firedrakes, minotaurs, griffons, and nari at the player before they say "okay, what else you got?". Granted, the big enemies do mix it up just a little. Releasing the Kraken and spawning a junk golem are about the only true bosses in the game. The rest of them like the alpha werewolves, minotaurs, and griffons feel like nothing but minibosses. And when you get the rocket laucher? Forget it. Even the most stubborn griffon is a one-hit killshot. If I was going to design a sequel to this game, I'd have stuff like vampires, basilisk dragons, harpies, hydras, weretigers, wyverns, and other creatures of mythology in there with all the baddies from this game to mix up the combat. All in all, a good game that I think its good to play through at least a few times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megamatics/recommended/16730/","Megamatics","Optimus_Mega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megamatics/","212 products in account","This game is Legandary... If we're talking about simplistic, and slow. You wont find much to differ this game from other shooters besides the painstakingly broken healing, and easy enemies. If you're not being 1 hit killed by some random annoying thing, it's the pace killing puzzle sequences, like some kind of poor-man's Half-Life 2. Often does this game feel as if it doesn't know exactly what it is... Are you a shooter?, dark fantasy set with greek mythological themes?, or a plot driven set-piece affair? I really wish I could love this game; but that appears to be impossible at this point.\n\nTowards the beginning I was struggling with only a pistol vs enemies with no discernible weak point. Enemies that spit fire at you from all directions. This was not so bad as it felt challenging... That was until I learned how to heal. From then on, I haven't died a single time to a normal enemy. Only the cheap kills sometimes manage to get me; but beyond that, there were no struggles exhibited from fighting any of the normal enemies. The AI is not so bad; but the healing factor is just too good in this game.\n\nYou then reach the later levels of the game, where it suddenly ramps up the difficulty, artificially. The enemies are not more difficult, they just start to spawn in certain places infinitely. It Serves to waste ammo and create tedium, as enemies do not give you even a second to think about your surroundings. The game legitimately tries to have you solve problems while facing off with a never ending onslaught of Werewolves, and Exploding Spiders. This wouldn't be so annoying if you didn't move around like you had a weight strapped to your ankle. The Main Protagonist can neither jump high enough, or move fast enough to evade enemies for very long. It serves to note that his impressive run-jump can't be used in any other direction but forward. Jumping is the same as dodging in a first person shooter, and with this mechanic so severely crippled, it just made it easier to get infuriated as I tapped the force push mechanic.\n\nThe force push becomes even more important late game; but they were smart to make this ability also require the power you use to heal, to use it. You'd have 3 or 4 chances at the push move before it was depleted, and enemies are pretty relentless about charging you. The great thing is, you can't use any ability while you reload, which lead to some rather frustrating deaths in heated combat. The limitations, and player limitations totally handicap you into becoming nothing but a walking turret. I've played Wolenstein 3D many times, and love the game; but this game spits on it's legacy with how embarassingly bad it is. It is true that you don't need to be able to jump, or have super quick movement; but you just feel gimped in the face of all the enemies in this game.","May 22","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having said that, Legendary might be considred a short story precursor to later and greater games like, Bioshock.\nLegendary's strength lies in it's ability to quickly and thouroughly suck you into the storyline and gameplay. The gameplay is broken up in the time-honoured fashion of action-filled chapters, with storyboard cut-scenes filling in the gaps between locations. Therein lies one reason the game is so short in comparison with something like Deus Ex: Human Revolution, where instead everything is played out in-game; and to be honest, it was refreshing. Upon reflection though, there is A LOT of gameplay there that could have been included, but while actually playing the game, you don't feel as though you're missing out.\nI can only think of two negatives that really stuck out, and one of them is kind of subjective I suppose, and that is that one of the epic boss monsters doesn't actually get its own boss fight. If they ever did/do the (obvious-from-the-ending) sequal, that's something that you would hope to see tied up for sure. The other is an immersion-breaking render glitch that requires you to edit the engine .ini to proceed to the final showdown.\nI think I paid $5 or so for Legendary, and for the few small things I didn't like, there were nine good hours of content that I loved. Definitely the most enjoyable title I've played this year.","April 21, 2013","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Bouncing gernades off walls or using like land mines is your friend.
