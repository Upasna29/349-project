This is less of an in depth review and more of a preview.\n\nThis is Mario Maker as a bullet hell shooter. I like that you have 360 degree shooting instead of just straight forward, but basically this game is a bullet hell shooter where all the levels are made by other people who own the game. How good the game is going to largely rely on the content made by the community.\n\nHowever, the mechanics felt good and the tools are solid. I like the customization for designing levels, and I'm really interested in seeing where the game goes from here. I wish more things were unlocked straight from the beginning, but I wouldn't be surprised to see stuff like that changed.\n\nI also like the art in game, but the portrait art is not my favorite.","December 3, 2015","true","4.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Now it's real.\nIt's the perfect mix for both casual and hardcore players: fast matches for casual, much depth/longevity for pro players.\n\nThere is a hall with a global chat, a friend list, your faction, your upgradable stats, your inventory (which contains materials and upgradable weapons), and a couple of panels to start Custom player scenarios, or the editor, to build (test and share) your levels. Here you can spend the points earned by playing, to unlock new drones, modules, parts, bosses, weapons, etc... these ones are used to make your custom levels more challenging. Every drone unit has a different ability (example: Mandible units are able to drop black holes, which attract you), so the gameplay is extremely fun because of the unit combinations. The editor is very easy, everyone can build something through endless possibilities. Also, they are going to add many other game modes.\n\nAs 2D shooter game, starting a match is fast and not stressful, but in the meanwhile, there is a RPG part if you want to farm, or a leaderboard dedicated to every single scenario, if you want to improve your scores and beat the other players like a pro!\n\nIn other words, this is A GAME FOR ALL.","December 4, 2015","true","19.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I didn't play around in the creator mode too much(my husband did though) but the actual gameplay was very engaging. The style of the visuals were incredibly vibrant and stood out immediately when I booted it up.\n\nThe level creator is very Mario Maker-ish like the other reviews here have mentioned, but it also comes with the tools to modify and create your own End Bosses. Straight down to their design and coloring. Plus with the grid system it offers it gives you freedom to place waves in certain positions to influence their flight paths.\n\nThe controls were fluid for both the keyboard and mouse AND the twin stick gamepad so it is easy to pick up out of the gates, which is a MAJOR bonus to people who aren't that good at twin stick shooters. If you're a novice or expert at the game you can pick it up and play it without any problems. (Unless you're me lol)\n\nEven though it may be in early access, it'll just continue to improve over time. I'm actually looking forward to the updates that'll come for the game so I can try and get better at it.... since I am actually horrible at shooters like this... or shooters in general really.","January 19","true","1.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suntank/recommended/422030/","suntank","◄ChoZo►","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suntank/","164 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReVeN XBridge is a game for people who are sick of mindless shooters currently flooding the market. With RPG elements and a social network along with limitless amounts of user created content, this game has something everyone. Also, an impressive amount of content is on the rise as this game gets frequent updates with content and gamemodes to keep things interesting. You really get waaaaay more than you pay for with XBridge. Highly Recommended.\n\nBtw if you do get this game, Play my level "HyperSpace". Can you beat my score? :D","December 11, 2015","true","36.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Well... maybe not perfect but definitely a blast. The game has a lot going for it.\n\n-Avatar Creator\n-Level Editor\n-Boss Creator\n-Inventory System (Though it doesn't seem to have much use yet)\n-Friends list\n-Open chat channel\n-Player Created Levels HUB Menu\n\nYou will find yourself doing two things in the games current state... Blasting your way through rainbows in the shape of space ships or constructing your very own vividly colored levels and bosses for players to encounter. OVerall its a very simple game with a lot of depth. I can see this game expanding further with new enemy ship variants and boss parts!\n\nIf you fancy yourself a creative game with a mix of A LOT of colorful explosions then ReVeN: XBridge is a game that won't dissapoint. It has been a long while since a developer has reinvigorated the topdown shooter genre, Varia Games definitely has done such a thing with this game. I look forward to more updates that could expand the game and future titles from these guys.\n\nThanks for the 30+ hours of fun I've had with this title! I just can't stop building bosses that wreak havoc on players! :D","January 19","true","314.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The combat is fast paced and is a flawless bullet-hell style game. The level creator is easy to use, bosses are fun to build and experiment with, and it's easy to share / play shared levels.\n\nThe reason I wouldn't recommend this game is because there's not nearly enough content to warrent a 15$ price tag. At the time of writing this review, with the game having been out for nearly 2 months, there was only a tutorial and less than 20 shared levels. Until the development picks up and adds a campaign, or the community grows and more levels are shared, I wouldn't pay more than 5$ for this game.\n\nThe developers also ignore small mistakes that shouldn't have been missed. Menu items that won't highlight but can still be clicked. Screens you can go into but there's no easy way to get out of. The leaderboard will update with your name and score but won't update your profile image. Small problems, but unacceptable considering the size of their team. When a developer overlooks small issues so that they can rush to release a game in early access it destroys any hope that this game will be anything more than a cash grab. This game shouldn't have been released yet.\n\nI'll continue to have some faith that the game will be fixed and become worthy of it's price tag, but until it does, I can't in good faith recommend this game.","January 31","false","2.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Problem is, no matter what I do, I can't log in ! I got in once a couple of days ago, but after that, no luck. I've tried logging in from my PC shortcut AND from within Steam. it just....don't. I do not have this problem with other Steam games. Seems ya'll still have a bug or two on the loose. I Want to like this game...but so far no joy.","April 27","false","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
