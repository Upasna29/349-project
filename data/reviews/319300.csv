"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/319300/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","After having played Train Town I had serious doubts about developer N3V’s next game, Trainz Trouble, but it turns out I had nothing to worry about. In fact, it’s one of the most fun and challenging (and also casual) puzzle games I’ve played to this date.\n\nTrainz Trouble is a puzzle game at heart, aimed at the casual audience. Meaning anyone can pick up and play this without having to worry about difficult controls or deep mechanics. And even if it doesn’t have very deep mechanics the puzzles it throws at you are at times quite challenging. You have to be stress resistant and be able to micromanage several trains at the same time.\nIt is possible to slow down time, or even speed it up if you know exactly what you’re doing, but you’ll usually have to think things through before you even start.\nThere are 4 settings; USA, UK, Germany and Australia and each country has their own set of rules.\nUSA wants you to ride around and micromanage several trains at the same time while collecting money from the banks and blowing up rocks. UK wants you to manage the traffic while riding around. Germany wants you to avoid collisions with high speed trains and in Australia you have to pay attention to (and redirect/outrun) a faster black train.\nThe real goal is to get to the end of the station without crashing into something. You can switch railroad track directions with the press of a mouse button and if you time it right and do this correctly you won’t lose any stars at the end of the level, when you’re being rated for all of your efforts. But things aren’t really that easy. You sometimes have to time things and let trains wait before they should ride. You’re usually dealing with multiple trains. So that makes this a game that requires both reflexes and brains.\nEach of the countries has 15 levels but USA has 24 in total. But these extra levels are mostly for tutorial purposes. So in total there are 69 levels, which should be more than enough to keep you occupied for at least a couple of hours.\n\nThere’s also an in-game store that I wasn’t able to access. The button never lit up for me so I was never able to take a look at it. But there should be items in there to make things easier for you. As you can imagine I’m afraid that I can’t give you any examples here.\nThe game also has the tendency to lose focus. I’ve had several times that I could click the mouse anywhere I want and the game would not respond to it. Alt+Tab didn’t work, but restarting the game completely seemingly fixed the problem. It’s a random, but frustrating problem and I recommend that you at least do not Alt+Tab while playing because that’s one of the things that seems to break the game.\n\nGraphically Trainz Trouble still isn’t the most beautiful game out there and its graphics and style are reminiscent to the ones used in Train Town. It all looks sharp and since the game is viewed from an isometric viewpoint there’s no real need to zoom in anyway.\nIt really is a very colorful game that mixes both exaggerated and realistic models and that’s what gives it a unique look. I like it.\nIf you’ve ever been to the Big Thunder Mountain attraction in Disney Land you pretty much have an idea what the music sounds like. It sounds like hillbilly kind of music.\nThe sounds that the trains make sound realistic but not overly so and same goes for the explosions (which are fun to look at it, by the way !).\n\nTrainz Trouble is a much, much better game than Train Town and I wish I had played this one first. It’s definitely the better game between the two, even if they’re both focused on entirely different audiences. If you like casual puzzle games, or if you just like trains in general, then you can’t really pass up on Trainz Trouble. Choo choo !\n\n[Rating: 74/100]","September 5, 2014","true","1.8"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

PC  version why? I have no idea.\n\nI honestly never got to play this because it never worked on my mobile devices, and my friend kindly gifted me this game, so kudos to him.\n\nPros:\nModels and textures are quite nice, they are very cartoonized but it was done very nicely.\nEach level is pretty simple, if you played Train Crisis on mobile it's exactly the same thing\nHas no Ads unlike the Free Mobile variants\nNo need to purchase addons from the store (still has traces oddly enough)\n\nI'm not really going to explain the pros, as everything above should be straight forward enough.\n\nCons:\nMenu is slightly buggy\nHas traces of the Shop from the mobile version still there (why?)\nAudio is not optimised at all\nText was not changed from "Tap" to "Click"\nWhy does this need a PC port?\n\nAfter playing this several times, i noticed that after backing out of a world segment the menu refused to let me back into a level. I have no idea why it does this, and this will most likely not be fixed.  Oddly enough, there are a few sections where it still references the shop from the mobile version, were they that lazy to remove them?\n\nThe audio is a let down. The actual game audio isn't too bad, but the menu music is compressed as hell. It sounds atrocious. This is acceptable (for some reason) on a mobile device, but the PC version should have a nice and clear version. The text that references things such as "Tap" were never changed to "Click" for this version. This may seem like nothing, but it just shows that this is a poor port.\n\nReviewing this game is difficult, because most people might have already played this on mobile. The game is clearly a rip off of Train Crisis (even though they say "inspired", clearly a rip off), which is already available on Google's Play Store and the iOS App store. I honestly would stay in the middle with this game, but since it's steam, I need to pick one or the other.\n\nTo me, Trainz Trouble is barely a passable game for PC. It's a game that's more suited for a Tablet or Phone rather than a PC, but this version is there if you like it.","November 3, 2014","true","2.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Definitely worth the buck fifty I paid for it.  I'm not sure I would have paid more than a couple dollars though, considering how basic the game is.  Wait for it to be on sale, then nab it!\nBasically, the game amounts to this: "How many moving pieces can you manage at the same time?"  You've got trains running all over the place and you need to work the signals, throw the switches, stop the traffic, etc to make sure all of your trains arrive at the right station...without colliding, derailing, and exploding!  Some of the maps are pretty easy, but a few are quite hectic.  Overall, it's an amusing little game.\n\nP.S. I hear that this game (or something quite similar) is free on Android...but I guess that only helps if you've got a smartphone and/or don't mind gaming on a stupid 4" wide touchscreen.","December 29, 2014","true","0.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It isn't outstanding but it has nearly everything I wanted.  It didn't allow the camera angle to change or even to zoom in or out.  I would of liked some more ambient sounds.  Other than that the difficulty increases nicely and mechanics play as expected.","September 30, 2014","true","5.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Many of the later levels will need to be played dynamically, you will need to replay multiple times to work out planning so there is no sitting back and studying the rail plan until you have at least seen the trains run at least once to see where they go.  The game steps up difficulty very nicely introducing new problems as you progress through the levels.\n\nOnly downsides i found with the game is it appears to be mobile game and i felt it was overpriced for the enjoyment.  This game would be better suited to $1 or $2 market.\nThe PC port has a few issues the mouse not clicking to select the four countries available, although once you are in the game there is no problem with the mouse.  Only way i have found to resolve this is to restart the game.\nThe only other issue is some of the edge tracks do not appear on the screen which caused me issues a few times until i got used to looking more carefully.\n\nThis game is based on the Android and Apple App Game called Train Crisis so if you have the option you can check that out as a demo to ensure you like the game","April 6, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
