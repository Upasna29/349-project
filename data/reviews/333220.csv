You basicaly just click on the space bar a lot of times. But is that bad? Absolutely not. Some people may miss Cherry Tree High Comedy Club(the older game) gameplay, where you could do some random tasks,talk with poeple and walk around town, but the story is still great. If you liked the predecessor, you should buy this game. Its cheap,its kawaii,its fun,i dont know...it feels and looks nice, even with some weird bugs sometimes. Its like watching an anime.

I really love how they continue with the story.\nI also like the new characters, they make a really great combination with the characters who were already in the game.\nThe game also shows the relationships with people of all characters instead of only the main character, I am not going to spoil.. but this game really chose the right way.\n\nIf you loved the first game, you will enjoy this game even more!

I wouldn't really call this a "game," it's more of just a short book written in a game format.

This time it's a kinetic visual novel. The plot this time around is that the club is now formed and a pop idol has decided to transfer into Cherry Tree to follow her lifelong dream of comedy. It's more or less a slice of life anime in visual novel form. It's cute & well written overall. I was able to read through it in just under 2 hours. If you're a slow reader then this will probably take around 3. It definitely does not overstay its welcome. I also love how the game is split up into "Main Episodes" & "Sub Episodes". If you just want to read the main plot and avoid any sort of side story or filler you can easily. Sub Episodes pop up after every chapter or two and you can read them if you wish. They don't effect the main plot in any way and are just cute little scenes to break up the main plot. I loved how they handled it.\n\nIf I were to have any complaints it's that there is no way to view previously read text, save mid chapter or set the game at any resolution besides 640x480 (Windowed or Fullscreen). The steam overlay also doesn't seem to work either. It's nothing serious and it barely hurts the game at all!

Then is this the game for you! It takes place right after the ending of the first game, introduces a few new characters, and basically ends right when things are getting interesting. Mairu or Mary or Marino or whatever the hell her name is finally has the club up and running, but still has to deal with finding her one true comedy partner. Meanwhile, Ai Fujino, an ordinary girl by day and Japan's most famous pop idol by night, moves to town with the goal of joining aforementioned comedy club. Anime ensues.\n\nMy final verdict is that if you liked the first game (or at least liked the characters) and want to see more, you'll most likely enjoy this. Not sure if the usual asking price is worth it (the game is short, I was done long before the final card dropped), but having gotten it on sale I can say I have no regrets. I give this an awkward thumbs up. Like, pretend my hand is waving a little so my thumb dips sideways occasionally and I'm saying "eehhhhh" while I do it.","December 31, 2015","true","2.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Girls! continues the story of <insert name of whatever version you happened to play the first time around, then replace it with the original Japanese installment. Having the original Westernized version launch on steam for the prior game with the optionto use both, then scaling back to this version is the first strike. Secondly, the game isn't a game, its a visual novel, you watch episodic content and press enter, no choices, no exploration and no gameplay, unlike its predecessor which offered all of the aforementioned. The game is also extremely short with the content lasting only a couple hours and ends inconclusively unlike the first game. The only redeeming quality is that it does continue the story of the characters, and they stick to their formula, albeit the writting this time around is cliche.

It is a story about what happened after the Cherry Tree High Comedy Club (CTHCC) got founded (in the previous installment).\nI liked the storyline, and I also liked how some new characters have been introduced. You'll get to know a little bit more about all the members of CTHCC.\n\nPlease note that this is a visual novel - a story. You can watch the main chapters one by one, and you can watch them again later if you want. Also, side chapters (sub chapters) will be unlocked at several points in the main storyline. But - and this is a difference with the first installment - you do not make any choices in this game. It is just a story.\n\nWhat I also like is that they have tried to stay true to the original Japanese context: even though all the text is in English, they did not do an overhaul to typical American things. It still has the authentic Japanese feeling.\n\nEspecially for the relatively low price, it is not a bad game (read: story) to buy, even though it normally takes you only 2 or 3 hours to complete it (watch all the chapters).\n\nWhat they could do better, though, is add an easier way to quit the game: the only way I could find to stop it, is by pressing Alt-F4. With Alt-Enter you can toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode. I preferred the fullscreen mode, but that is just a personal preference.\n\nFinally, while watching the chapters, I was hoping that I would see the CTHCC actually perform an act on stage for a live audience. The game stops before this point. I can certainly understand why they did that, though. This way a third game can be added to the storyline, and perhaps you can make choices in that game that will determine how well they will do on their performance. But we'll have to wait for that.\n\nI recommend this game, but I also want to say that you should have played the first game (Cherry Tree High Comedy Club) at least once successfully (or seen a Let's Play of it somewhere) in order to fully understand some of the scenes in this sequel.","January 13, 2015","true","3.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

To this end they repurpose the games previous graphical engine to a simple graphical novel. And in that novel Mairu fights yet another scheme of her eternal rival and has to successfully lead her new club to find her one true partner.\nThat being said, this novel delivers on its promise to spin the tale further, but regretably ends on a cliffhanger and right in the middle of the whole story. Even the idea of Ai Mai Girls is left hanging in the air. This is not well done, especially with the title being Ai Mai Girls! The story feels dropped off, not as if a chapter is closed at least. If there is no part 3 to this storyline it will leave a sour taste for every reader. But even if there is a third installment, the long wait might hurt the story overall, as there was no closure to build on, having the chance to feel like a delayed DLC in the end.\n\nI propose getting this if you liked the game and enjoy reading in general. But if you want closure for your heroes, you might want to either end on the main game or wait for part 3. Thus, this review is entirely neutral. By lack of a neutral option, I go for buy it if you really liked the story of the game and only then.","October 30, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead of being a management scheduling... thing, this is a VN with several small little "episodes" that will take little more than two hours to finish. A few new characters are thrown in, but mostly it is the same people you met in CTHCC.

If you did, then this will probably be a silly little read. If not, then you would probably be best giving this one a pass.

I was a tad disappointed, but the characters and their interactions made it all worth it. All the characters were out in full force, and since you dont have to recruit everyone theres much more CHARACTER behind them.\nWhere the previous game made me feel as though I had missed a game in the beginning, this game opens right up from where the last one left off, and it continues its writing very well. In all honestly, the gameplay elements from the last game actually took away from the writing, and it shines through more than ever in this installment.\nUnfortunately, the same looping music returns, and the whole VN plays out like a sequel hook (which it is), so you wont be very satisfied with the ending as it is.

Expectations of a short entertaining interactive story.  I got more than I bargained for on short however.  Clocking in at just over an hour for the main story for a fast reader, this novel manages to be even more condensed than the original.  The extra chapters however, are nice and add another 40 minutes of content.  The actual story is good, but feels much narrower.  If I was to compare to the original with its interaction of seven characters and supporting cast, I! My! Girls! has a cast of four and support.  While not an issue in itself, it still pushes me towards the not recommended conclusion.  Storywise it is very similar to the original.  It stills has the charm and humor, but seems to be lacking in direction.  No goal to overcome here.  The biggest surprise for me though is the complete lack of interaction.  This title is now a kinetic visual novel.  No choice beyond which chapter to read and no gameplay whatsoever.  I would stick to the original unless you just absolutely love the story and characters and need more of them.\n\nPros:\n+Art design - Just as good as the original; still love the look of this series.\n+Bonus chapters - I enjoyed them more than the main story.\n\nMeh:\n~Characters - While I still like the characters, I feel they whiffed a bit on execution.\n~Music - More of the same.  Nothing wrong, nothing noteworthy.\n~Translation - Not sure what happened here, they seem to have skimmed over some localization of Japanese terminology here and there.  Might be oversight, might be me missing something.  Nothing breaks down and I am not docking the game for it, just odd...\n\nCons:\n-Short - And I mean short.  For me 65 mins for the main story and 35 mins for the bonus chapters.  Compounded by...\n-Gameplay - Or the lack thereof.  Now I am not opposed to visual novels, however I did not expect it to lack all interaction when coming from the original.  There is no value in playing/reading CTHIMG more than once.  A real shame considering I did enjoy the time management and exploration in CTHCC.\n-Graphics - Same gripe as prior game, no resolution options and fullscreen stretches.\n\nTL;DR - A somehow shorter followup kinetic novel to CTHCC that is only for major fans of the characters/story.\n\nNote: My playtime beyond 1hr 40min is trading card idle time.","December 9, 2015","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to say that you should expect a totally new story that would blow people's minds, but if you just want to read something without the demand for a totally original plot, I'd say it's not a bad purchase. (I started reading the sequel first though before "Comedy Club" because the sequel had a lower rating, so I bought the complete pack just so I can slowly warm up to all the plots. Besides, who is unfamiliar with stories being told in non-chronological orders?)\n\nEvery soundtrack in the game was surprisingly catchy. Weirdly better than a lot of soundtrack music from other visual novel games I listened to, even better than soundtracks that most animes use (Depends on what other people do watch). I even wish the developers were selling the complete soundtrack album so I could buy it and play the songs while in a way, showing support for the producers.\n\nThe artstyle is pretty. It's a nice tough that I can look at characters move around, while there are zoomed-in versions of them with clear emotions.\n\nOne downfall with this game is the fact that I can't backlog the dialogues so everytime I space-bar to the next line without paying attention, I feel like I may be missing something critical to the story. But it's been made up by the fact that the episodes are divided up so you can selected which chapters to read from if something feels incomplete. And to the end of the story, it didn't seem like I missed anything anyways.\n\nAnother downfall is that the game is locked to 640x480, so it was just a tiny bit pixelated when I was playing the game in full screen, but that didn't bother me too much.\n\nOverall, it's a generic novel, but I didn't care. I wanted to read something, dammit. The words I've been reading all the way were engaging.
