Not only is slow, repetitive and boring: it's also flawed to its core mechanics. The levels are so small that enemies spawn on top of you. All you can do is walk in a small circle while shooting the enemies chasing you. Is the art interesting at least? No, just MS paint sprites. The story? No story is revealed to the player. The music? Gets annoying after half a minute.\n\nIt seems the developer didn't even bother trying the game him/herself: looking at all the screenshots provided in the store page at the moment of posting this review, you can see how ALL of them have the same amount of gold "99991601" which is many orders of magnitude higher than what you get playing the game. How did the dev go through many levels without gaining or losing gold and achieving such an incredible quantity of coins? Obviously because he/she cheated for the sole purpose of taking the screenshots without having to actually play this pile of sh*t.\n\nThis game has no redeeming elements and could be a contender of "worst game on Steam". It's a shame this is being sold, even if it was for just 1 cent.\n\nBut that's not all, it gets even worse: this game has "Mostly Positive" reviews, with 72% of 148 reviews being positive. How could this happen? Simple, because free keys were given in exchange for positive steam reviews. Something obvious when you start looking and reviews like the following appear:\n\nRecommended\n0.8 hrs on record\nPosted: 12 January\nI get this game from the random key :D.

If you try to play this game straight through, you might notice that the first level starts out decently tough. Everything is a little rough around the edges, but if things keep going this way, it might almost be sort of fun, but probably not. Then you come to the second level, which is impossible. The rest of the game consists of an endless grind of the same levels and bosses in order to collect the coins necessary to power up your armor and weapons so that you can beat the next level. It's tiresome, boring, and there isn't a single thing about it that's worth the time and effort it requires of the player. If there's anything good to be said about Invasion, it's that if you really give it a chance, it's all over in two hours.","November 8, 2015","false","1.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

The path to success is fairly simple:\n- somehow get to stage 5 and beat the first boss\n- repeat unless you have 900 cash and get rocket launcher\n- now, with rocket launcher, beating boss from stage 5 is simpler as it takes about 30 seconds in contrast to above 2 minutes with starting pea shooter, even after upgrades\n- repeat unless you get one or two rocket and armor upgrades\n- go up to level 10 and beat boss from this level\n- repeat level 10 until you get this 3500 cash gun and until you can upgrade it to the max level\n- if you have this Laser Stick upgraded to the max level then you can go up to level 20 and beat the game with ease, buying armor upgrades from time to time\n\nAlso - 5 trading cards, who-wee.\n\nIn conclusion - just don't bother.

You have to grind the first and second stages several times just to realistically make it into the 3rd stage and beyond. There are no options for controlling the sound and enemies can literally spawn underneath you. Don't bother with this game.","May 20","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not very fun, and this is compounded by the fact that the weapons are ridiculously expensive. 1/10\n\nUpdate: It's kinda fun if you modify the files to give you 99999 coins at the beginning so you can buy max weapons and armor. I still don't like it but I got it out of a steam pack so what can I say?\nEven laser gun has an annoying blindspot\n2.5/10","May 30","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Still I enjoy playing and trying to beat it.","June 3","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
