Not because I'm a big fan, but During my time playing it, it really hits home.\n\nFirst of all, the game is very different from the previous two. There is only one animatronic. Now you may think that is easy.  Come on, like only one? While this is technically true, there are the other animatronics (in the form of hallucinations), like I've seen Foxy, Chica, BB, etc., that act as distractions by jumpscaring you, so that mister new guy can say hello.\n\nSecond of all, the new defense system isn't very obvious, which I like. There are two main defenses (at least I think), which is the audio system (consisting of BB's HI's HELLO's and HAHAHA's) , and the ventellation grates. The audio is used to lure the new guy away from you and the ventellation is used to block certain vents so he can't crawl through them, one of these leading straight to your office, which can allow for some new strategies on how to survive the nights.\n\nThird of all, is the atmosphere. I never feel safe when I play this game, dreading that something will be jumping in my face. In the game, there is a big wide window in front of you, in which is implemented greatly, as sometimes you can see Freddy limping to your door, to the new guy staring at you, then dashing away, even to him peaking at you while trying to stay hidden. It reflects the game's mood, which is what I like the most.\n\nIn general, I believe that this game is the creepiest game in the trilogy, offering new scares, more stress for you to get over, and new secrets to discover.\n\nP.S: Things that I look forward to;\n- Golden Freddy (if he exists)\n- The Custom Night (1/20 or more...)\n\n\nUpdate:\nI've done some research, and I think I can confirm that there is no custom night which makes sense (you only got SpringTrap really) but thats fine as there are a lot of secrets that makes me keep searching for them. Also I don't know if Golden Freddy exists or not.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the comments!\n\n\nAnother Update:\nGolden Freddy does exist in this game. Just search it up on youtube!","March 2, 2015","true","3.8"," 2,110 of 2,521 people (84%) found this review helpful 268 people found this review funny","84","110","2","268","91"

Distract the animatronic by using your audio equipment.\n2. Make sure to watch ventilation system. However do not worry about checking it like you would the regular cameras. You will hear when an animatronic is up above you and that is when you should check.\n3. Reboot your audio, cameras, and ventilation system as soon as it is malfunctioning.\n4. Look out for animatronic hallucinations. If you stare at any, then get ready for a jump scare. What’s worse is if you see Marionette, it will prevent you from doing anything until it decides to go away.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deriaz/recommended/354140/","Deriaz","Deriaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deriaz/","419 products in account","Hello? Hello...?? Well, if you're hearing this... You're probably wondering why there's a 3rd game already. "Does Scott even sleep?" Relax, this is last time you'll see this game.\n\nProbably. (EDIT 4/27/15: Well... I did say probably, you know. I want to get off Mr. Fazbear's Wild Ride.)\n\nWelcome to the future! Specifically, about 30 years into the future. Freddy Fazbear's is no more, its legacy diminished to a cheap horror attraction at an amusement park, set to open in one week. And hey, lucky you, you're part of the attraction. You'll be starring as... The security guard! So let's get some things straight, help you get settled in.\n\nFive Nights 3 is a different form of horror than the first two games. The first game preyed upon a feeling of helplessness. The second game used panic as a vehicle for fear. This game uses the concept of struggle and strategy to out-wit your killer, as best you can in a game this limited. There's only one animatronic, so you only have one major threat to look out for. Assuming you can find him. But be careful -- there's something in the air. You're not just dealing with Springtrap here.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar. You know the deal by now, I'd wager: Cameras to monitor where Springtrap is. But now, instead of doors or a mask to keep you safe, you have systems to maintain: Audio, camera, and ventilation. These are old systems, in order to keep authenticity, and they will break. This forces you away from the cameras to your reboot menu, where you'll spend agonizing seconds not only regaining order, but losing track of where Springtrap has gone. And heaven forbid you look away from your cameras at the wrong time, linger too far away from them, or even stare at them for too long.\n\n"How do you avoid him?" It's fairly simple, if perhaps not obvious at first -- your cameras are tied to the speaker system, allowing you to play sounds in various rooms. You also have the ability to seal vents. Springtrap wants you, but he's not the most focused individual in the world. If you do well, Springtrap won't even be a threat. Do poorly, and, well... I'm not implying that you'll die, but...\n\nHowever, with that said, this is probably the easier of the Five Nights games, just a little bit behind Five Nights 1. This game's purpose, rather than challenging you as nights progress (though it still will try!), is to wrap up the story of Five Nights at Freddy's. "What story?" If you haven't been following the story of the murdered children, the bite of '87, the Golden Freddy suit, the "Purple Guy", or even been listening to the calls, there's not too much depth here. I won't spoil anything, but there's some closure to the trilogy. If you know nothing of the previous game's happenings, this game will at least give you some sort of closure by itself, but it definitely caters to players who have played all 3 games and invested themselves in it.\n\nIf you liked the first two games, you'll like this. If you didn't, you might not, though I will say it's definitely the highest production quality of all three games. If you didn't enjoy the previous games, the increased quality may be appealing on its own if you see it on sale, as long as you remember that the core gameplay itself still remains to watch cameras.\n\nSo if that interests you, hop in! Get all nice and suited up. Just make sure not to breathe on anything that might look unsafe, and just remember:\n\nIt's all in your head.\n\n(Edits: Re-wording and typos.)","March 6, 2015","true","1.6"," 636 of 779 people (82%) found this review helpful 271 people found this review funny","82","636","779","271","12"

This series has been notorious for its fast sequels (or prequels) and recently the rumoured last installment of the series has finally come out.\n\nSo, this review will answer one question: Is Five Nights at Freddy's 3 actually scary or just a jumpscare fest?\nLong Description on the Game (Look below for a summary):Five Nights at Freddy's 3 has a completely different gameplay from its predecessors. The only gameplay mechanics that remain are winning at 6 AM and the office and cameras. Other than that, nearly everything has been removed and/or changed. In Five Nights at Freddy's 3, there is a control panel where you can monitor the status of systems like Ventilation and such. These systems will randomly go offline and cause your death as most of them are required to stop the animatronic from reaching you. You can now play a sound in the cameras to lure the animatronic away from you, although the system errors might mess you up and cause your death. Cameras are now more staticy and the animatronic isn't as visible anymore in the cameras. This causes the user to rapidly search for where the animatronic is and strikes fear into their hearts. Five Nights at Freddy's 3 is no longer a reflex game unlike the second installment. It, however, still keeps your heart pumping.\nLosing causes a jumpscare however this is not why it is scary. Most of the time when I was playing, I was panicking and getting scared due to losing track of where the animatronic went. Not only that, this animatronic can peek through the windows of the Office. The animatronic can walk past the window and run past you. There are, also, hallucinations of the animatronics from the previous games and they cause a jumpscare and system failure. Some people might call this a cheap way to scare the user but it really isn't scary anymore after the first few times. The reason they are there is to cause system failures in a different way (other than them randomly going out). To me, this was executed in the best way possible.\n\nSummary:\nPros:- New scary and dark atmosphere due to the pizzeria being abandoned.\n- MUCH better jumpscares (These are NOT the reasons why the game is scary)\n- Hallucinations of characters from the previous games\n- Story is finally nearly pieced together\n- Brand new gameplay mechanics\n- Completely different from the earlier games\n- No longer a reflex game (unlike the second installment)\n- Animatronic isn't easily visible in cams (causing player to panic)\n- Multiple cam sections (Normal and Vents)\n- A brand new extras menu\n- Cheats\n- A window where animatronic(s) can walk past and stare\n- Bigger Office\n- Freddy's Nose\n\nCons:- Animatronic can sometimes "teleport" from one end of the cam to the office\n- Hallucinations might bug sometimes\n- You will not understand the story if you have not played the previous games\n- Gameplay mechanics can be confusing at first\n\nOverall:Therefore, to me, Five Nights at Freddy's 3 is not a jumpscare fest and is by far the best horror game in the series. It is also a good indie horror game that is actually pretty cheap.\nYou should pick it up if you are looking for a good horror game or are a fan of the series.","March 13, 2015","true","6.5"," 193 of 238 people (81%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","81","193","238","29","7"

A heart-racing, typically challenging strategic horror game like no other that I've seen. Eager to play, I minded little about the quickness of the game's launch in relativity to its predecessor.\n\nThe story has much depth, cleverly and subtly implemented. I am personally sad to see the series at its potential end, although we never know if there could be a fourth in the upcoming future.\n\nA good strategy for those struggling with the later nights 4, 5 and 6:\n\n- Keep an eye on Springtrap in his current position\n- Should he leave the room, press the "Play audio" button and he will return to it almost immediately\n- Repeat as often as possible, rebooting audio and ventilation when needed\n- Reboot camera when needed, but prioritize audio and ventilation\n- Don't "Reboot all" often unless needed. This uses a lot of time and gives Springtrap time to catch you in your office.\n\nHope this helped.","March 6, 2015","true","5.7"," 222 of 287 people (77%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","77","222","287","42","5"

I kid you not, I actually shed a tear of relief when the clock ticked over to 6:00 AM on Night 6.\n\nTo do the game justice, I'm rewriting my recommendation now that I've completed everything that the game seems to offer, but I'll include the original recommendation in a comment in the description if you're interested in reading some of my first impressions on it.\n\nSo, would I recommend it? Hell yes. It was incredibly satisfying working to get a grasp of all the mechanics, but the game still has a huge element of unpredictability, so even when you think you'll be able to pull of the hardest challenges it offers, you may still end up short. It is this feeling of utter helplessness at times that makes it such a good horror experience, and I think FNaF 3 manages to capture this to an even greater extent than either of the first two games.\n\nIf you're new to the Freddy experience, this should be a pretty interesting and wild ride for you, but I would honestly recommend that you start from the beginning of the series or at least watch a playthrough on YouTube, as you will miss out on the best parts of the overarching story as well as the subtle changes in game mechanics that are present throughout.\n\nFor the long time fans of the series, you get a lot of answers and even some closure to a lot of big plot points in here, and I won't spoil anything in writing here, but I have posted some spoilery screenshots if you have the desire to view them.\n\nUltimately, this feels like a great possible conclusion for the FNaF franchise, which it might very well be, but rumors are plentiful everywhere you look, so we'll just have to see what Scott does. Either way, if this is the end or not, I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and I honestly believe the FNaF-series is a milestone in the horror genre that won't be easily forgotten.\n\nIf you're still sticking around, thanks a lot for reading, and take care!\n\n-Kelso","March 4, 2015","true","6.4"," 255 of 346 people (74%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","74","255","346","38","4"

I believe that Scott took his time, and made it quite well. Some people believe that it's "milked", but I believe it was pretty good.\n\nThe pros!\n- You probably expected this, but it's pretty scary.\n- Still the usual 2D engine, but with a more improved 3D "illusion".\n- Which adds a new mechanic: Hallucinations! In the other games, hallucinations were flashing pictures, but these are "phantom" animatronics that appear on camera when your vent system goes out, making you breathe heavy, and leads to those...\n- MULTIPLE ENDINGS! I won't spoil anything, but there are 3.\n- MANY new minigames.\n- Lots of new stuff I can't name!\n\nThe neutral:\n- The clock goes much faster, making the nights go faster, but the difficulty is risen, so it's kinda balanced.\n\nThe cons:\n- Springtrap's jumpscare is pretty pathetic...\n- This is personal, but the sense of panic you get from seeing things in the hall and turning to see them while in your camera... Gets my heart pumping.\n\nIn my opinion, out all 3 Five Nights at Freddy's games, this might be the best, close with the first one.\n\nFINAL RATING: 9/10","March 4, 2015","true","9.5"," 189 of 276 people (68%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","68","189","276","20","5"

After five months of waiting, the third, and most likely the final, installment to the highly acclaimed Five Nights at Freddy's saga has been released. I was well into the hype as soon as the first teasers popped up on Scottgames.com, and was one of the very few people that waited patiently for the release. Yeah, I will be honest, the community kinda sucks when it comes to being patient. Granted, there are people who respect Scott's wishes to take his time to make a quality game, but there are still people that are not afraid to badger the poor guy. But, I digress.\n\nAnyway, FNaF 3 is likely the most hyped up game in the entire series. Not only did it take more time than FNaF 2 in terms of development, but it also promised a lot of major changes to the gameplay as a whole, as well as the story. Speaking of which, FNaF 3 takes place 30 years after the events of Five nights 1 and 2 (which automatically clears up timeline discussions, thank god), and is instead in the halls of a horror attraction. Scott Cawthon reprises his role as the phone guy, who is now a more modernised individual, and also a different individual altogether. Don't worry, fans of original Phone Guy, for he also makes a return. How? Through pre-recorded audio tapes that are meant to teach pizzeria employees how to use the spring loaded hybrid suits, which are designed to be human suits and animatronic suits. This ties in to our new enemy, Spring Trap, who lurks the halls on night two and onward (night 1 is a freebie level that talks you through using the different mechanics, which I'll go through in a moment).\n\nNow, the fact that there is only one main enemy will make the game sound really easy. However, Scott has once again pulled some clever tricks out of his sleeves. For starters, you can now access two parts of the building: the main halls and the vents. In the main halls, you can play audio in any room to lure Spring Trap away from you or a vent. In the vents, you can seal any ONE vents to prevent Spring from going through it. That's right, only one, so it's best to be wise when choosing a vent to seal. Of course, with all of this stuff, it would make the game even easier, if not for the reboot system. The vents, audio, and even the CAMERAS can and will break down at certain times and under certain conditions. In order to fix these issues, you have to reboot that system through a menu on the left part of the screen. When rebooting any and all systems, you cannot access cameras or exit from the reboot menu, leaving you open for attack, so be sure to wait until the right moment.\n\nOkay, okay, now this may seem like it would still be easy, but I'm only just getting to the good part. Our favorite animatronics make a surprising return, but not as animatronics that kill you. Instead, they will randomly come to your office as hallucinations, or phantoms as they're called in-game, and jump at you, causing you to be temporarily blinded and causing your vents to break, meaning Spring has an easy window to come and get you.\n\nThe animatronics are not the only returning element. The death minigames from FNaF 2 also come back, but not after you die. Rather, they appear in between levels, telling you the story of the birth of Spring Trap. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but trust me when I say that the twist at the end is more than unsettling, combined with the ending overall.\n\nUpon completing the main campaign, you get three different replay incentives. For one, there are two different endings to the game itself. The bad ending is what you get if you play the game normally, but the good ending is quite a tricky devil to unlock. You'd likely be better off searching it on Youtube once you beat the game, since the ending cutscene doesn't change either way. Secondly, you get Nightmare mode, which is, rather disappointingly, the hardest mode in the game. It's not disappointing in a sense that it's easy or anything, but it means that there is no seventh custom night, unless there is one in the extras area, which is the third item you unlock after beating night 5. Extras mode lets you see the sprites and jumpscares of the animatronics, as well as hidden minigames and cheats. I'm not yet certain if one of the cheats includes the custom night mode, as I haven't unlocked that portion yet (cheats and jumpscares are unlocked via beating Nightmare Mode), but we should find out very soon.\n\nOverall, this game is easily one of my favorites from this year, as well as my favorite in the series. It may not be as content filled as the first or second game, or even as scary (though the phantoms did get me a few times), I still find FNaF 3 to be a worthy follow up, as well as a great way to end a great franchise (and yes, I KNOW that it's foolish of me to jump the gun on that statement, but honestly, there's enough red flags in this game to show that this is at least the last game for a WHILE). I'll be honest, while I will happily follow whatever Scott makes in the future, I hope he at least takes a break from thsi franchise. Great games or not, three games consecutively in just one year could take a lot out of even the most skilled developers. I wouldn't know, since I've never made a game (though I am considering making a FNaF fangame just to get familiar with Clickteam Fusion, which is the engine used in this series), but I can imagine that it's hard work. Either way, to Scott if he somehow finds and reads this, do whatever you want to do. From what I've seen, you have a passion for making games, and you're certainly a person I've been looking up to. Whether you decide to make Five Nights at Freddy's 4: Electric Boogaloo, or even make another ip in the horror genre, I look forward to whatever you make.\n\nAlso, on a final note, try the mobile version if you're interested. After playing the demo for a little bit, I find that version to be a bit easier to get into than the PC version, at the cost of not having as many features of course.","March 21, 2015","true","1.9"," 63 of 85 people (74%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","74","63","85","11","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeF/recommended/354140/","SkyeF","Flutter Skye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeF/","413 products in account","Five Nights at Freddy's 3 is the possibly final installment in the Five Nights at Freddy's Franchise,\nAnd it's possibly the best one. This game, unlike the first 2 games, gives you an actual reason to check the cameras, because it's your only line of defense.\nThis time you don't have any fancy Freddy Fazbear Mask, or power-taking doors. All you depend on is the camera.\nSpringtrap, the main Animatronic in Five Nights at Freddy's, is the only animatronic you'll see here. He's the only one left. He will hide on the camera feeds, forcing you to spend some time on each camera, trying to find where he currently is.\nYou probably want to know how to defend against him, it's easy. You have to use the Audio Devices (Which use Balloon Boy's soundbox for some reason) on a room adjacement to the one he's currently in. You probably think now "Oh, so I'll just stay on a single camera and keep on using the Audio Devices there" That isn't possible.\nIn this game, we have the Maintenance Panel, it allows us to reset the various systems in the game, which happen to glitch out as the night goes on.\nHere's how they work:\nVentilation - If it stops working, you'll have problems breathing, and you vision will black out every few seconds, making you defenseless against Springtrap, if he's near you.\nVideo - When you use the camera too much, it will occasionally glitch out, and the whole camera monitor will be covered in static, making you unable to find Springtrap.\nAudio Devices - The more you use the Audio to lure Springtrap away, the more often it will glitch out, making you unable to use it until you reset it. It also makes Phantom BB appear, but I'll get to that later.\nThe Maintenace panel allows us to either reset the ventilation, video, or audio Devices. It also allows us to reboot all the systems at once, but there's also a bad thing about it. It takes quite some time to reboot a system, allowing Springtrap to get closer to you, and end your night.\n\nA good thing about this game, is that Springtrap doesn't have a linear path to you. You never know where he will go, making you nervous that you won't find him, and he will end your night quite soon.\nThere are also vents, they serve as shortcuts for Springtrap to get you quicker, but don't worry, you're still able to defend against that. If you hear a sound cue of something moving in the vents, you have to quickly switch to the Vent View, and find Springtrap there, quickly. If you don't seal the vent quickly, the night will become quite harder.\n\nAlright, you wonder how scary this game is? It gives the most tension so far. Springtrap might seem scary, or not scary for you (I personally do find him quite scary) However, I'm gonna tell you that someone's corpse is inside him. Yes, a human skeleton is inside him. Someone got trapped inside him, and died. Just thinking about it gives me the chills.\nThe Phantom Animatronics are different though. They're not real, it's all in your mind. Here I'll describe them, and say how much I find them scary.\nPhantom BB - His face will randomly appear on a camera, staring at you. If you won't quickly switch the camera, he will appear in the office and jumpscare you. [I personallly find "him" the most scary Animatronic in this game. Whenever I see him on the camera, out of nowhere, I always get scared, and because of that I get jumpscared by him, doing a scary combo. I'd rate him a 9/10.\nPhantom Mangle - Will appear on CAM 04, replacing Foxy's head. She will cause a loud, static sound, disable the Audio Devices, and peek through the window. [It manages to scare me by a surprise of seeing her instead of Foxy, and the loud, creepy-static audio. 8.5/9\nPhantom Freddy - He will slowly move past the window, looking at you http://i.imgur.com/pWnuG06.png If you'll just look at him, and not use the Monitor or the Maintenance Panel, he will jumpscare you. [Whenever you see him moving just past the window, it gives a sense of fear. And then he just dissapears, hides to the ground, just to say hello using a jumpscare a few moments later. I love this one, but one thing that dissapoints me, is that you barely get attacked by him, because you don't have a reason to look at the window for more than a second. I give him a 9/10\nPhantom Puppet - Appears on CAM 08 randomly, not switching the camera will make him appear in front of you, making you unable to do anything for 7-10 seconds. [Well, I find him pretty creepy. His eyes looking at you, accompanied with the sound he makes, is just horrifing (At least for me) I'd rate him a 8.5/10. If you want to see how he works, here's a reproduction I made: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/81657508/FFFF/FNaF%203/puppet.html\nPhantom Chica - If you see a white, smiling face on the Arcade, on CAM 07, it means you have summoned her. Moving to the left side of the office will trigger her jumpscare. [This one was made incredibly well. When you see the face, you have no idea what's going on. Later on you want to check the Maintenance Panel, and she just jumpscares you, out of nowhere. But there's something bigger here, because if you see her on the Arcade, she will not always jumpscare you. You never know if she will do, or no not. 9/10\nPhantom Foxy - Randomly appears on the left side of the office, jumpscares you. [You never know when he will be there, he's completely random. You can defend against him by putting the monitor on and off, it will make him dissapear. Though I think it would be better if he would also sometimes appear on the right side of the office. He gets a 8.5\n\n\nThere are also the Atari Minigames, which show what happened in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, and tell who is our new Animatronic and explain the lore.\nSo in other words:\nPros:\n+ Game gives you a big reason to check the cameras\n+ The game balances the pressure, jumpscares, luck, and skillful management correctly.\n+ The models are extremely well made, looking the best in the FNaF series\n+ Possibly the scariest one in the series\n+ A lot of new mechanics, executed in a good way\n+ Multiple Endings\n+ Explains a lot of the lore\n+ Freddy's nose still honks after 30 years\n+ The fan is still here.\n\nCons:\n- Main Character isn't very scary\n- Freddy barely plays any role\n- A little repeative in certain aspects.\n\n\n\n\nI personally think it deserves a 8/10 rating, it's a very good game (and my favorite one in the FNaF series) but certain things could have been executed a lot better.\nKeep in mind that this whole review is just my personal opinion on the game.","March 9, 2015","true","28.6"," 147 of 230 people (64%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","64","147","230","11","5"

To survive each night you must use balloon boys recorded voice to trick Springtrap (the animatronice) into thinking there's a child in the room you use the audio in. You must also check the airvents when you hear a thumping noise so you can seal the vent that Springtraps in. This makes the game sound easy but when you use the audio it takes a little while before you can use it again. There is also a thing called the maintanence panel which youu have to use if you use the audio to many times(so the audio system fails), the camera system fails or the ventalation fails. The maintanance panel is almost the equivelent of the music box from the second game. It takes a long time to reboot each system giving Springtrap a chance to come into your office. If the audio fails and you don't reboot it there will be nothing to lead Springtrap away from your office, if the camera systems fail and you don't reboot them all you'll see is static when you look at the cameras so you won't know where springtrap is and if the ventalation fails your charecter's vision will keep flashing black if you don't reboot the system. Although technecly there's only one animatronice there are also hallucinations of some of the animatronices from the previous games, the hallucinations can't actually kill you but they can jump scare and disable the ventalation or audio.\n\nI reckon Scott Cawthon has done a great job and i highly recommend the game!","March 17, 2015","true","6.3"," 51 of 73 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","51","73","5","3"

The owners of the attraction are attempting to"revive the legend"from almost 40-60 years ago or so and give an authentic as possible experience to patrons.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly the same as the other 2,you play to try and survive for 5 nights,but there's one difference right off the bat: There's only 1 animatronic,the Springtrap.\n\nWhile there is only one animatronic,sometimes(especially after night 2)one of the older animatronics(excluding the toy animatronics from 2)appears in a hallucination,that can cause one of your systems to go out: Audio systems(BB audio that you can use to distract Springtrap),Camera Systems,and Ventilation(You can close the vents if Springtrap gets in the vents/to prevent him getting in the vents)\nThe hallucinations in this game(especially when I first encountered them)were downright terrifying(especially Marionette/Puppet),tho the Springtrap was hardly scary to me after already seeing his jumpscare in the teaser(not a huge deal tho)\n\nIn between each night there's these minigames(like the death minigames from 2)that reveal a TON of the story(and in a way as the ending shows,brings it to a close),which I think was a really good idea :)\n\nInstead of having a night 6 and something/20 mode(or as I like to call it,Extreme Mode),there's a night called"Nightmare", which is the 6th night but also the official last night/hardest difficulty in the game.\n\nIn addition to the main game and Nightmare,there's this good ending you can get by getting certain secrets/completing certain secret minigames,which I still have yet to do at the time of writing this.\n\nAnd once you've done all of that and completed the game,there's this extra menu that lets you look at the different animatronics and their jumpscares,and even gives you access to a few cheats.\n\nOverall,this is probably my favorite in the series,and if the rumors are true and the series is over as of this game,I congratulate Scott Cawthon for making an amazing game series <3\n\n11/10 from me :)\n(UPDATE Mar 9,2015: beat Nightmare :),now onto the complicated stuff with the good ending)\n(UPDATE Mar 11,2015: got the good ending)\n(UPDATE May 8,2015: scottgames.com Five Nights at Freddy's 4 officially confirmed,keep checking the link for new teasers,I already found one new one with...whatever it is o.o,and also as of now there is a 4th star you can get for beating Nightmare with the Aggressive cheat on,which I will try to do :) )","March 6, 2015","true","28.8"," 92 of 144 people (64%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","64","92","144","14","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RottyTopaz/recommended/354140/","RottyTopaz","ShottySnowpaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RottyTopaz/","100 products in account","Okay, I'm going to get straight to point here. I don't think that FNaF 3 is very good, ot atleast as good as the previous games. Now before you all downvote and leave and angry comment let me explain.\n\nI actually liked the first 2 FNaF games, I didn't find either of them too scary, but they were atleast fun to play, and an intresting idea. It would have been fine if the game series ended at the second one, I mean, after you remove the only means of defending yourself in the first game, and have over double the amount of animatronics, how much further can you go? Well apparentally you have one animatronic, a bunch of black things that do nothing but make you sit still for a few seconds and put the "Freddy" in the title, and sand your only defense down to an idea originally in a Five Nights at Freddy's fan game. Also, we are never told why leading him around with noises actually works.\n\nThe gameplay is basically sitting around in your office while a man who sounds like he should be starring in "Mike and Jeremy's Excellent Adventure" telling you very very vaguely what to do. But eventually you have to start making noices to lead Springtrap, the trashy looking version of bonnie, around so he doesn't touch your butt. But while doing this you're audio, camera, and ventalation systems will expierence more crashes then a blind man driving a car with 3 wheels, which forces you to sit still and reboot them for a few seconds, which leaves you open to be attacked by Springtrap. But its not only Springtrap trying to touch your butt, 5 or so of the animatronics from the 2 other games appear and jump at you, whilst squeling like a cat. These don't do much but disable one of your systems, and the only purpose they have gameplay wise as put the Freddy on the title screen. The game is basically just playing a noise, sitting around, playing another noise, rebooting your ventalation, getting screamed at by Freddy, rebooting your ventalation, playing another noise, and so on.\n\nI'm making this game out to be not frightning in the slightest, which would be wrong of me to do, as it is quite scary at first, and the first time seeing Springtrap and being jumpscared by BB and Foxy and the others is quite horrifying first time around, but just like every other game in the series, they eventually stop being scary, except in this game, it gets tired and annoying faster then any of the other two games, as you can have over 3 jumpscares in a single night. Which of course that you can no longer use the defense of "The jumpscares are a punishment for dying" as its not your damn fault when you get jumpscared by the old animatronics, it just happens, and there is little you can do it about it. Now this game can really be called a jumpscare fest.\n\nOne of my final complaints is that Springtrap himself isn't really that scary. His "jumpscare" is either A. Him walking slowly into your room, looking like a racoon about to start digging threw your trash, or B. Him slowly walking at you with this expression on his face that makes him look like a friendly neighbour, asking if you can help him get a fallen tree out of his backyard. Also, how the heck is he killing us? We're never explained why or how it kills us, for all I know he could be just coming into our office to borrow your cordless vacuum cleaner, or brag about how he makes more money working at the horror attraction then we do. And on a side note he looks radical in sunglasses.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is just incriedbly mediocre. It doesn't even have the "Hitting you in the childhood" factor that the other 2 had, by making those Chuck-E-Cheese characters that always slightly spooked you as  a kid attempt to murder you. Because Springtrap, which by the way, has a name that should belong with a cartoon cat, really doesn't closley resemble anything a normal 80's or 90's (Not really sure and can't be asked to google it) child would have seen growing up. This game just provides you with some cheap spooks for about an hour of gameplay before completley loosing everything, and unlike the other 2 I don't really find it fun to play. It's only real purpose is serving the game's overall plot, which it does quite nicely, even giving a full on end to the series, though to get that ending you need to jump threw a crapload of cryptic hoops, or else you get the "bad ending"\n\nAlso not to mention that constant crashes the game has, I spent 15 minutes trying to get Night 2 to load up without the game crashing.\nEDIT: These crashing bugs have since been fixed with a recent patch to the game, so this complaint doesn't really matter, but it still happended and impacted the game at launch, so I'm leaving it in.\n\nI know the excuse for this kind of thing is "But the devolper worked reaaalllly hard on it, plz give him some respect and more money while your at it" but thats not a valid excuse, you can't let a game pass because somebody put effort into it. At the end of the day, a devolper has screwed up. Then put his screw up on steam. Then made me pay for his screw up.\n\nScott Cawthon is clearly a talented game creator with some great ideas, and I just want him to move onto new and better things, as there is only so far you can go with this concept, and it seems the 2 games was the furthest you could go.\n\nBut thats just my opinion on the game, and if you enjoy the game then my opinion shouldn't bother you.\n\nBut regardless, I apologise for my edgy opinions on the spooky Chuck-E-Cheese game, now I'll go away.

But anyway, I really enjoyed it. It was a really good game to play, especially since it looks like the last. The game works differently in term of gameplay mechanics, No doors or Flashlights.\n\nYou have vents you can close, and 3 systems. Audio, Ventilation, and Video. If you let audio die, your sound will go crazy. If you let Ventilation die, you will hallucinate and Phantom anyone will come and scare you, and you will hear heavy breathing. If you let video die, RIP your cameras. The "New" animatronic known as SpringTrap is the only person who's killed me in-game so I'm not sure if any Phantom Animatronics can kill. You can reboot all systems, but it takes a while.\n\nIt's a good game to end a series with, if it ends the series. There are also these secret minigames you can get by doing certain things in the building, but I won't talk about those, it's kind of spoilers. You need to do all secret minigames to get the "True" ending. (Not the minigames after each night). It's really weird and I'm not sure how anyone would figure out how to get to these minigames, but I got them with the help of a guide. I reccommend this game, but you'll be sad by the end of it if you love the series.\n\nGo buy it now. You probably won't regret it unless you don't like "horror" games.\nAlso as far as I've found out C-D-+ cheat doesn't work, I tried with the squeaky nose too, cheaters.

I wish there was a "Kind of" option for Steam reviews, because this game deserves it more than anything. Five Nights at Freddy's 3 is not a bad game, heck, it's decent at times. I enjoy both games before this immensly as well, and while they weren't perfect, they were scarier than most horror games released today and had some nice lore thrown in. I had some fun with this as well, though not as much as the last games in the series. The game is more notably flawed than the last one, though, so it was a tough choice between recommend and not recommend, but I have to do the usual review nonesense before I come to that conclusion, so here we go.\n\nSTORY: You're... some guy. Unlike the last two games, the name of the character isn't revealed at the end, so as far as I know he could be anyone, so I'll just call him Mr Cameraman. The game takes place in 2023 (or 2017, not sure of exact date), and Mr Cameraman gets a job at Fazbear's Fright, a not really scary haunted house type place made to exploit the horrors at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. There could be a metaphor to describe the game in that description but I'm not gonna touch it. The manager brings in an old animatronic they found at an old Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria, and like the other games, it gets up at night and tries to kill you. It's a neat idea, though it's as well executed as the last two games's plot, which is a flat out meh. There are two endings, the first one you get if you just play normally and the second if you do some random minigames that are hidden in the game. There is pretty much no difference between them except a differing picture at the end, though, and it's about as vaguly explained as the Mass Effect 3 ending, though not even close to as bad as ME3's ending. The lore is explained a bit more... kind of, in the previously mentioned minigames, though it's incredibly vague.\n\nGAMEPLAY: It's the same basic gameplay idea as the last two games: you get a network of security cameras to observe the pizzeria's key points and to keep an eye out for the animatronics. The cameras display a lot more static and there is a bit of delay from switching from one camera to another, which I do like and I hope Scott carries this over to 4. One thing I could do without though, is the maintenance. The whole place's computer system works on Windows Vista, and as a result, everything breaks down after a while. If Audio, Video, or Ventilation breaks down, you have to exit out and repair them, which gives time for the big bad animatronic to get you. If Audio breaks down you have to repair it or else you can't lure Springtrap into other rooms, if Video breaks down you won't be able to see the cameras, and if Ventilation breaks down you start to hallucinate and crazy stuff starts to happen. While this may create tension for some, this felt more of a chore to me than anything, and since it takes FOREVER to reboot everything, it gives Springtrap plenty of time to get to your door and scream in your face if all three break down, especially on later nights.\n\nThere are no doors this time around, nor a Freddy mask to hide in. Instead, you have to use the camera systems to find Springtrap and use audio clips to lure him away from you. While this could work well, it is incredibly exploitable, and I could keep calling Springtrap into a room and keep him there for potentially the whole night. There are also vents, which Springtrap can use to either go straight into your office or right outside it. You can prevent this by closing specific parts of the vents, though you can only keep one closed at a time.  However, since the game would be lame if there was only one animatronic but Scott was too far in with developing to realize it, there are some added animatronics in there named Phantoms. They appear sometimes in the camera feed for the sole purpose to jumpscare you and make you restart your camera system. There are five nights in the usual mode, though you pretty much do nothing until Night 2, so it may as well have been 4 nights. There's another unlockable Nightmare mode after you beat campaign, which gives you a challenge if you want one. Overall it's not terrible, but the other two were much better and less exploitable.\n\nCHARACTERS: Phone Guy (once again played by Scott Cawthon) makes another appearance in here via audio clips that replace the phone calls after a while. I think Scott does a decent enough job at this, so I don't care too much about him. There is only one animatronic technically, Springtrap, who's design is one of the most badass I've ever seen so far in 2014, I give Scott major kudos there. The Phantom animatronics I named earlier are less impressive, though. You have Phantom Foxy, Chica, Freddy, Mangle, Balloon Boy, and the Puppet. Most of their designs are decent, though Balloon Boy... why the hell Scott thought Balloon Boy could be scary is a bigger question for me about this franchise than who caused the Bite of 87.\n\nOTHER THOUGHTS: So ladies and gentlemen, this is the part you've all been looking forward too. Why do I not recommend this game? It's quite simple actually, this game isn't scary at all. I got a few goosebumps from playing, but Springtrap's jumpscare is just lame and the Phantom's jumpscare are just laughable. Is that a good reason to downvote it, some of you may ask? Yes, because it's a horror game. A horror game should be scary. I wasn't scared once. That's inexcusable for a horror game. If the gameplay was fun than I could forgive that, but it's honestly too exploitable to have any fun with it. The game isn't terrible, I still had more fun with it than a decent amount of games, but it just isn't fun enough. Eight bucks for it is fair I suppose, but I say get the first game before this one, it's the better game out of the three.\n\nFINAL RATING: 5/10. It's flat out mediocre like I said earlier, at least in my opinion. I don't have any ill will towards this game, heck, I view it as a guilty pleasure more than anything, but Scott Cawthon didn't do very good with this one. I hope Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is better, I want a satisfying conclusion to this franchise. I know Scott can pull this off, he has the talent to do so. I will get Five Nights 4 when it comes out, I love these games too much to not do so.\n\nHe will come back.

I hate to be the one guy who posts a negative review but in this case, I feel it is a must. This game really isn't all that it's hyped up to be; having breezed through the first three nights, I found the game to be rather easy. If you could call the first night a legit night since there isn't any animatronics roaming at that point and you spend the first night pretty much listening to the new phone guy. The "phantom" animatronics were interesting at first but quickly lost their scare factor once you realize they don't result in a pain staking game over and they decide to stack ontop of each other. The game's jumpscares lost their teeth even more so once you realized that you could easily see when they were coming. That being said, by the time I reached night 4, I found myself more annoyed than feeling any real sense of danger.  Particularly when my systems would go offline every few seconds or multiple systems would go off at once, which in the original game, would result in death unless you were on the verge of 6AM. Whenever i'd have multiple systems go off, i'd just hit the reset all button which takes a long time. By then, I was searching the cameras to find spring trap if he hadn't already made his way into or by my office.  Now we get to spring trap's jumpscare, the only one i've seen from playing that results in death, which isn't even the least bit scary. When compared to the "phantom" jumpscares, his is pretty tame. Almost like you're eating a grilled cheese sandwhich and he's coming over cause he wants to see if you'd split it with him. Course I guess with this being the third game in the series, it's pretty much expected that it won't live up to the first two entries.","March 4, 2015","false","11.4"," 584 of 1,040 people (56%) found this review helpful 73 people found this review funny","56","584","1","73","28"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaszimir/recommended/354140/","Kaszimir","Chub T. Herb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaszimir/","128 products in account","Do you want a review of why FNAF 3 is bad without a crap load of hate remarks? You've come to the right place. (WARNING SPOILERS)\n\nSimply put, FNAF 3 fails where FNAF's 1 and 2 have prevailed\nHOWEVER, it also prevailed where 1 and 2 didn't, which will be explained towards the bottom.\nFNAF 3 has 3 major downfalls. Gameplay, Scare Factor, and overall functionality.\n\nGAMEPLAY: FNAF 3's gameplay revolves around the 1 new animatronic, being the only animatronic (aside for of course the phantom ones. Their purpose is to make you reset the ventilation and also to scare you). The problem with him is that he is never explained. Now I LOVE games where you have to figure out what you're doing, as I grew up with NES classics. HOWEVER, I have obtained 3 stars and I still do not know how he works. I have, of course, found out how certain things work, enough to (obviously) beat the game. But there is no explanation. None. You are left to scramble about, trying to survive night 3 since nights 1 and 2 its nearly impossible to die, while also trying to figure out how the thing you're trying to prevent from entering your room works. The system monitor only prevents you further from understanding how Spring Trap works. Instead of having the first night have no animatronic however still having the system menu, they should have made it the opposite, to allow time for the player to understand the ways of Spring Trap. Overall, the gameplay is too strange to go without explanation, thus confusing the player and making the game as luck based as FNAF 1 on 4/20 mode. Which, if you look at the forums, you'll find people who beat it in less than 3 hours like me (which, on its own, is ENTIRELY dissapointing) and people who cant get past night 3 even while using strategies that've worked for everyone else. It's a mess, and it needs either revision or explanation.\n\nSCARE FACTOR: You can watch any Youtuber and they'll be scared ****less. But you must understand that's their job. This game is not scary. AT ALL. In fact, the scariest thing in the game can't even kill you, as it is the phantom animatronics' jumpscare sprites. You can beat this game and look for yourself, both death animations look like Spring Trap is just like "ayyyy how goes it blargh". Remember in FNAF 1 when Freddy just goes and freaking TACKLES you in his death animation? Or in FNAF 2, when Old Bonnie takes off your mask and reaches for your neck! But in FNAF 3, the one thing that can kill you has an animation less scary than FNAF 1's Foxy, because at least that was accompanied with a horrific sound. A scary death noise or animation are both absent in FNAF 3. It is unfortunate how little this game has in the line of attempts at scaring the player. However, it is something that should not be overlooked.\n\nFUNCTIONALITY:\nOh Scott.\nOh dear dear Scott.\nYou finished this one too early my friend.\nFar too early.\nThe game has one bug. One. Bug.\nIt randomly closes upon starting a night.\nI could end the review now, but I won't. PLEASE, PLEASE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION: THIS GAME DOES NOT WORK. Sure, I beat it, many others did, and many others may not experience problems. However this isn't just a one-two person problem. This is hundreds of people who, upon starting a night, ANY NIGHT, could have the entire game shut down on them. I would be absolutely fine with this if Scott rushed a patch the next day, but here we are 2 days later and it's still V1.0. That enrages me. This really is reason enough not to buy it now, not at LEAST until it gets patched. YES, the game is playable, but the only thing more frustrating than dying on 5 AM is going to replay the night and having the game crashing on you. Then restarting the game, loading up the night, and it crashing again. This HAS HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE. I honestly do not know how this was overlooked during playtesting, but it was. And so far, nothing has come to fix it.\n\nTHE GLIMPSE OF HOPE: Now maybe you think I'm hating too much on this game. But there is one thing that FNAF 3 does right. It does it VERY right. You see, FNAF 1 EXCELLED in giving a simple, horrific experience. FNAF 2 stepped it up by adding more gameplay mechanics, and making it harder yet more rewarding as a game. FNAF 3...does none of these right. But what it DOES do right is STORY. I didn't realize upon its release that this would be the last FNAF game. But seeing the end of this game, and thus the FNAF series, it was REALLY satisfying. And not a satisfying as in YAY I BEAT IT, but really a satisfaction that can only be attained upon experiencing a very well written and ended storyline. Bear in mind, the ending does not answer all questions-but it answers a lot, and as previously stated, it is really a great feeling to see the end of it. I can not emphasize that enough.\n\nUnfortunately, the brilliantly strung story line can not replace the lack of gameplay, scares, and thorough gametesting. It pains me to say that I can not reccomend this game, although at 8 dollars, it is simply not worth it. When it goes on sale it is worth getting just to experience the story, however until then, youtube is your friend. This review is not meant to attack the game, game maker, or supporters of it, and it is just my honest opinion. I hope I made you consider the downsides of the game before purchase, but whatever you choose, just remember jumping right in isn't always worth it, as 8 dollars has gotten me 2.9 hours on a game and 3 stars. I can not say it was worth it.","March 4, 2015","false","2.9"," 239 of 432 people (55%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","55","239","432","22","17"

It's a lot easier then the other ones, and really not that scary, but at this point that's not what it's about. Since FNaF2 that's not what the series is about. Obviously people like Markiplier, and ugh, PewDiePie, are infamous players of the series, and have quite a loud mouth about it too.\n\nBut believe me, it's more than gameplay, it's a story. Each game was meant to be another part of the story. Now for my speculation, 3 is the end of the timeline.\n\n1. Kids souls are set free\n2.

Even though its really challenging.\n\nThe main goal of the game is to get the animatonic (Springtrap) away from you as long as the night. There are many things that can stop you. Random errors can occur and phantoms can stop you. When you have a error, you go to the control panel and boot them up.  It takes about 5-8 seconds. If you choose reboot all, then it takes 10-12 seconds. There are also phantoms that trigger errors, and a phantom  (The Puppet), can get in your face for about 12 seconds. You use the play audio to lure springtrap away. But, if the audio error goes off, then you cant use it. Video errors can make you not see, and ventilation errors can make you hallucnate. There are also vents that he can go through, but you can seal them in.\n\nAnyway, I rate this 100/100","April 6, 2015","true","5.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","12","15","3","0"

But this one is even better\nThe jumpscares in this one are scary and unpredictable.\nThe atmosphere and the sound in this game is creepy.\nFive nights at Freddy's 3 is easier than Five nights at Freddy's 2 and i like it.\nand more reason why i love this game is because they bring the old system back. which is you can watch all of the camera. Because in the second one you can only watch one camera to wind up the music box.\n\nThe only way to defense yourself in this game is to keep an eye on springtrap and don't let him get to your room.\nbecause there are no doors and mask.\n\nI already beat night 1 - 5. so here is a tip that i use:\n1. on the begining of the night, go find where the heck Springtrap is in the camera\n2. if you find him, keep an eye on him until he left\n3. play the Audio to distract him and he'll be back to the room\n4. keep doing that and reboot the system if error\n5. you must listen to the Springtrap movement\n6. if springtrap is already in the ventilation, seal it as quickly as possible\n7. Springtrap will be back into one of the room\n8. keep doing that until 6 AM\n\noh yeah, and the last thing you need to play this game is LUCK......\nand i forgot to mention that the scariest thing in this game is the STORY and the MINI GAMES.\nthe mini games is disturbing as hell. creepy.\nThis game is kinda addictive.\n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS GAME TO ALL OF YOU PEOPLE WHO LOVE HORROR GAMES AND FOR THOSE WHO HAD PLAYED FNAF 1 AND FNAF 2.\n\n10/10 for me\n\n","March 6, 2015","true","9.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","11","16","3","0"

I played and enjoyed both games, they worked well with eachother, sometimes annoying but decent controls, I've even found myself liking many of the characters and such almost as if I'd been in that pizzaria in person and felt nostalgia.... But this game.... Oh this game.. Scott rushed it, its blatantly obvious he rushed it. He said he was taking his time, still working on the game, Beta test results, and then releases the full game RIGHT after the demo... Big, bloody, mistake. I love FNaF, I truly do, but this game is a collosal blemish on the FNaF series, and here is why.\n\nRepair mechanic: On paper, and even in gameplay a bit, this seems like a really good idea, functional to an extent, and made sort of a lick of sense. Then you have audio go out after one use, cameras going on and off more than a child messing with light switches, and then ventilation more faulty than lower class condos, and THAT is saying something. A repair mechanic is interesting and can add challenge, but not when my sister's cat is more cooperative than this darn device. A CAT.\n\nThe Phantoms: BB, Chica, Marionette, Freddy, Mangle, and Foxy, all of them with decently made jumpscares, none of them can hurt you. Yeah, a bit of a red light having jumpscares as threatening as a fridge magnet, but it evens itself out, or rather tries to, by disabling some of your equipment in the process. Primarily it seems they mess with ventilation above all, and sometimes touch the other two for extra annoyance. "annoyance? what could be annoying?" I assume you're not asking yourself, but I will answer anyway. Sure, night one is a breeze (because literally nothing happens) and night 2 you have to be lingering around the cameras a LOT to get one of the phantoms, but 3 and onwards they are worse than a little sister wanting to play dressup, they are almost literally on your tail and want to stay there. Right now I've figured out their patterns "for the most part"\n\nChica: activated when you look at a picture or what ever it is, for too long.\nFreddy: watching him limp across your window view.\n\nBB: looking at him in one of the cameras and not switching quickly enough.\n\nMangle: same as BB.\n\nMarionette: same as BB and Mangle, only you more often than not have pretty much no chance to switch cameras.\n\nAnd Foxy, well, he just seems like he does what he wants, no pattern with him as far as I can tell... and all of them get VERY annoying and rage inducing, VERY quickly.\n\nThen one animatronic: sure it sounds like a redlight, but I had hope for it, Scott is decent with making challenging A.I.s so I assumed it would be good.  The darn thing is non existent the first night, barely does anything the second night, suddenly B-lines to you from 3 and onward, 5 being the cheapest by far, he is extremely mobile for the first couple of rooms, then suddenly I can look at every camera with him in none, not even vent cameras, and he will suddenly be at my office, no warning, no nothing. Whether it be through the vents to my door or looking in with that smug bloody grin, he's there. That, despite making me very angry, I can sort of tolerate...a bit.. What REALLY gets me, is he can be all the way at the beginning of the fright attraction, I could have the vent he goes to the most based on my gameplay style sealed off, then if I either close the camera to be greeted by a jumpscare, have anything go off, anything less than perfect happen, BOOM, hes at my door... from the very beginning of the attraction, in less than seconds, the vent to my hallway sealed off, he is there with no time for me to spare. Broken, absolutely broken.\n\nSure, the other 2 games were challenging and had some cheap shots every now and then, but at least they had some consistency with what to expect, and heck, at least THEY had patterns, even the Phantoms have patterns, and horribly predictable ones. Springtrap has none. He is just spaztic and loves to walk, even somehow teleporting like Bonnie did in FNaF one, only much worse. Bonnie moved like two rooms away from where he was or if he was being nice to you, just one room away from where he was. Springtrap is just "Cam 9? NOPE, your hallway!" and sometimes worse and more broken than that. He went from a vent... to a vent on the other side of the dang building... how.. No rooms inbetween, just vent, then vent.... after seeing that crud I need to vent right now. This game is nothing compared to its predecessors, it is broken and horribly flawed, almost as though I was playing the beta, an unfinished bloody beta.\n\nIf Scott is going to make any updates to this game, they better be quick, because Springtrap and the Phantoms have adapted to my playstyle in a way that makes night 5 impossible for me. Which sucks because I heard this game had very good story additions, which now I'll never know without watching youtube. Nice going there Scott, not knocking you for adaptive A.I.s, just broken unplayable adaptive A.I. based games.. FNaF 1, a classic in my eyes, FNaF 2, a worthy sequel, FNaF 3... a pile of feces, spring trap would be more fitting if the game were released on spring, and this whole bloody game was a trap for all the FNaF fans that would be disappointed... unless they are blinded by endless like of mediocre material. I know I'm dragging on here, but I don't want the last game in the trillogy, assuming this is the last, to be mediocre. I was impressed with more moving animations, then I was slowly enraged with how horribly everything interacts with each other. Like the jumpscares piling ontop of eachother like salami on a sandwich. Not as good looking or satisfying as eating the sandwich, buddy. To wrap it up here so I stop rambling, I am horribly disappointed.. the game Scott said he would spend the most time on feels the most rushed.\n2.5/10 is my rating. (apologies if I made any spelling errors.)\n\n[Edit]\nI recently watched some playthroughs and such to finally gain the story portions I couldn't reach, and it was genuinely saddening for me yet a sigh of relief to see the good ending.

Springtrap is foreboding, BB is horrifying, and watching Freddy stumble across your window, almost taunting you-\nIt all looks very good. Watching the animatronics move is quite refreshing, and it makes you feel just that much more helpless than before.\n\nThe Pros?\n- Moving animatronics\n\n-The disgusting run down building and animatronics are very atmospheric\n\n-A plethora of hidden minigames\n\n-The minigames themselves are challanging to figure out, but not impossible. The new style is great, and the pixel art is very creepy, definately an upgrade from fnaf2.\n\n-provides some much needed plot information\n\n-Truly frightening jumpscares\n\n-Phone guy audio is very interesting\n\n-Leading Springtrap around with sound is a cool new concept\n\n-The ability to lock down vents is very helpful\n\n-Leaving you alone the first night is an amazing way to let you start to figure out the controls and new mechanics\n-its fnaf 3\n\nHOWEVER, for everything this game does right, it seems to fall short on several other accounts.\nCons:\n\n-The minigames might be a little TOO hard to find sometimes\n\n-Once the puppet gets you its pretty much game over since he lingers far too long, and avoiding him is near      impossible.\n\n-There seems to be a glitch where you can see springtrap in two different locations at the same time\n(very disorienting- seriously needs to be fixed)\n\n-Once springtrap gets up to your window or door, theres nothing you can really do to get rid of him, usually leading to      a very punishing and unfair defeat ( unfortunately this seems to be the trend with most of these cons :\)\n\n-Springtrap likes to teleport to your office from cam 2 or 3 without using vents (really upsetting since once he gets to you he cant be led away)\n\n-Sometimes Springtrap likes to ignore your audio cues. Not sure if its a glitch, intentional, or if im doing something wrong, but its seriously upsetting.\n\n-no tutorial or instructions to help you actually figure out the mechanics (not everyone enjoys trial and error)\n\n-Springtrap's jumpscare is nonexistant (he looks more like he wants to hug you)\n\n-The jumpscares dont seem to have any pattern or method of avoidance (namely foxy, freddy, and by the time you SEE puppet its too late to switch cams. also, I can only ever get away from chica SOMETIMES)\n\n-Springtrap travels through the vents WAAAY too quickly. Once one of your systems goes offline, he usually decides to get in a vent and travel into or up to your office before you can even finish rebooting.\n\n-This one may be a nitpick, but I prefer that failure not be left up to random chance.\nIt would be nice if ALL of the jumpscares had a warning of some sort, or weren't so crippling at least.\nWhile I think its absolutely fine to make the odds stacked against me, Springtrap shouldnt be able to teleport from cam 2 to my window in 3 seconds.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the experience, and this game is SO close to being amazing that its painful to give this game a negative review. But I just love this series too much to just let it be mediocre. The entire time, I felt like a beta tester, and im sure that that isn't what Scott was aiming for.\nTo be perfectly honest, if this game gets a good patch or two, and most of these cons get fixed, I will certainly change my review.\nThis game has the potential to be a strong title in the series so long as these glaring issues are dealt with.\nOverall, I would rate this game at 6.5/10 until its fixed. (No matter how badly I want to give it 9/10)\n\nUntil then, Cheers, and keep up the great work, Scott. Can't wait to see what you come up with next.","March 5, 2015","false","3.6"," 128 of 244 people (52%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","52","128","244","8","4"

This is a game series that revolves around learning a few key mechanics and just repeating them over and over whilst hoping that the odds are in your favor and the randomized placement of the monsters is fair enough to let you progresss. This time you're working the control room as Freddy's has now been turned into an amusement park attraction.\n\nThere's 1 robot that's come to life and the others are mere hallucinations which cause you to have some sort of seizure and ultimately black out. It's a combination of lightning fast reflexes and just blind luck that becomes annoying very quickly. We're still not given a proper options menu or save system and the game is still running in an ugly 4:3 resolution that warps when played full screen.\n\nYou have to admire this guy (Scott Cawthon) though for what he's done single handedly. He's created a huge fanbase, mostly Lets Players, but there is rich and compelling lore to uncover and the games have a terrifying atmosphere with lots of frightening jump scares.\n\nI guess I had just hoped that by the third game, it would've been more than just slightly changed gameplay and a new setting. If you're a fan of the older games I guess this one has to be played out of necessity, but people who were on the fence about the previous games aren't going to be swayed.\n\nFull video review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9U0IiKm0ik","March 4, 2015","false","2.8"," 242 of 466 people (52%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","52","242","466","24","8"

I'm massively active and reasonably well known in the fan base, I've actually contacted the creator personally, and I've played and beaten every game in the series. I am a REALLY big fan of the series.\n\nBut I'm actually disappointed by this game.\n\nFNAF 1 was something new, unique, and different. It had an atmosphere that chokes you, claustrophobia and some agoraphobia at the SAME TIME, and everything about it was terrifying. I've beat the game, and still it terrifies me.\n\nFNAF 2 was an exciting sequel- it introduced loads of cool mechanics, changed everything round HUGELY, and completely revamped the awesome story. It was brilliant. Not as scary as the first one once you got used to it, but it still scares occasionally. I love both of those games, and completely recommend you get them. If you don't have them, get them.\n\nFNAF 3 is just... not as scary. It doesn't have any of the atmosphere that the two earlier games have, and the horror in it is almost not there. I was terrified to play it the first time- certain things made me crap myself. Things such as Mangle outside my window freaked me out, since I had no idea what was happening. The first time I put my camera down and saw Freddy limping across past my window, I almost cried. I was terrified- what do I do? What's going to happen? Then he jumpscared me and I screamed, blah blah blah. I saw the creepy Chica face, got jumpscared, screamed. Saw Foxy in my room- you see where this is going. But now, almost two weeks after the game came out, I'm used to it. 4 hours in, and I'm getting kinda bored.\n\nThere's a LOT to do- to get the good ending, you need to hunt down all the hidden minigames then beat them in the secret way, which will involve playing through the entire 5 nights again. Or, should I say, 4 nights. There is nothing to do on Night 1, at all. No enemies. Unlike the first two games, where Night 1 would throw you in at the deep end with an easy yet still failable night so you are forced to learn all the mechanics- quick! In this one, nothing happens on Night 1. You listen to the new Phone Guy talk to you, then flip bored between the cameras for 3 in game hours.  There is a plot reason- Springtrap, the new animatronic, hadn't been discovered by this point. But still, from a gameplay point of view, it's disappointing.\n\nMore about Springtrap- he's your only enemy in this game. There are hallucinations which will show up to jumpscare you occasionally, but Springtrap is the only one who will end your game. Such a shame, then, that he's totally unscary. I can see what Scott Cawthon, creator of the game, was doing with the design... Bonnie, probably the scariest antagonist of the first two games, is represented in a 'zombie' form. This makes sense plot wise, of course- but that would be a spoiler. But the 'zombie' version just isn't frightening. The original animatronics were scary because of their 'uncanny valley' appearance, kid friendly cartoon animals coming for your blood. So when the antagonist is a generic zombie creature, that unique little spark is gone.\n\nPlot-wise, this game is possibly the best so far. The minigame after Night 5 made me absolutely freak out- it was my personal favourite moment in the Five Nights at Freddy's series. It beat the FNAF 1 Night 5 phone call to the absolute best moment. So that's a pro.\n\nBut despite this, I really hate to say that this game is unrecommended. I like the game- if it was standalone, I'd be here singing it's praises. But it doesn't live up to the previous games on the horror scale. The atmosphere that I so loved in the previous games is dead and gone. I went into this game at first hoping it would be incredible. It was certainly hyped, and I stayed up all night refreshing all the associated pages, and ended up disappointed.\n\nSo when I say this game is unrecommended, I am by no means saying don't buy it. If you have the previous games, get it- for plot reasons, if nothing else. But seeing as this game is a horror, I feel I should judge it as such. The parts of the game that scared me most at first now make me laugh out loud- Freddy limping, for example, is thoroughly hilarious to sing 'Gotta Go Fast' or 'One Way Or Another' to. Unlike the first games, the horror has worn off for me already.\n\nI'm giving it a thumbs up because the developer deserves the money. The game deserves positive reviews, and the series deserves love.\n","March 15, 2015","true","3.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

This one was a blast.\n\nFive nights 3 is by far the easiest in the series. Instead of doors, a mask, or a flashlight, you now have.... a button on a camera panel. Sound hard? Well, it's the easiest in the series, but not easy.\n\nThe "only one" is a brand new (or very old) monster, in as many ways as possible. His name is Springtrap. He is not a bear, but a bunny. He is not purple, but gold. He is the only threat in the place, but there are multiple phantoms to hinder you, which vary form the other 3 Fazbears, to BB, The Puppet, and Mangle. While they may not be able to kill you, they can disable your ventilation, which attracts Springtrap, who CAN kill you, and nobody really needs to know how.\n\nHow do you prevent this? By simply ignoring them. Odd, I know. EITHER WAY, if you do get caught by them, you'll have to spin on over to a different panel to reboot the AUDIO, VIDEO, or VENTILATION. And no amount of perfect play will keep the wiring in Fazbear's Fright from failing, and to make up for there being 1 real threat, Old Uncle Springs is the fastest and smartest character in the series.\n\nTo keep the golden menace away, you're to lure him away with audio cues, but too many of that, and the audio goes offline, and to reboot it, you need to exit the cameras, which helps Springtrap go ever closer. However, if you lure him into either cam 9 or 10 and seal the vent next to it, and never let him get away, you pretty much win the game!\n\nAnd I haven't even mentioned the post-night and in-night minigames, and I'm not going to spoil those.\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's 3 is a good game, and with the focus on the story rather than the gameplay, I believe that it was a decision for the better.\n\nFanbase ain't the best, STILL, but they're calming down!\n\n\nAnd i was not ready for Aggresive Nightmare Phantom Freddy, especially when Phantom Foxy exists.","April 8","true","12.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It has a better mechanic than the others, because you have to actually look at the cameras and see where Springtrap is. It has the feel of a fan-game, though.

I probably would want the development to be a month longer, because that's how long the other game took, and they had a good feel to them. Anyways, I totally love this game, and I can't wait for all of the story to be revealed for us hardcore theorists in a likely 4th and maybe even 5th game.

Your game has scared my friends and you are a horror master. I suggest that you keep doing  what your doing with horror and don't make FNAF4 the last chapter. Maybe a spin off series.

There are many new features in the game such as being able to block off certain parts of the vents. You have to watch 2 different places now. The floor you're on and the vents. And although I subconsciously screamed and pressed the esc button when I saw the animatronic. There is also the repair for cameras, ventilation, and audio. I'm not sure what the audio does, but I believe its supposed to scare off animatronics your camera is facing.

The eastereggs scott hides makes the game all the better, and the random terrifying images of springtrap that appear before starting a night can be enough to have you abandoning your computer. Basically the reason why half of the people who reviewed this game have less than 20 minutes of playtime.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth, and very scary for the first week or two you play it. But eventually you get used to the repetitive and predictable jumpscares, and you can stare at the screen with a straight face while foxy jumps at the screen. This game can cause some great jumpscares, but only when you first buy it. The designs of the restaraunt and animatronics are very well done, and the animations (ex. springtrap walking across the glass window) will have you tensing up.\n\nThe game is fun at first, but ends up making you do the same thing over and over, but only harder each time. It is very repetitive, but will keep you in your seat to see what happens next. The minigames to support the storyline are practically the only difference in each level after reaching around night 3.\n\nNow, just because it is repetitive, does not mean it is not entertaining. The new ventallation/audio/camera system makes the game all the more tense. And to see springtrap run behind the camera basically means to brace for a jumpscare.\n\nGraphics: 8.5/10\n\nHorror: 7/10\n\nEntertainment: 8/10\n\nStoryline: 10/10\n\nOverall: 8.5/10\n\n","June 18, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonicfan0001/recommended/354140/","sonicfan0001","Sonicfan0001","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonicfan0001/","8 products in account","This game legitimately took me by surprise by how different it was. For those of you who thought dealing with only one animatronic wasn't hard... You thought wrong.\n\nWhile it may seem relatively easy, as you can basically pinball him from room to room, the systems don't exactly agree with you. What seems to be merely easy at first becomes a serious task, as hallucinations and quick thinking to reboot systems occur as well.\n\nThe story is revealed in an interesting way in this game, mostly through "Phone Dude's" training cassettes that he finds. We are once again visited by Phone Guy, this time in the form of suit handling and performing tips, revealing that the animatronics can, in fact, be worn.\n\nThe game's first night was brilliantly done in my opinion. It gives you a chance to memorize the place so you don't screw up majorly on later nights. It takes a more realistic take in that they don't even find Springtrap until after night 1, and therefore nothing would happen.\n\nThe graphics in this game are quite impressive as well. With only a couple of exceptions, Springtrap looks incredibly real, especially in a couple of camera positions. The jumpscares are well animated, and the game is pretty bug-free.\n\nThe game is still chock-full of secrets, which I like, and a lot of questions are answered.\n\nOverall, this game is challenging enough to keep you hooked, but not nearly as hard as the 2nd game. I rate this game a moderate 8-9/10. I recommend buying this if you want a solid, medium difficulty horror game.","March 10, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is good to show your students in health class. But before I tell you why, here is the general story behind the game.\n\nYou play as a man who decided to attach his camera & reboot systems to the wall and the floor, so he can... You know... Get some more exercise out of it by turning his chair every time. He must night watch the horror attraction and make sure people don't steal from the building (honestly who is going to steal what from a horror attraction -_-).\n\nYou must make sure those vents are always working, because they prevent the additional LSD from going through the vents and into your room. If they stop working, that is when, as the phone guy states, "you start seeing some crazy things". This is why it is good for health class, because you can scare your kids and show them what happens when you start hallucinating.\n\nBalloon boy also tends to walk around and make those annoying noises again. As I said in my last review, he graduated from the finest school of engineering and can disable your lights. But he died. So now he can't do any of that stuff (HA HA SUCK IT) and you may keep him away from your office by using audio in the camera system. Scott removed this of course, but the song that would play is "another one bites the dust", and so he would go to it. Why? I don't know.\n\nNow, you have to keep this "spring trap" thing away from your office. He is lonely and is looking for someone to pull his spring trap, because he wants to die. He can't reach it though. To be a good role model, you must say no and refuse to pull the trap. But if he gets up in your face and forces you to pull it, you are screwed and will feel guilty for the rest of your life. But, when your shift is over, you may tell a trusted adult about the situation.\n\nI love this game more than the last one. 10/10 Scott. Oh yeah and also, remember to ALWAYS close your camera on the screen where you see a hallucination. It will go away.\n","March 26, 2015","true","1.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

I found out there is only one active animatronic called Springtrap so I thought this gonna be piece of cake, but I was so wrong. Because the hallucinations of the other animatronic will mess up you things and try to scare the life out of you. The other thing is that Springtrap is a really fast one so you have to be quick before he gets you.\nPersonally if you are ready for Freddy and his friends, I can strongly recommand this and the other games to.

Scotts thing about 'Only one' really worked out, since the older animatronics are now in hallucination form.\n\nMy main issue with the game is that the jumpscares arent very scary, since most of the time you can see them coming. For example, if you see Phantom BB on the cameras, you know you will be jumpscared. They arent that scary in general too. Another issue is that it dosent really explain the mechanics that well to you, I dont know how to get rid of SpringTrap when he is in your office window/ door.\n\nOverall, it is a very good game.\n","March 7, 2015","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

True, this game is still scary, as I still jump every now and again at the jumpscares, especially Foxy's (that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥). Anyway, the mechanics are a LOT different from the last two and the camera is the main focus of the game rather than the office for once, and that's a welcome change. This game is also easier than the last two by far, though that isn't a bad thing. If you're looking for a scary experience that lasts, this isn't it. I would recommend this to people that are just starting to get into the FNaF series. Great game overall, it just doesn't have the same impact on me as the other two did.","March 26, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall: pretty good, though the jumpscares got repetitive. Hell, I could probably make a rave of this. It's definitely a good thing that this game brought an end to the series, though the setting could've been, well, improved.

In fact, it is almost TOO challenging but FNAF has always been more of a stress simulator than a horror simulator.\n\nFNAF 3 is littered with jumpscares that not only scare Christ himself out of you, but also leave you vulnerable. Rebooting needs to be considered and planned out to save time.\n\nThis particular game likes to give you confidence that it isn't going to be so hard the first two nights but quickly robs you of that and brings you back to what this game originally was... a stress simulator in the horror genre.\n\nIf you follow the story, then this one keeps your head filled with answers as well as questions to counter-balance the mindscrewing the series has always used against its players.\n\nIt is just so freaking difficult!\n\n8.5/10","June 9, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is different in a couple ways. Unlike before, there are actually TWO endings, a good and a bad ending. Obviously the good ending requires more work to get. There is a Nightmare mode, and an Extras menu. Now, onto the gameplay. There is one animatronic, he doesn't appear on Night 1, it's just the phone call on that night. Night 2 and beyond, he appears. You have to keep him away from your office at basically almost all times. You can use sounds in the cameras to lure him to a room next to the room he is in. You also have to worry about the audio devices, cameras, and ventilation errors, which then, you have to reset them to have them working again. In my opinion, this was the easiest FNAF game. That was my review on FNAF3, with no actual spoilers in terms of story. If you have the other two games, this is a must buy. 10/10 Great game, great story, much fun.","March 4, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

True, this game is still scary, as I still jump every now and again at the jumpscares, especially Foxy's (that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥). Anyway, the mechanics are a LOT different from the last two and the camera is the main focus of the game rather than the office for once, and that's a welcome change. This game is also easier than the last two by far, though that isn't a bad thing. If you're looking for a scary experience that lasts, this isn't it.

Don't get me wrong, this is a great game. Its just, the original was so much better than this game, and even though I love this game, the features aren't all that great. The story however, is one of the best parts of this game, more so than the features. The game is noticeably not as scary as the original, but compared to the second game, it is almost as scary. The game still remains as mysterious as the other ones, but with some things revealed more than the past games.\n\nStory:\n\nJust like the other games, the backstory for this game is truly amazing from what we can see. The ending is so much better than the previous games, and provides an amazing experience story wise.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThis game definitely is not as good as the original, and falls shorter than the previous sequel to the original. Although this game is scary at first, it does fail to scare you as much as the original game did, and although the game's story is great, the game's features could have been so much better.\n\nRating:\n\n6.5/10\n\n+ Deep Story\n+ Amazing Animations\n+ Detailed Atmosphere\n\n- Game isn't as scary as intended.\n- Formula is definitely starting to get worse.\n- Features aren't all that great.\n\nBuy this if you like Five Nights at Freddy's, if you don't; do not buy this game.","July 27, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But to be honest, I was farely dissapointed with a part of the game; and what is that part of the game? The jumpscares. I was kind of frustrated to see the springtrap jumpscare. In fact, I wouldn't even classify as one. Springtrap's attack really deleted the "Jump" out of "Jumpscare". It was just a regular old spook. Now, many would argue that the Phantom's jumpscares were scary, but they were more expected than out of nowhere. Of course, they can be scary the first couple times, but after the first couple nights, they are pretty much expected. For example, BB can be seen on the screen, and if you don't swith the cameras, you'll geet jumpscared. Chica can be seen from the arcade game screen. Freddy can be seen in the hallway and can be ignored by entering the cameras. Now, i'm not going to get into a bigger conversation about my dissapointment of the jumpscares, and just say that I love this game and I reccomend it to any FNaF fan! I rate 8/10!","March 19","true","13.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/putasijaja/recommended/354140/","putasijaja","mermood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/putasijaja/","13 products in account","Hello everyone, i just wanted to do a review on this game mainly because i've never done a review before on a game but also it's because i love this game!. First off when i loaded the game up the menu music is quite catchy but thats a personal thing xD, what really suprised me in this game is how dark and different it felt to all of the other games. I'm sure all of you know that fnaf1 and fnaf2 had a certain feel to it that made it feel like Five night's at freddys, or i'm just insane one or the other. I also like the green tint scott put into the map to give it a uniqe feel.\n\nAnyway i must talk about the gameplay instead of me rambling about my personal obsessions. The camera mechanic has been VASTLY improved from the second game (because most of you all know fnaf2's camera system was broken) i think scott really put this into mind because i feel as if 75% of this game is the camera, and the fact that scott made it hard to see springtrap in that pixelated camera. These momments where you are trying to find springtrap in a camera but you cant find him are probably one of the scarriest momments of this game. The maintenance panel was a huge success! very creepy especially when the ventilation has failed and your just a sitting duck, and then you hear springtrap crawl into the vents. This is probably the most stressful feeling i've felt in a game in a long time (apart from extreme rage xD). And after you complete the 5 nights you unlock nightmare mode, as the name says.. it's a nightmare xD\n\nOk now i would like to talk about the scare mechanics and the way the animatronics influence me in my play sessions. First off phantom freddy is a great way to stop me from camping the door at 5 am because if he jumpscares me (more on that later) i will have to reset my ventilation which almost always end me up in death from springtrap. Mangle is a great mechanic i must say! its extremely stressful and annoying when you are trying to look for springtrap on the camera but then you have to reset your audio. And for phantom BB, he is quite easy to avoid if your fast enough to switch cameras or put down your camera all together but if your not paying attention he will give you a proper scare sometimes! And now for the puppet, i saved this one for last because i hate it the most xD. I  will find myself trying to look for springtrap and then all of a sudden the puppet pops out, then you have to wait for lke 5 -7 seconds before he goes away and then you have to reset your ventilation which takes like 5 seconds too. It isnt a bad mechanic at all, i just find it annoying at times. Now for the scares, like all scares in horror games they all get you by suprising you. When you first get the game i litreally almost ♥♥♥♥ myself getting jumpscared by phantom freddy, but over time it gets repeatitive and you nearly always know when they are coming. But the magle jumpscare is the most starteling. It's a very loud screach of a corrupted message or something, very scary sometimes!.\nbut for all of the other jumpscares they all get repeatitive over time, including springtraps.\n\nOk now that all of the game mechanics are covered i would like to talk about the story and the lore that scott put into this game. I think scott tried his best on this game to cover most of the big theories that people have been debating about since the first game. I really like the minigames you get everytime you pass a night, because i like playing with purple guy by trying to run away from him xD,. which leads me into the minigames themselfs, you are one of the original animatronics in the five nights at freddys 1 pizzeria and every time you follow this mysteroius purple freddy you get the error message of that you cant enter the room he ran to as soon as you try and run away he runs out as purple man and screams and rips you apart. This can be exremly starteling if you just got the game, but as i alluded to before it gets repeatitive after 1 time. But this mini game where you follow purple freddy to a room and jumps at you and rips you apart last for 4 nights. I won't talk about the fifth night minigame as it contains masive spoilers :p.\n\nNow that im over with the minigames i must talk about the legend of the franchise... PHONE GUY, well to me he is a legend xD but this time theres twist this time. As most of you know this game is set in 2017 phone guy from the original pizzerias is most likely dead so instead we get a new phone guy who scott cawthon the developer himself voices as a hip teenager. when i first loaded up this game i found the phone call hillarious to listen too, scott voicing as a over exited teenager was a nice touch. Though i dont know if he was supposed to be the manager or someone else. The training tapes that the original phone guy recorded get played over the phone as you play the game and i think is a nice touch because it really describes the story alot these phone calls, or at least describes what happend on night 5 and why springtrap has a human inside of him.\nMy biggest complaint about this game is the good ending and the bad ending, sure getting the good ending is a thing to be proud off but what confuses me the most is how 99 percent of people who play this game their first try will get the bad ending after they finish the game for the first time. In my opinion it doesnt seem worth it to play these secret minigames and glitch out of them to get the good ending as all you get is a 3rd star and a different ending screen. Tough i did do it to get the 3rd star it wasnt that fun. But there is one thing that is fun out of all of that... The minigames! i especially love the chica minigame where you collect cake and give it to children, don't ask me why i like this minigame so much xD, but this is a personal complaint. Overall the good ending is a nice touch as it lets people know that the childrens spirits are free, almost makes me happy to think that those kids that got stuffed into a suit are now free and at peace.\n\nOk i think i'm done now xD i've covered all that i wanted to cover without releasing spoilers (or at least big ones). If anyone took the time to read the whole thing of my lengthy review then thank you because i'm not the best at english and i might of sounded sloppy at times xD. Overall i rate this game as a 8/10 for being fun/scary and stressful at the same time.","April 22, 2015","true","8.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Still haven't beaten it, but Scott, it's like you knew and planned accordingly! <3\n\nAll joking aside, I honestly can't decide if this one or the first game is my favorite. I love the suspense, I love the story breadcrumbs, I love the minigames (I just about died when I found the Chica one. XD It's so damn cute!), and I especially love the ending. I won't spoil it, but I love how it ties up enough of the big questions to feel satisfying, while leaving just enough ambiguity to keep you wondering.\n\nThe game mechanics are a LOT better. One thing about the first two games is the cameras, after a few nights, tend to fall into disuse (the first game can be beaten by just quick checks on Freddy and Foxy, and in the second, you have so much going on that really, the only time the cameras are bothered with is for the music box). This one practically keeps you at the cameras, allowing you to take in more details (and hints to the minigames) and explore the area. I also love the two-map system, and the improvement on the second game's vents with the ability to shut them to keep Springtrap out of the office. I also love the phantoms. Sure, I curse and flip off the screen about every time Balloon Boy comes up, but I love that it gives you a quick panic without actually killing you, kind of like seeing Bonnie or Chica at your door in the first game.\n\nI also like that the third game actually takes a bit of skill to play rather than chance. The first game is notorious for the "5am Roulette," where it's up to chance if Freddy plays his full song before killing you or not (along with with whether or not Bonnie and Chica BOTH decide to camp at the doors to waste your power, and for how long they do it), and in the second, with how many animatronics there are gunning for you, winning really CAN depend on the random number generator. For example, there was a later night (3 or 4) where I had the old Bonnie, Freddy, and Chica in my office one after the other with the music box winding down. Because there was literally someone there EVERY DAMN TIME I put down the monitor after winding the box the minimum time I needed to do something else, I didn't have a chance to flick the flashlight to keep Foxy away (guess who killed me that round. XP). But then there was another round of Night 4 where practically no one came, Foxy stayed away, I had plenty of time to keep the box wound, and I had old Bonnie in my office maybe twice the whole night. It was almost like the game was TRYING to be nice and get me onto Night 5 already. XP\n\nThis one, however, you have almost complete control of the elements. Phantoms can be avoided by taking quick breaks from the cameras or changing camera views. There's a bit of consistency on when your systems break, so you can account for them and plan accordingly. You can control where Springtrap goes, and you can control how you keep him away from you (sounds and blocking the vents). There's still some chance involved (like the Phantoms, and Springtrap taking advantage of the time it takes you to reboot your system), but overall, living or dying really DOES depend on you, and not how generous the bots feel that night. XP\n\nOverall, I think this is the perfect ending to a great series. It has an excellent conclusion, lots of fun stuff to find, great game play, and even things to unlock. Another game is not necessary; this one beautifully came full circle. I would love for it to end on a high note.","March 7, 2015","true","2.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

It always gave me chills, for it gave off a fallout or bomb shelter vibe to me. It destroys the mechanics of the last two games almost entirely, and is nothing like the fourth. Also, Springtrap was, for sure, an interesting character to bring to the family. Being more decayed than the withered copies, but not as much as the Nightmares, he was the scariest one around at the time of the release. That is, of course, besides the Phantoms. I'd recommend this game to anyone who'd like burnt and withered animatronics jumpscaring the life out of them.

Freddy is barely in the game. This shouldnt even be called five nights at freddys 3 it should be called five nights at golden bonnie that was randomly thrown in the story to keep the plot going.\n\n2. one animotronic. There are the phantom animotronics but they cant kill you they just scream in youre face and screw up one of youre systems which feels cheap considering the fact they do it every 5 seconds of every night      (except night 1)\n\n3. Night 1. No one moves\n\n4. Gets boring. Its fun at first but by the time you get to night 4 youre like "I swear if I hear that annoying scream again im chucking my computer on the floor"\n\n5.

And then there's phantom freddy who slowly trudges past the window, and if you pay too much attention to him you'll be greated with a gigantic jumpscare. Foxy comes out of nowhere and jumps you with no warning whatsoever. BB graduates from annoying to terrifying. If you catch a glimpse of Phantom chica, it's Jumpscare O' Clock. if you see mangle for even a second it dashes down to your window and makes a screetching sound, attracting Springtrap to your location.  And you know what? Scott Cawthon is a GIGANTIC troll.

Who knew how hell-bent these animatronics were on stuffing me into the innards of a cute and cuddly stuffed suit? Oh yeah. That was terrifying. Many failures were had. Many ragequits too.\n\nBut you know something? I had a lot of fun. I'm not entirely sure why, but I did. Maybe it was the depth of the story combined with how the creator chose to tell it -- with subtle hints and hidden explanations? Or maybe it's because this game nearly sent me into cardiac arrest once or twice, something no horror game has ever done for me. I don't know.\n\nWhatever it is, it worked.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zackyoyoyoyoy/recommended/354140/","zackyoyoyoyoy","good meme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zackyoyoyoyoy/","119 products in account","This game is not as good as I thought it would so I'm gonna aline the cons and the pros throughout the whole series.\n\n1. The series, not only the game but the series was rushed way too much. Every 3-2 months he released a new game of Five Night's at Freddy's, which made it really rushed and not great. If it was not rushed and took at least 6 months for every game, this series would be amazing! Graphics & Design - 6/10\n\n2. The storyline is great I must say that. This game evolves around 30 years into the future where you are running the nightshift of Fazbear's Fright! They gathered the animontronics from the older places and brought them here for the attraction just to make it seem better. I loved the story through-out the games so I got to make this a pro. Storyline - 10/10\n\n3. The sound was great in this game but it was rushed like the first thing I stated. He used the same jumpscare voice for everyone in the games 1 and 3! Here I'll explain how, In the first game he used the normal jumpscare noise and slowed it down to make golden freddys. In the third he just reversed it and just said, "10/10 perfect" and put it for everysingle animontronic. (Seriously?) The game should have each animontronic a different jumpscare noise it just kills the fun and mystery through the game. Sound - 7/10\n\n4. The jumpscares were great and all but I think they need some work. The spring trap jumpscare was just disapointing :( He just made springtraps jumpscare him walking up to you, not even scary at all. The only real scary jumpscare is Balloon Boy which is the Chica jumpscare from FNAF 2. The jumpscares are scary and all but just need some work. Jumpscares - 4/10\n\n5. The gameplay I gotta admit is not that bad, better than I though atleast BUT, as the game was too easy in the last ones he had to make it more complicated with no light and instead you have windows control panel and half to fix the audio errors, you ventilation (lmao makes sense?) and the cameras. Not only that but you have to make the balloon boy laugh if where ever you want the spring trap to go. But then there are the Mini-Games to get the good ending which are pretty fun and complicatied. Sooooooo... Gameplay - 8/10\n\nOverall Stats!\n--------------\nGraphics & Design - 12/20\nStory Line - 20/20\nSound - 14/20\nJumpscares - 8/20\nGameplay - 16/20\nTotal = 70/100 C- This game isn't bad It just could of had more work put into it.","March 13, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You actually feel like your being hunted by something in real life!\n\nNow let's get started with the threats, there is 1 pyshical animatronic in this game, and 6 other ones from the previous games. The new animatronic in this game is called Spring Trap. He's just the sneakiest of all the animatronics and will hide in the most difficult spots of your camera. You've gotta be checking those cameras alot or you'll be in a lot of trouble. Including the vents, you must seal off the area where Spring Trap is. This animatronics LOVES to play hide and seek with you. He can run past your camera and you might not even see him. He blends in with the walls and darkness easily, so you'll need to concentrate on the walls and darkness. I won't spoil the names of the other animatronics so you can get the best of spooks.\n\nNext, the defense is key in surviving all 5 nights (6 if you feel like playing it) you'll need to play audio throughout the map in order to lure Spring Trap away from you and keep you alive. Like I said earlier, if it's need close a vent area and keep him from entering the left, front and right (which leads straight into your office)\n\nOverall, this game kicks ♥♥♥ than the 2nd one. This one changes your play style and makes you need to check every single camera in the building. This story line for the game is excellent, i'll reccomend this to anyone who feels like getting it. However, when I first saw this game, I felt like it was boring and not buying it because it felt way old in the past, even though it's 30 years later after fnaf 1 took place.\n\nMy Rating for this game is: 9/10 - Good Job Scott :)","March 4, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Back here again aren't we? As a "Sequel" to Five Nights at Freddy's 2 this one isn't scary as the last one, but is scarier than the original, and in horror games that's excatly what they try to do. Now let me tell you about this game.\nFNAF3 takes place at Fazbear's Fright the Horror Attraction, or as I like to call it Freddy's Fright. They never had animatronics but Night 2 you meet Springtrap. Keeping the design to a well known and fan-favorite of mine, he is yellow, and is withered. In addition to Springtrap, we have Phantom Freddy, Phantom BB, Phantom Chica, Phantom Foxy, and the Phantom Puppet, all of these are ghosts/hallucinations and will not kill you when jumpscared. Keep the Audio on certain rooms to prevent Springtrap from coming. And the Vents can be accessable by pressing the Toggle Map button.\nAll in all, FNAF3 wasn't better than the second, but definitley was better than the first one. I give this a 9.5/10\n\n*Finish beating Night 5* Finally! Wait what's this? *Sees Nightmare Mode* FUUUUUUUUUUUU\n\n\n\n*17 weeks after beating Nightmare Mode* YES!!! *Sees Scott's new Teaser for FNAF4* *cries* *Static*","April 30, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

The games themselfes are ok. I liked the previous ones better than this one and the fourth one, but anyway. Let's start the review.\n\nThe Pros:\n\nThe Art/Graphics: I think that Scott really took his time to make this game, in my opinion. I like both the 3d in-game style and the 2d Atari style.\n\nThe Sound: In this game, you will probably spend most of your time listening to different sounds. For example, when Springtrap crawls in the vents.\n\nThe Story: The story in this game is still pretty meh, but I like it. "Thirty years after Freddy Fazbear's Pizza closed it's doors, the events that took place there have become nothing more than a rumor and a childhood memory, but the owners of "Fazbear's Fright: The Horror Attraction" are determined to revive the legend and make the experience as authentic as possible". You, the player, work at this "Horror Attraction" and have to, 1. Make sure that Springtrap stays inside and\n2. Make sure you don't die.\n\nThe cons:\n\nThe Gameplay: In this game, you don't have any doors. Instead you use the cameras to move Springtrap around. You can also use the cameras to close off vents. That's it. Oh and you also need to restart your systems every like, two seconds.\nNot very fun. And I forgot to mention, the only animatronic that can kill you is Springtrap. There are also these Phantom Animatronics that ♥♥♥♥ up your systems everytime they jumpscare you.\n\nThe Scares: Not scary after a while.\n\nFinal Score: 4/10\nPlay this if you really like FNaF, if you haven't played a FNaF game before, play the first two, then maybe give it a shot.","January 23","false","3.2"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","14","29","0","3"

FNaF 3 takes it to the next level with various multitasking involving visuals, audial preference, and hyperventilation. FNaF 3 is meant to take place 30+ years after the first FNaF game. Another thing I had to add; I just Love how Scott made it so you could actually see the animitronics move within your area, Which scared the ever-living ♥♥♥♥ out of me when I saw it. If you haven't played FNaF 2 yet, I wouldn't suggest playing FNaF 3, Due to the multitasking.(The FNaF2 Musicbox) Anyway, To conclude: Five Nights at Freddy's a terrific game; I love the graphics; I love the super-withered hallucination animatronics, And I love the all-round game it self. If you enjoy the Five Nights at Freddy's games; I would 100%'ly suggest you to get this game. 9.8/10, Very nicely done, Scott.\nRatingsCategoryRatingGame-play8.5/10Scare Aspect10/10Story(Sequel)9/10Visuals10/10All-round Enjoyment9/10","March 2, 2015","true","15.4"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","47","9","19","4","1"

FNaF 3 takes it to the next level with various multitasking involving visuals, audial preference, and hyperventilation. FNaF 3 is meant to take place 30+ years after the first FNaF game. Another thing I had to add; I just Love how Scott made it so you could actually see the animitronics move within your area, Which scared the ever-living ♥♥♥♥ out of me when I saw it. If you haven't played FNaF 2 yet, I wouldn't suggest playing FNaF 3, Due to the multitasking.(The FNaF2 Musicbox) Anyway, To conclude: Five Nights at Freddy's a terrific game; I love the graphics; I love the super-withered hallucination animatronics, And I love the all-round game it self. If you enjoy the Five Nights at Freddy's games; I would 100%'ly suggest you to get this game. 9.8/10, Very nicely done, Scott.\nRatingsCategoryRatingGame-play8.5/10Scare Aspect10/10Story(Sequel)9/10Visuals10/10All-round Enjoyment9/10","March 2, 2015","true","15.4"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","47","9","19","4","1"

The first one was simple, kind of fun, and interesting to see what would happen. The rest were repeats of that.\n\nHere's what I mean:\n\nFNAF 2 was the same game but with no doors, a vent system a mask, and horrible looking animatronics. I won't talk much about that though, let's get into this game now!\n\nFNAF 3.\nFNAF 3.\nFNAF 3.\n\n"Oh boy, I can't wait to play the same game with slightly better graphis, a cool looking trailer, and no defense systems!" Said every 9 year-old fanboy ever. The only reason I have the game is because a friend sent it to me, and I decided, why the heck not?\n\nSeriously though, the first night nothing happens, and then this little scene at the end. You spend a minute following this weird guy down a hall as slow as a snail, then this purple guy kills you! The next night you learn that there was no reason to be worried about checking those cameras. I have not completed the whole game because I couldn't bear to go further. I finished night two and got as bored as hell and just dished it.\n\nThank you for your time.","June 11, 2015","false","0.3"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","3"

In fact, they are a great game franchise. I just don't think that this one was as scary as the first, second, and fourth.\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's 3 is great for revealing bits of the story and lore to the FNaF franchise. And I respect it for that. But I think that it could've been scarier. The only scary jumpscre in the game, in my opion, is phantom Chica's. And hers isn't all that scary either. FNaF 4 brought the scare back, with the audio, and NIGHTMARE animatronics, but this game feels too much like a filler game to complete the story, rather than another scary game. In my opion, the anticipation of the jumpscare is worse than the jumpscre itself.\n\nAgain, I have nothing against Scott and the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise, but this game isnt that scary. In my opion, anyway, the game is a little scary. This game isn't bad, the game is kinda just mediocre. I do not recommend this, and sugest you look at other FNaF titles.","September 19, 2015","false","29.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The animation was clunky, the gameplay sucked, and really, ONE ANIMATRONIC! The idea sounded great on paper, but it was executed terribly. The phantom animatronics were a cool effect to the game, but they weren't scary at all. Overall this game (in my opinion) was by FAR, the worst FNAF game and its not worth $8.00.

После 2 части все затаив дыхание ждали, ждали что 3 часть будет грандиозной, станет верхушкой Indie хорроров. Я поиграл час и дошёл до пятой ночи. Да, там было страшно первые 5 скримеров, потом ты просто запоминаешь где они появляются и это перестаёт тебя пугать. Не забываем что главная перчинка геймплея это противостояние анимотроникам, но и тут Скотт решил избавить нас от этого, так как в игре их SPOILER Это были минусы, но в этой игре есть и плюсы добавили второй планшет для усложнения, теперь нужно следить не только за комнатами, но и за всей вентиляцией, Ещё + 4 и 5 ночь действительно трудные, где нужно подгадывать где будут передвигаться наши механические друзья, НО 1 2 и 3 ночь настолько лёгкие что даже пятиклассник пройдёт и не испугается.\nВообщем подведя итог могу сказать, что игра потеряла хватку в роли хоррора и больше стала походить на лёгкий Indie Action. Но если вам понравились прошлые две части, я думаю вас ничего не остановит, так что играйте и получайте хотя бы какое то наслждание, ведь не зря мы ждали её так долго.","March 18, 2015","true","2.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","43","3","7","4","0"

As you can probably tell from my previous reviews of these games, I love the franchise and feel that Scott Cawthon has given us the perfect combination of tension, fear, and curiosity about the story surrounding these games. I will admit, when I heard that this third installment was to only feature one animatronic, I was quite skeptical about how the game would be considered difficult with only one threat to worry about. But obviously I was proven wrong in my fears. Having only worked on this game since the beginning of January, Scott has outdone himself with new and great gameplay elements as well as the same good old tension that builds up over each night in the game. The fact that you have to abuse watching the cameras is great since in the previous two games I felt they got neglected quite a bit as the game got harder. But in this one, the audio systems which you use to lure the animatronic to separate rooms, and the toggling option to switch to the vent cameras are on the main camera feed so you have to constantly go back and use it which is great. I also like how this one animatronic gives the player so many problems since it is extremely quick in it's movements and often sticks to the hidden areas of the room it is in making it difficult to spot. And while it is the only real creepy killer you have to worry about, the addition of Phantom animatronics that are figments of your imagination and won't kill you makes up for the lack of physical entities that want to kill you. And of course, the fact that the systems you use can't be used indefinitely and must always be restored is a great feature and one that builds the tension and fear since it gives the animatronic a chance to advance closer to you. Overall a surprisingly fantastic addition to the Five Nights at Freddy's series and while I heavily suspect it is the last due to there being multiple endings that tie in with the dark and mysterious story, I will always remember these games as being a great example of how sometimes in scary games like these, it is not just all about the frights and spooks.","March 11, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

As you can probably tell from my previous reviews of these games, I love the franchise and feel that Scott Cawthon has given us the perfect combination of tension, fear, and curiosity about the story surrounding these games. I will admit, when I heard that this third installment was to only feature one animatronic, I was quite skeptical about how the game would be considered difficult with only one threat to worry about. But obviously I was proven wrong in my fears. Having only worked on this game since the beginning of January, Scott has outdone himself with new and great gameplay elements as well as the same good old tension that builds up over each night in the game. The fact that you have to abuse watching the cameras is great since in the previous two games I felt they got neglected quite a bit as the game got harder. But in this one, the audio systems which you use to lure the animatronic to separate rooms, and the toggling option to switch to the vent cameras are on the main camera feed so you have to constantly go back and use it which is great. I also like how this one animatronic gives the player so many problems since it is extremely quick in it's movements and often sticks to the hidden areas of the room it is in making it difficult to spot. And while it is the only real creepy killer you have to worry about, the addition of Phantom animatronics that are figments of your imagination and won't kill you makes up for the lack of physical entities that want to kill you. And of course, the fact that the systems you use can't be used indefinitely and must always be restored is a great feature and one that builds the tension and fear since it gives the animatronic a chance to advance closer to you. Overall a surprisingly fantastic addition to the Five Nights at Freddy's series and while I heavily suspect it is the last due to there being multiple endings that tie in with the dark and mysterious story, I will always remember these games as being a great example of how sometimes in scary games like these, it is not just all about the frights and spooks.","March 11, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Como os outros, você deve ficar cinco noites de vigia no local. E também como os outros games, os animatrônicos saem para te matar e você precisa se proteger. No local, temos um monitor com os status dos sistemas de ventilação, visor e som que são muito importantes durante a Gameplay. Sempre que um dos sistemas se corrompe ou quebra, você manualmente conserta eles clicando no sistema. Temor o monitor das câmeras, símbolo icônico da série FNAF e o único animatrônico presente no local: Spring Trap ou a carcaça de Purple Guy Ambulante se preferir. Ele é distraído se o player ativar o som disponível no monitor de câmeras, Spring Trap pode entrar nos "vents" então feche ele caso acontecer. Há também os "Phantom Animatronics" que são versões dos outros robôs dos outros games da série: Freddy, Balloon Boy (ARGH!), Chica, Foxy, The Puppet e The Mangle, por incrível que pareça. Esses irão te assustar e atingir os sistemas dos monitores.\nGráficos Excelentes embora de que as câmeras não parem de dar problema; sons, coisa importante em FNAF, "remelhorada" agora; Gameplay Instável; Jumpscares bem feitos e um final digno para o game. FNAF 3 não ganhou muitos pontos no Metacritic mas conseguiu ganhar carisma pelos fãs. Não importa qual critica for, Five Night At Freddy's 3 trouxe novamente o elemento de terror psicológico, e lindamente.","October 4, 2015","true","1.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

(That sounds so easy!) Well....your wrong. You have a mechanic which you have to reboot, audio devices, camera system and ventilation (every once in a while). So you can not just stare at the camera and everytime he leaves just bring him back to the room. (Unless you have unlocked cheats and have No Errors on) The gameplay itself is fun but at times it can be boring (and repetive).\nGameplay: 7/10\n\nVisuals/Graphics\n--------------------------\n\nOver the 3 games, the visuals have been improved. Springtrap himself looks nice and stands out from the other games.\nNothing much to say.\nVisuals/Graphics: 8.5/10\n\n\nMechanics\n------------------------\n\nReboot System\n---------------\nThis is what kills you most of the time. If you have all 3 errors, you are basically screwed but if you are fast enough, you could make it. The reboot system is a nice mechanic that was planned by Scott since FNAF 1. I hate it when Springtrap is in the vents and I am busy rebooting all and when I am done, I get jumpscared by him. (Talk about bad timing..) It's apperance is nice and it is smooth...GG.\n\nPlay Audio\n----------------\nThis will save your life. Luring him away from you from room to room. But, if you can't find him on the cameras, it is a certain death. The audio recharges slowly or quickly depending on the night. It's a nice mechanic and can be effective.\n\nVents Sealing\n---------------\nNot a lot to say but it's very helpful when his in CAM 15 and all the other vent cams. Well...again it's a nice mechanic.\n\n\nSpringtrap and Hallucinations\n------------------------------------\n\nNow, Springtrap is fairly deadly, he likes to move around a lot and also likes to kill you A LOT.  What confuses me is, shouldn't it be called Five Nights At Springtrap's? :P He is essentially the main antagonist....anyways he is a huge jerk and that's that.\n\nThe hallucinations however are very annoying, trying to keep track of Springtrap but BB just jumpscares you followed by Chica...then freddy. GOD DAMN THOSE HALLUCINATIONS!\n\n\nOverall\n--------------\nOverall, the game is enjoyble and scary (especially when you are playing for the first time) ;)\nOverall: 8.5/10\n\nFNAF 4? ;)\n\n\n","March 7, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Like I liked the first cuz' it was new and really creepy. The second was way too hard and the gameplay was not very well designed. And there were too many things trying to kill you. But in this one there's only one. I know that might sound kinda boring, but there's many different ways he can kill you. And unlike the other games, instead of trying to get the animatronics OUT of your office, you try to KEEP Springtrap (The main antagonist) out. So, in order to do that, there's a little button on the cameras that you press and it plays an audio that will keep Sprigtrap in place for a little bit. But every 2 - 3 times you click the audio button, it will run out of charge and you'll have to reboot it. And while you doing that Springtrap might take a shortcut through a vent to your office. You can close the vents, but you can only have one closed at a time. Also every once in a while you'll need to let some air in, which you can do the same way you reboot the audio devices, with the maintenance panel. If you don't let air in, you'll see multiple Springtraps all over the cameras. This gives the real Springtrap a good advantage to kill you. The camera will also go blurry from time to time, but that can be rebooted too. There are also phantoms that can cause ventilation errors, and different ways to provent that from happening. So anyway, this game is the best, most fun, and creepyest of all the games. If your bored of the other games, or just bored, this is a good game to get and it's completely family friendly exept for it's really scary. Anyway I vote 368/10","August 9, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Not even scary when it comes into the room. It's just kind of like "Hey man, the bathroom is outta toilet paper so I'm just gonna head to the store real quick and buy some. Came in to see if you had another 5 bucks on ya' that I could borrow."\n\nAnd the other time he's just like "Boo! Hah, totally TRIED to scare you dude.

So, in order to do that, there's a little button on the cameras that you press and it plays an audio that will keep Sprigtrap in place for a little bit. But every 2 - 3 times you click the audio button, it will run out of charge and you'll have to reboot it. And while you doing that Springtrap might take a shortcut through a vent to your office. You can close the vents, but you can only have one closed at a time. Also every once in a while you'll need to let some air in, which you can do the same way you reboot the audio devices, with the maintenance panel. If you don't let air in, you'll see multiple Springtraps all over the cameras. This gives the real Springtrap a good advantage to kill you. The camera will also go blurry from time to time, but that can be rebooted too. There are also phantoms that can cause ventilation errors, and different ways to provent that from happening. So anyway, this game is the best, most fun, and creepyest of all the games. If your bored of the other games, or just bored, this is a good game to get and it's completely family friendly exept for it's really scary. Anyway I vote 368/10","August 9, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game's not better than the first game, but it IS better than the second.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Five Nights at Freddy's is a horror / strategy game about you being a security guard and doing the night-shift at a pizzeria called "Freddy Fazbear's Pizza." Each night, you get a phone call from a guy nicknamed "Phone Guy." He gives you hints and tips on "how to survive" the night. On Night 1 in the 1st game, he tells you that the animatronics (Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy) will, for an unknown reason, recognize you as an endoskeleton (not exoskeleton) without its costume on. Apparently that's against the rules, so they will attempt to enter your office, and try to forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy suit, full of wires, sharp things, et cetera. You have a monitor, which you can use to see where the animatronics are, and if you're lucky, some easter eggs.\n\nIn the second game (SPOILERS!! It's a prequel), there are 11 animatronics!! These include: Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, Toy Freddy, Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica (who people have a crush on for "some" reason), The Mangle, Balloon Boy, The Puppet (not the Marionette...) and Golden Freddy, who is ONLY active on Night 6 & 7 (Spoilers). You can figure out this one's story yourself, because it's about 10 to 10 at night! Anyways, there are some new stuff in this game. These include a flashlight, used for seeing into the vents, hallway and monitor screens, a Freddy mask, used for... you can guess what it's used for, and finally a music-box, which if not wound up for long enough will activate a certain animatronic who will attack you and cannot be stopped.\n\nFinally, the third game. A sequel to the first game. This one is VERY perplexing, if you don't know what you're doing. Doors, the mask and the flashlight have been removed, but some interesting features have been added. There is an audio device, which can be used to lure the new animatronic (called Springtrap, not Golden Bonnie) away from your office. There is a maintennance pannel, which can be used to fix anything that goes offline (audio devices, the camera system and the ventilation). And, you can now seal parts of the vents, preventing Springtrap from going through them. You can only seal one vent at a time, though, making the game more challenging. BUT, Springtrap isn't alone... The other animatronics include: Phantom BB, Phantom Chica, Phantom Foxy, Phantom Freddy, Phantom Mangle and the Phantom Puppet. These animatronics cannot kill you, but they can still jumpscare you and sometimes disable one of your devices, therefore you need to use the maintennance pannel. They can also make Springtrap get into your office easier, which is a BIG problem...\n\nThere are three endings to Five Nights at Freddy's 3. The Bad Ending (which you WILL get), the Good Ending (VERY hard to get) and the secret ending. You can figure out how to get the good and secret ending, because I'd be up ALL night typing how to achieve them. P.S. You get a star on the main menu for completing each end.\n\nThank you to those people who took their time to read this review! Hopefully it would've persuaded you to get FNaF! Maybe even all three games! ;)","March 9, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well, this is my analysis: (The note is from the one to ten with decimals)\n\nDifficulty: 9,5. The challenge level is good, because Springtrap is so active, the problems of the system and the hallucinations of BB, because BB screams you with screamers, sorry for the redundancy. But, no "power left" and that takes away difficulty.\n\nPlayability: 6. The playability is 6, because, sometimes is very slow, for example, when the system have a problem, it takes to rotates and when we review the cameras, see ventilation ducts is too slow, but, that does not detract from the quality of this indie game.But, the positive part is the console of the system, that is good and the audio apparently serves to scare Springtrap, and that also is good, also the ducts is good.\n\nFun: 10. The game is tense and fun, because, this game is interactive (more than FNaF2) and the console of the system is something "novedoso" and "colorido" (as they say in Mexico). (seek meaning in Google).\n\nStory: 10. I have nothing to say, this is what stands the series (and the game), the story has an air of suspense and mystery. Regarding games, also a mysterious air becomes.\n\nHorror: 9,9. This is a game having a high level of horror. Despite its simple design and its "click & point" is a "bigga horra surviva game". But, some of the popular horror survival games is the blood, but it is something that goes unnoticed.\n\nFinal note: 9.1. This game is a great horror survival game of this year, because the game have a high level of difficulty, horror, story, fun and the playability i is equally good. This game deserves an award (and the serie equal)\n\n","March 2, 2015","true","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Well, this is my analysis: (The note is from the one to ten with decimals)\n\nDifficulty: 9,5. The challenge level is good, because Springtrap is so active, the problems of the system and the hallucinations of BB, because BB screams you with screamers, sorry for the redundancy. But, no "power left" and that takes away difficulty.\n\nPlayability: 6. The playability is 6, because, sometimes is very slow, for example, when the system have a problem, it takes to rotates and when we review the cameras, see ventilation ducts is too slow, but, that does not detract from the quality of this indie game.But, the positive part is the console of the system, that is good and the audio apparently serves to scare Springtrap, and that also is good, also the ducts is good.\n\nFun: 10. The game is tense and fun, because, this game is interactive (more than FNaF2) and the console of the system is something "novedoso" and "colorido" (as they say in Mexico). (seek meaning in Google).\n\nStory: 10. I have nothing to say, this is what stands the series (and the game), the story has an air of suspense and mystery. Regarding games, also a mysterious air becomes.\n\nHorror: 9,9. This is a game having a high level of horror. Despite its simple design and its "click & point" is a "bigga horra surviva game". But, some of the popular horror survival games is the blood, but it is something that goes unnoticed.\n\nFinal note: 9.1. This game is a great horror survival game of this year, because the game have a high level of difficulty, horror, story, fun and the playability i is equally good. This game deserves an award (and the serie equal)\n\n","March 2, 2015","true","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

This is an awesome game!" It's also very confusing. The directions on how to play, and why you have to play that way are very vague. So it leaves a lot for us gamers to figure out. I hardly ever get scared in games, especially these ones... no offence Scott ;) but MAN my first jumpscare in this game probably had me jump 3 feet in the air! I love how things actually move in this game! It gives it a wonderful sense of dread. "Omg... did I just see him run past me? No? Okay i'm fiiiiinee.... *Springtrap jumps out from the wrong side* OMG OMG OMG. This game nearly gave me a heart attack. 10/10 would play again with a defibrillator near by!\n\nOn a side note, has anyone found what would be considered the "good ending"?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/squattopandtacos/recommended/354140/","squattopandtacos","squattop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/squattopandtacos/","48 products in account","So, I highly recommend this game, especially if you enjoyed the first two. If you didn't enjoy the first two, I think you'll enjoy this one. One of the many "complaints" of the first two games were the fact you really only need to look at one cam in each game (Pirate Cove in FNAF1 and Prize Room in FNAF2). That's different in this game, especially in the harder levels. You will need to be constantly looking through the room cams and the vent cams to find him and trap him or lead him away from you. There also is only one animatronic trying to kill you, the rest are just hallucinations which will cost you time and disable a system.\n\nI've put quite some time into this game, with only about 2.5 hours into playing Nights 1-5 (getting the first and third stars) and the other 6.4 (currently at 8.9 hours) into trying to beat Nightmare mode (which I just finished and got the final star!). Now I have plenty of time to hunt for Easter Eggs :3\n\nOnce you get the hang of the game, Nights 1-4 are a walk in the park with Night 5 still putting up a fight and Nightmare mode (Night 6) being an absolute challenge, especially if you have bad luck or a bad strategy. There are [spoliler]4 Cheats[/spoiler] available once you get all 3 stars, 3 of which make the game easier and 1 of which make the game harder (I think; it's called Aggressive so I believe it adds aggression rather than takes it away), so there's fun to be had with that.\n\nAll-in-all I'd give this game an 8.9/10 and there's a few spoilers about some of the stuff in game for those of you who want to know a little more.\n\nSo first off, we've established there are three stars and here's how you get them: 1st (get the bad ending or just beat the game, not sure which), 2nd (beat Nightmare mode), and the 3rd (get the "good" end). YES THERE ARE TWO ENDINGS (plus a neutral third once you beat Nightmare) and your actions in Nights 1-5 determine which one you get. The end minigame is the end, but the picture is different and you an unlock in the extras. So as far as extras go there's Animatronics (their models) for getting the first star, Jumpscares for getting the second star, minigames for getting the third star, and as stated above Cheats for getting all three stars.[/spoilers] The cheats are  Fast Nights (nights go by faster, I have yet to use it but I assume it's either at 1.5x speed or 2x speed), Radar (which puts a red circle on the cam Springtrap is in), Aggressive (which I assume adds aggression instead of taking it away), and No Errors (pretty simple just no errors).","March 4, 2015","true","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In FNaF 1, you could just check the east hall corner or just check foxy depending on the strategy you use. In FNaF 2, the only camera you had to go to was the prize counter to wind up the music box. But in this one, since you need to know where Spring Trap is, you need to check around until you find him.\n\nI am also one of those who wish there were more variations of the jumpscares to keep things interesting. After an hour trying to beat night 3, I'm finally able to get scared without my mom in the other room wondering if I'm alright. Maybe more will be patched in.\n\nI'd also like to take the time to point out the random crashes when a night tries to start up. Sometimes it starts, sometimes it doesn't. Update: This has been fixed by Scott and has been patched in version 1.01.\n\nAlso, it seems like this game does require a bit of luck. You don't want Springtrap to be in the vents while an error occurs. That pretty much guarantees that you're dead. It takes so long for something to reset that it often becomes the reason you fail. This quickly becomes annoying. I'm close to the point to not even wanting to play it until an update occurs that balances those mechanics. I'm currently stuck on night 5.\n\nIt seems like SpringTrap is either very overpowered or I simply have the worst luck.  Or I'm just doing something completely wrong. After all, sometimes, when I play audio in room near SpringTrap, sometimes he goes to that room. Other times, he continues to waltz straight into my room and catch me. When it does work, I've been managing to keep SpringTrap in the same few rooms, so I think I'm onto a good strategy. I just happens that sometimes, errors time themselves against me and cause me to let SpringTrap in.\n\nNot to mention, he seems to start in random places, and sometimes, I cannot find him at all. I'm sure I've learned all his hiding places. He just doesn't show up anywhere sometimes. It get incredibly frustrating. It's more frustrating than scary after you've played this for two hours.\n\nQuite honestly, I would have bought my friend Luke his own copy. But, not anymore. Not after re-examining everything I loath about this game.","March 4, 2015","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(Fnaf 2) Check vents, check hall, wind up box, put mask on, check vents, flash hall, wind music box. At least to me, finding a spot in which I can keep Springtrap without him entering a vent, leading me back to square one involves a lot more brain power than the first one.\n\nThe addition of animations in the game is fantastic. It makes the game feel 5x scarier, especially since it takes full use of perifferal (There is no way I spelt that right) vision. Seeing Springtrap peer in around the corner to then quickly hide behind the wall before you are able to make out what it was is amazing to the atmosphere. Freddy walking by the window definitely made me freak out a little  A lot  and may or may not of resulted in my death, and don't get me started abouut the hallucinations. The fact that you can get jumped without dieing, adds an aspect of scariness that was not in the other games. After the jump scare, that was it, where as with many of the scares in the third game don't kill you, giving you almost no time to recover in which you have to fix the vent situation and still keep an eye on what will kill you.\n\nI highly reccomend if you are looking for a quick scare.\n\nPlaying it more and more, I am running into the problem of the game crashing while trying to start the night. It is rather annoying, but since it is easy to get back into it, its not that big a negative. I just wish the bug was not there.","March 4, 2015","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
