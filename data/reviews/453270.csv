It can be played offline or online. The game features micro-transactions. You can play PVP or co-op with other players to do your missions.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics are standard block graphics similar to the numerous games like Minecraft, Guncraft etc. The framerate was good throughout my gameplay with this game.\n\nSound:\n\nWhile the music is decent it can get repetitive as there is not much variety. The time i played only one track played the entire time. The sound of enemies, shooting, even zombie sounds are not that impressive.\n\nGameplay:\n\nYou can play solo or go online with friends to co-op, or join random servers. There are missions available which you can do. You will earn cash. You can also earn cash by converting coins to cash and guess what, these coins can be bought using real life money. This is a big no in my book and probably one of the main reasons I am not recommending this game. Another reason I won’t recommend this game is, it’s not entirely in English. Some stuff is in English while the rest is in Russian.\nThe missions are simple such as kill x number of zombies, collect x number of secret documents, last x number of minutes in waves of enemies. There’s a large variety of weapons available in the game. Your character levels up and weapons require you to be certain level. Overall, it got really boring for me fast and I wanted to move on and play other game. The game does have potential but a lot of things need improvement.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe game has potential but in the current state I cannot recommend it. It has micro-transactions and it’s not even entirely in English. See screenshot below of me trying to upgrade a weapon and presented with Russian text and I have no clue what it says. These things really put me off and I didn’t play the game much due to that. The bits I played I did enjoy some parts, the weapons were fun to use and some of the missions can be fun but not recommended overall in it's current state.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=698774129","June 6","false","1.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

A lot of missions, a large selection of cards for construction. Game vs zombies. The PvP mode. You can create any maps. Play it with your friends or build together. Huge selection of weapons, characters. If you are tired of repetitive games, play Madness Cubed. You will like it.
