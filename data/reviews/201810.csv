"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197969376654/recommended/201810/","76561197969376654","Codename_Kaboom","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197969376654/","410 products in account","Update 5/21: My system specs are as follows: Intel i5 2500K @ 3.3GHZ, 32 GB sys ram, 1TB HDD, Windows 8.1, Nvdida Drivers 335.23 ( I know they aren't the latest drivers, but I don't upgrade my drivers until I have trouble playing a game because  I've found sometimes new drivers can cause problems with games that were working fine).\n\nThis is a solid title. No doubts about it. The rumors about the AI being poor don't hold up to what I've experienced so far. Enemies will take cover, duck out to take shots, roll to make themselves harder targets, and commanders will even continuously call in reinforcements until they are killed. I started at "Hard" difficulty and it feels like the right setting for veteran gamers. One potential issue that can make the game easier is that there is a bit of overabundance in terms of medkits and armor for my taste. Every time you clear an area, you'll find that there are significant numbers of health, ammo, and armor picks-up scattered all around. Of course, you can be as judicious as you like in terms of how many you take, but they could have scaled back on the amount of pick-up a bit.\n\nThe visuals are generally very solid, with the occasional glitch here and there, and the framerate is smooth and steady. The only complaint I have in this regard is that there is still random screen tearing, even with V-Sync enabled, but it's rare, and hasn't really significantly impacted my experience. I have a GTX 660 with 32 gigs of system RAM.\n\nI am still early on, but man does this game have atmosphere and some of the best voice acting I have experienced yet. And the cutscenes are quite well done.\n\nThe guns are fun so far, but I haven't yet really got anything exotic.  We'll see how that turns out with additional game time, though.\n\nAt any rate, the short of it is get this game if you enjoy FPSs. I am having some really good fun with this one, and I'm about to get back to it now! I'll update this review as needed.\n\nCheers!\n\nUpdate: Made it into the castle proper, and the ♥♥♥♥ really hits the fan in terms of the cruelty and burtuality of the nazis. The game has a real sense of drama and solid pacing. They have created some of the creepiest, most warped characters I've seen in a while...Well done, Machine Games!\n\nSome folks were concerned about it being too linear, but I really think they did a wonderful job of making it linear without making it seem claustrophobic. The level design is very well done, with just enough nooks and crannies to make you want to see what's down that corridor that's off the main path...\n\nUpdate 5/20: I am about 12-13 hours in now, and my initial impressions still hold. This game is a generally solid FPS experience. There's nothing revolutionary here, but it does what it does well. I forgot to mention that you can earn perks as you progress through the game, and the perks are aligned with different playstyles. For example, there is a perk line for stealth that allows you to increase some of the stealth actions at your disposal (i.e. throwing knives) or to improve upon them (i.e. reduce the amount of noise you make when you sprint). Also, all projectile weapons have alternate fire modes , but you have to unlock them through gameplay. I still recommend veteran gamers starting on at least "Hard".\n\nUpdate 6/3/14: This update is about the weapons, now that I have had a chance to really sink my teeth in the game. There is some variety to be had here in terms of weapons, but you won't see the more exotic weapons (i.e. laser rifles) until much later on in the game. This could be an issue for those of us who are "gun bunnies", and want access sooner rather than later, but I wouldn't let that put you off from what is really a great game. You do get some incremental upgrades to the primary stable of weapons you have access to early on, which include (but are not limited to) the usual suspects like an assault rifle, shotgun, and pistols (which can be actively silenced at will). One such incremental improvement is the addition of a grenade launcher to the standard assault rifle. So, it's not a new weapon, but it definitely adds some additional punch to your damage output, not the mention the fun factor when you want to turn up the heat.\n\nI should also note here that you can dual-wield most of your weapons, and, though I take the stealth route for the most part, I have had some solid fun with full-on assualts while dual-wielding shotguns and assualt rifles.","May 19, 2014","true","37.9"," 1,308 of 1,468 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","308","1","0","65"

Here I am a year later eating those words, as Wolfenstein: The New Order is most probably my game of the year for 2014.\n\nSerious Sam style over-the-top one-man-army gameplay that feels amazing, with a meaty arsenal of weapons (all of which can be dual-wielded) and a heavy reliance on health and armour pickups as opposed to health regeneration.\n\nThe alternate post-WW2 setting is also incredibly well realised, with varied and interesting locales that stay interesting over the course of the games 8-10 hour length.  Not to mention the game's soundtrack featuring Nazi-fied versions of famous real world songs is worth a look on its own.\n\nCombined with a surprisingly well told story featuring characters that you'll actually care about (with special mention going to Brian Bloom's performance as BJ Blazkowicz) makes this the freshest single player FPS I've played this generation. Hands down.\n\nIf you're even remotely interested in this game, pick it up. I hope you'll be as blown away as I was.","November 6, 2014","true","31.0"," 384 of 408 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","384","408","9","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/201810/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","It turns out that Wolfenstein: The New Order wasn’t quite what I expected. I figured it’d be an over-the-top, vaguely ridiculous game about shooting Nazis with improbably large weapons, which never really took itself too seriously. In actual fact, it’s a game about shooting Nazis with improbably large weapons, which occasionally takes itself entirely seriously. I’m not sure I’d ever say it’s subtle or understated, but it tries to do a bit more than the bare minimum.\n\nYes, there are battles against cyborg dogs and men in giant robot suits. Yes, there’s a degree of mysticism – or at least, there are ancient Jewish weapons of mass destruction. Yes, there are German covers of The Beatles songs, and yes, there are some laughably macho one-liners. There’s a lot of faintly ridiculous stuff in here.\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order casts you as B. J. Blazkowicz, an utterly gigantic American whose LinkedIn profile contains hundreds of endorsements for his skills at murdering Nazis. The game kicks off in a 1946 level as dull as it is brown; at this point, the Nazis are winning World War 2 due to technology hundreds of years in advance of what they should have. Things do not go according to plan, and Blazkowicz spends the next 14 years in a vegetative state, returning to his senses only when the hospital he’s in is closed down and he’s about to be unceremoniously “purged” as a sub-human. In 1960, the Nazi regime rules the world… which just means there are even more Nazis for Blazkowicz to kill than before.And that, really, is your job. Kill Nazis, find the resistance, kill Nazis, help find a way to fight back against the Nazi menace, and kill Nazis. Also, kill Nazis.\n\nKilling Nazis can primarily be accomplished in one of two ways. You can opt for the guns-out route, charging around levels firing wildly and rabidly slaughtering everything in your path, or you can opt to take a more stealthy route, sneaking around and stabbing them in the neck. More than likely, you’ll have to employ both at different times – and not just when the game commands you to go for one playstyle or another.\n\nThe main reason for this is the presence of Nazi Commanders, who are cowardly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that continually call for reinforcements if they spot you. In any area containing these guys, you’ll at the very least want to make sure you know where they are before the alarms go off so that you can make a beeline to them and cut them down. Still, you can either charge directly for them guns blazing, or sneak your way through and stab them in the skull. Both options are entirely viable, and unlike most FPS games with enforced stealth sections, the stealth here actually works.\n\nYou’ve got a wide variety of weapons, almost all of which can be dual-wielded, and all of which have alternate firing modes. You can lurk around a corner and blast away with an automatic shotgun equipped with shrapnel shells that ricochet. You can pull out a pair of assault rifles, switch one of them to its rocket launching alt-fire mode, and go to town. You can peek out from behind cover with a marskman rifle, or use your Laserkraftwerk to turn Nazis into a messy red smear. All of these weapons have a satisfying sound and satisfying impact.\n\nThe biggest problem facing Wolfenstein: The New Order is that there isn’t a huge amount which stands out and makes it exceptional. There are some excellent segments like the trailed train scene, some fun locations, a lot of backstory in the form of newspaper clippings, plenty of hidden items to find and bonuses to unlock, a number of tragic moments underpinned by some excellent writing… but for the most part, it’s just an extremely well-assembled game that marries stealth and adrenaline-pumping over-the-top action far better than you might expect.\n\nIf there is one genuinely bad thing, though, it’s probably idTech 5. My first time through the game I actually suffered relatively few problems, although Wolfenstein: The New Order was clearly chewing through my hardware like a starving man at a buffet. The second time was a bit more problematic: tearing was abundant, lip-synching was out of time with the audio, texture pop-in was noticeable, and there was a weird multi-coloured haze flashing around fast-moving characters.\n\nI’d argue it’s probably the best Wolfenstein game since 1992’s Wolfenstein 3D. It’s just that, good as it is, it’s not mind-blowingly spectacular. Wolfenstein: The New Order is a solid, highly-polished shooter that’ll provide around a dozen hours of entertainment, with a unique setting, some good writing, and strong mechanics. That’s all it is, but that’s no bad thing.","October 23, 2014","true","135.0"," 815 of 914 people (89%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","89","815","914","60","20"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/201810/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","389 products in account","Wolfenstein: The New Order is pretty metal, I guess.\n\nSo, a few weeks ago I found myself without internet. Not knowing what to do with my life outside of do heroine I was going to a pawn shop to get a gun so I can just turn it all off. There I encountered Wolfestein: The New Order buried in a box of various other Nazi paraphernalia. It was either gun or the game, I went with the game. Yes, I know, I should have gone with the gun.\n\nWolfenstein: The Last Guardian starts in 1946 during a joint allied air assault on Deathshead's compound after the Nazi's dropped all of that D&D ♥♥♥♥ from the previous games and settled down on cold hard science. The assault probably would have worked if it wasn't for the giant robot dog. Also, they should have attacked the ground, not the air. Good job America, there are no Nazi's up there.\n\nYet.\n\nYou play as JC Denton. I mean B.J. Blazkowicz. A very handsome man from the previous games who seems to be unable to go a few minutes without killing a Nazi. B.J. accompanies the allied attack force to the Deathshead compound where he proves that he is the only person competent enough to use his gun. Everything goes wrong and B.J. is left with a shard of metal in his head the size of my kidney stones and remains a prisoner in his own body for dozens of years. Much like my kidney stones.\n\nNow in 1960, B.J. Wakes up after he smells Nazi and once again continues his one man army slaughter of Astral-Lich Hitler's entire army. On this adventure, B.J. meets new friends, discovers new and wonderful places, and learns the true meaning of forgiveness.\n\nHaha, I'm just joshing you, he kills a lot of people.\n\nAnd killing Nazi's is something B.J. is really good at. Unlike most of the wimps that plague shooters these days, our all American psychopath is more than capable of carrying more than two guns at any given time, even two of various guns to be exact. And good thing too since the guns pretty much make the game.\n\nEach and every gun has this umph to it, a crunch if you will. Shooting them and hitting something looks like it hurts, something a good number of shooters these days seems to lack. Isn't that right, Bioshock:Infinite? You disgrace. Your enemies react to being shot, stumbling and fumbling in a way that makes you feel sorry for any poor mook you manage to hit.  Each gun has competent damage and it's hard to pick out a favorite. But it's gonna be the assault rifle because...I mean...Come on look at it, this thing is friggin awesome.\n\nOn B.J.'s mass murder adventures, you meet all kinds of new and interesting Nazi's to shoot. Such as.\n-Nazi.\n-Super Nazi\n-large Nazi\n-Angry Robot Nazi\n-Angry Robot Dog Nazi\n-Uncomfortably sexual Nazi Lady\n-Uncomfortably sexual Nazi boy.\nAnd who could forget.\n-Muscle Nazi.\n\n“But Dirk, you incredibly charismatic man who crackles with sexual energy.” You ask. “How could you have beaten the game if you only have 2 hours on Steam?”\n\nWhile I agree that I crackle with sexual energy, I still didn't have the internet when I played this game. None of my time was actually logged, but I assure you, that I played this game from start to finish.\n\nBut should you play Wolfenstein: The recent book club?\n\nYes, you should. Wolfenstein is everything a shooter should be. While I do miss the amazing multiplayer from Return or Enemy Territories. The game more than makes up for it with it's satisfying gun play and return to form with it's love for said satisfying gun play. Wolfenstein knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else. You can be stealthy if you really want, and sometimes that's fun too, but come on, look at what they give you to work with, it's screaming at you to just let lose and tear someone a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nWolfenstein: The current Chess Match gets 17 men screaming in German out of a possible 17 and the Dickbutt golden award. It's just an Emmy I found in Bill Murry's trash that I drew a mustache on. But it's still a very prestigious award.\n\nThe Curator, sometimes I update it: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","October 1, 2015","true","2.2"," 919 of 1,101 people (83%) found this review helpful 951 people found this review funny","83","919","1","951","28"

And that was unexpected, to me, after all, who expects anything from a Wolfenstein, especially after Wolf 2009? As a sequel-reboot, this game is all parts visceral, gritty, and smart.\nThe story is simple, of course- what if the Nazis had won WW2 with a little help from some ancient technology so advanced as to seem supernatural? That's the game's only hook into its mystic past. That's where the simplicity ends- the story is brilliant and brutal, told initially through the eyes of BJ, an invalid, forced to watch from his wheelchair as the Nazis take over the world, systematically killing everyone they deem untermensch. It's enough to give you great catharsis when he finally stands up from his chair. The characters are superbly animated and acted, giving real life to the world. BJ is actually cast as something of the typical action hero, optimistic and unsuited for the gritty world he finds himself in, it works.\nThe gameplay is pretty standard FPS faire. It's got enough enemies for BJ to mow down to harken back to earlier Wolf, you can even wield akimbo weapons owing to BJ being a meathead. Enemy variety is good and the level design is impressive, often monolithic Nazi architecture though there are several excursions to unique locations- concentration camps, U-boats, the Nazi moonbase, etc. It's even got a decent length for a singleplayer FPS these days, about 20 hours.\nDon't pass this up.

In this game, you will have to defeat the Nazi forces once more. In it, you take control of Captain B.J. Blazkowicz, an American War Hero and the last hope to defeat the monstrous Nazi regime, which is packed with tons of foes, including Super Soldiers and Nazi Robots.\n\nGameplay\n\nFor me the gameplay is near perfection, it is definitely where this game really shines. Everything about the shooting mechanics works like a charm. It really gives you the feel of playing an old-school First-person shooter, while being up to today standards. You have a nice variety of weapons to cause massive mayhem and destruction. Yet you can also try to go stealth which also is very well done, but the shooting in this game is so awesome that you probably wont go stealth. You also can dual-wield some weapons, which feels awesome too. Also enjoyed the boss battles a lot, one of them gave me a pretty good challenge. The AI was nothing exceptional though, sometimes during stealth sections they were pretty blind. Nevertheless, it is a really exceptional game gameplay wise, except for 2 things that bugged me. The laser cut sections, which got lame after a while into the game and the perk system since it is very bland. I wished they had put a little more effort in it but oh well...\n\nStory\n\nThe story is also very competent. It is very interesting to see this "what if nazis won World War 2" approach. Plus the game has tons of extremely interesting characters with great writing to support it, which make the story of this game work incredibly well. An excellent surprise.\n\nGraphics and Performance\n\nGraphically this game is nothing special for a next-gen game. Yet the visuals work extremely well, with some amazing level design and scenarios, from underwater sections to the moon (yea you heard it right, the fricking moon). Unfortunately the performance was not very smooth as in all games that run in id Tech 5 engine. Played it on Max Settings around 50 fps at 1440x900 res in my medium specs rig (see my profile for specs), with the game having some noticeable breaks, but nothing that ruined my experience. The game comes packed with plenty of settings to tweak, so you probably wont have a problem playing it properly.\n\nLongevity\n\nLongevity is nice for a single-player only First-person shooter, but definitely nothing impressive. I completed it in about 10 hours on normal difficulty, but I missed tons of collectibles, so I will probably replay it soon. It also as an interesting story choice right at the beginning of the game that affects the game, story-wise, so it can be played 2 times due to some interesting differences in the playthrough.\n\nMusic and Sounds\n\nThe Sound department in this game is near perfect. All sounds felt right - gunfire, explosions, everything basically. Also the voice acting is top notch as the soundtrack. A really well done job in the sound department.\n\nSummary\nPros:\nEpic and extremely satisfying old-school combat mechanics\nStealth feels good\nGreat sound design\nAwesome characters and writing\nInteresting story and lore\nCons:\nLaser cutter sections\nAI seems blind sometimes\nMy personal score: 8.0/10\n\nIt´s been a long time since I played a First-person shooter this fun. The combat is so satisfying, they really nailed it. If you like old-school FPS games, you will love this one. A really well executed game with amazing gameplay. Highly recommended to fans of FPS games!\n\n----------------------------\nAnálise em Português no site eyeoctane.org / Portuguese Review in eyeoctane.org : http://eyeoctane.org/index.php/2015/10/14/analise-wolfenstein-the-new-order/","September 25, 2015","true","9.4"," 285 of 356 people (80%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","80","285","356","28","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/201810/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","Wolfenstein: The New Order is a game with a story that begins in 1946, then fast-forwards to 1960. The Nazis won the war in 1946, the Allies lost, so that Nazis have taken over the world. The introduction to the narrative is long enough that it takes a long time for B.J. Blazkowicz, the main protagonist of the Wolfenstein series, to carry firearms. Mr. Blazkowicz fought in the war for the U.S., but was wounded and spends time in a Polish mental institution in a vegetative state until 1960.\n\nThis game is a continuation of the famous Wolfenstein series that has no shame in allowing you to kill as many Nazis as possible. Cities like Berlin and London are now occupied by Nazis as technological terrors such as large mechs and robotic dogs patrol the streets. There are many propaganda posters strewn throughout Germany and London, England making it clear that the Nazis are ruling and that citizens who violate their laws will be severely punished. Mr. Blazkowicz is the man who will take on the Nazis with some help from NPCs who will advise him on where to go and what objectives to complete. Killing Nazis is in his DNA.\n\nThe narrative requires you to choose one of two paths that will be slightly different from each other based on which two comrades will die at the hands of evil General Deathshead, the leader of the Nazis. Deathshead kills one of the two comrades you choose for death so that he can use him in an evil experiment that he says will change the world for the better. You will then have to play the game based on the survivor’s timeline. This ability to choose may be cruel, but it adds replayability to the game by encouraging you to play the game twice so that you can experiences both timelines that result in slightly different versions of the narrative.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much an old school FPS. The weapons in the game are not innovative, but they still feel very satisfying and have alternate modes. The run –of-the-mill weapons include handguns, assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles. Each aforementioned weapon can be upgraded and the upgrades will be necessary to take on the bigger and more powerful Nazis. Assault rifles feel powerful when dual wielding them and can be upgraded by acquiring the rocket upgrade. There are perks in the game that you can keep track of that Mr. Blazkowicz can acquire throughout the game to improve the stealth, tactical, assault, and demolition aspects of combat. These perks add a role-playing like feel to the game. The ability to pick up ammo, weapons, health, and armor feels a like old school FPS.\n\nThere are certain locales that seem to encourage stealth. This is when the knife comes in handy, allowing you to slash unsuspecting Nazis from behind. The slashings are truly gory and horrific, but satisfying since it feels like they deserve to be slashed by your blade. Some locales can overwhelm you to death if you don’t use stealth, especially if there are officers stationed there. You can detect signals that alert you to the presence of officers. Officers are capable of calling in reinforcements to overwhelm. Stealthily taking down officers is rewarding as the game’s map will open up and reveals secret items such as enigma codes, letters, and gold items. There are other locales that seem to encourage a shootout with Nazis of different sizes and abilities. Nazis are varied enough in terms of clothing and weapons. Some Nazis are powerful rocket wielding and shotgun wielding foes that will seriously test your FPS skills such as the ability to take cover. The levels are varied enough as they include a prison that you must infiltrate, a lunar base run by Nazis, the city of London filled with swastikas to indicate Nazi dominance, and a base occupied by Mr. Blazkowicz’s friends where he receive objectives. It is interesting to see an alternate perspective of World War II with the Nazis winning the war and dominating the world. They actually landed on the moon before the U.S. could ever land one of its own citizens on the moon.\n\nI have always been of the opinion that characters in games should speak their native language. This game nails it by having Nazis speak German when engaged in combat. It makes the game feel more immersive than if they all spoke the English language in a setting that is German. Some of Blazkowicz’s friends speak German and say a few words in German. I felt like I was truly in Germany when the Nazis spoke German during combat. The A.I. is not always perfect, but it is good enough to test your FPS abilities in the spur of the moment.\n\nOne new weapon in the game is the laser cutter known as the laserkraftwerk (LKW). When you first acquire this weapon, it is a utility that can be used to cut holes in metal gratings that block your progress. There are other metal gratings that can be cut for the purpose of finding secret items. Once it is upgraded the LKW becomes more than a utility item: it then contains an alternate mode which is a weapon that is very effective against mechanical enemies. They don’t require ammo since they run on batteries that can be recharged at the various recharge stations.\n\nThe graphics look very modern and make the 1992 version of Wolfenstein seem pale in comparison. The cutscenes look polished. The levels look picturesque and very realistic, whether they are in Berlin, Germany or London, England.\n\nI think this 2014 entry into the Wolfenstein franchise is breath of fresh air. The narrative is always interesting, although it felt like it took a little too long to carry a weapon, let alone engage in intense combat. This game provides an interesting perspective on what it would be like if the Nazis had controlled the world after World War II. The gameplay is challenging enough that it forces you to think about how to approach dangerous combat situations. The acting performances are convincing, especially from the evil Deathshead to the courageous Caroline Becker, who is an important guide for Mr. Blazkowicz. This FPS is definitely worth playing.\n\nMy Score: 9/10","October 24, 2015","true","60.2"," 139 of 158 people (88%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","88","139","158","10","0"

Hell, up until release I was skeptical. I feared they were going to CoDify my beloved Wolf and BJ Blazkowicz would never again be the baddest Nazi-killin ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this side of the 4th Reich.\n\nBut I was wrong.\n\nAlthough it starts out slow - Wolfenstein: TNO soon turns into one hell of a game. It looks as good as any modern shooter, plays like the mid 2000's shooters like Soldier of Fortune you remember so well, and tells a story so ridiculous yet so deathly serious you can't help but get caught up in it. Not to mention the characters. Hell, it's been weeks since I beat this game and I can still name all the main characters in this story without hardly even thinking about it. They're all so well realized. So well voiced. They're all important. It's a rare thing in shooters these days.  But it all comes back to Blazko:\n\nOne part Lt. Aldo Raine, two parts John McClane and three parts Bear Jew. BJ is back and a better character than he has ever been. Simply put, he IS the baddest Nazi Killin' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you've ever met.

You ain't done yet."\n\nMachinegames did a hell of a job bringing Wolf back for a new generation and as an old school Wolf fan and a champion of old school shooters, I can't say enough about Wolfenstein: TNO. Hell, the best compliment I could give it is that this is the sort of game Raven wishes they could still be making. Equal parts emotional, cinematic, bloody and badass. It's a 2014 FPS ripped right out of 2004's FPS style. You know, back when games like Half Life 2 were what we played, and Call of Duty single player campaigns still meant something.\n\nWhat else can I say? Get it.

A decade ago, the FPS market was littered with World War 2 shooters, including the Wolfenstein franchise's best entry, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and since then the shooter market has migrated away from Nazi culling and has placed it's cross hairs on the insurgents, terrorists and Russians that populate the modern landscape. The ebb and flow of first person shooters has brought us full circle in 2014 with the latest entry to the franchise that gave birth to what has become, arguably, the most popular genre in all of gaming. The New Order mixes the classic, gib infused, lead slinging, Nazi mutilating gameplay that defined the series with modern design elements like stealth and multiple time lines for added replayability. This kind of retro game design is ambitious to say the least, so has MachineGames pulled off a Cirque de Soleil worthy performance or has it fallen and racked it's testes, rendering this classic, macho franchise an impotent eunuch?\n\nPerhaps no other element best exemplifies this clash between modern design and retro sensibilities than The New Order's plot. It's a battleground unto itself where some startlingly realized character relationships find themselves at odds with the sheer absurdity of it's alternate take on history. Three years after the events of the original game, the Nazi's have developed advanced technology that have allowed them to turn the tide of the war. In a massive Allied assault on a weapons laboratory run by General Deathshead, B.J. Blazkowicz suffers a near fatal encounter with the sadistic general, enduring a critical head injury that leaves him in a vegetative state. Like the second coming of Christ, Blazkowicz comes to fourteen years later to find that the  Nazis won the war by being the first to utilize nuclear weapons, and it's up to him to become the messiah of the resistance movement that rages against the Third Reich in a fight that stretches across the globe and even to the moon. It's a narrative that is gloriously kitschy and slightly reminiscent of Iron Sky, though without the clever satire. Counter balancing the B-movie sci-fi narrative are some character interaction s and relationships that are extremely well realized and engaging. Some of the antagonists in The New Order are extremely memorable in ways that so few antagonists have been in recent games. Frau Engel in particular stands out, with her Raiden-esque androgynous male companion and devious, psychotic games. The game's levels are littered with newspaper clippings and audio logs that flesh out this vision of a Nazi ruled world.\n\nWithout a single Tommy Gun or Garand in sight, the gunplay in Wolfenstein's latest entry sets itself apart from the seemingly ceaseless wave of World War 2 based first person shooters that inundated the market pre 2007. Weapons have a very heavy feel to them with high recoil and their propensity to cause Nazi skulls to erupt like melons dropped from a fourth story window. Adding to the carnage are goodies like an underslung rocket launcher for your assault rifle, shotgun rounds that bounce around corners and the ability to dual wield most weapons. The lack of recharging health and collectable armor give the impression that The New Order is an old school run and gun affair but strangely it's not... Stealth is a viable option and generally recommended. Sneaking up on a Nazi and carving him up like a Christmas ham can be just as satisfying as perforating him with an entire magazine. Unfortunately, the stealth also exposes what proves to be The New Order's greatest fault, the enemy AI seems to have suffered from the inbreeding of the master race. Enemies are not terribly perceptive and have little interest in preserving themselves or employing cunning strategies to put an end to your rebellion. Despite the fact that you will find yourself tackling waves of enemies, don't expect to be flanked or flushed out of cover. Wolfenstein does provide some challenge despite the dim witted opposition, unfortunately it's the result of foes that are massive bullet sponges. In the later portion of the game a large number of armored enemies can make progress slow going, and the possibility of running out of ammo is very real.\n\nWhile most of the weapons in The New Order fall into conventional categories for FPS weaponry, there is one unique and welcome addition to the arsenal: the LaserKraftWerk. It's part tool and part Nazi exterminator, allowing B.J. to cut through metal grates exposing, collectables, items and hidden passages. Through the course of the game's 15 hour campaign, the LaserKraftWerk is upgraded allowing it's beams to be reflected, target several enemies, and fire in full auto.\n\nLevels in The New Order are often sprawling and offer multiple paths to an objective. This creates the illusion of occupying a real place instead of a methodically scripted, linear level and also provides numerous opportunities for collectables and easter eggs to be tucked away for those keen on exploring to dig them up. Among these collectables are bits of the Enigma code which gives players a puzzle that, when solved, unlock four additional game modes. Unfortunately silly scripted sequences do interrupt the flow of these levels, it's touch of modern design that The New Order could certainly do without. Variety is commendable and over the course of the lengthy campaign, you will help B.J. fight off Xenomorph inspired robot dogs,  break into prison, hijack a U-Boat and tour Nazi occupied London. In addition, there are two separate timelines that alter some of the game's events providing a small incentive for players to play through the game again.\n\nMachineGame's brings to life a fanciful interpretation of Hitler's neoclassic and art deco laden vision of a world constructed by the Aryan people, though it's largely rendered in an oppressive gray that the fuhrer would surely disapprove of for his ideologically driven utopia. Strands of 1950's futurist design also round out the art direction, bringing to life the most absurd and fantastic elements of the game. Some of the environments can get a bit repetitive since there is little reprieve from the cold muted color pallet and unwelcoming locals but some unique and arresting locations prevent players from becoming too disenchanted with the visuals. Characters look great in stills but their googly doll-like eyes make them look lifeless and disturbing in action but their animations make up for some of this as characters emote in a convincing manner. Thankfully, the voice acting is top notch and more importantly there are German voice overs sparring players from suffering through silly faux German accented English performances or worse, the 1950's American cinema trend of having English actors play Germans.\n\nOut with the old Wolfenstein, and in with The New Order. MachineGames has delivered a strong game that pays homage to the legacy of Wolfenstein while providing some modernizing gameplay elements and, for the most part, they make it work. The abhorrent AI is the strongest detractor that this gloriously absurd first person shooter has but strong level design, visceral weapons and an irreverence for history and realism are a breath of fresh air. While the lack of multiplayer will be a hard blow for fans of Enemy Territory, the robust single player experience complete with unlockables makes The New Order worth the price of admission.  If you can put up with this wild alternate version of history and the bullet sponge Nazis that populate it, The New Order is worth playing. It wobbles and slips on the high wire bridging old and new, threatening to fall, but it makes it across; bravado and manhood in tact.","April 19, 2015","true","17.2"," 141 of 167 people (84%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","84","141","167","14","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/201810/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","I am so anxious to review this game. Ladies and gentlemen, I think I have found a new favorite.\nBeing a testosterone filled man with deep-seated cravings for violence hard-coded into my DNA from my primal, dinosaur hunting ancestors I of course lose my mind when I come across something that's hardcore, violent, action-packed and overall manly. Wolfenstein: The New Order of course, does not let me down.\nStarting off with the basics: Wolfenstein is a revisit of the classic shooter series of the same name, taking on the role of Captain B.J. Blazkowicz you start the game in a desperate final push against the German war machine in 1946 (this is an alternate timeline of our history, so don't be upset if the game isn't historically accurate). Wolfenstein has amazing gunplay, a good story that is much more gripping than I expected, excellent level design and all-around great variety.\nThe gameplay is mostly focused on the shooting, as you can expect from a classic FPS revisit. The firearms have a steady and satisfying punch to them and enemies react appropriately when shot, making for some very nice gameplay. You also have the option to dual-wield most of the weapons in the game, firing two at once by holding down both mouse buttons increasing your overall damage per second but draining your ammo supply faster, but who cares? Manliness brotha. After each shootout the level is noticably affected by it, where most first-person shooters would leave a small handful of bodies and a few splashes of blood on the walls, Wolfenstein has great bullet-impact decals, destructable cover and very nice gore effects, making the area immediately after the slaughter look like it has been completely decimated by the shootout, again, making you feel like an unstoppable bad-@ss.\nHowever, the gameplay is not just restricted to you being an unstoppable killing force. You can also play with a more stealth-minded approach, using a silencer attachment to your pistol, satisfying melee takedowns and even being able to throw your knives for an instant and silent kill. The game is pretty adaptable and while the AI isn't too suited for stealth it still gets the job done well enough. There are four different skill-trees in the game that unlock perks for the player as the game progresses, but unlike most skill-tree based games there isn't some level-up system followed by going into the menu and selecting which perk you want, instead the perks are unlocked based on challenges such as X amount of stealth kills, X amount of pistol kills etc. so the player does not need to concern themselves with carefully selecting perks based on an in-game meta, instead simply play the game the way you like to play it, and everything else will fall into place.\nAnd before I get off the subject of gameplay, I want to make a quick sub-note: The enemies in this game just look badass. I love the Panzerhunds, the giant robot wolves with dagger-pointed teeth, and the frankenstein super-soldiers. Just. Wow, I feel my testosterone levels going berserk just thinking about it.\nLevel design in Wolfenstein is also very well made, with a fine balance between being fluid and controlled when it wants to be and switching to tight and intense when it needs to be. The transition between them is flawless, and each and every level has a unique design to them, making every chapter memorable and avoids being repetitive. In each level also are several hidden secrets, easter-eggs and collectables, creating a very welcome replay value to the game. I do indeed look forward to playing through again.\nNow to the story: I wasn't expecting a huge impact with the story when I bought this game, similar to my expectations with Shadow Warrior. I was anticipating a mindless, shut-off-my-brain bullet and blood shower. But to my pleasant surprise Wolfenstein did in fact create a mighty well done story, not the best I've seen in any regard but surpassed all my expectations. B.J. Blazkowicz was taking part in the final push hoping to end the war in 1946, but events did not go according to plan and he and his team are captured and barely manage to escape, B.J. suffering a severe head injury in the process, putting him into a coma for 14 years. 1960, the war is over and the world is now under the iron-fist of the Third Reich, B.J. is in a vegitative state in a hospital in Poland when he is suddenly awoken by the scent of Nazi blood (MANLINESS). Seeing the world under control of the enemy he dedicated his life to destroy with extreme prejudice, he sets off to find any form of resistance to take the Reich apart piece by piece and take down his rival, a bitter little saurkraut known to most as Deathshead.\nWhile the story did exceed my expectations it also left a few disappointments as well. There were missed opportunities to create some very powerful and emotional moments that the game just slid over, but there are other times where the game doesn't shy away from doing just that. The story is surprisingly good, not exactly the most original of scripts but it was a very interesting idea and it did leave a memorable impact. Now that said, there are some sour-points with the story: Out-of-nowhere plot devices that are never mentioned again in the entire game, just serving no purpose other than to make the story advance. Sometimes the game will try to create some dramatic moments with some characters who are no better than cut-outs: Some examples include obvious love-interest girl, obvious trust-issues guy with a shady past, obvious Jewish guy who does everything to remind you that he's Jewish, obviously Hodor from Game of Thrones, and B.J. himself is for the most part just the heavily-muscled jarhead who always means well but will not let anything get between him and his mission. The ending was also very vague and left way too much unanswered, but there's DLC coming in so maybe that'll change, assuming you're not a cranky anti-DLC activist.\n\nSo to wrap all this up: Wolfenstein: The New Order is a game that met and exceeded all my expectations, it was a great joy to play beginning to end. I highly recommend Wolfenstein: The New Order.","October 19, 2014","true","14.9"," 132 of 161 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","132","161","6","6"

It's that good. It's a game which felt, to me, like the original Unreal, Quake 2, Quake 4 and of course, Return to Castle Wolfenstein. It's solid, polished and when the gun fights are going down it's magnificent, fluid and testing. The boss fights are testing at points too with audio hints and clues if you get a little stuck working out what to do. The main point to make here is the boss fights are well designed with an old school approach in mind. They require some quick reflexes, fast thinking and a little intelligence/perception to work out what to do. I love this, I really do.\n\nThe sound track is like silky smooth milk chocolate to the ears. The music fits the ambience of the levels/scenarios and really gets the adrenaline pumping during gun fights. The sound track changes on the fly depending on how much action is going on at any given time and never seems out of place. It invoked emotion in me. If I made a mistake while taking the stealth option and was forced to bring out the akimbo assault rifles the music adapated fueling my adrenaline and passion for mowing down nazis! MEIN LIEBEN!\n\nThe graphics are sublime, just stunning. The effort that's gone into the detail, polish and art style really fits the game. Nothing seemed out of place and no detail was spared on static props. It runs like a dream on my system:\n\nAMD FX (Piledriver) 8350 (8 Core) 4Ghz\n16gb 1333mhz DDR RAM\nNvidia GTX 670\n\nThe reports of the AI being a bit poor, in my opinion, don't hold any water. The enemies are actively taking cover, rolling/sprinting/sliding behind cover, flanking, making smart use of grenades and forcing you out into the fight.\n\nLuckily, I have also encountered no bugs, no crashes and no funnies. I know this isn't the case for everyone but I can only speak from my own personal experience.\n\nIt took me, around, thirteen hours to complete the game on Death Incarnate, which is quite reasonable considering your average mainstream game these days are clocking in at around six hours.\n\nThe game rewards your play style too. If you want to stealth as much as you can (like me) you can and will be rewarded for it. If you'd prefer to go in all guns blazing (and I'm now going to replay it with the alternate timeline using this method) you will be rewarded for doing so. I like this and I wish more games gave you this option.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough if you're from the generation which grew up with id, Unreal, 3D Realms, Apogee and Monolith. I'm 99.9% sure you're going to love it and even be charmed by the little touches which blend modern technology and techniques with properly good old school mechanics which started the genre.\n\nI give this 10 Llamas of Super Coolness out of 5 Jam Sandwiches.\n\nJust to add, if the developers or any developers like Splash Damage see this review... Please... PLEASE... make an Enemy Territory: Quake Wars on this id tech engine. The world needs more games like Quake Wars.","May 25, 2014","true","12.9"," 78 of 87 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","78","87","0","3"

Blazkowicz is back in Wolfenstien: The New Order, the first title from Swedish Devs - Machine Games.\n\nSet in alternate reality 1960s Europe, Nazi Germany has won the 2nd World War, the Allied nations are in ruins and all resistance has been crushed. Or so it seems.\n\nMixing surrealistic humour with dark themes, WTNO treads a fine line between serious and kitsch. I personally found the story entertaining, even though plot holes abound.\n\nAlong your journey to save the world, you'll be fighting hordes of Nazi stormtroopers and robots (robo-dogs included) in open levels that are pretty unique and well desgined. (don't be put off by the 1st level's linearity, it gets better, trust me.)\n\nGunplay is excellent. Guns sound powerful and bullets have real impact. Enemy a.i. seems decent (played on medium diff)\n\nSound design is great as well, with support for up to 7.1 surround sound. Did I mention that the soundtrack is great? No? Well, it's freakin' awesome :)\n\nGraphics aren't the best even @ high settings due to the crappy id5 engine used. However, in certain areas, the visuals look pretty damn good.\n\nThe story does drag about 3/4 to the end, but I found the ending worth pushing through it. (My 1st playthrough lasted around 15 hours give or take.)\n\nThere is no MP component, which may be a pro/con depending on your personal preference, so bear that in mind.\n\ntldr: Highly recommended, best SP shooter I've played in quite a while.","December 29, 2014","true","33.8"," 73 of 82 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","73","82","2","0"

I expected an average to above average game, but it ended up being my game of the year (so far!). It’s hard to describe how much I enjoyed it but I will try.\n\nStory wise it’s solid. There’s a great cast of characters that you meet throughout the 15 hour campaign. Each has their own story and their own place in the game world. Even the main protagonist BJ, is a much more fleshed out character than his previous depictions in the Wolfenstein games. Also, the cutscenes are incredible. They blended so well into the gameplay and gave me the impression I was watching a film.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this is where Wolfenstein TNO shined the brightest. Every weapon in the extensive arsenal is fun to use, seriously. The weapon sounds, the destruction of the environment and the pure carnage that you can cause is unforgettable. Almost every weapon has alternate firing modes for mixing up the gunplay and making it more than just an average point and click FPS. Dual wielding originally seemed like an unnecessary novelty, but is actually a lot of fun that adds EVEN MORE variety to the way you can play (ex. one assault rifle can shoot rockets while the other fires full auto). Shooting enemies can pop heads, blast off armour, and generally shows a very detailed level of damage. Throughout almost every level there are multiple paths to choose. Because of this, most encounters can be approached with stealth or a more aggressive route.\n\nWolfenstein the New Order is easily in my top five games of all time. That’s not something I expected in this day and age (especially with all the crap I’ve played lately). This game is a big deal for me and I hope that others can appreciate it as much as I did, because it really deserves the limelight.","June 1, 2014","true","28.5"," 70 of 79 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","70","79","0","4"

The gun-play is robust and has a lot of impact; each flavorful weapon comes with two firing modes which gives the player plenty of versatility in combat. There is a laser cannon of sorts in the game which also functions as a wire-cutter that allows you to cut through obstacles and creates new lines of sight and flanking opportunities while in a firefight, it's quite the thing.\n\nThe game features many old-school shooter mechanics but with a modern twist, per-se, you still have your overcharge health and pickups, but your health also partially regenerates, it’s a bizarre concept on paper, but works surprisingly well in action. There are also plenty of collectibles, secrets and news articles to collect around the level, encouraging exploration and provide plenty of replay values for the perfectionist. I personally have no problem with the game shipping without a multiplayer, as it can easily take you 15 hours to complete the two diverging campaigns, and to be frank, I’ll rather see a game that has a great single player experience, than trying to do both and turns out to be mediocre on both front, I personally think 15 hours of quality game-play is reasonable for a tripe A game, but you’ll have to decide that for yourself.\n\nThe stealth system is fairly basic but luckily completely optional, enemies generally have a fairly short detection range and most sections are pretty straight forward, but even if you fail you can always just go in guns blazing and clean house.\n\nThe AI is somewhat inconsistent, however, as enemies will sometimes completely ignore their dead comrades and pretend nothing happened during a stealth section, and constantly running out of cover and staring into the abyss in the middle of the hallway for no apparent reason while in combat.\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order is a solid first person shooter that tries incorporate both the mechanics of old and modern shooters, and succeeded in doing so. The result is a very satisfying arcade action shooter with lots of angry Nazis, explosions and crashes. If you can look pass its ridiculous, but yet somehow compelling story line and a few minor flaws, then Wolfenstein: The New Order is a whole lot of fun, and will most probably leave a smile on your face every time you turn a heavily armored Nazi trooper into a cloud of red mist with a rifle rocket.","January 3","true","15.4"," 80 of 97 people (82%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","82","80","97","10","4"

Albeit edible, any thirsty developer approaches hesitant to the long-gone steam clouds of its hour of freshness. Back before the famed Call of Duty franchise strapped players into the combat boots of the WWII genre, the influential, genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D plotted willing adventurers into the labyrinths of a Nazi prison, with chances of survival as slim as the knife you begin with. Fictictious war hero B.J. Blazkowicz has since become a legendary icon in the realm of interactive media. It's 2014, and MachineGames has not feebly waltzed, but boldly marched back into the dated franchise, armed with a morbid, yet brilliant new concept with Wolfenstein: The New Order.\n\nThe war is over, the Nazis have won, and the future of humanity is bleak, all in exchange for Aryan supremacy. People are dying left and right under the non-chalant smiles of Nazi officers. Rudely awoken after a fourteen-year hiatus in an insane asylum, it's an understatement to say that William Blazcowicz has returned with all the bang for your buck, and then some. It's a setup that drains the hope of the world from even the optimistically devout. Depending on your gameplay preference, you may be hesitant to drop the $60 without multiplayer, but fret not. Even as a single-player exclusive experience, The New Order shines at its pacing and the satisfaction that bleeds from the gratuitous violence on the screen and cakes onto the player.\n\nI didn't initially anticipate myself using the game's new, excessively versatile dual-wielding system, but in no time, I grew used to how surprisingly satisfying it clicked with my input. It drifts away from extreme realism and has you off of the training wheels and behind two assault rifles within minutes of play. It's like Skyrim, with, well...never mind.\n\nAlso new to Wolfenstein is a perk system, which, like its namesake, paves the way for new abilities, or "perks" throughout the riveting campaign. While the small touches in combat are welcome, stealth leaves a lot to be desired. It's satisfying, but I believe a lot more can be done with the mechanic, especially since every stealth-related perk is a trivial achievement that involves actions you may have performed already, thus unlocked or imminently such.\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order will approximately clock you around 10-15 hours, or just under that if you rush. No matter how fast you complete this critter, it will definitely leave you hungry like the Wolf for more.","May 20, 2014","true","12.5"," 404 of 624 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","404","624","0","20"

I suppose because I’d played it briefly on the Xbox One and every time I touch a game on the new consoles I’m underwhelmed by the lack of ‘next-gen’ features and graphics. However, Wolfenstien is a very, very good FPS with a solid story, decent GFX and enforces classic FPS style gameplay. It has a neo-noir style that doesn’t plagiarize the likes of BioShock but does give me a sense that I’ve played and seen something similar before. That said, it holds its own as a unique title and stands firmly above the crowd as a respectable game.\n\nI did not like the fact that the main character is as American as a bacon double cheese burger. Forever are the studios plugging American’s ego when it comes to war, battle and history when story boarding these games. I do enjoy the alternative universe that’s been created and it’s even quite believable for the most part, until the all American hero takes a stabbing from a Nazi only to then immediately recover. Aside from those being the main issues I had with the game, it could have done with some more weapons, a more flattering talent tree, which is unfortunately option less and an inventory system would have gone a long way to earning some extra points from me.\n\nI’m glad I waited for this to go on sale. I’m not saying it’s a bad game, but even though I am going to play through it once or maybe twice more, it’s just not worth the full price. Either wait for it to go 50% off on steam or check ♥♥♥ or GMC for a better deal.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sardonikk/recommended/201810/","Sardonikk","Sardonic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sardonikk/","649 products in account","This is one of the few games that can arguably be said to be worth the $60 asking price.  It's a high price, of course, above the price we PC gamers expect of new games.  However, it must be said that no part of this game is half-♥♥♥♥♥, none of it.  You can see flaws in many great games where they obviously cut corners or ran out of budget, here, everything just works, the shooting, the stealth, the story, the production values, and there is just a feeling of quality that permiates the game.  It feels like a more modern version of HL2, in a way.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics of the game are a wonder to behold.  I played this on an EVGA 760 Superclocked, and I noticed zero framerate studdering, no tearing, just smooth as butter.  People look very striking, the skyboxes are amazing, and pretty much all the textures look and feel excellent, adding to the feeling of immersion.\n\nWeapons\nAll the weapons are pretty great, I won't spoil any of them, but they all feel like they have their useful situations.  They all have real heft and kick to them, and feel suitably powerful.  Weapons upgrades also help to round out the experience.\n\nGameplay\nA welcome surprise is the presence of stealth gameplay in what I thought would be a typical 'shoot mans' game.  Much like in metro last light you can instakill enemies by sneaking up on them.  You also get a silencer for your pistol early on, allowing you to headshot enemies across the map stealthily, which is pretty great.  It feels a little like cheating, but it's still loads of fun to clear an area with only 4 shots and 3 stabbings.\n\nStory/levels\nAnother element that I thought would be lacking is actually perhaps the game's most striking feature.  Each of the game's levels feel nessisary to the plot, nothing feels like filler, there is never any question as to what you are doing to advance the plot, and all your actions feel impactful and rewarding.  to reiterate, NOTHING FEELS LIKE FILLER!  There is also a lot of optional side content, and for the most part it is very high quality.\n\nOverall, I was extremely satisfied with my purchase of this game.  I would recommend it without question to fans of the shooter genre, especially if it was on deal.\n\nWarnings\nThere is lewd sexual content in here as well as some rather cringeworthy torture, though it's a lot breifer and more tastefully done than Burial at Sea 2's disgusting torture scene, that's for sure.  Basically keep the kids away from it, this is an adult game for adults, and elder teenagers I suppose.","May 26, 2014","true","28.5"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","39","46","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glubbable/recommended/201810/","glubbable","Glubbable~ ❥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glubbable/","390 products in account","This is a review based on two playthroughs of the game and is my honest opinion on the game, I personally had a lot of fun with this game, however I feel there's a few things to talk about, so here's my review on Wolfenstein: The New Order.\n\nGameplay wise\nThis game is a massive treat, especially with dual weilding all but two of the weapons in the game, being able to unleash hell upon swarms of nazi soldiers as a one man army. Along with having the ability to either play stealthy, tactical or balls to the walls guns blazing inferno. The only downside is that you cannot shoot while sprinting but you're able to shoot while jumping, even though the jumping feels more like you're skipping along the ground. There's also a hint system that could disable or enable if you wish that'll help you out if you get stuck in certain sections including a seperate hint for loot as well for when you get close enough to them. There's also unlockable perks that in all honesty, don't really change the gameplay up.\n\nGraphics wise\nFor my 3 year old computer, the game looks pretty good on average settings and runs fairly decently except for within a few places, mainly during the first few missions of the game but besides that, the game runs perfectly fine most of the time. In terms of graphics options, majority of the options have been fitted under the same option rather than them being seperate, you are also given the option between fullscreen and window mode and the screen resolution options are filtered to the ones that would best fit your monitor.\n\nStory wise\nThe story is a pretty accurate on how far the Nazi's would've advanced in technology if they achieved world domination, their sole focus on these kind of things would've meant faster acceleration. However, it kinda goes a little crazy when you get half way through the story. Without spoiling it I can easily say that the ending is pretty bad and totally not what I was expecting either, which is a massive disappointment, there's also next to no replayability to this game besides chosing who dies during the intro chapter which changes one character within the hideout and provides different cutscenes & dialog in relation to this character. Oh and there's no dialog difference between the two characters that you had to pick during the intro chapter either, they say the exact same thing in both play throughs most of the time, with only very few differences between the dialog for me. So besides replaying for dialog and cutscenes and upgrading health and armor along with perk unlocking, there's nothing else worth while to make you revisit the game a third time.\n\nDifficulty wise\nNow, there was a leak before the launch of the game that revealed that melee units had extremely poor AI, which is basically true, but you only have to deal with melee units twice within the whole game, both times are prison breaks as well. The only melee unit that was actually fine was the dogs, which of course, just run up to you and attempt to bite you in a QTE.\n\nBesides that, most of the time the AI feels like dumbed down aimbots, that just walk around and shoot at you if they see you, even if its on the otherside of a giant room, losing them however is possible, since they don't know where you are majority of the time if you choose to break line of sight often. However with two boss battles that I encountered, both times fighting giant mecha units, they constantly knew where I was, constantly shot at me even when behind cover and where basically just walking bullet sponges with turrets attachted that would rip you apart if you stayed out in the open. From what I've also noticed, is that the difficulty only changes how much damage you need to deal in order to kill enemies and how much damage they deal to you, which in honesty, doesn't change the difficulty, it just ruins gameplay, slows you down and turns the gameplay into a chore.\n\nThere's also special units that you'll encounter throughout the game, ranging from four varients, one that'll call backup if he spots you or he's alerted of your position. Bullet sponges that come with either a rocket launcher, shotgun or machine gun and robots that are also bullet sponges and will rip you to shreds if you get to close, oh and they'll also instant kill you if you attempt a melee kill. You're also unable to kill rocket launchers and shotgunners with melee as well as they just block your attack or their armor is to thick for your knife. Oh and giant attack dogs that'll only be killed by machine guns or explosives.\n\nAnd as stated before the difficulty only changes the damage you recieve and how much damage the enemies can take, from what I can see the AI behavour between normal and easy isn't different, besides that basic soldiers won't lob nades at you constantly if you hide behind cover. But they'll still act like walking aimbots.\n\nLevel design wise\nMost of the time you're always heading down a set path, in some sections you are granted a little more freedom when approaching areas that involve you plowing down tons of enemies or if you're in some rooms that happen to be crawling with nazi soldiers. As for detail, the game is enriched with it, every environment is unique and different to each other and really capatures the atmosphere.\n\nConclusion\nGameplay is pretty fun, being capable of totally destroying nazies to shreds with any weapon(s) that you obtain and being able to play differently in each section if you wish.\n\nGraphics is pretty good, looks pretty decent on my computer and runs just fine at most times.\n\nStory is ok, but it kinda becomes a massive disappointment with its ending and there isn't much a difference between the sacrifice choice during the intro chapter.\n\nDifficulty is not challenging, becomes repetitive and turns the game into a chore due to the massive excess of bullet sponged enemies that can instant snap to you along with bosses that know where you are, constantly, non-stop.\n\nLevel design is really appealing, each environment is different, doesn't feel repetitive, as for the flow of movement most of the time it feels linear, you're constantly moving in one direction and most alternate paths loop.\n\nOverall\nThis game is great if you just want to have fun while killing Nazi's.\nThis game will run decently on most computers that are around 3 years old now, older than that however you might encounter some difficulties running this game.\nThis game is ok when it comes to its story, but as said, the ending is a disappointment.\nThis game will not challenge you, as the difficulty only changes the damage and some minor AI behaviors like nade lobbing and being able to see you through walls.\nThis game is extremely appealing to the eyes with each environment enriched with detail, so much to look at, so much to read and listen to, it's like candy.","May 21, 2014","true","29.4"," 55 of 74 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","55","74","0","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/201810/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","About as oldschool as it gets, but not really. Wolfenstein has been a longrunning franchise created by iD, first releasing as Wolfenstein in 1992. Although it wasn't the very first FPS, it was the game that pretty much popularized the genre alonside DOOM.\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order may not be one of the most original games ever made, especially by today's standards, but it's a pretty good one. The New Order is pretty much a "What If" scenario where the Nazis won the World War and took over the rest of the world in a sort of farfetched way (it has mechanical dogs). After the intro scenes - the player: Captain BJ Blazkowicz, sits in an Asylum for some odd 14 years, just in time to see how much the earth has changed after the Nazis won the War, and of course, fight back against them to reclaim what was once theirs.\n\nRight off the bat, I noticed the visuals where stunning. Sure, it's most certainly not the best looking game out there, but it looks great from afar and the amazing lighting engine really highlights the game's strongest points. The texture work, however, is very hit and miss. You'll notice some areas have a lot of artifacing or just muddy textures (particularly on repeated ground or wood textures). As mentioned, the lighting engine is really what makes the game stand out from most of the 'last gen' releases.\n\nThe environments are fairly well varied despite the fact that the game takes place in very drab, dark and gray areas. These mostly range from warehouses, to Medical Labs, to Sewers, to Lost, underwater cavers, to even Space. I have to give special mention to the underwater area as it looks really good, it was just too bad that the time spent in that particular scene was too short. The amount of destructibles is also pretty good and actually plays into gameplay a lot, which I really liked!\n\nWolfenstein TNO also has a pretty nice soundtrack to go along with it, although most tracks are forgetable - some of the themes they decide to go with in key areas remind you that you're playing an iD game and not a run of the mill FPS. Guns sound pretty good and have a lot of impact to it, grenades and Tesla grenades thrown by the bigger enemies also have pretty noticeable sound cues that help distinguish when you're in range. I also REALLY liked how the game employs a modulator to help the player tell when an enemy can be lurking close by, going away or coming closer to your area - they sound clear as crystal when they're up close, but will sound fainter and fainter the further they are from you, it helps a lot with the stealth elements in the game.\n\nVoice acting is pretty rock solid as well. Captain Blazkowicz himself has a lot of internal monologues that helps gives insight into what he may be thinking, these aren't always serious though, there's a section where the Captain makes fun of how a specific word sounds and this really helps humanize the character and it makes you care about him beyond him being a soulless jarhead like he was in previous Wolfenstein games (Yes, he's ALWAYS been the protagonist in the older Wolfen games!) . The supporting cast also does a great job, in both their serious moments and wacky banter they may have between each other.\n\nThe gameplay, however... outside some old school mechanics brought back, is pretty standardfare FPS. it ranges mostly from your running down a pretty (admitedly expansive) large corridor while shooting enemies in your way and moving on. The game does try to alleviate the monotony by having collectibles scattered across each stage, like Armor, Gold (collectible, not currency), Weapon upgrades, and some Enigma Codes, which serve as the largest collectible base, giving you even more tidbits of lore, which is always a fun read if you're into that stuff.\n\nThroughout the game, except for the Space level - you get access to pretty much the exact same sets of weapons across the game, these ranging from: Assault Rifle, Pistols, Throwable Knives, Sniper Rifles, Shotguns and the Lazerkraftwerk. I was exceptionally disappointed by the weapon selection in the game, but I was really happy with the way they worked however. That was one thing I REALLY liked about the gunplay, each weapon felt so different to one another that you had very specific usages for them and/or their respective upgrades. Have a ton of enemies attempting to flank you? Opt for the faster weapon, and use your Assault Rifle. Have enemies attempting to gang up on you? Use your shotgun for maximum punishment up close. It's really fun to experiment ways to get out of a firefight by using your own ingenuity to make firefights either harder or easier. Completing certain objectives throughout the game will also unlock perks, additional skills that will help you in combat and will also unlock achievements.\n\nThe stealth aspect also works exceedingly well. As said above, you HAVE to use sound cues to help distinguish when an enemy is far away, coming to you or leaving your area to either kill them, or pass by them - the most recomendable option to be, of course, killing them. You can also throw knives at them for a nice, clean, if not rather noisy kill, you may also use your pistol's silencer upgrade, to snipe enemies from afar. Stealth is not all as easy as it sounds however - if you throw your knife to an enemy that's too close to another, he will hear you, go into alert mode and possibly (if it's a Commander class enemy) call for backup. Same goes if you miss a shot, the enemy will hear the shot, and track it back to you. The stealth system is not without it's faults, however - there are times where an enemy will simply ignore his comrade's corpse and carry on like normal, likewise, some enemies can see you from excessive ranges, while others can't see you at all unless you're standing right in front of them.\n\nThe enemies are also pretty amazingly varied and can be BRUTAL at higher difficulties, resulting in combat that might grind to a halt because the game forces you to play tactically and in this, makes the game feel deeper than it really is at times, especially with resource management. Enemies range from the standard grunts, to huge Mechs that fire easy to evade shots and throw out Tesla Grenades (grenades that CAN home in on your location, but take a while to charge and blow up), to heavies that walk menacingly towards you while shooting at you with his shotgun, to the Super Soldiers, whom are pretty much the Chaingun wielding baddies.\n\nAs far as resource management goes - Your health doesn't heal back to 100% like in many modern shooters, instead it only heals back in multiples on 20 (If you have, for example 68% Health, it will heal only up to 80% or if you have atleast 81, it will heal back up to 100%) and has an "Overcharge" system - which allows your health to go above 100%, but will slowly degrade until it comes back to 100%. You also have Armor. Like in the older games, you can pick up, say, a grunt's helmet for a small amount of armor, that helps deflect back some damage to your overall Health. Armor is scattered across stages, in breakable boxes as well as ammo. In Wolfenstein TNO - you also have the option to dual wield weapons - which will quickly blow through your total ammo. Ammo in the game isn't 100% expendable, you can very quickly run out of ammo if your shots aren't all well placed, and that can lead to serious trouble when battling with the bigger enemies, where the Pistol really isn't a very viable weapon. Grenades are also given to you VERY sparingly across the game, so knowing when to use them is also critical.\n\nAs a whole, I was VERY happy with Wolfenstein: The New Order, albeit at times where the game gets a little monotonous because at the end of it, it's still just another First-Person Shooter that leads you down a linear path with a little on the side to explore. It's got two separate "Timelines" which will feature different dialogue and events depending on whom you save.\n","August 15, 2014","true","14.6"," 44 of 56 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","44","56","0","15"

Wolfenstein (Goddammit, I hope I write the name well throughout the whole review) from 2009 didn't sell THAT well and I honestly have no idea about what happened to make Bethesda own the IP rather than Activision. But since Bethesda isn't all about the money (though it has it's greeds and I very much felt that on my own skin...), they are now going a bit more... old-school-y. First: this, now a new DOOM game is coming and sounds promising and I'm already hyping it alot. And we know the Prey 2 project was scrapped and handed over to the bros at Arkane (Devs of DIshonored, Dark Messiah) to make it a true sequel to the cult-classic original from 2006.\n\nAnyways, knowing The New Order would be a return to old-school shooters, excitement grew. But then the E3 Demo was rather poor: they showed the very first level of the game (which is the most linear and cutscene-ish). It was a poor decision that then didn't stop me from paying full retail price for the Special Edition Retail Box (New DOOM Beta, yay! :D). 50€ for this.\n\nIt was totally worth it...\n\nAlright so! Lets get on with the graphics: iD Tech 5 Engine - I'm AMD so... was I ♥♥♥♥ed alongside other AMD users?\n\nNope! Works perfectly on my PC, it's the 2nd game in history (afaik) that uses the iD Tech 5 technology by Carmack and thus: yes, the infamous Mega-Texture system. Sounds scary, doesn't it? Basically a regular texture game (every other game except iD Tech 5 games (I think all) have everything textured by it's own: a box has its own texture quality, the tree has its own texture-work, characters, guns, fooliage, etc. etc. Everything has its own texture-work. Mega Textures aren't like that: with this system, the whole world around you is made of 1 single texture-work. 1 texture for the environments, boxes, gun-models, characters, fooliage, etc. etc. As you can see, it's a huge texture (thus the name) so one thing you can predict quite easily if you think a bit: Lengthy texture loading! Yes! This will result in texture pop-in, especially worse in the PC version of these games, I will then talk about pop-in in The New Order).\nIt actually shouldn't worry you. Mega-Textures allow the game to look good or very good and also allows players with weaker PC's to run the game well! RAGE was the previous iD Tech 5 game and it was terrible on AMD, I can claim it myself, the pop-in was ridiculous!\nNevertheless, pop-in is pretty much non-existant in Wolfenstein: The New Order (hell! I've been playing Duke Nukem Forever recently again, and the pop-in is worse there!) which is great and unexpected tbh. The game runs really well and looks weird.\n\nWeird because 80% of the game looks good, some parts even excellent. But then others... oh man! Looks 2002...\nNo, I'm serious! I remember a vent whose walls and it's screws were all like paper drawings, no 3D modelling for the screws or the metal bendings. Just looks kinda ugly.\n\nDespite that, overall graphics are pretty good, not great, the game is quite colourful compared to other shooters, which is nice.\nMany people still think how the game is this big. I would bet on the Mega-Textures being the reason, but I'm only assuming. RAGE was the previous Mega-Textured game and it was also really big (Complete Edition is ~24 Gb). Wolfenstein is (don't fall from your chair, please) ~45 Gb. This game is quite heavy on cutscenes so, that should increase the HDD Space count by a lot (games like Alan Wake are like 10 Gb, 6 or 8 Gb of those if I recall correctly were custcene videos!).\nIt will be a pain to download Mega-textured games, but there you go... it's worth it so... enjoy 5 hours of DL time.\n\nAudio is good... for the most part. Guns sound fantastic, voice acting is probably the best this year. However, sound consistency is weak at best. During gameplay, Blazkowicz (the protagonist) will sometimes speak in a super low whisper, which is hard to listen to at times when the rest of the game sounds great and at a normal volume (gun-fire, nazi screams, cuscene voicing, etc.), thank God for subtitles!\n\nThe story, this is the most story focused Wolfenstein game. And it's a very good one at that. I love Alternate History (What If type of stories based on real stuff) and this is probably the best Alt. Hist. Storyline ever.\nNazis are winning the war,  Blazkowicz and other allies organize an attack to a castle (General Deathshead's Lair) to kill the General who is responsible for the huge Nazi upgrade and technology boost. The assault goes south, the Nazi's win and that's all I'm explaining...\nA very good layer of characterization is made to Blazkowicz, making him likeable and interesting. During Hub missions we can talk to many resistance members and also characterization is well done there. There's a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥ing and screaming and raging. But that isn't annoying the player. It's just arguments and frustrations of rational people living in a sadly, irrational environment full of hostility.\nThe ending is very well done, and while some hate it, I found it to be pretty much perfect (and I will not explain why, to avoid spoilers, any curious people just chat with me).\nThe story behind this game is stronger than 90% of movies and videogames and that's a job well done, Machine Games!\n\nThere's no MP. Good, 100% focus on the story and the campaign, which is just excellent! I wish more devs were like this! ♥♥♥♥ing sick of co-op ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on my games. Everything now has to be online, ugh! Disgusting. Co-Op is dead to me. it's never well done and always tacked on. Good online is CoD and Battlefield. Good Co-Op is Killing Floor and Left 4 Dead. The rest is tacked on ♥♥♥♥ (yeah, you too Borderlands!).\n\nCommendable to make an SP only game and have the balls to do it in a AAA title.\n\nMoving on to the gameplay: superb. Guns feel great, the game doesn't take itself too serious (you can eat dog-food to replenish health, you can use car doors and piece of broken robots to replenish your armor).\nIt's just great! In what game can you dual wield Sniper Rifles and go berserk?! What game has a sniper rifle with a secondary fire mode that is an ironsight mode that fires a laser beam! And guess what? You can dual wield that too!\nYou can dual wield knives because "Hey, why not?"...\nA nice layer of depth is added to gameplay with the perk system: if you pull off a certain achievement (kill 3 enemies while dual wielding without releasing the triggers, kill 100 enemies with assault rifles, stealth kill 20 enemies with throwing knives, etc.) you will unlock some nice passive buffs to your character like moving faster while crouching, receiving health or armor during quick consecutive kills, the ability to carry more grenades, more knives, increased magazine ammo count, etc.\nIt's a nice way to make the player do certain stuff and vary the gameplay in order to get those buffs.\n\nEvery gun is fun to use and this is one of the few games that made me replay it though there's absolutely no reason too! Except to get collectibles. Anyways, I can proudly say I've played this game 2 times and I'm almost done with the 3rd playthrough. I still intend in doing the bonus modes so...yeah...\n\nLevel design is overall very good. The first level is linear but once you arrive at the castle, it gets more expansive. You can get to a place usually through 3 or more different paths. I agree it could've been a liiiiittle bit more open, as some places are highly linear but overall the level design excells!\n\nThe game also has MANY Collectibles, 150 if I'm not mistaken. There is nazi gold pieces to collect. Enigma codes (once you unlock a whole set of enigma codes and solve the math equation, you will unlock new game modes, which I won't spoil here, but I must admit, some are REALLY fun and interesting and will allow you to keep yourself busy for quite some time!).\n\n(Word limit is very close, gotta wrap up) 14 hours to beat.\n\n+ 9.5/10, Get it!","July 21, 2014","true","38.8"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","7"

I saved the one on the right, you'll get what that means when you get to that part, as it's a pretty big spoiler and major turning point. The good news is it's in the beginning part of the game.\n\nThis game. Oh my God, this game. I have never felt so engaged, so emotionally invested.\n\nThis game puts you in the deep and dirty. It held no punches, it did not deviate. It gave you the worst ideals of the Nazi regime, the grimiest experiments and most morally-devoid acts, amplified them and spread them about a world to explore. It hits hard. There were times where I felt enraged by the actions of the Nazi soldiers before me, and I wanted nothing but to stick a knife in their neck. At the same time however, each soldier that has dialogue was packed with character. You could see how they were still human, how they momentarily hesitated in their actions or mistakes, but the deep Nazi connections blanketed all that and they continued with their action. There were also Soldiers who were as merciless as their commanders, and killed indiscriminantly.\n\nThis was an experience like no other. The writing is perfect, the graphics are appealing, the music great, and the story is phenominal. The gunplay and the shooting felt amazing. Some parts it felt a little wonky, but you get used to it.\n\nI am very much biased towards this game, but that's mostly because the ending had me in tears. I can't play this for less than four or so hours a playthrough. I highly recommend it, get it when you can.\n\nIn short: Amazing game. 10/10. Emotions for a soldier who could not show emotions. I will play this over and over.\n\n<3","November 27, 2015","true","26.8"," 36 of 47 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","36","47","4","3"

Okay, the protagonist is the right one, we have to deal with a world dominated by the Nazis and the gameplay is heavily biased toward the shootings with a frenetic pace.

The New Order is very different from the Wolfenstein games we've come to know in the past but yet it's sprinkled with some retro surprises to take us back to those times of when the Wolfenstein series first came into existence. Still, there is enough here to seperate The New Order from any of the other Wolfenstein games.\n\nThere's something to be said about the quality of the world that Bethesda has put together when they created Wolfenstein: The New Order. I haven't really seen any game or movie put this much attention to detail in an alternative historical reality - if I'm wrong then feel free to let me know in the comments. There's nothing better than riding in a car only to see a robotic dog being walked by an off duty Nazi officer as you pass by. Small details like this show you how much the developers care about their craft.\n\nWeapons are a huge deal in Wofenstein: The New Order, they feel more than rewarding when you see how your enemies' bodies and the semi-destructable environments react to the power of your guns' bullets. That said, the semi-destructable environments also really add a new sense of strategy and paranoia when you realize that walls, doors and whatever you hide behind might possibly be blown away at any time - depending on the power of your enemy's weapons.\n\nPros Hollywood worthy single-player campaign storyline\nAtmospheric and dark\nFast paced action that never gets dull\nSecrets, secrets and more secrets!\nFull Controller Support\nTop-Notch enemy character designs\nCons  V-Sync issues\nidTech5 Engine doesn't give players the best graphics\nFinal Thoughts:\nThis game takes everything we've come to know FPS games like Call Of Duty and dumps that all too familiar formula on it's head by featuring a lengthy single-player campaign which even includes some story-impacting choices for you to make and in-depth character design. Bethesda put alot of love into creating one of the most atmospheric FPS games to date.\n\nRating (9 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","May 18","true","13.2"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arkveveen/recommended/201810/","Arkveveen","Arkveveen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arkveveen/","437 products in account","I've been a long time Wolfenstein fan. I played Wolfenstein 3D for the first time when I was younger, and it was on one of those ridiculous shareware demo discs alongside the beloved Doom! Ever since, I've kept a close eye on the franchise and enjoyed every iteration, including the recent 2009 game that has sadly vanished without a trace for potential buyers. However, this new entry makes up for that with flying colors!\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order is, without a doubt, one of the most fun shooters of all time and possibly one of the best shooters ever made. Love, passion, and polish have been put into this game, and I have a lot to talk about. But let me try to make this as brief as possible, so you can get the best review possible!\n\nThe gameplay, which is exceptionally fun, allows for a great deal of freedom. Stealth, tactics, or assault. Gameplay can flow between any of these three at any moment. Although the level designs consist of corridors or big open atriums, they still allow for a lot of freedom in how you want to approach a situation. Within these levels, you can find any number of hidden goodies to find, such as collectible gold or special codes that unlock additional game modes. You also will find plenty of useful items hidden in fun locations. Although there is some level of linearity, the game still has alternate paths you can take, even if not all the time.\n\nAs you gun down waves of Nazis using some of the best gunplay I've ever heard or witnessed, the gun toting hero will unlock "perks" which provide passive bonuses in 4 perk trees. Although it isn't as robust or plentiful as, let's say, the perks in Fallout games, it is still a rather welcome modern addition and doesn't detract from the game.\n\nThe game also gives ample reason to replay it, and not just for the collectibles, as their are two alternate "timelines" which bump up the game to 20 hours of playtime! A major two way choice at the beginning of the game will actually CHANGE a few things about the game, including the characters you meet and what major area traversal skill you have. For example, lockpicking or hotwiring.\n\nNow, the final aspects of the game are the story, setting, writing, graphics, sound, and characters. All of it is actually really surprising. The world is full of creative vision, texture, and flavor (the graphics are pretty nice, but rely heavily on effects). White concrete buildings with red Nazi banners proudly flapping in the wind, a group of prisoners being bullied by Nazi scum, and other things help to add to the world. The characters and story is shockingly good too. But before you criticize it, keep in mind that this in context with what kind of crazy game Wolfenstein is. The game has the best story it could possibly have in its current form! The voiceovers are brilliant, the cutscenes are seamless and cinematic. The characters feel very human and world weary, showing the horrors of Nazi rule!\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order is a qaulity shooter. It has some snags, of course, keeping it from its momentum towards success. Graphics problems, people having trouble running the game, mouse sensitivity issues in the menus/journal, and a few minor bugs. The game, also, can be repetitive or too linear as the last half or so of the game loses a bit of momentum, but that is a matter of subjective perspective.\n\nI can safely say, with all of that said, that this is one of the best shooters at least for the year 2014. It's excessively fun, balls to the wall, and very playable. It has soul that so many shooters are lacking lately, and it will fill in that gap in your soul as well if you are a fan of shooters! Get this game, you will not regret it, shooter fans OR Wolfenstein fans!","May 20, 2014","true","42.3"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","32","43","0","2"

Loads of guns, loads of ammo and all to kill hundreds and hundreds of Nazis. You are one man army able to put down whole war machine alone. At least almost alone. Every weapon you can dual wield to make even greater damage to the enemy. I also like the possibilities of some weapons, for example using buckshots or shrapnel shots with the shotgun etc. I won't go much into the details, you should see this for yourself. You can also beat the whole variety of enemies from nazi dogs to panzerhunds.\nThere is nothing I would criticize in this aspect of the game.\n\n+ Perks and Collectibles\nThe perks give you a challenge during the gameplay. If you want to achieve them all, you will try every possible playstyle there is, and try all of the weapons. Afterwards you will be rewarded with major or minor improvements to your abilities. The collectibles offer you something to hunt and the reason why to look in every corner of the map. In The New Order collectibles are not so easy to find, but if you find them all, you can experience how it feels satisfying to beat the game on 100 %.\n\n+ Graphics\nExcept that the game is full of grey buildings, roads etc. where you won't admire neither scenery nor design, graphics as a whole is amazing and effects of the moments like when you cut a throat of a nazi commander are incredibly perfect.\n\nØ Sneaking\nIf you are tired of Rambo style going through the game you can sneak and take Nazis one by one with knife takedowns, throwing knives or using silencer on your pistol. Don't get me wrong, it's fun, but being able to kill armored soldier by hitting him in the leg with a thrown knife is at least a little strange. Another thing is that nazi fellows many times completely ignore their fallen brethren, step over them and continue their patrol like nothing has happened. Still it's the part of the game I enjoyed the most, reminded me of the predator mode in Arkham series.\n\n- Story and Directness\nAnd finally the story. The idea is great. It's the 1960, twisted history, reality where Nazis had won WW2 by having noticeable technological lead far ahead from the rest of the world. What could go wrong here? Only that the story is really awfully disapponting, simple and very predictable. Captain William "B.J." Blazkowicz, a war hero American, not Polish! going after his nemesis nazi sciencist Wilhelm Strasse. I won't spoil much, but from the beginning it looks like it could be a while after the war, but as the game develops you get into more and more sci-fy world, it looks like in the middle the developers didn't know how to continue so they put in it more and more shooting parts. Some minor holes are filled with the already mentioned collectibles and newspaper articles which are found frequently on many places in the game. And the choices? Only once during the whole gameplay, only once you got a choice which matters. After that, it's filled with directness, every level has only one way out, one option how to finish.\n\n7.5 / 10\n\nEven though, as I said, it's one of the best shooters released in a long time, I rate also other features and my personal  overall rating of the game reflects it.","February 1","true","16.1"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","1"

I mean B.J Blazkowicz.\n\nWolfenstein the New Order is the reboot of the long standing franchise as envisioned by Machine Games. Wolfenstein is credited as being the first ever stealth game with Castle Wolfenstein from 1981, and it's sequel, Beyond Castle Wolfenstein from 1984. The most famous game, and the one veteran FPS players remember the most is Wolfenstein 3D by ID Software, a title that was a revolution at the time, and ID's first venture into the FPS world, even before the almighty Doom. Wolfenstein was a pioneer in 3D gaming for PC's back in the day, and The New Order respects it's heritage by taking the franchise to a whole new direction.\n\nThis is the first Wolfenstein game that has a story, a well thought, engaging, thought provoking story. The plot allows for character development, and this is the first FPS that actually made me care about what happens not only to the protagonist B.J, but also with everyone he interacts with in the fight to cripple the Nazi oppression, and B.J's main antagonist, General Deathshead.\n\nThe story takes place in an alternate timeline where the nazis have won World War II. It starts in 1946, but the majority of the game takes place in 1960, 14 years after B.J goes through a traumatic experience.  This is all that I am going to say when it comes to the game's story, because it truly deserves to be experienced spoiler free.\n\nWolfenstein is a tribute to the FPS's of the 90's, but mixed up with some modern mechanics. The end result is very satisfying,  and feels both modern and retro, and in my opinion the way Machine Games pulled it off, deserves praise all on it's own.\n\nGameplay is over the top, violent and incredibly fun. You can dual wield every single weapon in the game, knifes, shotguns, machine guns and even sniper rifles. Yes, you read that right, you can dual wield sniper rifles. I can't think of any other game that allows that. The shooting mechanics are easy to master, and the over the top violence suits the game theme well. This is a Mature rated game for a reason, there is an abundance of blood, guts and nazi brains.\n\nThe game mixes traditional shooting with stealth, rewarding both styles equally. It is up to you how you want to play the game, and you will discover that some levels are better done in a particular way. It has a perk system that allows you to unlock more abilities by performing in game actions, and these are separated into 4 different types, Stealth, Tactical, Assault and Demolition. It adds a layer of strategy that is welcome in this style of game, as far as I am concerned.\n\nWolfenstein The New Order uses the ID Tech5 engine, which is both a good and a bad thing, depending on who you ask. If you have a capable enough PC, you will be blown away by the detail and visual effects, particle system and the textures. This game looks amazing at 1080p with all the details on Ultra. If you have a mid range PC, you may experience texture popup, which breaks the immersion in my opinion, and poor frame rate, so be sure your machine can handle this game before you decide to buy it, it can be very resource intensive.\n\nThe music is phenomenal, and gets your adrenaline pumping when the action gets hectic. The stealth takedowns are brutal, and are not for the faint of heart. The campaign is long, and very satisfying. This is triple AAA at it's finest, and a game that deserves every penny, in my personal opinion. It also has 2 different timelines that alter some details of the main campaign, based on a decision B.J has to make early in the game, and even though it can be seen as a gimmick, it adds replayability.\n\nWolfenstein The New Order is one of the best shooters I have ever played, the story, mechanics, graphics, and sound offer a complete package for both veterans and newcomers. Don't miss out on this title, shooting nazis doesn't get any better than this. Kudos to Machine Games, their vision of Wolfenstein made B.J a force to be reckoned with amongst FPS heroes.\n\nThe Good\n\n-Graphics and sound\n-Story\n-Thought provoking\n-Shooting mechanics\n-Long and varied campaign\n-Dual wielding guns adds an insane amount of fun to the game\n-Shoot nazis on the Moon, on a U-Boat, In London, kill mechanical dogs, and a whole army of high tech/retro enemies\n-Sex scenes are both ridiculously funny and out of place, and emotionally enganging at the same time\n\nThe Bad\n\n-Single player only, Not a problem for me, but worth pointing out\n\n9.5/10","February 10, 2015","true","42.0"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","19","22","9","1"

This could not be more true. Wolfenstein: The New Order is one of the best FPS I have played in a long, long time ranking up there with Bioshock Infinite and Singularity.\n\nThe game excels in all areas: gameplay, narrative, sound design, graphics, atmosphere, you name it. What immediately struck me while playing was the physicality of the guns. When firing a shotgun at a Nazi's head it feels oh-so satisfying. The guns have weight to them and feel tremendous. The story, however, is far better than I think anyone thought it would be. The alternate history is not just filler for the gameplay as I was fascinated by the alternate take on WWII and the events that unfolded. The cinematics are presented beautifully and the voice work is fantastic.\n\nIn short, Wolfenstein: The New Order is a MUST BUY for any and all FPS fans.","July 27, 2014","true","14.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","4"

Personally i would switch all the time, some parts I'd sneak around and try to find hidden areas that will help me get by unnoticed but other times i just wanna let go and kill every Nazi scumbag with my trusty shotgun.\nThe health system is very old school, you have 100HP, you can overheal yourself above the maximum HP for a short time and you pick up armor around the map to take less damage however there is a lil bit of HP regeneration but not much, you will always regenerate about 10 to 20HP, so if you drop to let's say to 5HP after a fight it will slowly go up to 20 so you at least can take a bullet or two if you bump into someone and have not managed to find a health pack, i think it's a very nice combo of old and new.\n\nIt's well worth the money during an okay sale, imo it's worth picking up even for 25 or 30 Euros but full price (50 Euros) is imo a bit to much for an 8 hour (or so) Single Player campaign, yes it's worth replaying a second time but still theres other games which would offer more hours of entertainment for less money or the same amount.\n\nSo yeah, pick it up even during a small discount sale , it's totally worth it.","October 6, 2014","true","16.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","1"

After a long sprint of mediocre games, Wolfenstein triumphantly returns with an excellent story-driven arcade FPS. It tends to feel a lot like playing a Bioshock game, which isn't a bad thing. With its' divergent storyline, Wolfenstein has managed to capture my attention. Fans of would-be history games will love this.\n\nStory\nIt is the 1960s and the Nazis have controlled the world for quite some time now. B.J. Blazkowicz, the protagonist of the series, awakes after a head injury to find that the United States no longer exists and is determined to find a resistance. Once he does, the Resistance, led by a charasmatic woman named Caroline Becker, embarks on a quest to take down the Nazi empire from the inside.\n\nPros:\n- An incredible storyline set in a 1960s Nazi ruled world.\n- Aestheticaly pleasing :]\n- Mixed loud and stealth play\n- Great divergent-style weapons; Weapons that could have been.\n- Great mix of enemy personel.\n\nCons:\n- A break from the traditonal Wolfenstein games (Which isn't such a bad thing)\n- Protagonist's voice acting can be a bit annoying (constantly whipsering soliloquies in a Christian Bale Batman way)\n\nVerdict?\n7.5/10 - Wolfenstein: The New Order is a very fun game. When it comes down to the wire though, it is still simply another arcade FPS along the lines of Bioshock, Serious Sams, etc. The saving grace of this game is the great story. The action is also quite fun. The weaponary you will use in The New Order are divergent designs of real weaponry from the WW2 period. Overall, I enjoy playing this game and the replay value is on the higher side of the scale. If you love killing Nazis, WWII history, or even just Wolfenstein in general, I recommend!","February 20, 2015","true","27.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","5"

It'll take you to some unexpected places.\nStrong narrative. I don't understand how they pulled this off; they took the most campy and tacky concept there was (Science-fiction nazis rules the world! Woo!) and took it really seriously and it paid off. I felt satisfied by the story.\nSolid shooting. It's nothing new or too spectacular but the shooting works and it does it's job just fine. There is some elements of optional stealth which I enjoyed.\nThe worldbuilding is very strong. There are journals, news clippings and even pop songs to flesh out the universe nicely.\nWhile the pace wasn't perfect I do feel that the campaign was long enough with dragging on too much.Neutral:\nThe game is very linear.\nThe graphics looks okay. With the exception of some textures the game looks fine.\nThe enemy AI is very stupid when it comes to stealth, almost offensively so. You can shoot a guy in the head in front of his ally and he won't react at all. They won't react to bodies, etc. I put this as a neutral thing because it makes stealth a bit easier if you want to play stealthly but aren't too good at it. If you were expecting stealth mechanics and AI like Thief you can put this as a negative.\nThe boss encounters were okay. Nothing too interesting but not awful either. They work, but are not very memorable.\nThere are collectibles in the game but they aren't too exciting, but if you like exploring and collecting you may enjoy it.Cons:\nLack of guns. The guns that are here have alternate fire modes, but at the end of the game I was tired of using the same old ones all the time. Some guns also lack a sense of "punch" - the shotguns felt very weak to me, not like how a proper boomstick should.\nLack of enemy variety. You'll be seeing a lot of the same old nazis with the same old guns. Not going to spoil all the enemies, but there's not too many kinds of them here.\nSome textures looked downright awful, even with the game maxed out.\nThere are some fetchquests and firefights which felt like padding. It didn't ruin the pace of the game completely but there were a few places where I went "Oh come, just let me advance already!"\nNo skintight leatherclad Nazi babes. This was hugely disappointing on many levels.\nThe story took me 18 hours to complete and overall I'd rate the game 7,5/10. I was pleasantly surprised by the narrative but not entirely blown away by the action. That said, I did enjoy my time with the game.","May 6","true","19.0"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Wolfenstein takes these inspirations and creates something with its own identity that leaves you wanting more.\n\nI've played the game on Uber difficulity, which has taken me about 12 hours to complete. I took my time with a more stealth based approach, but did enjoy a few engagements going full-on guns blazing. Both ways of approaching a situation are carefully crafted making the AI seem very smart than in most games I've played, resulting in some very entertaining combat.\n\nStory wise, the game presents some morally conflicted decisions, sometimes even in very tense situations. MachineGames have done an amazing job at never making you feel like you're being held by the hand of the game designers to do what they want you to do. I've watched walkthrough videos and saw things I didn't expierence, or vice versa. This approach makes your expierence unique when talking with your friends about their expierence encouraging you to go back to play again seeing what else there is.\n\nAnother thing that stood out to me was they way they did Quick Time Events (QTEs), or more specifically, how they didn't do them. There are a lot of moments with up close in-your-face gameplay, and you don't get a button prompt on the screen which breaks your believeability of this world you're in. You instinctively start pressing buttons / moving your mouse and you're doing what you thought you'd be doing. They introduce this mechanic in a great (and frantic) way early on in the first level, and continue to effectively implement it in various scenarios that make you feel like "Yeah, I did that on my own".","June 3, 2014","true","13.1"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","2"

The game can be played somewhat stealthy with there being some back rooms and places where you can sneak up on badguys,  a silenced pistol and throwing kinves - but you'll be most happy dual-wielding assault rifles or shotguns and blasting your way through rooms like an action hero.\n\nI played on uber difficulty, so there were some rooms that I had to repeat once in a while because the baddies become pretty heavily armoured toward the last third of the game, but I was never stuck long enough to get frustrated. If I had to knock the game for anything, it would be the checkpoint saves (though I never had to replay too much action upon death).\n\nThe story unfolds both in cutscenes and by reading newspaper clippings and talking to characters at the base (between story sections). These parts can be slow, but they break up the action so you're not constantly fatigued.\n\nHonestly, this has to be one of my favourite shooters to date, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes singleplayer action games. Don't let the fact it's a remake fool you, it's well done and a good tribute to past games that shared the Wolfenstein name.","November 22, 2014","true","13.3"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","2"

They tried saying the same thing with the previous Wolfenstein remake, you know, the one with the god-awful open-world gimmick that made traveling from mission to mission feel like torture.\n\nSurprisingly, The New Order delivers on the old-school feel; it's a very fast-paced game that works better as a run and gun than a cover-shooter. Guns feel unique, varied, and powerful, with interesting secondary firing mechanics that unlock as you play, so you never really find yourself getting bored with the guns you've been using since the opening sequence. Rechargeable health is non-existant, finding hidden caches throughout the map feels both necessary and fun. I've found that the idea that you should reward the players for exploring the nooks and crannies of your map to be a somewhat dated idea in the eyes of the modern developer, so it felt really refreshing to think "I'll bet there's a health upgrade somewhere at the end of that seemingly pointless hallway" and actually being right. Yes, there are a few modern-gaming gimmicks thrown in that feel pretty annoying (don't expect to be free from QTE's) but these moments are infrequent enough that it didn't ruin my experience or make me feel like Machine Games thought I was an idiot. Boss battles are challenging, fun, and unique, and usually involve giant mechs, it's great!\n\nThe game never takes itself more seriously than you do: it's cheesy, over the top, ridiculous, and self-aware. The cutscenes are over-dramatic in the best way and BJ gives an entertaining, brooding, almost Max Payne-esque narration of what's happening. I loved it. Think 80's Action B-movies. Dialogue aside, the story also presents itself through collectibles and through the environment itself in the form of recordings, newspaper clippings, etc. that fill you in on the details of how the Nazi's won World War II and successfully took over the world. If you're into alt-history, you'll really appreciate all the detail in the background and the expansive reading material written in order to make this retelling of history feel natural and semi-plausible.","November 25, 2015","true","16.7"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","23","31","2","0"

The setting of this game is awesome. You're B.J. Blazkowicz, running through all kinds of environments in an alternate 1960s, killing Nazi's the second you see them. The difficulty and gameplay of the game is pretty balanced. The dual-wielding gun mechanic actually works pretty well, for example, launching grenades with one gun and shooting with the other. You can even shoot with two sniper rifles simultaneously if you want. Melee attacks work fluently and effective. There's no real cover system; this is picking up huge guns armor and bullets, storming through the level whilst blowing up huge Nazi robots and metal robot dogs.\n\nThe visuals look really well, everything is very detailed and you have your typical corridor FPS level designs. The surroundings are so highly detailed and well-made so that it's worth exploring, which can even result in finding some collectables for those interested. The guns look awesome, the flashy effects look great, and the sound effects and voices are top-notch. The characters are interesting and B.J. Blazkowicz narrating certain things was a welcome thing, too. Without spoiling too much, there are two different 'storylines' which add a bit of replayability to the game.\n\nWhile Wolfenstein: The New Order didn't really come up with anything 'new', except for maybe the ability to dual-wield guns this way (which I've never experienced before personally), it did breathe new life into the Wolfenstein franchise. Unfortunately it still is a pretty generic sci-fi shooter and the story may be kind of forgettable, but Machine Games did a very good job on creating a very unique, good looking and well playing game. The story keeps you entertained and hooked throughout the whole game and there's never a dull moment. I can safely say that this is one of the best storyline-driven FPS-games of all time.\n\nThis game has a genuinely good single-player campaign, with a story that's action packed and brutal. The gameplay is very balanced and smooth. Everything looks gorgeous and detailed, supported by a tensing soundtrack and story. One of the best FPS-games from this era, highly recommended.","January 10, 2015","true","11.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","2"

You shoot them with pistol, assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle as well as their future version. You can dual wield too!\n\nThe game is a nice mix of oldschool gameplay and modern approach to shooters (pretty unique health system). It offers two timelines (it depends on choice early in the game) - there isn't a big difference between two, but sometimes levels play a bit different. Dialogues slightly change, but the story is the same. Voice acting is excellent and the main hero (voiced by Brian Bloom - Kane in Kane and Lynch games and Jackie in Darkness II) is a perfect match. Other characters are doing very well at least. Story is good, not outstanding but solid. Maps are long, but since it is a linear shooter it doesn't hurt. They allow freedom to a degree. What surprised me - this game has a simple but very satysfying stealth system. Stealthing was very enjoyable and I devoted a full playthrough to it.\n\nGuns are great. They sound absolutely massive (assault rifles in particular). Their models and animations are excellent. Enemy variety isn't big, but every character is detailed and has great animations. They sound very well too.\n\nCollectibles - YES! It wouldn't be a proper Wolf game without those. They are nicely hidden and there is sort of meta game related to them and Nazi Commanders. You have to find out yourself, but this is a really nice idea and I loved it.\n\nGraphics - great. Graphical style - outstanding and certain vistas are stunning - not that they are beautiful, but impressive. Music is great - a mix of metal and industrial - excellent match to atmosphere. Performance is good.\n\nPC version has FOV slider as well as toggle option for crouching, running and iron sights. Everything else that should be in PC game is present. Very good port.\n\nBy now you should have an impression that new Wolf is a good game. It isn't. It's excellent in every department. If you like eliminating Nazis then it's a game for you. A worthy RTCW and Wolfenstein (from 2009) successor.

The campaign tells a fantastic story, one of the best I have ever played, where you feel as if you get to know the characters in a mutual way. The gripping story is fantastic with many different items to collect and is all good, but once you have finished the campaign, that's it you have finished. There is nothing else to do when you complete the campaign and is most certainly not worth £34.99 (approx $59.99) due to there being nothing else to do once the campaign is complete.\n\nIn some missions, the game gives you the choice of either going in guns blazing or playing stealthily which both have their pros and cons depending on how you want to do it. This gives the player some freedom and I personally find this very good as you choose how you want to play the game. The gunplay is also responsive and fluid but I found that the gun models were a bit big and took up most of the space on the screen, but I wouldn't let this put you off.\n\nI was running this game with these specs:\n\nAMD FX-4300 @ 3.8GHz\n8GB RAM\nAMD R7 250 DDR3 2GB OC\n\nThe frame rate was relatively stable with only some lag on huge explosions, but the frame rate is stable 99% of the time. However, whilst I was playing the game in some missions I found that it took a little while to render some textures when I moved the camera and this was frequent throughout the game and bugged the hell out of me!\n\nIn conclusion, I think that anyone who loves fighting Nazis and who loves First Person Shooters with a gripping and compelling storyline will adore Wolfenstein: The New Order. I think that Wolfenstein: The New Order deserves an 8/10 as the storyline is one of the best that I have played, however once the campaign is complete, you won't touch this game for a long time. However, I would wait until the next Steam sale as this game is definately not worth £34.99 ($59.99) for the short hours of gameplay that it has.\n","October 30, 2014","true","14.2"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","18","23","2","0"

It has a nice science fiction story about what would've happened if Germany won WWII after all. It starts off semi realistic but the action and settings become more over the top halfway through the story. The shooting aspect feels very solid and dual wielding guns is a nice touch, even if it isn't all that accurate and becomes less helpful later on in the game when tougher and more enemies appear.\n\nThe stealth aspect was, for me personally, the best part of the game. Enemies are sometimes stupid and they won't even spot you when you're practically hugging them and other times they see you when they're not even supposed to but knifing enemies (and especially throwing knives) just feels awesome and satisfying. I was actually disappointed every time I was (incorrectly) spotted.\nLevels are also less linear than the previous Wolfenstein games so you can sometimes take a different road. These seperate roads aren't long but they give a nice illusion of freedom. An illusion the Wolfenstein games absolutely need to keep it more fun.\n\nThe perk system is also a nice addition and a bit different than what you're used to. Perks can be unlocked only in a certain order and it's entirely up to you what you want to do first. Do you want to unlock the stealth perks first, or the more explosive perks ? It gives you freedom in how you want to play the game, which is refreshing. Even if the backbone of this system is still the same as in any other game using perks.\n\nThe voice acting is excellent, and the soundtrack kicks in nicely when a shootout is about to begin. Nothing to complain about here. The graphics on the other hand don't feel very next(/current)-gen, but are still good (especially the characters), and texture streaming is still a problem with this engine and this impacts the overall experience. Performance in general seems to be terrible, even with the most high-end systems. But you can still get it to run at a solid 60FPS with a little tweaking here and there.\n\nWolfenstein The New Order took me 10 hours to complete, which is pretty long for a shooter these days. And if you read the entire review you don't have to ask me why I would recommend this game to anyone. It has my seal of approval. *Stamp*\n\n[Rating: 86/100]","May 25, 2014","true","10.8"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bordje/recommended/201810/","bordje","Bordje |-/","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bordje/","350 products in account","TLDR VERDICTWolfenstein: The New Order is a pleasantly surprising mix of well designed, amazingly fun FPS mechanics with complexly written, emotionally invested storytelling. Don't judge this book by its cover as what appears to be another Nazi slaying shooter is in fact one of the most memorable and powerful gaming experiences I've ever had. This is definitely worth a look on sale, even if you're not ordinarily a shooter guy/gal.\n\nFULL REVIEW BELOW\n"While I was gone, they set the world on fire. It wasn't a war anymore; it was a remaking. Some losses are inevitable. Some... unthinkable. Now they've built a new world. Armies of steel and thunder. They're rewriting history. But they forgot about me." - William BJ Blazkowicz\n\nFollowing a near-fatal head wound during a crucial mission that would determine the outcome of World War II, Captain William BJ Blazkowicz has been in a comatose state for 14 years. He wakes up. The year is 1960. The war is over. The Nazis won. The New Order rules all over the world.\n\nThis review is written from the perspective of a fan of action shooters and story driven games, but no experience with previous Wolfenstein games.\n\nGAMEPLAY AND DESIGNFirst and foremost, the New Order does a great job with its shooting mechanics. At first, a lot of the guns may feel a bit typical (pistol, assault rifle, SMG) but they game really gets its progression right and you unlock more and more weapons and upgrades all with their own quirks and gimmicks. The game doesn't bury itself in the details of how it's possible that you can dual wield shotguns and assault rifles or how your able to carry pretty much every weapon at once. The gunplay is pretty satisfying, especially when you land that awesome brain-spraying headshot or you fire enough shrapnel shards into a dude to turn him into Swiss cheese. That's not an exaggeration either, this game spares no detail when it comes to gore and violence. One moment that struck me early was throwing a grenade into a bunker and then wading through all the chunks of Nazi afterwards. Exposed ribs and everything, nasty stuff. You can also do an action slide and the lean and cover mechanics work really well too.\n\nThe gameplay and level design is much more open ended than your average shooter. You are fairly often, given the option to sneak around with a suppressed pistol and a few knives (which can be thrown or used for some gnarly and well animated stealth takedowns). The key thing to remember here is the fact that it is an option. Regardless of whether you sneak through the hidden vent with a knife or kick down the front door with a shotgun in each hand, there is no real right answer. This game isn't like Dishonored or Deus Ex however, and you cannot play the entire game like this, but the option is there frequently enough to satisfy a first person stealth action fan such as myself. The game also rewards your chosen playstyle with a well-designed perk system similar to Elder Scrolls, but far more substantial. You won't find any generic "movement speed increased by 3%" or "headshot damage increased by 5%" here. Every perk is something meaningful, noticeable and based on the playstyle it’s tied to. The 4 key areas you can get perks for are:\n\nStealth: This involves avoiding detection, getting stealth kills, silently scooping up pickups like health etc. The rewards make it easier to do these things like moving quieter, carry more knives, noise travels less far.\nTactical: This involves getting headshots, using cover and accurate small arms weapons. The rewards include faster reload, magazine size and increased health regen.\nAssault: This involves dual wielding and using heavy/laser weapons. The rewards include more movement speed and armour gain.\nDemolition: This involves the use of grenades and other explosive weapons. The rewards include more explosive capacity and increased effectiveness of explosives.\n\nThe good thing about these perk paths is that they all remain open for the entire game, allowing you switch your playstyle on the fly to whatever you feel like. Another advantage of the open levels is the ability to explore for collectibles and side paths/objectives. Whilst this game does go a quite a bit overboard with the collectibles (132 total) they can be worth getting depending on how you feel about the narrative and cosmetic rewards. However, the key overarching theme that this game has giving the player the choice of how they want to experience it. If you’re playing it as a linear corridor shooting gallery you can do that and be done in 8 hours or you can take your time to sneak around and explore the world and be done in 12+ hours.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the AI is no pushover, at least on normal and up difficulties. They will take cover and try to flush you out of yours with explosives or flanking as much as they can. Your health regenerates, but only to a certain point. If you want to stay alive you need to be very aware of the health, armor and ammo pickups laying around.\n\nSTORY AND NARRATIVEFor someone going in expecting a mindless Nazi slaying simulator I was supremely surprised by this games narrative. The story is excellent and the voice acting performances are top notch. All the characters are very well fleshed out and varied and it all feels very original and unique compared to other shooters out there today. It's a new twist on the classic World War II shooter. I went into this game having never played a Wolfenstein title before and I came away incredibly impressed. There are some really harrowing and tense moments in this game that made heart sink into my stomach or try to beat out of my chest. Even the villains are given more background beyond the fact that they are Nazis and that's why we should hate them. The soundtrack is great and always fits whatever happens to be going on perfectly whether it's pumping me up or freaking me out. There are even two branching storylines that make a few changes to the game both story and gameplay wise if you’re after some replay value. There are however a few moments in the game that are bit confusing in the sense of the tone and emotion the writers are going for in certain contexts, however this is a minor blip in an otherwise amazing narrative.\n\nOne thing that this game did really well, not just for a shooter, but for videogames in general is the romance plot. It felt very believable and tasteful and to be honest it's probably the best romance plot I've ever seen done in a video game. Story wise, The New Order blew my expectations out the water and then some.\n\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCEThe New Order definitely relies more on its art style over actual visual fidelity. It's not as "cartoony" as something like Dishonored but isn't exactly photorealistic either. It holds a middle ground that looks pretty good, but it isn't exactly anything to marvel at. A lot of the basic wall and ground textures aren't too hot. The gore and lasers are probably best looking aspects of the game.\n\nThe developers managed to get this game working at 1080p 60fps on the current gen consoles so pretty much all modern PCs shouldn't have any issue running this game with similar results. Do be aware that it doesn't run any higher than 60fps. It ran perfectly for me (i5 4670k, GTX 970, 8GB RAM) and for many people I know with a range of different systems.","March 24, 2015","true","11.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

Take this game as an equivalent to Expendables movies. If Expendables showed up 15 years ago, everyone would be annoyed and bored in a way like "jeez, not these crusty clowns again, please!". But nowadays, when everything must be shot with shaken camera, every plot has to have at least 3 twists and main antagonist is pictured as internaly disrupted guy who deserves our sympathies, it has just hit the audience with the force of 10 has-been bad-asses. And so did the Wolfenstein.\n\nThis game is pure linear corridor one with a couple of tiny options to finish the task - there are always 2 or 3 ways at the maximum how to reach the checkpoint, and so it is with the playstyle: you can be Sam Fisher, the Terminator, or both. Nothing more, nothing less. But it is great and entertaining.\n\nThe plot is suprisingly very dark and serious. I don't know why I expected the plot will be ironic, over-the-top humorous story about stupid and impotent Nazis against Duke Nukem style bad-♥♥♥. I assume it could be because of Iron Sky movie from which Wolfenstein borrowed some ideas for sure. Speaking of which, this game is full of pop-cultural references to movies like Robocop, Inglorious Basterds etc. for example, but anyway, the plot is neat, the atmosphere is brilliant and the ending is satisfying. And did I mention that B.J. is a fricking bad-♥♥♥?\n\nNow the negatives.\nUnfortunately, this game is not polished. It suffers from time-to-time crashes, microstuttering is almost everywhere (especially in interiors) and AI is poor and sometimes suffers from bad pathfinding. There is also weird checkpoint system - sometimes, when you die, you are spawned behind the spot you died so you do not have to face those enemies who killed you before.\nCrashes and microstuttering will be fixed in time for sure with patches and new gpu drivers, but I am quite sure AI and checkpoint system will stay as it is now, which is sad.\n\nBut hell, this game kicks ♥♥♥ anyway! I am looking forward for the sequel.\nWell done, Machine Games!\n\n8.5/10\n(1 point down for technical issues, 0.5 point down for lack of Nazi Dinosaurs)","May 24, 2014","true","27.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","The New Order is a game attempting to walk in various directions at once. It's also a title attempting to maintain old conventions of particular shooters whilst adopting modern expectations of what constitutes an FPS experience.\n\nOn the one hand, you can dual-wield shotguns and speed-run a level. On the other, you can forego the craziness and take a safer, more cerebral approach to the killings, with single fire options available on your automatic rifles and the option to lean in and out of cover. Then there's the ability to stealth your way through the entire level, with suppressed handguns and silent take-downs with knives.\n\nYou can generally play to whichever of the three conventions you wish to adhere to, but the first is somewhat of an illusion. This is one of my few critiques on the game: The New Order gives you the option to Serious Sam your way through a level, but it feels rather tacked on and counter-intuitive when you can steadily die if you decide to run through the whole ordeal. Sure, you can Rambo your way through a level, but in-between spurts of action you'll need to take cover and let the health-regen kick in. You'll also need a substantial amount of armor gathered to be able to take enough damage to do any sort of dent in the enemies defenses while you're running all over the map. Armor that needs to be collected by foregoing the action, which, from a design perspective, ensures that the player is at least encouraged to try a stealithier approach and play the game in more than one way. Not that this encouragement is necessary as the game has plenty of sections that require you to stealth your way through a map, due to the absence of weapons other than knives.The game is ultimately meant to be a light cover based shooter with stealth elements, consider the 'Rambo' option more as an option that comes with conditions.\n\nThat critique aside, there's not much more to pick at. The stealth and gunning elements work well in-tandem, and the maps are created in such a way to allow either option to be viable. I wish the stealth portion had a few more mechanics at play, since Metal Gear proves you can have robust stealth elements whilst maintaining FPS elements without sacrificing from either. Otherwise, there's nothing to really exalt in this department; the maps allow tackling tasks in a few different ways and allow for diverging paths but there's nothing extraordinary to report. This isn't a critique, it's a standard all games should strive towards, which is competency and congruety.\n\nThe New Order is a competent shooter that entertains throughout its duration, but there's nothing particularly eye-catching or ground-breaking here. But there doesn't need to be to justify a purchase, whilst nothing is eye-catching its akin to a summer movie that's still worth the price of admission for entertainment's sake alone, which this title fulfills in spades.","December 11, 2015","true","50.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","2"

I don't like the id Tech 5 engine--it's not ugly, but the textures up close are fairly crummy, and once again (as with Rage) the engine often has an inability to "remember" textures that are behind you--if you turn quickly they have to fade in to compensate, which nearly kills the immersion (thankfully the characters and the story and the great gameplay mitigate this a bit).\n\nThere's secret to find the game, and as such there's replay value--I missed a good bunch of things.

It's interesting to see this franchise being brought to life by a studio that had no active games developed. And wow, what a game this turned out to be. These guys really showed love for the source material, don't get me wrong, it's not a perfect game but damn does it come close to one. The sheer amount of carnage on display, the gunplay, the health bar system, these guys blended modern FPS tropes with old-school run and gun mechanics so well, it's almost seemless. It's good. Really, really good. Well, Wolfensten TNO starts out fairly lame, with a turret section and we're being introduced to BJ once again and his co-pilot. It's a WW2 alternate mission, which sets the tone of the game fairly on. BJ talks in a Batman-esque voice, narrating stuff the entire game, but it's fairly well writen and voice acted so it's ok. After this we wake up after 10+ years in Poland, in an insane asylum. After BJ gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off he even gets out of his catatonic state and starts tearing nazi's a new one. It's fairly stupid at times (the story) but they really do try hard to evoke empathy and legitimate emotions from the player, but at times this fails because it's simply too over the top for my taste. Like the story doesn't quite fit the overall game (Looking at you GTA 4). But anyway, it's not bad or anything, given the fact the BJ was well known only for,well, killing nazis. It's decent enough to drive the plot and it's setpieces forward. The supporting cast is also excelently voice acted and everyone seems to be farily well written. The anthagonists in this game are superbly done. You need to view only one or two cutscenes to drive you mad and fill you up with the thirst of revenge. The game manages to make nazis even more hateable. But anyway, I could talk more in depth about the game, but the less said about this game the better, trust me\nSo let's break things down into two categories: Good and bad.\nThe good:Superb gunplay, old school run and gun mechanics blended perfectly with modern shooting\nLinear level design but with plenty of exploration, side paths and such, good enough\nThe graphics are really good for an iD tech engine, we know how Rage turned out on this\nAwesome enemy/backdrop designs, most of the time the architecture of it all steals the show\nDual wielding any guns (Assault rifles, shotguns etc)\nOvercharge system for full on carnage and a well designed stealth system, play the game your way\nPolished single player experience, 10-12 hours on a first playthrough with a 2nd one ensured by a binary choice early on\nExcelent voice acting, character development and decent storyThe bad:No multiplayer\nSome texture pop-in may ♥♥♥♥ some people off\nStealth could use some fine tuning (knives are fairly underpowered compared to the silenced pistol)\nSome plot stuff is a bit too over the top(Personal taste)\nThe whole Nazis rule the world concept isn't fully explored, lost potentional in some areas (Altough they did do the concentration camp part really well)This is my personal 2014 GOTY and it deserves it. 9/10 for this game, I recommend playing it on Uber since the game is fairly ballanced with the exception of a few ares where shotgun heavy dudes will gun you down easily and some cheap deaths will ensue.\nP.S: you fight nazis in space, underwater, in concentration camps, in a mental asylum.

It's playable, but was a tad more frustrating than enjoyable.\n\nThe story made good attempts at characterization within a grim yet laughable plot, making just enough coherence to be passable.  Nothing extraordinary, but felt a lot like a typical blockbuster movie with a silly plot but tried to have a serious overtone.  Enjoyable to watch but forgetful within a week.\n\nRecommendation: If you enjoy hollywood-style macho-man movies and FPS shooters, I would suggest getting this game on discount and spend a weekend on it.","May 29","true","12.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/niefart/recommended/201810/","niefart","ep!c™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/niefart/","438 products in account","Firstly, I need to point out I'm going to compare it mostly with Wolfenstein The Old Blood. Secondly I'm die hard fan of Wolf games, I finished both new Wolfs with 100% achievements and tried to play in every possible way, so you are reading review of Wolf lover, that's why I can exagerate some things :)\n\nSo pros & cons list:\n\nPros: (+)\nSuitable achievements (not getting boring, easy, but not too easy to do 100%)\nNice story and gameplay (let's write more about it... "NICE" is too weak word to describe it's awesomeness, I don't remember when I last time had thrills while watching cutscenes, I don't mean here that it's scary - sometimes it is, but I was just wataching it with open mouth, you have that feeling... that proper word to describe this story is EP!C\nNice game mechanics and overall gameplay. I mean here that some newer games focus too much on how to run, how to aim and such useless things, why in this one you can focus with 100% of your mind on awesome action and epic story.  Most of newer games are getting boring too fast because of that. I'm pretty sure that in next 20 years, this game will be called CLASSIC <3\nI was amazed by cutscene in Polish bedlam, loved the voice acting.\nCons: (-)\nBroken achievements for difficulties, at least while finishing game for the first time - I got only liberation achiv. while I finished game on Uber -.- A lot of topics in steam discussions are complaining about it.\nMusic, Wolf The Old Blood had much better music, while here music is just background, you play and don't hear it, while it should spice up the action >.< The only soundtrack that I heard and enjoyed was during 15th Chapter - Under Attack ("Ransacked").\nIT WAS TOO EASY! Probably the biggest disadvantage for me, maybe because I like challanges in games that I really enjoy? Nvm, I just mean here that in comparison to The Old Blood it was much much easier. I had some problems on Uber with The Old Blood, I didn't have here. Most of people won't mind anyway.\nThe Idea of Enigma codes (collecting & breaking the code) was really nice, but things that it unlocks (new game modes) were rather not worth trying. Only 999 mode is nice.\nSTRONG SPOILER: I hate the ending, maybe only my personal opinion... but yeah I'm happy ending lover and didn't like the way it was. And why the ** was he just looking ~3s on that granade?? :/ also didn't like how many times Blazkowicz was stabbed, opened, tortured and such, it leaves a bad feeling, he would be dead in the middle of game with more reality\nConclusion: I loved the game (even with some neglects)! It keeps up to the level which I would expect with the title. Play as nazi killing machine and enjoy! :3","December 10, 2015","true","31.2"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","17","23","0","0"

The verdict is in, Wolfenstein is AWESOME!   The screenshots chosen for steam suck, the game is very colorful and does what Thief tried to do but failed.  Machinegames showed they are worthy to wear the jewel in their gaming crown that is Wolfenstein.  From the story which includes things I thought I would never see in a game such as how the Germans treated people in concentration camps, to the visuals of driving a car off a bridge to smash up some Nazi scum.  Feels so good giving that payback they deserve so much.\n\nThe game has been criticized for being HUGE, people say its because of the textures.  They seemed ok, some parts like the bridge, they look PS2ish if you look up at the actual bridge.  Viewing the city, it looks dead, I saw a couple cars on one street, but that was it, no other cars moving, even Kane and Lynch had cars moving when your doing the window washing.  To minimize download, developers need follow what Sleeping Dogs and Skyrim did, have an HD texture download separate from the base download, if people want 100gb of textures fine, if not then dont shove it down their throat, we can have both.\n\nPicking up treasures, or unlocking characters are not that rewarding, you cant view the models in 3d, but oddly all these things even the treasures are rendered in 3D but all we get is a screenshot of the object to look at which kinda sucks. I suspect we were supposed to be able to view them but the team ran out of Wolfentime to make the UI.  You might think thats a made up word, but its a real word right off Machinegames site, suck it google spell check!\n\nThis game contains Bear, it is always strange to see in a game, only Saints Row 4 pulled off including a bear.  Bears r ppl too T_T.  How odd to see, how do they do that?  Somehow someone who created that character knows a bear.  Bears R everywhere :D\n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $99.99","July 1, 2014","true","44.6"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rock1m1/recommended/201810/","rock1m1","Rock1m1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rock1m1/","149 products in account","Welcome back Master!\nFirst Person Shooters has been around since decades, it is one of oldest gaming genres that hasn't much evolved since it first came out.  The foundation of it was so solid that despite with relatively minor tweaks here and there, the genre still sells millions and millions of copies annually with likes of Call of Duty and it provided one of the key platforms for competitive gaming through the likes of Counter Strike for example.\n\n\nLeading up to the release, I thought it was going to be just another shooter trying to market itself using the franchise's legacy. For the case of Wolfenstein, the legacy of being the first one there - thats right, the original Wolfenstein from id software is pretty much the first game that let you see through the eyes of the protagonist as you go from room to room, clearing enemies while wielding a gun on the bottom of the screen. Yep, it was the very 1st FPS in history.\n\n\nThe story takes place during the high point of World War 2 in Europe, you crash land into a Nazi occupied castle, accompanied by a small group of soldiers scattered from various regiments, you have a clear task of cutting the head of the snake and end this war. The game captures the agony of defeat at your most vulnerable time -  just when you thought you had it won. It carries a very powerful and emotional punch to the gut itself, but what transpires during those darkest hours will haunt you throughout the rest of the game. It further connects you to the game on a very personal level. The characters that you meet to help you fight against the Nazis aren't just there to move the story forward, they aren't your typical forgettable characters you find in most shooters, oh no, they feel like real people going through real hell thanks to the New World Order of the Nazis. Everyone here lost something dear and precious in the 'Old World' to the Nazis and hence have very personal vendetta against them. While on the other side of the fence the cruel and horror nature of the Nazi is brought to life through very well written, well designed and I can confidently say, well hated antagonists in the game. You just don't want to save the people around you, but you also really want to hurt the Nazis and give them no mercy of a quick death.\n\n\nFirst impressions are always going to be the visuals, and this game looks good, very good. Not just id tech 5 looks amazing here, from ultra crisp textures, great attention to detail in every corner to bring the world to life. What really caught my attention was the cinematography and the art style of the game: The game uses colors and their contrast to great effect, combined with the sheer attention to detail I mentioned before, it creates a visually ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic experience! The environments are very distinct and crafted with a lot of care and thought just like the rest of the game, no two places ever feels the same. Another thing to note, not only the game takes you to a wide variety of places across the world, but across the time as well. The art style, the condition of the world and it's inhabitants reflect this brilliantly.\n\n\nThe level design also gives the player a lot of options in dealing with situations and change tactics on the fly, which the game actually forces you to do so when playing in harder difficulty modes, which I suggest. The weapons are mostly standard you would expect from a sci-fi shooter with some cooling alternate firing modes and there is something incredibly satisfying when you can dual wield weapons like assault rifles, shotgun and even...rocket launchers..thats right..dual wield rocket launchers.\n\n\nWhat really stood out for me is also the main reason I will continue to come back to this game long after I finished it is how precise and satisfying the shooting mechanics felt. It is just pure joy to point your gun and just shoot. Further, the weapons feel solid, distinct and carry satisfying feedback all of which combine to make one of the best shooting experience possible . It is the most basic mechanic for a shooter, but you would be surprised that most fail to deliver here. Modern shooters have made great strides in graphics and other enhancements through this medium, but it also came at a price of deteriorating the key functionalities which made this genre timeless. A lot of the essence of the genre is getting lost with modern 'refinements' being made into the genre. It is very pleasant to discover that Wolfenstein have gone back to basics with their approach to shooting. I found the firefights challenging without being frustrating most the time on the 2nd highest difficulty mode I played. The AI was definitely smart to box me in, flank and even find higher ground to get a upper hand during combat situations.Oh yeah one more thing, the game doesn't even have regenerating health, Win!\n\n\nThere really isn't much negative I can think off to be honest, I guess I have to really nitpick and can I fine just one - some of the textures are oddly of low resolution which really catches the eye because they are at times placed right next to the usual high resolution textures of the game, making it a bit distracting. Also I am not sure why, but the game doesn't have proper anti-aliasing support on the PC, kinda shocking really as it is a standard feature of PC Gaming. Not that the aliasing is too distracting or anything, but it is always nice to clean those jaggies when you have the power at your disposal.\n\n\nWolfenstein is very likely not just my game of the year, but it is one of the most important games to come around in my opinion with a clear message: sometimes you have to embrace the past to guide you a better future.\n\n\nEditor's note: Since Bethesda also acquired the rights to another legendary shooter, DOOM. If they give that game the same level of treatment they gave to Wolfenstein, we can safely anticipate for another solid good comeback!","July 31, 2014","true","22.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskspark/recommended/201810/","Duskspark","Duskspark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskspark/","484 products in account","Classic shooters like DOOM, Shadow Warrior and Duke Nukem are slowly being killed off by generic and linear first person shooters. We were treated to quite some reboots and re-imaginings of classics lately, like Rise of the Triad, Duke Nukem Forever, Shadow Warrior 2013 to name a few. Some were good, but some were severely lacking their original vibe (for example regenerating health or a weapon carrying limit). Hearing about Wolfenstein: The New Order rekindled the old flames inside me that enthousiastically was waiting to bring some of those classic shooters in a modern coat, but I remained sceptical, because the line between a classic shooter and a modern-day parotic reboot is surprisingly thin. I expected it to be a seven-out-of-ten game based on what I had seen and heard about it, and for the first two hours of the game it was exactly that. After that, however, Wolfenstein: The New Order downright blew me away and immediately did everything right in a matter of minutes, raising my final score to a nine out of ten.\n\nThe Pros:\n· Classic shooters and killing nazi's fit together like pancakes and Nutella: it may be a bit sticky and eye-rollingly cliché at first, but damn is it good and satisfying.\n· A high-quality story with fantastic voice-acting and an sickly interresting main villain like we rarely/never get to see in modern-day shooters anymore.\n· Wolfenstein: The New Order's gameplay feels authentic without ever feeling like you've already seen it all. Guns handle very well and have a great feel to them, stealth options allow you to approach certain situations differently without  giving you the feeling that you have to go down that certain path, levels flow from tight corridors into larger open areas, and so on. It's jam-packed with features that are bound to attract almost any kind of gamer.\n\nThe Cons:\n· Every item has to be picked up individually. For example, you can't just run over weapons to collect their ammo or run over armor to wear it. It's not the biggest problem in the world, but I felt like it interrupted the game's pacing at some points.\n· For a single-player only game, I personally think 40 GB is a whole lot of space to spend on it. Not that it affects the game in any way, but some people simply can't spend that much space on installing a game. (Even though it's not really a gameplay-related downside, I decided to list it anyway just so you're aware of that. Hell, I have to list SOME downsides.)\n\nThe Visuals:\n· A-f**king-mazing. Stunning lighting, very solid animations, indrecible textures, fantastic overal design and so on. Definately one of the prettiest games in recent memory.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n· Wolfenstein: The New Order is easy to love and hard to hate. Some of its minor flaws can easily be overlooked with the high quality it delivers, as it finds the perfect way to bring a classic shooter in a modern-day coat without losing ANY of its charm. 9/10.","May 22, 2014","true","13.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

Is it worth the price? I'll break down what I feel are the strong and weak points.\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n- Definitely worthy as a successor/reboot of the series. Gunplay is solid and the action is responsive.\n- No major bugs and zero crashes in my playthrough of the whole campaign.\n- Ran very well on my 4+ year old setup (GTX 570 and an older i7, 8 GB of RAM) on a mix of High and Medium settings.\n- Not afraid to display the swastika and Iron Cross absolutely everywhere. The cityscapes of a post-German WWII victory look fantastic and memorable. Badass and brutal environment for a FPS.\n- Optional newspaper clippings and other documents expose the player to how this alternate history scenario happened.\n- Looks very nice and has a surprisingly high standard of voice acting and cinematography.\n- The German dialogue is very well done and you'll be hearing a lot of it throughout the game.\n\nCons:\n\n- Takes an extremely interesting alternate history scenario and doesn't take itself seriously enough to really flesh it out. This is more of a personal opinion and can be seen as a neutral point given the fact that the Wolfenstein series has always been about mowing down Nazis, not elaborating on them. The alternate history is very sci-fi, which is fun stylistic choice and serves the game itself well.\n- The newspaper clippings and other lore are nice tidbits, but they feel like they're just teasing the player when you realize that there is never any major exposition. What IS revealed though, is very interesting (Manhattan hit with an atom bomb to force the USA's surrender, the Nazis build a bridge across the Strait of Gibraltar, etc.)\n- Oddly disjointed storyline that doesn't feel rewarding to the player due to its sporadic focus and odd jumps in continuity (Minor spoiler: deciding to be purposely captured to be placed into a forced-labor camp with NO decision or setup from the player whatsoever - what?!).\n- Little variety in enemy types and overly high margin of difficulty between them (light enemies are trivially easy, heavy enemies can be a slog).\n- The unlock system only enables alternate gameplay modes, which doesn't contribute greatly to replayability. Definitely a one-and-done game.\n\n\n\nOverall, this is a solid pickup if you are looking for an enjoyable single-player FPS experience, but you may be lefting wanting more in the narrative. Very solid FPS gameplay and OK on the narrative/storyline. This game is worth picking up for at least one playthrough.","June 1, 2014","true","28.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

He sleeps in a coma for 14 years and when he finally wakes up, the world is now under Nazi rule. Your job is to find the resistance and have your revenge to kill Dr.Wilhelm Strasse.\n\n- Graphics : Even if this game came out as recently as of may 2014, the graphics are surprisingly gritty, flashy at times and realistic. The light reflections, shadows, explosions and soldiers, all look great.\nThe environments are very nice looking and you can definitely see how gritty and realistic the character's faces are. Maybe it's because I don't play a lot of recent games but I now realize how good the graphics are in this game.\n\n- Sounds : The sound effects of the weapons, the echo screams and vehicules are in excellent quality, the music is well done but tuned down a little in the main game to excite the players with more action packed gameplay.\n\n- Gameplay : The game is odviously a first person shooter, so the game needs more variety, options and difficulty to make it playable and adaptable.\nBut even though the main game is linear, it adds other paths to choose, different ways to kill ennemies, and, (like the old wolfenstein games), you can hold two weapons and shoot at the same time like a badass. there are of course the standard, shotgun, and massive ennemies.\nEven mechanical dogs try to jump at you. You can also rip the heavy machine gun turret to have it in your hands, which is something i personally haven't seen before.\nThere are some areas that you can kill everyone in stealth, so it's good to have that option but for me, I just like to go all out, straight out killing Nazis.\n\nBut it's not a perfect game of course. For example, most or possibly all boss battles are so easy, I really wish they added soldiers, making him more difficult to kill or anything creative to build the tension and releif of beating a powerful boss.\nThe moon mission was so interesting to me but it was quite rushed, get ready to have 3 minutes in space, have fun !\nAnd lastly, personally, i'm not particularly interested in the other vilains and other characters. I like the personalities of your crew but some are all around forgettable.\n\nIt's the basics of a fun first person shooter and this is the game that launched a new genre in gaming and manages to shows no signs of aging and/or distortion.\nI recommend playing this game on sale if you want a familiar look and feel of a classic, yet modern look, of one of the most important games of it's time.","December 26, 2015","true","9.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","0"

I can't explain it any other way. It must be something within the core of my being, I just loved this game. I'm not really doing Wolfensten: New Order (WNO) any justice here by saying that, as the game is just plain old fun - and not just because you get to shoot nazis.\n\nWNO managed to take me back to a time where FPS weren't about huge cinematic set plays within the gameplay, it was simply about being fast, frantic and frenetic. When all you wanted in a game was to run through corridors guns blazing  and to kill everyone standing in your way -- and this game delivers.\nThe game offers this in abundance with a huge range of guns to use along the way too, however it's not all about blazing through the levels. WNO offers the option for stealth with some very satisfying takedown kills. In fact 'satisfying' is a great word to describe WNO as a whole. The pacing, the soundtrack, the characters, the level design, the use of actual REAL accents from the voice actors make all of this satisfying. The developers have done a great job of balancing the pace of the game, knowing when to ramp it up and when to let it cool off for a bit before ramping it off again.\n\nAll in all WNO remembers what it is - a FPS. It some ways it manages to acheive something that the original Wolfenstein did over 20 years ago in defining the genre. I felt reinvigorated about playing First Person Shooters again after experiencing Wolfenstein.\nI'm sorry I hadn't played it sooner, if I had played this back in 2014 I'm pretty sure it would have been my GOTY (just beating Rogue Legacy). Essentially, it's one of the best FPS I've played in a LONG time and I can't recommend it enough.","January 6","true","21.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CDFW/recommended/201810/","CDFW","Riko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CDFW/","1005 products in account","Does anybody remember the time when video games were about doing? Not what a lot of fancy games have now with their set-pieces and linear levels and platforming sections. Some nostalgia freaks would call that "the good old days", but I would like to just say that it is what video games are about. It is what they are supposed to do, and what Wolfenstein: The New Order happens to do very well.\n\nI still remember the sound of the old Polish man in the game telling me "Kill all the Nazis" right before handing me a gun to blow their brains out with. This sort of mentality has two major plays within the game.\n\nThe first way this mentality applies is through the games atmosphere, dialogue, story, and character interactions. The game takes every opportunity to be very open that it is a "dumb shooter", and does not take itself too seriously. It is full of humorous lines poking fun at the average gamers' behaviour when you do something that would be weird to do in real life, but people do in games all the time. This makes the game natural, and connect with the player, making light about otherwise boring and mundane tasks in the game. These random pokes at the gamer do not come at the expense of the main character, whereby Mr. Blaskowicz never leaves his characteristic self to do things that he would never do. Which, his normal self of course is a dual assault rifle wielding human tank of Nazi killing death.\n\nThat leads to the second way the particular line of dialogue exemplifies the game: The game and its gameplay. The levels are pretty large to say the least, with lots of differing pathways and areas to explore, and go about completing fighting the Futuristic-Nazi scum. Think Deus Ex: Human Revolution size and style, but bigger, a lot bigger. All of this is crafted in heavily stylised, and excellently modelled and textured environments, that look absolutely gorgeous to be covering in a fresh coat of blood. Which happens when your head gets blown off by two autoshotguns firing miniature flak rounds out simultaneously. Yes, yes you can do just that. Dual wield any two weapons in the game (with the exception of the two handed weapons) at the same time, and rip through your foes at an astonishing rate. Of course this does not replace the good old fashioned iron sights, which are complimented nicely by a leaning/stationary-viewing key system that is smooth to the touch; the same goes for the rest of the keyboard inputs, making you leap, lunge, duck, run, and throw weapons with utmost fluidity.\n\nThis comes at a price however: the id tech 5 engine. Many gamers, mainly AMD users, seem to have issues running the game at all, or running it well once it is running. Considering this is a AAA contemporary release at the time of writing this, this is not surprising as game requirements are going up, and many people would expect to be able to run it on old systems would be disappointed. But the game leaves the gamer disappointed in other ways as well, mainly how the game handles some particular parts of the itself. One way it fumbles itself is sometimes the game will throw a “serious” part at the player (I can only think of one off the top of my head, and while it was sentimental and a legitimate plot point, it felt out of place). Another way the game messes up is with rather disappointing boss fights. While they are impressive to look at, and awesome to take down, they seemed a little weak compared to how some of the super soldiers in the game would kick your butt over and over and over again until you rage quit. This does not ruin the game, but this dichotomy does slightly take away from the experience.\n\nSome honourable mentions before I finish: The game has a stealth system, which is a little broken like in most games, but still viable for the most part. Nothing more satisfying than one shotting a Nazi with a throwing knife. As well, the OST is very atmospheric, and fitting for the game, lending itself well to the experience the player will feel throughout. The game has a lot of collectables to collect, including new difficulty modes you can unlock. The game has a perk system to make playing on higher difficulties marginally easier. The game uses limited regenerating health (just to a low threshold, like 20% of your hitpoints), and uses the health system where you need to find med kits to replenish your health (even allowing you to overheal yourself!). The game has a lengthy campaign lasting from 9-20 hours, with multiple endings and plot divergences. Lastly, the game's beds are just pure awesomeness.\n\nIf you could not tell by the thumbs up recommendation, I would recommend this game. It is a good old timey inspired, arcade shooter that is a boat load of fun to wade through pools of blood in. Killing Nazi's has not been awesome.","May 25, 2014","true","18.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","8"

I want to say this is Hands-Down the best first person shooter I've ever played. As far as Story, Game-Play and Design go.\n\nThis isn't just a game where you don't care much about the characters. Each character is unique in their personality. While this game often takes a serious tone, there still is humor at some points that'll at least make you chuckle a bit. The story is well done to the point where I repeatedly told myself only one more level and went on to do another\n\nThe game is well paced and doesnt just have you moving through areas gunning down tons of enemies every time. There'll be times where the stealth approach is better and there'll be times where it be best to go guns blazing. However, you do not have to play a certain way. With destructable cover, you'll find yourself running from cover to cover as the concrete blocks or metal panels you're taking cover behind get shredded to pieces.\n\nThroughout the game, you'll find different upgrades and variations of the weapons you have that keep the game feeling fresh. Never in this game did I get tired of the combat. From the beginning of the game, I knew I had to do at least a second playthrough of this game soon\n\nAll in all, if you enjoyed Bioshock and like a game that makes you feel badass, look no further.

The variety of not only missions and situations but also your own equipment and tactics is staggering. Just like in classic old school shooters you're allowed freedom in how you tackle situations. The gameplay never feels rigidly scripted and the player is free to break stealth into a deadly assault at their own choice.\n\nFor many people this will range from silently evading and assassinating targets one by one to running in guns blazing with your dual assault rifles in a relentless assault. The game promotes and encourages the player to experiment with a variety of both weaponry and multiple paths throughout the mission area. Despite being a game with linear progression, it never truly feels that way and offers a high amount of re-playability.\n\nOne notable example is a night time assault early in the game. While it encourages stealth, it is completely possible to run in loud. In-fact it is even possible to combine the two, silently killing the commanders and then zip-lining to the nearby roof. To open fire with your dual assault rifles on the Nazis below you. The possibilities presented are endless and just as open from one mission to the next, with minimum control by the game for certain story related events.\n\nHowever, I feel the true defining factor in TNO is the gripping weave of both intense gameplay and touching narrative. Despite being in an alternative universe with retro-scifi robotic Nazi soldiers, Machine Games was able to produce a world that contrasts clearly with ours and holds no punches back with its brutal reality.\n\nThe idea of a world controlled by the Nazis is very real and incredibly chilling. No expense is spared to show how such a world would function. The world is "perfect", under control of the regime and their fascist ideals. Every single facet of the Nazi doctrine is clear, the world is purged of the inferior; science is amoral and followed fanatically with a bent to weapons research to ensure maximum control and dominance. The world is rigid, inspected, "safe" and without due process. Everything monitored, controlled, and censored by the state.\n\nBut the story is more than just the bigger picture. The struggle of the resistance and of humanity is a huge focus as well. Characters are incredibly well written and display believable emotion that is aided by amazing acting, both the facial/motion capture actors and voice actors.\n\nIts heavy on the symbolism and commentary. Going as far as to point out the hypocritical violence and slaughter the main character thrives in, but even further to show the hypocritical treatment of minorities during the 1940s. Machine Games also had no problem showing the extent of human psychology and the way people attempt to justify their actions. The main antagonist justifies not only his creations but also of the Nazi idealism “It matters not what you destroy, but what of you Create”.\n\nTNO is not only a fun game, but also an intelligent one. Its a game that bucks the idea that video games are not art, that video games cannot be meaningful and that old school shooters are nothing more than mindless violence.

From the moment it first started, I was hooked. It just goes to show that not every game needs some crappy tacked on multiplayer component to sell or be good, and because of that, they have created an amazing story that is fun and engaging which i look forward to replaying.\n\nAll of the characters are likable, especially BJ, which is important as it gives the player a reason to be invested in him and the story and see him suceed against Deathshead, who you can't help love and also hate at the same time, a great villain. The character design is just as good, with great looking vehicles, weapons and unique enemy types such as the panzerhounds. The gunplay is fun and excting, most weapons come with secondary functions such as adding silencers, to changing the fire mode and the ability to duel weld them.\n\nYou can also unlock passive perks as you play, depending on how you play. Such as if you tend to play more stealithy, you will unlock the ability to pick up and throw knives. All of this works in the background so you don't need to manage any of it.\n\nThe game is full of collectibles as well as bits of paper cuttings and intel that expand upon the game world, and you actually want to read these, as they can be at times very funny as they try to link what would have happened if the Nazis had won. Such as The Beatles being forced to sing all of their songs in German, and their newest album, "Das Blaue U-Boot". There is even a nice easter egg, which I wont spoil, but it caught me by surprise and made me smile from ear to ear.\n\nThis will be my first review I have wrote because honestly this game deserves all the praise it gets. It blew me away and I was surprised at how well made it is and how much I enjoyed it. I encourage everyone to play this game and I hope more game companies realize you don't need a multiplayer slapped on.\n\n10/10","May 24, 2014","true","17.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrn-poosh/recommended/201810/","scrn-poosh","[ScrN]PooSH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrn-poosh/","173 products in account","Well, after Raven's Wolfenscheisse 2009 things simply couldn't get any worse. Task was simple: make an average old-school First Person Shooter game, and fans will say thanks for resurrecting a franchise. And MachineGames did it. They did it well, but unfortunately they couldn't get it any higher.\n\nGameplay MechanicsGood old FPS genre is back. No more magic, no more trading and other RPG parody that Raven tried to bring us in 2009. Classic guns only: pistol/machinegun/shotgun/sniper/grenades + new LaserKraftWerk (LKW) weapon, which after a few upgrades reminds me Railgun from Quake. Yes, there are weapon upgrades, which bring new fire modes and ammo types. There is a Minigun too, but it can't be stored in the player's inventory (both B.J.'s pockets are full with huge automatic shotguns, no place for minigun there), so it can be used until dropped, i.e. in specific areas only.\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order supports 3 playstyles:\nRun'n'gun. Introduced in Wolf3D, widely used in Doom and Quake and brought to ridiculous level in Painkiller and Serious Sam. All weapons can be dual-wielded, even sniper rifles. Converting Nazis into pile of meat with dual automatic shotguns is fun. Unrealistic, ridiculous but fun. There were several pictures of B.J. Blazkowicz holding two miniguns back in Wolfenstein 3D. And it was finally implemented in The New Order. +1 for sticking with roots.\nCovering. When you are low on ammo (dual-wielding eats ammo fast) or just prefer precise shooting over "Ramboing", you can hide behind the cover, leaning out of it and taking enemies one by one with precise headshots or short bursts. This mode is even more authentic to Wolf3D or RTCW, because while playing on hardest difficulty I often ended up with like 4% health and 8 ammo and was supposed to switch from minigun back to pistol and lure Nazis around a corner, killing them one by one. The New Order enhanced it greatly. No need to strafe out of cover, you can just lean out of it. Most covers can be destroyed or just shot though. This can be advantage or disadvantage depending who are behind the cover: you or enemy :)\nStealth. Sneak behind an enemy and silently take him down with a knife without alerting others. Good idea but implementation sucks (see next chapter).\n\nAIWhen you are run'n'gunning, you don't care about how smart or dumb (mostly dumb) future peace of meat is. Your only task is to kill them as fast as possible to avoid becoming dead meat yourself.\nWhen using covering technique, enemies seems quite smart, if word "smart" can be used together with AI at all. Nazis are actively using covers, don't lean out of them too often, sometimes changing covers and position, sometimes sticking to the same position, but sometimes run at you all together from different positions. Variety in AI behavior makes the gameplay interesting.\n\nBut when you are in sneak mode, AI is dumb as ****. I'm wondering how Nazis could win the war, if their guards are always looking in wrong direction? It's fine, when you sneaked though the vent and got yourself behind the enemy. But if there is no vent, cellar or other way around, then guards always will be looking away from entrance, stairways etc. But that isn't the biggest issue. It seems like Nazis have no perception at all. They are able to see crouched player only if he is directly in front of them. And even in that situation they need to look at you for a few seconds, ask "Was ist das?" and only then, if player is stupid enough to sit still and not hiding around a corner, enemy triggers an alarm. I "like" how Nazis are completely ignoring dead bodies:\n- Your friend is lying dead on the ground with a knife in his back?\n- Nothing to worry about. That Nazi scum deserved it. I'll just walk though his dead body and continue patrolling an area.That's stupid. Sneak kills are lame and easy, and nothing changes on raising difficulty. I made first playthough on "I am Death incarnate!" and second on "Uber". Uber enemies are harder to kill, they do more damage, but it doesn't really matter, because by default most of them turned their back at you are waiting for a silent knife strike. You can use pistol with silencer instead, but it is harder, because you need to aim to the head. If you missed, then it can take up to 10 bodyshots to kill an armored enemy on hardest difficulty. But in the same time it is enough with one knife thrown to the butt to achieve instant kill.\n\n\nGraphicsCorridor graphics are nice. Everything is high detailed and pretty. And it runs well on medium-spec hardware. When going outside... well, those "skyboxes" imitating futuristic Nazi cities could have higher detail.\n\n\nStoryOriginally posted by John Carmack:Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie.\nIt's expected to be there, but it's not that important.I'd agree with a "father" of Wolfenstein, Doom and Quake, but not in this case. Starting from very beginning The New Order was promoted with an unique and intriguing story in an alternate history line: Year 1960, Nazis won the World War II. If you check all teasers and trailers, then most content is about story, about the world ruled by Hitler, not about gameplay itself. Story supposed to be the primary aspect in The New Order, but does it?..\n\nI'll spoil a little bit below. But to be honest, there is nothing to spoil here. It is like spoiling a porn movie with saying how it will end :)\nGame starts in 1946. Germany didn't lost in 1945, World War II still continues. B.J. Blazkowicz was sent to some kind of castle (again) to fight a bad guy, but he failed and got trapped (again), but then again. he managed to escape. Classic Wolfenstein story, starts like good old Wolf3D and RTCW.\nDuring the escape BJ gets contused and sent to Polish asylum. After recovery he kills Nazi guards and escapes -- now from the asylum -- taking a pretty girl with him to make a place for a love story. Drives into some kind of Polish village, where old lady explains him that he spent in asylum 14 years, WWII was ended in 1948 with capitulation of USA, and Nazis are ruling the world now. BJ decides to go to the Berlin to find some Resistance and fight The New Order.\n\nUp to this point developers created not only an unique story, but the whole new universe. Like there are Allies universe, Fallout universe, Metro universe etc., there could be a place for Nazi universe. And it could hold story not only story for one game, but even for trilogy, or at least of a few good mission DLCs.\n\nBut unfortunately developers screwed up everything at that moment. Instead of getting deeper into own universe, they started copy-pasting from other games. My personal expectations were to see the Nazi World: how cities look like, how environment changed, how people live in that world etc. Even Return To Castle Wolfenstein (RTCW) back in 2001 had own atmosphere: there were civilians like bartender, housewives and even drunken German soldier in wine cellar. There was WAR, but we could see a life beside it. In New Order there is no life despite War has been ended 12 years ago. Instead of making a new world, developers just used post-apocalyptic theme. Empty streets, bunkers and ruined buildings - it's all that you can see in the next 12 chapters. Sad but true...\n\nProsGameplay sticks to old school FPS genre, enhancing it into a good way.\nKilling Nazis is fun as always.\nGood visuals.\nSoundtrack is great. Listening The Beatles and "House of the Rising Sun" in German is funny too.\nFirst part of the game have interesting and intriguing story line.\nConsStealth mode is too easy.\nInteresting story at the beginning quickly turns into Call of Duty: Wolfenstein.\nMost maps are using post-apocalyptic theme, which contradicts the story line.","January 16, 2015","true","31.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

The shooting is either too easy or lacks some punch to make it feel, like the classics. I mean the enemies are varied and fun to fight, also the gun arsenal is awesome, despite the lack of "not hit scans weapons", but there´s a lack of identity at the hour of fighting them, since at times firefights can turn into a bland task, also the levels can also be nice to look at but not fun to play.\n\nWith that being said, this is my main grasp on this game. I don´t see myself replaying this one as much I do RTCW or even Wolf3D. But when this game clicks, it clicks. Firefights sometimes will make you use the whole environments and all the weapons against the different kind of enemies, adding the option doing stealthy was a plus, since in the end give options for everyone who have a preferred play style, or to adapt in any situations.\n\nThe gameplay was good, but the star of the show got to be the story. In my humble opinion this was better told and suit better the gameplay than any of the Bioshocks games, the way they present the story in a cinematic way, helps a lot too. But this is a great script filled with awesome side characters.\n\nIn the end this is a worthy entry in the wolfenstein series, in the end everyone have their favorite.","May 13","true","14.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/recommended/201810/","DangerousSaiga","Dangerous Saiga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/","221 products in account","Wolfenstein: The New Order is an underrated game in 2014 that combines both old school and contemporary gameplay elements, reviving the traditional series back to its roots. Playing as William "B.J" Blaskowicz (the "John Rambo" of World War II), you are assigned on a mission to take down an old nemesis, but significant backfire cause the Nazis to win the war, and the world. The New Order takes a different approach to the series as the main plot plays an alternate history scenario blending with Nazi technological enhancements that you would see in a science fiction movie. While the setting feels more of "cyberpunk", the unsettling moments on living in a Nazi-dominated world is surreal. Many literatures, films, and games romanticize the Nazis, but The New Order plays in a realistic fashion. The developers, Machine Games, consist of formal members who made Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay and The Darkness, effectively knows how to draw an audience with their well-written story.\n\nThe story and setting is arguably one of the best in recent video game development in a long time. Dark, gritty, sadness, and horror weighs a lot in the game as survival, hope, brotherhood, friendship, and family counters these negative sentiments. Each character in the game is well developed and character dynamics are genuinely impressive. The relationships among Blaskowicz and other characters he interacts with feel human. While the game feels black, occasional humor and one-liners lighten the mood. The main plot may seem like a typical revenge attribute, surprising moments for various characters and the effects of Blaskowicz's actions on a raid in a Nazi laboratory to the unexpected uprising in a concentration camp will immediately capture the attention of the person who's playing the game.\n\nGameplay is one of the most important features in the game. As mentioned before, old school attributes like picking up medic packs, health and armor numbers, and the 90s feel hit the spot for many Wolfenstein veterans and long time fans as well as attracting newer audiences into the fray. Fluid is the best vocabulary to describe the gameplay element. You can go guns ablaze, tactical and use of explosives, or just go stealth - quiet, deadly, and with great satisfaction. Certain easter eggs smack many veterans with great amour - kudos to the developers. Effort were put in such as authentic German language for enemy soldiers' dialogue, gameplay fluency, environmental display, and humanistic characters, including the excellent background story from various newspaper articles (on how the Nazis were able to dominate the world) that you can read at the Kreisau Circle Resistance base.\n\nWhen Wolfenstein: The New Order was announced in 2013, a considerable minority of gamers cast doubt that it will be a typical game and is nothing too special than other FPS in the market even when the game was close to release date. And boy, how many gamers were wrong about this game. Machine Games has done an excellent job on their development and story as well as polish the game. There's no doubt in my mind that The New Order will do well. Many people should have faith on those developers; they know what they are doing. I finish the game, feeling extremely satisfied. When Machine Games will release the sequel, it will be an instant purchase to support them. I have high hopes for the developers for their superb debut game of Wolfenstein: The New Order. One of the best (and under appreciated) games in 2014. Go get it.","October 1, 2014","true","26.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

From all of the previews and trailers, it came off like a wacky but derivative Call of Duty game with Nazis in it. I'm very glad to say I was completely dead wrong.\n\nWolfenstein the New Order is surprisingly enough a sequel to Wolfy 09 and Return to Castle Wolfenstein. It has a vastly different approach then either of those two games. TNO takes place in an alternate reality 1960 where Germany won the war after discovering the Atom bomb. This allowed the game to have extremely good imagery like sci-fi war mechs and power armor alongside classic Wolfenstein tropes like over the top guns. You have a really cool arsenal of weapons ranging from dual wielding assault rifles to hand held lasers that let you melt holes in walls.\n\nHowever what TNO does best is it expands upon previous games. The protagonist Bj Blazkowicz isn't a static brick in this game like he was in Wolfy 09 or RtCW. He has a surprisingly good internal monologue that portrays him as a very shell shocked and emotional individual, completely unlike the stock American action film portrayal previous games had. This actually makes the storyline far more relatable then it was in previous games.\n\nWith the gameplay and story locked down, the last most defining feature of TNO is it's art direction. From it's enemies like I mentioned earlier to it's really top notch aesthetics. The maps remain fairly linear and enclosed but it makes up for it with the impressive attention to detail in many of the levels.\n\nWolfenstein the New Order is how you do a sequel to a retro game series well. You do your research and pay respect to earlier games while also expanding upon the mechanics. It's a very charismatic yet humble game, and it comes very highly recommended from me.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=424154323","April 12, 2015","true","9.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

As Wolfenstein of the past is more or less just a twitch-y first person shooter and this one has more cut-scenes than it did previously. The gameplay loop goes something like this; Shoot all the things, make it go boom. America is the best. BJ Blazkowicz regrets his past, walk around with some people that are vaguely interesting. Maybe collect something for one or more of them. Shoot all the things, make it go boom.. America..\n\nAnd it just goes on like that. There is nothing wrong with this game. Its just innocuous. I am neither mad at the time I spent playing it nor am I glad I bothered to take the time. It has it moments, its a true summer blockbuster. I personally just didn't care for it in the end. But it is extremely competent mechanically. The stealth feels good. Weapons feel properly powerful.

I finished the game with a smile yet sad face, a smile on my face because I enjoyed the game. a sad face because the ending crushed my heart.\n\nGameplay:- Now Wolfenstein isn't any different from other FPS games. you point and shoot. pick up ammo, pick up health and go destroy some nazi's. in any brutal way you see fit. what's different in Wolfenstein however, is its perk system. You dont have to accumulate some exp and waste its point on the perk. you actually need to fulfill some objectives to each perk in order to activate it and unlock the next on the line. I find that system a bit challenging. specially when I try to sneak and assassinate. I dont have the patience to sneak anymore... so I go in guns blazing and shooting the hell out of the nazi's.\n\nSound/Music:- The Voice acting is amazing. everyone did their roles perfectly. and so much that sucked me in the game. This is a critical part for me. if voice acting sucks, I wont be dragged in and I will probably lose interest in the game. Wolfenstein however did not disappoint, the cast was brilliant. The music also was great. well done, well placed. gets you hyped in locations where you need to be hyped.\n\nGraphics/animation. Wolfenstein is not a major leap  in future graphics. the graphics are just well done. Not amazing, not eye candy, Just normally right. it feels like the people who made it poured their souls into it. these kind of games I really like to support. Unlike the crap crysis 2 and 3... sheesh. these games are graphically nice, but felt dull and boring.\n\nOverall, Wolfenstein The new Order is a great game. I enjoyed it fully.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strangemodule/recommended/201810/","strangemodule","strangemodule","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strangemodule/","339 products in account","Disclaimer: Beat main campaign on "I am Death Incarnate!" (2nd highest difficulty) in 9 hours.\n\n~THIS REVIEW DOES NOT HAVE SPOILERS!~\n\nThis game is pretty good! Not without its flaws of course, but ultimately a satisfying game. Wolfenstein: The New Order only has a single-player campaign, and ultimately benefits greatly from it. Since the focus was aimed all on that experience, the mechanics, story, and little details are polished to a shine unseen in many other First-Person Shooter campaigns.\n\nThe overall gameplay mechanics satisfied me greatly. You move fast and loose, and are encouraged to run around and firing at people while strafing. Your accuracy doesn't suffer while moving, so you can easily be on the move as you fight enemies. This is a great departure from many FPS game's desire to make you use cover as a major factor of combat, whereas you only use it as something to dodge bullets and reload before you're on the move again. The stronger enemies make you want to stick to cover more, but by the time you start dealing with them you'll be very familiar with how to fight.\n\nThe health usage also hearkens back to the old days of numerical health. You have to get healthpacks in order to heal yourself, although there is a nice anti-frustration regenerating health system. If you are between two multiples of 10 (for example, between 30 and 40 health), if you don't take anymore damage for a second you will heal back to the higher fence of 10. Say, you got left at 34 health, you would heal back to 40 if you didn't take damage for a few moments. Also, if you fall below 20, you will heal back to 20 again eventually. I found this to help validate the use of healthpacks as a way to more permanently get your health up, encourage more active gameplay and minimize usage of cover to gain HP back. I feel this kind of system is one of the best health systems in an FPS yet.\n\nThe story engaged me much more than many do, especially in that it made Nazis look like total scumbags. They already are of course, but there's something about seeing Nazis torture people in coldly efficient ways and kill innocent people that really fires one up. The nazis sometimes show off moments of humanity when you hear them talk about their families or they try to help each other, but I found these moments to show off even more how evil they are because they only care about their own and willfully turn a  blind eye to the suffering of their fellow non-Nazi humans. The recurring Nazi characters especially exemplify this, as they show vestiages of personality and class yet enjoy being cruel to everyone else; they explicitly take pleasure in torturing and killing anyone they deem of "impure blood". It's very cathartic when you get to deal with them.\n\nAs for the arcs the story goes in, they are satisfying and full of spectacle in the right way. You are driving the story, and you get the feeling that without your character everyone else would be still pretty screwed against the Nazi regime. Not to say the other characters are unnoteworthy; each of them adds flavor and personality, and you can tell how tired and worn they've become from being under such a terrible regime.\n\nLastly, I just want to gush for a moment over the game's subtle details. For starters, you can pick up objects near you without looking at them; this little feature saved me a LOT of frustration in trying to look at objects the "right" way to pick them up. Secondly, the focus on single player resulted in plenty of collectables to obtain. You can find music records (and listen to them!!), Nazi gold, Enigma Codes that unlock a new game mode, and plenty more. Lastly, you can find lots of newspaper clippings that fill in the details about what happened in between World War 2 and the Nazis taking over the world. I don't think these things would be in the game if Machine Games was pressured to make a tacked-on multiplayer.\n\nI did have some complaints of course:\n\n1) One of the more annoying things I had to deal with during combat is that it's difficult to tell sometimes if you are taking damage, and the degree you are taking it, until your screen is grayed out when you are near death. This is probably due to the high difficulty, but oftentimes I took focus from enemies and lost a majority of my health. Granted, such damage soaking is mitigated by being careful, but some more obvious notifications on how hurt I am would be nice.\n\n2) The story went from believable to absurd from time to time. There are moments where I felt like you just did something that would warrant the entire Wehrmacht breathing down your neck, but only got a small squad going after me in response. Furthermore, some of the ways you "even the odds" are just straight up silly. They definitely are satisfying as hell to witness, even if they threaten suspension of disbelief.\n\n3) The second phase of the final boss fight was obnoxiously obtuse. You can't fight the boss directly yet, so you have to do something that isn't intuitive and only vaguely implied. I don't exactly want handholding here, but better map design could have prevented this issue.\n\n4) Very nitpicky point, but your ability to dual-wield weapons is an awesome yet impractical ability. You'll burn through ammo without careful shooting, and the single weapon does the job against most enemies. The only time I felt encouraged to dual-wield was when facing the most tanky of baddies, but sometimes it's not even necessary.\n\n5) Also nitpicky, but this game features a "overheal"; if you grab health that would give you more health than your cap (100), you get the difference added to your health anyway but it will tick down your health until it settles on 100 again. This is ideal when you want to go toe-to-toe with lots of enemies or the really fat ones, but I honestly felt like it was a waste. I found it a better idea to wait until my encounter was over, then grab the health later to get back to 100 if I was injured severely.\n\nOverall, Wolfenstein: The New Order impressed me on how powerful the story was and mechanically sound the game played. If you're looking for a cohesive, detail-filled, and just plan fun single-player game, you're looking at it.","October 2, 2014","true","10.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I recommend the game for that initial rush of excitement, and because it's a mostly well-executed shooter with satisfying, if simplistic, shooting action.\n\nBut there are a ton of flaws. It does that thing where you stop just shooting Nazis, and spend more of your time fighting mecha-Nazi whatevers. The boss fights are uninspired and more frustrating than challenging. It has checkpoints. The bad guys best you in cut scenes in ways that would never work if they didn't take away your control. There are a bunch of doors that don't do anything. There are some supremely boring HQ fetch quests where you can't even fire your weapon at imaginary Nazis, and there are puzzles that aren't puzzling during the game.\n\nThis game commits a lot of design sins, but it still leaves you feeling good about your purpose.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/201810/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Does this game break any outstanding barriers when it comes to FPS? No.\n\nIs this game's single player FPS just as good or even greater than Metro? Yes, and depends who you are.\n\nWhen I was first recommended Wolfenstein, I really couldn't care for the series. I knew it was some old time Doom sort of game that probably hasn't seen a good upgrade. It was recommended again and I caved. I'm glad I did.\n\nThe story starts off with you, an American soldier, in WW2 fighting off nazi's. Not just any nazi's though, these ones are quite technologically advanced and have some odd soldiers on their side. Eventually, the main character  becomes captured by one of the scientists and years pass as the main character is in rehab in Poland after taking shrapnel to the head. The character then leaves rehab as patients start disappearing and the home care workers are forced out. The real story and fun starts around this point.\n\nThe story lead up is a bit slow, but the game has no problem giving the player different experiences as an FPS. You will fly a plane, you will drive a car, and other small gimmicks that make the game enjoyable. It adds depth and makes the game that much more profound to continue playing. I would put this shooter on par with metro as dismemberment and effects when shooting a soldier are quite spot on.\n\nMy absolute favorite feature about this game (which I hope every game may incorporate) is the ability to control your movement behind cover. Are you behind a wall? Are you crouching behind cover? In any scenario, the player (on a controller) can hold L1 and with the joystick position the player around a wall or over cover to minimize exposure to enemy bullets. There are no shortage of weapons to choose from, and they made it possible to dual wield almost any gun. A specialized laser weapon is also given to cut through certain obstacles to enable progression throughout the story. The laser weapon can also be changed into a high burst beam where it can be used against enemies. Other weapons feature some sort of modification when it comes to shooting (often right D pad changes the fire settings). What is quite remarkable is the scenery's reaction to bullets. Enemies that are hiding behind cover can have it be shot away by the player leaving them vulnerable. This also applies to the players scenario where taking cover for too long behind a breakable barrier will lead to damage due to absent cover. Unlike call of duty, the environment can be to an extent blown away and damaged by bullets or explosions. Although it's not to the extreme where things will start disappearing, the concept of being able to almost destroy any cover an enemy is hiding behind is quite appealing, visually and for the game play. The AI's do not seem linear and will seek to come to you from any side. Flanking is not as popular as Deus Ex in this case, but traces of enemy brilliance are there.\n\nThe visuals are quite neat and the graphics play well. The game can ask quite a bit from your machine at times. I have not noticed any frame rate issues (either than you may need to V-sync) and that the sounds are rich and plentiful.\n\nThe story is great, and even develops the main character. I was hoping as so because "killing nazi's" attitude gets real old, real fast.\n\nI want to give this game an 8 for being a good FPS shooter giving the player quite a bit of control over what goes on, but I feel like that little bit more is missing. Could easily be an 8 with local co-op or multiplayer.\n\n\nRATING : 7.8/10\n\n\nFor future Wolfenstein's, maybe add a multiplayer depth for a lot of re-playability (or local co-op) and adding more explosive/modifiable environment options would be fantastic. The ability to shoot away cover is huge, but imagine having more control of what the room looks like.\n\n\nScreenShots :\nLike fighting in David and Goliath scenarios?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/201810/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","Wolfenstein hasn’t been a strong franchise since Wolfenstein 3D. I’ve had a reasonably good time with all the later titles. But I wouldn’t hold up any of them as particularly strong shooters. I went into The New Order with cautiously optimistic expectations. I’m glad to say it exceeded them.\n\nThe mood of the game feels almost ethereal. It reminds me a lot of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. Which maybe shouldn’t be a surprise since it’s by the same people. The New Order goes for the “play the way you want” school of FPS design. Combat arenas are open with plenty of alternative routes, and the AI is designed to allow for both stealthy and gung ho play styles. And it works! It doesn’t have sophisticated stealth mechanics, but they do the job. And what I mentioned earlier about the mood is conveyed in large part by the music. It hits just the right note for this type of game. It doesn’t stress you in any way. The voice over and dialogue is similarly subdued to not make you feel stressed. All this made it feel nice to be in the game world.\n\nDespite this the game has a slew of problems, like the combat. In other FPSes like Serious Sam or Shadow Warrior you learn instinctively how to react to certain enemies. Like how you’re supposed to move in order to avoid their attacks. In Wolfenstein I never had a solid idea of how enemies really behaved. I’m scratching my head just thinking of how I’d describe the optimal strategy to taking out normal soldiers, or shotgun dudes, or the tough armored soldiers. It doesn’t feel like they’re designed to have an optimal strategy you can learn. Just shoot them all in the head and hope for the best. The design just isn’t good enough for a game of this length. It’s the same with the health system. It doesn’t have regenerating health, but I wish it did, because this wasn’t designed well enough to work without it. Sometimes there’s not enough health packs, and sometimes there’s way too many. It was rarely “just right”. It’s not a complete disaster, but far from ideal.\n\nIt has other minor annoyances like how it randomly chooses which weapons you have at the start of each level. Sometimes you get to keep your sniper rifle between maps. Sometimes you don’t. At one point it disappeared for several hours, only to reappear in my inventory for no reason, with all my other guns removed. There was no satisfactory in-game excuse for this, so it seemed like the game was screwing me over for no reason. Let me keep my guns you ♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nThe story also had obvious problems. There’s subplots that don’t go anywhere, and the drama curve is off. Meaning that when you reach the finale there’s no sense of occasion. The game hasn’t built up to that moment properly, so there’s no feeling of anticipation or excitement. Instead it just sort of happens. Overall I liked the story. It tried to make the main and supporting characters into actual characters, and it kind of worked. I’ve seen some describe it as laughably bad, and I don’t agree with that. This is head and shoulders above the current FPS average. It needed more time in editing though. The issues are glaring.\n\nDespite all the problems I really liked the game. The stuff that sucked didn’t ruin the game for me. It still had elements strong enough that the problems didn’t matter. It would’ve been nice had the combat and story been better. But even with those issues it managed get enough things lined up right that it clicked. I wanted to see what was around the corner. I was never bored. That’s why I hope this team gets to do another singleplayer FPS. They’ve got a good thing going here. Try again, and maybe you’ll make a classic.","July 18, 2014","true","12.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The game overall is great looking; backgrounds and world look fantastic even in lower resolutions.  The game play is pretty typical of any FPS with the exception of the dual wield function which you can do with almost any weapon.  You can really do some damage when you fire with both of the assault rifles or shotguns at the same time, or better yet set one assault rifle to fire rockets and one to fire bullets.  The dual wield sniper rifles are a little silly but novel and fun to try.  You cannot mix and match (ie one shotty and one assault rifle).  Game play is mostly shoot'em up, but there are a number of areas where stealth is strongly advised and encouraged.  There is a pretty good selection of weapons but typically at the beginning of each level your weapons are removed and you have to start with what the game gives you for that level and what you can find during the mission.  Weapons include knives, grenades, pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles and the laserkraftwerk which is a laser rifle with a number of upgrades available (its cutting feature is also important).  All the rifles have alternate fire modes (ie rockets on the assault rifle, shrapnel ammo for the shotty etc.)\n\nControls are pretty standard.  One thing I didn't like was the slide function.  On a standard keyboard you have to hold down "W and SHIFT" to run forward, then tap CTRL to slide under obstacles.  It's fairly awkward and you will have to do it half a dozen times throughout the game, plus 3 times while killing an enemy to earn a perk.\n\nPerks are a major feature of the game and are split up into 4 categories (Stealth, Tactical, Assault and Demolition) with 8 perks per category.  Earning perks gives you access to better weapon mods and features .  Killing enemies with knives in various ways and in certain numbers will earn you stealth perks while killing with grenades or rockets will earn you demolition perks as an example.  The one downside to this system is you generally must obtain one perk before moving onto the next.  So in the case of Demolition you must kill 10 enemies with grenades before you can work on the next perk which is to kill an enemy commander with a grenade.  Even if you already killed a commander in the first 10 enemies, it won’t count toward the new perk.  Perks are permanently part of your character once earned.\n\nThe game has a deep story and cinematics, most of which can be skipped on a second playthrough, but some you will have to sit through a second time (ie the train scene).  Most of the story is good, but gets a bit tedious in spots.  Fighting Nazis on the moon is tough to beat!\n\nIf you are a person who likes a lot of collectibles, this game has them in spades: enigma codes, gold pieces, health boosts, personal letters that give various peoples stories of the Nazi world etc.  They’re all relatively easy to find (I got 75-90% on my first play through), but a few are tricky and Steam guides are a big help.  There are a couple of others (concept art and characters) that are triggered automatically when you encounter a character or area of a map.  The enigma codes unlock other game play modes when you manage to crack them.\n\nAchievements are all pretty easy to get; there are 50 overall.  All of the 32 perks generate an achievement when you get them, most of the rest are for collectibles and making it through various stages of the game.\n\nSome of the downsides : too short overall, no multiplayer, AI is wak in spots (this is NOT Dishonored), highly linear (this is NOT Fallout New Vegas) whihc affects re-playability and the save feature is limited to game autosaves.  The autosave is especially annoying as it overwrites if you decide to replay a previous chapter from the menu.  If you do decide to re-play a previous chapter, do it once you have finished your current chapter so as not to lose any game play.\n\nOne word of advice with respect to the perk feature, keep an eye on it constantly and try to determine if a given situation you are in most suited to obtaining a certain perk.  I would even go so far as to recommend playing the first mission a few times over before moving on to try to pick up as many perks as possible.  Otherwise you may find yourself playing the game the way the perk system forces you to instead of the way you want.\n\nI’m not sure whether or not this is worth $60.  I think the casual FPS fan would feel it is overpriced.  Probably $30 is a good trigger price.\n\nAs a final note unlike others I did not have any hardware issues (i7-960 Bloomfield, EVGA GTX 570, 12GB RAM and Asus P6X58D Mobo).  My system is about 3 years old.","May 26, 2014","true","52.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Oh how I was wrong.\n\nYes, I still got all the Nazi mayhem I wanted. Duel wielding automatic shotguns, assault rifles, rockets, and heck, even sniper rifles. Is it plausible or nessecary? Nope, but its Wolfenstein so why the hell not? All the run gun fun from older shooters has made it into this game as well as the level design. Most levels allow for a nice amount of exploration, and award the player for exploring secret passageways by gifting them various upgrades and ammo. There is an option of going sneakily, with silenced pistols and knives being present in your inventory for this(and yes, you can duel wield both). Gameplay gets a 9.5/10, the .5 being shot off by a stray shrapnel shot by a shotgun Nazi because he violates everything in the vicinity.\n\nNow... the story. Comming into the gameplay, and remembering this is the Wolfenstein series, one would expect very little justification on why we should kill Nazis, when its the main reason we bought this game. Yet the story takes a very surprising turn when it actually starts depicting the horrors that they have put upon the world, giving you fresh new reasons to brutally murder them. As the story goes on and on, your rage against the Nazis increases further and further, and luckily, the game knows it, because by the end when you reach the final level, ready to shove your knife down the main guys throat, all that stands between him and you is fifty million Nazis and Mechs, giving you plenty of room to work off your feels. And speaking of feels, this game just loves making you feel. All the characters displayed have some sort of personality, have a goal, and are flawed. I really liked each character, and how their story progressed. Without any spoilers, the story progressed in a direction I did not like at all, making me hate the Nazis with an even stronger passion. When I got to the last chapter, I was livid from what happened eariler, and simply couldn't wait to start tearing that place inside out. Once I had finished the chapter and saw the ending, my feels went supernova, and it was quite a heck of a ending for the game. There is the whole dual path thing where you can choose the outcome of a certain choice in the beginning to alter the timeline, but this doesn't change much besides a few paths and dialouge, the story is still intact. Also, being a Wolfenstein game, this game does have some weird spots here and there so that the plot can progress accordingly, while making little sense in the progress. Those are far and few and between though, earning the story aspect a 9.5/10.\n\nFinal Verdict: Want some of the funnest old-school gameplay this year has to offer along with a surprisingly well crafted story designed to make you feel and to engross you into the game even more? Pick this up at your next summer sale! One run took me 14-16 hours, and I'm planning on hitting up at least two more runs(alternate timeline, and a custom game mode one).","June 6, 2014","true","40.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","2"

It takes the best of both worlds and runs with it. With it's singleplayer focus, it adds a much more meaningful experience. It might not have multiplayer, but I will be playing this over and over again, trying out the different paths in the solo experience that I hadn't before.\n\nGunplay? Satisfying as all hell. Good god, not once since Sniper Elite have I ever thought shooting a guy in the head would be so satisfying. This game is literally gunporn. You can dual weild guns, which does slow you down and adds inaccuracy, but definately packs a punch. You can slide across the floor and shoot your gun, take cover and shoot, pull a lever and shoot simutaneously. It's just so convenient and satisfying. There's tons of room for trickshots. It's even better with its fictional guns, which are seriously AWESOME.\n\nThe gore? Awesome. I ♥♥♥♥ing love all the blood and guts. This is one of the bloodiest games I've ever played in recent years. You can blow a guys head off and see all the chunks, throw a grenade and see the body blow up, defeat a boss and see his chunks splash all over. Holy ♥♥♥♥, it's awesome.\n\nI recommend playing on harder difficulties to get the most out of your experience. I personally find the lower difficulties and even normal a bit too easy.\n\nThis game is highly recommended for people who love shooter games like myself.

But were they true?\n\nHELL YES! I enjoyed the game from the first moment to the last, the plot is really well written, and even a person who haven't played its predecessors will quickly find himself in the world of Wolfenstein. Playability of this game is through the roof - you can almost feel the joy of killing every damn Nazi (maybe I'm just a sick person). Graphical side of the game is generally satisfying.\n\nThe controls are very responsive and after a few hours of play you already feel like an MLG pro. Perks are cool addition (they are kinda standard in most FPS games) and are not that hard to get. Same goes with achievements, most of which are progress related or simply obtainable by getting a certain perk. The characters are very well designed, e.g. Deatshead makes an impression of a real sick mind, striving for power, and through the cutscenes you can almost see why so many people fear him.\n\nMinor flaw of the entire production is the level of difficulty. Personally I think that the hardest difficulty is relatively easy, and for an experienced player finishing Wolfenstein on UBER is not that big of a challenge. Also I can admit that lower difficulties are designed well to fit the casuals that don't want to challenge themselves, but to enjoy this amazing plot.\n\nLast but not least, let's talk about collectibles. Some of them are quite hard to find, but that only makes finding them more satisfying. Moreover, the Enigma Code puzzles are cool addition to the game, and allow us to unlock bonus game modes.\n\nTo summarize - I really enjoyed every minute of the gameplay, and I think the game is worth every penny.

Add some nice level design, multitude of weapons, a lot of gore and a lengthy campaign, and you have an awesome game that is very easy to recommend for fans of the genre.\n\nA good comparison to make here is with the new Shadow Warrior: it takes the gameplay to new directions while it does not forget it roots. For this reason, I wouldn't call the New Order an old-school FPS but thankfully, it is FAR away from the typical, dumbed-down modern shooter.\n\nI have only three gripes with the game:\n\n- I hope it won't come in a DLC or something but when you establish a really twisted boss throughout the game (and I'm not talking about Totenkopf), it is downright painful to see that character (though not unscratched) get away .\n\n- While the levels are varied enough, there were some opportunities that the developers missed out on especially if we look at how over-the-top the game is. For example, if you put us on the Moon, have some nice fights on the surface with low gravity or something! (Instead of just shooting down three drones over the course of 2 minutes...)\n\n- The game presents two timelines that are essentially two playthroughs, however the differences are just too small to bother. Sure, it is worth is because of the gunplay, but it would have been nice if at least some of the scenes are different. (Apart from meeting another side-character and getting another type of collectible, it is pretty much the same. Wyatt and Fergus even say some of the same lines, like how both are mad at you for making the wrong choice.)\n\nBut these are just very small concerns for an otherwise fantastic game.\n\nWhile I am a bit hesitant recommending it at €50, I got it during the Steam Sale for half its price, and I must say it was very, very worth it.\n\nP.S.: I can't stress enough how satisfying the shooting is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhantomStones/recommended/201810/","PhantomStones","Saladofstones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhantomStones/","1246 products in account","Wolfenstein: New Order is a very weird game to examine from a narrative stand point.\n\nPrior to the game's releases, the dev's emphasized the bizarre campiness, with the nazi moon base, the nazified versions of pop culture classics, and the general speculative nature of the setting.\n\nWhen I played it, it seemed like this was how it was going. I'm riding in some sort of super B-17/cargo plan hybrid in 1946 fighting off jets, land and fight off robo dogs, and then have to stop a giant mecha. I meet some stock characters, who are likable, and the gameplay is oddly open.\n\nThen we get to the end of this first act and instead I expierenced one of the most gut wrenching scenes in a game that honestly left me feeling awful, and what follows next is a sequence where an almost braindead BJ reflects on his life and helplessly watches the world change around him.\n\nThe game does a good job with establishing pathos. Nazis are evil, so here they act evil, but they also do a good job of adding human elements. The main antagonist, aside from Deathshead, is shown having a loving, if rather sleazy, relationship with a younger man but it seems rather earnest. I had this weird feeling about this woman, who basically forced me to pick cards to determine my idealogical background, who is also a normal person with a relationship.\n\nYour staff of allies are also well developed, Max Hass could have, especially, been a character to make my eyes roll but I got a feeling of earnest care for the character for the game. He has no understanding of the world, and the closest thing he has to a father was once a hardcore nazi who backpedeled once he realized what he was doing. The character dynamics are subtle and engaging.\n\nThe world itself has a lot of thought put into it. Its certainly not realistic, but it captures the Philip K. ♥♥♥♥ style of a believable fantasy world. There's a sense that this world has aged, even though its new, and that there is a lot of history.\n\nThere is also a prison camp scene, and I was worried here. The holocaust is something that has never been touched upon really in gaming, and I was worried that the game's tonal shifts would end up creating a farce but it did a good job. Its a case where I can say it ending with you piloting a nazi mech blasting apart the camp feels appropiate since the entire level is building up to that point. You get the feeling of having to carefully plan and move your way around, and there is this omnipresence of the regime.\n\nAnd the ending itself is special because it does a good of fleshing out the series' longest lasting Villian, Deathshead. Far from the stoic figure he was in previous games, known for his snark, he is a much more jovial figure. I think the game should have emphasized what the logs only touch upon, that after his near-death in Wolfenstein (2009) he found a new love for life, that he is unhinged in a very different way. He, in own way, views himself as a creator, someone who has used his abilities for the betterment of humanity. And then casts Blaskowitz as the villian in his story, a relic of an old world that can only destroy but cannot create. The line, "When the end comes, we will be judged by what we have made, not what we have destroyed"\n\nNot saying that Deathshead is right, but I had a moment where this over the top character suddenly felt human. He felt like someone with a backstory, a goal, and a motive. And he wasn't wrong, at many times BJ acknowledges that there is a futility to him now and I think the ending of the game is fitting. As much as he wants to just live in peace, he isn't a man who can ever return to that. It gives him a sense of weariness and sadness. The final scene, especially, was poignant since both Deathshead and BJ are ultimately dieing on their own terms, both feeling that their lifes work is done.\n\nThe gameplay itself is solid, the guns have both weight to them and are just fun. You can dual wield assault rifles with under-barrel rocket launchers, use a shotgun that fires bouncing slugs, and use knives or sneaky kills. Its nothing super innovative, but its solid.\n\nThe levels aren't open world, but they are closer to RTCW's level design where its open maps with multiple passageways. You can try to be sneaky, go loud, or mess around.\n\nI did feel that the laser-cutter was underused. Being able to cut open fences to open alternate routes was okay, and opening vents/crates was fun, but it felt like more elaborate uses for it could be made. There are some chains in the middle part of the game that can be cut, either to drop items on nazi heads or, again, open alternate routes. I think having levels where you could have more elaborate uses, like knocking down towers, cutting the ground underneath nazis, or just doing silly things with it could have helped.\n\nThe game has no multiplayer, which in of itself isn't a bad thing, but enemy territories was an amazing expierence and I feel that there sould be an attempt to revive it. With the new tools and setting, the map design could allow for a much more dynamic expierence while remaining true to the objective based gameplay.\n\nUltimately, if you like wolfenstein games, you'll like this. For standard fans of WWII games, the game is more centered on resistence fighting rather than large set pieces. You always are the underdog, as odd as that may seem considering your arsenal. Alternate History fans will enjoy the detail placed in the setting, they fully realized this verse and used both the classic "what if" like nazi moon bases, but also more subtle references to type of architecture and philosophy the Nazi party wanted society to follow.","January 17, 2015","true","26.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm not totally sure how I feel about it overall. I feel pretty neutral about it tbh.\nThe tone of the game kept wanting to be, I believe, quite a lot like a Quentin Tarantino movie, but that tone was frequently overshadowed by how serious and grim it was overall. Not enough campiness in my opinion, and not often enough during gameplay, where all the personality often gets thrown out the window in light of worrying about health and armor. The cutscenes and gameplay were way too divorced. The marketing for the game was where the cool factor lived the most, sadly.\n\nAnyway.... the overall difficulty of the game is reasonable, but overall felt too easy, even on 'I am Death Incarnate', and apparently on 'Uber', too. However, if you didn't play a battle decisively, then the game became incredibly tough for that section, especially in the minor spoiler: Train level, where the game introduces you to the SuperSoldaten, and then an entire squad of them all at once.\n\nI'm glad to have played the game though, and it was fun to experiment with the stealth (It is incredibly forgiving, hilariously so when guards constantly mutter suspciously but otherwise raise no alarm or break from their patrol) and then throw the shackles of stealth off, eat 100+ Overcharged HP (health that drains because it is over your maximum) and run a train on fools with dual-wielded shotguns.\nIt was a parade of gore and blood.","January 4, 2015","true","15.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But were they true?\n\nHELL YES! I enjoyed the game from the first moment to the last, the plot is really well written, and even a person who haven't played its predecessors will quickly find himself in the world of Wolfenstein. Playability of this game is through the roof - you can almost feel the joy of killing every damn Nazi (maybe I'm just a sick person). Graphical side of the game is generally satisfying.\n\nThe controls are very responsive and after a few hours of play you already feel like an MLG pro. Perks are cool addition (they are kinda standard in most FPS games) and are not that hard to get. Same goes with achievements, most of which are progress related or simply obtainable by getting a certain perk. The characters are very well designed, e.g. Deatshead makes an impression of a real sick mind, striving for power, and through the cutscenes you can almost see why so many people fear him.\n\nMinor flaw of the entire production is the level of difficulty. Personally I think that the hardest difficulty is relatively easy, and for an experienced player finishing Wolfenstein on UBER is not that big of a challenge. Also I can admit that lower difficulties are designed well to fit the casuals that don't want to challenge themselves, but to enjoy this amazing plot.\n\nLast but not least, let's talk about collectibles. Some of them are quite hard to find, but that only makes finding them more satisfying. Moreover, the Enigma Code puzzles are cool addition to the game, and allow us to unlock bonus game modes.\n\nTo summarize - I really enjoyed every minute of the gameplay, and I think the game is worth every penny. I'd recommend it to everyone 10/10\n\nPros:\nWell written plot\nPlayability\nGood character design\nAchievements and collectibles\nOveral fun of playingCons:\nLack of a really challenging difficulty level","January 28, 2015","true","36.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

When every other game at the time was falling short of what it intended to be this game came out and became a shining light for the gaming industry, not because it was a great First Person Shooter (which it was) but because they also integrated a story that was well paced and structured something that many video games fail to do. Although the start of the game is badly done and boring (My god how did that get in the game) it quickly changes and becomes the game I hoped it was, the game that I was waiting for in 2014 that wasn't a dissapointing reck at launch. This is one of the best FPS since Half life 2, it broke the formula that many FPS games have been following for years and gave us something worth while. They went beyond the likes of COD and battlefield and put effort into their story and characters, they made a world that felt real even though it was alternative history. This is my favourite game of last year and the best FPS we've gotten in a long time, do yourself a favour and buy this game.","March 14, 2015","true","15.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

First playthrough took me about 17 hours so all that saved development counts! I don't know if I'd classify it exactly as old-school but it's not the usual modern TV toybox stuff either.\n\nTo abuse game comparisons once again, the shooting bits remind me of the Metro games or perhaps the first F.E.A.R.? No slow motion and bullets are lethal, limbs explode and concrete shreds off the walls. Gunplay never got stale through the game and there's plenty of common troopers for satisfying cannon fodder and more tricky enemies who can withstand a beating. There's a lean from cover-function but thankfully it doesn't make the game a wallhugging cover shooter. You're free to do it your way, dualwield big guns and go in badass macho or you can pick off key enemies with stealth (just don't expect to completely ghost the game, stealth is just an initiator here).\n\nThere isn't a talent/xp tree in the usual style but you can unlock new traits (mostly small passive bonuses like clip size) by performing certain feats in combat, like "kill 20 guys with thrown knives". Most guns also get upgrades which change how they work just enough so you don't get bored with them.\n\nStory- and settingwise it felt like Dishonored, in that there's a good variety in level design and setpieces, lots of small details and hidden lore, plenty of NPC characters and nice voice acting. Not all the characters speak universal english and most nazi banter is german with subtitles, which was a nice touch. I even enjoyed the story! I know, plot in a Wolfenstein game right? Don't worry, even the characters acknowledge that usually your mission is just "kill all nazis". At times it crosses over from epic to stupidity if you think about it too hard, whoever designed these super secret nazi facilities didn't really have security covered.\n\nThis is mostly a gung-ho sci-fi action movie (with some grimdark bits in case you forgot that comic book nazis are absolute evil) and it is what I wanted Iron Sky to be, so I'm very satisfied. When it drops to around 10-15 eurobucks in a sale, definitely go for it.","July 2, 2014","true","36.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's absolutely amazing. This is the most fun I've had with a shooter since Bulletstorm.\n\nI didn't expect the story to be interesting, but it is, mostly because the characters are well developed. You get a better feel for the resistance in the interludes, where you explore the underground base. These serve as a welcome break from the action, but also give more exposure to the characters.\n\nThis is no regular corridor shooter. Most levels have secret routes and sometimes there are multiple paths to take. The game offers a chance to approach a situation with stealth or guns blazing, but why not use both? For instance it's great fun to take out the commanders silently first (who can call for backup), then finish up with mayhem from your dual shotguns.\n\nThe arsenal isn't too big, but that's a good thing. Every weapon is fun to use (silenced pistol headshots hnnghh), with dual wielding and secondary fire modes adding variety to the combat. Some enemies are a bit too bullet-spongey when you use regular weapons, but that's a minor complaint. When you make full use of your arsenal, the encounters feel very satisfying.\n\nIf Wolfenstein: The New Order is what we get when developers ditch mp in favor of the campaign, I'm all for it. The focus shows, and I'm actually itching to go back in and replay the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mees462/recommended/201810/","mees462","Lambda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mees462/","523 products in account","Remember how shooters used to be about, you know, shooting stuff? I know, it's a ridiculous notion in this day and age, but really, it used to be! Games like Quake, Doom and the orgiginal F.E.A.R., although they might have had some things at the side, were games like that: Focused on fast-paced, tense action where you were a totall badass and blew things up. Another series from that list is the grandfather of all shooters; Wolfenstein. Now Wolfenstein is back, and with it a shooter about shooting.\n\nFirst off, let me start of with what it does besides shooting - it's better to get the worst out of the way. There is a story. One with lots of cutscenes. One that doesn't offer too much choice (though there is a little bit of choice involved). It's not a bad story - not at all, even - but sometimes it takes itself a little too seriously, even with the subject matter being treated here, and it's definitely not a great story either. It's solid, does its job, but it might be a bit out of place in a Wolfenstein game.\n\nThe best thing about the story is the world: An alternative 1960 where Germany won the second world war by using technology stolen from ancient civilizations. It's a bit far fetched, but the world created is extremely interesting: Massive concrete buildings, oppression... It's a dystopian sci-fi fan's dream, really. The enemy, the Nazi's Reich, is portrayed very efficiently: Brutal, inconsiderate, powerful.\n\nOut of this world goodness streams the action. What kind of action? Action with alternate-reality guns. Assault rifles that blow heads off. Shotguns that blow heads off. Really, a bunch of weapons that blow heads (and other limbs) off. Each weapon is an absolute blast to use; they have just enough recoil and the sounds are utterly fantastic. Besides the fact that every weapon can be dual-wielded (even snipers, which is fun), they also have an alternate fire mode that can change the way the gun works entirely. From the rocket launcher on the assault rifle to the laser rifle on the sniper, there's plenty of variation when it concerns weapons.\n\nOne of the centerpiece weapons of the game (think Half-Life 2's gravity gun, if a lot less majestic and fun, but then again, who can top the gravity gun?) is the Laserkraftwerk. The first thing you might think is, if there would be a German laser gun, it would indeed bear that name. The second you might think is what it is, anyway? Well, it introduces some interesting mechanics when it comes to cutting through walls, fences and the like. It's a bit gimmicky, but stands out enough to be mentioned.\n\nOh, and its secondary fire is a railgun. Just saying.\n\nSo, all in all, what does Wolfenstein: The New Order offer? It offers a shooter. A damn fine shooter, even, that took me 12 hours to complete and had me giggling like a madman the whole way, at least when I got to shoot stuff. When I didn't, the story did keep me interested, but the action is where it's at, and because of that I can't recommend it enough.\n\nBuy this. It's the finest shooter to release in years.\n\nP.S.: Dual wielding snipers! Just think of the utter overkill! Doesn't it make your mouth water?!","June 21, 2014","true","12.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Parts of W:TNO carries over some of the better things about older shooters such as no weapon limits, exploration and challenging enemies in a variety of locations. The shooting is extremely responsive and feels very enjoyable, i found myself thinking "that felt really good to pull off" more than a few times.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game looks good when maxed out, it's not anything super out of this world but the game looks good and there is a good amount of detail in some of the areas in the game, but otherwise the graphics do the job they need to and not much else needs to be said really.\n\nStory:\nIn terms of the narrative, you can relate to most of the NPCs, and the humanity (or inhumanity) of the present characters makes it really easy to feel something in relation to the game world portrayed here. I found myself liking the characters a lot, but the lengths at which you get to discover or learn about the other characters is pretty limited, which is unfortunate because i really liked what back story or lore there was to the characters in this world a lot and felt like it could have been much further explored.\n\nSound Design:\nThe weapons sound great, the voice acting is very well performed, and the original score to the game does a good job at accompanying the other games elements emphasizing the great work put into the other aspects of the game.\n\nMiscellaneous Information:\nThe game does a good job in terms of pacing, it starts off slow and teaches you the limits to the things that make this shooter different from other shooters, such as the sprint jumping mechanic, the exploration and the narrative driven action.\n\nProblem Areas:\nThe only issues with the game in my opinion is that there are a few frustrating areas of the game where I had to turn the difficulty down from the second hardest setting in order to progress where i tried at least 10 times to get past, this is mostly due to poor level design in some areas. The bridge was a notoriously frustrating level and i found myself not having fun. The weapon and item pickups might get on some peoples nerves, having to press a button to pick up each instance of ammo or health but due to the overcharge mechanic i kind of like for health pickups specifically i can choose to get them now or save them for later, but the ammo pickups not being automatic is pretty tedious considering how you can't often afford to skip the ammo pickups at all on harder difficulties.\n\nScore:\nOverall the game does a great job at filling my desire for a good shooter with a decent narrative. The action is as good as  I can recall in recent years and for that alone it earns high marks. That said, the other areas of the game are good or great but not particularly revolutionary or showing quite the same level of detail or mastery as other games with bigger budgets or more resources. I would have really liked to know more about the Nazi controlled alternate history and am disappointed that I did not. There was also lots more room to expand on character lore or other story areas but at least what is here was well executed and sufficient on its own, if feeling a bit minimal.\n\nThe game is a solid 8 out of 10 for shooter fans, and should appeal to anyone looking to explore cool alternate history stories, or for anyone who wants to just see what its like to walk around the moon with Nazis.","May 26, 2015","true","14.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/201810/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","Wolfenstein is back.  After the very disappointing 2009 game I thought the series was done for.  Not only did Bethesda bring it back in style, they showed the world how to make a modern oldschool FPS.  The New Order is fast, over the top, lengthy, and oozes style.\n\nThe New Order takes place in an alternate history where the Nazis won WWII.  It has a retro-futuristic vibe with some very advanced technology, but still styled after the time period.  While it is highly implausable, it's a very interesting world to explore and there are lots of newspaper stories scattered throughout the game you can read to learn more about it.  They even went and recorded German versions of classic music to fit in with the alternate history timeline.\n\nThe game plays like an amalgamation of the best parts of classic and moderns games, combining fast satisfying gunplay, clever and interesting level design, quality graphics, great story and voice acting, and a long campaign.  You can duel wield shotguns and rocker launchers to fight giant mechanical dogs.  You can even sneak around stealthily and silently stab enemies with your knife.  After all the carnage is done, you still get a great story and voice acting.\n\nTwo things I greatly enjoyed about the game that I'd like to point out are the health system which is a hybrid regenerating / non-regenerating health system.  Your health only regenerates up to the next increment of 20 and you have to find health packs to heal any more.  This helps avoid the modern game design trap of having to duck behind cover constantly to regenerate health while also avoiding the oldschool game design trap of finding yourself helpless if you take too much damage.  The other element I wanted to point out is the almost complete lack of quicktime events (I believe there are two in the whole game.)  At least one developer realizes how terrible they are.\n\nThe only drawback I found with the game is the difficulty.  Even on Über difficulty the majority of enemies don't hit very hard and there are tons of health packs around.  The only really dangerous ones are the heavily-armored shotgun-wielding troopers because they have ricocheting ammunition that's nearly impossible to avoid.  There are a few special unlockable game modes however, some of which will offer a larger challenge for those who want it.\n\nThe other issue which may concern some people is that this game runs on the id Tech 5 engine, and hence is very prone to texture popping.  The textures are much higher quality than in RAGE however so don't expect a big blur of compression artifacts when looking at objects up close.  I also experienced pretty serious stuttering if I dropped below 60 fps but it wasn't too difficult to keep the game at 60 on my system.\n\nI heartily recommend Wolfenstein The New Order.  It's the most fun I've had with an FPS in quite some time and well worth playing.  I hope it serves as an example to other developers and publishers on how to make an FPS.","September 28, 2014","true","17.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Taking place in an alternate timeline World War II New Order tells a dark and brooding tale about survival and resistance against impossible odds as you take the role of legendary hero BJ Blazkowicz. What really makes this game shine is it's attention to detail, fantastic cinematic storytelling, and deep characters that feel almost alive. New Order also features great gunplay, a variety of enemies, and superb graphics that all come together to make one hell of a package.\n\nPROS:\n+ Has Characters you actually care about.\n+ Fantastic graphics.\n+ Well written, gripping and emotional story.\n+ Suprisingly decent enemy AI\n+ Amazingly detailed & Varied environments.\n+ You get to kill Nazis, duh.\n\nCONS:\n- Singleplayer only\n- May be offensive to Nazis, Feminists, and Angry bald men.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nCall of Duty gets wet dreams wishing it could be this good. It has an amazing story, great setpieces, and three-dimensional characters. What more do you want in an FPS game?

There are serious bugs with this game that still aren't fixed. You can fix the crashing problem by running the game in (A) Win7 compatibility mode, (B) run as an administrator, and by (C) changing the launch .exe name from "WolfNewOrder_x64" to "WolfNewOrder_x32" in the \Steam\SteamApps\common\Wolfenstein.The.New.Order\ directory.

The game's graphics may be a little outdated, but don't let that ruin your day. Like I always say, buying a game for it's graphics is like watching porn for the storyline. It's pointless, because the gameplay (Sex scenes) is what makes the game (movie).\n\nThese are the things I enjoy about Wolfenstein: The New Order:\n-Options in certain areas that allow you to go in "Rambo" style, or stealthy.\n-Arsenal of weapons can be very fun to use (Especially dual-wielding shotguns)\n-Gameplay with a good storyline (Depending on which one you choose).\n-Melee attacks that are both brutal and enjoyable.\n-Pretty much everything that the game has to offer!!!\n\nThings that I wish Wolfenstein: TNO would have done:\n-Multiplayer or Coop Options.\n-Modding support (But it is Bethesda, so I shouldn't expect something like that from them).\n-More updated graphics and crash fixes.\n\nIt seems like after they shipped out Wolfenstein: TNO, they kinda just gave up on it. Then again, all work is being put into the new DOOM game, which I'm extremely excited about! But overall, Wolfenstein was a very fun experience. The game was fairly easy and fairly hard at times, but it is a great game nonetheless.\n\nOverall, I give the game a 9/10. I'm not being a sheep along with the reviews, but I truly believe this game deserves a 9/10. Despite the lack of multiplayer, I believe Wolfenstein holds it's own with the single player alone. Maybe an update in the future that would allow multiplayer and modding tools would be nice, but very unlikely.","July 20, 2014","true","20.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

In order for me to give you a in depth review I must spoil a few things but note this will not spoil the entire game for you.\nWhere to begin words really can not describe how much I love this game, But I will try for you all.\n\n1 Originality Factor:  Machine games has done a great job keeping it old school just like the old Wolfenstein we all know & love whilst also adding in some new age style to it as well with a new perks system this game really feels like a old school shooter from the 90's.\n\n2 Game Play & Mechanics: There are two different ways to play this game through most of it. You can run & gun all day long make lots of noise with HUGE! guns & let mayhem & carnage reign supreme or you can take the semi new addition stealth sneak up behind the enemy kill the commander before he has time to call in Reinforcements The stealth element is surprisingly well done and the kills are extremely satisfying. (Much better then metro last lights stealth elements) The game allows you to chose which play style you like. Mechanics wise there are perks that can be unlocked to provide bonuses, such as faster reloads and greater magazine capacity etc. The perks can be useful but aren't really needed in this game.\n\n3 Artificial Intelligence: The AI is no dummy in this game a single gun shot or the wrong step or noise can set off a alarm screwing your entire stealthy tatics not to mention if they hear a dog attack they know you're there & if you're playing run & gun you'll find yourself restarting a little more then anticipated because they will actually go looking for you if they know you're there once a alarm has been tripped they are on alert. It's not the best AI I've ever seen but machine games did a very good job at making the game difficult but enjoyable.\n\n4 In Game Options:  The in game visual options are sadly a tad bit lacking with only a few options these would be Graphics Quality, VT Cache Size, VT Compress, MAX PPF, Shadow Resolution, Deapth Of Field which can't be turned entirely off, Screen Spaced Reflection, Additional Quality Settings & Haze Flare & A FOV slider, Very simple but they get the job done. You can't bind 1 key to lean left or right which is sad but you do get a toggle lean which allows you to look up & over down & about or left & right it takes some getting used tro but it's not actually that bad. The rest is very simple key bindings resolution & sadly no audio controls except for master volume it would have been nice to be able to force the game to run in surrounf instead of what windows runs default but hey again it gets the job done & it's nothing that really effects game play.\n\n5 Stealth:  Now for some this is a touchy subject many people have said "It looks like metro last lights stealth" well yes & no its no splinter cell or thief game, But you can't just kill somebody right in front of another AI enemy whilst their back is turned because if the two enemies are cloes together or within their peripheral vision they will notice it so stealth is a bit touchy in this game but it does a great job with it. It's actually pretty hard to do stealth on uber mode & it does a much better job then metro last lights stealth elements.\n\n6 Weapons:  Everything from Unreal Tournament's flak cannon to underslung rockets on your assault rifles this games gun play is beyond satisfying dual wielding Unreal Tournament's flak cannons? HELL YES!!!! the guns are loud, proud & HUGE! just like you would expect in a 1990's shooter. Weapon upgrades can be found throughout the game's levels & each one of them offering something fun.\n\n7 The World & It's Story: Visually this game surprised me the graphics of the world are compelling & lots of atmosphere especially the moon level visually again the textures are very good I don't think I have seen a single texture over used all be it not the best graphics but definitely better then a lot of games these days. Trapped in a vegetative state for 14 years, Wolfenstein hero B.J. Blazkowicz awakens to a 1960 dominated by Nazis and a life no-longer solely defined by the killing of them. A alternate history reality where nazis won world war 2. The story is very compelling & it gets you hooked in imediately especially if you're a scifi nut and/or history nut I don't want to ruin much but the ending is sad.\n\n8 The Characters & BJ's Relationshhips With Them: I can't help but feel drawn into the world of wolfenstein the new order because of the way the characters react to you & what's going on around them there is just a lot of emotion between you & all the others lots of sadness lots of love lots of hatred & anger. New characters introduced just in time to die tragically, old war buddies now confined to wheelchairs, a ragtag band of misfits overcoming adversity and making a stand. You get to see a side of BJ as well  filled with remorse over an early-game choice. During slower moments to his innermost thoughts reflections on childhood traumas and dreams for the future. & if you sit & listen in stealth mode for a bit the nazis will have convos about real world issues they actually have a personality. I can't help but feel drawn into the world of wolfenstein the new order.\n\nMy rating 10 out of 10 keyboards. Should you buy this game? YES! Because it is that damn good.\n\nP.S If this is the last wolfenstein game ever made this by far was a great send off to the entire series Good bye BJ I will miss you.","May 22, 2014","true","21.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

If you still enjoy single-player shooters in the year of our Lord 2014, this is absolutely worth your time.  It's really nicely varied, with just a few dud levels.  Most levels have a great blend of sneaking around (if you're so inclined) and picking off commanders (which has gameplay consequences) until you ♥♥♥♥ everything up and the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan.  Then you're running between pieces of cover, gunning down scores of enemies, switching between weapons for different enemies...it all looks and feels just right.\n\nThe big surprise is that the introspective moments are, well, 1) there at all.  Introspection in a Wolfenstein game?  And 2) handled really well.  It's a ludicrous game - I killed 815 Nazis across the campaign, escaping death in cutscenes about 30 times - but the human moments they included actually work pretty well.\n\nWolfenstein feels both fresh AND nostalgic for the "run around and kill a zillion nazis" gameplay of the original.  I'm not sure how the ex-Starbreeze guys pulled that off in a Wolfenstein game of all things, but the end result is fantastic.  I cannot wait to see their next game.\n\nHaving said that, it will be on cell phones with a million microtransactions.\n\n\n\n*There are some genuinely gruesome moments, many involving torture, so be warned.*","May 29, 2014","true","14.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I had almost no fun playing this one.\n\nPROS:\n\n- A cool premise for continuing the franchise.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Abyssmal level designs throughout. Run through corridors until you get to an open area, usually circular and repeat. There are only a couple of exceptions to this layout, one being a destroyed train amidst the rubble of a bridge which is actually the only level I semi-enjoyed.\n\n- You go to the moon to fight Nazi's, super cool idea, but you only get to play on the actual moon for a minute and then you only have a few flying drones you can take down and then you're back into another corridor.\n\n- Not one but two horrible sex scenes that are so out of place, they're ridiculous. Did this game really need that? Nope. It cheapens the series.\n\n-Tries too hard to be "deep" BJ's ramblings made me want the Nazi's to win\n\n- Missed opportunities. The moment you're going to town in a mech suit is cool but you're in a confined space and it's over as soon as it begins.\n\n- Tedious one man submarine sequence. It felt tacked on as did all the underwater stuff.\n\n- Scavenger hunts. I understand in a FPS wanting to slow things down but at least it can be a fun diversion. I would have rather had the option to play with crayons and draw something in dum-dum's room than to look for crap for all these lazy NPC's.\n\nAt the end of the day, this game is, for me anyway, a HUGE disappointment because it does nothing exceptional or outstanding and doesn't introduce anything really new or interesting into the genre or franchise. There are some cool ideas but they're squandered aimlessly and, at the end of it all, there's just nothing memorable or even good about it.\n\n4 out of 10\n","December 31, 2014","false","21.1"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","5"

It adheres to the principle of "more guns > fewer guns" so you really just shoot stuff in a variety of over-the-top situations. Maybe I make it sound boring, but the story and solid game mechanics keep it interesting the entire way through- I've seen some reviews bashing it for decidedly old-fashioned design choices like health pickups, but that's what really does make it a Wolfenstein game.\n\nI strongly recommend this game, but be aware that the download is massive (40+ Gb) and it's fairly resource-intensive. It has some serious issues on AMD cards, but can be fixed with some simple tweaks avaliable on PCGW. Don't buy this game if you want to run it flawlessly on a medium-end system without doing some research first.

I killed 841 Nazis in one playthrough.\n\nThe graphics are very detailed, which is excellent for conveying the fidelity of your Nazi stabbing, shooting, dismembering, etc.  The story is a little incoherent, but I think they were going for that, and anyway the only story that matters is here's an army of Nazis we need them not alive anymore, you in?  The level design is rather refreshing, as lately shooters have trained me to only move straight down one particular hallway to a specific goal.  Wolfenstein has plenty of hallways - and they're all full of Nazis in need of immediate decimation - but there's plenty of other areas with more open maps, multiple paths of approach, stealth vs. loud, and so on.  If you have a preferred method of exacting fantasy revenge on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 20th century regime (i.e. Nazis) it's in here for you. The upgrade system is well done, as perks unlock due to specific achievements in Nazi-killing prowess, thus rewarding you in 10-25% upgrades in Nazi-disembowling efficiency.\n\nLooking forward to Wolfentein: The Old Blood.  This game definitely needed a prequel, as I don't feel like I've really exacted the totality of my fantasy revenge on the Nazis just yet.

Veterans to stealth may find the skulking about to be a bit easy though. Veterans to this brand of shooters will find a fair challenge. I say this after playing the first time on the "I am Death Incarnate" difficulty and I make a habit of slaughtering UT2K4 godlike bots.\n\nThe story was leaps and bounds above standard. BJ is a complex and dynamic character as are many of his co-stars.  Blew my mind! And while it keeps the traditional Wolfenstein wackiness, the writing makes an incredible amount of sense.\n\nThe only bad thing I have to say about the game is that the context-based cover system can be finicky.

The New Order is all you've heard it to be - action is fun, has decent pacing with pauses for you to catch your breath and the art style is very befitting. Some people complain from the pre-baked shadows, though ironically the texture-heavy id tech 5 engine gives you flashbacks to the graphical aesthetics of Return to castle of Wolfenstein. So even the graphical flaws work in this title's favor.\n\n"Could have been a little more like this, could have used a smidgen more of that" - you know what, do you get to shoot nazis? Yes. Is it fun? Yeah. There could always be more, there could always be something done a little better. But in the end of the day The New Order gets the job done.\n\nMy biggest complaint? Lack of a Music volume slider.

Because this game is huge.  Apparently the devs do not know what compression is.\n\nThat is my only gripe about Wolfenstein: The New Order.\n\nThe rest of it, dare I say, is fun.  Really fun.  It is a solid FPS and is very welcome in the age of bland FPS games that are poorly written and rip off other artists' graphical styles.  The weapons handle well, kills are satisfying, and you have a health bar, which hearkens back to the old retro FPS games like, well, Wolfenstein.  While some of the things like the slide mechanic and the cover system took some getting used to, they work.  Even though I mainly used the cover system to farm kills for the weapon upgrades you get from killing enemies from cover.\n\nThe stealth mechanic works too, nowhere near as good as something like Metal Gear, but I like to think that the Nazi AI is intentionally stupid to show how complacent they have become after their victory.  Which leads me to another point.\n\nThe Worldbuilding.\n\nIt's great.  You can tell that there has been some serious effort put into the worldbuilding of this game.  From the diary entries of one of the main character's cousins after the victory, to just looking around and seeing how different this world looks, it is all very well done.  In the fascist-industrialist way, the Nazis have built and rebuilt massive cities over oceans of concrete.  Propaganda speakers spout information about the greatness of National Socalism along with the weather report.  The military has a retro futuristic look along the lines of Fallout.  Giant robots with lasers, troops in power armor, laser weapons.  It's all ♥♥♥♥in' great.  Hell, even The Beatles songs are in German.\n\nThis is a solid game with solid worldbuilding and fantastic gameplay.  Definitely get it if it's on sale.","March 5, 2015","true","24.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/201810/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","What is it?Wolfenstein: The New Order isl a full-on action first-person shooter.  The backdrop of the game is post WWII era starting around 1946 and ending up in the 1960s, where an alternative outcome was a Nazi victory.  It's all a little bit silly and overdone, but the game never really takes itself too seriously...\n\nGameplayThe game has an incredible array of weaponry and next to no realism whatsoever - making it a lot of fun!  Yes, you can somehow carry with ease an arsenal of weaponry that probably wouldn't fit into your garage, but what the heck!  Raw FPS action with a story and characters that matter too.  For the most part, ammo is plentiful and you will feel more like a bullet-hose on steroids.  The level of difficulty is strong without ever feeling too impossible and you feel that you accomplished each part of the mission rather than success being an inevitability.\n\nThe good...Players are given choice (stealth is often an option).  Mostly though, you will be in the thick of things laying down a carpet of weapon-fire and it's here the game excels.  It has lots of different set pieces, including under-water, train, submarine and even a short lunar walk.  The story is of course far-fetched and silly but the non-playable characters have personality.  Controls are minimal (yay!), and both keyboard/mouse and controllers are supported (with hot-switching between the two).\n\nDespite (as usual) having to play as white dude with muscles the size of Rambo, this game includes a better mix of characters than many of its ilk, and places women AND disabled people (yes, that's PLURAL disabled people) in equal stature to men in the game.  It's something seen so very rarely and yet no reviews seem to have picked up on it which is a shame - so major kudos is deserved here.\n\n\nThe bad...The graphics are fine but not epic by today's standards and level of detail (especially distance texturing) looks a little more dated than its 2014 date suggests.  You will probably need to force anti-aliasing through your GPU's driver software as the game's graphics settings didn't seem to remove jaggies.  Some cut-scenes are choppy but that seems to be a common-place problem in many games.    Some maps are a little too linear and there are occasional but irritating points of no return.  Likewise, side missions must be completed whenever they become available; do something else, like "sleep" or play the next part of the story, and the side missions are often gone forever (even if the story returns you to the exact same location).\n\nThere are a couple of controller mechanics in the game that are frustrating (the speed-slide being the worst, needing a combination of 2-3 keys/buttons pressed while simulateously controlling direction), and these caused a little unnecessary frustration in a couple of places.  You are unable to save your current position (the game uses checkpoint-saves).\n\n\nAnd the ugly...Pretty much every German-speaking character is a Nazi.  Now, I'm English and that bugs me, but I'm sure if I were German I would be totally offended by that as it does nothing to remove Germany from that hideous black spectre of Nazism.  There is an inexplicable 'concentration camp' mission where it is your role to free all the prisoners but this really seemed to trivialise such a location and I feel it would have been better in a more generic prison or labour camp setting.  'Freeing all the prisoners' from this camp came down to stomping around in a mech suit gunning down Nazis, after which 'ALL the prisoners' were notably just 6 NPCs who were seen to leave, hardly giving the player the feeling of liberation of the masses!   This, and a bit of weird sci-fi 'mystery secret technologies hundreds of years old' weren't the highlights of the story exactly, but it IS fantasy at the end of the day, and fantasy has no 'must be plausible' rule.\n\nConclusionWolfenstein: The New Order is a highly enjoyable FPS with both story and character.  The story might not be uber-realistic, but I don't think it tries to be.  Instead, the player is treated to a feast of weaponry and enemies to use them on.  This is a game that proves it hasn't forgotten where the true fun lay in its spiritual predecessors of 1981 and 1992.  If you enjoy full-on FPS action, then you will enjoy this game.","December 10, 2014","true","130.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

There actually hasn't been many action FPSs to of come out the last year or more, and Wolfenstein is a great return to form. It does a pretty descent job of mixing some old school mechanics, while modernizing it with new school FPS tropes.\n\nThe story and stealth is a little weak, but the gun play, the turret and vehicle segments, and the pacing of the game is top notch, some of the best I've played for a while.\n\nOverall, the game is well worth the asking price, and just a lot of fun shooting the ♥♥♥♥ out of Nazis.\n\nPros:\n- Duel wielding mechanic is fun and balanced\n- Fantastic gun play and pacing\n- Turrets and vehicle segments are actually really fun and not filler!\n- Shoot Nazis\n\nCons:\n- Stealth and story very lack luster\n- Could use more variety in guns","June 18, 2014","true","23.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I love how much effort was put into the singleplayer because the devs concentrated solely on it, leaving out the multiplayer.\nThe story is pretty intriguing (if not too complex) and the length of it is also pretty damn high for a linear game. Took me about 25 hours to complete it on easy difficulty while taking my time to explore the enviroment (which is made up beautifully, every little sign or poster is worth reading).\nThe gameplay itself? True oldschool shooter with no regenerating health, armor, all kinds of dakka, most of which you can dual wield for even more carnage. Blowing limbs off is not uncommon and generally the whole game has that special feel that you rarely see these days if you do at all.\nOf course, there is no oldschool FPS without hidden areas and items, right? That's right, the devs didn't forget about that either. Lots of stuff to discover and find, you can solve puzzles with the stuff gained from exploration (which I did not complete yet, so I can't have an opinion on it).\n\nAll in all, if you loved the FPS games of the past decade, you will really appreciate this one :)\n\nNow get out there and rip 'em a new one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrCrossa/recommended/201810/","MrCrossa","MrCrossa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrCrossa/","340 products in account","I have a lot to say about this game. Mostly good, very few of it bad.\n\nThe game starts off during world war 2, the player taking the role of William "B.J." Blazkowicz. After  being forced to watch one of his comrades die in front of his own eyes,  him and his other comrades blow ♥♥♥♥ up and a shrapnel is lodged into the back on Blazkowicz's brain. He is then put into a coma.\n\nHe is found unconscious, and put into a hospital/home for the mentally/physically disabled. Over the years, nazi officers take pateints to experiment upon. Fast forward to 1960, World War 2 is over. HOWEVER, the US surrendered, and Nazi Germany has won. On the very day he regains control of his body. officers visit said home and shut the place down. He stabs the officer who is about to kill him, makes an escape with the woman who had been taking care of him for the past 14 years, and set out to take down Nazi Germany with the resistance group.\n\nEven though it was released just last year, it gives off the feeling of an old style shooter. And no, I do not mean that in a DNF bad kind of way, it feels properly modernized and doesn't reek of old formulas mixed with new. It feels very solid and satisfying to play. No DLC, no day 1 season pass, no shoe horned in multiplayer, no microtransactions, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just a single player campaign first person shooter. as it should be.\n\nStory felt very solid, makes you feel for the main characters, especially with what happens to some of them. And no, you do NOT need to play the older Wolfenstein games in order to enjoy it (but you should since Wolfenstein 3D is pretty good even if it is 20 ish years old at this point.)\n\nHowever, only real complaint I have is it is not very well optimized. Everything is set to low at 1080p, framerate is all over the place, sometimes as low as 18 FPS, and sometimes as high as 60. And on top of that, with that uneven framerate, dialogue/lip movement did unsync and become out of place. If you have a lower end rig, be aware that you might not be able to run it at full capacity unless you do some overclocking or lower the resolution.\n\nAll in all, performance issues aside, it is a very solid single player first person shooter. One of the most satisfying FPS games I've played in years  even if the ending was kind of meh.\n\nAnd I CANNOT wait for The Old Blood to come out.\n\nEDIT THAT PROBABLY NOBODY WILL SEE: And if it's not just a rumor, I cannot wait for that rumored Wolfenstein game set for 2017.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/201810/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account",""While I was gone, they set the world on fire. It wasn't a war anymore; it was a remaking. Some losses are inevitable. Some... unthinkable. Now they've built a new world. Armies of steel and thunder. They're rewriting history. But they forgot about me." - B. J. Blazkowicz, in the trailer\n\nThe New Order had enormous boots to fill with Wolfenstein series. The series has always been the true embodiment of action gaming, basically inventing the first-person shooter (FPS) genre itself.\n\nWhen it got released couple of years ago, I was rather sceptical: an only-single-player story-based FPS of an extremely renowned franchise sounds very hard to pull off. I still bought it full-priced at release, and I was proved pleasantly wrong.\n\nCore of Fire and Steel\nOpening act with the bombers and the all-out attack on the Nazis is one of the coolest I've seen. In the alternate history that is the game's storyline, Nazis have superior technology and the allies have launched a fleet of warplanes to destroy the fortress called Deathshead's Compound. This act would decide who wins the war. There's desperation in the air.\n\nBlazkowicz, still the protagonist from beyond the years, is no longer a spy but a full-blown soldier. However he's depicted not as desperate but determined to end the main antagonist General "Deathshead" Strasse once and for all.\n\nTo do this, there's a large arsenal of weapons. The basic pistols, assault rifles and shotguns are complemented with beam weapons, miniguns and cannons. As Wolfenstein is the epitome of action FPS, everything can be dual-wielded from knives to sniper rifles to grenade launchers with the cost of losing the ability to aim through sights.\n\nRunning and gunning is great. Weapons have oompf and all of them are useful. With five difficulty levels, there's a fitting setting for everybody from laughably easy to challenging. Only a ridiculously unfair difficulty is missing although I'm not exactly missing it.\n\nQuestionable regenerating health has been borrowed from modern FPS games but I think it has been done reasonably: you only regen to the next 20 health instead of to the maximum. Not that it would be much of an issue anyway: there's a bit too much armour, ammo and health lying around even on the highest setting to be called "Über".\n\nThen again, the big armoured robots and special troopers can still kill you in a couple of seconds from full health and armour if you're not careful and take cover. The large amount of equipment also helps in avoiding a situation where you became stuck because of too little health. By the way, there is no manual saving, only predetermined saving spots in each level.\n\nGetting stronger and ninja-er\nBlazkowicz gets "perks" to become more capable by completing various weapon-based challenges. True to this age, many scenes or even full missions can be completed either guns blazing or through stealth and sneaking.\n\nStealth is done rather well for FPS: enemies can see you from far instead of being totally shortsighted, they can see bodies (unfortunately they can't be moved) and raise alarm to call in reinforcements. They obviously hear gunshots. It's just odd that when stealthing, even a single thrown knife to the knee or toe will kill any armoured soldier.\n\nThe integrated blowtorch/laser gun deserves a special mention. Blowtorch is integral to progress in The New Order: it's used to break through wired cages, iron chains and metal panels. The holes you cut will be just like you cut them, a rather cool detail.\n\nOnce upon a time in an alternate history\nActually, I'm having hard time deciding whether the action or the adventure portion of the game has been done better. So great is the story, the dialogue and the setting of the reimagined world.\n\nThe New Order tells many touching and powerful stories within a single game. The atrocities of Nazis are showcased in horrifying fashion. There are all these bits and pieces of intriguing made-up history hidden within the game.\n\nIt's interesting that in the very beginning chapter you're forced to make a decision as to who lives or dies and this plays throughout the game as two separate timelines, with small details like people changing in due course.\n\nThe characters and their destinies are intriguing, well-thought and memorable. That goes both for your allies and the antagonists. Both sexes are involved in both good and evil. The personalities and destinies of your allies are good and relatable and sometimes harsh and intense. There's even a carefree romance thrown into the mix.\n\nOne of the most powerful events is the scene of an old lady furiously yet weakly slapping the face of a Nazi scum responsible for killing their child. I'll remember that a long time, that's how powerful I thought it was.\n\nThe game is littered with instances like this. They are even more obvious after a playthrough or two, when you've got yourself conveniently and painfully attached to the characters.\n\nThe antagonists are especially well done. If you feel genuine hatred, disgust and/or horror for them and time after time that feeling only intensifies, you know they have succeeded as antagonists.\n\nWhile the cruel prison commandant Frau Engel is scary and absolutely despicable person, Deathshead is still an excellent main antagonist. He's shown to be pretty much insane and horrifyingly sadistic person monster. If not at first, at least in the second playthrough I just felt about blasting his smirking face when he first appears behind the bulletproof glass in the first episode.\n\nConclusions\nI claim that The New Order is one of the best FPS shooters of the decade. It looks beautiful, it's technically a masterpiece and it excels in story like no FPS before. It only lacks a multiplayer but frankly, it was probably good that they focused on the awesome single player experience instead of forcing in a generic multiplayer.\n\nThere's a nice amount of replay value. With the two different timelines, I played it 41 hours and about 4 times through before I had found all the collectables, cracked the enigma codes (ultimately with a bit of online help though) and so acquired all achievements. Enigma codes unlock special gameplay modes like god mode and one-life mode, which adds another layer of challenge if one wants it.\n\nUnlike usually with single-player games that I play through 100%, I will probably return to play this again for the story. Consequentially, I would recommend Wolfenstein: The New Order even at full price but since it's 2-year old game you can get it super-cheap at a sale. Economically speaking I suggest you wait for one. Then treat yourself to this sweet.","June 2","true","42.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I liked weapons in this game, and for some reason I have really enjoyed using mouse3 :) Levels were fine, pretty linear, which I don't find bad with games like this. The final boss was pretty easy in my opinion to be honest, I would definitely change that a bit, make it more challenging.  I see that people were complaining about graphics, I didn't have any issues, and i find graphics really nice, especially in cut-scenes.\nalso Wolfenstein: The New Order includes nostalgic Easter Eggs carrying the player back to the first days of 3D first-person gaming.

The game really gets you involved, almost indebted to the characters so that you just want to play more and more.  The story line is great, and I don't think anyone will tell you otherwise.  In all the games I've ever played with campaigns, this one, while not the most grandiose or beautiful, is the most incredible.  I don't want to say anything else; if you like good story telling, this is the game for you.\n\nThe game play is actually pretty good.  The guns and animations handle just like doom 3, which is to be expected because that engine is ID's bread and butter.  This is not a bad thing, in fact the weapons were quite fun to shoot and each carried with them their own set of uses, pros and cons.  The visuals left a lot to be desired, however.  Doom 3 was the bleeding edge for gaming back in the day, and unfortunately Wolfenstein is not on par with what I would expect from such a big budget title.  They used some sort of blurring effects on things that were far away (or even not so far away).  Even with draw distance maxed out, it didn't seem to matter.  This of course could be an issue with my machine, but it was worth mentioning  that I had trouble tuning this issue out.  The game is also locked in a 60 fps, thanks to IDtec9.  I am a strong believer that in this day and age 60 fps should not be something that we as PC gamers need to settle on.  But I digress.  The game itself does not feel repetitive.  You aren't mowing down endless hordes of the same enemies.  As we would expect from ID, there is somewhat of a diversity in baddies, but I felt it could be more exhaustive.  However, this is only because I hold ID to such a standard.  The stealth parts are A+.  Seriously, in most stealth games, if you are spotted then its game over.  If you are sneaking up on an enemy, and you anticipate that he is going to see you, you can sprint up to him and assasinate him before he finishes calling you out and not break your stealth.  Really, this is awesome and stealth games that are in development should take note. In the event that you lose your stealth, its not really that big of a deal.  A sizable number of reinforcements are called in, and when you take care of them, you move on.  Since the gunplay is actually pretty good, you may even find yourself making no attempt to be stealthy just to be able to waste a few more Nazis.\n\nWould I recommend that you pay $60 for this game?  No.  Simply because no game with only a single player mode should carry this value.  Because the weapons are so much fun to shoot, I wish there was a multiplayer option.  Doom 3 did not have an amazing multiplayer, but they at least attempted it.  I am the type of person who doesn't play a game twice, and even though I'm only "44% Complete," I got my enjoyment and I'm ready to move on.  I came here because I played the original Castle Wolfenstein and Doom games on my windows 95 machine as a kid, and I'm happy to see this title on a game of this magnitude.  I hope for more in the future.","June 7, 2014","true","10.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You play as William "B.J." Blazkowicz from previous Wolfenstein games which surprises me on overall character development. Presentation of each character is really great. The ways BJ talked and thought. I could understand his feeling and motive as the story proceeded. Villains also have great setup and personality. Especially, the cutscenes are very polished which create strong telling and sense of presence. The more you play and discovered its details through notes and news, the more you get supporting details of game world. Only end-game part I feel bit rushed and some characters just hop-in and out to nowhere. However, big thanks to writing and top-notch voice acting. These elements push TNO to be one of most memorable storytelling shooting game.\nThe gameplay introduces very solid shooting mechanic. The combination of old school (pick-ups, health system, one man arsenal) and modern gunplay (regeneration, cover system, dual-wield) are well implemented. It keeps game fluid without losing its old school feeling. Perk system is like do challenge and unlock your upgrade which add additional gameplay and player’s motive as you can keep your upgrade for higher difficult (but you have to choose from chapter selection).\n\nFor gun blazing is very fun as each weapon give strong punch and solid sound. You can expect enjoyment and satisfying shooting as you leave the area with gore and remain of your destruction.\n\nStealth is great additional advantage to locate the collectables (Yes, TNO has a lot of collectable even most of them are easy to find) and take out high priority threat.\n\nEnemy A.I. is quite challenging with some noticeable frank strategy, but sometimes they just stand and wait for player which makes higher difficult less challenge.\n\nWhat I love about TNO is timeline based gameplay. Your decision of beginning of the game will effect on your side characters, upgrade, and some pathway. Thanks to map design team that allow player to discover the change and choose their play-style.\n\nWhat can I say about TNO soundtracks? It’s ROCK and match in each area you encounter or cutscene. OST gives strong taste of both story and gameplay.\n\nIdTech 5 engine is also introduced in TNO with MegaTexture technology. It looks beautiful at the distance and well optimized even my desktop does not match with system requirement. However, the engine requires too much system resource and still gives poorly outcome. About 30 GBs of game space are texture files, but the textures are muddy and blurry in close-up and some texture popping issue like RAGE. I’m quite disappointed in this part.\n\nMachineGames has proved themselves is this Wolfenstein. To be honest, TNO doesn't need to have next-gen elements, but it can provide very satisfying experience and superb storytelling in FPS that I haven’t played for a long time. TNO is considered to be one of my favorite single-player shooting and MachineGames now earn my trust for expectation of future quality game.","June 11, 2014","true","39.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drblutengott/recommended/201810/","drblutengott","Dr. Blutengott","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drblutengott/","437 products in account","A hallmark of classic game design. Wolfenstein: The New Order isnt bogged down by modern game mechanics and can stand as a true successor to the original Wolfenstein 3D. If you love classic shooters like Wolfenstein 3D or Half-Life 2, this is probably for you. The dual-weilding/alt-fire mode of the weapons is incredibly enjoyable, and provides a formidable arsenal against the hoards of mecha-future Nazis you will gleefuly gib, splatter, stab, explode and otherwise maim. Howver, I would level that the lazor weapon is relied on too much by the designers as a kill stick for higher calibre enemies, and as a result your traditional stockpile of arms can feel neglected. The game unlike a majority of other moder shooters does not include a multiplayer component, but I never felt anything was lost from a lack of it. Rather the resources that would have gone towards the multiplayer were directed into the single-player campaign. Locations varied as castles, U-boats and even moonbases serve to clearly distinguish the levels, much like an old NES game would.The game also features a plethora of collectibles including Nazi gold, code fragments, diary entries and even records parodying music of the 50s and 60s in a New Regime style to great effect.\nWhile the game does have an abundance of cutscenes, they were never too much of a distraction from the general action of the main story, and provided B.J. a sense of characterization and depth usually unseen in the traditional meat-headed guntoter. Machine Games did an excellent job of creating dispicable Nazi heads you would love to plow through hundreds of their subordinates to eliminate. Sadly the chance to deliver such sweet justice by your hand is denied. The supporting cast is similarly developed well enough to gain your alligiance but is not seen as much. This should stand as a crime: the allied cast simply does not get enough screen time or even backstory to fill my desire to know more about them.\n\n\nOverall Wolfenstein: The New Order comes out as a highly enjoyable FPS romp through a dystopian future-past which will leave your smiling face coated in Nazi blood.","May 27, 2014","true","16.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

The game really gets you involved, almost indebted to the characters so that you just want to play more and more.  The story line is great, and I don't think anyone will tell you otherwise.  In all the games I've ever played with campaigns, this one, while not the most grandiose or beautiful, is the most incredible.  I don't want to say anything else; if you like good story telling, this is the game for you.\n\nThe game play is actually pretty good.  The guns and animations handle just like doom 3, which is to be expected because that engine is ID's bread and butter.  This is not a bad thing, in fact the weapons were quite fun to shoot and each carried with them their own set of uses, pros and cons.  The visuals left a lot to be desired, however.  Doom 3 was the bleeding edge for gaming back in the day, and unfortunately Wolfenstein is not on par with what I would expect from such a big budget title.  They used some sort of blurring effects on things that were far away (or even not so far away).  Even with draw distance maxed out, it didn't seem to matter.  This of course could be an issue with my machine, but it was worth mentioning  that I had trouble tuning this issue out.  The game is also locked in a 60 fps, thanks to IDtec9.  I am a strong believer that in this day and age 60 fps should not be something that we as PC gamers need to settle on.  But I digress.  The game itself does not feel repetitive.  You aren't mowing down endless hordes of the same enemies.  As we would expect from ID, there is somewhat of a diversity in baddies, but I felt it could be more exhaustive.  However, this is only because I hold ID to such a standard.  The stealth parts are A+.  Seriously, in most stealth games, if you are spotted then its game over.  If you are sneaking up on an enemy, and you anticipate that he is going to see you, you can sprint up to him and assasinate him before he finishes calling you out and not break your stealth.  Really, this is awesome and stealth games that are in development should take note. In the event that you lose your stealth, its not really that big of a deal.  A sizable number of reinforcements are called in, and when you take care of them, you move on.  Since the gunplay is actually pretty good, you may even find yourself making no attempt to be stealthy just to be able to waste a few more Nazis.\n\nWould I recommend that you pay $60 for this game?  No.  Simply because no game with only a single player mode should carry this value.  Because the weapons are so much fun to shoot, I wish there was a multiplayer option.  Doom 3 did not have an amazing multiplayer, but they at least attempted it.  I am the type of person who doesn't play a game twice, and even though I'm only "44% Complete," I got my enjoyment and I'm ready to move on.  I came here because I played the original Castle Wolfenstein and Doom games on my windows 95 machine as a kid, and I'm happy to see this title on a game of this magnitude.  I hope for more in the future.","June 7, 2014","true","10.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The story was engaging and ramped at appropriate moments, and the pacing seems to take some inspiration from movies in where the plot gets shoved along in things that wouldn't be as interesting to get to the good parts. The story takes some leaps of faith when doing Tarantino transitions, but honestly they are shorter leaps of faith than what the player had to do in some levels.  It works; Wolfenstein is long without many noticeable lulls and offers a lot of options in each level when it comes to branching paths (some of which are dependant on what you did in the first chapter).\n\nThe writing is pretty good for what I was expecting. Some characters are developed more than others, but for how many people get thrown in the mix there's a decent balance. The scope of what occurs during the game is huge, to say the least.\n\nThe game features some light stealth mechanics that are simple, but work. They are by no means advanced, but they get the job done and allow you to complete objectives without being seen if player agency wills it. The combat itself is solid, and harkens back to the unlimited weapon inventories of Wolfenstein, in which there's less weapons overall, but you're carrying all of them at once. Every weapon can be dual-wielded, with the exception of turret weapons, grenades, and weapons you only possess one of. There's a decent cover system, and all weapons have some alternate function.\n\nThe game features a lot of puzzles or situations featuring the cutting tool, which is a game mechanic to saw through chain link fences and thin metal plates to get into different areas or open some containers. The plates even act as cover against most weapons, except for laser turrets (they chew through them). In a way, it's Wolfenstein's gravity gun. It's interesting to use, and the tool gets upgraded multiple times, even becoming a capable weapon in its own right.\n\nThere's a level of detail regarding the world that is excellent. Everything is controlled by the Nazi regime, even pop culture. The level of technology over the time span was also interesting to see in concert with the totalitarian government control. Poking around and listening to dialog gives a bit of insight into just how twisted the world has become.\n\nThere were some graphical glitches and pop-in textures, but aside from that, there wasn't really anything detrimental to my overall experience with the game. The game was a blast and ended with a bang, faithful to the source material to the end.","May 25, 2014","true","23.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Everything's gone to ♥♥♥♥. The Nazi War machine is advancing at an astonishing rate. We can't catch up, our tactics are failing, outclassed and outgunned, and no-one knows why. People are getting desperate. Not me, I'm here to see an old friend and settle a score.\n\nStory In July 1946, U.S. Special Forces operative William "B.J" Blazkowicz, Fergus Reid and Probst Wyatt take part on a massive raid against the fortress of Deathshead. Which serves as a giant weapon laboratory for the Nazis. The three get captured by Deathshead, and forces Blazkowicz to choose between Fergus or Wyatt. Based on your choice, Fergus or Wyatt die a horrible death. Blazkowicz and the survivor barely escape the compound, but not without injury. Blazkowicz suffers a critical head injury, which brings him into a vegetative state for fourteen years. After he wakes up from his vegetative state, the Nazis have taken over the world.\n\nGameplay Wolfenstein: The New Order has some very fun first person shooting mechanics, making it ever so satisfying to kill waves of Nazis. You can upgrade special skill trees by doing certain tasks, this will allow you to play how you want. You can stealth your way through certain levels, which is surprisingly well done. The game has a lot of different settings, which are all very fun to play through. Based on your choice at the start of the game, Fergus or Wyatt will live throughout the game, which gives the game some replay ability. The game has sixteen chapters, which will take the average gamer around twelve hours to complete. You can carry an unlimited amount of weapons, with some you can even duel-wield. Some weapons are upgradable by finding items, like a grenade launcher to add to your machine gun.\n\nConclusion The surprisingly good B-Movie story and likable cast of characters make Wolfenstein: The New Order really worth playing by this fact alone. The gameplay is also extremely fun, with lots of weapons to shoot some Nazis with. Even the stealth take on the game is a welcome bonus. Most levels are very linear though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaxusvaxu/recommended/201810/","vaxusvaxu","Game Maniac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaxusvaxu/","4351 products in account","As usual, Bethesda never disappoints me, including this game. I feel hard to stop playing the game once indulging myself in its world. Here's my summary below.\n\nGood:\n\n1. graphic visual\n\n2. very sastisfactory sense of shooting\n\n3. very intriguing story and it also has strong emotional impacts.\n\n4. novel perktrees.\n\n5. various silent takedown movements\n\n6. well-hidden objects. You'll probably miss lots of them without these hint marks on the map. And even if you read the map and know there's something around, sometimes it's really challenging to find them, but it's still manageable after hard thinking, and your efforts won't go unrewarded, since these loots are useful and even unique. I even had a sense of achievement once after I successfully find the loots.\n\n7. monologue fits each situation extremely well. It's not like I am playing as some character, but I AM Blaskowicz himself.\n\n8. Very suble tutorial. Unlike some games that just tell you press sth. to do sth, the tutorial is situational based. You will know what I am talking about once you start playing the game.\n\nInsufficient:\n\n1. Too easy combats, even under Uber(hardest), as long as you don't rush into crowd, and  just take out enemies one by one instead.\n\n2. Linear missions and maps, not open world, unsatisfatory sense of exploration. Once you turn in missions related to main story, these side missions are gone.\n\n3. v-sync toggle useless. It's alway 60 FPS for me somehow. It's an FPS and there's a diffreence beween 60 and 120 FPS. Others with good gear might also feel this way.\n\nOthers:\n\nI used to categorized the following into the more insufficient kind, but now I've changed my mind and think it suits the game background well.\n\nSometimes unclear waypoints, and the lack of minimap on HUD also exacerbates the issue. The combination of these two is a real pain for someone who's used to games like Borderlands 2. Relying on your instinct might be more convenient sometimes.\n\nReason:\n\nIn short, it enhances role play experience. Blaskowicz is an American agent trying to infiltrate various German buildings, not a Nazi architect. He's supposed to be somewhat unfamiliar with these interiors, even with the assistance from maps. So it doesn't matter how good his sense of direction is, there isn't any known waypoint in his head except these maps. There's no way for him to immediately know EXACTLY which is where. The rest only relies on his direction instinct (transferred to player's instinct). Some necessary but manageable explorations also strengthen this dangerous and undertermined atmosphere of overall gameplay. Not sure if Bethesda did this on purpose for better role play experience or just omitted this.\n\nThe gold's functionality is still unknown even after my first playthrough. But overall, it's a very decent game and is worth your time and money. Althought it's an FPS game, but keep in mind that stealth is really important, like silent takedown and throwing knives, and direct confrontation often is not your best choice, especially under Uber (hardest). BTW, it's really funny that the greenhorn said "thank you, sir" even if I slapped him in the face. It would be even more funny if he could ♥♥♥♥/piss his pant!

The gun sounds (and all the other sounds for that matter) were very well-engineered. Not only that, but the gibs and blood effects when shooting enemies are incredibly satisfying, something which is apparently very hard to accomplish in modern shooters these days. The game has a few cool Wolfenstein 3D references I've found, and in general, there are lots of nice Easter eggs to find. The game, despite what you may expect from a story that revolves around the Nazis winning WWII, is very funny. It's purposely cheesy throughout with the super-American B.J. Blaskowicz (the same one from the canon Wolfenstein 3D) and it's rad as hell. The developers clearly worked hard and had lots of fun doing so, and although I'm very picky with games, I find that this is an excellent shooter. This is the most fun I've had playing a modern game in years. If you love classic FPS gameplay, this is for you. My one complaint is that I need more.

Then comes the second half. The second half resorts to the game throwing every enemy they can at you. The challenge is definitely needed in today's games, but it completely rids you of a playstyle choice. Enemies no longer can be stealth killed, or manuvered around, so each section gets dumbed down to "1. Use most powerful gun and empty bullets into armored enemy until they are dead. 2. Acquire new enemy. 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until room is cleared. 4. Advance. 5. Repeat entire sequence." This also gets very frustrating as well, as inevitably, you will run out of ammo. At that point, you get killed by some over-armored shotgun spamming Nazi, and have to start over. To summarize the second half, enemies can no longer be stealth killed, or avoided, leading you into bottleneck situations that require you to abandon any tactical essence about the second half, and resort to emptying round after round into seemingly invincible enemies who do the same thing to you, but ten times more effectively. I find myself feeling like completing the game is a chore, and do my best to resist the temptation to go back to the earlier levels, which are infinitely better.\n\nI give this game a 5/10, as the first half is a definite 9, but the last half is a struggling 1.\n\nNot worth the $60 I paid, but maybe a lower price would make this game more appealing to play.","May 24, 2014","true","30.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It’s not radically innovative or revolutionary, but it does so many things to stand out in the current landscape that it doesn’t have to be. A brutal and charming adventure that doesn’t pull any punches but knows when to be light-hearted. The combat design and shooting mechanics (no restricted 2-weapon system, no need to aim-down-sights, multiple ways to approach enemy encounters, glorious hit feedback and gibs) are liberating while being supported by tough AI and fantastic weapons to shoot at them with, in more expansive levels that encourage exploration. Meanwhile, excellent storytelling through fantastic characters and the environment is happening all around you, rather than at you. Also, has one of the best soundtracks in a game with some of the most hard-hitting rock and metal with touches of industrial music that gets your blood pumping to fight for the resistance.\n\nIt brings the best of the old and the new. It’s exactly what people who complain about modern shooters should play, to see it’s not all doom-and-gloom. Personally, it has set a new standard in shooters.

I came into the game expecting it to be a competent, if fairly brainless shooter. It's more than 'competent' though. In fact - I think it might be one of the best games of the year. Given that the game is an over-the-top, Nazi killing simulator, I was expecting the story to be more of an afterthought. Surprisingly though, the game's alternate history story is compelling and the game does a good job with world building by peppering the levels with optional conversations and newspaper clippings that help make the world seem more alive. I was expecting the story to go for camp humor, but the game takes itself very seriously at times and the quality of the writing is such that it doesn't come off like some 12 year old's idea of what's is dark and gritty.\n\nI also admire the game's design philosophy, as it does a good job of combining the better elements of new-school and old-school FPS design. For example, the game's health system is a hybrid between health pickups and regenerating health. The way it works is that you can only regenerate health in blocks of 20. If you were to start with 100 health and then lose 95, you'd only be able to regenerate up to 20. I like this system a lot, since it alleviates some of the 'die and retry' repetition from older shooters, but still encourages you to keep moving instead of just hiding behind a wall while you wait for your health to recharge.\n\nThe levels are well-designed, with lots of large open rooms, secrets and multiple paths. The controls are nice and responsive, and there's a decent selection of weapons with balanced strengths and weaknesses. You can slide into cover, or shoot while sliding. You can also dual-wield almost every single weapon in the game for an increase in rate of fire while sacrificing accuracy. There are situations where you can take out enemies using stealth, or just go in guns blazing. There's also a perk system that levels up organically based on things you do in the game rather than experience (like x number of head shots with the pistol, or stealth kills using throwing knifes).\n\nThe game is just... a lot of fun. There isn't any one thing that makes this game stand out when compared to other shooters, but it does many things very well and manages to feel very fresh while not doing anything particularly new. Machine Games did good here. I really hope that we'll see a sequel from them at some point!","December 3, 2014","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What didn't work in older incarnations was removed and replaced, what does work from modern shooters was integrated in, and the resulting game comes off as being smarter than the average gritty shooter tends to be. Levels are linear but contain multiple pathways; health regenerates, but only up to a point; cover is present, but can be created by the player via the blowtorch turn laser gun. Weapons are pretty standard: pistol, machine gun, shotgun, rifle, throwing knives, ect. but each one can be dual-weilded, which makes for three distinct playstyles; stealthy stab-'em-up, not so stealthy shoot-'em-up, and extremely unstealthy liquidize-'em-up. Which one you have to use at any given time is up to the player, as the game rarely forces you into stealth or cover.\n\nThe main story and main character are both kind of bland, but it seems that most of Bethesda's work went into the framework instead. Rather than the storyline that the player is actively participating in, the more interesting bits come from the period when Blazkowicz is a vegetable, between 1946 and 1960. The alternate history of that time is told on faded newpaper clips and audio logs, which is strangely effective in making the over-arching story more engaging. Same goes for characters; the protagonist isn't all that interesting, with a cyllinder for a head and speaking only in irritating gravely whispers, but the other characters seem much more human. None of them act overly patriotic or uncomfortably psychotic, but much more level-headed and believable.\n\nOverall, Wolfenstein: The New Order provides much more than you would expect from AAA shooters these days.","July 15, 2014","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a throwback to classic shooters which were devoid of hand holding, regenerating health and enemies with infinite grenades.\n\nEven though I abhor the idTECH5 engine, once I looked past it, I found a game that was oddly ... beautiful. The music is epic and adds to the atmosphere of the game. The story is even quite decent, which was an even bigger surprise.\n\nAll in all, I'm very happy that I cast my assumptions aside and actually made time to play the game.","September 1, 2014","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What didn't work in older incarnations was removed and replaced, what does work from modern shooters was integrated in, and the resulting game comes off as being smarter than the average gritty shooter tends to be. Levels are linear but contain multiple pathways; health regenerates, but only up to a point; cover is present, but can be created by the player via the blowtorch turn laser gun. Weapons are pretty standard: pistol, machine gun, shotgun, rifle, throwing knives, ect. but each one can be dual-weilded, which makes for three distinct playstyles; stealthy stab-'em-up, not so stealthy shoot-'em-up, and extremely unstealthy liquidize-'em-up. Which one you have to use at any given time is up to the player, as the game rarely forces you into stealth or cover.\n\nThe main story and main character are both kind of bland, but it seems that most of Bethesda's work went into the framework instead. Rather than the storyline that the player is actively participating in, the more interesting bits come from the period when Blazkowicz is a vegetable, between 1946 and 1960. The alternate history of that time is told on faded newpaper clips and audio logs, which is strangely effective in making the over-arching story more engaging. Same goes for characters; the protagonist isn't all that interesting, with a cyllinder for a head and speaking only in irritating gravely whispers, but the other characters seem much more human. None of them act overly patriotic or uncomfortably psychotic, but much more level-headed and believable.\n\nOverall, Wolfenstein: The New Order provides much more than you would expect from AAA shooters these days.","July 15, 2014","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game does not subsitute on beautiful animations, textures and level design.

It’s not radically innovative or revolutionary, but it does so many things to stand out in the current landscape that it doesn’t have to be. A brutal and charming adventure that doesn’t pull any punches but knows when to be light-hearted. The combat design and shooting mechanics (no restricted 2-weapon system, no need to aim-down-sights, multiple ways to approach enemy encounters, glorious hit feedback and gibs) are liberating while being supported by tough AI and fantastic weapons to shoot at them with, in more expansive levels that encourage exploration. Meanwhile, excellent storytelling through fantastic characters and the environment is happening all around you, rather than at you. Also, has one of the best soundtracks in a game with some of the most hard-hitting rock and metal with touches of industrial music that gets your blood pumping to fight for the resistance.\n\nIt brings the best of the old and the new. It’s exactly what people who complain about modern shooters should play, to see it’s not all doom-and-gloom. Personally, it has set a new standard in shooters.

Wolfenstein is an excellently executed single player only FPS that does more than simply line up a shooting gallery for you to run through.  Yes, there's tons of nazis that need killing, and yes, you still fight giant mechanical monstrosities, but I was actually more impressed by what they did with the characters.  BJ has the look of a man who's seen far too much, and there's this undertone about the horrors of war that carries nicely through the piece.  They do a lot to humanize BJ as more than just a standard FPS dude, and it plays very well.\n\nThe gunplay is very solid, and interestingly supports both a more run-and-gun playstyle along with a stealthier silent-takedown approach.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wraggle/recommended/201810/","wraggle","Wraggle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wraggle/","188 products in account","Wolfenstein is a good, solid, shooter that was fun and enjoyable to play. It is set mainly in the 1960s where WWII was won by Nazi Germany. You play as a soldier who was badly injured during an assault and has spent the past few years in a vegetable state in a hospital. The game seems to borrow from other games as at times it will feel very familar. In ways it is similar to the early Medal of Honor or the first Call of Duty games where you encounter enemies at a middle distance and they dive and shoot from behind cover. Other times it seems to have been influenced by Dishonored with the stealth sections and animated backstabs. It doesn't quite match those games in terms of execution of the mechanics but they are decent.\n\nWolfenstein's employs a standard mission and base system where you complete a few missions and head back to your base for a breather. It uses the base as a way of expanding on some of the characters and fill in the back story. There are some interesting, memorable characters in Wolfenstein but unfortunately that makes some of the others seem one dimensional. I feel that maybe with a bit more time, focus and care this game could have been truly great. The story is at times over the top which lends well to the gameplay, however around the midway point there is one to two chapters which are just plain dumb. It stupidly tosses in a "secret Jewish organisation" into the mix which, gladly, is only touched on for one chapter. Aside from that there are nice touches which help shape the story; such as the main character muttering about distant memories throughout the game.\n\nThe level design is very good generally with expansive indoor maps that allow you to do a bit of exploring. As a homge to the early Wolfenstein games there are gold objects and other hidden goodies littered throughout the game. Letters and newspapers are hidden to provide background and as in early 90s shooters enemies drop armour and ammo. The game strangely gets you to press E to collect these pickups which seems a bit odd. Simply running over them would have been a better choose. I actually liked the perk systems in this game as it is not intrusive. You gain perks by just repeating actions such as killing enemies with throwing knives or headshotting guards. There are four bands of perks which cover stealth play, assault play, tactical and demolition. You can purposely pursue them but I found they populated as I played.\n\nIt was nice for me to play a game where the movement is fairly quick, guns are snappy, and pack a punch. Dual-weilding chunky shotguns was a good throw back. There is a peek-from-cover move which I rarely used as you can just blast away. Wolf contains a laser cutting weapon which was versitile and upgradable. Again, if more time had been spend on it I feel it could have been as good as the Gravity Gun in HL2. There just aren't too many levels that explore its features fully. It also highlights a few inconsistences with the levels and "world". An example would be how certain metal sheets and surfaces are destructable yet some wooden panels or metal boxes aren't. I think it is more a restriction employed for consoles that hindered the game a bit. Its the same with the textures which can be low-res in some places. The game does run very smooth and I experienced no slow down.\n\nThe AI of the enemies is a lot better when they are fighting as it quickly becomes apparant that their stealth AI is sloppy. I've had guards look straight at me or see their colleague get shot just to turn and walk away. The first stealthy mission is the best as it has multiple routes the others are very hit and miss. Firefights however are very satisfying and can be challenging when you encounter the different types of soldiers. The game has a decent difficulty level which can cause you to die a few times when you get overwhelmed. Overall Wolfenstein is worth it as it is a fun experience. The majority of the levels are diverse in theme and design. It is not run and gun shooter of old but more of a blend of modern and old. There is no magic directional arrow showing you the way so sometimes you can get lost. I will be replaying this game again to see what I missed. It just misses out on being an 8 out of 10 game.\n\n\n","July 27, 2014","true","25.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not only because you can go every bit as crazy as in previous installments, if not even more, but because it reaches beyond the conventional boundaries.\nThe narrative and especially the characters have been given a lot more attention.

There's even a branch in the storyline as early as the end of the first mission. This means that some characters you will encounter and places you can go in levels change. It doesn't affect the gameplay dramatically, but it makes for at least some variation, warranting another playthrough.\n\nIf you're looking to dual-wield shotguns in a game world that's not just decorative but also brings an interesting take on an alternate history, you've come to the right place.

I don't regret pre-ordering this one bit. This is what storylines in games need to be like. With well-developed characters, alternate timelines, and protagonists you actually despise, a lot of game developers could take a lesson from Wolfenstein the New Order.\n\nThink about it. You can beat this game as quick as 10 hours, as long as 20. But you'll want to do it again based on a choice you make in the prologue that changes the story in a few different ways (including gameplay, to some degree). Because of how quiock you can beat this game, though, you'd think a lot of people would be dissatisfied. Heck, even I'm a bit disappointed by how short it is. And of course, many are still butthurt about no multiplayer. But the fact that the visuals, gameplay, and storyline are enough to counterbalance that? That's where developers need to take note. You don't need a massive sandbox to make a fantastic game (though it can be quite awesome). You don't even need multiplayer. All you need is a good story and good gameplay. Be original, and be compelling. Wolfenstein delivers there incredibly well.","May 26, 2014","true","40.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had such good memories playing the 3D and RtCW that when I started this, I was a bit concerned.  But no, life goes on, it is a different game, a 2010s gaming feel (though it is in 60s) and I appreciated the story a lot.  I liked the ending.  It was a dark future, but the game did not feel that claustrophobic.\n\nI thought the guns, even duel wielding, combat mechanics and graphics were great.  The mix of stealth and combat was good.  There was enough variation, like RtCW, in terms of gameplay and locations.  It certainly gave a bit console friendly feel but it was definitely a PC game.\n\nI also liked that you did not look around for weak spots of the map much for ammo health or other stuff.  I was mostly at max in most of them even at harder level.  Some like to play with ammo depletion and be thrifty, others like to 'search' the whole mape for some silly 'thing'.  This game takes away most of that frustration and only focuses on the actual game.\n\nThe cutscenes were nicely balanced with the gameplay.\n\nOn the negative side **includes spoilers**, the game difficulty felt easier than some other PC games.  It was not a walk in the park for sure, I played in difficulty 4/5.  But some stealth and combat was easy and I expected a higher challenge.\n\nI also expected a bit more 60s alternative life, but there was no 'normal life' around.  Maybe that it is the vision for Nazi victory.\n\nThe characters were fine, but could have been developed a bit more.  Also, the character development (Stealth, Tactics etc.) was not that clear or was a bit afterthought when I played.  It is not like an RPG for sure, maybe does not have to be either.\n\nMusic was missing for sure.  Maybe it was a part of this doomy future where you have no life signs apart from you and your friends.  I though RtCW's biggest plus was its music where you really felt like in Germany.\n\n\nOverall, I would have given 85/100 to this game and thank the developers for showing respect to a brand.  It felt good to play this and have a breeze from the past.  These type of games feel much more in connection with human than some other soulless shooters or 'horror' games or over analytical RPGs.\n\n\n\n","February 15, 2015","true","40.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What didn't work in older incarnations was removed and replaced, what does work from modern shooters was integrated in, and the resulting game comes off as being smarter than the average gritty shooter tends to be. Levels are linear but contain multiple pathways; health regenerates, but only up to a point; cover is present, but can be created by the player via the blowtorch turn laser gun. Weapons are pretty standard: pistol, machine gun, shotgun, rifle, throwing knives, ect. but each one can be dual-weilded, which makes for three distinct playstyles; stealthy stab-'em-up, not so stealthy shoot-'em-up, and extremely unstealthy liquidize-'em-up. Which one you have to use at any given time is up to the player, as the game rarely forces you into stealth or cover.\n\nThe main story and main character are both kind of bland, but it seems that most of Bethesda's work went into the framework instead. Rather than the storyline that the player is actively participating in, the more interesting bits come from the period when Blazkowicz is a vegetable, between 1946 and 1960. The alternate history of that time is told on faded newpaper clips and audio logs, which is strangely effective in making the over-arching story more engaging. Same goes for characters; the protagonist isn't all that interesting, with a cyllinder for a head and speaking only in irritating gravely whispers, but the other characters seem much more human. None of them act overly patriotic or uncomfortably psychotic, but much more level-headed and believable.\n\nOverall, Wolfenstein: The New Order provides much more than you would expect from AAA shooters these days.","July 15, 2014","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They just don't make 'em like this anymore. You can expect a solid 15 hours of gameplay (give or take up to 5 depending on your playing speed) for your first playthrough, that said the game makes itself replayable by having a choice in the first level which will slightly alter the gameplay and minorly affect possible routes you can go in levels. It's not much, but it's enough to give you an excuse to spend another 15 hours on it when you're bored some months (or years) after your first completion (or if you are just starving for more after you finish the game).\n\nMy only problems with the game were performance issues, I have a pretty high end machine but it seems that the game is very poorly optimized, for example it does not support triple buffering (so one of my major performance issues was that my framerate was jumping between 15/30/60 all the time when Vsync was enabled, the solution is to disable Vsync in the game options and to force Vsync with triple buffering on in your graphics drivers. Blame iD Software for this one.) And it also seems to have some caching issues. Load times between deaths can get extremely long as well (up to more than a full minute) but after dying an X amount of times in the same spot (2 or 3 times) it seems the game starts to load it faster. Don't ask me why.\n\nBesides the performance issues, the game was great all around, from the gameplay to the story, and even the characters. I also loved the entire soundtrack. The protagonist was your typical classic FPS type (like you'd expect from Wolfenstein or Doom games) which was kindof a nice kick in the nostalgia. It's an oldschool game making use of the capabilities of modern game development tools.

They tend to focus on multiplayer of which usually the player base dies within the first month as players are confused as to whether they are playing a part of a story or a deathmatch. By ignoring multiplayer altogether ID has produced a gem of epic proportions.\n\nWithin the first few minutes you are treated to an intro played out and not merely watched. With characters you relate to, the game gives you choices that affect those relationships. And if you allow it you feel as the protagonist does. Your hatred towards the Nazi's in this alternate timeline grows more and more. When a game can immerse you not just visually but mentally too then you have a winner.\n\nNow how does it play. Well here we have a classic style gameplay method mixed with modern effects. Like old ID games tou must pick up health and armour. However we have moved on from the walk over you must manually pick up using hotkey to do so. Which is a little irritating but understandable as it allows medpacks and armour to be hidden at times thus adding a little bit of realism to the game. The days of giant mansized medpacks are over people.\n\nDuel wield. Nice touch to the game I must confess to using this a little too much and it can at times make the game a little easy as accuracy is of such that you don't need to iron sight guns all too much and so you can use duel wield without actually sacrificing anything. So plus and a minus here.\n\nSecrets. A homage to Wolfenstein 3D I imagine. Gold objects are hidden around the levels what used to give you a score now is a game of find the Nazi gold. Fun for completionists but I have never been so inclined.\n\nI am glad that this game had the balls to use Swastikas. I have never been a fan of people changing the symbol of Nazi Germany to the iron cross. For 2 reasons one it is historically inaccurate and 2 it ironically associates the iron cross with Nazism, when it is a symbol of the German military pre, during and post Third Reich era. So way to go censorship is going to make the current German military seem like a bunch of Nazis.\n\nAI the AI does seem decent enough to be a challenge. The game uses the classic ID 5 levels of difficulty scheme. I started on second hardest but had to raise it to maximum for the challege but it is there. I think and average gamer could handle second to hard no problems.

Wolfenstein is an excellently executed single player only FPS that does more than simply line up a shooting gallery for you to run through.  Yes, there's tons of nazis that need killing, and yes, you still fight giant mechanical monstrosities, but I was actually more impressed by what they did with the characters.  BJ has the look of a man who's seen far too much, and there's this undertone about the horrors of war that carries nicely through the piece.  They do a lot to humanize BJ as more than just a standard FPS dude, and it plays very well.\n\nThe gunplay is very solid, and interestingly supports both a more run-and-gun playstyle along with a stealthier silent-takedown approach.

WARNING: Review contains minor early game spoilers but nothing major.\n\nIn Wolfenstein: The New Order you play as Captain Blazkowicz, a US soldier who is injured fighting against the nazi's, who then awakens years later to find they now rule the world. Now it is time to fight back, and lead the resistance against the Nazi's.\n\n\nPro's:\n\n+Amazing Graphics - on Ultra it has some of the best graphics I've ever seen in any game, and on low it is still better than most games.\n\n+Fun Gameplay - Dual weilding futuristic shotguns whilst blowing Nazi's to shreds has never been so fun!\n\n+Good Story - The story for this game is pretty good, it is well explained as to why everything happens, leaving no unanswered questions.\n\n+Lots to do - There are many collectables to collect and enigma codes to crack, doing which grants you more game modes!\n\n\nCons:\n\n-It's quite short - The story took me just 10 hours to complete, however it was very enjoyable and there is much more for me to do in future playthroughs, so I will likely complete it multiple more times.\n\n-In one of the first few missions you wind up getting injured and becoming a potato for 14 years. When you wake up you still have all your muscle, which isn't very realistic. Though it doesn't really affect anything so meh.\n\n-No multiplayer - I'm not really bothered by this, but with the story being so short and it being such a fun game, it would certianly have been a great feature to include.\n\n\nOverall I'd reccomend this game to essentially anyone who is considering getting it, it's one of the most fun games I've played in the last few years, and it's amazingly fun to take out rooms full of Nazi's whilst you dual weild gigantic machine guns. Overall I think I'd rate this game with a score of 87/100.","May 31, 2014","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's all single player focused gameplay and story\n+ Very memorable & well written cast of characters. NPCs dialog is sharp, fun and well done. Every NPC has their own distinctive, well written personalities that will stick with you\n+ Secrets! Every level/section has secret areas you can find with collectibles and powerups\n+ Great perk system. Instead of giving you perk points, you unlock any one of the many perks by completing objectives, for example, stealth killing 5 NPCs grants you a perk\n+ No pressure gameplay. You will run around and kill lots of baddies. This is not Metro where each fight must be carefully calculated. Run in, gun 'em down & move on. It's refreshing in it's simplicity. That's not to say it's an easy game, you will be challenged, but you don't need to over think it.\n+ Optional stealth objectives. Some areas can be entirely cleared by being sneaky\n+ Multiple paths. Most levels/sections have multiple ways to an objective. Do you take the vents? Go underground? Run around the backside?\n\n- Check point system, no free saves.

Prior to this I was following teh Wolfenstein group about this game for some time and I was looking forward to it. I've finished all of the Wolfenstein titles since their release on PC in May 1992, when the first person shooter genre was really bord.\n\nI grew up sitting on my dad's lap getting through Wolfenstein 3D and the Spear of Destiny, and I still play these games reguarly - it's impossible to kill such nostalgia.\n\nI love that the latest title (despite not being developed by id) actually implements an engaging story. It is primarily set in an alternate history where the German forces had an upper hand on World War II with stolen technology. You're sent into 1960 to work your way to the chief of Nazi science research. Navigating through Poland, Croatia, America and the Moon, you end up back where it starts where you were brutally victimized at castle Wolfenstein to finish what the protagonist William "BJ" Blazkowicz started with Willheim Strasse in Return to Castle Wolfenstein.\n\nI love the story and architecture which you come accross in the game, as it is entirely based off official nazi blueprints and designs which were planned on being used back in the day when the nazi party was officially in power. I love the locatioins you'll travel to, which include the great war itself, Willheim's castle, the Berlin catacombs, the Moon, a concentration camp, an asylum, a forced labour camp and the list goes on!\n\nI can't honestly say I don't not enjoy the game for anything, I cannot fault this game for any reason. Fantastic game, so get it when you can.\n\nEdit:\n\nMachine Games have announced a stand-alone DLC release which will be available basically two weeks short of one year from the original release date. In light of how much I love this release, I played through it once more on Uber.\n\nI can honestly say I've noticed a few subtle changes, certain sections have been made both easier and harder. Some items have been moved. All in all, I am happy with the content and changes I never experienced on initial release. I do feel now that some mechanics weren't refined very well, however there's nothing in the world that would change my opinion of this release.\n\nI have also pre-ordered Wolfenstein: The Old Bloodo on GMG, and I'm excited as hell to play that, though I doubt I'll be able to exceed my current stats for this game (82 hours).","July 24, 2014","true","82.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It also features good longevity and replay value, with a 20-25 hrs long main campaign enriched by various unlockables and a double storyline which changes according to the choice you make in the first chapter (there seems to be very little difference between the two though, kinda bummer).\nOne last thing worth of notice: weapon upgrades.

I bought this during the summer sale and finished it in about a week, which for me is a big thing. I barely finish games.\nWolfenstein is excellent. With an amazing soundtrack and impaccable voice acting & sound design to start, it's gameplay is solid and has a great, if linear and seemingly farfetched story. In fact one of my only criticisms is the fact that it's so linear - although I'm not sure how that could change, as is the nature of the Wolfenstein universe.\n\nPros:Amazing soundtrack that really gets you pumped. You can't really jump straight in because the main menu theme is so good\nBrilliant voice acting\nGreat gameplay. Firing an assault rifle is satisfactory on its own, let alone the multitude of entertaining ways you can spend your time killing nazis as you advance\nPretty good story. It's entertaining if unbelievable, what with the whole Nazis dominating earth, Da'at Yichud secret jew organisation, etc. etc. however it doesn't ever get boring.\nThe CHARACTERS. The antagonists can be truly ♥♥♥♥ing hated in every way, whilst the supporting cast are all a great bunch. Fergus, Anya, Klaus, even minor characters like Bombate are extremely likeable. However despite this, I do feel like a lot of them need more development. I've only played one run with the fergus timeline, but what the hell was the point in Tekla?\nA large amount of weapons in my opinion, with possiblilities to give each weapon a secondary fire mode which essentially changes the weapon completely in most cases\nKilling nazis on the moon. Giant frankenstein nazis. nazi robot dogs. Secret sciency jews who make floaty bomb things and super suits.\nYou can duel wield (almost) every weapon.\nRobotsCons:The game is very linear. There's very little freedom to do whatever you want, but I guess that's not necessarily a bad thing.\nAs far as collectibles go, there are several areas where they'll be displayed explicitly on your map, but in other sections you have no hints whatsoever. Not a bad thing for most people, but this inconsistency ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off a bit.\nThe gameplay in combination with certain other elements can be a little inconsistent, i.e. dramatic music continuing to play when you've already killed everyone.\nFor anyone who's affected by this, there is a ♥♥♥♥ton of gore (particularly at the end. But the ending is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing let me tell you)\nFor whatever reason, machine games decided to make our hero ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Blaskowicz ♥♥♥♥ anya at every opportunity despite him having barely talked to her over the past 14 years.\nFrau Engel is a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥There are probably a few things I've left out, but as a game which I've finished extremely quickly for the first time in a long time, I simply feel like I need to write this review. There are a few improvements which could be made but it's on the cusp of being perfect for me. 9/10.","June 23, 2015","true","14.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My suggestion for that is play it once on hard mode for the feeling of accomplishment for winning and then once on easy because there is nothing more fun than gunning down an army of Nazi’s as if you were the god of war himself.\n\nThe controls are robust and responsive.

It was kinda like the recent Shadow Warrior, in which I went into a shooter expecting all cheese and came out with a surprisingly decent story. The two main characters, Blaskowitz and Anya, are generally likeable. I like that BJ genuinely seems exhausted and worn down by everything that's happened, and his dialogue reflects that. Most the characters of the resistance are at first unlikeable, but then become genuinely sympathetic as you talk to them. I also like how they flesh out the world around you, a world in which everyone genuinely loves the Nazis and paints you as the terrorists. It creates this psuedo- I am Legend (the book) narrative where you're the monsters making everyone scared to leave their homes, but it's cool because they're Nazis. Unfortunately, it also leads to a massive plothole, which is that the game never really explains how killing the main bad guy is going to undo all this. The nazis have conquered every threat in the world and rule over (as the game points out) 75% of the world, and killing one dude isn't going to fix all that. Perhaps the story writers felt the same way, because the game ends without any closure, which annoyed me. I also didn't care for the choice at beginning, which changes a little bit of the story, because it feels like forced replayability, and I don't like that. Still, I did love the story, and only Transistor gave me a better one of those this year.\n\nGameplay: This was a bit of a sticking point to me. While the day I'm ungrateful at a chance to kill Nazis on the surface of the moon with dual laser machine guns is the day I officialy can't have fun anymore, the gameplay comes across as "Jack of all trades, master of none'. Do you want to run and gun, like Doom or the newer Shadow Warrior? Well, that's not an option, since limited ammo and the lethality of your enemies don't allow that playstyle to be viable. Do you want to use the stealth system to its max? That's not an option either, since you can only (at best) get 2 or 3 guys before everyone notices you. Do you want cover shooting? That's not completely an option either, since nazis spawn in from some weird places (half the time places you already cleared) to flush you out.\n\nSince this is a Wolfenstein game and everyone talked up the shoot 'em up aspect, the moment the game gave me dual assault rifles, I went charging into battle expecting the good 'ol shooter. Instead, I got shredded, leaving me wondering why the game bothered to give me dual guns when I spent most of it leaning out from behind cover and only changing positions when I was getting flanked. A gameplay hint pointed out that I can tailor the guns and such to my playstyle, but there was only one playstyle: walk in, try to stealth kill as many people as possible, then gun a few down as you run for cover and stay there until everyone's dead. I think the issue is that the average footsoldier can slice off too much health and is too accurate, so guns blazing isn't an option. It may sound like I just don't like difficulty, but I've played the Souls series, beat Lunatic+ on Fire Emblem Awakening, and am going new game + on Shovel Knight. Difficulty doesn't bother me, it just feels like the enemies are too difficult for what the game is trying to do. Also, the environment was too dull up until the moon base, so it was occasionally difficult to see the nazis, who blended into the dull environment with equally dull uniforms. I just wish the game would've picked a lane and stuck with it, because it ended with the same exact playstyle through most of the game. The wide open environments were nice, but I couldn't ever make full use of them.  TLDR: it's a restrictive gameplay that clearly wants you to experiment but inherently doesn't allow you to. Still, at the end of the day, I'm shooting nazis with dual-wielded rapid fire lasers on the surface of the moon, what more can I want? I'm planning on restarting on the easiest difficulty, just so I can go Rambo everywhere like I originally wanted.\n\nBut seriously, if they're making another one, I hope they decide to let that hotwiring system die a fiery death. I spent most of my time with it hoping the wires rebound close enough that I could use the awkward controls to put them back together before the anemic time allotted reset it.\n\nTechnical: I'm running this on a computer from 2010, so I've learned to expect a few problems here and there until I sawp out the graphics card, but there were a few weird issues. First, I had to update the graphics driver, because the lip-synching during gameplay was all off. Once that was done, I came back in and the lip-synching during gameplay was still off. The game would freeze every once in a while, usually after I died, and I'd sit there staring at a black screen for a minute or two before it got back into the game. So there was nothing gamebreaking, but still annoying.\n\nSo at the end of the day, though the gameplay wasn't as great as everyone painted it to be, I still had fun, enjoyed the story and hope to see more shooters try to mix things up.","January 5, 2015","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Is this game any good and was it worth Total Biscuit's GOTY 2014?\n\nYeah... it really kicks ♥♥♥!\n\nStory wise you start off in the WW2 era, fighting Nazis, after suffering a combat induced 14 year concussion/vegetable state you come-to in 1960. The Nazis have won the war. They control all of Europe, much of the USSR territory and the US has surrendered. Their campaign, however, still continues into Africa.\n\nYou play as the classic William "BJ" Blazkowicz, Nazi killer extraordinaire! At first I thought his voice acting and speech delays were a bit awkward until I realized he's really just a nice, "good 'ol boy" who is happy to be of assistance. There's just a thinking delay a bit before he speaks. Once I acclimated to how he talked, he really shined as a stand up guy with strong character. There are many, many other memorable characters and during the first mission you're given the choice of which friend to save, and in turn, unlock certain skills and pathways available during the main campaign. I choose Fergus and after doing some reading online it seems it was the better choice and a second play through wouldn't grant too much satisfaction. A second playthrough, with both story lines, is required for 100% achievement completion.\n\nYour missions in the game are great and holy cow are the transitions and story telling cut scenes spot-on. I was genuinely impressed at how they ended events and transitioned you to the next sequence. The story telling first-person shooter is not dead! After coming to in 1960, you go down the road BJ knows best, which is Nazi killing. I won't go into depth on the missions at risk of spoiling anything, but did you know the Nazi's have a base on the moon? *hint hint, nudge nudge*\n\nGun play was satisfying. The models looked gorgeous and were clearly Nazi-inspired. You can choose to dual-wield almost any gun you pick up for increased firepower, but you lose the ability to aim down the sights. Alternatively you're given a suppressed pistol, knife, and throwing knives to also go about stealth killing enemies. It's good to be practiced with both approaches as a stealth approach saves ammo, health & armor, and stealth killing commanders in the various areas will show on the map where the collectibles are. On the other hand the alarm will be raised at times and you will need to be ready to go in guns blazing.\n\nThe enemies are fairly repetitive, but the landscape varies enough to not make any fight boring. You do have occasional bosses and those fights felt pretty epic. As a whole the fights and story felt "epic", larger than life, and like you were really doing something special.\n\nYou have a perk tree for stealth, tactics (precision shooting), assault (dual wield), and demolition (boom?). Each tree helps you do each skill better, and gives a slight progression feeling to the game. I was able to unlock every skill in stealth and tactics fairly easily, but couldn't get 1 in the assault tree and demolition I more or less ignored =/\n\nBottom line, would I recommend this to a friend? Absolutely. If you like story focused first-person shooter games like Half-Life, or simply enjoy solidly built FPS games, then you'd absolutely enjoy Wolfenstein: The New Order. This game continued to impress as it progressed, I never got bored, and only occasionally got annoyed when I couldn't figure out how to get a collectible shown on the map (I typically Googled it).\n\nPlayed on an i5-2500k, GTX 970, 8GB DDR3, HDD.","June 24, 2015","true","13.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Its not perfect, but it is very good.\n\nPros:\n-Story 5/5:  Its an alternative historical fiction where Hitler obtains ancient and secret technology which allows the Nazis to win WWII.  Story is set in 1960s.  Extremely well done. Good narration, good pace, good originality, interesting, not too ridiculous if you can get over the hero’s apparent invincibility.  Its on par with the Half Life series.\n\n-Characters 5/5: Well done, most video games don’t put more than one thought into character design but this is top notch in my opinion.\n\n-GamePlay 4/5: Really good. Controls are a little non-standard but everything works great.\n\n-Stability 5/5: Not one crash, bug, glitch, nothing - ran 100% smooth (i5 4670 & GTX 980)\n\n-Nostalgia 5/5: Good throwback to the original but still fresh and competitive\n\n-Graphics 4/5: Nearly top notch with a few exceptions, namely the vehicles are very clumsy.  The humans and atmosphere look incredible.\n\n-Sound 4/5: Everything sounds good music is awesome. No sound sliders in options so music can only be muted but not turned down.\n\nQuality: 4/5\nFun Level: 5/5\nRecommend it 100%","December 21, 2014","true","14.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Which brings me to my only complaint, the AI is kinda blind when your sneaking, you can be a few meters in front of them and so long as your crouched, they pretty much ignore you.\n\nAll in all though its still a pretty excellent game, highly recomend it.\n","May 9, 2015","true","53.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics and visual effects are very good and the audio is also excellent. Stealth is a major factor in survival and can be used to eliminate with great success on most of the enemy including the nasty 'Armoured Dogs' that proliferate the game. Don't try this though on any mechanised robotic device as failure will be certain and will set you back somewhat causing you to start again from the last checkpoint. (Albeit not a major problem).\n\nWeapon options although at times limited do not seem to hinder the main character to any great degree as he is able to despatch most opposition with a minimum of fuss. Planning how you go about this is the important thing to consider as opposed to what you have to do to complete the task at hand. Bear in mind also that you need to replenished ammunition and health/armour regularly so take time to look around for possible and usually neccessary pickups, (approach and gather anything that glows for they will most likey be usable items).\n\nYou can collect 'Trophies' as well so investigate unusual looking objects and read notices on walls and desks for information (although this can be a little tedious at times when you are trying to get things done).\n\nIf you see a bed, have a sleep and you may be surprised at what happens when you do and my opening line will give you a hint as to what to expect!\n\nThe game is not open world in as much as you cannot simply move around free to do things as you wish and unlimited exploring is not an option, you go where your mission directs you and that's it!\n\nThis leads me to my main dislike, too many cutscenes that slow down gameplay. At times the player (me at least) is left saying "Not another one, I just want to get on with the game!"\n\nI guess the creators were trying to incorporate the feeling of abject misery (the prison scenes alone will assert to that), but may have allowed that idea to stem the flow effect as in pulling on the reigns which brings you to a grinding halt. This then gives the game a 'Build it up as you go' arrangement where you are completing missions which only help to build a small part of the next objective. For me that scenario can get a little tiresome, I am sure for others it is more than acceptable so it is all about what an individual wants and expects from a game, but these are my views and I accept that.\n\nIn conlusion (and now that I have completed the game), I recommend it as on the whole it is very good but for me at times a bit depressing. If that was the aim of the developers then they succeeded, I just felt a bit hobbled! The real action takes place about a third of the way through and from there it takes off and is excellent and should not dissapoint.\n\nTook approx. 15 hrs to go through first time (not bad), but missed many items that I will collect next time through. I would rate this game 7.5/10 and my screenshots will give you an indication of gameplay.\n\nCertainly worth a go, but maybe best to wait for a sale.\n\nAlso, a strong suggestion is to play Wolfenstein 'The Old Blood' first....It is a prequal and it does flow on to 'New Order'. Had I done this I would have started New Order with a different mindset and understanding.","April 3, 2015","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chriguana/recommended/201810/","Chriguana","Chriguana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chriguana/","129 products in account","I will start off by saying this is the best game I have ever played.\n\nI have played other games for longer. I have had more fun and laughed more from other games. But I can say without a doubt this game is the best I've ever played.\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order is a brilliant game. It's a thrill ride of ups, downs, and killing Nazis. The story is one of the best I've ever seen a game, and it's blend of adrenaline-pumping action with genuine moments of sadness and regret from the characters is very rare in a modern-day FPS. It expresses the true machinelike evil of the Nazis, and people dogged resiatance to them. Even in the darkest moments of the game, someone will always bounce back. Although it' s fictional(duh) and contains some fantasy elemenst (Jewish superweapons, anyone?), the story hits home with every one of us. Although we are thrust into the story just like that, Aas we sneak our way through each level and then inevitbaly  screw up, get caught, and bring out the dual-wield laser guns and automatic shotguns, we begin to understand what we are fighting for: freedom, and what we are fighting against: oppresion, imprisonment, gruesome cruelty(this gmae lives up to it's ESRB rating, and not in a good way) and of course, Nazis. The end, although bland, still left me in shock and awe from just everything this game has to offer. There were times when I almost felt like crying(as much as a game can make you cry), and throughout it all it was evident everyone was suffering(including the protaganist). The story is beyond anything else you will likely see in another FPS for a while. It's great.\n\nGameplay wise, Wolfenstien offers some refreshing mechanincs will still keeping true to the classic FPS elements that make the genre so popular. It offers plenty of options to stealth around; when the enemies start rolling in it offers some serious firepower. Nearly every weapon has an unlockable alternate firing mode and can be duel welded. With the lasercraftwerk, this game's equivalent of the gravity gun, you can do all kinds of stuff as you find new attachemnts for it, although its feels a little limited due to specific surfaces you can use it on. It also can provide a helping hand when your low on ammo and need a boost in firepower. The manual leaning is much preferable to an automatic system, although the controls are a little strange. I especially liked the no nonsense health value; get shot and the number goes down, get one the various helath kits in the game and the number goes up, if its gets to 0 you die. The armor is the same. Although a little unrealistic(especially with the armor), its provides a refreshing idea instead of the overused "immersive" health. Stealth is also quite good. Sneaking behind walls and shooting commanders when no one is looking gives me a thrill like no other. An early game choice determines whether you use stealth/lockpicking(my choice) or explosives/grenades(I think). Overall, some refershing ideas give the game a different look and feel then most FPS's.\n\nNow that my glowing review is over, we get to the not so great parts. Its just a couple so I made a list instead.\n\n\nTowards the end of the game, I felt like it fouced more on heavy firepower than slinking throught level with stealth.         I'm a huge fan of stealth so it got a little much towards the end(but it wasn't really that bad, just my personal preference)\nTechnology wise, the game has some major issues. A 50 gig download is unacceptable for a 10 hour game. It leads to horrendously long downloads for people with bad internet, and I couldn't put it on my SSD, making load time quite long, which got old real quick when i was restarting multiple times as I neared the end.\nThe game has some audio issues where the sound will mute if you fire different guns quickly, but this only happened four or five times.\nIt also has some texture pop issues. I only noticed it once but it was really obvious and broke the immersion. Other reviewers seem to state it happens more often.\nFinally the game's cutscenes are frame capped at 30 Fps. It's not awful, but its definetaly noticable when lots of things are flying around.\nOverall this game is thrilling, adrenaline-pumping, and a little bit disheartening. Some things the Nazis do in the game are quite appaling, but they really show the cold killing machine they were. Plus you kill an absolute buttload of them. When you take away the story, the mechanics, the characters, all the AAA fluff, this game is about killing Nazis. And that's a game I'd like to play.","January 30, 2015","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

EVER... so please forgive me for any errors in reviewing. First of all I'd like to start by saying that well.... I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE GAME! For me it was really amazing, this is the first game of the Wolfenstein series that I've tried and I love it love it love it (might try the old 2D one just for fun xD). Before I begin I'd like to apologise for its length, its kinda long but please bear with me.\n\nWhat I loved the most about the game was its concept, set in World War 2 and well, the Nazi's won and now they rule the world. That itself made it interesting enough to try. I liked the ideas that the producers thought of (the enemies and their uniforms) because they brought a nice combination of the retro Nazi soldier uniform (probably from the helmet) with well.... the "modern" soldier, its interesting to see it (at least for me). Especially with all the crazy technological advancements the Nazi's made in the game and of course.... throw at you... and believe me they got all sorts of crazy sh.. stuff. The game lets players use well... enough weapons, though i would say that a little bit more weapon types would be nice, to make the game more enjoyable.\n\nMild spoiler... The producers present 2 different storylines that each present slight differences in gameplay and what you can earn, I won't elaborate too much on this as I don't wanna be stoned as a spoiler. The best part is that completing one of the storylines allows the player to try the second, while keeping ALL of the achievements that he earned from the last play through (so the second playthrough should be more kick-♥♥♥), this also adds a little bit of value for your money spent on buying the game since honestly, it gets boring to complete a game over and over and over with only one storyline.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it follows the typical COD, or any action FPS genre (aim and shoot), though one thing that makes it stand out is that it gives players the options to Rambo their way through the level or to go Sam Fisher and sneak. But, the game adds these officers that will call for backup if alerted, the player's reaction would most likely be to target these officers, but they are usually in secure locations (and run away from the player if alerted) that are hard to reach if the tactic is a head on assault. Those who try to go Rambo run the risk of being overwhelmed (running out of ammo for me) should they forget/are unable to kill the officers as they can call in unlimited reinforcements (I haven't seen the officers run out of back-up before). Therefore the game promotes strategic thinking because players must learn to conserve ammo as the game is pretty cheap on ammo drops from dead enemies and take down officers quickly using tactics such as flanking, etc.\n\nI must say that the sneaking option in Wolfenstein is generally limited, at least in my opinion, because the sneak paths are usually pre-determined (take left lane for assault and right lane for stealth) and well honestly pretty stagnant. Though I do appreciate the producer's attempt at presenting more options for players. One thing I did not like about sneaking was that enemies that saw dead bodies were not alerted, (I mean I'd be pretty worried if I found someone who was standing at that one place ALIVE a few seconds ago dead when I turn my head) but I guess if the AI was that intelligent, the game would be extremely harder to beat using stealth as you must take out all enemies before something wrong is noticed (maybe introduce it as a hardcore add-on or something). I would ask for a body dragging/moving feature to make up for that. My favorite part of sneaking was finding hidden weapons/add ons that could improve the players fighting abilities, its okay to not find them, the game is still do-able... but it makes life easier.\n\nThe game features collectibles and a perk system to add a little bit of that 'oomph'. Collectibles make the game more interesting as you need to keep your eyes open and explore a little bit while blasting Nazi's away and gives more purpose for those 'die-hard' must finish 100% game guys... Moving on to the perk system, I loved this feature because it boosted abilities based on the players play style, there are perks that help in sneaking and those that help war junkies achieve mass destruction... This way the game actively promotes all styles of play, not just one and once again this helps present more options and gives incentive to try alternate styles of play (true for me).\n\nOverall, I really really do recommend this game cause it was just so much damned fun for me, I played all night cause I couldn't stop (don't follow in my footsteps as that is not healthy @__@). The only thing I didn't like about this game is its massive computer spec requirements, it was kinda laggy for me and of course that ruined my gaming experience, and its pretty damned big on your hard drive, 56 gigabytes for me (much larger than any game I ever had before).\n\nSo I guess this is it for now, so long, I hope this review helps those still wondering whether or not to buy the game, hopefully to buy it.\n\nP.S do NOT buy this game before you are absolutely sure you can at least run it on minimal, buying a game you can not play is a waste of money and I hate for anyone to experience that\n\nCheers, HipsterKiller\n","August 7, 2014","true","31.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At times the player (me at least) is left saying "Not another one, I just want to get on with the game!"\n\nI guess the creators were trying to incorporate the feeling of abject misery (the prison scenes alone will assert to that), but may have allowed that idea to stem the flow effect as in pulling on the reigns which brings you to a grinding halt. This then gives the game a 'Build it up as you go' arrangement where you are completing missions which only help to build a small part of the next objective. For me that scenario can get a little tiresome, I am sure for others it is more than acceptable so it is all about what an individual wants and expects from a game, but these are my views and I accept that.\n\nIn conlusion (and now that I have completed the game), I recommend it as on the whole it is very good but for me at times a bit depressing. If that was the aim of the developers then they succeeded, I just felt a bit hobbled! The real action takes place about a third of the way through and from there it takes off and is excellent and should not dissapoint.\n\nTook approx. 15 hrs to go through first time (not bad), but missed many items that I will collect next time through. I would rate this game 7.5/10 and my screenshots will give you an indication of gameplay.\n\nCertainly worth a go, but maybe best to wait for a sale.\n\nAlso, a strong suggestion is to play Wolfenstein 'The Old Blood' first....It is a prequal and it does flow on to 'New Order'. Had I done this I would have started New Order with a different mindset and understanding.","April 3, 2015","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chriguana/recommended/201810/","Chriguana","Chriguana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chriguana/","129 products in account","I will start off by saying this is the best game I have ever played.\n\nI have played other games for longer. I have had more fun and laughed more from other games. But I can say without a doubt this game is the best I've ever played.\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order is a brilliant game. It's a thrill ride of ups, downs, and killing Nazis. The story is one of the best I've ever seen a game, and it's blend of adrenaline-pumping action with genuine moments of sadness and regret from the characters is very rare in a modern-day FPS. It expresses the true machinelike evil of the Nazis, and people dogged resiatance to them. Even in the darkest moments of the game, someone will always bounce back. Although it' s fictional(duh) and contains some fantasy elemenst (Jewish superweapons, anyone?), the story hits home with every one of us. Although we are thrust into the story just like that, Aas we sneak our way through each level and then inevitbaly  screw up, get caught, and bring out the dual-wield laser guns and automatic shotguns, we begin to understand what we are fighting for: freedom, and what we are fighting against: oppresion, imprisonment, gruesome cruelty(this gmae lives up to it's ESRB rating, and not in a good way) and of course, Nazis. The end, although bland, still left me in shock and awe from just everything this game has to offer. There were times when I almost felt like crying(as much as a game can make you cry), and throughout it all it was evident everyone was suffering(including the protaganist). The story is beyond anything else you will likely see in another FPS for a while. It's great.\n\nGameplay wise, Wolfenstien offers some refreshing mechanincs will still keeping true to the classic FPS elements that make the genre so popular. It offers plenty of options to stealth around; when the enemies start rolling in it offers some serious firepower. Nearly every weapon has an unlockable alternate firing mode and can be duel welded. With the lasercraftwerk, this game's equivalent of the gravity gun, you can do all kinds of stuff as you find new attachemnts for it, although its feels a little limited due to specific surfaces you can use it on. It also can provide a helping hand when your low on ammo and need a boost in firepower. The manual leaning is much preferable to an automatic system, although the controls are a little strange. I especially liked the no nonsense health value; get shot and the number goes down, get one the various helath kits in the game and the number goes up, if its gets to 0 you die. The armor is the same. Although a little unrealistic(especially with the armor), its provides a refreshing idea instead of the overused "immersive" health. Stealth is also quite good. Sneaking behind walls and shooting commanders when no one is looking gives me a thrill like no other. An early game choice determines whether you use stealth/lockpicking(my choice) or explosives/grenades(I think). Overall, some refershing ideas give the game a different look and feel then most FPS's.\n\nNow that my glowing review is over, we get to the not so great parts. Its just a couple so I made a list instead.\n\n\nTowards the end of the game, I felt like it fouced more on heavy firepower than slinking throught level with stealth.         I'm a huge fan of stealth so it got a little much towards the end(but it wasn't really that bad, just my personal preference)\nTechnology wise, the game has some major issues. A 50 gig download is unacceptable for a 10 hour game. It leads to horrendously long downloads for people with bad internet, and I couldn't put it on my SSD, making load time quite long, which got old real quick when i was restarting multiple times as I neared the end.\nThe game has some audio issues where the sound will mute if you fire different guns quickly, but this only happened four or five times.\nIt also has some texture pop issues. I only noticed it once but it was really obvious and broke the immersion. Other reviewers seem to state it happens more often.\nFinally the game's cutscenes are frame capped at 30 Fps. It's not awful, but its definetaly noticable when lots of things are flying around.\nOverall this game is thrilling, adrenaline-pumping, and a little bit disheartening. Some things the Nazis do in the game are quite appaling, but they really show the cold killing machine they were. Plus you kill an absolute buttload of them. When you take away the story, the mechanics, the characters, all the AAA fluff, this game is about killing Nazis. And that's a game I'd like to play.","January 30, 2015","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I've known about the Wolfenstein series for years but  aside from a very brief playthrough of Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein: The New Order was the first time I payed serious attention to playing. And despite all the dissapointment from others, I say this is a great game almost undeserved of the complaining.\n\nThe levels are massive, on several maps I dropped my jaw at the scenery. Id software have gone to great lengths to make awe-inspiring scenes and even arenas for fighting. The AI itself is not stupid (mostly), i've been flanked by the rank-and-file and on higher difficulty levels I've been killed by being outsmarted by the AI (although on the opposite end I have seen soldiers stand in the middle of the floor to shoot me). This game is a love-letter not just to old-school shooters, but veterens of the Wolfenstein series as this game's story continues on from general Wolfenstein canon.\n\nI have not finished the story yet but so far it has kept me hooked. I feel for the resistance leaders, i feel for the poor people being oppressed. There are newspaper cuttings that detail events during the Nazi regime which move me to tears. Machine Games did a good job showing how grim this world is as at one point reading these cuttings I even wondered if this Nazi-ruled world was even worth saving.\n\nWith a low-end processor (Intel i3) I can't play with the shiniest graphics. I have seen several patches of low-res texturing but  after a while it didn't bother me, the game as great and the scenery was impressive nonetheless. The cutscenes are gorgeous and the animation is of very good quality. I'd say what Machine Games have done is actually fairly clever as despite my low-end processor as I could still witness moments of some very detailed modeling. While walking around, the PC performs idle animations even if he is just a pair of arms for the most part; checking ammo, priming the weapon and adjusting the sights or playing with his knife. I did have problems getting the game to work as I needed the very latest driver for my AMD graphics card and it took me some time to find the right 64x Catalyst Control Centre for WIndows 7.\n\nOverall I say we got what many old-school veterens want from the FPS genre: An affectionate throwback to the stuff we lost in the advancement of the shooter genre. But this game also includes modern concepts. I'm hunting for ammo, health packs and collectables while watching my ammo supply (old-school) while also shooting from cover down an iron sight (new-school).","July 6, 2014","true","29.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I went into it with minimum expectations and expected to just kill some time, what I got was an experience that I didn't expect. The game has some great shooting mechanics, very nice graphics and superb level design. It was very satisfying to tear through hundreds of Nazis in the world of The New Order. The story is actually pretty good too, it has some interesting characters and the dialogues are very well done. The game also provides some quiet time moments for you to get your bearings before you are put up against yet even more Nazi soldiers, which I like. It makes you appreciate the combat a lot more.\n\nThere is room for stealth, a lot of sections in the game give you the option to go full stealth. I myself quite enjoy stealth games, so definitely a one up for that. Of course you can also always go loud, your hand is not held nor are you held back by rules. It's just you versus Nazi Germany.\n\nWould I recommend it? Of course I would.

Nice environments. Nice cutscenes. Nice voice acting. Some nice guns.\n\nPoor enemy AI (the soldiers are really stupid. They get stuck on walls. They ignore their comrades being silently shot in the head. They ignore bullets hitting stuff in front of them, when you miss. They have terrible vision). For some reason you have to stand over every dropped item and press 'E' to pick it up. You can't just run over it. It took me a while to get comfortable with this, and I missed quite a bit, because it was hidden in corpses and I had to go fishing for it. Uber mode isn't challenging enough. And there is too much health and ammunition. The silenced pistol can kill soldiers with one shot to their helmeted heads, from a long distance, which sort of makes the AR marksman sniper rifle and dual-wielding assault rifles a bit redundant, But I guess it gives people two ways to play.\n\nI spent far too much time searching for collectables. I just wanted to get in to the game, go with the flow, but I felt obliged to waste time checking every part of the map for a side room where I might find a document or a golden object.\n\nThere is only one ending, which is fine, I don't expect every new game to have more than one. But I found the ending disappointing. There is no multiplayer, which doesn't matter because we can just go and play some other multiplayer shooting game.

I was a bit apprehensive because I was afraid there would be too many Halo or Call of Duty style elements introduced to the old formula to make it more palatable for modern gamers, but after playing the game through I can say that my fears were unfounded.\n\nAlthough Wolfentstein: The New Order has some modern elements, such as the perks system and weapon upgrades, it eschews the systems popularised by CoD and Halo, such as limited weapon loadouts (you can carry all at once, and dual wield almost everything), and reduces the importance of others; I didn't use the cover system at all, and although your health regenerates at very low levels, you will definitely be hunting for health and ammo. On top of that, the combat encourages you to run around a lot, bringing enemies on thick and fast and giving you few places to hide.\n\nThe level design is great, with environments that feel like real places but that are both interestingly laid out and packed with multiple layers, air ducts and hidey holes so that you are given some freedom in how you tackle the combat situations you are thrown into. Most of the time you can choose to play stealthily, or run in guns blazing, although the stealth system is not especially fleshed out, and the AI is extremely forgiving, so it just feels like a way to give the player some more options, and also make some tougher situations easier since you can just sneak round and take out key squad captains to prevent them from setting off the alarms.\n\nThe weapons in this game are mostly the standard fare, but they all feel very good to use and are all useful in different situations. There is one weapon that is used throughout the game to great effect, which allows you to cut through fences, break chains, or switch modes and use it like a railgun. The heavy cannons in the game also cut holes in some walls, sometimes revealing secrets or ammo caches in crates scattered around the battleground. All weapons can be upgraded by finding modules around the levels, or by getting perks, which are given if you achieve some specific goal, such as performing 5 silent takedowns to get a silenced pistol.\n\nThe story actually added to the game for once. There are fairly few action FPS games where the story adds a lot to the game, but here it provides a great setting (alternative WW2 where Nazi Germany took over the world), and is well written and compelling enough that you do care what happens, regardless of how cliched the whole resistance fighter thing has become. Having said that, I did feel a bit cheated by the ending.\n\nIf you were holding out on Wolfenstein: TNO like I was, definitely consider grabbing it, as it straddles the lines between modern and retro FPS brilliantly, providing satisfyingly creative combat with a compelling and immersive story and uses some modern smarts to round out the corners and make a more forgiving game than those you might remember playing 15 years ago.","December 28, 2014","true","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics and visual effects are very good and the audio is also excellent. Stealth is a major factor in survival and can be used to eliminate with great success on most of the enemy including the nasty 'Armoured Dogs' that proliferate the game. Don't try this though on any mechanised robotic device as failure will be certain and will set you back somewhat causing you to start again from the last checkpoint. (Albeit not a major problem).\n\nWeapon options although at times limited do not seem to hinder the main character to any great degree as he is able to despatch most opposition with a minimum of fuss. Planning how you go about this is the important thing to consider as opposed to what you have to do to complete the task at hand. Bear in mind also that you need to replenished ammunition and health/armour regularly so take time to look around for possible and usually neccessary pickups, (approach and gather anything that glows for they will most likey be usable items).\n\nYou can collect 'Trophies' as well so investigate unusual looking objects and read notices on walls and desks for information (although this can be a little tedious at times when you are trying to get things done).\n\nIf you see a bed, have a sleep and you may be surprised at what happens when you do and my opening line will give you a hint as to what to expect!\n\nThe game is not open world in as much as you cannot simply move around free to do things as you wish and unlimited exploring is not an option, you go where your mission directs you and that's it!\n\nThis leads me to my main dislike, too many cutscenes that slow down gameplay. At times the player (me at least) is left saying "Not another one, I just want to get on with the game!"\n\nI guess the creators were trying to incorporate the feeling of abject misery (the prison scenes alone will assert to that), but may have allowed that idea to stem the flow effect as in pulling on the reigns which brings you to a grinding halt. This then gives the game a 'Build it up as you go' arrangement where you are completing missions which only help to build a small part of the next objective. For me that scenario can get a little tiresome, I am sure for others it is more than acceptable so it is all about what an individual wants and expects from a game, but these are my views and I accept that.\n\nIn conlusion (and now that I have completed the game), I recommend it as on the whole it is very good but for me at times a bit depressing. If that was the aim of the developers then they succeeded, I just felt a bit hobbled! The real action takes place about a third of the way through and from there it takes off and is excellent and should not dissapoint.\n\nTook approx. 15 hrs to go through first time (not bad), but missed many items that I will collect next time through. I would rate this game 7.5/10 and my screenshots will give you an indication of gameplay.\n\nCertainly worth a go, but maybe best to wait for a sale.\n\nAlso, a strong suggestion is to play Wolfenstein 'The Old Blood' first....It is a prequal and it does flow on to 'New Order'. Had I done this I would have started New Order with a different mindset and understanding.","April 3, 2015","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Nice environments. Nice cutscenes. Nice voice acting. Some nice guns.\n\nPoor enemy AI (the soldiers are really stupid. They get stuck on walls. They ignore their comrades being silently shot in the head. They ignore bullets hitting stuff in front of them, when you miss. They have terrible vision). For some reason you have to stand over every dropped item and press 'E' to pick it up. You can't just run over it. It took me a while to get comfortable with this, and I missed quite a bit, because it was hidden in corpses and I had to go fishing for it. Uber mode isn't challenging enough. And there is too much health and ammunition. The silenced pistol can kill soldiers with one shot to their helmeted heads, from a long distance, which sort of makes the AR marksman sniper rifle and dual-wielding assault rifles a bit redundant, But I guess it gives people two ways to play.\n\nI spent far too much time searching for collectables. I just wanted to get in to the game, go with the flow, but I felt obliged to waste time checking every part of the map for a side room where I might find a document or a golden object.\n\nThere is only one ending, which is fine, I don't expect every new game to have more than one.

I've known about the Wolfenstein series for years but  aside from a very brief playthrough of Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein: The New Order was the first time I payed serious attention to playing. And despite all the dissapointment from others, I say this is a great game almost undeserved of the complaining.\n\nThe levels are massive, on several maps I dropped my jaw at the scenery. Id software have gone to great lengths to make awe-inspiring scenes and even arenas for fighting. The AI itself is not stupid (mostly), i've been flanked by the rank-and-file and on higher difficulty levels I've been killed by being outsmarted by the AI (although on the opposite end I have seen soldiers stand in the middle of the floor to shoot me). This game is a love-letter not just to old-school shooters, but veterens of the Wolfenstein series as this game's story continues on from general Wolfenstein canon.\n\nI have not finished the story yet but so far it has kept me hooked. I feel for the resistance leaders, i feel for the poor people being oppressed. There are newspaper cuttings that detail events during the Nazi regime which move me to tears. Machine Games did a good job showing how grim this world is as at one point reading these cuttings I even wondered if this Nazi-ruled world was even worth saving.\n\nWith a low-end processor (Intel i3) I can't play with the shiniest graphics. I have seen several patches of low-res texturing but  after a while it didn't bother me, the game as great and the scenery was impressive nonetheless. The cutscenes are gorgeous and the animation is of very good quality. I'd say what Machine Games have done is actually fairly clever as despite my low-end processor as I could still witness moments of some very detailed modeling. While walking around, the PC performs idle animations even if he is just a pair of arms for the most part; checking ammo, priming the weapon and adjusting the sights or playing with his knife. I did have problems getting the game to work as I needed the very latest driver for my AMD graphics card and it took me some time to find the right 64x Catalyst Control Centre for WIndows 7.\n\nOverall I say we got what many old-school veterens want from the FPS genre: An affectionate throwback to the stuff we lost in the advancement of the shooter genre. But this game also includes modern concepts. I'm hunting for ammo, health packs and collectables while watching my ammo supply (old-school) while also shooting from cover down an iron sight (new-school).","July 6, 2014","true","29.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Better than Wolf 2009.  Just as good as RtCW.  It features a fantastic blend between old school shooter and modern FPS conventions.  Chiefly and critically, it's an old school shooter in that you have MANY different weapons, each suited to a different situation or enemy composition.  Couple that with the fantastic EVERYTHING else (story, graphics, art design, etc.) and Wolf TNO is the best game I've played this year (which admittedly it doesn't have much competition due to work obligations).\n\nI have been very critical of the old school shooter revival games over the last few years (Serious Sam 3 and DNF suck; Hard Reset and Shadow Warrior are great).

But compared to the penultimate rendition of "Wolfenstien" (Oddly enough called Wolfenstien), The New Order does away with the sandbox environment for a more conventional linear approach to missions - this being said on many maps there is the option of taking unique or multiple routes to gain access to areas of the map or objectives. This allows the focus of the game to be brought back round into the narrative/ story, the atmosphere and the gunplay.

I mean this game is just your\nversion of quintin terrentino's Inglorious basterds, where your character\nWilliam Bj Blazkovics is bassicaly your brad pitt from Ingloriouse ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\nTho we all know he just the rebooted version of the preiviouse BJ, but\nslighty camparable with the movie, anyways. The game Starts off in 1946, where\nmr BJ blaztohats is taking on the new fortress head quaters, the Third\nRiech. Only to be blasted and swallowed by the sea as he takes a piece of\nShrapnel to the face. Spends 14 years as a vegatable in a polish mental\nHealth institute where he meets his favorite nurse whome he falls so sexually in\nlust with, ( w.e the ♥♥♥♥ her name is ).\n\nThe game works as usual picking up health and armor packs to stay afloat\nas you grind your way past waves of nazis. Which btw I find it neat that\nyour armor is not only a flack jacket but you can pick up other armor looking\nmaterials that give you points towards deffence. There are diffrente mechnaics\ninvolved in combat when dealing with the variety of diffrente types of nazis.\nSuch as juaggernaut to the shotgun weilding soldeirs, to mechs!\n\n\nThe switch between stealth missions, also adds some vareirty and somewhat\nserenity to the fast action killer. It allows you to actually think and pursue\nyour targets which happen to High ranking Officers, whome can run and sound the alarm\nAnd wreck havoc on your mission.\n\nPerks allow you to gain small yet unotciably bonus to the game.They are\naquired through acts of combat during the game and some perks can be easly\nforgotton.I believe I looked at my perk tree, twice the entire time I played\nthe game, they just wernt absolutly needed, but do add some help to the gameplay.\nby adding extra ammo, or allowing you to sprint faster while duel weilding.\n\nThe level design, ok This is what really got into the game.\nThe levels have so much detail, there is an impressive amount that went into making this\ngame and it shows.Idk if I can say much for the console users, but for PC\nthis game just looks and feels amazing. Some levels offer cookies that unlock level art\nfor later use to stare in awe of the massive designs that went into each level.\nEven sending mr BJ to the moon at one point for some very futuristic battles with\nupgraded weapons!\n\nThe laser cutter adds to the games puzzle design allowing players to actually have to think\nabout where to go next, or allowing players to find shortcuts or extra ammo or life in small\nholes.The laser gun getting upgraded was a neat fix, so it dint seem like the same old gun\nafter a while, you actually can use it and have it rival with even the best of you arsenal!\ni mean litteraly you can make a nazi pop like a balloon when you have it fully upgraded!\n\nSO in all the game is a great game, deffeenitly something every gamer needs in there library.\nAs far as first persons go, this game is a great mix of all your favorite fps elements.\nLevel design keeps you in pure awe and the combat keeps you at an max\nblood rusher state. So for my final review Im giving this game a 9/10!!\nyes thats what it deserves and I would give it 10 but theres just one thing that I have to do,\nI have to hate on something. The RESPAWN. The respawn is needs to get fix like seriously,\nidk how many times iv raged over it but there needs to be something done about it cuz DAMN.\n","June 11, 2014","true","15.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is the grandfather of shooters and this iteration brings what it promises. The game provides ample oppurtunities to mow enemies down in various ways, plus where else can you dual wield assualt rifles?\n\nThe graphics, many people complain about the textures, pop-in and quality, but honestly the game looks gorgeous. It will have you exploring the world just so you can see all the smaller details developers added in. The gameplay is solid brining what a Wolfenstein needs to bring, guns, guns and even bigger guns.\n\nNow then, the few issues encountered can easily be solved with a patch so its not really game breaking in nature. This is one of the few games that upon launch I encountered no game breaking bugs. Which is a fresh experience in its own right.\n\nIs the game worth $60? In my opinion, yes. If you are a Wolfenstein fan then you need to be playing this game. The developers went through a lot of trouble to bring the old school feel of previous Wolfensteins ooze from this game while at the same time making a new game.\n\nNow to comment on story, the story of the game is interesting and some parts even cliche but it is a Wolfenstein game, if you play for the story then you should not be playing. The game alos has a perk system which is unique in that you unlock perks through actions, for example killing 10 enemies in stealth will provide a perk that makes stealth kills more deadly and efficeint.\n\nWolfenstein The New Order, I give 8.5/10","June 15, 2014","true","17.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This being the only setting that is actually HARD, all the others are rather easy. This coming from someone who was born in the early 90's just in time to catch the "classic-difficulty" thing that has been thrown around by older gamers.\n\nSecond note, is more of a complain really. The Enigma-codes, are rather annoying. I'm waiting for someone who has the time and brainpower to solve it and post the answers, mostly because its very hot outside (around 28-30c) so i really cant be bothered to boil my brain over code-breaking a notoriously high-math encryption system. With absolutely no pointers on how to do it. It would have been easier to have the codes decrypt automatically.\n\nBut those were not the only gripes that i had with Wolfenstein, oh no...\n\nYou remember that "20h Campaign" thing that they threw around in some interviews and press ? It only is that long if you play the game twice. The game has this different time-lines thing going, in the beginning you get to make a choice on who will be in a more major part in the game as part of the resistance. This splits the time-line into two, rather indistinguishable parts. Doing either one, opens different routes through certain levels and giving different bonuses (Health/Armour) to be found. Other than that, there really is no other reason to switch time-lines, other than completions sake.\n\nWhat comes to the collectibles there are the classic gold-objects to be found, reasonably well hidden. I have tried to gather all that i can, this being rather easy since they are usually shown on the map. Some hidden objects are not shown on the map, this got really annoying in some areas where you though you already collected everything. Spending a great deal of time running around like a headless chicken trying to find that one golden egg... On the other hand. There is also ”Germanized” (if that qualifies as a word..) Vinyls of famous sixties music, unfortunately the one I can spot and make the connection to, is the Beatles one. And the records sound, mostly nice and if memory serves there is a want to listen the whole collection of this music. I unfortunately cant remember where.. I wish that they would have included more of them into the game.\n\n\nBut enough of my personal nags, lets get into the real reviewing.\n\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order. Is an Alt-History FPS, in which Nazis won WW2 and conquered the world with strange technologies and weapons. You take the role of B.J Blazkovich, The Guy, The Legend, The Original ”One Man Army”. And start in a very scripted section inside an airplane.. But don't go crying ”Bloody Murder!” just yet, the start section, although very scripted is actually rather well done and impressive. And after that you are washed up on the shore next to the main bad guys fortress and here the actual shooting sections begin. I will not spoil the plot any further than this, mostly because I feel that the story is well crafted so well that spoiling it, would be a right crime.\n\nLets just summarize the story into the simplest for, that I can steal from someone else. Its like Inglorious Basterds, but as a video-game.\n\n\n\nGraphically the game looks pretty decent, but the color-pallet they went with was the all too familiar “Next-Gen shooter” assortment of bland grays and browns. With very little identifying colors popping out from the blandness. Not to get stuck on the excuse of “it was the desired effect, because its depressing”. The only game in my opinion that did that right was The Saboteur. (Personal bias showing like a motherf*cker.)\n\nBUT, speaking of popping. Id-Tech 5, had the tendency for some extreme texture-popping and for unfortunately, its very apparent in Wolfenstein. The only way I got around it, was to lower the texture-detail. But this made everyone “look like a horrid burn-victim” and before someone else decides to show their opinions on why that is. I HAVE THE MACHINE POWER TO PUT THE TEXTURES ON ULTRA, its the games own optimization thats bollocked up. What else ?\n\nI know that most of the games environments are.. Linear to say the least. Again falling into the “Next-Gen”-bin.. (Ignoring that.) And their way around it, with the two separate time-lines, really doesn't show enough difference to be mentioned. Only serving as a rather lazy way (in my opinion) to pad out the games length.\n\nBut in its core-mechanics, as an FPS with the “Classical”-twist. Wolfenstein does its job and does it extremely well. It is very satisfying to either sneak up on your enemies and stick your knife into various orifaces, or just say “f*ck this” and pull out your machineguns (notice the blural, referring to dual-wielding.) and just go nuts. One thing that was mildly dissappointing, was that the laser-weapon that is acquired rather early in the game, really serves no other purpose than to be the gimmick. Sure its usefull later against the Super-soldaten, but thats about it and no matter how frequently I looked for some piece of metal-cover to cut for a tactical advantage, I only managed to do it, again too few times to be mentioned. Not counting the vent-covers, but since that is mandatory, its immediately off the list.\n\n\nWell I think I have whined enough, to start summarizing. Lets see...\n\n\nSemi-decent Graphics. Solid fun old-school style shooter-action. Oh and I musn't forget the all so delightfull nod-back to the original Wolfenstein with the difficulty-selection icons. But getting distracted.. Very linear, but well crafted story. Padded out length and some other minor gripes...\n\nOh dear this is very hard for me, I cannot give it an A-Rank. And taking into account that I havent looked at all what the game has to offer (f*cking Enigma-Codes..).  AAARGh.\n\nWell, until I have managed to take a look at the “new game-modes” that is SAID to hide under the Enigma-Codes.\n\nI think, I must give Wolfenstein: The New Order.\n\nB.\n\n\nI'l settle for that rank, until I have determined whether or not, there is another ending hidden within the Enigmas. After that I will raise the rank with a +. AND THAT WILL BE IT. #DEALWITHIT\n\n\nEDIT: Well, as some industrious fellow managed to crack the enigma-codes, i can safely say. It really isnt worth it. The only notable thing is an ironman-mode, so the rank stands. Simple as that..","May 31, 2014","true","39.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Excellent shooter mechanics and surprisingly well written moving story. If you liked Half-life 2 you'll love this game.\n\nMedium:\nWhen we write the history of video games as an art form I believe this game will be remembered as a landmark for its treatment of sex. The game boldly makes it clear up front that sex is part of Blazkowicz's relationship with his love interest, yet they manage to do it in a way that elevates it from simple lust or an exploitive attempt to sell sex to a depiction of an intimate experience shared between people who truly love one another.\n\nLong:\nThis game fails to live up to the legacy of previous Wolfenstein games. When I see Wolfenstein in the title of a game I think men with biceps so large they have difficulty wearing anything with longer sleeves than a muscle shirt, chin clefts so deep you could build a mineshaft in them, machismo levels so high that they punch on sight any sissy who actually uses the word "machismo", and ranges of emotion that lead you to suspect they've undergone a partial lobotomy. To all outward appearances this perfectly describes the protagonist William "B.J." Blazkowicz. In previous games Blazkowicz has always been little more than a 1940's Duke Nukem with just barely enough taste not to quote bad movies while killing Nazis. As a result I came into the game expecting "Generic Nazi Murder Simulator 2014". That is not what I got.\n\nThe story of Wolfenstein: The New Order as any synapses will tell you is the tale of jarhead William "B.J." Blazkowicz waking up in an alternate universe in which the Nazi have won WW2 and taken over the world. He has to lead the resistance, tear down their symbols of power, bring hope to an otherwise hopeless and dreary world, yadda yadda yadda something something Half-life 2. This is all true. However the game is in many ways Half-life 2's better in many ways. The writing is shockingly good. In inner dialogues and exchanges with his companions we occasionally glimpse something deeper and more sensitive through Blazkowicz's solemn and emotionless mask. We begin to see him not as a man who does not feel, but as a man who hides his feelings for fear that they will make him weak and destroy him. At the end of the first mission he (and thus the player) is forced by a villain to make a sort of Sophie's choice, with no third option save for a gameover. It's a horrible and terrifying scene during which we see him at his most vulnerable, and while he doesn't show any visible emotion it clearly leaves mental scars which stay with him for the rest of the game.\n\nIt's not just his ability to feel pain the game shows us either. It's his ability to feel love. When we write the history of video games as an art form I believe this game will be remembered as a landmark for its treatment of sex. The game boldly makes it clear up front that sex is part of Blazkowicz's relationship with his love interest, yet they manage to do it in a way that elevates it from simple lust or an exploitive attempt to sell sex to a depiction of an intimate experience shared between people who truly love one another. While she initially appears to be a vulnerable maiden in distress, over the course of the game we begin to see that she is in many ways Blazkowicz's counterpart. Just Blazkowicz conceals sensitive soul inside a warriors body, we learn that she conceals a warriors soul inside her fragile exterior.\n\nThe ending is also not what you'd call typical of stereotypical FPS games. I don't want to spoil it because it's actually quite moving. Oh and the FPS bits are quite nice too.","December 29, 2014","true","10.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

With its old school style of carrying 10 guns, duel wielding anything, and health & armor pickups it really was a refreshing break away from current shooter trends.\n\nThis iteration of Wolfenstein also added some interesting new mechanics and approaches the perk system many games incorporate in a more personal way.  Instead of leveling up and spending points on skill unlocks, Wolfenstein let's you play it your way, and specific benefits unlock as you perform certain challenges.  This way you're never pigeonholed into singular play style.  There are four style trees to shape the play that suits you best:  Stealth, Tactical, Assault, and Explosive.   You'll be doing a little of each style so it's recommended to complete as many challenges as possible to get the benefits.\n\nThe one thing that took me by surprise the most was the story.  There was actually a well written, and voice acted story behind this shooter.  It was effective in boiling my hatred for the cruel and merciless enemies, that I felt sweet revenge when piling up the Nazi body count.\n\nThis was pure old school shooter fun with modern improvements, and I'm going on record to predict a FPS Game of the Year award.","August 2, 2014","true","18.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lthatch/recommended/201810/","lthatch","lthatch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lthatch/","323 products in account","So. Wolfenstein. Probably not the game you'd expect to hit the some of the highest heights of storytelling that you’ll see in a game. Also probably not the game you'd expect to deliver it all with a deep and frequently creative narrative. Creative manners of evisceration, is perhaps more in line with preconceptions, but certainly not in presentation, tone and story in which The New Order excels. All of the pieces of Wolfenstein may not be new, but the manner in which it is told is debilitating fresh, and effective. Within thirty minutes, you’re hooked, with one of the most effective openings you’ll see in any form of this genre. If you couldn’t already tell, The New Order does a great deal to subvert your expectations.\n\nBy appearances, the alternate history setting of Nazi domination, complete with quazi-supernatural weapons and cement is utterly absurd, and with a lead character when initialised harks back to the Duke Nukem era, it often seems like Wolfenstein is doing all it can to undermine itself. Thankfully, elements from that setting are picked with care, highlighting and providing insightful, if not undiscovered (we've had a lot of texts about war guys) commentary on dystopia, power (or the distinct lack thereof) and universal causality. Thankfully, the game never takes itself too seriously, lest it sway too far from the somewhat pulpy  topic, managing to blend the more light-hearted elements of its roots with a sickly, cynical and all-round rather lovely tongue in it’s cheek.\n\nWolfenstein, and the folks over at Machine Games know how to craft a tale, and it's this presentation on which The New Order can hang its hat. It achieves levels of beauty, nuance, and depth frequently reached for by other studios, but almost as frequently lays unobtained. In contrast to practically every other game of this size, The New Order knows when to shut the hell up. Dialogue and timing is sharp and acerbic, animation is top-notch cinematography is often stunning, conveying a tremendous sense of confidence in its presentation, close to all of it earned. It’s super slick, and often a joy to expertise and partake in. Characters are strongly defined in a concise and engaging manner, setting them up to be utilized in a cacophony of intelligent and sincere personal relationships, but engage with the setting in a remarkably mature and often darkly comedic manner. While it can occasionally feel that the size of the cast being dealt with is a little too large for what is a 10 hour game, Wolfenstein is nothing if not constantly engaging, and the many twists, turns and heavy-hitting moments you encounter along the way lead up a remarkable conclusion that embodies all that this game does right.\n\nAll of this seems to forget the combat system within the game, which is, on most levels, serviceable, if not much else. The combat is pretty stock standard. You've got your iron sights, you've got your hypermobility, and you've got your moments of typical action-movie scale. A means of differentiation is the game’s dual wielding mechanic, which lets you forgo accurate aiming for, say, a couple of semi-automatic shotguns. While initially fun, it doesn’t have the legs as a core gameplay mechanic (perhaps exacerbated by the ammo shortages you’ll usually find yourself in) Stealth is usually a valid option, but you're not incentivised to go in any particular direction, as going in guns ablaze is usually equally effective, and will get you in and out in quicker time.  One criticism is the mini-bosses scattered throughout the game. These mechanised soldiers are boringly bullet-spongy, usually requiring spending a couple of minutes ducking in and out of cover, intersected with the unloading with a machine gun for a few seconds.\n\nThankfully, the combat is more than enjoyable enough to pull through what is one of the most effective examples of explicit storytelling within a video game. If you’re interested in what a linear experience can provide when taken in context with what is effective in other forms of media, or just want to hear what is a remarkably enjoyable and thoughtful story, The New Order is a game you shouldn't pass over.","June 19, 2014","true","9.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I can't really find fault beyond nitpicks. It's a very competent shooter with a surprisingly well acted story. I'll even say that this is one of the few games that actually sold me on the obligatory love subplot. This kinda surprised me, coming from a game that is, at it's core, 'there's a nazi, shoot him'.\n\nI did mention a few Nitpicks, and in no real order:\n\nThe split timeline 'mechanic' is... Not really explored. There's only maybe one level that actually changes due to your choice. Minor changes thanks to a tiny minigame, but they're... Generally not used for anything but secret items. There's no change in enemies and no change in weaponry... So it feels tacked on.\n\nSome enemies are grossly bullet spongey, even on 'normal' difficulty. The game has about 4 or so points where you will see that loading screen an asninine number of times because some INCREDIBLY heavily armored jerk murders you. They don't even have to reload! The normal guys do (Or at least they take breaks between bursts). Maybe a future patch will fix it and I'll be able to scrape this off the list of minor irks. Don't take me wrong, The game can be finished... But that final level is REAL annoying.\n\nFinally... If you're the kind of person that goes 'Oooh, Alternate history!' (Like me) and go to look for all the changes, you'll be as disapointed as I was to find out the alternate history tracks from the trailers is basically your lot. I do understand that licensing and recording and junk... But it was a let down none the less not to hear something like an alternate Rolling Stones or The Kinks ('Sie haben mich wirklich' anyone? Just me?)\n\n\nOh. And some levels are quite linear. But hey, fish swim, birds fly, levels in 2014 are quite linear.\n\n\nThere. That's really all I got. It's not a back-to-basics shooter in the vein of the original... But it takes just enough from it in such a competent manner that it's worth getting.","June 21, 2014","true","15.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have never played a Wolfenstein game before and actually got this due to the graphics resembling the Bioshock series. I am glad I had the oppertunity to play this gem. War, violence, sex, guns, robots and the freaking moon walking and moon weapons all created something fantastic with a greater story line to slot it all together. You also get to visit Berlin, London and many exciting locations in this alternative universe.\n\nThis game has everything.

That game was a wonderful shooter and still, to this day, I'll take any opportunity to say "Frightened, American?"\n\nWell New Order stacks up very well, indeed. No lip service branding here: every bit of this game is evidence of the developers love for the Wolfenstein franchise. The game is a pure shooter for sure - but everything seemes to flow so well within it; the death animations, the gun balance, the play based skill trees, and the cut scenes actually feel to augment the experience. And the experience is nazi killin' fun.  The subject matter is [i]dark[/i], though. The game makes you feel what the natural extension of a Nazi victory would mean, and some of that is very unsettling.\n\nI'd recommend this game to fans of the franchise or to anyone looking for a story based thrill ride. It certainly delivers. Not pefect for sure (some of the skill trees "unlocks," can be a little silly and the AI isn't perfect), but very, very fun.\n\nOh, and, "Frightened, American?"","June 23, 2014","true","36.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This being the only setting that is actually HARD, all the others are rather easy. This coming from someone who was born in the early 90's just in time to catch the "classic-difficulty" thing that has been thrown around by older gamers.\n\nSecond note, is more of a complain really. The Enigma-codes, are rather annoying. I'm waiting for someone who has the time and brainpower to solve it and post the answers, mostly because its very hot outside (around 28-30c) so i really cant be bothered to boil my brain over code-breaking a notoriously high-math encryption system. With absolutely no pointers on how to do it. It would have been easier to have the codes decrypt automatically.\n\nBut those were not the only gripes that i had with Wolfenstein, oh no...\n\nYou remember that "20h Campaign" thing that they threw around in some interviews and press ? It only is that long if you play the game twice. The game has this different time-lines thing going, in the beginning you get to make a choice on who will be in a more major part in the game as part of the resistance. This splits the time-line into two, rather indistinguishable parts. Doing either one, opens different routes through certain levels and giving different bonuses (Health/Armour) to be found. Other than that, there really is no other reason to switch time-lines, other than completions sake.\n\nWhat comes to the collectibles there are the classic gold-objects to be found, reasonably well hidden. I have tried to gather all that i can, this being rather easy since they are usually shown on the map. Some hidden objects are not shown on the map, this got really annoying in some areas where you though you already collected everything. Spending a great deal of time running around like a headless chicken trying to find that one golden egg... On the other hand. There is also ”Germanized” (if that qualifies as a word..) Vinyls of famous sixties music, unfortunately the one I can spot and make the connection to, is the Beatles one. And the records sound, mostly nice and if memory serves there is a want to listen the whole collection of this music. I unfortunately cant remember where.. I wish that they would have included more of them into the game.\n\n\nBut enough of my personal nags, lets get into the real reviewing.\n\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order. Is an Alt-History FPS, in which Nazis won WW2 and conquered the world with strange technologies and weapons. You take the role of B.J Blazkovich, The Guy, The Legend, The Original ”One Man Army”. And start in a very scripted section inside an airplane.. But don't go crying ”Bloody Murder!” just yet, the start section, although very scripted is actually rather well done and impressive. And after that you are washed up on the shore next to the main bad guys fortress and here the actual shooting sections begin. I will not spoil the plot any further than this, mostly because I feel that the story is well crafted so well that spoiling it, would be a right crime.\n\nLets just summarize the story into the simplest for, that I can steal from someone else. Its like Inglorious Basterds, but as a video-game.\n\n\n\nGraphically the game looks pretty decent, but the color-pallet they went with was the all too familiar “Next-Gen shooter” assortment of bland grays and browns. With very little identifying colors popping out from the blandness. Not to get stuck on the excuse of “it was the desired effect, because its depressing”. The only game in my opinion that did that right was The Saboteur. (Personal bias showing like a motherf*cker.)\n\nBUT, speaking of popping. Id-Tech 5, had the tendency for some extreme texture-popping and for unfortunately, its very apparent in Wolfenstein. The only way I got around it, was to lower the texture-detail. But this made everyone “look like a horrid burn-victim” and before someone else decides to show their opinions on why that is. I HAVE THE MACHINE POWER TO PUT THE TEXTURES ON ULTRA, its the games own optimization thats bollocked up. What else ?\n\nI know that most of the games environments are.. Linear to say the least. Again falling into the “Next-Gen”-bin.. (Ignoring that.) And their way around it, with the two separate time-lines, really doesn't show enough difference to be mentioned. Only serving as a rather lazy way (in my opinion) to pad out the games length.\n\nBut in its core-mechanics, as an FPS with the “Classical”-twist. Wolfenstein does its job and does it extremely well. It is very satisfying to either sneak up on your enemies and stick your knife into various orifaces, or just say “f*ck this” and pull out your machineguns (notice the blural, referring to dual-wielding.) and just go nuts. One thing that was mildly dissappointing, was that the laser-weapon that is acquired rather early in the game, really serves no other purpose than to be the gimmick. Sure its usefull later against the Super-soldaten, but thats about it and no matter how frequently I looked for some piece of metal-cover to cut for a tactical advantage, I only managed to do it, again too few times to be mentioned. Not counting the vent-covers, but since that is mandatory, its immediately off the list.\n\n\nWell I think I have whined enough, to start summarizing. Lets see...\n\n\nSemi-decent Graphics. Solid fun old-school style shooter-action. Oh and I musn't forget the all so delightfull nod-back to the original Wolfenstein with the difficulty-selection icons. But getting distracted.. Very linear, but well crafted story. Padded out length and some other minor gripes...\n\nOh dear this is very hard for me, I cannot give it an A-Rank. And taking into account that I havent looked at all what the game has to offer (f*cking Enigma-Codes..).  AAARGh.\n\nWell, until I have managed to take a look at the “new game-modes” that is SAID to hide under the Enigma-Codes.\n\nI think, I must give Wolfenstein: The New Order.\n\nB.\n\n\nI'l settle for that rank, until I have determined whether or not, there is another ending hidden within the Enigmas. After that I will raise the rank with a +. AND THAT WILL BE IT. #DEALWITHIT\n\n\nEDIT: Well, as some industrious fellow managed to crack the enigma-codes, i can safely say. It really isnt worth it. The only notable thing is an ironman-mode, so the rank stands. Simple as that..","May 31, 2014","true","39.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Excellent shooter mechanics and surprisingly well written moving story. If you liked Half-life 2 you'll love this game.\n\nMedium:\nWhen we write the history of video games as an art form I believe this game will be remembered as a landmark for its treatment of sex. The game boldly makes it clear up front that sex is part of Blazkowicz's relationship with his love interest, yet they manage to do it in a way that elevates it from simple lust or an exploitive attempt to sell sex to a depiction of an intimate experience shared between people who truly love one another.\n\nLong:\nThis game fails to live up to the legacy of previous Wolfenstein games. When I see Wolfenstein in the title of a game I think men with biceps so large they have difficulty wearing anything with longer sleeves than a muscle shirt, chin clefts so deep you could build a mineshaft in them, machismo levels so high that they punch on sight any sissy who actually uses the word "machismo", and ranges of emotion that lead you to suspect they've undergone a partial lobotomy. To all outward appearances this perfectly describes the protagonist William "B.J." Blazkowicz. In previous games Blazkowicz has always been little more than a 1940's Duke Nukem with just barely enough taste not to quote bad movies while killing Nazis. As a result I came into the game expecting "Generic Nazi Murder Simulator 2014". That is not what I got.\n\nThe story of Wolfenstein: The New Order as any synapses will tell you is the tale of jarhead William "B.J." Blazkowicz waking up in an alternate universe in which the Nazi have won WW2 and taken over the world. He has to lead the resistance, tear down their symbols of power, bring hope to an otherwise hopeless and dreary world, yadda yadda yadda something something Half-life 2. This is all true. However the game is in many ways Half-life 2's better in many ways. The writing is shockingly good. In inner dialogues and exchanges with his companions we occasionally glimpse something deeper and more sensitive through Blazkowicz's solemn and emotionless mask. We begin to see him not as a man who does not feel, but as a man who hides his feelings for fear that they will make him weak and destroy him. At the end of the first mission he (and thus the player) is forced by a villain to make a sort of Sophie's choice, with no third option save for a gameover. It's a horrible and terrifying scene during which we see him at his most vulnerable, and while he doesn't show any visible emotion it clearly leaves mental scars which stay with him for the rest of the game.\n\nIt's not just his ability to feel pain the game shows us either. It's his ability to feel love. When we write the history of video games as an art form I believe this game will be remembered as a landmark for its treatment of sex. The game boldly makes it clear up front that sex is part of Blazkowicz's relationship with his love interest, yet they manage to do it in a way that elevates it from simple lust or an exploitive attempt to sell sex to a depiction of an intimate experience shared between people who truly love one another. While she initially appears to be a vulnerable maiden in distress, over the course of the game we begin to see that she is in many ways Blazkowicz's counterpart. Just Blazkowicz conceals sensitive soul inside a warriors body, we learn that she conceals a warriors soul inside her fragile exterior.\n\nThe ending is also not what you'd call typical of stereotypical FPS games. I don't want to spoil it because it's actually quite moving. Oh and the FPS bits are quite nice too.","December 29, 2014","true","10.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A game that had me somewhat worried after hearing some really bad thing about it during E3, Bethseda being the publisher and a new studio making this new entry to the Wolfenstein franchise and now that it is released i decided i would get it instantly anyway, cause of curiosity. Now that i finished my first playthrough i can safely say that this is the best game released so far.\nIt gives you the Old school shooting, if not more insane than it's previous entries and a damn good story. Like a mix of old Wolfenstein and Inglorious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nThe game is roughly 11-15 hours long with the possibility for some different approaches on the levels with some hidden secrets here and there and offers 2 different options you do at the beginning that changes the overall story completley, making it worth it to play through it twice.\n\nThe game has some problems but just minor, you occasionally encounter some of the worst AI in the game during "stealth" levels but these moments are mostly short and does not really take away from the overall gameplay. Second is some optimising issues, i hear the Radeon users are going through hell to play this so thankfully im using an Nvidia card but the minor issue i had with shadow resolution on max is that the game ran at steady 60 fps but after reloading around 5-6 times(example after a death) the game goes into slowmotion, running at 4-6 fps which i recommend lowering to lowest possible before starting or until a patch to fix it has arrived.\n\nGraphically i think it looks pretty good, shows much better than RAGE what ID tech 5 can do and runs really well with an i7 2700k, GTX670 and 8gb ram. It has unfortunetly some lower res textures and graphical glitches although very few. (noticed 1 or 2 times at start of the game)\n\nOverall it's a amazing game, Machine Games has done a great job and i hope they get to do more or even do something with any of the other ID game.\n\nTo end this review, IT'S TENOUTTATEN, GO BUY IT!","May 22, 2014","true","32.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The graphics are nothing ground breaking but the visuals are still appealing nevertheless. The story is really good so far and the voice acting is actually pretty solid. My only issue in the game so far is the fact that the game occassionally lags intensely when i start it up, which forces to restart the game in order to get it to stabilize again, my rig is capable to run this game on max with ease and my drivers are updated so i really I do not know what the issue is.","May 21, 2014","true","26.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's beautiful, it oozes atmosphere at every turn, it humanizes characters that you'd think would be blank slates, the action is intense and there's tons of freedom in how to fight, and it's somehow a game that took a concentration camp level completer with crematoriums and made it not just pure shock, but actually a very well done segment, and the villians are legitimately compelling and people you grow to hate. Like, it's a low bar, I'll admit, but name to me one better videogame at portraying how actually evil the Nazis really were rather than just having them as things to shoot, while also being incredibly fun to shoot.","December 6, 2014","true","28.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

For something that has been bounced around between developers and publishers as much as it has, it has been remarkably consistent. The New Order is the fifth game in the series (not counting multiplayer only Enemy Territory), and they all share a continued continuity, to the point that a character from Raven’s Wolfenstein from a few years ago is in this game despite the developer and publisher changing between releases. For 2014, Wolfenstein is in the capable hands of MachineGames, a group headed up by ex-Starbreeze employees that were at the forefront of story driven FPS games of the last decade. Their talents have transferred over here, bringing stealth and moments of calm to a universe most known for its nonstop Nazi killing. It all comes together into a stunning mixture of engaging story and visceral gunplay that will leave you wanting more as the end credits roll.\n\nWant more?

Even without those fixes, this game is one of the few, if not, the only one to ever make my jaw drop! It's not just because of the graphics (that only takes up 10%, of my jaw dropping), its all because of the mixture of classic gameplay (No health regen, just med packs) & modern gameplay (enhanced gun mechanics, reloading, etc), The ability to carry all the weapons you find (Not just 2), tactically (not punishingly) hard difficulty settings, and a 10 out of 10 Storyline!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/recommended/201810/","Levyne","Levyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/","141 products in account","Like many of you (probably), I grew up playing things like Wolf 3D, Doom, Duke 3D, Rise of the Triad, Blake Stone, Hexen, Heretic. That's out of order and I think I did manage to avoid Quake somehow, but whatever. I was something like 4? I did this until I was around 8-10 and my parents got me a N64 instead of a computer so I got into Mario, Zelda, the usuals. so I've been out of the FPS loop for awhile. Just starting in 2012 or so did I really start diving into the Bioshocks, Metros, Singularity, I even gave Wolf 09 a spin. I enjoyed most all of them except Singularity, haha. Unfortunately, never a Starbreeze game. So even though I was hopeful for this title I didn't really know what I was getting into with that pedigree thrown around since it doesn't mean much to me. But I was hopeful regardless, and it looks like my blind faith paid off pretty well.\n\nIt's really fun to kill Nazis. Not really a better way to put it. Watching them fall apart as you overwhelm them, using all the different weaponry, scoping from cover or guns blazing, or clearing out a whole floor with a silenced approach was pretty great. Even though it was highly useful for my Uber playthrough, I wish the thrown knifes and silenced pistol weren't so broken. I ended up avoiding using the pistol in the later half of the game because it was so boring. The knives were similar but a notch harder to acquire and aim so I used that whenever I felt like it. I love how the perks reward you for playing the game in multiple ways, instead of just being acquired skill poiints into a tree or something. It was a little distracting and silly when I found myself failing a checkpoint so that I could work on different perks, but that's on me I suppose. One of my favorites was the one that healed you for doing the melee takedowns. Something satisfying about gunning down a nazi and not wanting to wait for the reload animation so I would just run up to him, slit his throat. and get some health back. Once I learned how powerful the scoped LKW was, that was also and enjoyable tool in the arsenal.\n\nThe game starts with some really open map design which gives you a lot of freedom to do those things I mention. However, somewhere around chapter 10-11 it ends up becoming a bit more straightforward, where the game seems to send you from "arena" to arena. This is still really fun, and a lot of the encounters have enough paths and levels that it doesn't feel constricting. It was just not as good as the first handful of chapters in this respect. However, I do think that the later locations are much more interesting in general. Chapter 12, for instance, was my least favorite and really soured me with how it was organized. However, it was also a pleasure to just look at and move around in.\n\nI think the game has some really great smoke/dust effects, is it just me?\n\nI'm not as high on the narrative. While the game doesn't feel as disjointed as some other titles, I have to remind myself about how things connected from one chapter to another. At one point you get on a train and end up in a uboat and it just felt a bit abrupt. BJ seems to survive a ton of ♥♥♥♥ that doesn't really make a lot of sense, but maybe it's just some sort of protagonist invincibility. A lot of the characters just don't play as much of a role in order for them to be memorable to me. I played on the Wyatt timeline (that's not really a spoiler right) and having to play alongside him early on cemented his relevance so to speak. Some of the other characters were just not important until chapter 15. While I'm saying all this though, it's not like I want more cutscenes (I think the extent of the narrative and frequency of cutscenes was fine.), so maybe I'm unsure about what I actually want here. I do think that the..cinematography, if that's the right word, was pretty good. It reminded me actually of RE5 in that way (not in quality, but in the "camerawork" and things like that.) I apologize if I sound a bit silly here. I'm not sure how to put it into words.\n\nNot super high on the new BJ either. He was kind of unremarkable to me. I don't really get the "favorite protagonist" accolades that I've seen. He does have a pretty interesting design and voice and isn't as generic as he might initially appear. I guess I enjoy that he's subtle (when not sprint sliding dual shottgunning a nazi troop). We don't really hear him yell or scream much nor does he get too dramatic about anything. The inner musings were generally nice and well written, some very memorable lines. Broke your ♥♥♥♥. Some of them felt like they were trying too hard to make him seem somewhat detached. Buoy . And I felt like the poetic use of the count to four line had worn itself thin by the end of the first chapter.\n\nI can't wait to play on easy to just have the leash slackened so that I can just use whatever I want and cover the floors in gibs in the most stylish ways possible. I was disappointed in the number of push wall type secrets, but I reserve the right to backtrack on that statement due to the possibility that I simply just missed them. Most everything was just kind of lying about, Speaking of, there's something satisfying about just running into a room with Nazis firing on your ♥♥♥, spamming the pickup button to re-up on health, armor, ammo, whatever, and then turning around and using whatever you just managed to scrap together. Much more rewarding than hiding behind cover until the red jelly goes away. At first I thought that the 20 health increments for the regen was too broad, but I suppose on Uber I ended up appreciating it a fair bit. Being able to pick up items by walking on them would be nice I suppose, but later on in the game it didn't really bother me that much.\n\nThat chapter 14 boss was a neat spectacle but I wish there was more to it. The chapter 16 boss was fitting and grounded. By that I mean it wasn't ridiculous and over the top, but still sufficiently momentous that it was a satisfying ending to the journey. It will be interesting to see to what extent the alternative timeline changes things up. It's a good excuse to go back on easy and collect stuff.\n\nEdit: The home base stuff was forgettable, enough so that I needed to add it in to mention it.

The first chapters do a good job at making you feel like a badass and encourage you to try diffrent playstyles. Unfortunatlly in the last half of the game the it becomes a slog, where enduring bullet sponge badguys is the norm.

The founders are from Starbreeze Studios, they were the key members that made Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay and The Darkness, two shooters that did very well and are some of my favorite story driven FPSs.\n\nI was hoping they would put Wolfenstein back where it belongs, at the top. I really liked Rage and the direction it was taking but it was lacking something. MachineGames found out what that something was and Wolfenstein The New Order has that classic shooter feel without feeling "stiff."\n\nStory: The story is fantastic and the characters are all memorable. What stood out the most was the way they portrayed B. J. Blazkowicz (the main protagonist). He was the main character from the original Wolfenstein 3d also and I feel they couldn’t have portrayed him better. I love his monologues. Also I liked how there are 2 timelines. Depending on a what choice you make in the beginning the game will feel a little different. That was also a nice touch. I won't say more than that though.\n\nGameplay: The guns are great. They feel awesome and they are different and shine when you use them at the right time. Brings back the feeling from classic shooters when you used different weapons for different enemies to conserve ammo. You could run through the game with the assault rifle but you would run out of ammo a lot I feel. There are also gun upgrades you come across when you play through the campaign. These upgrades are also kept across playthroughs. Also the dual wielding is lots of fun. Running through tight corridors dual wielding auto shotguns splattering Nazis faces along the way felt good. The perk progression is cleverly organic and is based on your play style. As you you play, the way you kill and the weapons you use unlock perks that give you passive bonuses. The perks are little things like faster sprint while dual wielding, a larger grenade pouch, etc. After completing the game the perks remain in effect giving you a chance to survive on Uber difficulty.\n\nAI: There were a few times the AI was a little derp but it more often was deviously efficient in putting the pressure on. I played the game on “I Am Death Incarnate!” (a step above normal) and there were plenty of times the AI put me down with well timed flanking and pressure. After beating the game I went to the chapter select (hell yeah!) and tried a few of the easier difficulties and the enemies seem to go down faster but aside from that were still lethal.\n\nSound: The music is awesome and feels like a classic id game. You got nice metal tracks to kill Nazis to. The sound effects were awesome and the voice acting was well done and made all the characters more memorable.\n\nGraphics: Wow, 40 gb not wasted. The game is gorgeous. I don't know what the game looks like on consoles and I haven't a single **** to give. On the master platform this game is fantastic looking and runs a lot better than Rage. I’m running 2 GTX 780 TIs in sli. I turned off sli and ran the game on Ultra w/vsync to see how it played. A few times I had to restart from a checkpoint the game would lag (frame rate tanked to like 2) as the textures tried to catch up. Enabling VT Compress in the advanced graphics options fixed this issue. I did not have this issue while in SLI (more graphic mem to go around). To be honest I couldn’t tell the difference with VT Compress on or off. The game is breathtakingly beautiful, I cant stress this enough. I’m in love with the idT5 engine and I cant wait to pay Doom (4).\n\nLets be honest, I bought Zone of the Enders 2 for the MGS: Sons of Liberty demo and this this is not very different. I had a feeling this game was going to be awesome but what sealed the deal for me was the Doom Beta. I am pleasantly surprised by how good this game is above my expectations.

There's always a chance that  it won't be good enough for bunch of reasons.. hell, I myself didn't really like the previous Wolfenstein game though I'm a big fan of shooters. I grew up on id software games. Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny were among the first games I ever played and remain one of my favorites for the rest of my life. So I was really sceptical about this game but God knows I was wrong...\n\nThis game is really darn good. You understand that developers knew what they were doing from the very beginning, which means when you get to the main menu to choose your difficulty you realise that this trip is going to be veeery awesome. And it really is! Everything about this game is near perfect: plot, graphics, gore/blood, dialogues, cut-scenes, jokes, easter eggs etc. Even the main character, B.J. Blatzkowizc, is slightly resembling the old one despite all the modern graphics!\n\nI can only point out two minor things which in my opinion mar the impression of the game a little:\n- ragdoll behavior, which sometimes made me burst out laughting\n- floating objects (seen two times through the game. I guess it's a common thing in modern games like Metro: Last Light)\n\nAnyway this stuff is so rare that you just don't pay attention to it at all.\n\nI recommend this game to everyone no matter if you fan of the franchise or not. If you are you will be pleasantly surprised and if you're new to the franchise then you'll enjoy the very well-made game.\n\nAnd I enjoyed every second of it. 10/10","June 11, 2014","true","44.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

That's out of order and I think I did manage to avoid Quake somehow, but whatever. I was something like 4? I did this until I was around 8-10 and my parents got me a N64 instead of a computer so I got into Mario, Zelda, the usuals. so I've been out of the FPS loop for awhile. Just starting in 2012 or so did I really start diving into the Bioshocks, Metros, Singularity, I even gave Wolf 09 a spin. I enjoyed most all of them except Singularity, haha. Unfortunately, never a Starbreeze game. So even though I was hopeful for this title I didn't really know what I was getting into with that pedigree thrown around since it doesn't mean much to me. But I was hopeful regardless, and it looks like my blind faith paid off pretty well.\n\nIt's really fun to kill Nazis. Not really a better way to put it. Watching them fall apart as you overwhelm them, using all the different weaponry, scoping from cover or guns blazing, or clearing out a whole floor with a silenced approach was pretty great. Even though it was highly useful for my Uber playthrough, I wish the thrown knifes and silenced pistol weren't so broken. I ended up avoiding using the pistol in the later half of the game because it was so boring. The knives were similar but a notch harder to acquire and aim so I used that whenever I felt like it. I love how the perks reward you for playing the game in multiple ways, instead of just being acquired skill poiints into a tree or something. It was a little distracting and silly when I found myself failing a checkpoint so that I could work on different perks, but that's on me I suppose. One of my favorites was the one that healed you for doing the melee takedowns. Something satisfying about gunning down a nazi and not wanting to wait for the reload animation so I would just run up to him, slit his throat. and get some health back. Once I learned how powerful the scoped LKW was, that was also and enjoyable tool in the arsenal.\n\nThe game starts with some really open map design which gives you a lot of freedom to do those things I mention. However, somewhere around chapter 10-11 it ends up becoming a bit more straightforward, where the game seems to send you from "arena" to arena. This is still really fun, and a lot of the encounters have enough paths and levels that it doesn't feel constricting. It was just not as good as the first handful of chapters in this respect. However, I do think that the later locations are much more interesting in general. Chapter 12, for instance, was my least favorite and really soured me with how it was organized. However, it was also a pleasure to just look at and move around in.\n\nI think the game has some really great smoke/dust effects, is it just me?\n\nI'm not as high on the narrative. While the game doesn't feel as disjointed as some other titles, I have to remind myself about how things connected from one chapter to another. At one point you get on a train and end up in a uboat and it just felt a bit abrupt. BJ seems to survive a ton of ♥♥♥♥ that doesn't really make a lot of sense, but maybe it's just some sort of protagonist invincibility. A lot of the characters just don't play as much of a role in order for them to be memorable to me. I played on the Wyatt timeline (that's not really a spoiler right) and having to play alongside him early on cemented his relevance so to speak. Some of the other characters were just not important until chapter 15. While I'm saying all this though, it's not like I want more cutscenes (I think the extent of the narrative and frequency of cutscenes was fine.), so maybe I'm unsure about what I actually want here. I do think that the..cinematography, if that's the right word, was pretty good. It reminded me actually of RE5 in that way (not in quality, but in the "camerawork" and things like that.) I apologize if I sound a bit silly here. I'm not sure how to put it into words.\n\nNot super high on the new BJ either. He was kind of unremarkable to me. I don't really get the "favorite protagonist" accolades that I've seen. He does have a pretty interesting design and voice and isn't as generic as he might initially appear. I guess I enjoy that he's subtle (when not sprint sliding dual shottgunning a nazi troop). We don't really hear him yell or scream much nor does he get too dramatic about anything. The inner musings were generally nice and well written, some very memorable lines. Broke your ♥♥♥♥. Some of them felt like they were trying too hard to make him seem somewhat detached. Buoy . And I felt like the poetic use of the count to four line had worn itself thin by the end of the first chapter.\n\nI can't wait to play on easy to just have the leash slackened so that I can just use whatever I want and cover the floors in gibs in the most stylish ways possible. I was disappointed in the number of push wall type secrets, but I reserve the right to backtrack on that statement due to the possibility that I simply just missed them. Most everything was just kind of lying about, Speaking of, there's something satisfying about just running into a room with Nazis firing on your ♥♥♥, spamming the pickup button to re-up on health, armor, ammo, whatever, and then turning around and using whatever you just managed to scrap together. Much more rewarding than hiding behind cover until the red jelly goes away. At first I thought that the 20 health increments for the regen was too broad, but I suppose on Uber I ended up appreciating it a fair bit. Being able to pick up items by walking on them would be nice I suppose, but later on in the game it didn't really bother me that much.\n\nThat chapter 14 boss was a neat spectacle but I wish there was more to it. The chapter 16 boss was fitting and grounded. By that I mean it wasn't ridiculous and over the top, but still sufficiently momentous that it was a satisfying ending to the journey. It will be interesting to see to what extent the alternative timeline changes things up. It's a good excuse to go back on easy and collect stuff.\n\nEdit: The home base stuff was forgettable, enough so that I needed to add it in to mention it. Fluff.","May 23, 2014","true","55.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Since its announcement, there was a certain level of uncertainty surrounding the game; the public’s expectations were a little low, myself included, and there didn’t seem to be a lot of buzz behind it.\n\nThe FPS genre has its fair share of mediocre, uninspired, and vanilla shooters where the act of shooting bad guys becomes tiresome and uninteresting. Having little experience with the Wolfenstein series, I feared that any redeemable aspects of the game would go over my head as feelings of nostalgia from referential content would be lost on me. Admittedly, there were a lot of pessimistic feelings entering the game. But I’m happy to say I underestimated Wolfenstein: The New Order – what I expected to be just another shooter turned out to be a very solid one with a surprisingly emotional and intelligent story.\n\nQuite frankly, it is one of the best shooters I’ve played in recent memory. With quality action, an emotional story, and likeable characters, Wolfenstein: The New Order is a smart shooter that pulls no punches.\n\nfull review: http://www.relyonhorror.com/reviews/review-wolfenstein-the-new-order/","May 29, 2014","true","26.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/retroarcademonkey/recommended/201810/","retroarcademonkey","RetroarcadeMonkey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/retroarcademonkey/","728 products in account","Wolfenstein: The New Order is not a very intelligent game.  Neither were any of the Wolfenstein games, matter of fact.  I remember back in 2004 when I was but a child, my Pops let me play Wolfenstein 3D on my old now-gone computer with that old, late '90s computer monitor...it was one of the greatest gaming experiences of my life and I will never forget it.  Hell, I even bought the damn game on Steam just for memories sake.  Fast-forward to now, and I got the entire collection of Wolfenstein games, (except for Wolfenstein 2009) I finally played Retrun to Castle Wolfenstein and loved it.\n\nI actually didn't pay for this game.  While I was on vacation in America about a month ago, my Dad (being a fan of Wolfenstein 3D) bought The New Order for PC at a Gamestop, and after a few awkward moments relating to a drive-in ATM, we got back home and my Dad really wanted me to play The New Order too, so I could enjoy the game as much as he.  At first, we had no idea how to get the bloody thing on to my Steam account.  After a while, one little Google search got us to what we actually needed to do.  We had to link both of out Steam accounts just so I could play it, and it worked swimmingly!  And here I am, playing the newest entry to this series of Nazi killing, gun-toting adventures involving torture, the holocaust, evil....and of course, Nazis.\n\nWhen I first booted the game up on my newly purchased Alien-Ware laptop, it worked surprisingly well on my high-end gaming laptop.  The game runs of the Id Engine 5, which happens to be the same engine that ran RAGE, and looks a hell of a lot better than that massive disapointment of a game, but that's a game to review at another time.  The textures look all right, with some minor pop-in issues, but they're not too distracting.  The lighting's great and adds to the atmosphere to the overall game-world and works incredibly well in the areas where you are situated in castle-like enviroments.  And the character models look really nice and well-detailes along with nice realistic facial animations that totally don't have the uncanny valley effect at all, and I'm not being sarcastic either.  So yeah, nice looking game.\n\nAs I was playing the first part of the game thats set in good 'ol 1946, when World War II was totally raging on by that point in time, and I was having a rollicking good time blowing the Nazi's heads off while going nuts with a mounted machine gun.  The gameplay is satisfying, ridiculous and friggin' fun.  This game is Bullet Storm and Shadow Warrior levels of fun and stupidity, and it has that classic Wolfenstein spirit that both Return and 3D had all those years ago, but with a modern twist and it is glorious!  I have never, in all of my gaming days ever thought I would hear a video game character say "damn Nazi spaceman" but now I have.  And what FPS lets you old two shotguns in both hands while blowing Nazi's heads off while guiding an angry scotsman out of a prison cell?  Not Call of Duty, that's for damn sure.  And the health system!  My God the health system!  It's like Quake all over again!  Not only can you only get health back from medpacks, but you don't have to do that stupid tactic that modern FPS games have been making you do for years; the stop & pop tactic that you seemingly have no choice but to use.  Here, in Wolfenstein: The New Order, we don't do that stop & pop crap here.  We actually respect the player's intelligence and expect the player to explore the map, find health packs to stay alive, and be hardcore.  Health only regenerates a small iota of your health and that's all.  No hand-holding and no arrows on the screen telling you where to go on this ride.\n\nSeriosuly, I could go on and on about how happy I am about the old-school health mechanic, because I have been complaining like an old man saying "Back in my day, we didn't have these fancy-pants regeneration systems and cover...we used out bare-boned skill and wits to fight the enemy and take back Mother RussI-" and so on.  Another thing I absolutely love is how you have practically no limit to the amount of weapons you can carry.  You can carry as much weapons as you please except for the heavy mounted machine/lazer guns.  It's been years since I have played a game where you have no limit to your arsenal...no limit to the amount of killing machines that you would have in your inventory.\n\nAnd then there's the story.  It's a very basic alternate history game where the main character of all the Wolfenstein games; B.J. Blazkowicz fights his way through a castle in 1946 to kill a man named Deathshead, who is a sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that was the villain from Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and with Blazkowicz's not killing that evil dude, there are now evil Nazi robots that are totally helping the Nazis win World War II and now it's his duty to finish the job.  Blazkowicz finally bursts quite rudely into Deathshead's experimentation chamber after a lot of Nazi killin' where he slices guys' backs open and burns them for some reason.  Then, after a surprisingly short boss battle, Deathshead puts Blazkowicz in a situation where he has to choose between a Scottish dude and a young pansy to get sliced up.  Blazkowicz chooses one of those two and sees how evil that dude Deathshead really is.  Blazkowicz and whomever he let live then break free of their bindings and jump out the window with a big kaboom behind them.  Blazkowicz then takes a savage piece of shrapnel to the head and falls deep into the sea where some nice Polish people come to pick him up and take him into a mental institution so he can chill out for the next 14 years. That's the basic gyst of the story and the rest of the game is a bunch of dumb fun.\n\nThe New Order also features music.  Throughout the game you can collect songs that are German dubs of famous songs from the 1960s and they are really good.  I actually bought most of the songs on Google Play and you can look up the songs specifically made for the game if you're interested.\n\nI love this game and is one of the most unique first person shooters that I have encountered in my gaming travels and is truly an amazing experience.  If you have the money and are planning on purchasing this game, I reccommend you buy thisgame right this second...or wait 'till it comes down in price, I don't care just....buy it!\n\nThis game is an amazingly stupid joy-ride that respects the player's intelligence, and that's why I reccommend Wolfenstein: The New Order.","June 21, 2014","true","46.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's beautiful, it oozes atmosphere at every turn, it humanizes characters that you'd think would be blank slates, the action is intense and there's tons of freedom in how to fight, and it's somehow a game that took a concentration camp level completer with crematoriums and made it not just pure shock, but actually a very well done segment, and the villians are legitimately compelling and people you grow to hate.

The enemies are all nazi's so if you are jewish you should really get your money's worth out of this. The nazi mind controlled dogs are wicked and the big ♥♥♥ nazi robot death machines are awesome. You can sneak up behind guys and knife kill them or blow your way through them with rifles, shotguns, and so on, even a sweet version of the rail gun.

And while Wolfenstein: The New Order may not be the most original what-if, it is a very well executed one. This game (sort of) continues the story of "Return to Castle Wolfenstein" and 2009's "Wolfenstein", showing a post-WWII world where the Nazis won. After being out of the action for 14 years, you have to shoot your way through hundreds of Nazi soldiers and giant robots in an alternate 1960, in an attempt to end the evil regime that has now conquered the entire world.\n\nPros:\n-An excellent representation of how the Nazi Empire could have spread after WWII\n-Amazing graphics\n-Fun and challenging gameplay\n-Engaging Story and interesting characters\n-Partially destructable and very detailed environments\n-Epic soundtrack, especially for the final chapter\n-Tons of collectibles\n-You get to kill lots of Nazis, and you feel like a badass doing it\n-You get to kill Nazis on the moon, because why not\n-You can duel wield almost every weapon in the game, because again, why not\n\nCons:\n-There are no objective markers, which normally is fine but the game occasionally fails to send you in the right direction\n-The weapon wheel is a bit awkward (I've occasionally pulled out a knife in a giant robot fight)\n-The bosses are a bit too easy once you know how to beat them\n\nOther (not necessarily positive or negative):\n-The game has 2 story paths. What path you go on is decided from a choice you make at the beginning. The missions and story are mostly the same on both paths, the main change is that some of your allies will be different. Usually this is just a cheap trick by developers to increase the time it takes to finish the game, but in this case there's enough of a difference to justify a second playthrough.\n\nOverall, this game is definitely worth your time and money if you're a fan of high-action first person shooting. It took me a little under 8 hours to finish one story path (total of about 15 hours for both).","December 30, 2015","true","25.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You will see some Unreal engine style texture pop-ins, which is a shame in this day and age, however it runs very well and for what it is the game still looks good and has some very nice visuals.  Levels have some level of destruction; at least of cover so there is that upgrade, pillars, barriers, certain types of metal sheets can all be gradually broken and shot through different methods.  There is a minor cover system, akin to FarCry 3’s system where you can pop out or over something if you get into the correct position which helps during combat.  There are modeled and skinned in damage indicators for enemy troops, and given that this is a iD game expect some gibs, limbs, some pretty brutal cut scenes, and fair quick but significant take down animations some are quite visceral.\n\nThere is a stealth mechanic and depending on your play style you may simply favor running and gunning which, given the fact that you can dual wield almost every weapon in the game you have enough firepower in your hands.  However if you wish to avoid as much attention and fighting as possible, or you enjoy watching the stealth kill animations then you can, at times it’s more beneficial to do so as a fair amount of the enemies in W:NO pixel hunt or are just extremely accurate even while running or moving around.  However stealth wise they tend to be both blind or severely impaired, while at the same time incredibly hyper sensitive to anything and unfortunately the cause varies, the stealth over all can be very forgiving, which is good because there is NO QUICK SAVE!  That is unfortunately correct, there is no quick save in this PC game, I do not understand why this was not added in but the actual developers Machinehead Games really screwed up with this omission.  If you die part of the way through an engagement you will probably not be able to start where you’d like and sometimes you have to do entire sections over again, other times the auto save places a spot right after.  You will need to learn from your mistakes or trial and error it unfortunately; however there are only a few sections in the entire game where I can honestly say that I had trouble with.\n\nThere is a leveling up/skill tree system for this game and for the most part it flows quite well.  There are requirements that you have to meet in order to move onto the next branch or in order to meet a requirement for a skill that is not actually connected to a previous skill.  These vary from performing take downs, throwing back grenades, killing a certain amount of enemies while dual wielding weapons, silent kills with throwing knives, and so on.  Some of the requirements however are for the most part nothing but grinding and putting yourself into situation that you would normally not put yourself into AND the game very rarely actually uses this kind of attack which defeats the purpose of requiring it, so you will have to find work around for these unfortunately.  Luckily the forums on Steam are fairly helpful and I know of two skill points that I didn’t know if I would be able to do them that I was actually able to pull off fairly easily by cheating the system, but not actually cheating mind you, simply the description on many of them is vague and the requirements can be met in different ways then what is actually written in the game.\n\nOne other major fault is the totally not old school mechanic of having to manually pick up items one by one.  Picture this, you’ve expended your assault rifle ammo and you’re in a semi arena still rife with bad guys, well in W:NO you need to crack open boxes and constantly be looking at the floor for dead bodies so you can rapidly press your use key in order to pick things up.  I can not understand what they were trying to do with this; I can maybe understand it for the gold items, intel and other collectables but NOT armor, health and ammo.  This gets worse when you have to fight the last boss, since every enemy in the game has pin point accuracy you have to continually run and “dodge” in order to juke his shots and on top of that you need to scramble around looking for health, ammo and armor pick ups in boxes and frantically press your use key in order to pick them up.  I have to wonder if Bethesda had anything to do with this choise since, as I recall, you picked up items manually in many of their games; the difference being however that unlike say Oblivion you are not dodging bullets in frantic fights.\n\nThe story and characters are pretty well done and there is a single point where you make one decision that will alter what doors you can interact with and that is all, there are no alternative story arcs.  This is fine because the story is fairly good, at least when compared to past Woflenstine titles, the characters and B.J. are the main focus of most cutscenes as well as minor story additions when you are back at the main base.  B.J. is far more fleshed out in this version of him then in any of the past games, while he may seem to be just a muscle head they make him out to be fairly intelligent and kind.  Each side character has their own story line and you will get bits and pieces of it as the game progresses which is a welcome addition as it further fleshes out that person.  While nothing ground breaking happens during these lulls in the fighting it’s defiantly a welcome addition.\n\nThe weapons feel and sound quite good and the skill upgrades add some flavors to them that help in dealing with some of the more heavily armored enemies.  Though speaking of enemies some of the armored human units like the shotgunners are just damn annoying and practically a mini boss, their shotguns ricochet off surfaces and do insane amounts of damage in a short amount of time.  There is usually one extra attachment for each weapon, though one in particular has several through the entire game.  The real benefit to the skill columns is that you can gain all of them and go back and start a new game, getting the benefits which will enable you to play with a different playstyle then you would have before.\n\nBoth the sound effects and the music are very fitting for the game type, the weapon sounds are very good and have a plenty of oomph behind them, the shotgun being one of my favorites, it sounds like the part.  The music was actually better then I expected, and it changes from stealth to active engagement when stealth is broken.  Each level has its own music score and they all sound very different from each other, sort of giving them even more of their own personality.\n\nBeing a Wolfenstine game the developers saw fit to go back to the roots and added a fair amount of collectables, gold items, intel, music, letters and audio logs.  If you’re a completionist then you will get some extra hours trying to fine every single item, which for me added to about 36 hours total play time.  Granted this game is only single player thus some people may say it’s not nearly enough content given how large the game really is, 40 gigs is never something to sneeze at.  There is some talk about adding a few extra levels, maybe multiplayer or something; however it is all just hearsay.\n\nFor $60 full price I might be hard pressed to suggest a game like this, however given that it did give me 36 hours, it’s not a hard sell I would say however that if you are at all on the fence about the price versus the content then I would wait for a sale, after that it will be well worth it.  Either way I had fun with it and I hope they will continue in some way, this also gives me some hope as to what Doom could possibly be like.","September 2, 2014","true","36.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The thing that got me for this was the trailer and the hype.\nOkay, now to the game, the game is rather fast paced, which could have you sneaking around picking off enemies, or dual-wielding your way through the gates of whatever lies ahead. I enjoyed the game, I would say it has replay value, and it has around a 13-16 hour campaign. I feel as if the campaign was greatly developed, as well as the characters. The characters dont have much of a backstory honestly, but they dont feel like useless NPC's who take up space.\nA few downsides towards the game of which I have found are; The AI is a bit derpy, they don't see you most of the time (though i only played on medium so could be an advantage), and other than that, the price. The game is a great game and all, but a $60US/$80AUD pricetag is a bit pricey for a game like Wolfenstein. IT IS a good game, but the price is rather over the top. But it was easy to find cheaper around the net, so if you're thinking of getting this game, get it, you wont be disappointed.","May 30, 2014","true","24.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpecialistWolf/recommended/201810/","SpecialistWolf","Specialist Wolf ((RAGE))","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpecialistWolf/","367 products in account","I have been a fan of Wolfenstein since the first time I ever played it. I started mostly with Return to Castle Wolfenstein, pretty much the godfather of FPS's and worked my way through the games as I could to the, I think, 2009 game that some people didn't like, which I may say I did like.  Now let me get this out of the way and this is mostly just a heads up for some people, I bought the retail copy so I got disks, the box had 4 disks in it, which I thought was weird for a 40+ gig game and for good reason, if you get the retail copy you will still need to download 10+ gigs, I think it was like 10.7 or something, I cannot remember.  I understand some people may not have a problem with that, but I had to wait an extra day just to play it.  This may not even be a problem for most people though, unless you have download limits or what not, just a heads up. Now to the review.  As most people that have heard of this game know its about the Nazis winning the war and classic hero BJ is there to kill Nazis.\n\nThe story is pretty good, although don't expect it to be the best thing ever written. It is very good and unlike most war focused games, this one actually shows the civilian cost, and the effect people have with the Nazis in control.  The gameplay is fun and I felt tactial at times. Most levels you have the choice of how to engage, there are certain units that if they spot you they will call in reinforments, which can be a pain.  So you can either go guns blazing and take out everyone, or take the stealth routine.  I tended to be as stealthy as possible, but when spotted went guns blazing.  Also this game has a perk system which is kind of cool.  Each of the trees has different slots, all can be earned by doing a certain challenge such as get so many headshots, or kill 2 people with one grenade.  There are a couple trees to earn each skill for and once earned never go away, unless you start a new game.\n\nThe AI was kind of buggy at times, not anything that bad to where the game couldn't be played or wasnt fun, just sometimes guards would be looking straight at me and not set off an alarm or shoot at me, but other times the AI would work together to murder me.  I played through the game on the medium difficulty so I could get a decent challenge but still be able to beat the game without raging.  The guns are fun and some can get upgrades which just make a great gun even more fun to use.  If you like collecting things then this game will keep you around for a while.  Of the collectables I can think of off the top of my head you have: Letters written to different people which give you cool histroy and sometimes tips, Gold items that are just around, and the last I can remember are code fragments.  If you get all the pieces of one code you can then decode it, through trial and error, paying attention in game I think there are hints in some levels, and the internet.\n\nThe reward for finishing the code? Unlocking a new game mode adding more replayablity to an already good game.  I have around 11 hours or so in the game and finished it in 2 sittings, but decided to give my laptop a break after 9ish hours straight.  The game also managed to have some humor and have a serious tone and some sad moments.  The only really challenging part of the game for me was the final boss fight, I would say much about it but after dying a few times you should figure it out like I did.  I had the settings on Ultra and it looked pretty amazing. Do the side missions also, they arnt listed as missions but if you see them you will know what I mean, and explore every region you can because you can find some cool stuff hidden around. As a big fan of the Wolfenstein series this game was great and kept the old school feel which i miss in most modern games. I highly recommend this to fans of the series or fans of FPS's in general, also there is no MP in case you were wondering. I loved this game, also I get access to the upcoming Doom beta so thats a huge plus too.","May 25, 2014","true","19.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Been a Wolfenstein fan from childhood.\n\nMachine Games has managed to mix modern shooter features with the old for a very convincing experience. Solid story line and character development, Wolfenstein NO brings the FPS genre backs to its roots with fast pace action based around combat intensity, excitement and less hyper realism that has overtaken the entire genre as of late. No more ducking for cover every five seconds to regenerate your health. Wolfenstein NO makes good use of HP and Armour pick ups that allows the player to feel more apart of the story rather than just a bystander.\n\nI can't rave enough about the gun play in this game, amazing gun selection and design, almost every weapon can be dual-wielded. A good variety of weapons that all have different uses which help foster and encourage different play styles eg. stealth or open combat. This game has put to rest the argument that every FPS must embrace a multiplayer feature. While I hope due to the success of Wolfenstein NO a standalone multiplayer is developed in the future that echos the Enemy Territory model of earlier Wolfenstein games, this game easily stands tall on its singleplayer features alone.\n\nWith multiple difficulties, different characters and a meaningful collectibles feature that unlocks four very unique gameplay modes, this game has plenty of replay-ability and could easily be enjoyed for many playthroughs. I don't normally like DLC but I really hope this game gets some side mission or extended story line DLC and fingers crossed a sequel in the coming year or two.\n\nHats off to Machine Games for crafting an enjoyable singleplayer FPS in an era where everyone is obsessed with multiplayer and for standing by their development goals till completion to produce a solid product. Props also to Bethesda for backing a  studio with great talent and vision. Hope you enjoy this game as much as I did.","June 4, 2014","true","36.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I play PC games since 2000 so I'm not a old-school PC gamer, but I played many classic old-school PC titles released in the golden age of PC Gaming-1990s. Though, I have never tried the classic Wolfenstein. But when I play the New Order, many features reminds me of those classics. The first time you enter the story line in difficulty selection, you will smile. The intro movie, the way you kill a nazi, the way you restore health, the story, the combat...the more you play, the more you satisfied. I'm not a English speaking guy so I can't really express what I feel about this game in English. But if you a classic-FPS gamer played from 1990s you will know The New Order bring back the old feeling when the first time you play Wolfenstein in 1991 and the first time you play DOOM in 1993 and Quake in 1996. Old-school First Person Shooters. But The New Order isn't just old-school, it learns a lot from many other good FPS titles. Examples like: Double hands shooting, slidding, covering system, gun mods, throwing knives, destructable environment, lots of fun collactables, and it even offers two different story line!\nAfter all, it give you a a lot of enjoyable contents to play, for a classic-FPSer.\nThe bad thing is, there is no multiplayer mode. I really like to have coop mode in the campaign just like Rage did. I'd like to have some fun TDM maps, shoot run and take cover-what you have done in singleplayer. In my opion, many single elements in this game worth to be made into a good multiplayer mode.Some of you guys may have problem running this game smoothly, but what you need to do is just to turn down the shadow resolution. that's all.\nThe New Order is worth a try for every FPSer. The graphics is good, the shooting feedback is great just like every id-Tech engine titles. The background music really brings the atmosphere, the sound is ok(since BF3 i feel every other FPS sounds bad). id-Tech 5 engine may not look so amazing comparing to CryEngine3 or UE4 and some others, but it looks good and offers very imersive atmosphere, which what i feel most since Rage. Some people may get bored that The New Order (in fact the id-Tech 5 engine) can't not push their ultimate gaming rig to the limits, never mind, you just relax and play it. You will find fun and enjoyments in it.\n\n简单一句中文，德军总部：新秩序是我近年来见过的最有诚意的FPS续作，不静下心认真体会下它是你的不对。","June 28, 2014","true","69.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The gunplay mechanics are tight and very fun, with great diversity in the play styles and a skill-tree system that is as flexible as you are, and one that really compliments your preferred play style (if you don't just choose them all). Machine Games have really pushed idTech 5 far beyond the capabilities shown in RAGE, making this game a sight to behold. The textures and models are highly detailed without dragging down your framerate - I can play it on nearly full specs with a 4 year old Nvidia card, and the atmosphere of the game is thick and immersive as they have used that capabilities of the engine to compliment the game in all the right ways.\n\nThe game does toe the line of modern shooters in some ways that border on negative - specifically, the opening scene is great to play the first time, and then a drag upon replay as you go through the motions, but this is the only criticism that I really hold, and it's a minor one at that.\n\nHighly recommended to any FPS fan.","July 31, 2014","true","36.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You will see some Unreal engine style texture pop-ins, which is a shame in this day and age, however it runs very well and for what it is the game still looks good and has some very nice visuals.  Levels have some level of destruction; at least of cover so there is that upgrade, pillars, barriers, certain types of metal sheets can all be gradually broken and shot through different methods.  There is a minor cover system, akin to FarCry 3’s system where you can pop out or over something if you get into the correct position which helps during combat.

Where should I start? The plot. The beginning takes place during WWII, which should not be a surprise to anyone. Like in previous games, you play as a B.J. Blazkowicz, once again with a goal to finally kill "Deathshead" Unfortunately the assault on his fortress ends up with a failure, you lose your squad and find out that 20 years passed by and nazis has taken the control over the world! It is your job to at least try, to do something about it, if it's still possible that is.\n\nDuring the game, you'll visit various places, even the concentration camp in which you can experience the particle of suffering from people that are held there. You can hear them talking about their families, how they got seperated from each other, etc. In RTCW you had castles, secret laboratories, catacombs, etc. and if you actually thought you saw everything, and it can't go further than that, then bruh... you haven't seen anything yet.\n\nThe game looks and plays great, even on my crappy PC, with the lowest details it looked really good and still gave me a lot of fun.\n\nWhen it comes to music, it's really good, but to me, there's only one track that truly stands out. Unfortunatelly it plays once and very late into the game, but when it plays, man.... Chills all the way down the spine. You did a great job with it, Mr. Gordon. Hats off.\n\nSometies you get to choose the way of killing the nazis, that is when the "signal detected" message appers in the upper-right corner. It means that there are commanders around which can call for support if they find you, you can eliminate them one-by-one and be sneaky-peaky, or just say BRING IT ♥♥♥♥♥! Rush forward and vaporize everything that breathes. Personally, I recommend the first way in later stages, especially on higher difficulty settings. Overall when it comes to gameplay there's nothing wrong about it and your weapons can be upgraded too (f.e. your assault rifle can shoot rockets!).\n\nBut of course there always have to be some flaws, here's no exception. It took me 15 hours to beat the game on "Bring em' on" difficulty, which seems preety short to me, also some of the later stages follow the similar scheme. Kill nazis in a big hall or something like that, move through corridors and tunnels, kill nazis, move through tunnels and repeat till the end. The game also lacks bosses, there are 3, maybe 4 in total, which wouldn't be bad, RTCW had the similar amount of bosses, but here, they all appear near the end! I almost started thinking that there may be no bosses at all! Who doesn't like to take down the giant mecha and make some noise from time to time? The worst thing about this game is the ending, the motherf**king ending which just begs to be different, and i don't understand why it ends in such a way, it could easily be different, why they decided to put out something like this, I have no god damn idea...\n\n*SPOILER WARNING* If you haven't beaten the 15th chapter - don't uncover the text below!\n\nThere's one moment in the game, that I remember the most, earlier in this review I mentioned, that one song stands out of the entire OST. It plays in 15th chapter, it's so beautiful and fits SO PERFECTLY, that i don't know how to describe it. It fills you with sorrow and anger that can be satisfied only when all the nazis in your sight will bite the dust, as you walk through the burning remnants of your destroyed past-HQ, knowing that your friends are dead or captured by Deathshead... I have to say, that this might be the first time, when I got touched while playing a video game. And it comes from a guy who gave no sh*t about the ending of "Angel Beats". Anyway, the song is called "Ransacked".\n\nTo sum up, I'd love to give this game 10/10, but I can't, instead I have to give it 9/10 because of the flaws I've mentioned above and the price this game's asking for. 50 Euro is too much in my opinion, so just wait for the discout and then pick it, you won't regret it. I f*cking recommend this game to everyone, despite some flaws it's still an amazing game that will blow your balls, or boobs. And I can see why TB picked it as "The game of 2014."","July 8, 2015","true","16.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spinalfluid/recommended/201810/","spinalfluid","spinalfluid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spinalfluid/","481 products in account","This game encompasses old and new, a throw back to the health and armor system that seems to have been lost on most shooters these days. The gunplay is absolutely fantastic, it feels smooth and fresh like it did in RAGE but better in my opinion, I haven't felt this satisfied with a shooter since Half-Life 2: Episode 2. The sounds and music transitions with the cut scenes are absolutely beautiful and the voice acting is really well done.\n\nWith hints of Tarantino style story telling, the game pulls you through both sides of the spectrum when it comes to feelings and responses, like a rollercoaster of rage and punishment. I can safely say this is the first time a game has really put me through a process of "Oh god that is awful, why am I looking at this" to "I really want to rip that persons head off" It's a game that, to many, doesn't seem to take itself seriously, but it does - in its own special way. It's a hard thing to go into an alternate path of history and for it to be taken seriously. While Wolfenstein The New Order may miss it at some points, it nails it to a cross on a frequent basis. While I was playing I constantly was thinking about the story and how it seemed to be an analogy of insanity & rage. The level of absurdity you go through was extremely satisfying, you get the feeling that its completely ok to go over the top to wipe a Nazi out, that you could not accept that they became such a power and you would do everything to wipe them out with no remorse.\n\nI'm currently going through the second playthrough at the moment. There is a point early on in the game where you make a choice and it ends up giving you a specific experience with characters because of that choice. You have altnerate methods of accessing locked areas, and new secret areas that you will come across, as well as acquiring weapons at earlier points in the game, all depending on the choice you make early on. It's an interesting twist to the game, and definitely can make a second playthrough worth it to some extent - may update when im finished with the second playthrough.\n\nOverall Wolfenstein The New Order didn't play the usual harp strings of emotion, it took its own path - while this path may not fit for some, I have a feeling many will really get a kick out of it, and find it extremely satisfying. I wish there was more to play, I really hope MachineGames continues to dig into the Wolf universe, this is the first Wolfenstein single player experience that I REALLY loved, even over RTCW (with the exception of its multiplayer ;p)\n\nalso MachineGames, if you're listening - get on the phone with Splash Damage and work with them on making Enemy Territory in this universe ;)\n\n-- I know many people are having issues with playing the game from a technical standpoint so if they are curious, I played the game with maxed out settings @ 1600x900 resolution and things ran smooth as silk for me, didnt even crash once, I was even live streaming the whole thing.\n\nSystem Specs:\nIntel 'Haswell' Core i5 4670k\n8GB Corsair Vengeance DDR3\nGeForce GTX 750ti 2GB\nOS Drive: 128GB SSD\nHD (where steam is installed): WD 500GB Sata 3.0","May 24, 2014","true","24.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OxiumPrime/recommended/201810/","OxiumPrime","Oxium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OxiumPrime/","291 products in account","Wolfenstein: The New Order is a blast. It really is, it has enough fun, wacky, and bloody moments to make it worth your while. Don't be deceived, this is not an old school game, it is very much modern, with lots of cut-scenes, iron sights, and linear level design to make Call of Duty eat its heart out. Does that make it bad? Not at all, in fact, it is a well done modern FPS well worth your time.\n\nFor your first playthrough.\n\nAfter that, trying to play it again, you realize how much fluff the game has, the amount of cutscenes and gameplay moments where you're not blasting through Nazi scum is astounding. There are intense moments of gameplay that will last from 5-15 minutes, with a level or two dedicated to full blown action or stealth just as you prefer it. In between all that is 30-minutes to an hour of doing a whole lot of nothing. Do you enjoy exploring sewer levels, finding lost toys for a character, or getting a sample of moldy concrete for research? It's all here.\n\nAnother big issue is the illusion of stealth vs. action gameplay, this was prominently advertised before the game's release. It implied that you would be able to go as stealth or Rambo First Blood as you wanted. For some levels, yeah, you can do that, but for most, not really. Sometimes your cover is blown right out of the gate, forcing you to go akimbo AR's and mow through lines of baddies. Other times you're so ill equipped to fight you really can't, and you have to go sneaky or face getting your arm ripped off by a genetically mutated robot German shepherd.\n\nFinally, lets talk about the Nazis, there's no Hitler to kill, lets get that out of the gate, and it sucks. The Nazis feel overly evil, and it doesn't give you the proper motivation to kill them. They feel like generic evil-doers that you have to kill in order to progress the story. Instead of an attitude of "business as usual" while committing heinous crimes, it's laughing maniacally as they hold you at gunpoint interrogating you, or flipping tables out of enjoyment as they purge a mental hospital. Don't get me wrong here, they do very much try to give you that feeling of genuine evil, but personally it comes off as a joke.\n\nAll in all, I like the game, I think it's fun for that first playthough, but once you see the horrible ending it gives you, and trying to play it again realizing how much fluff you sat through, it just isn't worth owning it. It feels like an awesome weekend rental, with lots of bloody action in between the cutscenes and quiet moments. I cannot recommend buying it for $60 unless you're the kind of person that enjoys watching a movie 4 times in a row.\n\n-Wrap Up-\n+Awesome fun at times\n+Satisfying and punchy weapons with great gore\n+Lots of near death experiences that make you grip your chair\n+For a modern FPS, it's a pretty good one\n+Moon Nazis\n\n-Lack of weapon variety\n-Horrible amount of fluff in cutscenes and quiet moments\n-Lots of performance issues and not a single patch as of yet\n-Cliche Nazis, with no Hitlers to kill\n-Not an old school rebirth of Wolfenstein\n\n-Final Opinion-\nGet it at a Redbox or Blockbuster and invite some friends. Treat it like a movie and you'll get the most fun out of it.","May 27, 2014","false","18.3"," 357 of 699 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","357","699","4","29"

Uh, lots of stuff, actually. But we're here for Wolfenstein: The New Order.\n\nSound: The voice acting in this is pretty good. You have the option to turn on"Foreign Subtitles" which, naturally gives subtitles to the German and some people with too harsh of voices. One thing that really annoyed me was that one of the character named Fergus, a Scottish RAF pilot, has subtitles for his lines, while a German woman speaking English does not. The sound effects are pretty cool, too. With good surround sound headphones like I have will make a fanatic and sometimes scary atmosphere. The music is the standard fare. Lots of heavy rock that is cool, but doesn't exactly fit. During the  game, you can find records of alternate history, German influenced music. With such hit's as Die Käfer's "Mond Mond, Ja Ja" from their album "Das Blau U-Boat".\n\nGraphics: Being one of this first "Next Gen" games, the graphics fail to impress. Running this game on ultra makes the game nice, but there is a huge problem. Every single time you turn around, the textures behind you de-load, meaning when you turn back too look at them ,  they take half a second to reload.\n\nGameplay: The Gameplay is as simple as it gets, folks. Shoot bad guy, take cover, reload, repeat. Simple as it gets, but stupidly fun. There are a multitude of weapons in the game that you are able to use. I feel like they could have added more cool weapons if they didn't take up 2 slots for guns, one for a single handed gun, one for dual wielding. With one weapon, you are able to trace out holes in fences, then go through. There is a stealth mechanic, fun but simple. The Stealth is just staying out of Nazi's line of sight and don't let the main guy sound an alarm. I actually enjoy the mechanic all though it's not super in-depth like games such as Thief II.\n\nPlot: Simple but cool. Our surly All American hero B.J Blazkowicz is taking part on an assault on a Nazi compound in 1946 where the Nazi's are winning the war (How they got AI, A Moon Base, and super cool laser weapons is never really explained so don't get your hopes up). B.J and his crew, including Fergus the Scott and a Private from the American army are captured by General Wilhelm Strasse, otherwise known as Deathshead. The General will give you the choice to sacrifice either Fergus or The Private. Choosing splits the game's timeline into two different outcomes, both very similar. After choosing who dies, you and your crew but outta there, but B.J suffers head trauma and is taken to an asylum for 14 years. Lots of interesting stuff happens but I completely lost interest when they added an element about Hebrew science fiction and ancient super technology. The ending, at least for me, was completely un satisfying and lame.\n\nFinal Verdict: This game is very fun, and really feels like a classic shooter. If you can put aside  it's flaws, Wolfenstein is a  fun and addicting shooter.\n\n8/10","September 12, 2014","true","137.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ducktales4life/recommended/201810/","ducktales4life","McquacK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ducktales4life/","134 products in account","This was a breath of fresh air. I was really happy that this game came out and I would put in my top games of 2014. As a fan of Wolfenstein, I couldn't help notice all of the old school things that they did in the game (even though I only played Return To Castle Wolfenstein). One of them are the secrets and duel wielding of the heaviest shotguns possible. Some of these things in the game really made me remember how fun and over the top an FPS can be. Wolfenstein is one of the pioneers of this genre. One of my favorite easter eggs in the game is the Wolfenstein 3D dream. I loved playing through that and thinking to myself, did the series ever lack a story? The answer is yes. The New Order has a big story with great writing, great voice acting, and characters that you can actually feel pity for. Some other great things that this game is top notch at is the combat. I found it to be very satisfying and I wished that more game took the idea of duel-wielding assault rifles because if you think about it, when fighting big robotic Nazis, it takes more damage. I also enjoyed the puzzles. You get a lazer gun in the game, which you can use to burn though wire and other objects with a highlight. As the game progresses, you can modify your weapons which I really like as well. The last thing about combat is armor. Whenever you kill an ememy, you can pick up their armor and take more damage in battle. But, it doesn't totally make sence, how would dog armor or big robot armor fit on you? Well, it's just a game and I don't really get bothered by it.\n\nA new addition to the series is stealth. If you talk about Wolfenstein, you never really think about stealth and when first thinking about it, I found it odd, but upon further inspection it's pretty useful when you're playing on Über (hardest difficulty), like me. It's also more logical since, you can't be a one man army, litterally killing all Nazis and them never being able to kill you right? I liked the stealth and I like that when you get spotted, they call the alarm and call in more enemies. If you successfully kill everyone in the level, that will never happen. If you playing on the easist difficulty, then stealth is not really that useful. The other nice addition is the way you want the story to be. Save Wyatt, or save Fergus. Whichever one you save, the story unfolds with the one you let live. But, there is not really much of differnce, I actually played the game twice to see the differences and I was a little bit dissapointed to be honest. I was expecting for the characters to say their dialogue differenty but they were too similar. The only real change is lockpicking a door. With Fergus, you hot-wire and with Wyatt, you pick the lock. But I won't expect anyone to actually play the game twice, I'm just telling you this as an interesting fact.\n\nA game is never perfect, and it always has it's flaws. One of them is how repetive some of the things can be. I don't like that everytime I enter an area, or open or press a button, the enemy jumps me and knocks me out, only for me to find myself in a different room, and later escaping again. I wish that they didn't take those cliches so high. Maybe it's just me, but I wished for not that to happen so many times. A huge problem I have with this game is the 60fps lock. Yes, I know 60fps is good and all but, when you have a person with not the most powerful pc in the world, you'll get lucky when it stays at 60. This also means that you can't even run the game on Ultra. I have a GTX 960, so I don't need to bother but I'm concerned for other people who also want to run the game on high settings at least. Apart from that, if you have no problems with that, then good for you. The last flaw is "film grain effect". When I was playing I believe that it had some film grain. For personal preference, I absolutely hate Film grain and I wanted turned off so badly,  but I couldn't find where. I was quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at that. But I still loved the game and I really tell my friends to play it and anyone else as well. These flaws were more personal for me, I don't think anyone agress but it's a great game. 8/10","September 27, 2015","true","13.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It's up to you, William Blazkowicz, to save the world and kick the nazis out of power.\n\nThe premise is good but the delivery feels a bit bland. I suppose they chose to stick to the classic FPS theme, omitting an overwhelming/complex storyline (which would've been better in my opinion). However, be warned, for W:TNO isn't all about shooting nazis, there's an unavoidable romance storyline that can make things a bit cheesy.\n\nGameplay\nThe game itself is pretty straight-forward. No secondary missions or time to fool around. There are two storylines based on who you let to live (Wyatt or Fergus), but they're pretty much the same, with the cutscenes being practically the only difference.\n\nGunplay is 100% pure, unfiltered fun. You can double-wield, throw knifes to insta-kill enemies and become death itself if you want to. While average nazis aren't much of a challenge, major bosses can be tough, so don't underestimate them. There's a couple of easter eggs and you'll be able to play a level of the classic Wolfenstein but with modern weaponry.\n\nSadly, there's no multiplayer, which is a bit outrageous since the game weighs 50GB, but still, if you like FPS and hate nazis you're in for a ride.\n\nGraphics/Soundtrack\nSolid sountrack. It can be both engaging and chilling. It does a fantastic job pumping you up for shootouts, so if you liked it I recommend getting it.\n\nControls\nCompletely customizable and 100% left-handed friendly:\nYou can use the arrows instead of WASD\nYou can use Enter instead of E\nYou can use Backspace instead of R\nObservations\nNo, you don't get to see Hitler (although he is mentioned). Yes, you get to have sex with Anya.\n\nBreakdown\n8/10 excellent FPS, lots of fun. I'm hoping for a sequel/DLCs in the near future.","September 28, 2014","true","56.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/201810/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Wolfenstein: The New Order is the latest main Wolfenstein game, a series of FPS games, which sometimes have very light stealth implented, where you shoot and kiss many Nazi and other fictional beings nearby. This time it was developed by MachineGames and published by Bethesda in 2014. Smartly enough, developers decided to focus fully on single-player, with no multiplayer modes. Otherwise it would have got hated by Return to Castle Wolfenstein multiplayer fanatics for not being same, who don't care about singleplayer campaign.\nGame was developed with Id Engine 5, also used in RAGE, and was also made for PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. There is no difference worthy to mention.\n\nFrom technical side, I must note that AMD cards users will have harder times with this game. I remember how it would lag hard and crash even at intro movie at launch day. Good thing I updated to official Catalyst drivers and it got fixed, so I could enjoy my low-end laggy experience. No, I don't mind, I am used to being behind the times tech-wise.\n\nThe plot in this game is quite exciting. The Nazis, thanks to Deathshead, one of villians in previous Wolf games who now takes a main anatogonist role, advanced far above the Allies forces in technology, taking a horrifying shapes. It doesn't take them long to win the war and soon you will be out there, fighting your way through the world rebuild in evil Nazi ideology and style in 1960.\n\nIt's also executed cinematic-wise, awesomely. Blazkowich is back to his square-jaw and he now has non-stop inner monologues which deepens him as character. World is potrayed in dark tone. Your only friends are often weirdos. It has amazingly directed cutscenes and jaw-dropping setting. I also liked how action jumps from one point to another, and game never dumps a lot of info on you, saying little to create a big picture. Also helps with tastefully placed newspapers.\nThough it does have a lot of shockers. Adult thing and all. But at times it felt that some shockers were there just to increase the rating really. And why main hero is totally cool with NPC drugging him with boiled water, not punching into face?\n\nYou also get to make choice between two characters in the beggining of a story: Wyatt and Feigus. Big deal it's not. It barely changes cutscenes and story, they say same general things in each line. Just depends on how much you want to hear F-bombs. Feigus "timeline" lets you find the permanent health limit upgrades, which is more useful than Wyatt's "how much each armor pickup gives" upgrades. But also each of them gives you ability to access certain places and Wyatt seems to have more of them. Oh, and a single another NPC is different for each story.\n\nOh yes, upgrades are part of collectibles that you can find during each chapter. And the thing about collectibles and perks is that they are saved in your global profile, so choosing chapter will not reset them. Not sure about "New Games" though.\n\nOh, yes, perks. Instead of grinding for experience, these work like achievements: You do some certain stuff, like kill 3 enemies without releasing fire button while dual-wielding, and then you unlock a small upgrade, which slightly makes it easier for you. All of them are categorized after certain playstyle, which should help you get better at what you like to do best. Though I just challenged self to get them all during main play.\n\nAnd yep, there are few playstyles. While you can't really beat game just by stealth or mayehm, it helps variety, lots of fun. You can stealth sometimes, which is quite easy and satisfying to melee kill enemies, but there are few situations where you are allowed that. Easier to take out commanders before they call reinformcement, but you can't stealth kill tougher enemies and then you just position to prepare for big fight.\nIt's kinda weak by itself though too. It may get old and there is supposedly-pro-stealth chapter with melee-only enemies who are more fun and easy to melee straight on.\nAlso, people silently insta-dieing because a knife landed on a heel of a shiny boot are still hiralious.\n\nThen it can be off to a straight-on shoot-em-all style. There is a huge variety of retro-futurustic weapons, all of which get upgraded slowly through the game. Yep, progress kept in global profile. You can also dual-wield two of same weapons, increasing your firepower. Can switch modes of each weapon individually. And game doesn't rely heavily on iron sight, so it's awesome.\n\nBut as game comes closer to the end, you will meet a bunch of tougher enemies, who have tons of health and will rip you apart at closer range. I also should note that levels, while aren't exploration maze, albeit still have secrets, have more than one way for a firefights, so you can flank. Or be forced to be more dynamic by tough enemies, as you have to move before getting into their death range. And thankfully, is has enough firefights that last a while.\nAnd not only that, but game has interesting first-person cover system. You hold down the button and can either lean left or right, or peek up above the cover, or even lay down to shoot some boots.\n\nHealth system is another thing that I find incredible. As you know, Wolfenstein are one of those hitscan-abuse games, barely any projectiles to avoid. And it's not fully about stealth either. So that makes fully traditional points health system fit badly, since you can't avoid random bullets. Regenarating health is better, but it allows you to fully recharge by hiding around cover.\nSo developers used a combination of those. You see, health system can be divided into sections by 20 points each, which can regenerate. So if you got 33, then it will come to 40 soon. And I totally dig this system, as it fixed both complaints that I can die anytime by random bullet because I have only 6 HP and can't fix from current position, while also making sure that I still feel that I screwed up if I end up hiding with 20 points, making me scavenge for health packs.\nSome say that it first was used in older Chronicles of Riddick, but I don't care. What I want is for it to be used in more hitscan-heavy games like this. So yay for developers for using this one!\n\nAnd I also should note how awesome this game is in audio-visual part. The art-style, with help of high production and some good game engine, as well as masterful usage of haze/fog and lighting, delivers some amazing vista that look like a concept art that came alive. Music, while used cinematically, meaning that there are silent and simplistic parts, still sets off great different moods and helps the experience. Like, get to final level and see and hear for yourself.\nNot to mentioning that there are enough variety and satisfying cutscenes to keep you interested and beat the game on a single breath.\n\nThere are also few more small details, like you can cut fences and special metal covers with your laser weapon or ability to pull the turret off the place, though you will have to either recharge it if you run out of ammo by placing it back, or just abandon it later.\n\nYou also can't help but to feel that developers really wanted to potray Blazkowich as tough as he is during gameplay itself. Probably to make you feel badass. This man can survive ten thousands stabs during cutscenes, so much that at some points you may stop beliving.\n\nWolfenstein New Order is an amazing game that combines the high-quality cinematics with high-quality gameplay, which is something not to be missed. It's also the first Wolfenstein that I can fully call amazing without huge flaw. As far as I am concerned, it's a FPS of the 2014 year, along with Wrack. Beat it at least once. Watch the trailers too, they are awesome.","November 29, 2015","true","26.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ovimatto/recommended/201810/","ovimatto","Cattail","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ovimatto/","210 products in account","Wolfenstein series is now over 20 years old and i begun my hobby around the same time. It's interesting to see the progress of two decades, but by the end of The New Order i felt like i just might give up on the whole FPS genre.\n\nPlot is dumb but not in a fun action movie sense. Enemies sure are cartoonishly evil but the rest of the world doesn't seem so bad. Tech has gone forward in great steps resulting in robo-dogs and such which are clearly not to be taken seriously. Then again you see and act horrible violence that leaves people as empty shells (literally) that is perhaps meant to provoke some drama. I wasn't having fun with the story but could not take it seriously either.\n\nGameplay is divided in two sections: On missions and at base. The base is where you interact with various characters who are visually well desinged and kind of interesting but the objectives you get there are "find a piece of moldy concrete" or "find missing power tool" and such. Even the main character complains about being "just like an errand boy". Still the characters and places are so well made that i liked those parts more than the shooting.\n\nEnemies can take a load of bullets, especially if they're armored, and on the hardest difficulty ammo is scarce. Corpse may only carry 9 bullets so spraying all over is not an option. Of course you don't come to Wolfenstein looking for realism since the name of the series itself has meant Robo-Hitler with two miniguns for over 20 years. Problem is that the movement grinds to a halt when you have to peek from behind a corner slowly firing off hitpoints of something that also only stands still. There are only handful of enemy types. Sure there are diffrent colors and clothes but all carry same assault rifle and behave in the same way. Then there are few types of robots and occasional boss but overall the variation is way too low.\n\nMuch advertised feature is that you can dual-wield every weapon and that certainly is the case, but the flip-side is that there are only six or so weapons in the game. Pistol, Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Sniper, Laser weapon/welder and occasional pick-ups like minigun. There are variants of all in different parts of the story set on different years, but i can't tell any meaningful difference between them. Basically what dual-wielding does is make the weapons fire at faster rate at the cost of iron sights. Since there are atleast two weapon options assinged on every weapon key and game brings up what you used last time, you'll more often than not get the wrong thing. For example at the later part of the game there are 4 possibilities of what comes up when you press number "4": Assault Rifle, Assault rifle's underbarrel rocket launcer, two assault rifles or two assault rifles with the primary shooting underbarrel rockets. So too few weapons but still too much to handle.\n\nThe laser/weldergun itself is interesting. It allows you to cut a hole in few materials. The desctiption says it will cut "thin metal" but you can only cut chicken-wire, chains and specific crates. You can't, for example, open barrels with it.  It doesn't even leave a mark. Theoretically you can make a hole in a thin metal wall and then shoot through that hole which is really impressive but since you are supposed to go guns blazing there is really no need to do that. The game also has a perk system that is almost unnoticeable. You get automatically a bit better at what you do. For example sneaking a lot gives you quieter footsteps, but during gameplay i didn't notice it at all. Enemies are almost blind anyway.\n\nWolfenstein is built on ID Tech 5, same engine as Rage. I personally like how many details are in the scene. Where is supposed to be a pipe, Wolfenstein has 5 pipes. A table has not one but 10 books stacked plus a pile of paper. I'd love to see this engine used in a game with more exploration, like Deus EX. Downside is that most of the objects are static so they cannot be moved and that is not good in explosion heavy game. Quality of the textures is sometimes nice and other times Half-life (the first) level and in totally weird places. Wall behind the most important button in the plot might look just awful and other not so important places look good. Wolfenstein runs smoothly even during action scenes but sometimes slows down in meaningless corridors without enemies. Again which is weird. If The New Order shines at one thing it's size: At 44gb The New World was the largest thing i have ever downloaded.\n\nOverall i didn't like The New Order. Everything has been seen too many times and all new things are under-developed. Don't belive the hype. It's often on sale and cheap but so is everything else.","January 4, 2015","false","14.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The tone is lighter and less bound by reality (and in some of the series, mysticism) than previous Wolfenstein titles. It’s a good reflection of the ultimate source material, Wolfenstein 3D. In summary, it’s really fun and seems to know it.\n- You can dual wield every weapon. Even knives and sniper rifles. See the above note.\n- Features returning for this game from the original include attack dogs, treasure hunting, and the ability to eat dog food. I can’t stress how fantastic this is for anyone (like me) who grew up with the original.\n- The game’s difficulty gradually ramps up, and only rarely does it become stiflingly difficult. It balances its pacing very well.\n- The levels are well designed and very creative. Additionally, the easter eggs like treasure, Enigma codes, and scattered articles, are plentiful.\n- I don’t normally notice the soundtrack for this kind of game, but this is an exception. I thought the soundtrack for this game was remarkably well done.\n- There is no multiplayer, and since I generally don’t invest enough time to get good but still feel obligated to play it, I only ever end up frustrated. So yes, this is a positive.\n\nThe Bad (all negatives have to do with the storyline so… SPOILERS):\n\n- There are points during the game in which I believed there was a lack of communication between the voice actors/writers and the director of this game. Particularly when B.J. is growling though his monologue of childhood memories, I had to remind myself that this is a game where I can eat dog food, dual wield sniper rifles, and infiltrate a moon base (in 1960, no less).\n- B.J. wakes up in an asylum after his first encounter with Deathshead, semi-conscious but unable to move, and remains unable to move for fourteen years. When he is finally able to get up and start the killing again, he’s still a mass of ripped muscle. I mean, this dude is a beefcake. But after not moving for FOURTEEN YEARS? Were they injecting him with HGH the entire time?!? Come on. Give me a montage where he brings himself back, something. There’s unrealistic, and then there’s this.\n\nWhile I’m picking nits…\n\nNot much this time. This game is remarkably clean. The only thing I noticed was that sometimes if I turn around quickly the game can’t keep up with which doors are open and which are closed, so there is a split second where there does not appear to be a door, then it appears. This happened infrequently however. No game breakers, no serious bugs. Machine Games QA FTW.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?:\n\nMy first playthrough took fifteen hours. I did not get every single unlockable, however, and there is a decision early in the game (it saves one character while killing another) that I would like to change and see the story from that perspective. So this game will probably clock in at 25-30 hours for me.\n\nRecommended Purchase Price:\n\nNot $59.99, but only because I am philosophically against paying the same amount for a digital download as I do for a physical product. I picked it up for $35 and was happy with that, but I’d have gone as high as $45.\n\nor\n\n75% of current retail value of $59.99\n\nReviewer: Rod Kimble\n\nA Quick Look at those Games you Might Buy:\nhttp://www.gamersglance.com","June 8, 2014","true","1.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Now ponder that for a moment. What you're playing is history. History that will hopefully be made again if the game sells well enough to warrant a sequel, and I do hope you buy this game because I want to know how it all plays out since the game ends on a cliff-hanger, the almost Half-Life 2 Episode 2 cliff-hanger.\n\nThis game is one of those ultimate male-fantasy games. It just nailed pretty much everything right. It is also a tale of revenge. You play as an alpha-male with a soft heart, you get a hot chick, you travel around the world and to the moon, you get some downtime there and there, you kill Nazis and robo-Nazis, destroy their accomplishments, unravel their secrets, inspire the resistance, etc.\n\nIt's a roller-coaster of a shooter with some old-school and some "new-school" mechanics that is outrageously fun, brutal, gripping that, after 16 chapters, will leave you yearning for more.\n\nI kept thinking about RAGE as I was playing this though (not even Bioshock Infinite came to mind). No wonder, this is still the ID Tech 5 engine which, sadly, still has ways to go in terms of rending the world around you with no texture popins (Ahem Rage, Ahem). I would also still like to see my legs. Otherwise, the engine delivers. Blown off heads, sometimes big set-pieces, multiple ways of approaching the target, tons of ricochet/explosion/smoke/bullets flying everywhere along with pieces of concrete whizzing by. I also love that this time (unlike in RAGE) you play as a character with a voice as well as inner thoughts. I always wondered why so many games out there fail to deliver on the inner narration when your character thinks of something or encounters something in the world. It took Bioshock franchise 3 games to finally create a memorable character (whose face you sadly do not get to see in the game, still).\n\nNow why do I mention Bioshock again? Well, I've noticed some subtle philosophy behind this game. The war is over, well, all wars are over now, nations do not fight each other anymore because there are no more nations. The technology put the man on the moon in 1951. There is Colonization of Venus is underway. Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Aeronautics along with Eugenics, racism, suppression, slave labor, camps. It is the New Order. All you see is conformity/normality and honest idealistic beliefs (probably reserved for Germans only). And then there is a third choice, resistance.\n\nAnd that's where B.J. Blazkowicz and his friends come in. Now how exactly did the Nazis manage to conquer the world and reach Peru? Well, play the game and find out. However, with all those bad things I mentioned I can't help but play a devil's advocate and ponder that in a few more generations of the New Order the assimilated people would no longer know of the good old days. Fast-forward few more generations and people would simply take the world as it is. A technologically advanced civilization the fruits of which are reserved for the top 1%. As you read letters written by the British they will mention that even though the war was lost they have now experienced 6 months of peace - without any terrorist activity, where they can walk the streets of London without being scared for their life. Now that's where the game is trying to throw the player off a bit, I believe. However, we have very little knowledge of how the outside world fares.\n\nI don't want to get too deep into this but I'll say this, buy the game, support the dev, and enjoy.","May 25, 2014","true","17.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","2"

My favorite Wolfenstein game is Return to Castle Wolfenstein, which is really awesome. So I am also gonna judge the game from what I liked in that game, that this one doesn't have. The gore is very good, very satisfying to shoot holes in the Nazis. The Graphics are also very good, but personally is not what I care about. The things I find bad about this game, is that BJ is portrayed like some emotional guy or whatever. That doesn't suit him. He also gets to be the boyfriend of a nurse who put him by a ♥♥♥♥ing window for over 20 mother♥♥♥♥ing years. In the other games, BJ is not given much of a personally he's as emotionless as the Doomguy. Which is what I liked, I like silent killers. His thing is killing Nazis, he does it for a living and he does it in his free time. He doesn't have time to moan over random people and have a ♥♥♥♥ing Polish Girlfriend. If you aren't a big fan of the older games then I am gonna recommend this one for you, I just personally miss the more basic "just shoot the bad guys" play-style. On top of that, this game is kinda short for being an ONLY singleplayer game. It took me around 4-5 hours to beat it the first time.\n\n\nEDIT:\nYes, I may sound like a "nostalgia ♥♥♥" or whatever you call it. But I think it's fair to compare it to another Wolfenstein game. If I compared this to let's say; "Petz 4" then it would be fair to call me a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥. I've based this review off what I like in FPS games and what I don't like.

My GPU is an MSi Radeon R9 280x 6GB Gaming and my CPU is an Intel Core i5-3570K so my rig is easily mig/high tier but even on lowest possible setting this game runs terriby. I did it all, I renamed WolfNewOrder_x64.exe to WolfNewOrder_x32.exe, I turned off the Steam Interface, I tried to run it as Admin and I tried other tweaks I found around the internet but nothing works, I still get around 20 FPS on lowest which makes the game really difficult to play. The only time I get 30FPS or over is when I stare directly into the muddy textures of a wall and sadly that's not how the game is supposed to be played.

Visuals are fantastic, gameplay puts you in the zone, the music is so solid and amazing it fits the mood for every situation whether you're mowing down enemies, exploring a location or picking a stealthy approach, this game has a good bunch of everything.\nHowever, one thing to note is the story. The entire premise is captivating, well executed and definitely makes you feel like the Nazi's are in power. But one thing is a small issue and is quite ironic: The story. While the story is there, it is good and puts you in the middle of it all, you forget the reason why you're doing anything you're being told on any point in the chapter. This is actually just a small factor in the game, as it immediately puts you back on track. Now where to start with the review...\n\nThe Premise: The Nazis won the war and they are definitely in power. Wolfenstein: The New Order executes every bit of this atmosphere so well it is scary. It almost feels historical! Except for the fact that they are extremely technologicaly advanced. Aside from that, this game is amazing when it comes to making it seem like the Nazis really do control everything!\n\nThe Atmosphere: Every mission and environment are different in their own ways both visually and game wise. They really put you in the situation and allow you to feel the weight of it all. Althought the paths you take can be very linear, the world is open enough for you to feel like you are really exploring. Among other things, the Nazis are also one of the biggest parts of this atmospheres(as if you didn't know already). They add a really good grim feeling to anything they're are around while also adding a nice touch of military strength. If the Nazis weren't as good as they looked, this game would be bland.\n\nThe Graphics/Visuals: Stunning in every way shape and form. Honestly, this game is Tomb Raider levels of good. Lighting, shadows, character models and texturing are all so well done. Some parts lacked like the Lunar Base and other textures but they never removed from the game. On top of that, all the Characters, Enemies and Robots look so amazing its insane. Every Nazi soldier looks awesome that when you kill them you can't help but look at them. Each character is also very well detailed that you want to stare at them.\n\nThe Gameplay: Very solid for a first person shooter, and it is to be expected. Controls for leaning might be a bit wonky but it is no biggy. It is as basic as you can get with controls. But the weapons and enemies is where the meat of it all is of course. You have a varied but formiddable array of weapons to your disposal and on top of that most of which can be dual wielded. They can be upgraded as you progress and allow for dynamic fighting. The enemies you encounter however are what determine what you should be doing. You could encounter a large wave of enemies and need some serious automatic fire power, so why not dual wield Assault Rifles? Heavily armored troops could jump in so mount up some laser weaponry. Enemies too far away? Marksman rifle. Don't wanna deal with them all at once? Grab your knives and stealth kill everyone. The vast amount of choices to engage enemies is surprisingly wide.\nAnother thing to expand on with this game is that you actually make choices, both linear and personal. The game can make you do small or large decisions that can ultimately change the game itself or do something to the immediate situation. Really good. And then you have engagement options which varies between stealth and destruction.\n\nThe Characters: All characters are voiced and designed well. Although they are not incredibly attachable they allow you to be immersed in the game. However, you don't actually get to see much of them unless you're in the safe house or "taking care fo the dirty laundry". Otherwise, characters are well done.\n\nThe Main Character: William J. Blazkowicz is a pretty awesome and badass character. Well voiced and well designed. No real backstory is provided, just his part in WWII. All in all, pretty good.\n\nWhat is BAD about the game?: Well first off, the game itself isn't actually that bad, it's just some things that take away from the experience. As said before, you forget the story all together. Sometimes frames might drop here and there but it's no serious issue. But one thing I find is actually lacking and that is difficulty. Honestly, the game wasn't that challenging until you reach "Death Incarnate" and even then it is relatively easy. I would highly recommend playing on "Uber" your first go. It will be challenging and it actually makes you feel like you're fighting a Nazi armada.\n\nPros -\n\n+Stunning Visuals\n+Gameplay is Fantastic\n+Dynamic Choices\n+Static Choices\n+Nazis look EPIC\n+Weapon array might be small but usage is massive\n+Atmosphere is superb\n+Really does feel like Nazis control EVERYTHING\n+Characters are well voiced and personality wise AWESOME.\n\nCons-\n\n-Story can be quite forgettable. You forget why you're doing this.\n-Frames can drop randomly and even freeze. Might just be me.\n-Difficulty really lacks. Play on UBER to really enjoy the game.","May 25, 2014","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You got burned by Rise of the Triad. We all did. Shadow Warrior was good, but everyone ignored it because Hard Reset blew and they thought it would be like that. This is different, though.\n\nThis is a full-on nazi-murdering masterpiece, a sequel worthy of Return to Castle Wolfenstein.

But then it keeps you there with the story. Who the ♥♥♥♥ expected that? Wolfenstein isn't about characters you care about, dramatic scenes, and an emotionally-charged soundtrack, right? It is now.

So I got curious, did some reading, saw that it's a Bethesda game and again almost ignored but said what the hell, for Doom I'll try it.\n\nMy first pleasant surprise came with the initial credits - Id is still alive and kicking!  Good for them (for those who don't know Id invented the 1st person shooter).  Then I started playing the game and wihle the idea of americans vs. natzi's has been a pet peeve of mine for a very long time, the story of this game was surprisingly well thought out and quite compelling.\n\nJust as improtantly, the graphics were quite crisp and the game play very fluid and engaging with interesting weapons and upgrades that were either unlocked through challenges or you had to keep an eye out to find as there is no "store" in this game.\n\nAll in all I really enjoyed this game and was sad when it was over.

The audio and visual feedback, along with the excellent animations and diverse enemy types all work in concert to provide a joyful shooter romp. And all this is made sweeter by the surprisingly fresh story. Whereas antiheroes and muddled morality systems seem all the rage in today's pop culture, WTNO returns to a simpler time, in which heroes are heroes and villains are horrible, evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥ whom I wanted nothing more than to see put six feet under the ground. The problem of ludonarrative dissonance (as seen in recent shooters such as Bioshock: Infinite) is not a problem here, because the player experiences firsthand, often in states of powerlessness, the atrocities committed by the bad guys, so often that by the time he or she is locked and loaded with akimbo, fully automatic shotguns, he or she is ready to mete out righteous buckshot justice. More than dull shooting galleries, every fight becomes an act of catharsis. This is why we crave better stories in games - not because of an appeal to some artistic standard set by film and literature, but because of the way it FEELS.\n\nThree-dimmensional characters, wonderfully despicable villains, a romance subplot that, as far as I'm concerned, is touching, and a seemingly meatheaded protagonist who, as you get to know him, turns out to be just a peace-loving country boy fighting for friends, family, and barbeques on sunny, suburban lawns.","January 3, 2015","true","35.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Wolfenstein: The New Order, while not technically impressive on the PC with its frame limiter, is a story-driven shooter experience you will not soon forget.\n\nid Software has done an exceptional job making you REALLY hate the antagonist Nazis in the game. Anything bad that happens throughout the story? It is directly the Nazis' fault. And that makes you, Lieutenant Blaskowitz, really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. Add some unique and alive-feeling characters on the good guys' side of things and a guitar solo of the US national anthem and you've got yourself a narrative that explodes with awesomeness.\n\nThe gameplay is quick and hands off, just aim at Nazis and start gunning them down. No cover system, no nothing to hold your hands against the teched up, excuse-free Nazis. Melee attacks are quick and satisfying and actually offer and advantage over just running and gunning in stealth situations which were a pleasant surprise when they were presented.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game if you are looking for an engaging first person story-driven experience with a required element of skill. If you're up to the challenge of ending a genocide and feel like you can pick up the role of the badass Lieutenant Blakowitz, pick up Wolfenstein: The New Order. If not, well then, just let the Nazis take over and see what happens, you sadistic prissy boy.\n\n","January 3, 2015","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mostly. The general premise (your character is in a coma for 14 years and wakes up to a world where the Nazis won WWII) works, largely because of solid storytelling and a fantastic art direction. Up to this point, BJ Blaskowicz's defining trait is being "that dude who kills Nazis," but Machinegames does a really good job of making him a belivable character thrust into an unbelivable situation.  Except for the romance stuff. Ech, that romance stuff. The various newspapers and decorations throughout the levels do a great job of establishing the world and overall tone.\n\nThe actual gameplay doesn't break any new ground, but it's really good for what it is.  The guns have a great feel and weight to them, the enemy types encourage a vareity of strategies, and the pace is fast and frantic.  There's also a stealth element, where the game often encourages you to silently kill generals in the area to prevent backup. This works most of the time, but not always - the AI has some weird quirks where sometimes it'll notice you from miles away and other times it has no idea that you're right next to it.  Also, the game loses some steam towards the end - they run out of new enemy types and the new environments just aren't exciting enough.\n\nI think some of the "surprise GOTY" talk is a bit overblown, but having said that, Wolfenstein is a great FPS with a surprisingly good story that stands above a lot of games in its genre. Recommended, especially at $20.","November 27, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(That isn’t a stab at the game at all!)\n\nI’m gonna do a simple Pros and Cons list for this game because I’d end up writing an essay about it. TL;DR located at the bottom.\nPROS:\n-  Genius ideas. It takes on an FPS style obviously but it keeps your interest for the entire duration of the game. The enemies are so creative and original that I was honestly curious as to what the game would throw at me next.\n-  Graphics. Are. Godly. There’s detail where detail wouldn’t even be necessary, helping to complete the atmosphere the game wants to create.\n-  Music. This is more of a personal thing but I personally loved the music. At certain parts too, it just knows how to get your adrenaline pumping.\n-  The STORY. I loved the story so much. I grew a love for characters and I grew an unrelenting hatred for characters too. If you want to have your heart cycle between loving the characters and experiencing extreme bloodlust, this game is for you.\n-  Weapons are pretty awesome too. I loved using the missile launchers, in the few instances that I could.\n-  The game knows how to balance between explosions, chaos, fire and death and the calm “just go around and explore” levels. It makes you appreciate both of them if you’re someone that gets annoyed when there’s too much of one or the other.\n\nCONS:\n-  If your computer isn’t the absolute best, this game will decimate it. Initially when launching the game (I can’t remember if it detects your computers specs and sets graphics accordingly beforehand) it was very de-synced. The video was slow and the audio seemed to had to repeat itself because the video was so slow. But after fixing the graphics so my computer can tolerate it, it ran pretty well.\n-  I don’t know if it was just me being bad at video games in general, but it’s pretty easy to get lost. The path isn’t given to you with a giant neon green arrow screaming “GO HERE.” The good thing about this though is that it sort of encourages you to explore more. Though when you explore everything you might get a bit frustrated. All the more satisfying when you make progress, though.\n-  Some of the robots can be a bit of a pain to figure out how to kill.\nHonestly though I can’t come up with many Cons. The Pros definitely dominated in my opinion.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nWould definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for something that will give you a satisfying feeling when you launch rockets and grenades and Nazis and see them explode all over the floor. The game bombards your senses with the most detailed atmosphere I’ve ever seen in a video game, and takes a pretty frightening and nightmarish idea and makes a badass game out of it. A bit expensive though. I bought it when it was on sale for $20, mainly since I don’t want to spend too much on games. A truly spectacular game. Took me out of reality for the time I played it.\n","December 13, 2014","true","30.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First of all, my playtime on steam is in no way represantative of how long the game is, as I completed it mostly in offline mode. To start, this is in my opinion one of the best FPS i've ever played. To start off, gunplay. The guns all feel powerful and fun to use, that combined with the fact that you can dual-wield pretty much everything in the game adds to how satisfying to use the weaponry in Wolfenstein is. Every weapon in the game has an alt-fire mode activated with C which essentially doubles the weapons in the game. The combat is visceral, enemies die satisfyingly and spurt moderate ammounts of blood, barely noticable amongst the havoc. The giant Nazi robot enemies add a good degree of challenge to the game aswell and they feel good to take down. There are many, many collectable throughout the game which can keep you trying to find them for a decent ammount of time. Surprisingly, the plot of Wolfenstein is quite enjoyable and gets quite dark in the latter half of the game. The game does have some stealth sections, but, also surprisingly, the stealth within the game is oddly enjoyable and it feels good to sneak through and take out a bunch of Nazis without being seen. Adding to this stealth element is the commanders. They broadcast alarms to bring in more enemies in the event that they see you or hear gunfire. This adds to stealth, meaning the player could go all out on a rampage, or take out the commanders for a more subtle approach. Wolfenstein: The New Order is an overall fantastic game and the best FPS of 2014 in my mind.","January 25, 2015","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Certain previous Wolfenstein titles were disappointing, and I wasn't sure whether or not the $60.00 price tag was worth it. However, IT IS. -- For the first time in a long time I was immediately gripped by the story set in an alternate timeline in which Nazi Germany defeated the Allies in WW2. Not only is the story amazing, but the graphics, mechanics, and overall bad-assery of B.J. Blaskowicz make for an incredible game that you won't want to set down. Wolfenstein: The New Order was the first game that I completed all the way through and was legitimately satisfied with in a very, very long time. I recommend this to ANYONE.

The 2009 title did nothing to fill in the gap between the legendary Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Enemy Territory titles, which were multiplayer juggernauts back in their day. Wolfenstein seemed doomed to fail and interest could never be lower, but perhaps that's what made The New Order one of the best shooters I've played in recent memory.\n\nThe New Order does so many things so very, very right, ranging from the tight, punchy feel of the combat to the stellar writing of its relatable and sympathetic characters, to the incredible art design of a Steampunk Nazi-controlled world, an intuitive and simple challenge-based leveling system, lifelike animations, cinematography that rivals many films of today, a lavish level design, collectables that are worth giving a damn about, and even an interesting early moral choice in the game makes it worth replaying. This game is tuned so tight in its' combat which alone makes it worth the price of entry. Weapons are punchy, sending enemies flying or satisfying limb dismemberment with a thunderous "thud" with a sound design that rivals that of Killing Floor or Battlefield 4, and the aiming is quick and snappy, making the gunplay not only a ton of fun but a pure, childish delight to blowing Nazi scumbags away.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising element of this new Wolfenstein is all in the story. The main story is nothing new, but its' the context and the characters involved that will stay with you long after the game is turned off. The acting and writing goes above and beyond the quality a shooter should have any right to have. The actors and actresses commit to their lines and roles with the emotion and gravitas worthy of an Oscar-nominated film, and the script they read from is so natural and full of sharp and thoughtful dialogue that it's hard not to want to stop and listen to what everyone in this world has to say, and that is a tremendous accomplishment for a shooter, let alone a Wolfenstein game.\n\nBut alas, The New Order isn't without flaws. Issue number one lies in the metastory. While the characters and dialogue are what makes Wolfenstein a cut above a lot of story-driven games, the main plot itself is rather unoriginal and unfortunately overused. The plot focuses on a resistance against an oppressing force, in this case being the Nazis, trying to topple their government and win freedom for all. Apart from a few key moments in the story, there are few to no surprises and that's just as disappointing as the rather abrupt ending.\n\nOne of the main guns encouraged to be used and upgraded throughout the game is a laser gun that requires stopping at recharging stations in order to re-use, which breaks the steady pace and flow the game tries to hard to maintain so frequently. What's even more unfortunate is that this isn't the only weapon to use this energy system in the game. There is also a unique mechanic introduced half-way into the game that lets you cut through fences which is novel, at first, but it quickly wears out its' welcome due to lack of further development of said mechanic. Another issue is that even though the game encourages you to play however you want to play with its' intuitive level-up system, trying to play a straight up run-and-gun action player isn't a very viable option due to the questionable choice of a classic health and armor system that makes it counter-intuitive to eat a lot of lead while killing a lot of Nazis. Finally, another unfortunate element that breaks up the pace of the game is the absurd amount of pick-ups of health and ammo you don't automatically pick up. This is 2014, we don't need to manually pick up ammo anymore, especially in a game that's supposed to offer the ability to run-and-gun through it.\n\nHowever, these last two paragraphs shouldn't stop you from experiencing Wolfenstein: The New Order, because despite the nitpicky flaws, it's an absolutely stellar shooter. It won't blow your hair back with originality or innovation to the industry, but it does its' genre so well that it's an effort that deserves to be commended and played. If you want an extremely well-polished and satisfying shooter which lets you kill Nazis, tug at your heartstrings, and give you more choice and flexibility than the leading FPS games in the industry, then this is a title you deserve not to miss.","July 18, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My only complaint is that the system requirements are a little high.  If you're looking for an entry that makes up for that boring Wolfenstein that came out in 2009, buy the hell out of this game.\n\nEveryone mentions the cheesy one-liners (which I'd like to point out only applies to the script, the voice acting itself is fantastic), but whole game is so over the top that they actually fit really well, so I don't know why everyone feels the need to point that out.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic!  I'm reminded of the first time I heard Brighter Death Now or Throbbing Gristle.  As if that isn't amazing enough, there's even collaboration from Fredrik Thordendal of Meshuggah!  It's all about making this dark, oppressive, mechanical reimagining of the 1960's truly come to life and the music accomplished that beautifully!","December 29, 2014","true","37.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As you're running through scores of Nazis with dual wielded fully automatic shotguns while listening to a fan-freaking tastic soundtrack you'll understand what I mean. The story is rock solid, it's no change you outlook on life good, but it's above average. The gameplay. as I mentioned earlier, is some of the best mindlessly fun FPS in recent memory, and offers a fair degree of challenge. The graphics are no Metro Last Light or Crysis 3 but they're good enough to not be a detractor from the overall experience, and it performs well, even though I believe there is a 60 fps cap, my hardware almost never dipped below it. (Considering the fact I have a superclocked 780, a 4770k and 16Gb of RAM I wouldn't expect it to) Overall a great experience.

In between rushing through bases and U Boats with dual wielded, full auto, ricocheting shotguns, it actually makes you feel involved in the story and care about the characters. Really tight controls, great level/sound design, satisfying gunplay and difficulty (played on hard.)\n\nCons: There are 2 timelines in the story based on a choice you make early on, but the difference between them isn't a massive deal. Not worth immediately starting a new game only to see the difference, unless you're wanting to play it again just to play it again.\n\nThe graphics are pretty underwhelming, especially considering the gargantuan file size.

No doubt the fans of RTCW and old RTCW3D will love the New Order. The core idea and story of the game is very attractive. Playing a WWII game is great, but playing the game in artificial "what if NAZI's won the war" world is much better. The mechanical robots, wardogs, devices and weaponry provides the player with unique atmosphere and the experience from the shooter is unlikely other RTCW I played before.\n\nI also enjoyed the no scripts waves of enemies. You need to shoot all the enemies in the area, you do not need to keep shooting until you reach a certain point in the game. On the other hand you can choose whether you approach your enemies with brutal force and fire power (where you usually do not run out of ammo as there are too many places with equip and ammunition) or if you choose a stealth way to clear the path. I am the stealth guy, so using throwing knives and silenced handgun is my way.\n\nWhat I disliked are the secrets. Enigma codes to collect, all the extras that you may come across, but you do not need to finish the game. I left too many behind and I do not feel like playing the game again just to collect them all. Thus I will not be able to open the extra modes etc. Also I lack the secret pathways like in the very old RTCW3D. There are no real hidden paths, no puzzles to solve. Everything is pretty simple as long as you crawl behined every corner. With enough time invested into exploration, you should not have a problem in discovery of all the secrets.\n\nAll in all it is a great game, I played it 'til I completed it and I rate it 7.5/10","December 28, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is the best fps I've played in some time and for a single player game that quite an accomplishment.\nStart to finish Wolfenstein is a rollercoaster ride packed with adrenaline and never gets stale.  The pacing is excellent providing intence gunfights with optional stealth.  The stealth in particular is such an achievment considering the games roots as a fast paced shooter.  The game lets you play your way and if you go the stealthy route everything is just as exciting as if you went guns blazing yet stealth is rarely required.\nThe world is fantastic.  I love alt history games and this one does it so well placing the whole world at the feet of a Nazi superpower.  All the characters feel well suited to the world and are voiced excellently by actors with some real character behind their voices.\nAs I said I just completed Wolfenstein and I can't quite sum up all my thoughts on it right now but if you're on the fence just go ahead and buy it.

This game is great. The cutscenes are amazing and don't distract from the gameplay. I also appreciate that the developers give  the option to skip any one of them, which comes in handy when you replay the game. Believe me, you will be replaying it. Initially I found myself skeptical of the Nazi tachnology and construction, but as the game progressed, I started being enveloped in the world. It feels almost claustrophobic since there is nothing but concrete and steel, as well as the hulking threat of the Nazis always looming. The game has emotion and heart, and I truly believed this is a labor of love from the developers. The ending was not as satisfying as I had hoped, and I wasn't all that keen on the plot's reasoning as to how the Nazis attained all of thier amazing technology (a jewish cult? really?). Other than that, the gameplay is great. The sound effects are comparable to Battlefield. Weapons really sound beefy and have some punch. The game is loaded with little details scattered throughout the world which add to the narrative. I personally loved seeing all of these little stories and newspaper clippings, and think that they further draw you into the game's world. You are given information from the Nazi and resitance perspective. The characters are unique and very interesting, each with a detailed personality that you find yourself wanting to know more about.\n\nI could write a book as to why you should by this game, but I'll just stop there.

There's a very cohesive mixture of the classic mechanics with a few of the newer staples added into the mix to really flesh out the shooter experience in Wolfenstein: The New Order. You can carry as many weapons as there are & dual-wield most of them, you have a classic health & armour system with an added touch of 10-20% health regeneration (Subject to upgrades, perhaps difficulty too, but I can't be certain of the latter yet), you can move & sprint very fast, you can aim-down sights while maintaining a classically accurate & reliable hipfire, and you can sprint & crouch-slide at quite some speed, whilst having a peek around cover mechanic for those occasions you choose not to perform the bulletstorm dance.\n\nAnd one of the most shining traits of the gameplay is the ability to choose between complete stealth or complete carnage or even both for the majority of the game's chapters! The fantastic level design allows the player to formulate a plan or find alternate routes to silently take down the humourously, but not tension-breaking awareness-lacking Nazis, kill Communications Officers to allow you to go loud without them able to call for backup, or just plain throw brains out the window and run around guns fully blazing at whatever dares throw themselves at you.\n\n\nOtherwise, the game sports:\n\n- A very fine-controlling shooter for both mouse & keyboard and controller (especially the former) with fully rebindable keys & several controller layouts\n\n- An FOV-Slider that goes from 80-100 (so no fear for those who suffer with low FOV).\n\n- A fantastic aesthetic design which makes better use of the grey & brown colour palette than many whom have made that colour palette notorious\n\n- Many secrets & collectables to further encourage & reward exploration including Nazi gold, Enigma Codes that unlock additional game-modes such as Hardcore, Ironman & Walk in the Park mode when solved, written letters, weapon & armour upgrades and even German-covers of classic music including The Beatles & The Animals\n\n- An interesting yet disturbing world where the Nazis won World War II\n\n- A story far better written & constructed than I'm sure any Wolfenstein fan would expect from a Wolfenstein game that can last you 8-14hrs (depends on how little or much you like to explore or interact with other characters), even if it doesn't exactly fly high in standards among other games.\n\n- A surprisingly more human BJ Blazkowicz along with a potentially likeable cast of characters, even if a majority lack significant development or interest.\n\n\nSo even with the game having confusing graphical settings and currently being subject to performance problems for a small number of people, which I have personally not encountered, I fully recommend this game to any shooter fans out there with 50GBs to spare on their hard-drives looking for a real good time with a single-player first-person shooter.","May 26, 2014","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fact that it released on my birthday, and Wolf3D was my first FPS furthered my hopes, wishing for something more than the gimmick of the 2009 game. I pre-ordered my copy with just a couple hours left, loaded it, and waited.\nThe plot works, and while sometimes BJ's internal monologues feel a tad forced and unnecessary, I felt that the game itself had a nice balance of gameplay and story. The addition of being able to choose how to go about a majority of the missions (either guns blazing or stealth) really sealed the deal for me. While I've only played it through once, I am gearing up for another playthrough to see if I can unlock more things, and also explore the other 'timeline'.\n10/10, highly recommended if you want a Nazi-killing game.\n\nP.S.

Initially, there were a slew of technical problems leading to desktop crashes and making the game nearly unplayable due to the checkpoint system. After a few weeks, the problem was patched, and I must say, the experience went above beyond anything I could have imagined.\n\nTo take a game so devoid of plot like Wolfenstein and a character so lacking in depth as B.J. Blazkowicz and create such a fantastic story and cinematic experience is one thing. But the experience itself is action packed, the stealth is tense and fun if you choose that route when available, and the gameplay is just seeped in all the proper elements of old school shooters while utilizing first person in a way I haven't seen any other game do so well.\n\nIt took a formerly silent protagonist and breathed life into him, immersing the player in his shoes and surrounding him with characters you'd genuinely care for and antagonists you love to hate. Uber difficulty is challenging, so no worries there if you're looking for a bit of masochism like me. The graphics are breathtaking and the locations vary significantly in this bleak, alternative-history Nazi killing dystopia.\n\nThe folks at Machinegames have outdone themselves. They absolutely deserve a chance at a sequel. I for one would be quite happy (and relieved since it seems like it's in development hell) if they went over to id software and helped them out with Doom 4. They know what they're doing, and they delivered a reboot I didn't know I wanted until I played it. 10/10","July 2, 2014","true","27.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fallacyboy/recommended/201810/","Fallacyboy","Valn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fallacyboy/","175 products in account","I'm going to start by saying that this is probably the best single player FPS game that's come out in quite a while, mostly because it's so well balanced in terms of gameplay. You can run-and-gun while dual weilding ‒ sliding around and dealing wads of dps ‒ take the usually optional stealthy route that prevents reinforcements from arriving, or simply play it like a cover based shooter. Typically you'll end up doing whichever one is most appropriate for the circumstance you find yourself in, but the option to do any of them is always there and usually always viable. The guns are freaking huge and pretty damn satisfying to shoot, the terrain that eneimes use for cover is normally completely destructible, and the stealth is rather intuitve and effective. It does all three styles well rather than just being a big brown puddle of boring and ineffective mechanics like most shooters that try to give you different gameplay options.\n\nThe story is pretty decent, with a lot of fairly memorable characters and an interesting take on a Nazi ruled planet. The dialogue and plot are what happens when you mash a gritty comicbook and an over the top action movie together. It's rather likable, but if you're looking for something with some semblance of realism then you're in the wrong place. Also, there are some pretty humorous parts of the game where the characters basically acknowledge that you're probably the most effective soldier to ever live, and the character interactions are normally not whiney or depressed in nature, they're more dynamic than that. They'll bicker, berate, tease, jest, laugh, cry, talk, complain, and do basically anything normal people would do with one another. It's definitly not 2 dimensional or anything.\n\nIn terms of fidelity it's decent but not fantastic. There are a lot of textures that just seem off, one that really bugged me was how pens and papers are actually just 2d parts of the desk textures. Speaking of textures, most of the non-cover and weapon textures are pretty poor, but to be fair they're hard to notice since you move around so much. Other than that there's not a lot to complain about, but ‒ then again ‒ there's not a lot to really praise.\n\nLastely, I'd just like to say that the levels and environments are really important parts of any FPS, and this game definitly has a lot of variety and good design when it comes to them. If you're worried that you'll be stuck in a brown corodor shooting faceless white guys in grey uniforms the whole time then you can relinquish those fears. You get to go to some pretty cool places and do some pretty awesome stuff. It's part of the whole ludicrous plot I was talking about earlier.\n\nThat's it. I hope that you found this at least slightly helpful. I can't tell you what you'll like, but I can at least try to give you a decent idea of what to expect. Whether or not you like what you hear is up to you, of course.","June 29, 2014","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I'm very glad he did.  His opinion (and what he heard) plus the trailers really got me excited for this title.\n\nMy thoughts about Wolfenstein had been colored a lot by its previous title, which was ok, but nothing more... so I wasn't really interested.\n\nBut after playing a couple hours into it... it's reminding me a lot of the somewhat recent Tomb Raider title (without all the crafting nonsense, mind you).  They've made Wolfenstein into a triple A title - worthy of that branding.  It feels like a movie that you play along in.  There are some lengthy cutscenes, but they're pushing a story that you want to see.\n\n[Edit:  The storyline and characters!  Wow!  They did a fantastic job in putting effort into them.  Specifically the characters.  You grow to like them and want to hear more about them.  It's very enguaging and was the primary reason for me to wanting to continue to play to the very end.]\n\nThe maps are very well done - complicated enough so that you can explore, but not enough to get lost.  There are parts of the maps where you're given very satisfying power to exploit if you wish.  Then there are others areas where you feel the proper amount of presure pushed upon you, as you would expect in the overwhelming presence of the Nazi army.  Which leads me to my next point...\n\nThe stealth system.  They've attempted to put one in this game... but it's rather hallow and not fleshed out.  You CAN be stealthy one some missions, but on others you're simply forced into fighting.  Regardless of your best efforts to go unnoticed, you'll somehow be found and they open fire upon you as any typical AI would - no confusion, no reports going between your foes on your current location.  They simply know where you are, and move towards you like dogs during supper.\n\nThere are collectables to search for.  Some unlock more total hit points for you, some for play modes, and some just for simple achievements.  Some of these are well hidden.  During my first play through, I missed a bit more than half of them, and I was actively looking for them as I progressed.\n\nBut enough details... in summary... this game has good graphics, sounds, gameplay, and maps.  The only adjustment I would wish for would be smarter AI.\n\nI would give this title 4/5, or 8/10.  Overall the single player was impressive, but lacking in AI (sorry, but Fear kind of upped the bar on this).  I would definately recommend this title due to the other fine things it has to offer.\n\nI purchased this title for $30 (during a sale, if you recall) and I feel it was almost worth that amount.  If you can pick it up for cheaper, you would be wise to do so.  My ideal pricing for this title would be between $15 to $20.\n\nAlso, please be aware that if you're looking for multiplayer, this game doesn't have any (which I'm grateful for after the previous Wolfenstein).","June 29, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had originally expected a shallowly made shooter, but I was give something with incredible depths. I felt the strings of my heart pulled at certain point in the game.  The gameplay was fast and challenging at parts sometimes making you take a step back and reassess your strategy(Which isn't a bad thing).  There were several ways to approach every scenario and through a currently in progress second playthrough I saw different even more places I could have done something different. Definitely giving you a different taste.\nWolfenstein's story was spectacular. I honestly expected something more akin to the old one, but I was given something very different and loved every moment of it.\nThe game does have some issues, but I didn't find many contrary to many reports. The graphical settings were a little odd and vague. Raising it drains the system, but makes it look incredible crisp.  Yet, the lower settings it ran very smooth and looked quite nice despite.  I did notice some audio desyncs at some cutscenes, but there were not that many of them. I found turning off Vsync fixed a good few of them. While, it was a little rough around the edges there, I only had some issue that affected gameplay.  Some soldiers spawned within a wall which wasn't that big of a deal and it was the sole occurence of it however.","July 3, 2014","true","25.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A few trivial criticisms though which you do get used to: you end up pressing 'E' constantly to pick up weapons, ammo, armour and collectibles, bit of a juggle if you're trying to our-maneuver the enemies through crouching and sliding around (I'm playing with WASD and mouse as you should do!) - personally I just changed the toggle crouch button to one on the mouse and forgot all about sliding etc unless otherwise prompted. The other issue is the speech levels - hard to hear over rapid fire and explosions etc. I had the subtitles on but found it difficult to read unless I had pre-cleared out the room of enemies.

Controls and interactions seem natural, do not have to do button mashing to achieve objectives.

Did have to mess with the FOV, the narrowness is not me. The controls did have to modify to excute the dash slide more naturally.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichieroki/recommended/201810/","ichieroki","darkfire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichieroki/","63 products in account","Wolfenstein: The New Order is a great "rebooting" of the series.  While technically not a total reboot, the developers have talked about how they are trying to take the legendary series in a different direction.  And to be honest I think it is for the better.\n\nInstead of having zombies and "magic" they have replaced that with more of a futuristic Sci-fi feel, but not with aliens.  Machine games makes use of an underground Jewish thinktank to produce these crazy technologies.  While probably just as likely as alien visitations being the reason for the Nazi technological advances it feels more realistic somehow.  Machinegames also really went out of the way to remind us about how terrible the Nazi's were.  Even including some pretty hardcore scenes and references that even someone with a basic WII history knowlege will recognize.  The actual story though is pretty bland.  While I feel like they did a good job building up BJ Blazkowicz(the character you play), through flashbacks and his mid level muttering.  They basically left out developing all of the other characters around you.  And the actual story was basically a terrible action movie.  In fact just think Bourne Identity and you will probably be pretty close.  That all said though most players are not going to be playing this game for the story, but instead for the gameplay.\n\nWolfenstein is a welcomed return to a simple shooter.  By that I mean it was a great single player shooter experience with really just the basic extras we have come to exepct and nothing else.  It seems like recently all I have played is a bunch of open world, RPG elemented infused, huge perk tree, squad based shooters, or some combination of that.  And while those games are all good and there are reasons that adding those elements to the FPS and even 3rd person shooter games, sometimes I just want a return to a game that resembles those old classics.  And that is what Wolfenstein really does well.  It was almost a welcome relief.  Now the game does have a perk system, but instead of giving you points to level up it just gives you perks based on your preformance in the game.  There is only one real choice in the game and to be honest it doesn't have that big of an impact on the experience.  There a little more than a half dozen guns and almost all can be dual wielded as well as having alternate firing modes.  The actual shooting, gore, and graphics were up to par.  In fact because my computer could handle it, Wolfenstein on the PC actually is a really good looking game with great effects on the highest settings.  Although playing on the PC it sometimes had some pretty noticable screen tearing and such, however that could be due to my specific setup.\n\nUltimately what really sets the game apart is it's ability to be both a stealth shooter and a rampage style shooter.  The player can play as either and I didn't really feel like there was a penelty for playing as both throughout the game.  Sure I didn't unlock the top perks but I got to play the levels how I wanted to.  This execution is really rare and I want to commend Machingames for executing this.\n\nWell if you have read this far I congradulate you.  Basically in the end Wolfenstein is a damn good shooter.  But the bar has been raised so high for games that only are single player shooters that I can't really say this game is worth 60 bucks.  This is mainly because of it's lack of narrative, character development, and immersion.  Maybe 5-8 years ago this would have been a no doubt about it recommendation.  But today this is almost a pass because of titles like Bioshock, HL2, and others.  I would say that if you are an older FPS player like me and you are sick of these modern shooters you will totally enjoy this game.  If not maybe just pick it up on steam sale.","May 24, 2014","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mostly. The general premise (your character is in a coma for 14 years and wakes up to a world where the Nazis won WWII) works, largely because of solid storytelling and a fantastic art direction. Up to this point, BJ Blaskowicz's defining trait is being "that dude who kills Nazis," but Machinegames does a really good job of making him a belivable character thrust into an unbelivable situation.  Except for the romance stuff. Ech, that romance stuff. The various newspapers and decorations throughout the levels do a great job of establishing the world and overall tone.\n\nThe actual gameplay doesn't break any new ground, but it's really good for what it is.  The guns have a great feel and weight to them, the enemy types encourage a vareity of strategies, and the pace is fast and frantic.  There's also a stealth element, where the game often encourages you to silently kill generals in the area to prevent backup. This works most of the time, but not always - the AI has some weird quirks where sometimes it'll notice you from miles away and other times it has no idea that you're right next to it.  Also, the game loses some steam towards the end - they run out of new enemy types and the new environments just aren't exciting enough.\n\nI think some of the "surprise GOTY" talk is a bit overblown, but having said that, Wolfenstein is a great FPS with a surprisingly good story that stands above a lot of games in its genre. Recommended, especially at $20.","November 27, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cmkoller/recommended/201810/","cmkoller","cmkoller","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cmkoller/","267 products in account","Wolfenstein: The New Order is one of the most satisfying single-player FPS's I've played in a while. "Single player" is a big keyword for this one because there is no muliplayer to speak of, which is almost unheard of for the genre. Yet, the decision seems to have ensured a game that grips from beginning to end of its campaign and feels thoroughly worked and impeccably designed. That's not to say it doesn't have issues, just that those issues are the result of a little too much care rather than too little.\n\nSome have said this is a game where the story and presentation have taken precedence over the gameplay, and while I disagree with them it's obvious this game has almost Kojima-lite focus on narrative that's uncommon. For the most part, it's an incredibly solid narrative, especially for a shooter. Your protagonist Blazkowitz may be a cartoonishly square jawed military stereotype by design (big shades of Brad Pitt's Aldo Ray in Inglourious Basterds) but as the game goes on these cartoonish elements intermingle with a sincerely compelling and at times emotional story of human beings turned to military machines through an endless decades long war. Reconciling both of these elements can be a little problematic, but if the game tries to throw a little more meaning into the fact that you've blown away hundreds upon hundreds of soldiers than is quite earned, this is made up for by the fact that the game still can make you feel for its supporting cast. You've got an incredibly diverse group of folks that are all quirky and cool in their own ways, and some truly grotesque, awesome villains, and this makes the story elements work incredibly well.\n\nThis extends beyond the game's cinematics into gameplay, and this is where you see Wolfenstein's presentation really shine. Firstly, the production design's absolutely marvelous. On a technical level you've got some strong iconic designs with masterful shape language, which helps immensely when you have to see what mechanical monstrocities you're about to take on. Level designs are distinct and the layout has plenty of thought for different ways to approach combat situations. At times, especially early on, the game can seem excessively linear and CoD-esque with its cinematic moments, but when combat starts, and it goes on for a while, it's surprising how much thought can be put into shooting Nazis. Generally, I started stealthy, knifing and sniping all I could until the inevitable discovery, and then the game got gloriously chaotic, with lasers, rockets, dual-wielded lasers and assault rifles, and grenades flying all around. The return to health kits over recharged health is very welcome, as now you have to charge forward to actually win combat situations when you're in the red as cover affords no take backs from poor choices. The game also lets you overcharge health if you pick up extra med kits, which offers the level of thinking whether you want the boost or to save it for an emergency.\n\nI also have to really praise the sound design in this game, as it's just awesome. Yes, every gun is satisfying and bass-y, the kickback really works in this game, but in addition you'll have some really effective story driven choices. Take moments of death where a split decision has to be made, and the foreboding music that kicks in, seeming to rise as the danger gets closer. Or take some really interesting underwater and outer space segments where sound is drowned out almost entirely from within your suit. Take the moments where a subdued acoustic track plays, then builds to a fully orchestrated version of that track as the really impressive stuff starts happening. It's all super smart and kicks the game's storytelling up a lot.\n\nIf I have one complaint that kind of puts a damper on all this wonderfulness, it's that the game spreads itself a bit thin. Engaging as the narrative often is, it can just as often be episodic and jarringly paced, as you find yourself jumping rather suddenly into levels without any clue how you got there because you blinked for a second during a cut-scene. There are also a big number of loose ends that I imagine are being saved for some theoretical sequel. I also loved things like the incredibly brief shootout on the surface on the moon, but these scenarios are so brief that I found myself wanting the gameplay idea to be pushed into further, more complex territory. Imagine the tactics of regular combat without sound and reduced gravity.\n\nBut that's nitpicking, if you've been starved for good first-person shooting this is your fix. There are no mediocre RPG elements dragging it down like Far Cry 3, and there's a shocking amount of soul to go with it. Plus its incredible visual and audio elements and it's a complete experience and the rare AAA title that gets it right.","March 11, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For its type, I would say it easily rates a strong 5/6 rating, where six out of six are Half-Life(1-2) and Modern Warfare(1)\n\nStrengths:\n+ The gameplay rewards exploration in an organic, almost old school manner.\n+ Controls for weapons and movement are tight and very responsive.\n+ You get to kill nazis, by the dousins.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Graphics\n- Internal consistency\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. In my mind there are really two flaws that prevent top score. And while it may seem odd and out of character coming from me, my first comments concern graphics, the second comprises the authenticity, or internal consistency, of the story being told.\n\nGraphics. While the character models, and indeed motivations, are wonderfully rendered-- panoramic views, or really any of the wide-angle shots, leave much to be desired. Particularly when compared to other idtech games like Rage and Quake4, which have both delivered jawdropping panoramic visuals.\n\nFrom personal preference, I would say that the aesthetic design of the Nazi warmachinery, ranging from combat drones to larger war machinery, also leaves me cold and uninspired. This may be a leftover homage from the previous games of the series, neither of which I am particularly familiar with, but from a personal point of view, the concept art could be much streamlined-- which leads us to my other concern.\n\nInternal consistency. It may seem odd to criticize the internal consistency of an over-the-top action shooter, but my point is not that the game fails to  replicate Arma, it is that the game plays sloppily with the 'setting realism,' and therefore authenticity of story it presents. Certain plot elements seem improvised, the plot characters response to wounds are inconsistent, and the handling of plot elements (read high-tech military vehicles/weapons) seems ad-hoc and poorly thought out.\n\nContrast this to the games that earn top score. Modern Warfare, while hardly a realism game, applies its concepts consistently. Half-Life, presents a set of concepts, AND STICKS WITH THEM. In essence, these game feel authentic, even if they are not realistic, in a pedantic sense of the word. Now vehicles moving at 'the speed of plot,' are hardly new to the genre, I just prefer consistency to wishy-washy-handwaveium.\n\n\nConclusion:\nNeither of my points of criticism are dealbreakers. Wolfenstein: The New Order, is a good game in all the ways that matter.  Its a good game, but not a great one. MachineGames is a studio to be watched in the future.\n\n5/6-- well worth the playthrough.\n\nKen","July 12, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wasn't expecting much with this when I originally heard about it given Wolfenstein's lackluster history after Return to Castle Wolfenstein and the tendency of Bethesda published games to be mediocre at best, but I was proven wrong. If there was ever a prime example of the statement "Don't judge a book by its cover" for video games, this is it.\n\nThe story is very engaging and somehow manages to make hating Nazis feel new again. The characters on both sides are very well written, and even B.J. still feels compelling as a character outside of brutally murdering Nazis. The main plot is very interesting and solid. Besides maybe a hiccup here and there concerning jumping to different levels, it's very coherent. The overall tone and style of the plot is what I would describe as Bioshock Infinite meets Metro 2033. The entire campaign lasts for around 8-10 hours, and that is without trying to look for all the secrets hidden in each level. Not to mention there are 2 branching paths to choose from.\n\nThe visuals are great. Not really eye melting and some textures and effects could be better, but the overall aesthetic is astounding. The annoying visual anomalies present in the only previous idTech 5 game, RAGE, are no longer present for the most part. Maybe some popping in textures every so often, but it's not nearly as jarring as it was with RAGE or some Unreal 3 games.\n\nThe sound design and soundtrack are great as well. Weapons are just a joy to use with the sounds they have. The Nazis sound authentic and are in no way cheezy. As for the music, if you're a fan of the new Killer Instinct reboot, you may recognize the stylings of Mick Gordon in the gameplay tracks. The songs range from moody and atmospheric to intense and thrilling. Even though some of my friends jokingly refer to the more intense tracks as "Nazi robot dubstep", it just feels right in this game and I quite enjoy them. There's even some German covers and re-imaginings of famous songs from the time period given a Nazi Germanic spin to them. While you probably won't hear them much throughout the game, it's a nice touch that most game developers wouldn't even consider.\n\nThe gameplay is tight and precise as with any idTech shooter. If there's one thing idTech based games always get right, it's player input. As alluded to earlier, the weapons are a joy to use. They feel powerful and weighty without making the game feel like a chore to play. The game is also quite unforgiving on the hardest (Uber) difficulty. Even will all the upgrades you can obtain throughout the game, it always presents you with a challenge.\n\nThe only thing I would've liked to see with this game is a multiplayer mode. I can understand it not having one given how immaculate the campaign is, but the mechanics are so solid and fun that it almost seems ridiculous to not have it.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about this game is that I don't think it's worth $60 USD. I know that's more Bethesda's fault than the developers, but I feel this game would be more suited in the $40-$50 price range. Anytime that it's on sale, I wholeheartedly recommend getting it though.\n\nOverall, I very much enjoyed this game, and it's pretty much set to become the GOTY for me in 2014. This game shows that an old concept can be quite reinvigorating and fun if it's just given a little polish here and there.","July 19, 2014","true","19.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I wouldve preferred it warned me first before sending me off, but I'm going to play through it again for the diferent branching paths anyway.\n\nThe ends of missions end somewhat weirdly in how they just drive away from a bunch of nazi killing and sabatoging, and are able to make it back to their hideout, which is in the middle of the city surrounded by oblivious nazis, every time they go out. You would think that since the nazis rule the world, that they wouldbe able to just keep forces on their tail so they would never get back to their hideout, but yadda yadda videogames.\n\nOverall it is a very fun game, with nice collectables, gunplay, interesting story and characters, and it was nice that they gave some depth to the 'ol block head B.J.

I remember "Return to Castle Wolfenstein" but paid little attention to it,  But I heard a lot about the competitive mod "Enemy Territory"\nAnd then that mod team created Quake Wars: Enemy Territory that was Epic enjoyment.\n\nInstallation\n40GB in size download.  Wow, this was huge and, with a slow internet speed, took 5 days to download.  Standard Steam installation after that.\n\nGraphics\nPretty good.\nDetailed scenes,  Human faces were top quality and the hair was short but always well-crafted.  Animation was well-crafted ad very smooth.\nBut the big caveat is the texture pop-in.  Every time you rotated your field of view, the textures would pop-up and were horribly blurred. Every.... time.... you... turned.... Disconcerting with flashing doors and objects.\nAfter some time, I adapted to the texture pop-in and got on with the game.\nThe art direction is excellent with a Fallout 50's feeling to the metallic creatures and machines.\n\nGame-play\nOf all of id software's games, this is the one with the best story, and a very compelling back-story.  Taking on the what-if possibilities of a world where the Nazis won was very exciting.  The guns were above average and there was an extra adrenalin boost when you dual-wielded weapons.  The set-pieces were interesting.  The bang-bang was usually challenging enough and at the correct level.\n\nOverall\n\nVery good.  I've slowed down in completing it because I want to extend the fun I am having.  I was able to get past the texture pop-in and enjoy it thoroughly.\n","July 23, 2014","true","27.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/merlinpants/recommended/201810/","merlinpants","MerlinPants","http://steamcommunity.com/id/merlinpants/","200 products in account","This is the closest thing to a flawless game I have ever played.  Each aspect of it is perfectly crafted, whether it's the story, the gameplay, the characters...\n\nLet's start with the story.  It is 1960, and the Nazis have won World War II.  Everything we know about the free world has gone to hell and been replaced by a horrifying vision of what could have been.  Down to the tiniest details, such as a Nazi-style Beatles album, or letters recounting the war, this is a fully fleshed-out world, and each twist and turn of this fast-paced tale hits you hard and makes you feel real emotion for what is happening.  The setting and the level designs feel fluent and fitting in this grim reality, as do the look of the soldiers and weapons.  There is a ton of background information you can discover about it as you progress through the campaign.\n\nNext, the gameplay.  Very much in tune with the original Wolfenstein games of old, The New Order feels like the perfect mix between modern and classic.  The health system makes each leap from cover to cover suspensful, as you have to keep finding health packs and hidden rooms to stay alive as the futuristic soldiers fire at you.  Also in vein with classic shooters, you have access to every gun you pick up at any time throughout the level.  This leaves room for a lot of variety as you mow down evil soldiers.  Yet, despite these more retro aspects of gameplay, the shooting and sprinting feels fast and responsive.  Not once did I feel like I died because I was too slow, or got stuck.  Also, almost every gun you pick up will get upgraded as you progress, adding insane features to your favorite weapon.  Now, the one thing that was a little lacking was the stealth.  It feels a little like it was added last minute, after they had designed the game to be a fast-paced shooter (which it is), and sometimes it can be annoying.  But, it is still possible and very fun to sneak around and silently pick off guard dogs or commanders.  In addition, The New Order has a very cool perk system, that unlocks new abilities as you carry out actions or takedowns in-game, and you can progress down a multitude of skill-trees, such as stealth or melee, or shooting to name a few.\n\nFinally, the characters.  Good god, the characters.  Each one is a shining gem, sticking out uniquely in their own ways.  They too, interact with the world around them, and have great dialouge/voice acting behind them.  You begin to feel a bond with your friends, and an immense hatred for your ruthless enemies.  Every nazi boss or major character is different, and by the end of the game, you will want to kill every last one of them.  All of this character development is backed up by secret letters you can collect that talk about the characters, or audio logs that you can unlock.  Nobody in this game feels flat, especially not your character, B. J. Blazckowicz.  He is not the traditional, remorseless first-person-shooter protagonist at all.  He feels regret, or sympathy, or disgust, or hatred.  He too interacts with his surroundings and turns an already great game into an excellent experience.\n\nAll in all, you should definently play this.  It has really changed the way I view first-person-shooters, and I feel like now I've been spoiled by this wonderful game.\n\n","July 26, 2014","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Coming from the team responsible for games like The Darkness and The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, I had very high hopes for a polished shooter with a riveting story. I can happily say I was not disappointed; from start to finish, Wolfenstein: The New Order is expertly crafted and memorable in every way.\nYou are BJ Blaskowics, US soldier and steadfast killing machine, tasked with the elimination of General Deathshead. Standing out from previous game, BJ's character is extremely well characterised and likeable, supported by strong voice work and character movement/modelling. All of the characters in this game have excellent voice acting, and this really supports the role of the villains in the game; characters such as Frau Engel and Deathshead were memorable because of the terrifying non-combat encounters reminiscent of scenes from Inglourious Basterds.\nGameplay generally borrows from thw work of Quentin Tarantino, with plenty of gory explosions and dismemberment. The shooting mechanics are tight and refined, including a wide range of weapons which can all be dual wielded for maximum carnage. This works fairly well and allows the player to mix up the gameplay whenever it is desired. You can also take cover and peer over obstacles. You also have a mostly non-regenerating health bar, and there is more empasis on old school mechanics like health-kits and armour pickups. The refinement of somewhat simple mechanics means that this game is a successful blend of old and new age shooters, meaning the game never grows boring and even breathes fresh life into the genre. The levels are less restricted than other games of the genre, and you are actively encouraged to explore in order to find new weapons and unlocks. New features of the game such as perks (new upgrades unlocked by performing specific tasks) are not necessary to the game, but provide an interesting addition for completionists.\nThe visuals are also quite polished, and the game is often stunning to observe. However, there are occassionally texture pop-ins and slow loading textures, which can get distracting over the course of the game. Despite this, most of the game retains decent visual quality.\nOverall, Wolfenstein: The New Order is an entertaining, over-the-top shooter that surprises you with a quality story and characters you'll really invest in. The high quality of the game ensures a definite return for the series, and has given me high hopes for both this franchise as well as DOOM; Machine Games has lived up to their reputation and delivered a fantastic game not unlike The Darkness and Riddick. Excellent and surprising. 10 / 10.","July 28, 2014","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Combat was solid and fast and brutal, and ridiculously gruesome, definitely not a game for the weak of heart. The game features a really well-built progression system as you go through each level and obtain more and more pieces and parts (not all are found as part of the story, some have to be discovered) and you can really feel the changes in combat as you pick them up.\nMy one complain is that, sometimes, the direction I was supposed to go in was either difficult to follow or stuck me in a bad place with next to no health, and then it saved with me at that point. Nothing playing carefully/slowly wouldn't fix, but sometimes it felt flow-breaking to have to halt the Nazi-Killing-Marathon to tiptoe my way through.\nGreat to play as a Stealth Game or as a pure shoot-'em-up, this is DEFINITELY worth the money they charge. 10/10~","August 18, 2014","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can lean out from cover, there are multiple ways to move around a level, the enemies are aggreessive and will flank you if you stay still for too long, and the weapons are just plain fun. Each has their own unique secondary mode with most of them having the option for dual wielding no matter how ridiculous that may be for the weapon type.\n\nThe characters and story are fairly run of the mill though there are some disturbing exceptions and what you'd expect from this sort of game, just people trying to survive though there are plenty of quirky and memorable faces to be sure. For the most part those characters are well used and the voice acting is superb.\n\nA word of caution however, this game can get grisly. There is a lot of blood and some very disturbing imagery involved that is not normally touched upon in games. To put it simply: you're fighting the Nazis, expect all that implies in gruesome detail, they didn't hold back much.\n\nIn short, go and kill some Nazis.","June 25, 2014","true","23.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The retro futuristic aspect of the game added to my enjoyment. And no hint of multiplayer made this come to the top of my list. The game is challenging at times but it was not enough to drive me away from finishing the game in a long weekend marathon gaming session.\n\nThe game writer did well. I was not expecting the amount of character development  that Blazkowicz undergoes. You feel his pain and sorrow about what he has done and witnessed; his hopes for the future. Over the course of my twelve hour pay through I slow found myself becoming emotionally drawn into Blazkowicz's story and why he was fighting against the tyranny of the Nazis. The mucsical score was another unexpected great joy. Unlike most other games that just have music to have it, here the music adds to the overall feel of teh game and fits the mind set of Blazkowicz at the current moment in time.\n\nHaving an American protagonist but not going to Nazi occupied United States was a small disappointment but going to the moon made up for that.

I pre-ordered the game the moment it came available on steam and can proudly say that I've never had a problem or issue with the game. If one is nit-picky then you'll naturally find the issues as with any game. In short, if you want a fun shoot'em up style of game where the horrors of war follows you everywhere you go the story keeps you hooked the entire time and it only gets better from there. My only wish is the same with other games that are the same price is that I wish there was more that I got with it. Theres so much potential here story-wise for future games and I can't wait to pre-order the next one in the series.\n\nRating 9/10: Minor Spoiler: There are a few minor plot wholes that need fixing but at that moment in the story there's so much going on that you hardly even notice them as the plot wholes are close to the climax. Maybe I'm wrong and I've just missed them being explained in the dialogue but after I played through it a couple times I looked back and couldn't help wonder how a few things happened the way they did. :End Minor Spoiler:\nI give it a 9 out of ten because there are minor things that need fixing, and tweaks to be made, minor adjustments really, but overall I felt that the campaign was....well quick to be honest and when it was over I couldn't help but say that its ending could've been better played out regardless of how its "supposed" to happen plot wise. In short, its a great game thats a lot of fun, definutely not for a minor(as in a child), its got its issues but its not anywhere near as bad as fallout 3, fallout new vegas, or skyrim were at their respective releases, and yes it could be better as with any game not everyone is going to like it.","June 26, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are pretty, the machines and enemies you fight are interesting, It can be played as an all out Shoot em up or as a stealth game, which ever you prefer. I'm not too far into it but I've already spent 7 hours sneaking around, finding all the collectables, and trying to get either knife or silenced headshot stealth insta-kills. It's not too difficult but it is pretty fun.\n\nThe maps have a decent sense of exploration with hidden passage ways and secret item collection eastereggs/health/ammo/collectables. You can ignore all that if you really want but I had fun with it and it's nessecery if you wanna play stealth. I say play stealth but that works like it does in most "stealth"games. You are stealthy for a while, you pick your targets off one by one but then you turn a conor and someone yells for backup, switches on an alarm, and you go into all-out take cover and hold the trigger down mode. Once the you kill the enemies and the alarm goes off things go back to pretending to be stealthy again because apparentlly they didn't bother to phone anyone else.\n\nThe perk system is a set of challenges and while there is somewhat of a tree (a few perks require a previous perk) most everything is up for grabs so you don't have to choose one perk tree to focus on.\n\nThe storyline and lore is a pile of dung but I don't think a lot of people will be expecting an well done story anyway. Typical action hero finds a lady who falls in love with him instantly for no reason, action hero is fully capable of acomplishing any extreme pysichal task even if the story established that he just got out of a 15 year paralysis, etc. There was one point in the story after waking up from said paralysis that went something like this:\n\nHero: Where is the resistance?\nOld lady: Don't you see? The nazis won! They've been ruling the world for 15 years now! There is no america or resistance left!\nHero: Take me to the resistance!\nOld lady: OK.\n\nThat's why I think the storytelling is so awful. I wouldn't have minded if there was no story but making such a big deal of it and at the same time making it so bad is a bit of a setback. Still, the gameplay is fun so I can work to ignore that aspect.\n\nAll the nazis are treated as if they are literally hitler. There's little newspaper clippings spread throughout the levels which help immerse you in the world but all the clippings are about how evil nazis are. The I-hate-you-because-I-label-you-as-a-nazi thing gets really old and seems a bit shallow. If there was anything to be gained from it, it helps you understand what it's like to be on the losing end of a war where you are completly dominated and invaded and although it's exaggerated I did appreciate that perspective.\n\n\nOverall so far I have really enjoyed the game and will continue to play it when I want something simple and slightly challenging to occupy me.\n\n\n","June 28, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For gameplay, a shooter is a shooter is a shooter, though it seems to be very stringy with ammo at times while being exceedingly liberal with it at others. The stealth elements are not as well developed as in, say, DXHR, but they do work.\n\nThe contrast between how seriously it appears to take it's own story and how it can't possibly be serious about it is quite puzzling, though, and I am not sure if this is a positive or a negative.

My only wish is the same with other games that are the same price is that I wish there was more that I got with it. Theres so much potential here story-wise for future games and I can't wait to pre-order the next one in the series.\n\nRating 9/10: Minor Spoiler: There are a few minor plot wholes that need fixing but at that moment in the story there's so much going on that you hardly even notice them as the plot wholes are close to the climax. Maybe I'm wrong and I've just missed them being explained in the dialogue but after I played through it a couple times I looked back and couldn't help wonder how a few things happened the way they did. :End Minor Spoiler:\nI give it a 9 out of ten because there are minor things that need fixing, and tweaks to be made, minor adjustments really, but overall I felt that the campaign was....well quick to be honest and when it was over I couldn't help but say that its ending could've been better played out regardless of how its "supposed" to happen plot wise. In short, its a great game thats a lot of fun, definutely not for a minor(as in a child), its got its issues but its not anywhere near as bad as fallout 3, fallout new vegas, or skyrim were at their respective releases, and yes it could be better as with any game not everyone is going to like it.","June 26, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are pretty, the machines and enemies you fight are interesting, It can be played as an all out Shoot em up or as a stealth game, which ever you prefer. I'm not too far into it but I've already spent 7 hours sneaking around, finding all the collectables, and trying to get either knife or silenced headshot stealth insta-kills. It's not too difficult but it is pretty fun.\n\nThe maps have a decent sense of exploration with hidden passage ways and secret item collection eastereggs/health/ammo/collectables. You can ignore all that if you really want but I had fun with it and it's nessecery if you wanna play stealth. I say play stealth but that works like it does in most "stealth"games. You are stealthy for a while, you pick your targets off one by one but then you turn a conor and someone yells for backup, switches on an alarm, and you go into all-out take cover and hold the trigger down mode. Once the you kill the enemies and the alarm goes off things go back to pretending to be stealthy again because apparentlly they didn't bother to phone anyone else.\n\nThe perk system is a set of challenges and while there is somewhat of a tree (a few perks require a previous perk) most everything is up for grabs so you don't have to choose one perk tree to focus on.\n\nThe storyline and lore is a pile of dung but I don't think a lot of people will be expecting an well done story anyway. Typical action hero finds a lady who falls in love with him instantly for no reason, action hero is fully capable of acomplishing any extreme pysichal task even if the story established that he just got out of a 15 year paralysis, etc. There was one point in the story after waking up from said paralysis that went something like this:\n\nHero: Where is the resistance?\nOld lady: Don't you see? The nazis won! They've been ruling the world for 15 years now! There is no america or resistance left!\nHero: Take me to the resistance!\nOld lady: OK.\n\nThat's why I think the storytelling is so awful. I wouldn't have minded if there was no story but making such a big deal of it and at the same time making it so bad is a bit of a setback. Still, the gameplay is fun so I can work to ignore that aspect.\n\nAll the nazis are treated as if they are literally hitler. There's little newspaper clippings spread throughout the levels which help immerse you in the world but all the clippings are about how evil nazis are. The I-hate-you-because-I-label-you-as-a-nazi thing gets really old and seems a bit shallow. If there was anything to be gained from it, it helps you understand what it's like to be on the losing end of a war where you are completly dominated and invaded and although it's exaggerated I did appreciate that perspective.\n\n\nOverall so far I have really enjoyed the game and will continue to play it when I want something simple and slightly challenging to occupy me.\n\n\n","June 28, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
