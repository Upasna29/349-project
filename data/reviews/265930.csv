The doctors could not tell me why I was so depressed, and I never knew myself until today. I needed to experience my life as a goat. Goat Simulator has filled the void in my life.\n\nI knew as soon as I hit the truck with my goat that this was what I had been missing. I flew through the air in slow motion, tongue flying around, hitting the edge of the map and rebounding back, landing on (and falling through) the roof of a house. I could not get out, but that did not matter. I was treated with the ability to look down into the house beneath me, seeing the unsuspecting people casually sitting at their computers, oblivious to the sheer terror of the goat above them.\n\nWhether it was playing football with a basketball, swinging lampposts into groups of people or even doing 1080 degree flips, there was no limit to life as a goat. I didn't think it could get any better than this.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nAs I jumped and screamed my way around the map, leaving a path of destruction in my wake, I happened upon a golden statue. Curiosity overtook me and I resisted the urge to grab it no longer. My life as a goat changed completely. I had a jetpack.\n\nI knew that this was meant to be, and what my mission from the Great Coffee Stain in the sky was. I was granted the supergoat power of being able to lift people and cars with my tongue. I could survive any impact. I could slow down time with mere thought. Now I could fly. It was time for world domination. Humanity had to be silenced so that the new goat overlords could reign supreme.\n\n\nAll the humans are dead or enslaved. I have won. I am the goat, the goat is me.\n\nGo and goat this game. I kid you not, for mere bucks you can experience a sandbox like no other. Destruction, mayhem, death defying stunts. Seriously, there are more than 921 million goats in the world. Killing the humans was just part of the game. This is a SIMULATOR. Do you understand? A SIMULATOR. This can happen. There are enough goats out there to enslave us and/or kill us.\n\nIt is your duty as a human to get this game, so that you may truly know your enemy. An enemy people do not take seriously, an enemy that we know nothing about. Coffee Stain studios have granted us the insight into the true terrifying reality of the impending Goatpocalypse. This is your weapon against the goats. Be prepared, for the goats are coming to get us.","March 28, 2014","true","10.3"," 18,653 of 20,052 people (93%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","93","653","20","25","392"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/265930/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","So I was deciding whether to do a serious review on Goat Simulator because I haven't seen one on Steam; so rather than join the bandwagon of unfunny jokey reviews for the game, I'll stick to my guns...\n\nGoat Simulator does exactly what it says on the tin; you play as a Goat, You cause havoc wherever you go; trashing, bashing, causing explosions, destroying houses, jumping on trampolines, basically anything you want. With plenty of interactive objects in the game, you can spend plenty of time wandering around never finding a dull moment.\n\nThe graphics in goat simulator are really nice. They aren't on the levels of Evolve or something, but for this type of game, you aren't really going to be playing for the top of the range graphics.  The music and audio are exactly what you would expect here; derpy music in the background as you potter about the city, along with cries of fear from the civilians as the demon goat runs rampant.\n\nThere are three different areas in Goat Simulator; each zone is huge, ranging from theme parks, to crop fields, every building has something to do in it, every room has something to interact with or destroy. I honestly don't think there is anything wrong with either of the levels included here.  There is nothing difficult in the game to do here at all. There are no real objectives, just an open world sandbox game where you do whatever you want, whenever you want.\n\nI have managed to put about twenty hours into Goat Simulator; most of this time was playing on local screen co-op with my girlfriend, and then a couple more hours’ achievement hunting, and boy there is some pretty ridiculous achievements to do. Other than the developers openly coming out stating that they would not be fixing any bugs in the game, I had no real game breaking bugs, apart from sometimes falling through the world; however this was fixed easily by just respawning again.\n\nIf you want a game that is just purely for messing around in with no real aim and wanting some real stupidity, then Goat Simulator will give you plenty of fun; granted this type of game is not for everyone, I enjoyed it though.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you would like to follow my reviews more easily, be sure to join my group by clicking here.","May 2, 2015","true","23.0"," 1,759 of 1,910 people (92%) found this review helpful 119 people found this review funny","92","759","1","119","9"

Sure there were lots of aspiring astronauts, lawyers, doctors, movie stars, and professional athletes. I wanted none of that. Since I grew up around farms, I had a deep admiration for goats. They were masters of their domains, and they didn't take nonsense from anyone. The goats were free to roam, climb, fornicate, and eat anything they could find. So it only made sense that I wanted to be a goat when I grew up.\n\nMy teacher and fellow students told me my dream was unrealistic and impossible.\nThe Steam Gods have gifted me with Goat Simulator 2014 GOATY Edition.\nNow who's laughing?","March 28, 2014","true","11.0"," 738 of 848 people (87%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","87","738","848","10","12"

Whoever you are, you might as well go to the curators, because if you've come for a review on this game, you've come to the wrong place.

Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)\n\n2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.\n\n3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.\n\n4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.\n\n5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.\n\nFor a Rocky Road Bar:\n1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.)

No... no, don't leave yet. Stay awhile -- relax a bit, have some tea. Chamomile perhaps? It was always a favorite of mine, back in the old days in the Romanian countryside, where I grew to manhood alongside Scruffles, my pet bear. Scruffles was a gentle bear for the most part, but he was a deeply troubled soul. I could not forsee what terrible things he would do to that family. Sometimes I think back on it and wonder what more I could have done for him; wonder if there were any signs that I missed, or if I had ever been unkind to him in any way...\n\nOh, but I forget myself again. I apologize. Let me stoke the fire one moment.... there... now where were we? Oh yes, the game. Yes, here you are once more, perhaps after a few days, or maybe even months. You've heard whispers about it, you've seen the videos, and perhaps you even watched a friend play it. You saw it listed once, you clicked on it -- you debated on whether or not you should dip into the money you were saving for your wifes anniversary dinner. Or perhaps you scoffed, your nose held high, unwilling to part with your hard earned cash in exchange for this utter rubbish. Whatever the case, you're back here, aren't you?\n\nIs it a Steam sale that now draws your attention? Perhaps it's always been on your list of games to buy? Or has the morbid curiosity in you reached that point of no return? Are you unable to restrain yourself from clicking that purchase button? Are you even okay?\n\nDon't answer that last question; you ARE okay. You will be okay. Everything from now on will always be.... okay. You see it wasn't just you that brought you back here for what could possibly be the fifth time... it was Goat. You don't know Goat, except that you do. Goat has always been with you, whether you're aware of it or not. The lingering presence, the angel on your shoulder, the devil in your gut -- all of it was Goat. Goat has been with you in your dreams. Goat was with you during your SAT's. Goat was there when you stood beside the pastor and watched your beloved walk down the isle.\n\nGoat was there. Goat was always there.\n\nAnd here you are again, reading this review, wondering whether or not you should purchase Goat Simulator; wondering if it will fullfill you in ways only few other games have.

Well there are no more questions you need to ask yourself now is there? There are no more questions because suddenly the way is clear.\n\nGoat is calling you home. From the moment you were born, Goat has been there with you, watching over you, waiting until you were worthy of the glory that lies beyond the purchase button. Every time you nearly touched it, it was Goat that slapped your hand away.... because you were not yet ready for the greatness. But Goat is calling you, and you can hear him now. Goat is waiting for you on the other side. The great beyond lies waiting for you -- it is a place of light, healing, transcendance... and whales. Lots, and lots of whales.\n\nBut above all the great beyond is that one place you've always been walking towards though you never really knew it. It's Eden. It's Valhalla. It's the Stars.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shredsterseven/recommended/265930/","shredsterseven","Shredster VII","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shredsterseven/","414 products in account","NOTICE: This review is EXTREMELY old and contains EXTREMELY outdated information. Please take this into consideration before starting another ♥♥♥♥ing flame war in the comments.\n\nLet’s get this first bit out of the way up in front: putting Goat Simulator on a traditional 1-to-10 rating scale is pretty much impossible.\n\nGoat Simulator is something of a paradox. It's a haphazard conglomeration of shallow, half-♥♥♥♥♥ game mechanics that still somehow equals something much greater than the sum of its parts. Most bargain bin games last too long and don’t have any personality; Goat Simulator bleeds personality but wears itself out much too quickly.\n\nIn short, it’s like slamming down 20 bucks for half of a chocolate bar, but it’s the best damn chocolate bar you’ll ever have the pleasure of consuming.\n\nThe game prides itself on its broken ragdoll physics; headbutt a person and they’ll go flying off into the sunset with their limbs splayed all about, headbutt a gas station and you’ll go flying off into the sunset with your limbs splayed all about. The problem here is that ragdoll physics abuse has been present in video games for the last decade or so, ranging from dragging bodies around in Deus Ex Human Revolution to blowing enemies sky-high in Just Cause 2 to… well, Garry’s Mod, full stop. Everything you’re going to see in this game is something you’ve probably already seen before.\n\nPerhaps the game’s biggest flaw is its scoring mechanics. Or, to be more specific, that the scoring mechanics don’t really mesh with the rest of the game all that well. By performing certain actions, such as ramming things, licking things, and jumping over things, you can combo these actions together to increase your score as well as extend your combo and gain score multipliers. However, most of the actions you can perform that won’t result in your goat ragdolling uncontrollably will stop increasing your score multiplier VERY quickly, and if you DO end up ragdolling, chances are high that you won’t be able to recover in time to extend your combo further anyways.\n\nThe most aggravating part of this discrepancy is that the actions that do result in you ragdolling uncontrollably – such as getting thrown into a trampoline by a rogue treadmill – are worth the most points out of any action in the game. This is only made worse once you realize that trying to earn a high score unlocks absolutely NOTHING. Compare to Saints Row IV’s insurance fraud missions, where you have to abuse your ragdoll enough within a set amount of time in exchange for monetary and experience rewards.\n\nParadoxically, the game’s strongest point is its bizarre sense of humor, and I’m not referring to the cheap novelty of playing as a jelly-legged goat. The game’s too-small map is absolutely jam-packed with easter eggs and shout-outs. Destroying the gas station gets you the Michael Bay achievement. Bringing five people to a pentagram gives you the power to create gravity wells. Dragging a boulder in front of a normally indestructible car causes it to explode violently. Bringing a bacon-beacon to a crop circle causes a UFO to abduct you. There are rioters carrying signs that read “no ♥♥♥♥♥-shaped food”. Standing inside an outhouse for three seconds nets you over a thousand points. There’s an anime robot hiding in a shipping container suspended by a crane. Doing nothing for five minutes turns you into a low-gravity angel goat. Coffee Stain Studios’ in-game building features a playable Flappy Bird clone. The list goes on and on and on.\n\nBecause of the large amount of easter eggs present within the game, the game is at its most entertaining when you’re NOT throwing yourself around like a maniacal rubber squirrel. Finding many of the upgrades for your goat requires exploring the game’s environment, which itself requires a surprising amount of dexterity. There’s a Baseball Cannon nearby where you start the game, which you can strap to your back and fire at will. There’s also the Jet Pack hidden inside the construction site, which is about as useful as you’d expect from a game like this (it’s completely useless). Perhaps the most noteworthy of these collectables are the 30 goat trophies hidden across the map; every 10 trophies you collect will unlock a whole new species of goat for you to use: a giraffe, an ostrich, and an alien from Sanctum 2. Quite a few of these trophies are legitimately challenging – and entertaining - to collect.\n\nPerhaps the game’s greatest saving grace is the Steam Workshop integration. Though ironically (or perhaps fittingly), even getting THAT to work properly can be problematic – you’ll need to install the 64-bit version of the game’s executable, which comes with the game’s mod development kit. And even then, many of the custom maps available will still cause the game to crash on startup.\n\nOnce you’ve gotten the bloody thing to WORK properly, however, it’s worthwhile. Some of the community-created add-ons are an absolute blast to use. There are mods that let you chuck explosive watermelons as fast as you can mash the use key, there are mods that turn you into a goat-shaped Nyan Cat, and there are mods that let you play pinball with the goat as the ball. Since the game is still brand new, much of the game’s potential has gone untapped. However, given some time, the possibility that a truly amazing game could evolve from these add-ons is extremely realistic… provided that said add-ons don’t freakin' crash the game.\n\nOverall, the game itself honestly isn’t all that bad – it’s actually pretty entertaining, but for all the reasons that they DON’T mention on the game’s Steam Store page. The game’s biggest flaw isn’t that the game is broken, it’s that the game is… incomplete. There’s a lot of stuff to see here, especially with the game’s Workshop integration, but the game’s core mechanics simply don’t mesh with each other very well (if at all). The game doesn’t even seem to know what its core audience is supposed to be – small children, experienced DOOM-era gamers, and programmers would probably find the game hilarious, but your average Angry Birds player will look at this game and wonder how the world became so full of stupid people.\n\nIf you’re the type of person who greatly enjoys making mods, enjoys breaking games in half, or simply needs a cheap laugh once in a while, then Goat Simulator may very well be one of the best games you’ll ever play. However, if you don’t fit into any of the above categories, then I regret to inform you that you’re probably better off spending your money on something else.\n\nIt’s a shame, really – there’s a fantastic game buried in here somewhere, it’s just that nobody’s found it yet.","April 7, 2014","false","9.4"," 1,700 of 2,477 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","700","2","0","63"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/265930/","Stefneh","Stefneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/","777 products in account","I am updating this review every time the game is updated. This review is going to look at the game in stages rather than as a whole. As that is pretty much how I have played it.\n\nFirst Impressions: The Original Review\nGoatVille\n\nGaming just GOAT serious!\nIf this game doesn’t get GO(a)TY, then you just GOAT to be kidding me…\nI mean, if it doesn’t float your GOAT, then that’s fine. But seriously, this GOAT is just too GOAT.\n\n...But in all seriousness, it’s the one of the most original and fun games that I have played in a while. It’s got a good humour to it. You can tell the people that made it were just having a laugh and it seems to me they didn’t expect it to get as big as it did. I think it was pretty refreshing when it came out, something different and stupid to mess around on. Has quirky little things in the game that makes you chuckle and I have never known ragdolls to fail at making people laugh.\n\nThe fact that it has Steam workshop makes it a lot more appealing also, the game itself can be completed 100% within a day or two. But at least with the workshop you have something to keep you entertained if you ever wanted to re-visit. Despite its length I still really enjoyed it and look forward to any updates that may come to this game. There’s many more possibilities with maps and different goats, so who knows!\n\nAll in all you just have to get this game and give it a fair goat.\n\nUPDATE 1: New Map!\nGoat City Bay\n\nThey updated the game to have another map and twice the achievements. Essentially free DLC, which I thought was actually a really nice addition to the game. It gives you more play time and new features to mess around with. It also shows the developers are in this more so for the long run than a quick cash builder because it blew up. I would easily say the update doubled the game, I completed the updated achievements 100% again although there were a few trickier ones this time around. I really hope they keep them updates coming!\n\nUPDATE 2: An Interesting Turn\nGoat MMO Simulator\n\nThis update was a pretty big one! They took a whole new turn with it as well. Goat MMO Simulator was a great idea. It was a nice way to keep the game’s silly yet quirky charm going. Something new and different and it really was fun. I would say that I found this update easier to 100% then Goat City Bay but that makes it no less enjoyable. There were a few references I was pleasantly surprised/amused by. This ‘free extra content’ thing Coffee Stain Studios have going on here is great. Again, I would love to see more in future!\n\nUPDATE 3: Another Genre Mockery!\nGoatZ\n\nI was very surprised this time around that the new update wasn’t free. There was a slight bit of disappointment there but when I actually stopped to think about it, the devs have already expanded the game so much for free. I don’t blame them for asking for a small bit of money this time.\n\nThis new DLC is an obvious mockery to the survival horror genre that’s just all over the damn place these days. It’s a funny concept and follows the MMO joke nicely.\n\nAlthough I was pretty content and hadn’t much to say about the previous updates, there were a few things with GoatZ I felt I needed to mention.\n\nThroughout this whole game I have 100%ed it all the way. In survival mode of GoatZ, this probably would have been impossible if not for the workshop mod to stop your hunger. Your goat is hungry every 2 minutes and you’re so busy just looking for food to survive that it’s pretty impossible to do anything else (you can play the map in “Before Breakout” and “After Breakout” mode, so before is an option). I just thought the hunger was a little excessive even though it’s an obvious joke within itself and there are still a number of things you actually need to do in survival mode if you’re looking to complete it.\n\nUsing the “No Hunger” workshop mod I managed to re-100% the game. Although there were some very very tedious achievements this time around. Which were made a lot worse by how many times the game crashed whilst I was playing. “Craft every item in one game” – get to the last one, then it crashes. I wasn’t a happy bunny, that’s for sure. Looking back on it now, everything else seemed pretty straight forward. But none the less the whole thing still just felt tedious as hell.\n\nThe references and humour has kept up throughout the whole thing and it’s always nice to see funny little references that I understand. It’s always nice to see more from these devs to be honest!\n\nI would say overall the DLC is worth it despite all the things I moaned about. It’s still fun to mess around with in a none-serious fashion. Just prepare for a storm of frustrated sighing if you are wanting to 100% it.\n\nWhat will they do next?!\n\n\nTL;DR : Goat.\n","May 16, 2015","true","39.4"," 153 of 210 people (73%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","73","153","210","72","13"

No... no, don't leave yet. Stay awhile -- relax a bit, have some tea. Chamomile perhaps? It was always a favorite of mine, back in the old days in the Romanian countryside, where I grew to manhood alongside Scruffles, my pet bear. Scruffles was a gentle bear for the most part, but he was a deeply troubled soul. I could not forsee what terrible things he would do to that family. Sometimes I think back on it and wonder what more I could have done for him; wonder if there were any signs that I missed, or if I had ever been unkind to him in any way...\n\nOh, but I forget myself again. I apologize. Let me stoke the fire one moment.... there... now where were we? Oh yes, the game. Yes, here you are once more, perhaps after a few days, or maybe even months. You've heard whispers about it, you've seen the videos, and perhaps you even watched a friend play it. You saw it listed once, you clicked on it -- you debated on whether or not you should dip into the money you were saving for your wifes anniversary dinner. Or perhaps you scoffed, your nose held high, unwilling to part with your hard earned cash in exchange for this utter rubbish. Whatever the case, you're back here, aren't you?\n\nIs it a Steam sale that now draws your attention? Perhaps it's always been on your list of games to buy? Or has the morbid curiosity in you reached that point of no return? Are you unable to restrain yourself from clicking that purchase button? Are you even okay?\n\nDon't answer that last question; you ARE okay. You will be okay. Everything from now on will always be.... okay. You see it wasn't just you that brought you back here for what could possibly be the fifth time... it was Goat. You don't know Goat, except that you do. Goat has always been with you, whether you're aware of it or not. The lingering presence, the angel on your shoulder, the devil in your gut -- all of it was Goat. Goat has been with you in your dreams. Goat was with you during your SAT's. Goat was there when you stood beside the pastor and watched your beloved walk down the isle.\n\nGoat was there. Goat was always there.\n\nAnd here you are again, reading this review, wondering whether or not you should purchase Goat Simulator; wondering if it will fullfill you in ways only few other games have. Or maybe you just wonder why you're back here again, after so many other visits, trying to figure out just what it is that compells you to return. Well there are no more questions you need to ask yourself now is there? There are no more questions because suddenly the way is clear.\n\nGoat is calling you home. From the moment you were born, Goat has been there with you, watching over you, waiting until you were worthy of the glory that lies beyond the purchase button. Every time you nearly touched it, it was Goat that slapped your hand away.... because you were not yet ready for the greatness. But Goat is calling you, and you can hear him now. Goat is waiting for you on the other side. The great beyond lies waiting for you -- it is a place of light, healing, transcendance... and whales. Lots, and lots of whales.\n\nBut above all the great beyond is that one place you've always been walking towards though you never really knew it. It's  Eden. It's Valhalla. It's the Stars. It's Goat Simulator.\n\nCome home to the great beyond. Come home to Goat.","August 2, 2015","true","10.3"," 219 of 312 people (70%) found this review helpful 291 people found this review funny","70","219","312","291","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snivilian/recommended/265930/","snivilian","Sniver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snivilian/","58 products in account","once a true story, it is now a forgotten legend due to a legendary hero defeating the goat king.\nWhat's this?\nYou don't know that legend?\nOf course you don't, buttfarts, it's forgotten!\n\nNow sit down on your fanny cakes, as I retell the legend of legends.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a time that once existed after time, there was a walrus queen who ruled all time. The walrus queen was not beautiful. At all. Her fanny was tied in a knot, her whiskers a flood on her face; Short story, she was ugly! However, the walrus queen did do her role in walrus society. And that was holding a bucket and pretending she was a whale. This one day, the walrus queen, as everyone knows, asexually reproduced, and out popped a little rascal: a goat. The walrus queen looked at the little baby goat, charmed by its exquisitely beautifulness. She then whips her tail at the goat, kicking the goat into the dark, blue sea, because that's what all walruses do to their babies. True story! So the walrus queen's a butt now, yada yada yada, but who cares about the walrus queen? I don't. Let's follow that goat, eh?\n\nThe goat's body lay motionless, floating on the surface of the sparkling ocean. But if you remember correctly, if you remember the last paragraph, this goat WAS the birth baby of the walrus queen. As if magic was real, this little goat started jumping ON the water, over the water at high speed! Yet, he hardly moved, but little ragdoll-like movements! What could this goat be capable of?! The goat sped over the high seas, across storms, across boats, but none had hurt his lightning speed! Well, maybe the boat. It did have a hot tub after all... I mean, this goat was going REALLY fast! But alas, all crazy things may come to an end. Or will they? After a day and a day and a d- a very long time, the goat landed on land. An island with a small city, and a theme park! What trouble could the little fartbrain get into here?\n\nAfter a few hours of sunbathing on the warm sand, the little goat stood up, with little to no effort! Like magic! But not. The little goat gazed around, seeing the umbrellas and towels and... people! Suddenly, the kid had a sudden want of suddenly... licking everything? Within a second, the goat's really long tongue shot out and struck the closest person; a very fat man. The tongue was sticking to the plump man! The goat started to run away, but somehow, the tongue had like 50 bajillion muscles, as the fatty was being dragged by the tongue! That's gross. That's really gross. It's just like that Steamer guy from Right 2 Alive. BUT let's not talk about that. Let's talk about the horror that the goat will become.\n\nNo one screamed or anything. They just kinda stared at the animal pulling a somewhat lifeless man with its tongue. I guess there WERE some crazy people who said, "Aww, that's so cute!" At least that was the last thing they said, as they were dragged to nowhere at somewhere. The little goat had so much stamina. Or was stamina even a word for him? He would never stop! Well, he did stop in front of a store. Full of hats. BEAUTIFUL hats. Detaching its tongue from a pink lady, the goat stared through the windowed display. He took one step back. The goat then RAMMED THROUGH THE WINDOW, BLEATING AROUND. He then licked all of the hats. All of them.But... what's this? They're... GOAT-PROOF?! The kid stared at the hats, with a sad look. The shopkeeper. who was somehow unafraid, stood behind the counter. "Ya need money, kid." The goat stared at the shopkeeper.\n\nThe city's probably bankrupt now. I mean, no one has money now, except the shopkeeper. And the only thing now that the goat owns is a pile of hats. HATS. I wonder if he would give me so- I mean, he had a lot of hats. So off around, again he pranced. He did all kinds of things a goat wouldn't do. But would. So events and events and event after event*, he finally came about to a majestic land, full of majesticness! THE THEME PARK! There was SO MUCH to do! And that he did*.\n\nThe goat spent years, years growing up at his simple life, without drink, food, or anything. But when he explored further, he found another city. With his tongue and head bashing, PROFESSIONAL skills, he explored once more. He became the demon king, the summoner of whales, and became the first goat with a jetpack. He trampled with boulders, destroyed many landmarks, and defeated the ♥♥♥♥♥-shaped food protestors. He was a hero(?). But there he stood, before a tall tower, there were some. Some of his own kind. What nonsense was this? He licked and rammed the goats off the tower, because this goat is a total di-, ah-, jerk. There was a small entrance at the top of the tower's spiraling stairs. Curiousity never killed the goat, so why say not to the goat entering it?\n\nThe goat entered a large, sparkling hall, with goats side by side along the long red carpet. The goat peered at the large throne ahead of him. There was no one there? He began to ram every single goat. With all the peasant goats laying on the shiny clean floor tiles, the goat then claimed the throne as his own. Everything began shaking, as if Zeus himself farted on the world in disgrace. The goat fell unconscious, with the world spinning around him.\n\nThe goat awoke in a grass field. He felt a weird tightness around his forehead. He had a crown. A KING'S crown. He had known what had happen. He had to go to the urinal, but couldn't hold the pain anymore, so he fell unconscious. Right? OH, wait wrong game. But, I think he's the Goat King now! The Goat King bleated proudly, loudly. Then peasant goats, PEASANTS, began to rain like, well, falling goats from the sky! The Goat King was unafraid. These were his peasants. And by this, he would make an army.\n\nSo World War lll almost started, so what? The Goat King continued with doing everything he did in his own childhood, except with x10 more goat. The people were frighthened, some crazies still saying, "Aww, that's cute." Again, before getting rammed. So chaos pursues! But chaos always has an ending! It wasn't like there was police or anything, just... Listen! As the Goat King was terrorizing children while riding a bicycle, a loud booming voice was heard. "STOP!" The Goat King lost controlk of the bicycle and rammed into a gas truck. That truck exploded shortly after. Regaining strength, the Goat King turned his head to see a majestic, plump figure. It was HIM. It was Gaben.\n\nThe Goat King was aware of this legendary hero. But he wasn't aware that The Gaben would come after himself. "STOP!" The Gaben repeated. The Goat King, however, did not want to stop. The Goat King bleated as loud as he could ever bleat, summoning more peasants from the sky. The bodies hit the floor. They did nothing. The peasant goats never did anything. They're useless. The Gaben shook his head in disbelief. The Goat King was pi- angry now! With the gracefulness of a bull, he began to charge towards the Gaben. The Gaben was in no harm. In fact, he was never in harm at all. Calm and majestically, he rose a finger towards the charging Goat King. As the Goat King's nose and the finger of the Gaben came in contact, The Gaben said his own name. "Gaben." (Of course, a legendary hero would never reveal their own name.) The Goat King was frozen. With a flick of his wrist, the Gaben blasted the Goat King into sky, the Goat King leaving a trail of dosh, money, and all of that shizzles. The Gaben smiled at the defeated villain. He then flew away on his flying tub of butter.\n\nLegend says the Goat King still bleats in space. Truth says Gaben's still a hero.\n\nThis "simulator" isn't a "simulator." This is time, the time of the Goat King, BEFORE he was defeated by The Gaben.\nThis is a story. The story of the Goat King. And you're the writer.","August 9, 2014","true","3.2"," 68 of 87 people (78%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","78","68","87","29","9"

The game is fully explorable from the start. - Despite the assumed instability of a game that's spazzy as good ♥♥♥♥, it's actually surprisingly stable, or at least has been for me (and I'm not on the greatest computer in the world).\n\nHowever, though simple at first, the game also offers ample challenge for those who're more adept to the gaming universe, certain achievements require you to bring your A-Game and nothing less; Goat Simulator I feel is a great title for both casual and experienced gamers, even more-so for gamers who merely want some good laughs. Just about everything I did in this game made me at the very 'least' smile, and was a great pick-me-up from the normal "I'm so srs" games. They really break out from the norm with their Tony Hawk's style 'secret gaps/events' so to speak. (Sorry guys it's the only thing I could think to relate it to lol) Headbutting a gas station, or shooting a basketball in to a goal-field are some examples; they really put some genuine thought in to what players could get in to, and that makes this game just so much more epic.\n\nSpoiler regarding unlockables:\n\nThe unlockables in this game are great too!  Varying from alternate models of your goat, such as the Giraffe and Ostrich as some examples, which both give their own unqiue flavour of the gameplay. There's also a bunch of mutators for the game already, you just have to unlock them first.  Though with Workshop compatibility from the get-go, I foresee this game being full of player created maps, goats, and other fun content! Especially being of the Unreal engine, I'm very excited to see how this game grows.\n\nBut as it stands, it's already a bundle of fun, and a must-have for those who want a "realistic" goat simulation experience.\n\n\n*TL;DR:\nBuy Goat Simulator, is good game.\nBaah.","March 29, 2014","true","16.2"," 52 of 66 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","52","66","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/recommended/265930/","scares","Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/","666 products in account","Game name: Goat Simulator\nReviewed by: Wolf\n\nIn Summary...Goat Simulator is a widely popular indie game started by Coffee Stain Studios back in 2014. The overall game idea and atmosphere seems like a joke, literally, as it's littered with not only player mesh bugs but also gameplay and graphical bugs. Goat Simulator focuses around the idea of yes: being a goat. You're encouraged to cause chaos between multiple levels introduced from new updates and DLC. There is not much more to it than that, and as you can imagine, the novelty wears thin after a few hours time.\n\n\nControls:WASD - Standard movement\nMouse - Standard look\nQ - Ragdoll effect\nF - Slow Mo\nE - "Lick"\nMouse 1 - Headbutt\nMouse 2 - Rotate in air\n1 - Baaa\n\nSounds:The game features very basic sounds, it comes with an actual soundtrack which is played throughout. It's quite fitting, entertaining, and not very annoying as some games of the same genre are. They even have a Deadmau5 track as an easter egg! (Song is called Deadgoa7)\n\nGraphics:Here's where it gets tricky. The graphics are easily very good, as well as provide some high quality personality to characters and environments. Yet, since the first DLC, GoatZ, framerates have significantly dropped. I was able to run the vanilla game maxed out at 1080p 60fps (VSync on due to screen tearing, and I like it on in single player games), and when the DLC was released my framerates dropped to below 20's (at times) and that's with resolution downscaled to 720p and all settings on low. The Payday update did phenominally better, I was able to return to 1080p 60fps. I'm hoping the game developers realize they need to test a patch before sending it out.\n\nGame Balance:As stated before, the game is littered with bugs. Some, although comical (player model going crazy when going up ladders) which are quite comical and non-game breaking, and some which are completely trash (recently the Payday DLC, where you're allowed to drive vehicles. The vehicles have no control whatsoever, meaning the slighest bit of air causes you to flip over at times). You're able to get stuck into almost solid object by walking into it, sometimes even glitching through it and ending up in a non-escapable invisible area. There's some missing textures, some of which are walls you can just walk right on through. (Devs, there's a line between a comical glitch and a problem, for the love of god, glitches are problems.)\n\nOtherNone.\n\nFinal Rating:6/10\n\nIn Conclusion:When on sale (even not, third party sites offer this game dirt cheap) it's quite a great title, you can have plenty of fun mucking about being a goat and baaing some chaos onto the streets. The novelty wears thin after a while, so if you're not into taking a trip of doing some repetitive tasks (some do not realize theres actual objectives to the game) then this game isn't for you. Out of the time played and the DLC's released, it offered more than plenty of enjoyable time. (Also please fix the cars).\n\nPlease feel free to follow my curation page for more recommendations.

Over the past few years the simulation game market has taken a page from Reality TV and has attempted to adapt every  imaginable banal blue collar occupation into a video game. The men and women who lead quiet lives of desperation as lumberjacks, farmers, truck driver, warehouse logistics managers and car mechanics have all been memorialized with insipid games that are mostly purchased by the same people who wear socks with sandals, have closets full of sweater vests and fastidiously maintain button collections. A few games have masked themselves as simulators but have delivered hilarious facsimiles of what they aim to simulate and perhaps the most absurd of these is Goat Simulator.\n\nCapra aegagrus hircus, the domestic goat; hero of goat simulator. This four legged beast yearns to escape from his suburban backyard confinement, to be free to lick and kick and headbutt to his heart's content. Utilizing this creature's amazing dexterity, unparalleled agility and immense headbutting strength you must roam and conquer the lands held by homo sapiens... Or something like that. Goat Simulator doesn't attempt to have a plot, instead it places players in the middle of a suburban sandbox allowing them to roam around and use their bearded four legged monstrosity to complete a list of objectives and rack up points. Imagine playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater without a time limit and instead of riding a skateboard, you filled the trotters of a barn yard creature... It's completely absurd and for the first hour or so a complete riot. The ragdolls and animations are intentionally ridiculous and the things your goat is able to do seem to have been the result of the the development team brainstorming while high and watching a Jackass marathon. Wearing a jetpack, sacrificing humans to satan, bouncing on trampolines, getting abducted by aliens and headbutting protestors are all normal Goat simulator activities. It's not a game that's meant to be taken seriously in the least. It's designed for pure hedonism and escapism.\n\nThat said, Goat Simulator is not without surprises however. Few other modern games encourage exploration and experimentation in the same way that Goat Simulator does. The list of objectives can be tackled in any order and bumbling around the map uncovers secrets and Easter eggs. There are a few special items lying around that can prove useful and these are not highlighted in any way giving players a welcome surprise when they are able to pick them up and use them. Pretty much any and every object of interest that you can see can be reached in some way. A jetpack can allow you to clumsily propel your bearded barn yard dwelling beast through the air while a pitching machine can allow your goat to fling baseballs at people and, if you are creative, glide. There are two reasonably large areas to explore  containing more than the asking price's worth of things to see and ruin.\n\nWhen it comes to ruin, there are a few flaws that present themselves and diminish players desire to live out their wildest fantasies as a goat. The controls, and in particular the camera, are a bit sloppy making some moments where more precise movement is required a bit taxing. The camera has a tendency to clip through some walls making navigating tight spaces a chore. Controlling the bike is initially frustrating since it uses the mouse to steer and this simultaneously operates the camera. More vexing is the way multiple special abilities and mutators stack. By completing special actions your goat earns special abilities and these abilities are almost always mapped to the same key. There is no way to toggle between what special ability is active so each time you attempt to use a special ability several things happen simultaneously. For instance, there is a mutator that allows you to summon sperm whales from the sky and if you also have the mutator that allows you to drop Minecraft style blocks you will find that each time you toggle what type of block you wish to deploy moby ♥♥♥♥ drops from the sky like some sort of  divine curse cluttering the area. What's worse, creatures that are summoned do not despawn and after a while this will take a toll on your frame rate.\n\nThe developer of Goat Simulator has consciously neglected to fix any bugs that don't affect the stability of the game simply for amusement purposes. The problem is that physics bugs are the to video games what fart jokes are to cinema—decidedly low brow and with each cheap laugh the return is greatly diminished. Within the first hour, most players will exhaust the game of all it's humor leaving only the appeal of discovering what lies in the game world's nooks and crannies. Physics bugs are not the only imperfections that linger in goat simulator, some surfaces can be clipped through and may leave players trapped. Fortunately, a respawn option keeps any progress from being lost. A single horrible looping track makes up most of the soundtrack in Goat Simulator and makes playing for more than an hour or two nearly impossible. There are some additional tracks in specific areas of the game world but they don't offer much of a reprieve from the obnoxious primary track. Needless to say many players will have a love hate relationship with the games very deliberate lack of polish.\n\nBeing an urbanite, I must confess to knowing nothing about goats going into goat Simulator and after putting a half dozen hours into it I still know nothing about goats. That's just as well since the low brow laughs and stupidity provided by Goat Simulator are far more welcome than what sweater vest wearing button collectors might demand from such a title. The decision to keep this simulator rough around the edges works against it as much as for it but at the end of the day this clunky little title provides sufficient amusement to justify its asking price.","August 19, 2014","true","7.6"," 41 of 51 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","41","51","5","4"

Look at this silly goat! It's doing things that goats don't normally do! lolololololol ragdol fisikz"\nAs you could probably guess, the gag wears thin quickly. There are some good laughs in the achievement "Micheal Bay", which you get from exploding a gas station, but they're one-time jokes.\nThe few maps are pretty small, condensed, but don't have enough content to be fun for more than 20 minutes each.\n\n"But you can download more!", I hear you cry, but alas- mods suck. The modding community is smaller than a pinecone that has been grown to a couple pages worth of pinecone-leave-things that crash the game when they're loaded.* The other "goats" you can download and unlock are, again, good for a few laughs. I've never seen another game where Shrek can fly around on all fours with a jetpack before lightly touching a vent and being flung into the stratosphere. The problem is that said experience is just not fun, and it takes control from your hands for a while until you hit the ground again.\n\nThe scoring system makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever, it seems to just throw points at you willy-nilly for being airborne and doing some spins or something, but it feels like however many points I got had nothing to do with me, making most of the achievements feel meaningless, as most of them come up to "Score points" or "Stay airborne for x seconds".\n\nI know the game was made in a short time, I know it's meant to be bad, but that doesn't excuse it. Calling a rock a rock doesn't make it better than a rock.* Also, the game doesn't run very well on most computers, and that's weird.\n\ntl:dr\nBuy Garry's Mod. Same price, runs better on most computers, the gags in this game can be met and expanded upon with GM, better graphics, more interesting to play, and it also has ragdolls.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/265930/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Goat Simulator is incredible. It's awful, and it's insulting, but it's everso slightly incredible at the same time. The game's own developer derides it, claiming the $10 it costs could be better spent on a bunch of bricks, and suggesting it'll be worth picking up in a two dollar sale.\nThere is an interesting question to be had with Goat Simulator - when does pointing out one's own flaws cross the line from charmingly self-deprecating to conceitedly galling? Satirizing bad game design is something that games regularly fail at, because they fall into the trap of simply being the thing they're mocking. Roleplaying games that make fun of obligatory "killing rats in the basement" quests are simply hypocritical if they point out this cliche by making you go through with such a quest.\nCoffee Stain Studios is clearly having fun with the idea of knowingly selling a bad product. It proudly lists bugs as a feature, promising only to fix glitches that outright crash the game, leaving in everything else for hilarity's sake. With its bizarre physics and distinct lack of structure, one could make the case that Goat Simulator has a point to prove, providing a savvy commentary on the state of videogame design - not to mention the temptation of the modern game developer to make bizarre, "random" experiences simply to appeal to YouTube's Let's Play creators.\nThe basics of Goat Simulator are as simple as simple gets - you are a goat, and you smash stuff up. Clicking the mouse as you run about causes the goat to smash things in his path, and pretty much everything exists to be smashed. From fences, to greenhouses, to cars and people, you're required to bash, explode, or otherwise ruin whatever you can get within bleating distance of. Essentially, that's the whole point, and there's very little to worry about beyond that.\nAs you may have guessed by now, the game is a complete mess, and that's supposed to be part of the charm. The physics are insane, our titular goat liable to turn into a ragdoll at the slightest provocation, while random bric-a-brac bounces weightlessly around the environment with a mere touch.\nFor a short while, Goat Simulator is pretty damn entertaining. It nails what made the "Insurance Fraud" minigames of Saints Row so much fun, and expands on the idea in a few amusing ways. With its fairly small map, and limited range of interactions, however, all the goat-based mayhem quickly becomes another Nobi Nobi Boy or Cargo situation - it's a delightfully eccentric experience that suffers from having way more fun with itself than the player can have.\nUltimately, this game is a joke, and it's a joke with a limited shelf life. The humor soon wears off once you've made all the humans run screaming and sent your trotting little beast flying into the air with the help of a few industrial fans. While there are some great little secrets to discover, you only ever need to see them once, and there's very little to keep returning to the game for.\nAs well as the vanilla experience, you can mutate your goat with various unique traits, all of which offer a chuckle the first time around. You can give your goat a "Yoshi" mutation, which lets him swallow items to make bombs, or give him the physical form of a giraffe just because it looks rather funny. These extra modes can extend the running joke a little while, but not for very long.\nAs a joke, as a piece of interactive comedy, Goat Simulator is an undoubted success. The sheer concept is damn funny, and as you see everything for the first time, it's hard not to let a big grin spread across your face. Like all good gags, however, there's only so far it can be taken before it stops raising a smile, and by its very nature, Goat Simulator doesn't have the legs to last more than a short while.","July 29, 2015","true","16.4"," 72 of 107 people (67%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","67","72","107","16","1"

A few months go by and the "MMO Update" came out, and I played it for an  hour until I had enough and left it alone because it was not fun. This game started a trend where people made bad simulator for the "lols" of it, which is dumb because it really is just a joke. Goat simulator tried to parody all the bad simulators that were out there before it but it just added itself to the pile of them. After this game a bunch of games got realeased: "Rock Sim" and "Grass Sim" and the list goes on and on which are all crap and are built around being crap like Goat Sim.\n\nThe whole point of Goat Simulator is that it's glitchy and it's suppose to be bad but that in my opinion is just a dumb concept to build a game around. If lets say an item gets shot into outher space in a shooter or a similar game, it's halarious because that doesn't usually happen but in Goat Sim it's more like:\nI'm gonna walk this way, oh my goat glitched into the floor lol ok (respawns)\nOh my goat  glitched and flew of to space.... I guess that's funny but now I have to walk all the way over there again.\nOk I have to deliver this item to someone better grab it with my to- o it glitched, yet again..... x how much time you spend on this game\n\nPros:\n+Funny for the first 30 mins\n+Collectibles to find across the maps\n+Funny references to other things\n+ Slow motion button  which is lovely\n\nHalf Pros Half Cons:\n-/+Lots of easter eggs (too many and they get quiet repetitive)\n\nCons:\n-The game is too glitchy to actually play\n-Tiny maps and a boring MMO map in the sense that it isn't creative in any way shape or form\n-Jokes that are childish\n-Jokes that are suppose to be funny but don't actually make sense (Played as a microave for example)\n-The score system can be beaten super easily so there is no point for it\n-If you try to knock over people they just get back up so there is no point of doing that\n-The "AI" is poop\n- Extremely annoying soundtrack that just loops around 3 songs\n-Jetpack is pointless because it just spirals out of control\n-30 fps cap\n-Ridiculous pop-in\n\nOverall 4/10 Don't buy this game just for the LOLS because you are just supporting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.\n\n"If you try to make a bad game and succeed, you've made a bad game!

This game is surprisingly fun. The world is interesting, you have funny stuff to do every few meters. The physics are done pretty well (meaning that they exaggerate so much, you constantly laugh your ♥♥♥ off). The controls work fine. You can even do things like backflips and get points for it. They put a big portion of Tony Hawk in the mix, so you really get points for everything you do - including a multiplier. This increases the fun a lot, and keeps you going. There are also collectibles in really strange places, and you have to find ways to get there. This can be quite tricky, but is also a lot of fun and some more motivation to keep playing.\n\nWhat do I not like in the game? The world is way too small. I don't see me playing this for like 20 hours. It is fun now, and I will do some more rounds, but in the long run it will get boring, I think.

I wanted to, and I tried hard to, I really, really did. It looked fun in videos, it came highly recommended by friends and it was on sale at the time I bought it. I should have had a blast with it. But this just doesn't do anything for me.\n\nA brief history for those not in the know, courtesy of Wikipedia, arguably the best pedia on the internet. Goat Simulator started off life as a prototype born from a game jam with the aim being to help developers better learn how to use Unreal Engine. Never intended for human consumption, a posted video went viral and demand pushed the creators to release the game proper, followed several months after by two sizable, free updates adding whole new areas, objectives and gameplay mechanics. It's a great little indie success story that shows how a good idea can be enough to capture people's imagination and wallets. Plus goats. Goats helped a lot there, too. So where did it all go wrong for me? Ultimately, I just didn't have any fun with it at any point.\n\nPlay as a goat and cause general havoc to several areas and their denizens with a combination of wild goat moves, poor morals and bad physics. There are objectives in each area, but they really only serve as loose signposts to gently nudge the player to experiment with the different elements of the game. It's largely a destructive sandbox where you make your own fun and craft your own little adventure through the chaos. But the joke is that just about everything is intentionally bad. The AI has all the intelligence of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ potato, the physics seems to have something of a mind of its own and nothing really makes any sense, it just exists... because. All of that is absolutely fine and I can't fault the goal they were aiming for. But it just never feels like it works for me.\n\nAs strange as it sounds, the joke doesn't feel "earned" here. Playing a game where the punch line is "look at how broken this is", but seeing it in something that's broken by design, just isn't very satisfying. Like... when you're watching dragons fly backwards in Skyrim or faceless teeth and eyes having a serious, heartfelt conversation with you in Assassin's Creed, that's proper p*ss yourself funny exactly because it's not supposed to be there. But when a game is filled with these kinds of things on purpose it loses what made it funny in the first place. I heard a great quote once, which I'm about to totally butcher, that to make people laugh is easy, you just put on an old lady wig and an old lady dress and some old lady glasses and you fall over, that's enough. But to make a comedian laugh it has to be a real old lady falling. And that's what this game feels like to me, it's someone in a silly wig and glasses falling over.\n\nIn fairness, the free MMO update content is much better at hitting its target as it parodies all the tired old tropes of RPGs. Having a fetch quest where the items are literally surrounding the quest-giver, or an escort mission with the slowest NPC ever committed to code, or a chat box perfectly recreating the kind of inane drivel sometimes seen from a minority of bad players that makes you damn near suicidal... all of these things really have something to say and make their point beautifully. But for me it just felt like too little too late.\n\nFor all the people who do love this game, I can't tell them they're wrong. If you enjoy something then it needs no further explanation or justification, that you had fun with it is all that matters, and I wish I could be in that group. But, sadly, if anyone asked then I couldn't recommend this. Go play Just Cause or Saint's Row for your sandbox mayhem shenanigans. Or better yet, go outside and punch a real goat. Aside from the social contempt and court fines, it's absolutely free!","August 21, 2015","false","24.4"," 68 of 104 people (65%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","65","68","104","11","7"

It is pretty much impossible to actually "rate" this game, but I do have a strong opinion on it. This game is very much a one-trick pony, hahah you deadbutted something, oh look you headbutted something else, OH WOW, you headbutted ANOTHER thing. It simply is meant for people who are easily amused, and I'm not trying to say I don't like humor oriented games, but this is just rediculous. This is taken directly from the games description "MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it\nIn-game physics that spazz out all the time"...SERIOUSLY? It is just horrible to think that the game industry has resorted to dumb-minded humor and not even bothering to fix the game because "LOLOL PEWDIEPIE AND NOVA ARE GONNA MAKE IT LOOK SOOOOOOOO FUNNY".\nIf this is the way more games are going to be, I better find a new hobby.","April 15, 2014","false","0.2"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","29","40","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/265930/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Have you ever wondered: what's it like for a day in the life of a goat? The majestic creatures, so far removed from our petty society that you can't help but long to be a part of them, have up until now been woefully misrepresented in video games. But no more! Goat Simulator has arrived and now you too can see what it is like to be one with the goat!\n\nIf you are among those with a broken sarcasm detector, I will come out and say that this is not in fact the realistic goat simulating product we have all been waiting for. What it is however is one of the goofiest, completely absurd, and painfully entertaining games I've had the joy of playing in a very long time.\n\nPutting you in the hooves of an everyday goat, you are placed in what can best be described as an explosive physics sandbox. With the exception of a few challenges and some clever achievements, your only real task is to cause as much mayhem as you can in the most outrageous ways you can imagine. Licking a bolder and going on a rampage dragging it through the town? Strapping on a jetpack and dive-bombing the lowly humans? Wrecking studio of the developer that brought the game into existence? Pretty much anything you can imagine doing to terrorize and destroy the world is possible, and even if it's not built into the game Steam Workshop support makes it easy to add, giving you numerous methods to invoke chaos.\n\nPossibly more enjoyable than simply running around as a lunatic goat, is discovering all the hilarious Easter eggs that have been packed into the world. I won't spoil any of them here, but the amount of stuff that has been packed into what is actually a fairly small map, is rather impressive and had me laughing more than any other game of recent memory.\n\nOf the things Goat Simulator gets wrong, the spotty optimization is likely the most troubling. Despite what the modest system requirements would have you believe, there is a very good chance you'll have a hard time keeping a decent frame rate even on lowered settings. Hopefully this will be patched up, but as it stands expect middling to poor performance if you haven't just recently upgraded your PC.\n\nInevitably, there are going to be some people that look at Goat Simulator and write it off as just another dumb joke of a game. And to be honest, that's not entirely unfair. This is among the stupidest games ever released, and it makes no qualms about being as ridiculous as it possibly could be. But that's exactly what Goat Simulator is supposed to be, and the reason it's become so popular. In the wake of so many dark and serious games, something so silly and gleefully entertaining is refreshing, and has helped remind me of the biggest reason I play games in the first place: to have fun!\n\nReview Update\nNot content to sit comfortably on their mountain of money, Coffee Stain Studios has since put out a giant patch that effectively doubles the size of the game (if not more). A new map to explore, wall running and grapple hook mechanics, and an absolutely absurd multiplayer mode (local only unfortunately) have expanded Goat Simulator into a bigger and more enjoyable mammal wrecking ball, humanity terrorizing sandbox. It's a great addition to an already entertaining game, and hopefully is only the first of numerous additions to come.","April 7, 2014","true","8.7"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","31","44","0","0"

This joke has now snowballed into what may be the greatest game of all time. Just when you think it can't get any weirder, this game will blow your mind. It has references to nearly every geeky thing you can think of, from The IT Crowd to South Park to Bravest Warriors.\n\nA lot of games out there have stupid achievements. As a completionist, I feel compelled to 100% each game in my collection even though it kills me a little inside. With Goat Simulator, you can breeze through all the achievements in a few hours if that's what you want - the mutations make it super easy. But I didn't take the easy route. For all its frustrating bits, I wanted to do everything this game has to offer, and I wanted to do it legit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/265930/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Goat Simulator is an open world sandbox in the truest since of the word. There are no objectives, no story and not even the possibility of death. Just you and three large maps to explore and cause havoc in. As the name implies you play as a goat that escaped from it's pen. He is far from a normal goat though as he can run on walls, has an incredibly stick tongue and is incapable of death despite being near explosions or falling down absurd heights. This demigoat has no goals and is content just griefing the people that cross its path. The locations it comes across are all very strange and feature aliens, protesting of genital shaped food and a ton of memes. It is a very strange game that relies on you to make your own fun and gives you a comical world to explore with over the top rag-doll physics and tons of secret powers for your goat.\n\nMost of the fun comes from how over the top and wacky everything is as well as finding tons of easter eggs. You will never know what to expect around the corner and it is a ton of fun interacting with all the objects like tiny bottle rockets. The goat also has the power to slow down time so you can see the destruction you brought in slow motion. Completing small random events like winning in a goat  sumo match for example grants your goat super strength and that is probably the most sane power. Others let you summon blocks from Minecraft, get a grappling hook or even lets you make goats to rain out of the sky.  Bicycles are ride-able even though you are a goat though controlling it is near impossible. And that is a big part of what keeps this game so much fun, the sheer insanity of it all.\n\nOne of the three maps was introduced as free dlc and added actual objectives to the area. It is an MMO simulator where you start of by picking your class be it Mage, Rouge and even play as a Microwave along with a few other classes. Each class has their own unique attack and there is a leveling system. Leveling up does near nothing and doesn't really matter since you can't die. There is an inventory system in which you can carry around any object even other characters for later use. This map is very different than the rest as if features elves along with other magical races. The main theme of it is to take part in the long lasting and brutal war between sheep and goats. Though you do not have to take part in anything and can simply mess around like every other map.  One thing I would like to mention is how awesome the chat room in this map is.\n\nGraphics are pretty nice as the game is running on the Unreal 3 Engine. Music is very silly and off beat which I imagine would be either love it or hate it type of soundtrack. Physics are over the top and very fun to watch fly around though you may occasionally get your head stuck in objects and watching a goat climb a ladder is equally terrifying and hilarious. It features full controller support and up to four player local coop which is always a blast. Steam Workshop is also integrated into this title allowing you to download new maps, powers and even game-modes such as pinball. There is no blood, gore or even strong language. The most adult joke in this game that I have seen is the no phallic shaped food sign I mentioned earlier. It may be a pretty good title to play with your children since there is 4 player coop and no death only fun.\n\nIt is pretty buggy though nothing game-breaking, mostly just the physics spazzing out and objects being sent flying by the slightest touch. A score system is in place which you can increase by landing jumps and pretty much doing anything at all. It does nothing and is there just for the heck of it. You can not swim instead you glide along the water like a skipping stone until you reach land again. There are secrets in the water so don't write it off as an annoyance. The NPCs in this game are dumb as rocks and will occasionally get themselves injured though they always get back up. Simply tripping a person sends the community into a panic as they run around screaming due to a goat tripping a man. They have pretty short memories and will usually go back to dancing or whatever they happened to be doing before the goat so rudely tripped someone and is now over there licking a bicycle. That fiend.\n\nOverall this is a very strange title to recommend. It is fun for some and boring for others. I personally love it as it reminds me of the days of playing Tony Hawk's freeskate mode with a friend and just jumping over cars and performing insane tricks with no pesky timer only you, a mate and a entire city to cause chaos in. On the other hand I can see why people wouldn't like it as you are just thrown into the world with no objective, story or challenge to be found anywhere. This is definitely the type of game for those of us that spend our youth crashing toy cars instead of racing them, completely ignoring the missions in Grand Theft Auto or were watching action movies while everyone else was still watching Disney. If you fit any of those or just found the contents of this review interesting this game is likely for you.","May 8, 2015","true","13.3"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","21","30","2","1"

Some people may say I am taking the game to seriously, but I found it to be kind of a disapointment. First, the game's music is AWFUL. It's catchy at first, but then the same 10 notes over and over again gets REALLY old. Also, it gets boring very fast. Sure, you can play as tons of different "goats," but in my opinion, they don't really do anyting, they all seem bland, sure, some can jump higher or run faster, but it stil feels the same. Anyways, I found all the goats, (of what I know of,) in 2 hours or less. I cannot not tell you how boring it has gotten to run around the same map, for 25 minutes, head butting stuff and glitching in walls and tables, sounds fun, but it gets really boring. Now you may say, "Well we have the Workshop!" The thing about the Workshop is it hardly has anything. Sure, the game has only been out for 2 or 3 days, but seriously, the Workshop blows. Third, the game just seems unfinished. It does not feel this way because of the glitches, but because of how small the map is, and how some houses and stuff are not able to be broken into. Finally, the in-game achievments are EXTREMELY easy, I got all of  them in about, I'd say, and hour and a half? So in my opinion, this game is not worth the $10. (I believe this is 6.01 quid/punds?) You can say it's meant to be taken seriously, but neither is GMOD, and that's WAY better than this. But the Bay Turdles easter egg is very charming*\n\n\n"It's a joke that shouldn't be taken seriously, yet they want you to pay 10$ for it.\nHow is this game funny and original I really don't know, ragdolls and physics exist since more than 10 years ago. "lolo u can be a goat haters gonna hate lolxdd best game ever".\nNot to mention EVERY single positive review is like "You can be a goat, wow I learned how to goat, wow this is goaty 2014, wow this changed my life, wow I became a goat". -TheEngiGuy","April 2, 2014","false","6.0"," 242 of 436 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","242","436","0","18"

You take control of a goat in a small town with absurd physics. A simple headbutt from the goat will blow up a car. The goat can climb ladders effortlessly and drag objects around with its tongue. The town is basically a small sandbox with several hours of things to do, but not much more than that.\nGoat Simulator is small, deliberately unpolished and buggy and its design is simple. But it is a really funny joke, full of great physics-powered slapstick humor and unexpected surprises in every corner of its seemingly peaceful small-town map.\nIt is hard to recommend this game or even describe it, it is such a visual experience that you really should take a look at a video before buying and after that, either you want to move on, or you really need to play this game.\n\nSounds 4/10\nGraphics 7/10\nGameplay 8/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","April 5, 2014","true","24.3"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","21","31","0","0"

Education was always tough for me, I was never any good at sports, I was mediocre at best when it came to music, and making friends just wasn't there for me.\nOn May 16th I planned to take my life... It was raining outside, I took my Mom's SUV to the local state park near my house. The gate was locked so I just hopped over it with nothing but a rope. I found a nice big oak tree that would guarantee my demise, I tied the noose and put it around my neck while saying to myself "This is life has no meaning". IN the moment between life or death I was saved, my phone vibrated and I looked at the notification, "You have received a gift copy of Goat Simulator". This was a sign, the sign I was looking for. I ran back to the SUV and raced home with tears in my eyes because finally things were looking up.\nI ran upstairs and booted up my PC while nervously tapping my fingers. I downloaded the game while drinking myself drunk with Mountain Dew (diet I might add), and launched the game. I immediately broke down on my knees sobbing at the loading page because in that moment it told me "You are worth something, you mean something to me".\nAfter playing the game for a few hours I got a call from an old girlfriend asking if we could make things work, after a few more my Dad came to my room and told me he was going to stop drinking, and finally when I finished the game I walked outside and literally drowned in ♥♥♥♥♥ and hot pockets.\nWords can't express what this game has done to me, and I hope one day I will be able to repay this game for saving my life, but for now all I can say is; Thanks Goat Simulator....

In fact, this is a game that you will ervisit over and over, trying new things, trying to get seemingly impossible achievements until finding success, and generally just wreaking havoc along the way.

The Bay has a bit more glitchy imperfection at this point (I dare say, more than is intended), but I imagine the developers will continue to work on that particular area. Mostly though, when you encounter bugs in the Town, they are intended...or at least, they were intentionally left there to make the game even more quirky, lol.\n\nIt does have full controller support, which I appreciate.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 9 out of 10.

There is music and there is a bar.  At the bottom of the building the lift opens and let's something in.  About ten seconds later the lift opens at the top of the building and let's something out.  Who is it.  What is it.  Ah, it must be another partygoer arriving.  Actually, no.  It's a goat.  Your the goat.  It causes complete chaos head butting people smashing up the bar and jumping around like a maniac.  After causing even more damage to the party the goat jumps on to a powerful fan and it flies away to another place.  What's it going to do there.  Cause even more chaos.  Oh, you don't say!  Two minutes after the party was crashed by the goat, the partygoers notice a house with couches, tables and other strange objects flying out of the windows.  They also hear a strange baaing sound from inside the house.  It's the goat again.\n\nGoat Simulator is a great game.  There is really no aim to it apart from the explore the open world and to cause complete chaos.  There are eighty eight fun Steam achievements to unlock.  The achievements can go from dropping a massive boulder on a car that is zooming around a small dirt circuit to climbing a small tower that turns out to be the goat tower where there are many goats and they consider you royalty.  My favourite one is when a UFO comes and takes you into space.  Sorry for the spoilers but it was necessary to show off the awesomeness of Goat Simulator.  Don't worry I only mentioned three of the eighty eight achievements available.\n\nI completely recommend this game and I also recommend the three DLCs available.  For example the Goat Simulator: GoatZ DLC is amazing.  It has two new maps with a zombie survival mode and includes many extra things that your goat can do such as turning humans into zombies and making weapons out of things that are lying around.  Like a machine that shoots gum balls like a shot gun and causes the zombies to become multicoloured with the gum ball splat.  The Goat MMO Simulator is free and is great fun to play with friends.  The last DLC is the soundtrack and it is a bit weird to listen to but it's still cool.  I would rate it 89/100 because of it's awesomeness however it would be cool if the citizens would be more scared of you when you destroy their stuff.  So what are you waiting for?  Buy the game, strap yourself in and go for it.  Wait, did I say strap yourself in?  Yes I did.  You might need to as one of the goats has a jet pack.  Anyway, destroy everything in your path and cause chaos everywhere you go by head butting everything and everybody in sight.","January 6","true","10.2"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","15","22","7","1"

It is definately a great value for the price as I have had a blast playing this game with my four year old who finds the game as hilarious and silly as I do. He quickly learned how to play the game and has been enjoying the open world aspect of it (his favorite type of games). With Steam Workshop already in place and free content already annoumced, I look forward to see what is in store for this game with great delight.\n\nWhen I attempted to set up the controls for this game on a Steam Controller, I did not have much success. I hope to see that changed as I know it would increase how much fun I am having with the game. Better improvement for mods would be nice as it seems a number of them on Steam Workshop require a seperate installation of the game in 64bit. Thankfully the game does have a respawn function when game breaking glitches happen and you are left stranded in objects, in the ground, or in the air. With a game this zany, I would never expect realistic but a little bit better handling on the jumping in the game would be nice.\n\nOver all, this game is definately one of the best entertainment values I have stumbled upon in recent history.

You know the ones, with the same Helvetica Ultra Compressed Italic title font, that offer bogglingly realistic looks at, say, farming, or truck driving, or other very specific career tracks. After doing a bit of research, it would seem to be a split between younger kids, for whom the rough-and-ready big machines appeal is strong, young adults looking into the subject at hand as a possible career idea, and middle-aged guys with a personal connection to the industry in question. Perhaps you want to be a construction worker, or a farmer, or a train engineer, or perhaps you were one once upon a time, before you took that arrow to the knee. Nonetheless, mocked as they tend to be by gamers, these games sell well, so obviously they have a market and they meet its needs.\n\nI suppose I'm wondering, then, if I'm a hyperannuated child who dreams of being a goat, a hyperannuated young adult considering a career in being a goat, or a middle-aged man who missed his calling to become a goat, and turns to this game to fulfill an unrequited dream of the yesterday I now can only wish I'd pursued while I was still young and vital, and all paths, including, one must presume, becoming a full-time goat, were available to me. (I'll leave the navel-gazing about my inner longhorn for another review.)\n\nWhichever of these *you* may be, however, I suspect you will be well satisfied by this game. Inasmuch as you have any latent, unrealized dreams of being a belligerent ungulate loose in a city's-edge suburb, this simulation will surely help you to actualize them. I'm really impressed by its quality; Coffee Stain claims this is a two-week coder-doodle, but I'm genuinely blown away by the realism, the attention to detail, and the care and craftsmanship of every nuance of my caprine second-life. The transition from trot to gallop shows not only an eye for physics, but an emotional journey for the protagonist, from gaining momentum to finding the rhythm of hooves and stabilizing the new run. It is one thing to create a game that merely *depicts* a goat running; it is another to immerse the player into the experience of being a running goat. I was, well and truly, a running goat, as I played. I felt the years melt away; I have no idea how many, nor whether they were human years or goat years, or what the exchange rate between them might be. I was too busy being a goat to care.\n\nThis is a sandbox game. If you're looking for direction, you're welcome to follow the achievements trees and let them inspire you, but you need not even pay attention. In the course of your immersive goating, you will surely unlock more and more achievements, just by doing what comes naturally. Don't be afraid to bleat, or "baah" as the game calls it; your bleats are limited only by your desire to bleat, and this isn't some kind of goat-themed roleplaying game; you need not wait for your bleat meter to replenish to do it again. Timing headbutts during a charge can be tricky, yes, but again, this is not a goat-themed action game, it's a *simulation*. You'll get the hang of it soon enough, just keep trying. Don't worry, there are many, many things to butt, stomp, scatter and abuse.\n\nWhile you can certainly play the game in metadialogue with the protagonist, imagining yourself merely a spectral guide inspiring a goat who is not, in fact, yourself to move, bleat, butt, and grab things with a curiously elastic froglike tongue -- this is a mystery of goathood of which I had been previously unenlightened, and it was a surprise to me -- you will surely enjoy the game more if you let the simulation run wild in your imagination. For those of us without years of Stanislavsky Method training, this is well and truly our golden ticket into the mind, horns and hooves of the goat. Embrace the goat. Become one with the goat. To do less would be to fail to actualize the potential of this masterpiece of simulation.\n\nI ran as a goat. I headbutted as a goat. I climbed as a goat. I climbed *ladders* as a goat. And when that truck barreled out of the tunnel toward me, I didn't look up at it and see a giant rolling metal deathbringer. Oh no. I was a *goat*, baby, and all I saw was a rival in full charge. I bleated. I lowered my head. And I charged that sorry Peterbilt with the mightiest butt I could manage. Were there a nanny goat present, I would have surely emerged the dominant male from that challenge!\n\nI can't really speculate as to how well this game prepares one for becoming a goat professionally, as I have no plans to use this simulation as career training, as many do. Since it bears the textual laurels of the Helvetica Ultra Compressed Italic font on its cover and splash screen, however, I am fully confident that, like the mighty Microsoft Flight Simulator before it, it will prove useful to goats-in-training, although it may require specialized input hardware for a more realistic experience, as MSFS did. (I have no idea what specialized goat-simulation hardware looks like, maybe some of you awesome hardware experts can help me here.)\n\nI was not aware that I yearned to life a double life as a goat before playing this simulation game. After playing it, I remain no more convinced, really, that I ever wanted to be a goat. But if I did want to be a goat, this simulation would well and truly satisfy that desire in a deep, meaningful, lasting, and enlightening way. I can recommend this game not only to would-be goats, but even to those merely curious about what their lives might have been like, if they had chosen to be goats. I can even recommend the game to those who are merely curious as to what "being a goat" entails, and I suspect that the many souls who plunk down ten bucks just to see what all the fuss is about will want away both entertained and a little wiser.\n\nThe line between simulation and reality becomes more and more fuzzy with every passing year. I shudder to think how many concussions this game could virtually induce if Oculus Rift support appears, down the line. The goat of tomorrow has finally arrived.

I make no apologies for saying that's enough to sell it to me. But is the game any good? What does it do? Is it worth buying (being perhaps the ultimate question)?\n\nLet's tackle what it is. Well, it says on the tin, as it were. It's a sandbox bugger-about (if that isn't a genre it damned well should be). Your goat emulates Tony Hawk in a rather straightforward (but oddly-sounding) way - you can jump, flip, headbutt, and lick - the latter which allow you to pick things up and wander around with them, flailing-weapon-like. As already stated, it's a free-for-all bugger around in a sandbox townscape. There are some collectables to find, game mode tweaks to unlock, and special tricks (usually with accompanying in-jokes) to perform; the latter being the real meat of the game.\n\nIs it any good, though? Yes and no.\n\nAs before, it's patently obvious what it is, but the real downsides are that there is so little content here. The single environment is sadly very small, so you can easily find every nook and cranny therein within a couple of hours. But, somewhat worse, it does tend to tire some time before that; in other words, the chuckles wear thin fairly quickly, as they do with any joke once heard or experienced the first time. So, in such cases, you NEED something else to offer to fall back on, and sadly there just isn't enough for that.\n\nThe tricks you need to perform (they are sequential, so you need to perform a given trick successfully before the next one appears) can also be romped through in short shrift, especially once you quickly work out the best places for performing them.\n\nSo, the final question, is it worth buying? Well, the answer isn't really straightforward as it entirely depends on your own perspective.\n\nIf you are OK with a couple of hours at best of silly entertainment, and the price is acceptable, then by all means go for it. It is what it is. The only warning I will add to this is to be prepared for some bad framerate issues - it isn't optimized at all at this point. My main desktop (a couple of years old) will potter along acceptably, if you consider drops to 30 FPS acceptable when you've busted up a few things (which means frequently). On my laptop which is above minimum recommended specs, forget it. 10 FPS is about it. That's the only real thing to beware.\n\nHowever, if you are a little more careful and considered with your purchases, then I would offer you a firm "no" for buying it - at least not yet.\n\nThere's a couple of major reasons I say not yet. Firstly, the obvious one being as with all things Steam, a sale is imminent and there will be promotion soon enough. Secondly, from my experience with Coffee Stain studios, they are generally good guys. I bought Sanctum when it released, and the content was 3 (or maybe 4) maps at that time, but they added and updated repeatedly right up to the time before Sanctum2's release, so as far as money's-worth I DEFINITELY got it, as all this content was free. Their DLC was generous too, as they asked what we wanted to see as DLC and listened - so maps, in general, and they were well priced.\n\nI have no doubt they'll be adding to this game (and as of today have confirmed more free content for May), so it will improve. There is also the point that it has Steam Workshop support, and mods have been coming in pretty quick already, so I have no doubt this will be pretty well supported and will grow.\n\nSo in summary, I'd urge to wait and get it in a couple of months.","April 9, 2014","true","3.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

This is not a simulator of true goat life. This game is more like the Dark Souls of goat simulation and could be the deepest non-linear action rpg of our time.\n\nYou start out in an open field with perhaps the most cliched of beginings, the amnesiac hero. Much in the vein of dark souls you know little about the world to begin with and will learn more through close observation of details. What's the deal with the standing stone circle? Who is behind the sinister experiments in the anti gravity science facilty? These are questions that you'll answer in your journey along with many more.\n\nNarrative is driven purely through your interactions with npcs. This is some of the best npc interaction I have seen as each npc has their own digital life and routine and they will remember your past interactions. Did you headbutt Kyle earlier? Well he's staying headbutted. The only gripe I have with the NPCs is that the AI is particularly poor and they only react directly to the player rather than to the world around them. However due to the non-linear nature of the game and story, this should be forgiven.\n\nGraphics are great and highly stylised. The world is vibrant and full of colour, making it easy to distinguish objects on screen. Likewise, the music is perfect and even contextual, ramping up at times of extreme action.\n\nFinal word: Simple to learn, difficult to master with engaging gameplay and a deep and compelling non-linear narrative, Goat Simulator is a modern day classic and a must buy for all gamers, casual or hardcore.\n\nScore: 10/Goat","March 30, 2014","true","8.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","4"

Goat/10.\nGoat Simulator 2014 gives an in-depth experience that uses a wide range of engaging stimulus and challenges to educate us humans of the agricultural environment that a goat must endure through it's life. The inspiring story of Goat overcoming his/her oppressors (the humans) creates an amazing storyline, with numerous plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat. I know what you're thinking, "but its just a goat!" Shut the hell up you fool, although this may be 'just a goat', this is 'just a goat' that broke through its goat expectations and stereotypes to face the world with nothing but its hyper-elastic tongue and it's oddly unnatural ability to not die. Ever. Goat Simulator 2014 expertly demonstrates how political views and actions can affect not only mankind, but also goats. It confronts the player with many terrifying situations (and can at times cause great offense). One example of this is the many rules and regulations imposed by the goverment, like what the hell? You want to keep me in this goat pen? Do you think this tower will keep me happy? This game allows you to fight the power, and essentially "♥♥♥♥ the police". The most controversial aspect of this game is most definitely the goat fight scene, where you must turn against your fellow goats for the pleasure of the humans. Who really wants to participate in a competitive blood bath of goats for someone else's entertainment? In my honest opinion, I would much rather prefer that to not be a part of the game. Although I may not be condoning goat on goat violence, I find mowing down the many so called 'innocent' civilians and sacrificing them to the Lord Satan gives me an enjoyable rush. This game has the potential to inspire many, whether they want to become a goat scientist, goat gymnast, goat astronaut, goat ball pitcher or whale, they will find this game absolutely enthralling. The Good Goat VS Bad Goat dynamic of Goat Simulator gives the player the ability to influence the goat's decisions, and essentially determine to be Good Goat, or Bad Goat. (I also have the sneaking suspicions that recent games such as Infamous: SECOND SUN (what does that even mean?) have copied this genius game mechanic from Goat Simulator 2014.)\n\nI recommend this game as it accurately depicts the various aspects of survival that a goat must face in it's day to life, and does so in a way that us humans can relate to and take advice from in both an entertaining and interesting way. This game forces you to think. I love it.\n","April 4, 2014","true","5.6"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","2"

On a biological level this can be answered easily, but it becomes harder to answer as we approach it more philosphically.  Is life not constructed of the same matter as the rest of the universe?  Does a dead body not have the same amount of atoms as a living body?  Can you measure the soul?  Is sentience, nay, is consciousness something a living being can truly attain?  In the face of the infinite void of the universe, can a human claim to know anything at all?  Can a human truly understand anything, or is all of our culture and history nothing more than the filthy residue of our species' unending drive to eat, ♥♥♥♥, and kill?  Can any man claim to be superior to another man, to an ape, a goat, a snake, an ant?  Should we as a species be proud of our dominance over the Earth?  Have we, through our actions, proven to be noble and gracious caretakers of the only home we have?  I think not.  No, a man is nothing more than an unthinking beast with ersatz free will.  Mankind is a nuclear wolf wearing the skin of God, barking at itself in the mirror in a locked room full of its own excrement. Barking louder and louder, bared fangs slobbering radioactive saliva, until it's idiotic madness causes it's own heart to detonate.\n\nIt is time to remove the mask of yourself.  Rip away the insincere facade of humanity from your ego.  Your leg is caught in the beartrap of society, and if you don't gnaw your leg off your spirit will starve to death.  Become the beast you already know you should be, deep down inside, and the taste in your mouth won't be your own blood, it will be the taste of freedom.

Games like Super Mario Bros, Doom, Final Fantasy, and now Goat Simulator.\n\n….. ok not really but it is a game about being a goat and you get to go destroy things, so it's still pretty awesome. Just finished my first run through (and trust me I ran through a lot of stuff XD) and I enjoyed it, for something so silly it is surprisingly fun. A lot of hidden things to find and hidden jokes if you take the time to look around. And you can always reset the world and try destroying things differently. Not to mention it has workshop support so who knows what the community will add.  If you want a fun crazy goat related experience that you can play over and over just go ahead and slap down 10 bucks and enjoy yourself, after all you may be a goat in your next life better be prepared!*\n\n*(Reincarnation is not necessarily the belief of the reviewer, nor is he saying that this is in fact true or false.

Sure it looks cute and fun with its silly goat protagonist and a general goofyness to the world. But there are only two area's in the game and if you don't have a fantastic comuter this game runs like s***. To add on top of it the people in game are irritatating. Sure, it might be funny to hear "I was sacrifice by that goat!" ONCE. But when they repeat it over and over It just makes everyone else in the game to seem like lifeless puppets. Though not entirely related to the review the scream they use in the game must be some sort of royalty free scream because I've heard it in other games like SCP Containment Breach. And trust me, once you played that the scream does not fit in this game at all.\n\nOverall I just felt like I was getting achviements and had no other goal or fun thing to do other then that.

We just played...for fun, spending hours playing certain games with no MP features just because they were great fun to play. These days, most games fail hardly at meeting that demand, half the time the games we play these days are MP, and we only do so to `get to the next level` or `unlock the next item` or we paly them simply because our friends are playing them.\n\nThis game is unique, it succesfully fills that cliche of just being a thing to play on your own, for fun!\n\nHowever that said, there are some negatives. The map feels small, and the current stuff to do is fairly limiting. Providing the game gets updated with little bits of content from the workshop or the devs, I'm sure this game will continue to thrive, and remain my favourite 15 minute time killer.\n\nAlso, the lack of being able to eat grass and poop is disturbing for a goat simulator.

Everyone praises this game, hail goat simulater! Lol 10 of- lol so random funny lol glitchy random funny lol ten random funny lol yolo! This game isn't funny, it really isn't if I can quote NerdCubed here "This game isn't YOLO it's LOLO, laugh out loud once, at one point you'll laugh once "Heh, man fell down" and thats it." And it's true, the main punchline, man fell down, game is teh glitch, and you may chuckle... Once, then after that this game just keeps pushing, and pushing, and PUSHING thats same joke down you ♥♥♥♥ing throat as you choke to death on a man falling down, and random glitches. The 1 defense is: "Oh, but it's supposed to be glitchy, it's parodying ♥♥♥♥♥♥ simulators" No! No no no! You see, if you try to make a bad game and succeed, then you've made a bad game (another Nerd3 quote) This game isn't parodying anthing, it's just adding to the pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ "Simulators" This is a game that was funny to some 12 year old, and then once Pewdiepie played it, the cult leader of the braindead 12 year old, "lol yolo 10 funny ranomd lol!" gang.\n\nBasically, you know that one kid at any school, that said some "Joke" that he thought was funny, wether it be towards someone or not, he said that "Joke" and one kid barley chuckled, and something clicks "Oh my god, someone- someone ♥♥♥♥ing laughed, I must be the funniest person ever!" And then every. Single. Day, he just said, and said, and said that joke over and over and over and over an over again.

It's a pain trying to control the goat and get it to do what you want it to. The game itself is also pretty glitchy.\n\nThe joke wears thin very fast, which is the game's main selling point. I mean, there's only so many times you can watch a goat blow up. The worst thing about it is the price. In no way is this game worth £7.

(and have ten bucks you dont care about spending)\n\nIt has one of the funniest physics I've ever seen and you can do pretty much anything you want. I reccomend playing with friends, it will almost quadruple the amounts of laughs you get otherwise. Its a sandbox game, there is no end so it's no surprise if you get bored after a week (or less, depends on what kind of person you are). Trying to get higher scores, finding easter eggs and trying to get all the achievements always leaves you wanting to play somemore.\n\nAnd the Acrobatics/Parkour mechanics are SO much fun. jump from roof to roof, wall climb, wall jump, do 360-backflips, and walk on your front legs. Its so challenging and fun to run across the maps parkouring on everything, even vehicles.\n\nBut If you're worried that it will only provide you with a very short amount of entertainment and dont want to spend more money buying the DLCs, you can download mods and maps people made on the steam workshop! (or even make mods)\n\nThis game is a masterpiece to be honest.\n\nBasically, Goat Simulator is a low-budget (yet amazing) GTA-like indie game by Coffee Stain Studios. If the devs are reading this, know that I love ya'll and support your amazing work! (especially Mikael!)\n\n10/10, Definitely worth the 10 bucks. buy it.

BUT can you goat the goat?\n\nGoat Simulator is a game of adventure, love, heartbreak, suspense, murder, and any other type of genre you can think of. You play as an indebted detective known as Bookshelf DeGoat sent on a mission by the iconic lettuce triplets to bring them the girl and wipe away the debt. You jump in a rocket and fly up to the floating haven (and by haven I mean sweat shop) of Alaska. Once there you will begin to notice the high amounts of patriotism and overpriced T-shirts manufactured by Starbucks. You learn about their leader, Celery Q. Cumquat, you enter a raffle then win only to find out you are known as the False Sheep. You fight hordes and hordes of Cumquat's men to reach the girl known as Goatlizabeth. As the duo run around the city of Alaska Goatlizabeth is shown to have supernatural powers to open ripples in space-time simply referred to as tears.\n\nI could go on about the plot but I won't spoil the rest of it for you.

It is so refreshing to just have a game to play in, have a silly time with, and just see what you can get away with doing.

It's huge in every sense of the word - long, hard (that's what she said :P) and has a level of freedom you wouldn't expect from a game more than ten years old. You can do pretty much everything you want - sleep, grill meat, forge weapons, make potions, skin animals and take their teeth and even smoke pot and sell it for profit - and go anywhere you want in the game's world without a quest asking you to go there.\nThe sun rises and sets, NPC sleep, wake up, work, gather to talk with each other, etc. etc.\nBeing a simulator, the development of the character is always important in such a genre, and Goat simulator really shines in that department. You start as a poor weakling who gets beaten up by everyone and hardly can kick harmless little creatures called meatbugs. Then, as you complete quests and defeat enemies, you gain XP which can be converted in strength, dexterity and mana points. You go all the way to a badass warrior, a lethal ranger or a supreme mage - you chose how you want to play it.\nAs for the bad parts, I just can think of one: the game is VERY buggy, and that can totally ruin your game experience if you don't know how to avoid it.\n\nA few important considerations about the game if you want to play and enjoy it:\n\n- Steam doesn't provide a game manual for Goat sim, and that truly sucks. If there are some games which you can start playing without reading the manual first - most modern games carry in-game tutorials - this is NOT one of them. The controls are a bit akward and if you don't read about them first I guarantee you won't be able to play the game at all. Just visit the Steam community page and you'll easily find a link to download the official manual in PDF.\n\n- You can and you SHOULD run the game on Windows 7. My desktop computer is a Pentium IV with Windows XP, and I thought It would be better choice for this game to avoid system compatibility issues. Well, that was a mistake. The game kept crashing anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes of gameplay, especially when facing multiple foes, not to mention some inventory items didn't even show the picture. I googled it and updated all my Nvidia and sound card drivers, but the problems aforementioned remained unchanged. I was very close to quit playing the game at all, but I thought what the heck, let me try it on my laptop which runs on W 7. It got A LOT better. It only crashed about 10% of the time (ah ah), especially during the first visit to the Sleeper's temple (be sure to save a lot there) and the inventory issue got fixed. I don't know about Vista or 8, but the game seems to like Windows 7. Oh, and make sure to disable Steam interface during gameplay, or the game might not start at all.\n\n- The game allows you to save whenever you want, so make sure you take advantage of it. I suggest this not for cheating purposes, but to avoid losing your game progress due to a crash or even worse, some bug where a gate doesn't open when it was supposed to or you end up killing NPCs vital to the plot who shouldn't be allowed to die at that point of the game.\n\n- Get a walkthrough. I suggest the one by JemyM, which you can easily find online. Again, I recommend it not for cheating (you can even skip the walkthrough part per se) but for the unvaluable information it contains regarding gameplay and common bugs and how to avoid them.\n\n- Go to a place like steamcommunity.com and download the map pictures. Trust me, you will need them.\n\n- If you're more into action games, maybe this game is not for you. Through most part of the game (especially the first chapters), you keep running from place to place around the colony, doing chores for other people, looking for objects, etc. Sure, later you'll feel like an invencible killing machine - it felt VERY rewarding going back to the Old Camp and slaughtering all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who mugged me in the beginning :P - but it takes a while to get there.

The game kept crashing anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes of gameplay, especially when facing multiple foes, not to mention some inventory items didn't even show the picture. I googled it and updated all my Nvidia and sound card drivers, but the problems aforementioned remained unchanged. I was very close to quit playing the game at all, but I thought what the heck, let me try it on my laptop which runs on W 7. It got A LOT better. It only crashed about 10% of the time (ah ah), especially during the first visit to the Sleeper's temple (be sure to save a lot there) and the inventory issue got fixed. I don't know about Vista or 8, but the game seems to like Windows 7. Oh, and make sure to disable Steam interface during gameplay, or the game might not start at all.\n\n- The game allows you to save whenever you want, so make sure you take advantage of it. I suggest this not for cheating purposes, but to avoid losing your game progress due to a crash or even worse, some bug where a gate doesn't open when it was supposed to or you end up killing NPCs vital to the plot who shouldn't be allowed to die at that point of the game.\n\n- Get a walkthrough. I suggest the one by JemyM, which you can easily find online. Again, I recommend it not for cheating (you can even skip the walkthrough part per se) but for the unvaluable information it contains regarding gameplay and common bugs and how to avoid them.\n\n- Go to a place like steamcommunity.com and download the map pictures. Trust me, you will need them.\n\n- If you're more into action games, maybe this game is not for you. Through most part of the game (especially the first chapters), you keep running from place to place around the colony, doing chores for other people, looking for objects, etc. Sure, later you'll feel like an invencible killing machine - it felt VERY rewarding going back to the Old Camp and slaughtering all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who mugged me in the beginning :P - but it takes a while to get there. Play this game for the RPG experience and the story, and you will enjoy it.","April 20, 2014","true","10.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This meant removing ony crash bugs because the bugs made people chuckle, allowing the player to break the game, making advanced physics calculations such as turning the goat's neck into spaghetti, and the list goes on. Its sole purpose is to be worth its $10 by making the player ♥♥♥♥ himself/herself in laughter. From going down a waterslide in ragdoll, to going to space, to latching onto a hillbilly's car with your tongue and clotheslining innocent bystanders, to blowing up a gas station.

Buy Lag Simulator!\n\nFrom the developer Coffee Stain Studios comes the wonderful game Lag Simulator! This piece of brilliance is sure to make all of your goals in life to come to fruition.\nMany people suffer from a lack of will or horrible procrastination and so cannot get themselves to do anything with their lives but to stay at home and game, hiding behind the safe veil of their screen.\nAnd that is where Lag Simulator comes in to save the day!\nThis game will create such an immense lag on your pc or laptop that you can’t do anything at all but stare at your screen! Yes, that’s right: only staring at your screen! And that’s when you’re still at the menu! I’ve played this game for 75 minutes and all of that time was spent waiting for the game to actually start! How lag! Truly a wonderful piece of art!\n\nNeedless to say, I’ve never had more fun playing a game.\n\nHowever, staring blankly at my unmoving screen gave me a certain feeling.. A feeling of productivity.  Odd, I know!  But during those 75 minutes of Lag Simulator I got inspired..  Scary, yes.  Inspired to do something. And since my screen wasn’t working (nor anything else since Lag Simulator lags the whole system!) I decided to do something with my life!\nSo passionately (Yes, passion! ) I began reading once again. I now know how to better massage people with oils and special techniques and all that. All of this thanks to Lag Simulator!\nI, for one, recommend buying Lag Simulator if you really want to succeed in life!\n\nFor anyone not yet convinced to buy this superb game, take a look at what the developer said about it on their site:\n“Lag Simulator is a small, broken and stupid game. It was made in a couple of weeks so don’t expect a game in the size and scope of GTA with goats. In fact, you’re better off not expecting anything at all actually. To be completely honest, it would be best if you’d spend your $10 on a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe a real-life goat.”\n\nApparently Lag Simulator has goats too.

And unlike 90% of all other boring or pointless simulators this was going to be a magical game. An open world sand box of pure physics. (Though now it is some kind of... random MMO, Platforming, RPG... thing.) And with that the young man set out with an idea in his mind and a goat *pause* screaming in his heart.\n\n(This is just what I think happened.

I understand that the main goal of this game are open world havoc for fun. There're a lot of silly effects and you can do funny things. But I didn't get the fun. I'm totally bored with the game, and it gets worst with the MMO Simulator update.I understand that they're trying to add something to do in-game rather than just pointlessly creating ruckus in the middle of the town. I guess that's just because there's nothing to do ? I'm not the achievement kind of guy. I don't really care about pursuing achievements since it gives you nothing. The graphics are okay, the gameplay is rather pointless, and I think the game's effort to give me fun is a huge fail. I saw a lot of positive reviews from other people and most of them don't play for long. This game is best fit to fill your free time when you're bored playing anything. But if you're also bored of crazy goats,walking toilets and two-legged microwave, this game will become totally useless.\n\nNote : Please,people.Do not give thumbs down to my review only because I didn't recommend your beloved game.Everyone has their right to express their opinion about the game in the review section.Remember the thumbs up or down is about whether my review is HELPFUL or NOT.It's not about whether I recommend a game you like or not.What's the point of rating my review if you love the game ? Why are you reading reviews if you love the game ? Why do you even read reviews when you ALREADY have the game ? I suppose a lot of people intentionally giving thumbs down because they hate people who aren't recommending a game they like.Maybe they're trying to cover up the bads of the game ? My review is for the people who don't know what kind of game is this and I want to help them to decide whether to buy this game or not.THAT is the purpose of a review.I truly hope you people are educated enough to comprehend this and STOP giving bad ratings to reviews that don't recommend a game you like.","November 26, 2014","false","2.0"," 52 of 96 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","52","96","0","5"

The game is, as far as I can tell, the premium representation of farm life, in terms of goats, and shows the perfect flow of the life-cycle of the goat itself; doing stunts off of explosive cars is just an example of such things you can experience in this third-person open-world goat-em-up.\n\nAll jokes aside, Goat Simulator is a collaborative effort by the guys at Coffee Stain which takes pride in it's stupendous outrageousness, your goat can get a jetpack and fly around the packed, albeit small, map that it calls it's home, or would you rather drop peasant goats from the sky as the queen of all that is goaty? Want to imbue the powers of the Goat Devil himself into a singularity of goat *I mean "out"* of this world proportions? You can do that. Or just interested in floppin' it up with the new-fangled "ragdoll-key"? Why not?!  When it comes to it, Goat Simulator is a buggy mess, and it embraces that- it's advertised as a "feature".\n\nHowever, while Goat Simulator's joke is very funny (or terrible, depending on your kind of humour) it can quickly go stale, after playing for about an hour, the lack ofthings to do has been getting to me, there are modifiers you can use, but there are very limited amounts of them. Goat Sim relies on experimentation but after a while there really isn't much to experiment with.\n\nIt's hard to review a game like Goat Simulator, while it's a glitch-filled, ugly, and very small world, it uses that to it's advantage, the devs would say "It's buggy but who cares because it's meant too be like that?" and honestly I don't know whether to applaud or condemn Coffee Stain for that. At it's best Goat Simulator is a hilarious monstrosity but at it's worst it descends into monotony. I believe that the Steam Workshop will keep this game alive, however it requires a motive for modding in the first place, and at the price it's at, I don't think it'll get much of that. Goat Simulator is £6.99 here in the UK or around $9.99 USD or €8.99 EUR. Personally, I'd wait until it came down in price if you're interested in some goat based action.\n\nI can't really reccomend this game but I can't push you away from it. If you're good with slapstick generally silly humour then this might be for you, if not then keep a watch for major price drops. I'd reccomend waiting anyway.

There is no other game in the entire universe, from now until the end of time that will compare to the greatness that is this game.\n\nYou may say to yourself "My my, this is a big claim you're making. Exactly what is it about this game that makes it so great?". Well, let me tell you a story.\n\nBack when I was 11 years old, I was at school (bear in mind it was a rural area too, so there was lots of fields and farm animals around). I was in class, staring out the window, distracting myself from the boring lessons I had to endure. Sometimes, I would stare out into the fields and sky, contemplating what it would feel like to be out there, totally free to run around as a goat. I often pretended I was a goat at home, when I was alone in my beadroom, running around in circles destroying all of my toys, video games and things in my closet. This felt like it was representing the urge to release myself from the house I was living in and roam around in nature with all the other animals.\n\nFor about 10 years since then, I was told to suppress my urge to become a goat. My parents didn't want to continuously purchase new toys and games for me to play with (which in hindsight was fair enough too, considering they would break every time I acted like a goat), and during that time, I felt alone. No one was around to understand how I felt. The urge to run around completely naked as a goat, breaking everything, was all but a distant memory, a shadow of my former self that I regretted to have. For a time, I nearly forgot about doing it at all.\n\nThat was until this game came along.\n\nI played it, and played and played it. It changed by life. All the old feelings and urges came flooding back to me as soon as I started licking cars as they drive by. The wrecking of people's houses reminding me of those times as a kid when I would do the same thing in my bedroom. It felt like the developers truly understood how I feel, after all these years searching for someone who had the same hopes and dreams as me.\n\nAs a result of playing this game, I have now started organizing meetups at night for likeminded people, and we run on all fours throughout the night, around the fields near my old school amongst other goats. Luckily we can get away with making goat noises when we're surrounded by them. No one seems to notice, thankfully. I hope, at one point, we can run through our nearest city as goats at some point, even if it's in goat costumes.\n\nAnd that is why I think this is the greatest game of all time. If anyone at Coffee Stain Studios reads this, I am personally thanking you for becoming an inspiration for me to create the new 'Goaty' fandom.\n\nSincerely,\nBob","April 1, 2014","true","5.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

Somehow, gaming's oldest mascot is delivering one of the most exciting games of the year. More mazes, more modes, more ghosts...lots more ghosts, actually. This "deluxe" version takes everything that made Championship Edition great and adds a bunch of cool new stuff. It's like taking a great white shark and adding laser beam eyes and saw blades that shoot out of its mouth.\n\nPac-Man Championship Edition DX is all about gunning for a high score. Games are timed, so you need to eat as many pellets, fruits, and ghosts as possible before the clock stops. You don't die as often as you did in the original Pac-Man, you earn plenty of extra lives, and you have many bombs at your disposal to get out of tight spots. (Yes, Pac-Man can now trigger bombs that send all of the ghosts back to their hideout.) Without much fear of death, you can focus on the one thing that matters: representing on the online score boards.\n\nPac-Man now has many more ghosts to contend with. Like, a hundred more. You'll see the spirits sleeping around a maze, and as Pac-Man whizzes by they'll wake up and give chase. Hold off on eating a Power Pellet long enough and you may find dozens of ghosts trailing behind you in a long conga line. Finally grabbing that Power Pellet and devouring a hundred ghosts in a row is one of the most satisfying things I've done in a game this year. This is also a key technique in getting those high scores.\n\nWhile the first Championship Edition was super fun, there were only a couple of mazes and modes. DX has nine mazes, most of which are new creations that offer a lot of variety. For example, Spiral has several coils that are easy to get trapped in. Dungeon, on the other hand, has long, cramped corridors. Each maze also has many game options such as Score Attack, Time Trials, and Ghost Combos (see how many ghosts you can eat with one Power Pellet). When you first dive into Championship Edition DX, only the standard Championship II course is unlocked, but each round you play usually unlocks a new maze or mode.\n\nLike I said, it's all about the high score, and Championship Edition DX provides many friendly ways to see how you rank against the competition. You can comb through the leaderboards for extensive data on all the many maps and modes, but there are other really nice touches: your current ranking is displayed right on the title screen, the Course Select screen, and again within the menu for each maze.\n\nPac-Man Championship Edition DX also looks and sounds great. You can select from a variety of maze skins and character designs for each game, running from the 3D Pac-Mania characters to pixilated retro sprites. The lively electronic soundtrack builds in intensity as the game timer ticks down and always gets me leaning forward in my chair.\n\nTHE VERDICT\nPac-Man Championship Edition DX boasts simple, addictive gameplay that will have you competing for high scores on the score boards for months. Everything that made the first game a hit is still here, accompanied by a bunch of new mazes, modes, and ghosts -- all for $10. It's hard to imagine a more perfect PlayStation Network game. This is a master class in game design: you will understand it instantly, enjoy it instantly, and want to play again and again.\n\n\n\n\n\n10/10 like skyrim but with guns","April 2, 2014","true","17.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Crashing through a house, swinging the grill into every posession they owned, I got a start on my revenge before getting stuck in a wall.\nMy tongue slapped into a nearby car, and in an act of rebellion, the driver took off without any warning. Flipping around without any control, I let go and flew into the sky, and landed by a nearby gas station. Flying into it at high speeds, this was how it ended for my journey. In a burst of light, I was set off sky high.\n\nThe world then looked so small from thousands of feet in the sky. I knew there was no stopping, and I was fine with that. Going out of the skybox and past the inter-dimensional plain, I hoped that what I had done had inspired goats from now on. Everything then went white.\n\nIt's a neat game.","March 28, 2014","true","22.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Goats.  Our world pays so little homage to this creature, but this game does such a perfect job as to underline the importance of it in our modern world.  This game does an amazing job at answering important questions pertaining to life, the universe, and everything.\nThe game itself is nothing short of a masterpiece.  Out of the plethora of games in the genre, this is, by far, the best goat simulation game I've ever played.  The realism in it is absolutely stunning, from the revolutionary next-gen graphics to the pinpointed level of realism achieved.  Goat Simulator is a must-play for any gamer, as well as anyone else, human or goat.","March 29, 2014","true","15.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a bit pricey, however, what I don't think people understand is that there are going to be a few free updates with more content and there is a workshop and a full SDK for the game. The workshop is slowly getting content and a new update is going to be in May including a new map. I've completed every challenge and gained every achievement, yet I find myself coming back to the game even after 18 hours. If you are willing to give a bit of cash to support some independent developers and to have fun and laugh at some incredible glitches I'd say buy this game.","April 8, 2014","true","55.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/laughinggas/recommended/265930/","laughinggas","Leffles the Magnificent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/laughinggas/","1347 products in account","Goat Simulator is a very difficult game for me to review. There's just so many good things about it, and so many bad things about it. Essentially, as a full-blown game, I can't really recommend it. But as a toy akin to Little Inferno, something that you just start up in your spare time for a quick romp, I have to say it's probably the best in the business.\n\nLet's start with overall gameplay. There isn't much variety in what you can do, but what you can do is just downright fabulous. The whole "game" is pretty much a "mess around with physics" thing. You can go around and headbutt/kick people around, watch bodies spaz out and/or fly around, and you can even use your super-strength tongue to grab a hold of almost everything. You could latch onto a car and run around with it! Pretty much everything you can do results in you getting points for certain quests or for the sake of getting points. Do a flip? There's some points. Blow up a gas station? There's some points for that. Sacrifice a robot to Satan? Well here's some points for your troubles. There's a few fun items strewn out around the map, like a few fireworks that launch you up into the air, and a treadmill for a little excruciating workout. There's also a ton of trampolines/matresses to bounce around on. Frankly, I spent more time bouncing around on trampolines than anything else in the "game". You've also got a handful of quests that span from getting a large score, a large score combo, or just finding locations/trophies. Obviously, these quests are finished fairly quickly with the exception of the score quests, which don't take much effort, especially if you've unlocked the Angel goat.\n\nFortunately, if you're bored with tossing civilians down water slides and blowing up cars, there's a bunch of mini-missions for you to do as well! These mini-missions range from sacrificing humans to Satan to goat sumo wrestling. There aren't many, though, and they don't last long, but there's 2 more noteable mini-missions that could keep you playing longer than you intended to. The 2 mini-missions being Time Trial and Flappy Goat. The goal of Time Trial is to get as many points as you can (in normal goat form). Sounds fun, but one run only lasts about 60 seconds. And in normal goat form, you can't really do much other than basic flips and/or crashing into a ton of stuff. The second mini-mission (really more of a minigame) is Flappy Goat, or as I like to call it, proof that the developers hate you. I swear, Flappy Goat was designed just to cause pain to completionists everywhere. It's just so horribly done, the hitbox on the goat is downright terrible, and the gravity is just too harsh. Pair those 2 problems up with Flappy Bird gameplay and you've got yourself a headache. The worst part is, the developers added an achievement where you have to get 10 points on Flappy Goat. It may not seem too hard, but I've spent 2 hours myself trying to get that achievement. I swear, if there was anything to make me absolutely HATE goat simulator, it was Flappy Goat.\n\nMoving on to the goat itself. The goat has some basic abilities. Left click is headbutt/kick (when moving backwards), E is lick, which attaches your tongue to whatever object you were looking at, and lets you drag it around. Q forces the goat to go into ragdoll mode. I absolutely love this feature, as playing around with ragdolls in games like Garry's Mod and GTA 4 was how I spent most of my time. And it's much better in this game. I absolutely love tossing myself at whatever and going ragdoll just to see what happens. But my absolute favorite function of the goats is the bleat button. You press 1, and the goat bleats. It's pretty cool. Press it a few more times, he bleats like a normal goat would. Now you're having fun acting like a real goat. Press the 1 button a few more times, and you start hearing some weird stuff. The goat starts emitting booming roars and human-like screams. Now, it's downright hilarious. You jump off a high place, press the 1 button, and you hear a human scream as your goat is plummeting down, and you can't control your laughter. It's a hilarious feature and I'm extremely glad that the developers added it in. It almost makes up for Flappy Goat.\n\nThen there's the goat modifiers. The goat modifiers either gives you a special item or a new look. These goat modifiers can be earned in several ways. A few of them can be earned by completing certain mini-missions, and some can be earned by finding a certain amount of trophies. I also believe a few are unlocked from the start. I won't spoil any of them, but a bunch of the modifiers are actually really fun to mess around with.\n\nAs I've said above, there's a lot of stuff to do. A handful of mini-missions, a few things that you could unlock, and a few things to blow up! But all of this stuff is crammed into a fairly small map. I hate to say it, but the map is actually really bad. It's big enough to fit all the features it wants, but it just feels too crammed together. In my opinion, I think they just used a tech demo map and passed it off as the official release map. Had they created a much bigger map, or even several maps, I wouldn't have a problem. But as it stands, the main map isn't anything special. Fortunately, the game also comes with workshop support, where you can download player-made goats, gamemodes, maps, ect., so the game does feel much more fleshed out than I previously thought. But, in my opinion, the workshop for a game like this is really both a good and bad thing. It's good that a game like this is given tools so that players that want to add more CAN add more. But at the same time, if you took out workshop support, the game would only probably have a total of 3-4 hours of playtime total before people get bored. I feel as though the developers only added workshop support for this game because they got lazy, effectively making the players develop the rest of their game for them. I can't say that that would be a fact, but it seems to make enough sense.\n\nBefore I wrap up the review, I wanted to point out one simple feature on this game that I absolutely loved. This game has a legitimate text-to-speech feature with no dumb filter (like Moonbase Alpha). It's hilarious having it act as a narrative as you go around smashing into things.\n\nOverall, the whole game is pretty fun. I've already played it for several hours (upon posting this, which is written a day after the release). You can easily get hooked on this game because of the stupid physics alone. Just spending time on the water slides/trampolines is enough for a solid hour of fun. If you want a neat little time waster, I would definitely recommend this game. The price for this toy feels right as well, being at $10. I would definitely say at that price it's well worth it.","April 2, 2014","true","33.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

Some of the silly ones were good, even Surgeon Simulator was good, because it was silly and funny, but it was also actually slightly difficult, and was actaully a game. This game is not really that difficult, but it does have some good and bad traits to it. You can play as an animal, which is awesome! There are a lot of hard achievements to get (as well as some very easy ones), and it's a stupid simulator game.\n\nYou can play as an animal in this game, which I love. It's so hard to find games in which you can play as an animal, and that is the reason I bought this game in the first place, and in the terms of playing as an animal it really fufills it's goal. Not only can you play as a goat, but you can also play as a dinosaur, a penguin, a giraffe and a whale. As whatever you play, you can make noises and act as an animal destroying things.\n\nThe achievements can be quite difficult or quite easy, the early achievements are obviously very easy, but as in any game, they get harder.Checking the achievement stats, you can see that a lot of people haven't gotten qutie a few easy achievements, which makes it clear the people who play this game don't play it for the achievements. The big problem with the achievements are that you cannot get all of them unless you buy the other DLC for this game, such as the 'GoatZ' one, or the 'Payday 2' one. When there was just one DLC it was fine, but now they have released a lot more stupid DLC that has made it harder and harder to get more of the achievements. Having all the achievements to collect makes it more and more fun to replay the game and try and get the achievements.\n\nThis is obviously a stupid simulator game, but you don't always need to play it as one. No matter what the game, you are always the one who chooses to play the game a certain way, no one is forcing you to play this game in a stupid way, and headbutt things, and go all ragdoll everywhere. You are playing the game like that, and there's nothing wrong with playing the game like that, as it is a sandbox game. But there's also nothing wrong with trying to get all the achievements, it's just another way to play. But despite all that, it is a stupid simulator game, and that also means it has  a lot of spontanious references to mainstream things, like Minecraft, The Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy, and deadmau5. These references are at first slightly funny, as it's a reference that you know and it's in a game. But at the same time it's about as funny as Saints Row 3 or 4, it's the type of funny that is splewn across the later Saints Rows games, it's not as funny as it would have been if it was a more serious game, but with the references still in there. Having a more serious game with small funny things works more than a funny game with funny things.\n\nIn the end, I can't recommend this game, as this game only draws in people who just want to experience something spontanious, and not by people who want achievements (because of the low stats) and most likely not by people who like playing animals in games (as there isn't as much of a demand for those games). If you want to play a simulator game for the silliness of the game, you could play Surgeon Simulator, as it is a much more fun game, a game with references and still a lot more difficult to play than Goat Simulator. Although this game can be quite fun to play multiplayer, so unless you want to paly an animal, collect achievements or play multiplayer, then you should not buy this game, as it gets old quickley.","February 26","false","20.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You get the feeling that you cannot be a normal human being. You are being reminded by this depressing fact in every possible way:\n\n- You see robots\n\n- When you want to attend a family dinner, you cannot do anything but destroy it.\n\n- When playing the popular video game "Flappy Bird" you, and only you, are a goat in the game.\n\nOther people in the city will not react to your cries for help, they will only run away from you. You are searching for attention but everyone will ignore you.\nAnother sad fact is that you will encounter one scene in the game where people actually pay attention to you, but they just want to see you fight against other goats.\n\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is very depressing.\nSeeing how the town is slowly being destroyed by protesters, that don't want "♥♥♥♥♥ shaped food" nearly made me shed a tear.\n\nThis criticism makes the game something speacial, I would even say it will get the "GO(A)TY 2014" award.\n\n\nCoffee Stain studios have done a really good job by implementing a workshop feature, that allows players to create other maps, goats and other things.\n\n\n=> I highly recommend this game because of its' unique experience. However it is quite expensive and not really worth 10€.\n5€ would be more matching with the cost-benefit ratio.","April 5, 2014","true","1.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","2"

The game prides itself on being a 'Simulator', yet the realistic experience of playing a goat that was advertised is not delivered upon. For example-\n\n1) Goat's tounges are NOT adhesive, and they do not have the strength to pull along cars or people, as this game suggests.\n\n2) There is no Goat devil or angel - goats do not have a religion.\n\n3) The goat in this game can survive falls from extreme heights, explosions, being hit by cars, and being sucked into fans. Goats in real life are NOT immortal.\n\n4) Goats cannot perform front OR backflips, nor can they 'manual' on their front paws.\n\n5) In reality, Goats are NOT able to ride on Bikes or skateboards. Goats have a poor sense of balance, due to a natural inner-ear problem evident in their species  - this is perhaps the one thing this game portrays accurately.\n\nOverall, this game was extremely dissapointing. I expected another game for me to spend hours in, simulating my dream of being a goat and mating with female goats, or milking myself, yet in the end I found this game lacking of everything that I expected.","July 4, 2014","false","2.5"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cantavanda/recommended/265930/","cantavanda","❋ Cantavanda ❋","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cantavanda/","200 products in account","This game sucks.\nYes yes, it's an april fools joke, I understand, I have some humour. But ten euros for this disaster is just overpriced and it's one of the top selling games already for a week just because youtubers play it.\nSo, there are multiple factors that make this game an abomination.\n\nThe bugs, this game is one of the buggiest games I've ever seen, when you start to play it it is so funny HAHA THAT GOAT DOES FUNNY HAHA, but after a half hour all the jokes in this game become very repetitive and plain annoying. You can't walk without tripping over anything and then you have to wait until your goat stands up again, and three seconds later he's on the ground again. Also, when you're trying to do something it happens sometimes that you fly all over to the other side of the map because of a random programmed bug. And other situations are that you're trying to get on a roof for a trophy for the achievements, but you keep falling through the roof and then you have to climb up all your way back. And don't get me started on the bug that some 3d models like cars or trampolines don't appear until you're close to them.\n\nThe controls, the controls are so annoying, your goat goes most of the time for no reason in "muscles off" mode, and sometimes it takes time to undo that, guess why, because the controls aren't responding. The game is set for a QWERTY keyboard, mine is AZERTY, in almost all games you can edit the controls, and in all of those they stay saved, but of course, in this one, the controls don't save, you have to redo the controls all the time again and again and it gets annoying quick, and because that you get stuck a lot, you have to reset the game again and again and that obviously correlates with resetting the controls. There are also some control bugs, like when you start a new game the controls are not responding, etc.... And the worst thing is the acceleration of your goat. Since you fall so much, you have to accelerate again, and it goes from very slow to fast that you can't control your goat, and when you stop your goat while running he might fall over.\n\nThe achievements, most are very easy to get, it's fun getting a lot of achievements quick and seeing funny things, but then there are the unfair ones. And I mean unfair, not challenging. For example, the achievements of Payday 2 are insanely hard, but fair, the achievements of Angry Video Game Nerd adventures are hard, it's a hard platformer, but still, fair. But the achievements are this just ♥♥♥♥ you off so much. Let's take the all trophies one, some trophies are very easy to get, but others are on impossible locations with such big bugs that they're impossible to get that it takes you so many tries. Like the one under the fan, there is a spinning fan on a hard to reach location, and behind that fan theres a trophy, and the fan spins fast, and if you touch it you get rocketed to the other side of the map, that means you have to walk so much and fall over a lot again, reach that hard to reach location, and then try again. And since the controls are so annoying it's almost impossible to go over the fan, it took me so long and it was so annoying, but that's only one of the multiple hard to reach and unfair trophies. The jump on the five trampolines in one jump trophy is so annoying too because you can't see the trampolines until you are close to them because of bugs. So you have to search all the map for trampolines and perfectly remember their placement and then jump the very buggy jump controls which takes ages. And then there's the worst... the horrible... flappy goat achievement.... It's like flappy bird, but on a very small screen, full of bugs and much faster. So you go in a building and there's a tv there and on it flappy goat. The screen of that tv is small so you have to look very good, and it goes fast and you flap high. Also, the worst about it is the horrible collision, your goat touches the pipes even when it's not touching it, you really have to be far away from the pipes to not touch them, this took me a hour of pure frustration to do.\n\nWell, that's about it, this game is overrated, a disaster, overpriced and annoying. 1/10 just because it made me laugh in the first half hour","April 10, 2014","false","25.4"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","17","30","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PxH24/recommended/265930/","PxH24","๖ۣۜ⎛๖ۣۜZᴀᴅ⎞ۣۜ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PxH24/","45 products in account","PROS: A smallish map with a LOT to explore and the goals make the game more than just a mess-around game (although it really is that in the first place) and the fact that it is supposed to be buggy makes the game that much more hilarious. With the golden goat trophies this game makes my day. You can become [SPOILER ALERT]  a flipping sperm whale and flop around the map or even an alien from Sanctum 2 (it kinda looks like a bug giraffe thing) . There are many other goats you can be if you collect enough golden goat statues. This game even has workshop support, so if you get bored of the normal goats or the original map or even just want more abilities for custom games, then you can get an item from the workshop or make your own. For such a small map, the place is flipping packed with easter eggs (such as the golden goat trophies) and, my favorite, a cool robot dude in a storage crate held up by the crane and [SPOILER ALERT]  If you get certain achievments you can actually be the robot!  And on the side, there are many references to other games like Coffee Stain Studio's game Sanctum 2 and Flappy bird.\n\nCONS: The fact that they are only removing bugs that crash the game means that there will always be bugs. Always. Sometimes I find myself getting stuck on a rock and glitching underground. I still would like the bugs there but some of them are just plain irritating. The game also requires a pretty good graphics card, so make sure your computer isn't a potato and the game doesn't eat your computer. I had to turn my settings all the way down and only then did most of the lag go away. Another thing is that the Flappy Bird game (Flappy Goat) is the most rage inducing thing in the ENTIRE game. To unlock the achievment for the Flappy Goat you needed to score ten and my high score is like six. And the reason it is hard is because the hitbox of the goat is bigger than the goat itself so you end up hitting something when it looks like you didn't. And with some of the goats like the space goat for example, its a lot harder to know where your headbutting because you dont hit where your head goes, you hit right in front of you so it kinda seems a bit akward, but hopefully they will fix it. The game is still in development so all the bad stuff right now will probably be fixed in the future and new stuff will be added.\n\n\nOverall I give this game a 11/10. Apart from the bugs which they are never going to fix (which isn't really that bad) and some akward hitboxes this game is virtual gold. Mostly because the bad and irritating things about this game don't bother me as much as it would with other people. If you are looking for a good laugh, a goat with jelly legs, and a cool game to play with your friends at home  (They are planning to add local co-op)   then this is the game for you!*\n\n\n*This game is Chuck Norris approved","April 14, 2014","true","19.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I managed to play this goat specticle on a friends account .\n\nUpon seeing this game I thouht to myself how sad , but to be honest a part of my life is now complete , not only can I be a goat, I can be a super goat. I have the most powerful headbut the world has ever seen, as well performing amazing aerobatics ., while doing these wonderful feats of strength and grace , my tounge is hanging out like when you see a stunning woman walk past. you can lick the surroundings clean, another interesting thing about this game is the way you climb ladders , you literatly bite the ladder step , hopefully not catching your Goat licker 3000 inbetween your teeth and the ladder rung.  One of the best parts of the game is baa ing , not only can you install fear into all humans, goats and petrol tankers and stations , you can attract them with you very subtle Baa , which actually sounds like a little lamb.\n\nOver all a day in the life of a goat is not complete , I wish the developers would have put the option to eat and poop , just to make the exeprience complete.\n\nAll I can say is if you want to be a goat and can't get to a farm, a onsie or a  costume this is the next bext thing.

Through this groundbreaking simulation we are transformed; able to repercieve and refine our own lives through the experience of partaking of the essence of another lifeform. Some may see only a goat, but we become more. We surpass the mundane. We become the goat elivened with dreams, fantasies, and aspirations. Through the goat we become free to live out any and all freedoms this sumulated life grants us, free from disarming and constricting social bonds. As I partake of the simulation, I find myself overcome by the enlightenment granted by multiple and sometimes conflicting perceptions of the self. I am reminded that consciousness as we know it is infused throughout reality. I am redeemed. I am reborn.

It’s small, deliberately unpolished and buggy, and its design is simple. So it’s a good thing it’s a really funny joke, full of great physics-powered slapstick humor, and unexpected surprises in every corner of its seemingly peaceful small-town map. There’s not much actual gameplay here beyond breaking things for points, but shooting for a high score is probably the least entertaining thing about Goat Simulator. It’s mostly about exploring the fun house and discovering the hilarious surprises at your own pace.","June 27, 2014","true","6.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In terms of content volume, stability, polish, structure, and consistency, on those very descriptors alone, no.\n\nHowever, this game basically tells us here in 2014 that, in the end, we just want to have fun. This game is fun. For how long it's fun is up to you. Even so, there is a definite primal reaction this game elicits that will tell all but the most jaded, or those who seriously crave structure, that yes, you are having fun. You are enjoying this nonsense. It wants nothing more than for you to just go forth and have fun discovering weird things and wreak havoc in ways where you may not always be in precise control, but you are probably enjoying it just for what silliness goes on by your hand (or tongue).\n\nIt's a novelty, but it is also a powerful statement for the curiosity it is. There's a reason people wanted to play this, and it wasn't brand name, or celebrity voice actors, or any sort of technological prowess to show off the day's advanced hardware. It was because it looked fun, and I believe their expectations - and mine - have been met.

There is also many mods you can download to enhance your gameplay. There are also many screen anhancements and different control options. being a fan of these types of games i recommend this game to my fellow gamers.","March 31, 2014","true","7.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, Goat Simulator is, though full of issues, a very entertaining game because of its crazy antics and intentional, humorous usage of these issues. Obviously, the game was "Made to be broken", as some would say, but that does not make it as enraging as many games like it, as its entire premise is based around these glitches. Despite these, the gameplay is entertaining, and somehow manages to keep me from falling into boredom. I highly recommend it for anyone in need of a boredom-buster game.","December 19, 2014","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
