Expect to die many times, the game is challenging and I like it this way. Expect to read too, and I mean read a lot. Geneforge is a well-written story heavy RPG where your choices will matter, with diplomatic situations filled with gray areas (it's not at all your classic good vs evil scenario), tactical turn-based combat, several different ways to play the game (I choosed a solo Agent, but you might as well play a Shaper with an army of creations), I think there are 5 different ways to "win" the game and complete the story.\n\nI did not enjoy the story as much as the first game of this saga because the moral choices and the diplomacy were not as entertaining in my opinion, but they were far from being weak! Probably because of some similarities with Geneforge 1, it lacked the surprise and excitement to discover more about the whole plot. The first few maps were rather boring and linear, so it took me some time to get into the story. However areas turned out to be much more balanced than Geneforge 1 and the hand holding of the first maps didn't last long. At some point I became addicted and put some other games aside in order to see where the Geneforge 2 story was going to bring me.\n\nIf you are able to disregard the basic graphical quality when playing a game offering a rich world, deep story and a challenging yet enjoyable gameplay, the Geneforge saga and Spiderweb games in general are meant for you and will give you a great gaming experience, you should not hesitate to give them a try. Otherwise, I cannot recommend these games to you.\n\nMy rate: 8/10, I'm looking forward to play Geneforge 3 to 5.","April 2, 2014","true","109.0"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/recommended/200980/","wrath-","Wrath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/","145 products in account","A game along the lines of a Spiderweb title always contains a vast, vast, amount of content in terms of story, lore, conversation, etc. It's essentially like writing an entire interactive novel...three or four times, because there are always multiple endings based on your actions. Even if an action might have seemed insignificant at the time, you can bet you will feel it later on. Choosing from a handful of factions means choosing from a host of significantly different plot lines. Every named character you kill, you could have had a conversation and an alliance with.\n\nThis level of detail and development is pretty uncommon. You have to find titles like Bastion and Transistor in order to match the level of depth that comes from a game with the screenshots that make it look little more than an arcade game. Even then, the story is pretty linear. When we start up a Geneforge game, this diverse gameplay options inside a rich and immersive environment is what we are looking for. Fortunately, it's what we get; Geneforge 2 happens to be my favorite out of the series and one of the primary games that I grew up with. If Steam was able to record how much I played this game when it first came out, it would be over 500 hours. And since the story is just as good today as it was then, I see no reason why someone couldn't get half that time without even noticing.","November 5, 2014","true","3.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It remains possible for any class to purchase any skill but variable skill costs are in general dissuasive. Each of the three classes represents a different approach and contributes to the overall replay ability. There also appears to me at least one major choice (GF 1) via a factional alignment that is mediated by dialogue choices over time.\nThe slow-burn story and exploration of the culture of various factions within the game is also much as it was in Exile, as is fairly sizeable amount of gameplay and world. Geneforge has, however, created a rather distinctive setting surrounding an Academy of Biomages and their creations, sentient or otherwise, on an abandoned island you become stranded on. The difficulty curve is accommodating for those familiar RPGs, short of jumping straight to the hardest difficulty and/or punching through into distant territory. Fun, intricate and as charming as talking magical giant spiders.","December 27, 2011","true",""," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/valritz/recommended/200980/","valritz","[Val] Database Strugglebus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/valritz/","129 products in account","Geneforge 2 is more of the same from Spiderweb (almost literally, since it uses the same engine from Geneforge 1). The story is just as excellent, and your ability to interact with it and pick any road you choose is unchanged. One big thing to remember if you're starting Gen2 after Gen1: none of the endings are canon. Strictly. There's one ending to Geneforge One that's roughly canon, but even then, there are some differences that do make it its own thing. This is a trend for the series as a whole, actually, with the story progressing, but never quite as you thought it would.\n\nAnyway, TL;DR: Play it. It's great. Spend all your ability points in Parry. Be a god.","June 30, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I like the story and the way the setting works in this one, and they've cut down slightly (though only slightly) on turrets and mines.  There are some good horrific abuses of power in this one, to the point where I actually killed off a non-hostile NPC just to make him stop making sentient explosives.  There are five-ish factions this time; the Awakened, the Takers, two new Shaper-led factions, and the unspoken option to remain loyal to your masters and just kill everybody.  I like the mentor figure Shanti, and how her story and the investigations structure the game.\n\nReasonably solid sequel, that builds on where the last one left off.  My only frustration is the locked door in the northwest corner of the northwest everything that I could not open.  Can it be opened?\n\nFirst time players, I highly suggest NOT choosing any faction until you have been to every nonhostile city in the game.","September 5, 2015","true","36.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mystery and unique world caught my eight year old self off guard. I wasn't sure what I expected but it sure wasn't this. I absolutely loved it, though. The intrigue and politics flew right over my head. All I knew was that I had to find Barzahl. Now that I understood the true magitude of the complex plotline, I really started to enjoy the game. When I first discovered the depressing fate of my poor mentor, I was crushed. I despised Barzahl for what he had done to me and wished for revenge. Unfortunately, I think I died. A lot. Then again, everyone dies in Geneforge. Overall, it's a great game. Get it, please. You won't regret it, hopefully.","April 28","true","35.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
