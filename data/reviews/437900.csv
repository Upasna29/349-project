It is too bad that nowdays you can't buy one legally, because most Steam user doesn't have friends)\n\nGraphic:\nPixel Art graphic with high-polished pixelated pigs and ducks.\n\nGameplay:\nYou can control a pet, shoot your enemies, jump, collect coins... all with only one button.\n\nStoryline:\nYou are a little pig named "Bacon". Evil developer named Fabian Viking trapped you in a cage with a duck, a sheep and a flying fish. He forces you all to battle to death and only one of you who kill others will be released and free. But, the evil psychopath Fabian also put obstacles that can kill you once you make a collosion with them. Also, he is helping some of the pets by giving them laser guns and koppa troppa shells from Mario Cart.","March 6","true","1.1"," 56 of 60 people (93%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","93","56","60","51","1"

Touch the floor, walls, or ceiling- or get bopped on the head by another player -- and you lose a heart. Lose all your hearts and you're out. We tested it with up to 7 players and it gets very, very hard the more players you add. Well, not exactly hard- just freakin insane.\n\nSimple manic fun, and for free. There's some DLC but it seems reasonably priced (I guess) and I don't really think it's necessary to have some fun with this. This isn't the greatest game, but don't write it off as a generic Flappy Bird clone.","March 2","true","0.4"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","82","37","45","23","0"

Sounds simple? Well, did I mention that you also have to avoid spike traps, other players, along with the dreaded borders of doom?\n\nIt gets more hectic with the more players you have, which is a good thing, especially when you have friends over for a bout. Even if you are the type that’s forever alone, you can have an awesome battle between your left hand and right hand, in which my right hand always win.\n\nSlight warning though if you’re planning on using a single keyboard. Unless you have a mechanical keyboard with some specialised drivers, it is not likely to register more than four key presses at the same time. So I would recommend a controller or two on the side to even out the players on each input device.\n\nThe DLC packs are not required in any way, but they do add more characters and hats, it won’t hurt to buy some if you happen to like the game and support the developer.","April 7","true","2.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

I feel like this game has plenty of potential. For starters, if you could add online multiplayer with friends, this would make the game better, if you do have it then I havent see it, and also the graphics could use some tuning to them a little bit. Add some more power ups and skins to put some more variety, you know? Overall this game is doing good. I would recommend this to plenty of people.
