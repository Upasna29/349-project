You can try to escape but even if it works the monster will still be near you once out of combat and probably attack you again right away\n\n-the issues with combat means that if you build your character for, say, investigation or occult lore you'll be screwed since you'll be useless in combat and won't have npcs to back you up for quite a bit: the one npc I've met was also a pushover and could only withstand two hits. You'll have to try and come up with a cookie cutter combat oriented build if you want a chance in fights, especially with bosses , and this means you won't be really free to create a character as you see fit: also if you screw up your build I doubt you'll manage to advance much and might need to start over\n\nI went into Mythos expecting a good mix of combat and investigation but was sadly quickly disappointed when I realized that, despite investing equally in combat and non-combat skills, it still seemed it wasn't enough and that I'd have to just try over and over again to win a fight with wandering monsters. I do not find this enjoyable and the fact you can only save in certain rooms, thus having to walk back to where you were each time, just made things boring and frustrating.\n\nApart from combat the game suffers from very poor production values, the graphics are dark, lack detail and are quite low res, the sounds and music are basic and the voice acting is so bad that it ruins the otherwise interesting dialogues.\n\nIf you are ok with extremely hard games and don't mind being shoehorned into combat builds then you might find it decent but I honestly can't recommend it after my experience.","July 26, 2015","false","1.4"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","37","38","0","3"

You can easily tell that the original Resident Evil was a big inspiration (typewriter intro, dialogue, certain traps, jumpscares, saverooms, music) but turning that into a very limited turn-based RPG with a thick layer of lovecraftian horror added did not exactly produce a masterpiece.\n\nThe storyline and characters feel like someone checked off a list of popular elements found in the works of Lovecraft and other authors contributing to the "Mythos" of the Great Old Ones  (Paranormal investigator: check! Insane asylum: check! Cultists: check! Cross-dimensional incursions by unspeakable horrors: check!). However the horror is quite different in the way it is transported compared to your typical horror short story by the master, it lacks all subtleties and gets to the point really fast - quite schlock-y, really. About the only good point to this is that you get to fight a ton of bizarre creatures that perfectly fit my idea of cosmic horrors.\n\nApart from that, gameplay is dull, mostly consisting of getting keys/items that act like keys to unlock doors to repeat looking for keys or key-like items. There are a few logic-puzzles here and there that can be solved by reading the various manuals, diaries and notes (which again feel more like a reference to the way that Resident Evil did it, rather than putting a different spin on things) - but mostly you are going back and forth between places opening doors. I might also add that the game has a tendency to be really quirky about which direction actually allows to pick items up - and more often than not you cannot even tell what tile holds an important item. It is a throwback to the nasty days of pixelhunting with me being stuck looking for that one shelf that contains the next key-item to proceed.\n\nEvery now and then you get to use one of your skills, like Occult Lore, allowing you to read eldritch texts and translate ancient manuscripts - allowing the banishment of boss-monsters or getting extra-items. It is a cool little mechanic (very pen & paper-like) that just didn't get the attention and polish to truly shine - though this could become a real kicker in upcoming episodes if results were more meaningful / had more impact on the overall experience.\n\nTalking about experience, experience buys you upgrades, but also allows you to rest at savepoints or to buy items - making it the most valuable ressource. Especially since there is only a limited amount of encounters in the game, and difficulty is high (with powergaming opportunities to cheese it). It is also quite unforgiving and might kill you off in the second fight if you are not careful. But compared to modern RPGs, the slow paced, simplistic  turnbased combat of Mythos (most RPG Maker games, really) isn't all that exciting to be honest, especially since it is almost completely static if it weren't for the attack effects. Unfortunately this applies to pretty much all areas of the game, the tilesets are practical at best - but the game is almost entirely devoid of any animation. The walk-"animation" for the characters is downright pitiful  and gets a special place in "2-frame hell". Unfortunately, since there is so little distraction going on - you notice some glitches with the tileset-layering much more than you would otherwise.\n\nUltimately, Mythos feels like fan fiction that doesn't expand on the source material it is based on - instead it is trying to be cute with references to cover up it's lack of own identity. It is also questionable if the turnbased battles really add anything to what Mythos is about, perhaps toning down the battles to really rare encounters and rewarding players more for actions using their character-skills could make potential sequels interesting rpg/adventure-hybrids. For the time being I don't really feel like Mythos has anything to offer for people other than the most die-hard fans of lovecraftian horror or RPG Maker enthusiasts - there is potential here, but as it is Mythos feels more like a prototype or a proof of concept, with too strong "fan-fic"-vibes to really recommend it.","November 21, 2014","false","4.8"," 55 of 73 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","55","73","3","6"

Consider I roam around constantly to look for more enemy in order to gain EXP, it still take me quite a short time to finish it.\n\nAfter I'm roaming around, I found that the amount of enemy is pretty much fixed. No random encounter (as opposed to traditional RPG games), which is actually making me quite sad. I do hope that I can slaughter more enemy on my way.\n\nAs such, the warning at the beginning of the game that said: There is a limited number of EXP, is true. The most negative part here is that this could mean you will stuck within a certain area forever, because you don't have enough EXP to perform certain thing (potentially spoiler hence skipping this).\n\nThe other thing I noticed is that the EXP you will earn from killing enemies is also fixed, no matter how many enemies you encountered in a battle. This is not totally something bad but just feel unbalanced.\n\nOh, and the puzzle solving is actually a bit too easy, especially seem like all related document can be found in the same room.\n\nNow on the positive side, this is quite a different combination of gaming experience. Mixing horror and RPG together may sound weird, but it work (at least for me).\n\nWill actually recommend this game. Just hope that it will be longer in the sequel.","October 28, 2014","true","6.1"," 61 of 83 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","61","83","0","0"

The gameplay is standard tuned based RPG goodness; you can attack with psychic powers, physical attacks, guard, heal or use buffing powers.  There are several statistical categories that govern how powerful your characters are and also many skills to purchase, all of this is done with experience points you either earn in battle and also by trading in unwanted items.  The character building is quite deep, allows for some different playstyles, and absolutely necessary to master and maintain as this is not an easy game, even on casual difficulty.  Took me 6 in game hours to complete my play thru on casual difficulty, but 10 real world hours due to dying without getting to the next save room, and I have beaten many and old school RPG in my time and am no novice to this style of game.\n\nThe story itself is suitably creepy and mysterious, the writing is decent, the voice acting is poor but for a small project like this I was great full to have any voice acting at all.  The music adds to the atmosphere and never gets tiring.  The asylum you explore is filled with puzzles, monsters and mysteries to solve, and how you choose to do so is up to you.  Suck at the puzzles, spend some experience points on your intelligence levels and you can bypass them.  Want to unlock that door or decipher that secret evil looking book, purchase the appropriate skill powerups.  You have to pick and choose as XP points are limited, making Mythos a fun, deep and challenging adventure fit for any RPG gamer that likes lovecraftian horror and old school charm.   First part of a planned series, but Mythos: the beginning stands on its own two feet as a complete story, and plays great with a gamepad.\n","December 21, 2014","true","10.1"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

The difficulty of Mythos for every playing style is equal. Whether you are fighting every enemy or avoiding every enemy, this shows how Dark Gaia really thought about the execution of this game.\n\nMythos the beginning also has many puzzles in which some require a keen eye to detect and good logic reasoning.

I don't know, because the controls and lack of save points prevented me from actually progressing in the game at all.\n\nCONS:\nThe graphics are extremely rough (spites, text, AND animation).\nThe voice acting suffers from both poor audio quality and poor acting talent.\nThe controls are somehow oversensitive (selection) and undersensitive (movement) at the same time, and are non-customizable.\nThe item system uses up items if you cancel partway through.\nObject interaction only works when standing in VERY specific spots, with no indicator of where you're supposed to stand to interact with any given object.

Allow me to explain why.\n\nMythos is a survival horror rpg with heavy-handed Lovecraftian elements. It's a very short game (clocking in at about three hours, playing as a completionist, on the hardest difficulty) so long as you don't get stuck, but it's also got puzzles and lacks a walkthrough, so your mileage may vary.\n\nIn Mythos, you investigate a semi-condemned asylum/hospital/thing, skulking around in the dark and occasionally falling through the floor to your death. The game is class-based, and it lets you freely spend exp in safe rooms to progress your character's combat abilities and investigative chops. Raise your int stat high enough (60) and you can bypass every puzzle in the game. Raise your sense stat high enough, and hidden items start appearing on the floor around you. Stats are reasonably well balanced, and most character builds are viable. So long as you build high int and throw spells, or build high attack and hit rate. Some combats can be optionally sidestepped, but a lot of monsters on the map clip towards you at just barely sub-sonic speeds, making evasion unlikely. Monsters and investigation points are also your primary source of exp, so I found myself combing the asylum for every squamous horror I could locate in order to make my intestines stronger. Optionally, you can also spend items for exp, which was kind of a neat feature. I mulched my entire inventory into my statline and promptly discovered I did not need to be healed when my defense was so high that I could not be hurt.\n\nWhich brings me to game balance. Mythos is a little wonky in this regards. Played properly, it probably is a nail-biting exercise in inventory management. However, exp costs for stats progress based on how many save rooms you have discovered, not on how many points you have spent, so I just scooped every single point I could find in the first few areas  and made myself indestructible before even seeing a boss. If I hadn't decided to spend points to pad the survivability of my companions, I would have breezed through the final act of the game too.\n\nRegarding raising any of the stats on your companions: don't. Them dying in combat has no actual repercussions whatsoever, so just use them as one-hit distractions for the monsters. Get your luck and guts high enough, and status effects and damage will not touch you.\n\nMythos' design also falters when it comes to its graphics and voice acting. The rest of the sound design on the game is utterly lovely, and evokes just the right atmosphere, but I've never seen worse (and buggier) voice-work. Everyone you meet sounds like they're trying to force a British accent through a sieve of rusting fish-hooks and razors, and that in turn is wrapped in some kind of low-fidelity distortion that made me take off my headphones every time someone spoke. I believe you can turn voiced dialog off, but you have to go into a menu in the game. Which means the intro voiceing is probably unskippable.\n\nGraphics are not much better. This is an RPGmaker title. It shows. On top of that, all the character portraits and monsters look like they were whipped up using some sort of 1991 home edition 3D modeling software. It's garish at best, and comical at worst.\n\nSo, what's good about this game? Why did I eventually switch back to a 'yes' rating?\n\nUnfortunately, it's fun.\n\nI genuinely enjoyed most of my three hours playing it, and I even managed to get kind of immersed in the story and ambiance a few times. Mythos does not outstay its welcome (I'd say it understays it), and I found myself thinking about it after it was over - and not just in a "what did I put in my brain?" kind of way.\n\nI don't think this was because of the writing, which was bog-standard Lovecraftiana. I don't think it was strictly the gameplay either. But somehow the whole of Mythos is greater than the sum of its jumbled-together parts. Dollar-for-dollar, I wouldn't take it over Alien or Amnesia, but if you want to support a pretty cool indie dev or slum it with a project-on-a-budget, you could do worse than this.","June 20, 2015","true","4.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

You create your own character, so your character isn't voiced, and the story is mostly fixed, although you can effect parts of it.  You have enough control to feel that you are in control of the game.  The story is mostly good but it's based off a perversion of the bible....sorta.  It is based around the lore of the bible but twisted to fit their vision of the scope of the story, but it doesn't play as big of a role as you might think.  This honestly feels like a resident evil rpg style game except you don't have to worry about ammo, and you can save the game in save rooms (reminding me of the type writers) but you can save in those rooms any time and as many times as you like.\n\nYou do get a limited amount of save items to save anywhere, but there are no random battles. It's chrono trigger style battles, you see enemies on the map, and make contact with them to start battle.  Battles are quick, defending is a big broken though.  When you defend, you get a percentage of health and sp back, which is nice, but it seems like if the enemy goes before your action, you don't get reduced damage.  I need to test this a bit more, and there are a few small bugs here and there, such as a few places refering to my female created character being refered to as a male, and a few text bugs, but nothing major.\n\nThis is actually a fun game, once I started it, I kept playing, and there are moments in the game that are quite scary.  You can pick most locks instead of having to find a key, but a small issue with this is that when you do find the key, it serves no purpose, and the key items can get a bit cluttered.  The regular items though can be traded in at the save rooms for experience to level up which is actually quite nice, as the healing items were common but i rarely had any as they were more useful as exp instead of using them to heal.  This gave the game a great balance, but it might be possible to get to a no win situation, but so long as you save an item or two, or put the game in easy mode, this can be avoided.  My only issue with the diffculty though was that it only effected leveling up, you always got the same amount of xp from battles, the difficulty seemed constant regardless of difficulty.\n\nI enjoyed this game and the ending wasn't bad but i got a D ranking at the end so i will play this again and see what i get when i get higher ratings.  Not sure how that will effect the game and what it's based on, and i haven't figured out what some items do, so it's worth a replay.\n\nOne other issue I found was though was that all bosses in the game can be beaten by exploration and finding items that insta kill the enemies.  I used persuade to prevent one boss, and the final boss i didn't fight because i found items that killed him.  The reward for xp is the same if you fight him or find the items, and I found that to be disappointing.  I felt like you should get bonus xp for actually fighting, as that was much harder then just quickly finding the item.\n\nOver all, this is a cheap game and I got nearly 8 hours out of it on my first playthrough.  The graphics remind me of phantasy star but the atmosphere was excellent.  There is a part where you explore the catacombs and wondering the map, you hear grunts and groans and the occasional zombie crying out 'brainssssss.....'.  It got a good sense of dark humor.  Try it, if you like resident evil and rpgs, you'll enjoy this game.  It's not a killer ap, it's got a few scares, solid gameplay, an interesting story worth reading, and it's a solid and addictive 8 hours or so.\n\nIf you find out what the bonesaw does, please tell me :)","January 13, 2015","true","7.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Text doesn't fit inside the text border when in full screen so you have to guess what the missing words are. Voice acting is terrible. The very first scene has a guy who can't decide what accent he's going to use today.\nWhen interacting with something I'm greeted with a prompt window that has no text in it.\nWasn't expecting much since in came in a very cheap bundle but to charge money for this at all is nothing short of scandalous.","January 17, 2015","false","1.6"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I bought it because of the H.P. Lovecraft settings and it turns out it's a really good game. Yes, it can be kind of buggy at times, but all-in-all I find the storyline and gameplay very captivating. There really isn't enough Lovecraft-esque games out there. 7/10","January 19, 2015","true","9.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It has a certain charm to it, even if I do get stuck now and again.  I like the optional talents (for lockpicking, convincing people, investigating things), and the way that can unlock things.  The battle system is unremarkable and either difficult or effortless -- I'd recommend putting everything you've got into the Combat stat for a while, and trading most/all items for XP.\n\nIt was worth the dollar or two I put into it, though it may be a bit rough around the edges for some.  I'll be curious to see what else the developer puts out there.","May 30, 2015","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Aside from that this is a pretty cool game. Its short but mix's old style rpg with horror elements in an interesting way, nice atmosphere and different builds for your character to try too.","December 16, 2015","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A little rough around the edges, but I can forgive that. The part that bugs me is combat. The game hints that it's discouraged, but at the same time, it's mandatory in order to get experience to get further in the story. Not to mention, two of the background choices hardly survive their first real combat after the tutorial fight. I would suggest not making every single encounter with two creatures; they're tough enough on their own.","December 8, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

It's an extremely bad treatment of the genre, and it's an insult to fans everywhere.\n\nTechnical problems abound.  Mythos the Beginning plays a lot like a game from 1992.  When I first ran it, I thought I'd picked up some abandonware/retro game I hadn't previously heard about.  Unfortunately, after some research, the game really was published first in 2014.   It has pixel graphics and only supports 4:3 aspect ratio - you cannot change the resolution of the game, and the inputs are mostly controller based (despite the game having no console release!).   If the low effort technical implementation isn't enough to scare you away, the rest will.   You also need to enable your Windows Firewall to run this game, because bad game design is bad.\n\nGraphics are really bad - they're pixel level, clunky, and of course the 4:3 technical limitation just makes things worse.  Animations are almost comically bad - you have about 3 different frames for walking (left arm forward, arms middle, right arm forward), which just looks terrible.  Extremely low effort and clunky.\n\nGameplay is fairly pedestrian but they also make your life hard by adding unskippable slow dialogue and intro text.  Considering all the other problems you have to go through to get into the game, being presented with a very average adventure game just doesn't make all the hassle worth it.\n\nTo add insult to injury, they actually want you to pay them money for this poor experience.  Impossible to recommend.  I hope the developers get eaten by a Shoggoth.","May 24","false","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
