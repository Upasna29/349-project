I find the gameplay a bit slow overall, but it's a complex game with a lot going on each time you play.\n\nRight off the start this game grabbed me.  The intro music is catchy.  The sound design is great.  The graphics are good, for what they are and what the game is, but I really like the artistic style even though the graphics aren't what most people would call spectacular.  The gameplay can seem simple at first, but it's not.  Not at all.  It's got style.  It's got good gameplay with well thought out mechanics.  It's got Gremlins and Gadgets and Goodies and Gold.  The alliteration - that's all mine.  And so's the gold.\n\nFYI folks - though it may seem like it, this is *NOT* a collectable card game, every player draws from the same deck.  Everyone has the same options available to them, but it is a random draw.  You *ALWAYS* have 6 cards, even after you just played a card to move - you instantly draw back to 6.  Discard your whole hand?  Sure - but draw back up to 6 right away.  Does this affect your game?  Yeah, you may have been on the way to a place where you can play one of your cards, but because of the draw you don't need to go there anymore.  You may need to backtrack for several turns to get to another location where you can do something beneficial.  You may need to go somewhere closer for an even better card than you originally had.  You just don't know, but you always have options because you always have 6 cards.\n\nThe gameplay is rather deep and it takes a while to get used to it.  I've played a couple games vs the A.I. and haven't won yet, but I'm getting the hang of it.  It may take a couple more games before my plans actually start to pan out a bit better.\n\nYes, this is a board game and yes a 6 sided random number generator is used.  Usually, when you play a board game you roll dice to determine a andom distance your token or player or piece moves - then you have to deal with the outcome or consequences of the space where you landed or stopped.  Simple and straightforward.  This is the method used by a lot of the classic board games and there is often little to no thought or decision making involved once you land on a space.  Why did I just explain that?  You already know that, right?   Well, I explained it because Gremlins, Inc. is pretty much the opposite of that.  And that's a very, very good thing.\n\nIn this game you CHOOSE how far you're moving based on the six cards in your hand.  You can use any of them for movement, they all have a move value from 1 to 6, with 2-4 looking like they're the most common.  Instead of your movement being random and the outcome of the space you land on being fixed, the movement is chosen by you but the outcome of the spots or places you land on is frequently random, but not always.  And sometimes you can play a card or have a permanent effect that cancels or changes the outcome of the spaces where you land.  The board also has several options for where you can go and how you can get there, plus some cards bypass normal movement rules completely.  There's always choice involved in where you go and what you're trying to do instead of the game forcing you to go somewhere and often giving you no choice over what happens when you get there.  Basically - Gremlins, Inc. is the opposite of what I don't like about many traditional board games.  Sure, they can pass the time but are you really using your noggin to make decisions?  In Gremlins, Inc. you are using your noggin - or you're losing.  Big time.\n\nThere are a variety of ways to play.  I thought I had a recent game in the bag.  I had a huge income.  I got a lot of money when I passed an income square, double if I landed on it and double if I went to the bank, which usually yields zero, I was the governor so didn't have to worry about bribes/police and had a few other things going for me.  I had nearly enough of a score to win the game.  I was, however, nearly broke.  I should have had cash like crazy, but I had the least of all the players.  Still, I was in good shape, right?  I had some cards that were easy to play and would have given me the game.  Did I win?  Nope.  Some sneaky Gremlin managed to score just enough points to win before I could.  Did I pump my income just a bit too much when I should have been doing something else?  Should I have passed up the win on that last election to get some more money or move to a different location on the map?  Should I have stayed in jail instead of accepting amnesty a couple times to get out early?  No idea... but I made those decisions myself.  I didn't lose just because of a couple dice rolls.  Sure I had a few rolls go the wrong way but I chose to to to those places and those dice rolls were something I chose to let happen.  Basically I chose my fate, not the dice.  I could have avoided those places or spots but I decided to risk it out.\n\nI mentioned jail - you *CAN* go directly to jail in some cases, but you don't just sit there rolling dice or paying a fine to get out.  Things happen while you're in there that can change the outcome of the game - and sometimes it's actually in the jailbird's favour!\n\nIf you haven't figured it out yet, I think everyone should check this one out.  And by check it out I mean buy it and play it, or at the absolute least give it a very good look and read up on it, well beyond my review, because it's a pretty solid game and quite fun overall.\n\nAlthough I found the gameplay a bit slow this game deserves at least a solid 8/10. . . so I'm giving it a 9.  Why?  Because I actually liked it from the first moment the game was fully loaded up.  Usually I'm grumpy about something within seconds - whether it's poor music, a terrible tutorial or game manual, or just a craptastic user interface.  This game did all of that, and more, very well.  What do you do with people who do something well?  You give them a good frigging review, that's what.\n\nEdited - caveat emptor - the game needs access to the internet and is designed to be played online.  Sorry for not adding that in earlier.  Single player is possible with AI, but it's meant to be a multiplayer game.  There are several "ladders" for players of various skill and rank.","March 14","true","3.2"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","38","44","3","4"

The style and attention to detail on the cards is incredible, and the game board is beautiful, with little things lighting up and moving in the background, making the board feel 'alive.' There is a prototype card game being produced in limited run, and I'm buying it for the artwork of the cards alone.\n\nGameplay wise, I feel like it accomplishes a good balance of strategy and luck... enough to keep you on your toes and guessing from beginning to end. There is a good variety of types of card with various effects, good and bad, that can be played against others or played against you. I really enjoyed the dual role of cards (you use them to move, plus you need to strategically plan out where you will land on the board in order to play other cards for points).\n\nA single player game took me roughly an hour, and this was with me very casually reading every line of every card and getting up to make tea, etc... so really, you could probably move through a game in 30-45 minutes.\n\nI highly recommend this game to board game lovers, steampunk enthusiasts, and strategy/card game fans.\n\nI bought it for $9.99 in Early Access, and there is some discussion of raising the price by about 50% when it goes live... and I can tell you that this game is easily worth $14.99. So throw some money to an indie developer and pick this up.\n\nYou wont regret it!!","February 16","true","9.9"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","33","37","3","0"

Yea they have some items they want to finish before release, but this is mainly polishing and make sure that all screens are beautiful. What is important that game communicity is already enough to have constant gaming in EU and US timezones.\n\nPros:\n- Deep game mechanic, so there are space to get better and better in it\n- Very polished and nice looking game already (early access)\n- Big community in EU and US timezone - average wait time 5 min for ranked game, 15 min max. Lots of 3+ players games.\n- Funny and not repeatable at all due to massive random - each game has it's own fun.\n\nCons:\n- Game can last for as long as 2 hours and you have limited amount of time on turn, so you need to be able not be fully comitted for this period.\n\nP.s.

Get that into your head when you decide on buying this game.  Imagine sitting at a table with your friends choosing between this, Monopoly, and Risk.  Gremlins isn't like any other board game I've played, though, and it fits being a video game well.  Each player has six cards in hand, drawn from the same deck of cards, and when you play a card, you draw a new one.  Cards can be played to move across the board, or on certain spots on the board to accomplish certain things.\n\nEach spot on the board has a different event, and measuring where you want to land and mapping out paths to different locations is crucial.  There is a lot of dice rolling in this game, and oftentimes the rolls can give you massive bonuses or horrifying penalties.  The player to accrue the most "Points" by playing cards and activating effects wins the game after either reaching a set milestone, or having a certain number of turns pass.\n\nThere's a ton more to be said, but that's the basic gameplay.  It's simple.  It's like rolling the dice to move around the board in monopoly, and then deciding what to do with where you land.  Or moving troops around on a Risk board, carefully planning around your opponents.  It's simple to learn and yet has a surprising amount of strategy behind what you choose to do.  And sometimes the dice just don't go your way, but luck seems to favor superior tactics in the long run.\n\nIf you don't enjoy the casual tabletop experience, you might not enjoy this game.  If you have ever sat back and thought it would be great if you could have that in a game, this game is for you.  At $15, it's cheaper than most tabletop board games, and I enjoy it a great deal more.  I hope you at least give it a try.\n\nBottom Line: Recommend for the price","March 12","true","11.9"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","37","47","0","0"

The art and theming is fantastic. The cards are clever and interesting to play. There is some RNG, but when you fail it's way more hilarious than it is enraging. (Usually.)\nIt plays best with friends, but make sure you're good friends before you start to play. You WILL be actively dicking each other over at every turn. It works out, though--it's as entertaining to lose as it is to win! (THERE GOES HALF YOUR MONEY, ♥♥♥♥♥!)\n\nOne of my only problems with it is the game is balanced toward zero-income. By that, I mean that a lot of the cards will steadily drain your income over time unless you combat it, so the game doesn't regularly reach an endgame state where game-winning cards are easy to build. You have to nickel-and-dime (or should I say cog-and-gear?) your way to the top sometimes, and with the prevalence of cards and mechanics that can reduce your victory point total, it can be really rough to secure a point victory.\n\nAlso, while I enjoy playing this game single-player on occasion, I wouldn't call the current single-player mode great. The AI, in an attempt to be more difficult, will target you with every card it can, which normally results in it just sending you to jail and reducing your point total every chance it gets. Combine this with the fact that gameplay in singleplayer currently consists of you racing to win in a very short amount of time, and you don't have a great situation. Oh well. You don't lose the challenge for going overtime, and the challenges themselves offer new and interesting strategies to play the game by. It makes me excited for the upcoming update where they add character abilties (as free DLC!)\n\nAll in all, this is a fantastic digital board game. If you like this kind of game, definitely pick it up and swindle the gold right out of those poor sucker's--I mean, start a reputable business today!","May 17","true","34.4"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","21","21","2","0"

Or rather, digital adaptions of real board games are. There are a few that survive the translation well, (Blood Bowl which is on Steam as well, and Diplomacy¹ being the ones that comes to mind). However, an actual digital boardgame in the true sense, a boardgame created WITH digital in mind, is not so common. gremlins is one such game, and a fine example of it. Systems that wouldn't work so well on a physical boardgame are taken full advantage of here, such as 3 didgit resources (Which doens't seem a big deal, but try telling everyone to half their currency in a tabletop game, and watch as everyone has to fuss about with the Bank to get all their paper dollars in order), long term events. The game itself is of course great too, a game of deviousness, misfortune, and constant push and pull between players.\n\nThe main mechanic that exemplifies how the game takes a unique spin on things is movement. Every player has a hand of 6 cards that are replaced as they spend them. Cards have both an effect that can only be activated on certain types of spaces, and a picture of a dice. That picture is how many movement squares you can move, and thus every turn you must select a card because you either need to move a certain # of spaces, it's the one you'd least like to keep, one you activly want to discard, etc etc. Thus even the act of moving carries decisions and tradeoffs.\n\nThe developers also take full advantage of the digital nature of the game, such as making serverside updates without pushing a client side patch.\n\n\n¹ Diplomacy can be played at the website WebDiplomacy, PlayDiplomacy, or on Android client Droidippy","March 15","true","21.3"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

Are you cunning enough to bring misfortune to others? Are you ruthless and will do anything to win? If your answers to all these questions is yes, then…..Welcome to Gremlins City!\n\nGremlins Inc is a strategy/board game and guess what? Yes you are a cunning Gremlin with a golden tooth! You will have to make a name for yourself in Gremlins City. The city itself is the board and has 11 locations where you can score points, with the exception of the jail, where you will not get any points at all!\n\nAt the start of the game you will be presented with a hand of 6 cards; you can choose to change a couple of cards, all the cards, or just keep what you see.\n\nThere are 3 decks of cards. The first deck has 130 cards (check out the Gremlinopedia in the game for a full description). Each card has a number (a dice if you like, 1 to 6) on the top left corner which represents how many movements you can make with it. At the bottom, it will tell you in which location you can use that card and what you can get for it. It could be gears (points) - you need these to win the game; it could be votes - during the gameplay elections will pop up and if you have the most votes you might just become the new governor of the city and be exempt from a couple of things; it could be malice - you will need these points to access the inferno deck of cards. Make sure you have plenty of money, my dear Gremlin, because some cards will cost you to use, especially the ones that have a large number of gears (points). With the Inferno deck cards, you will need malice, vote points and plenty of money to be able to use them. There are only 6 cards per game with big points attached to them. Once they are used they are gone, so be sure to grab them first! Misfortune is your last deck of cards which consists of 30 cards.  Land on one of them and guess what will happen? MISFORTUNE! MARVELLOUS (NOT)!!\n\nSingle and multiplayer (with a leader board) modes are available to you and a comprehensive tutorial to tell you how the game works.\n\nThe 2D graphics are nice and the audio is smashing (nice Jazzy music)!\n\nGremlins, Inc is a very impressive early access game; fun, with plenty of humour, fairly addictive and with a great deal of re-playability.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Single and multiplayer modes\n-	Good content with good humour\n-	Fun and easy to play\n-	Nice 2D graphics\n-	Great music\n-	Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No trading cards\n\nFans of this genre of game will be delighted!

You're using cards to move and to do something. It's very fun to play with multiple people, because there always something happened.

Every card has a dice value and an action, some also have additional costs like votes or money. You can use the cards to either move (which can be done on used on any tile) or use it's action (actions can only be played on the tile listed on the card). If you use a card to move you CANNOT use it as an action as the card will have been used so choose carefully as some cards are worth saving. Some cards also have permanent abilities that remain active after you play the card such as gaining 50g after passing certain locations which can be very helpful in the long run. All players play from the same deck as opposed to creating your own deck which adds another element of randomness to the game.\n\nThe aim of the game is to win by either reaching the set score or having the highest score at the end of the time limit or set amount of rounds. You can increase your score by playing certain cards, going to certain locations on the board and random events. Since there are a few different ways to earn skill points there is a little more freedom in the way you decide to play unlike most board games.\nYou'll need to collect various resources as you make your way around the board and each resource will help you in it's own way. Gold is used to pay bribes, play certain cards and activate certain tiles or locations. Votes are used to win the election and become Governor (which has it's own rewards). Malice is gained by playing certain cards or doing some negative actions to the other players. The less malice you have, the better.\nUnlike most board games I find Gremlins INC very punishing but in a good way. The board is designed to make you actually think about which cards you want to play and which you want to save because one card can be the difference between a win and a loss. You can be thrown in jail one turn before you were about to play a winning card, or lose a chunk of your income from landing on a misfortune tile so having some type of strategy matters. This can, and will drive you crazy but it does make the game a lot more fun.\nThere are single player and multiplayer modes and even ranked for those of you who are a little more competitive. The single player includes a handful of missions to complete and will keep those of you who don't dive right into MP busy.\n\nThe graphics are wonderful though I was disappointed at the lack of animation. Despite the artwork looking really beautiful It would have been nice to have a little more going on than just words popping up and your avatar moving along. When I play an online board game I do expect it to look a little more exciting than if I physically bought one.\nI LOVE LOVE LOVE the music but once again I just feel like there isn't enough of it. Other than the intro screen music there is nothing more than a little haunting background sound as you play. Fortunately neither of these things detract from the fantasic gameplay.\n\nIf you love board games then you'll want to try Gremlins INC as soon as possible. It delivers something new and fun to a genre desperately in need of good games.  I can't wait for more of my friends to buy this so I can ruin some friendships.","March 18","true","8.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

This game may lead to breakups, divorce or the occasional car being set on fire.

All this confirmed in a steampunk style.\nThe gameplay is enough simple, at the start you have one character at the one point of board and 6 different card in a hand, all cards can be used to move (from 1 up to 6 step, depend of card) or specific actions what been available at some place of border and if you have some additional requiems to (for example money).

In both section you have very good set up settings for that how long should be a game or what should be a main target. In game can play in one time up to 6 player. Also the game have very good tutorial, if  you complete this, you learn all what should know to play.\nThe graphic style is very nice, completed in steampunk, also a game music is very enjoyable.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+great music\n+nice graphic\n+steam achievements and trading cards\n+multiplayer with leaderboards\n+good game settings\n+good tutorial\n+confirmed with humor\n+ challenging\n\n-sometimes some matches can be too long, its can be problem at multiplayer\n\nThis game is very good, especially if you like this genre of games, its can be instant buy for you.

The board as well as the cards really are amazingly well balanced and work in perfect concert with each other! Your initial impression when watching begginner let's plays might be that it involves a lot of luck, but once you understand how to manipulate the game board and your rivals to your advantage, it's much less about luck and much more about playing your hand in the optimal way. I've put in 20 hours already and I can still see plenty of ways to up my game. Each time I play I realize amazing new ways to combo my cards and each time it becomes more apparent, how well designed this game really is.\n\nThrowing other players under the bus and pulling off amazing card combos feels extremely rewarding and unless you hit a very unlucky streak, the downs in this game never seem that grim, especially because everyone is hit by them sooner or later.\n\nPlayers naturally ganging up on the leader(s) tends to keep the race tight and interesting until the very end in most games I played. Yesterday I've pulled off an amazing comeback, where I skyrocketed from 3 points to 20 in two turns and actually won, while the other three players had 15-18 points, undoubtedly discounting me entirely, whilst backstabbing each other. Such is the power of flying under the radar and picking the perfect moment to strike - the intense rush of pulling off such a close victory feels amazing.\n\nThis game is incredibly addicting, usually I don't play "board games" often (virtual or physical), but this one you won't put down anytime soon. very much worth the money and it seems to have good future prospects with many planned improvements to come.","March 17","true","45.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/recommended/369990/","morphicmetal","morphicmetal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/","3537 products in account","Gremlins Inc. is a crazy steampunk card game that has a focus on making money through movements on a gameboard.  You get six random cards, and you play against other people or AI and try to win by ending with the most score resource.\n\nYou can play by tweaking various amounts of score limits, or whoever is ahead at the end of a certain number of turns, for instance.  There are a lot of various rules that are included in the game, based on spaces you land on, and cards with varying effects, depending on what cards you end up playing, or getting as you go around board game style spaces.  You really have to watch what is going on, and employ your own strategies each round on which cards to keep, and which ones to use for movement, or to hold for later on in the game.  The cards you play have the movement amounts, as opposed to dice, but dice play a "roll" *cough cough* in certain events in the game as well.\n\n\nPros:\nI like the interesting variety of cards, and the effects they can have.\n\nThe concept and planning aspect behind the game is fun.  I think it's a good game for figuring out how you want to move, which cards you want to save, and how you want to go about the board moving.\n\nThere is a large amount of replayability to this if you are into board game genres.  It can be challenging going for trying to go for higher ranks versus AI, no doubt.  I suspect the same versus other players, if there is any multiplayer community at the current time.\n\nThere is an achievement system which can be nice to go along with my above point of replaying, if you are into that sort of thing.\n\nThe setting is interesting, to say the least.  I like the stylization of the characters, and the look of the game and its overall "feel".\n\nGameplay is very smooth, and seems well done for what currently is in the game.  I think there is a lot of potential to go further with what is already available!\n\nI thought it was fairly easy to understand how to play this one, as far as movement, what means what on screen UI layout, and the tutorials are pretty straight to the point, and were not too difficult to get acquainted with once I got started on my own.  Took me a little time, but once I figured it out, and went back over a thing or two in the tutorials, I was good to go.\n\n\nCons:\nI find it fairly difficult to get ahead quickly.  It usually takes me some time to build up resources, so winning in a specified number of turns seems very difficult, so while for some people the challenges might be fun to go for, I cannot see myself getting the highest rank on the challenges without some major luck, and even then I cannot comprehend the top tiers on each AI scenerio.\n\nI usually end up wasting a lot of potentially good cards, since the effects can only be used on specific spots.  While this is understandable, I still wish I had some kind of a reserve pile or something I could go back to later for some sort of cost or penalty if I chose to save a card for later.\n\nThe board stays the same, and I would enjoy seeing more variety with the layout, and maybe changes in paths, how you move around it, etc.  All the places are in the same spots, and you do the same things at the places, aside from the cards you actually can play at specific spots.\n\nThe price seems a bit high for the amount of content currently in the game.  While it is fun, I would want to see more in future updates, hopefully.\n\nThere is no demo to try a level and see how somebody likes it.  Most board games fans would probably enjoy this, but I do think for the price, a demo might be a good thing to be sure it's what one would be interested in.\n\n\nOther Thoughts:\nWell, after playing a few games on here, I've won against the AI a few times.  I would like to have more customization with how cards are acquired, and maybe some ways to change your deck, or make the decks of your opponents change to make them easier or tougher to win against.\n\nIt's easier for me to play a longer match and win that way, than playing one that is based on turns.  This game took me a few tries to start to understand exactly how everything worked, even though I did the tutorial.  It's not hard to pick up, but just a few things had me scratching my head at the very beginning.  Once I understood, no problem at all, but in my own case, I had to play and do it for myself a few times to sort of figure out which cards were good to hold onto, and when to use certain cards, or which were probably not reasonable to keep at the current time in the game for me.\n\nChoosing what to do, and when can sometimes be easy, and sometimes a difficult thing, since you have six spots where your cards are placed, and each turn usually will cause one card to be used, and replaced.  Some have special effects where you may use more, or if you land on a zone where you can use the card effects, you can use it when you land on these designated zones.\n\nAll in all it is not a bad game, but I would like to see a lot more available within it.  The base concept is fun though, and I like some other features that are included within, like a voting system that allows the player with the highest amount to bypass certain penalty zones.  The misfortune spots you pass over make things interesting too, since something bad happens pretty much every time you pass over or land on one.\n\nEnding up in jail can have its perks too, since certain cards can be used there, and you build up experience the longer you spend time there during the course of a game.  The can be advantageous in certain situations, or with certain cards you can play in that zone.\n\nAnyway, this game is not for everybody, but I think it's good for what it is.  I hope it will be improved upon for more varieties, especially from level to level.  Some kinds of customizable decks or something similar would be a nice edition as well.  I would probably try to catch this one on sale sometime, as I do think the price is a bit high for what it is right now.  Anyone into board game style games genres should give this a try.\n\nWhile I don't play multiplayer on many games, and I didn't really try it on this one, I would think there is a lot of value to that aspect, if one is so inclined - not sure how big of a community there is, so I cannot comment there at all.  It can be a challenging game, and I think there is a lot of potential for this one to become better with more development.\n\nSince I do think the price is a little bit high, I would suggest a demo so that somebody can know what they're getting into before paying the price it currently goes for on Steam.  Other than that, I have no real big complaints.  The mechanics are well done, and for what it is, everything fits well.  As I noted, I think there is a lot of potential, and I hope to see this evolve more down the road to become even better!\n\n** Disclaimer:  I was given a key to review the game.

Some people might argue that it is too RNG based, but if you think/plan better than your opponents you will win. RNG is not too much of a factor IMO if you know how to handle it. Coming from playing lots of Hearthstone, I know what true RNG feels like and this is nowhere close to Hearthstone levels of RNG.

Today, developers came with it and i definately happy now!. because game is taking so long time if you choose long session. hard to finish quickly. it's taking time honestly. i think, that's why ppl not playing online so much.i just saw 25 ppl as online? but i'm sure it's gonna be more ppl when this game released as full. i'm looking for more and more cards!.\n\nif you have some hesitate about "early access". dont bother it. i believe it's almost full game.","January 24","true","43.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

The game screams $40-$60 value but we get it for only $10.  What are you waiting for?  Grab this game as it is a clever, creative, fun, strategic, and challenging romp.  You certainly don't need to be a board game fan to enjoy the innovative game mechanics.  There are no machine guns or gore settings,  but if you enjoy a complex yet simple to grasp game with fun decisions at every turn, get this.  A better single player experience is promised but you still can play solo against bots.  The Devs claim the AI is currently "stupid" (their word) and although there is player to player interaction there is so much more to this game that I find myself involved in beating the game itself and not necessarily beating the other player.  I just can't say enough about how impressed I am with the quality and innovation of this game.   And remember, being in Early Access means there is more to come!!\n\nP.S. I wanted to add I have more than 15 hours playing time.  I play most of my games with Steam in the off-line mode and apparently it does not record playing time.  I had to go on-line just to log 30 minutes so I could post this review.","November 6, 2015","true","5.4"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

To me I think it would make the game a bit unfair.\n- Nice graphics\n- Neat music use when you are in different places of the board\n- Ranked and non-ranked games\n\nCons:\n- A bit too luck based for me\n- Only one playable board, gets boring after awhile\n- AIs need to be tweaked\n- No way to freely chat in games\n\nOverall, this game is a 7.5/10 for me.","March 22","true","42.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It's fast and easy to learn, the interface looks intimidating at first, but it becomes intuitive fast. Aesthetics are great, music is great (just not enough of it!). I also enjoy the references to Eador: Genesis, another amazing game by some of the people behind Gremlins, inc.\nThe game is a little random but it's not too bad (for a board game), just don't expect a "balanced" game every time, sometimes you're just unlucky and spend half of the game in jail or draw all the wrong cards at the wrong time. That said, there is some strategy and depth to it, it's not just watching RNG happen, plus you also have to take other players and their goals into consideration.\nThe game is always online. The single player mode is really just a tutorial, this game is made to be played with other people.

This boardgame is chaotic, wacky, conniving, frantic, frenetic and frenzied. The luck of drawing random cards is involved, but don't discount skill and there are just enough tangible factors involved - like Karma, Income and Politics - to feel you're building and progressing despite an ever changing world. A single one of your opponents cards can upset everything, but managing to come up with a plan by carefully balancing the use of your cards for either movement or playing them on specific spots for value, and have that plan last the total anarchy long enough for you to execute, even in spite of your enemies' best attempts, is a massively satisfying rush.\n\nWhat I like best about this game, is the mood and atmosphere it sets. The artwork is gorgeous, the attention to detail heart-felt and the little ambient noises really set the tone. If you want to experience the rush of being a conniving little greedy gremlin swaggering down the high street of  a clockwork world, clawing at straws, willing to sell your grandmother to the devil for a dime and gain even the slightest bit upward momentum at the expense of your opponents in a chaotic world where fortunes can shift in an instance, I would wholeheartedly reccomend it.\n\nBeing foiled might smart a bit and I wouldn't reccomend it to people who hate reliance on luck, but in my opinion the occasional stroke of genius where everything goes the way you planned despite it, more than makes up for that.","May 7","true","40.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the latest Indie Strategy Board Game to find it's way into Steam's Early Access, Gremlins, Inc.\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\nhttps://youtu.be/xF3I3uUtU4w\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\nOne of the best board games on Steam. Get some friends and play. They  run Tourneys. 5/5\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\nNow this, fellow gamers, is an absolute GEM hiding away on Steam! First, it's based on a real life tabletop game of the same name. I have, unfortunately, not yet played the real life version. I will not be able to make those comparisons here. I can, however, tell you that I enjoy this game so much, that it is easily one of my favorite games on Steam right now. I haven't even found someone to play with yet other than the AI!! With friends, I can only imagine how much more fun this can be. Also, get this, they run REAL, RANKED Tournaments! Now, for the game itself? Beautiful. The art-style is simply gorgeous and the music and sounds fit the Steampunk Gremlin world very well. The gameplay mechanics are simply really, especially after you play through the very well crafted tutorial. It is easy to get a firm grasp on what to do after you get over the inital overwhelming feeling of "What the hell am I doing and where am I going?!". There are resources to manage as well as strategy involved. There are cards that are drawn and played, but this is NOT a CCG. No micro-transactions or deck building, each player has the same cards. Your goal is to get, by any means necessary, the most Points. Points can be earned various ways around the board and typically require good strategy and resource management to pull off (time, placement and money). There is all kinds of chicanery at play though, with misfortunes literally around every corner, corrupt police, jails, there is even times where the game stops to vote for a Governor. That's right, you can accumulate Votes (optional, all part of different strategies) to get elected and get yourself some benefits. Stuck in Jail? It's not as bad as you think...you can make a career of it and earn resources just as easily. The only thing missing from this game, frankly, is a bigger community and more people playing it. The bigger this grows, the better it will be.

That being said, do the tutorial, because at first it is VERY confusing. But don't sweat, after about 15 minutes, you know how 75% of the game plays. The rest is fine-tuning a strategy and knowing when to play what card and for to what purpose.\n\nFor the price, this game is a must if you like strategy games or board games, or just want to try something different and support promising game devs. Kudos.","March 14","true","44.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

This is what Gremlins Inc. is to me.\n\n- Easy to learn but complicated enough to be fun for a lot of hours\n- A huge amount of player interaction (fun interaction at that! Send your enemies to jail, swap places with them, take their money, do everything to stop their plans.)\n- Very good art design.\n- Superb audio\n- Matchmaking system! Click a button and get to play with random strangers climbing the ladders or simply having fun.\n\nFrom the negatives, i would say the game is somewhat RNG heavy and i generally dislike that. This game dropped the standard "roll the dice to move" mechanic and removed that part of rng which is good. There is however a lot of RNG involved in pretty much any spot on the map (roll the dice to get a misfortune, earn less money, go to jail).\n\nAll in all this is an excelent game i can highly reccomend to anyone looking for a "board game" to play with friends/strangers online.","March 19","true","40.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Move around the board, play cards to get victory points, and screw over each other in the process. Don't let early access deter you from picking it up either, suprisingly polished and very fun. If you have friends that love board games it's one to consider playing with them. As far as multiplayer goes, the community seems to be fairly small currently but hopefully more pick it up for multiplayer. There is a singleplayer mode, however, and the AI seems to be decent.\n\nThe biggest con in my opinion is simply no text chat in lobbies or during play. For that alone I can not completely recommend it. If it does not bother you it is a very enjoyable game, but if you do not have friends or the likes to play with and like the social aspect of board games than possibly you might want to stay away until they include some chat function. I understand the reasons, such as fear of abuse and such as the devs have said on the forums, but I feel it is a poor reason given that it nonsensical to think you can protect everyone and make them happy.\n\nStill, saying that, it is a thumps up from me.

Of course, RNG is a factor here, yet there are various mecahnics in place to help you cope with the odd piece of terribad RNG, even a playstyle which can somewhat accomodate Bad RNG (jail isnt that bad when you are The Don, and you never have to worry about bribes).\n\nThere is also a great deal of deception involved, you may not want to draw attention to yourself, and so dont cash in your easy cards, so you can play a game-changer later. You can also play the quiet game until you get elected governer, before steamroling the opposition.\n\nThe game and baord itself also has a great deal of detail, the ambient music changes depending on the location of the board you are in, and strangely enough, there is a great deal of immersion (odd for a board game). The card descriptions and artstyle also make this game an intriguing delight.\n\nOf course there are downsides:\nSometimes long games can drag out simply because you set the turn times too long (although when you get good you can just use 'fast' turn times and this problem goes away)\n\nRNG gives, other players take it away.\n\nAt the moment, I would like there to be more kinds of "ranked games", I would personally prefer the option  to  play fast turned ranked games with a higher turn limit.\n\nOverall, if you are the kind of person who thinks "Will I get my money's worth" (bnasically meaning will I get an hour for each £ i spend) I can definately say that you will get your moneys worth and more, after 11 hours, I still am itching to play far far more.\n\n\n\n\n","March 20","true","26.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Not even the 1st tutorial challenge where you get extra income and starting money. This game is tough and the A.I. fights you like a real jerk. It's relentless and crafty. Obivously, in a game like this, there is a certain amount of RNG you have to deal with, but I believe enough of it has to do with skill and your ability to use the cards you have to get further ahead. It's hard to describe what a round consists of as there are several strategies to reach a victory. As I haven't won yet and have rage quit every round after about 15 turns because it's usually around then that either one or both of my opponents screws me by taking my victory points or some board event happens that steals everybody's money and leaves me in last place. Perhaps I could keep playing those rounds and maybe I'd win, but it always happens right after I feel about to cement my victory and it's extremely aggravating.\nDespite that, I keep coming back and trying to win. It's very addictive and fun. Even though I keep losing, I keep trying and there's not many games I can say that about. Maybe it's the premise of making money and screwing people over, maybe it's because I like the blend of luck and skill, I don't know.

The game is deep and well designed with a lot of different systems that work well in tandem with each other, having you to consider every single factor twice to make sure you dont get screwed.The game is beautiful with a fantastic artstyle that makes everything a joy to look at. Overall this game is a must play for strategy game fans, especially those who like playing mp strategy as the experiences you want from that type of game are right up your ally here.","June 5","true","7.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I decided to keep the game and I am glad I did.\nGremlins Inc, is a virtual board game.\nIn Gremlins Inc, you can go from a pleb to a god in a few rounds, unlike monopoly in which your fate is usually determined from the beginning.\n\nPros:\nSingle player mode, which is bassicaly challenges you can't customize.\nMultiplayer. in which you can play against other people but you can also set up a lobby and play agianst yourself and A.I, lobbies are fully customizable.\n\nCons:\nI stated in my last review that the tutorial could be fleshed out a little more and that still sticks true to me, other than that, I can't think of any cons.\n\n------\n\nSome intersting features that differ from some table top games you may have played are:\nOn the board there are these spots where you have to pay bribes, if you become the governer (elections happen every X amount of round) you don't pay bribes and you can collect the bribes payed by other players (you gain infamy if you choose to take the bribe)\n---\n\nInstead of rolling dice to move on the board like in most games, your cards that you get have a specific amount of spaces you can move if you discard the card.\nThis creates an interesting strategy mechanic in which you have to way out your worst cards and move accordingly, in some cases you will have to give up one of your best cards if you want to move somewhere good.\n---\n\nIn Gremlins Inc there is a unique punishment system that determines the fate of the game a lot.\nCertain spaces and certain thing can trigger things called 'Misfortunes'\nWhen you get a misfortune it is random and in most cases it will be something bad to you, in rare cases it can be benificial. Some cards can be played to make it so you can choose someones misfortune instead of it befalling you.\n\n--\n\nOverall Gremlins Inc was a great buy and I am very glad I did not refund it, if you like tabletop games and are looking for a unique exeprerience, I can't recommend this game enough.\n\n\nNow I just need to find some friends that will get this so I can play it 24/7 :P","December 9, 2015","true","8.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This game is in now way a COLLECTABLE card game with microtransactions. Every player starts with the same deck, therefore making the game equally fair to start off with. The gameplay itself is rather deep, and it'll take a few games to understand how to play the game properly. Although the tutorial is well done, I would suggest playing a few games against AI to get some actual experience of how to play the game properly.\n\nGameplayOkay so let's start off by talking about the gameplay of Gremlins Inc. The gameplay itself is very relaxed and casual to play as you would expect from board games, it is also has very deep gameplay to it. You are going to need to pay full attention when you are playing a proper game, as this isn't a card/board game where you can just leave it alone while doing something else. That being said the tutorial is a massive help when it comes to helping you out with the game, although you may feel you may know everything about this game, I would suggest playing a few games against the AI to get proper experience. This is because, for me anyways, the gameplay takes some time to get used to. Also when you play online you get ranked when you finish a match which then puts you against players with the same skill level as you. I myself would of prefered to play against some of my friends, as I woudl of found it a better and delightful experience to paly against others , rather than random people with the same skill level as me. The strategy in this game is more long term planning and pays out very rewarding if you are able to achieve this long term plan. Obviously some games will turn out better than others and some of you're plans may fall into place better than others. The gameplay feels well balanced between RNG and skill, the RNG comes into play when you gamble or when you use a card to move along the board. That being said, sometime it can be wildly unpredictable and then mess up your plans that you have been planning for the last 5 or so turns. There are some really nice mechanics that other board games like this don't use making the gameplay more unique and fun to play. The variety of cards that you can get also is really nicely done, from the good to the bad cards that you can collect throughout the game, that can be played against others or played against yourself. A few flaws the gam has with this game is that it requires a constant internet connection, even if you're just playing on the tutorial or playing against the AI. I'm not sure why that is because you can play single player to sharpen up on your skills of the game. The game also lasts a fair while, the quickest game that I played was about 30 minutes, but some games can last up to a hour and a half. If you don't like playing a board game that last a fair while then I wouldn't recommend getting this game.\n\nArt StyleGremlins Inc. has some very nice art style implemented into the game which makes it more visually appealing to play. From the detail on the board with the city details and such, from the characters themselves all looks very polished up and well detailed. There is a nice variety of characters that all seem to have the same amount of detail and work put into each of them.\n\nMusic & SoundsThe game has some pretty solid sounds and music that really fits the calming and casual type of game. Although when you have been playing it for a while I would like some different music and sounds effects as they do get repetitive to listen to. I ended up putting on my own music becuase if the repetitive music from the game.\n\nConclusionThis is a awesome strategy card game, with suprisingly no microtransactions and some really fun and casual gameplay. There is some very deep gamepaly, so playing the tutorial is essential to learn the basics of the game. There is a nice community on multiplayer, which means it is also active and you will always be able to find a match on mutiplayer against other people. You're going to need a constant internet connection to play this game, otherwise it kicks your from the game (yes even in single player) so if you have a dodgey internet connection then you won't be able to play the game very well.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Good Games Giveaways & Reviews curator group here.","March 15","true","3.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

I enjoyed most of the gameplay but my only negative I would have to say is the card selection.  Most of the cards only do 1 of 3 things.  So other than earning resources for yourself, they can also detract resources from your opponent, give you election points and money.  So I didn't think the card diversity was all that great, BUT, it was adequate for a small board game like this.\n\nThe art style is quite incredible.  You can instantly see that the developer got some quality talent for the character portraits and in game card art.  The music and sound design is also top notch.  It has that sort of ridiculousness you would come to expect from a board game involving goblins.\n\nIn the end however, I refunded it because I just didn't like how you use cards for moving and for using abilities.  I didn't really seem like there was much strategy.  You either use the cards you have to move around as quickly as possible because you have like 2 -3 cards that will give you alot of resources, OR, you move around to all the money making points and hope the opponent doesn't send you to jail.  Going to jail really sucks.  It has happened to me quite frequently.\n\nI really can't describe it.  But the cards didn't seem all that interesting and I've been playing games like Magic for decades.  I realize this is more of a board game than a card game.  Since there isn't a neutral vote I'll vote yes, but try it for the first 2 hours and see if you like the card selection. If not, refund.","March 11","true","0.9"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","11","22","2","0"

I also feel like money is too underwhelming. Even sitting on roughly 2000 dollars, I am unable to accomplish very little due to enemies spamming "Go to Jail" cards on me, causing me to sit roughly 80% of the game in jail. I guess it'd be more fun if there was some defensive options, but the game is typically "spam all your punishments on 1st place dude until he is no longer 1st, then spam on new 1st place".

I read that the developers will eventually get around to making an offline mode but who knows how long that'll take (they did say sometime in 2016). I also read that they will only develop for the online feature once the offline feature is made since they primarily care about multiplayer which is extremely disappointing. Expansion packs should be made for BOTH single player and multiplayer period. This game looks fun and does come with great reviews but for all of us who only care about an OFFLINE MODE, I cannot recommend this game to anyone till that is fixed.","June 6","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I'm just going to jump right to it. I give this game a 3 out of 10.\n\nSome people will like this game, and I can see why. It has a fun theme, has an interesting board (despite being static), and presents a challenge in trying to find out the optimal line of play.\n\nThese are the biggest 3 issues I have with the game.\n\n1 - It just doesn't look/feel cleany designed. It has blatant kingmaking issues, and far too much "take that". The board is hard to read. The twisted roads and direction symbols required close scrutiny to discern which paths were available to take in trying to reach a destination. The cards have the effects listed in strange places on them that doens't flow well. I had a hard time discerning what most of the cards did, and what conditions were required for effects to resolve. I figured out most of it by the end of my first game, but there were still times where I would play a card on the space I was supposed to and the effect I thought would go off just didn't happen. A mix of too much information in your hand, board, and the inability to easily understand what was going on in both make this game inaccessible to put it mildly. I would guess that about 5 games in most people would get a feel for the board and most of the cards, but I honestly didn't have the patience to do so. It was a chore and the other listed reasons, amoung others, explain why. I have played enough games (both video and tabletop) to see patterns and know what I consider to be flaws with a short playtime.\n\n2 - The gameplay is not engaging. I'm well aware that the entire game is nothing more than a convoluted math problem, and every move I make is just going to be a half ♥♥♥♥♥ attempt to guess which choices are the most mathematically sound. This is the aspect of the game I despise the most, and it happens to be the most important thing. This alone would've gotten a negative review of me. Its a bad mix of imperfect information and wonky rng. Some will like it. I hate it, and it is the main reason I can confidently say "I hate this game".\n\n3 - Player interation is forced. Its rare, its annoying, the variance is too high, and most of it is just cheap "take that". I dislike multiplayer games with no player interaction. I feel like this game was made without player interaction, and it just was thrown ontop of it when it was done.\n\n\nI hate this game.","April 8","false","0.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","2"

Lacks gameplay depth. Not enough options for a strategic game, too few crazy events for a fun game.\n2. Feels more like a selfmoving board game than a video game.\n\nI really liked the trailer, the music, the art, but sadly overpromising.\n\nIn the end it is just a board game with next to no cool animations one would expect from a video game. In the trailer you see moving gremlins, but they don´t in the game. Only their character token moves along the tiles. I was hoping for some crazy cards with some subtle animations which underline their crazyiness, but there are no crazy cards at all which makes the game quite boring.\nI´m not sure if they wanted to make the game more strategic and that could be the reason for not introducing crazy cards, but for a strategic game it lacks depth and options. Though, I really liked the emoticons you can use in a multiplayer game.\n\nThe moving is quite simple, you have 6 cards and every card has a dice symbol, if the card is played you can move the number of dots listed. One gets a new card afterwards from the deck. If you land on a tile you can play a card that has the same symbol and it activates the described effect. Only sad thing is that the cards are quite limited, every player has cards from the same deck, it would been a lot cooler if different capitalists had some character specific cards available and this way a slightly different win strategy, but this is not the case. So it does not really matter which gremlin you play.\n\nThe governor game mechanic is in itsself quite cool, after some rounds a governor is elected, players can try to get those election points while playing the game and if they win they do not have to pay bribes if they pass bribe tiles and can confiscate bribes others had to pay for +1 evil point, but that is all to it. The governor role is not really that important to work towards reaching the most votes and usually the one that happens to have played a card with a lot of votes wins the election. So it is more based on luck to win the election. It would been more interesting if the governor could choose a game rule that applies during their mandate.\nAs I was talking about evil points: They are usually quite useless. It does not really matter if you have a lot of them, it seems the game mostly forgets about them. There is a card or misfortune where you have to pay a little gold for every evil points or the player with the least evil gets an additional 3 votes for an election, but besides those cards there are not any mechanics that could make them more fun. Malice/evil points just sit in your stats without making a real difference. It could really improve gameplay if the developers added more malice related events to cards. For example: A player plays a card to get win points, as the second part of the event the player with the most malice is send to prison or the player with the least malice is getting corrupted and gets a win point and +5 malice. Something along those lines could make the game a lot more worthwhile.\n\nAs it stands I can not recommend it, perhaps for a lower price, but not the current €14.99.","March 13","false","13.1"," 21 of 45 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","21","45","3","0"

Sure it is playable with 3 players assuming one could get over the occasional series of a lot of bad luck D6 rolls and some global misfortune cards and several send directly to jail or swap places with the enemy cards. Adding a 4th player or upping the victory points for win requirement, makes the game almost unplayable, or just a tedious struggle to reach the place for your last VP without meeting another player or rolling a 1 on a D6 or having jast a random misfortune setback.","March 14","false","6.5"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","7","19","0","4"

On top of that the interface is not fully done yet, and it is often impossible to see where negative effects that hit you came from, since you are only allowed to deal with the result of the negative effect. But that is all just details, that will be solved in patches (or maybe not, the latest patch broke the report bug button), it is not he main problem with the game.\n\nThe main problem, is that is just not a very good board game.

At first I was thinking 'nah, not my cup of tea' ... but then I started reading the reviews and accessed the web site to learn more about it and decided to give it a try.   8 hours of play into it now and I have to say, I'm glad I did, I really like it.   I'm glad I took the plunge.  In-fact, I've been looking around for other similar games (haven't really found any though).\n\nI especially like the pace of the game (i.e. if I need to take a break, I can just walk away for a little while and it will be waiting on my turn when i come back (of course, some times I end up in jail too!) ... although I won't do that if I was playing multi-player.\n\nI keep forgetting I have Chaos Cards available which can really help win the game especially towards the end when the additional malice won't matter anymore.  At least that's what I've used them for so far.\n\nI did find that the high contrast option does make it more comfortable and the user interface is nice.\n\nI don't feel I'm quite good enough to try multi-player yet, but it shouldn't be too much longer.  I've won some of the easier single-player sessions a couple times, really just trying to learn the ins and outs of it at this point.\n","March 18","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
