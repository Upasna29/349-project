Just to get the video removed ASAP!!\n\nSo.. how much has this game improved in the past ten weeks?\n\nThere is nothing new, it's the exact same bugs, problems, glitches, and nearly ZERO content as back in January when I last played it.  I've made a Pro and Con list for you to look at, and despite the developer saying he's made updates since I last played it, it's still a horrid, boring mess.\n\nHere's a big clue.. When you watch the preview trailer above, it looks pretty impressive.  However, any time you see a preview trailer showing fly-throughs over his terrain rather then actual true gameplay, it's likely for a good reason.. because the developer is embarrased to show you the actual horrid looking combat, animations, and true gameplay.\n\nAlso at this time, there are 10 reviews.  Only mine is negative.  The developer is filing copyright claims on anyone on youtube showing the actual gameplay, hmmm.  A developer willing to file copyright claims of people showing actual gameplay is obviously dishonest.  So, I would bet money that just about every single "positive review" here was given a free copy of this game in exchange for a thumbs up review.  - Just sayin'\n\n\nPros:\n- Decent graphics for the world and buildings, especially the trees.\n\nCons:\n- Way over-priced for what you get, even if the game is on sale for $3 USD\n- Combat is bland, boring, uninspired, and nothing more the mashing your mouse button.\n- Tons of gliches, bugs, and weirdness (game-breaking)\n- Nothing to do as almost every building is either empty or closed up with no entrance\n- Quests are kill a bear or bandit or find 10 coins, of which two of the quests are still broken\n- Besides killing the same bland, boring and horrid-awful looking bandits over and over and over, there is absolutely nothing to do.\n- Even if I missed certain mobs somehow, there is no way in hell that I care to actually play this game long enough to figure out how to find them 'nor do I want to fight them with this games clunky, lame, and broken fighting mechanics.  Bleh.\n- Potions cannot be moved to your hotbar\n- No skills.  No leveling up.  No upgrades to character.  No special attacks.  No nothing except mashing your mouse buttons.\n- No loot drops found.\n- Character goes invisible and cannot be seen. (yes, even in 3rd person view)\n- Jumping is ragged and hangs in the air and makes you look and feel like a lame tard.\n- No lore, no history, no purpose set at the beginning, nothing to tell you why you are there, what your goal is, or why you are even playing this game\n- Just nothing fun to do anywhere.  No chests to open.  No crates to smash.  No animals seen running around.  No wind blowing the grass.  It's just boring and bland and the only thing this game screams at you is "UNINSTALL ME NOW!"\n\n* This game is easily one of the absolute worst and most boring games I've ever played.\n\nMy rating:  5% of out 100\n\n\nYou can watch the video I made back in Januray about this developer filing a copyright claim against my first review to get it removed from all eyes here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsLigk60oYk&feature=youtu.be","January 13, 2015","false","2.5"," 219 of 269 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","219","269","10","18"

I will be happy to change this review if I get any kind of answer. I am so sorry I never returned this game. It is very unfinished, not much going on which is a shame because it looked like it really had potential. Live and learn I guess, do not make my mistake.","September 15, 2015","false","1.3"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","37","40","0","10"

However, I think that it's easy to understand what they want the game to become and I like the idea - I think it got potential. If you want to support these indie developers and play the game in it's different stages, I think you should buy it - otherwise, eh...","December 23, 2014","false","2.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Last game update was back in Febuary 2015 this is late December 2015.  In October 2015 the developers promissed an update in November.......that never happend.  My guess is they took what money they did make, scrapped the project and ran.  This game is no where near complete, do not waist your money on the hopes that one day it may be complete, this is a broken, unfinished and abandoned game.","December 27, 2015","false","1.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
