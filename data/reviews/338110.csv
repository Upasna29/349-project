Yes\nIs it overpriced a little? Yes\nDoes this make it a bad game? No.\nNow that we have that out of the way, on to the mini review.\n\nWhile exploring the ancient pyramid of 'Khaba', Michael gets trapped inside leaving only a light source to use as the escape plan. Bouncing the light source between orbs and mirrors, Khaba is a puzzle game that will quickly suck you in to a false sense of security. Levels do appear quite simple at first, but gradually introduce new mechanics that will quickly have your brain melting, more so if you try and collect all the green scarabs that unravel some of the secrets contained within the tomb and Michaels past history.\n\nFully voiced story with a decent soundtrack. Controls well, has multiple zoom levels and never did I feel like I was fighting the camera. Graphics are not fantastic but far from bad and more then adequate for the theme and genre.\nShould keep puzzle fans entertained for a while so it gets my upvote, though price is a bit high (imo). Checkout my gameplay video if you are still not sure. Cheers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qBTG0hRfkM\n@developers,\nWould suggest looking into adding some achievements and maybe steamcloud support.\nPeople love them and moving your progress between machines is always nice :)","January 14, 2015","true","1.1"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","4"

Khaba has a pretty cheesy story, but the puzzles are fun and not overly challenging. It's a good casual time filler.","January 4","true","5.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/travizty/recommended/338110/","travizty","TraviztY ãƒƒ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/travizty/","726 products in account","I see Khaba as a mix between God of Light and the puzzle aspect of Deadfall Adventures. With a top down view, you refelct a light beam to open passages, doorways and secrets, with a main goal of guiding the light beam to the last door. The game does get pretty tricky once you start advancing in levels, but it also has a repetitive feel like most games ported from tablet. I'm not saying its bad, I just feel like I'm doing the same thing I was doing the previous level, just in a different way. Pretty much just a game to pass some quick time, like you would on a phone or tablet as you're waiting at the DMV or something. The game also has a story line that goes with it. You take the place of Michael, an explorer looking for the secret treasure from the Dark Pyramid in Khaba. He gets trapped and must use the light beam to open doors. This is where the game really takes the feel of God of Light, which is also a tablet game. The story is also accompanied with voice acting, which I really like to see in games. I'm not one for reading the story so that was a plus.\nIf you like puzzle games like these then I would recommend picking it up, but I would honestly wait for a sale. The $10 price tag is a way high in my opinion, considering you can pick it up on Android for $0.99\n","January 21, 2015","true","0.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Using two different beams of light your goal is to manipulate those beams of light in order to open doors to get your character further into the pyramid and find the treasure.  Most of the puzzles are pretty simple up until the last couple (Khaba Steam screenshots section will help if you need it).  Story is pretty thin, you can see the regular ending coming for most of the game.  There appears to be a second ending if you manage to collect all the green scarabs on each level, however I can't say for certain and though the puzzles were okay, I wasn't a big enough fan to spend my time trying for the scarabs.\n\nGame is fun for the most part, however for at most 5 or 6 hours of gameplay tops and no replayability I would recommend waiting for a sale.","October 13, 2015","true","5.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Anceint Egyptian motifs accented the pyramid exploration with atmospheric music and the occassional  voice acting to enhance the mood and advance the "story". The difficulty ramps up gradually over the twenty eight levels, In the later levels there was definitely enough challenge to provide satisfaction when I solved them, but I did find myself wishing for a few more levels. Overall it was time well spent and, if you can get it on sale, I would recommend.","February 8, 2015","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The voice acting was good, and there was a bit of a story.  But actually, I really appreciated the stripped-down nature of this game.  It's only a series of laser-and-mirror puzzles.  Almost all of the levels are challenging, and some are very difficult.  I'd say each level stands alone, unlike in many games with environmental puzzles, where you learn a trick at one point and reuse it later.\n\nThe controls are slightly imprecise, perhaps because this is a mobile port.  It's easy to accidentally bump one of the mirror-type things out of alignment and have to redo parts of the puzzle as a result.  I would have also liked to be able to zoom out just a little bit further.  But overall, this is a good, solid puzzler.","July 14, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I appreciate that the writers gave the main character a backstory, but the information comes up in jagged bits as he enters each new chamber.  "Hey, I figured out the chamber.  If only my wife hadn't left me and taken the kids with her."  After a few chambers, you uncover a god who likes to dole out bits of the pharoah's story in an omnious voice.  The sequence is: wander in to a room, get a random thought from the "hero", solve the scarab part of the chamber, get a foreboding sentence or two from the god, then solve the rest of the chamber.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  The two sets of dialog don't mesh that well together, so it comes across as a mash-up of 2 incredible disparate Twitter feeds.\n\nOverall I liked the puzzle play, but there are a few glaring problems.\n\n1)  You can't zoom out all the way to see the entire puzzle chamber.  After the first few rooms, you have to pan around to see all the parts of the chamber.  Not only is this annoying and unnecessary for game play, but it's very easy to accidentally reposition an obelisk instead of moving the camera.  With some of the obelisks requiring very precise positioning, having them get bumped around is monitor-punching frustration.\n\n2)  The game mechanics aren't well explained.  Most of it is pretty intuitive.  The scarabs, though, are not.  I thought the scarabs had to be destroyed when lining up the light ray to the exit.  They don't.  They do need to be destroyed by the blue light, all three at once, but the light ray doesn't need to be accomplishing any thing else during that time.  I wasted a stupid amount of time trying to nuke them while opening the exit from the chamber.\n\nDespite the flaws,  it's a fun game that most people should find challenging with a story that is unintentionally amusing.","March 12","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
