"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MavCor/recommended/332800/","MavCor","My lizard wearing a leash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MavCor/","27 products in account","This game is very educational and teaches kids many things. The story is well thought out, and you must use your mind to conquer the game.\n\nYou play as a man named Jeremy, who is a Jedi and can wind up things in other rooms. He must wind up a music box to keep his very skinny son from running down the hall and giving him a big kiss, because you know, he loves him and stuff. You must also watch out for other animatronics, because they tend to wander around the restaurant to find someone to play chess with. The old animatronics in the supply closet are too socially awkward and wander around to find a friend, too. If they end up in your office, you must put a mask on to remind them of their grandpa ol' fredbear and teach them discipline. I guess Jeremy hates chess, so he must defend himself from getting distracted and getting $100.50. Now, foxy is a big dancer. So to make him go away, you must flash strobe lights in his face and give him a seizure while you try to use the force on the music box. Eventually, the animatronics will survey the vents for critters blocking them. Also, balloon boy is a big problem you must worry about. He graduated at the finest school of engineering, and if he gets in your office, he will disable your lights and flashlight :(\n\nI give this game a 8/8.

Terrifying and fast paced in the later nights. If you don't have good reaction times, you won't make it through night 5-6. as of right now, I have only beaten night 5. I won't reveal much but the balloon boy is probably the /most/ annoying AI as it is pure luck in night 6 that he won't come in and screw things up for your night. the new golden freddy (yes, he is indeed back) has 2 ways to get you. and both are equally frightening. I've never been more afraid to see a floating bear head in my life.\n\nNew AI: 9/10 - annoying, but Hella hard to outsmart.\nStoryline: 8/10 -- albeit short, there is not really much needed to be said. seems like scott is trying to drag us along slowly into a very deep, dark hole we call the story of "five nights at freddy's".\nReplayability:5/10 -- this really depends on your interests, IMHO. this is more of a "one and you're done" kinda game.\nsecrets and extras: 8/10 -- I've seen a lot of little things if you have time to pay attention and explore. the  custom night is great as well.\n\nall in all,\nTL;DR: Great new addition, 2SPOOPY5ME, more story, definitely worth it if you want five more nights in Hell.","November 13, 2014","true","20.6"," 335 of 387 people (87%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","87","335","387","21","1"

This one is by far the most difficult but it also has the most content. if you are looking for a challenging horror game with a decent backstory, Go ahead and buy FNAF 2.","December 4, 2014","true","46.1"," 1,021 of 1,287 people (79%) found this review helpful 79 people found this review funny","79","021","1","79","13"

It's terrifying with the sounds off.\nGameplay: This game produces a wonderously stressful experience wich will keep you at the edge of your seat at all moments. 9/10\nGraphics: The game's appearance changed very little, and still look grainy. I honestly don't even think this game has any lighting system. 6/10\nScare factor: That wonderous feeling you get when your freind jumps out of you the five hundredth time-- is stale... Experienced players will find this more of a challenge than a horror game, but new players will get a kick out of it. 7/10\nOriginality: I honestly have never seen a game like this.

Despite this it is still an excellent game. Scott made the right decision by altering gameplay and removing the doors; Five Nights at Freddy's began to see many uprising strategies to easily beat the game without much to worry about, but with 11 animatronics running around, attacking from 3 directions this time, strategies have become almost useless. Five Nights at Freddy's 2 began much differently than it's predecessor. I was there, with many others, the minute it was released on steam, but the first Five Nights at Freddy's only began to see popularity after youtube playthroughs such as Markiplier's. Although I cannot get past night 4, this is a great game, I have had a lot of fun in the short time I have played and I plan to have a lot more. I rate this game 20/20/20/20/20/20/20/20/20/20!

You'll miss some "story", and this second one is significantly more complex and fantastically frustrating than the first.\n\nThere are some pros and cons to this new game that I should address, though.\n\nPros:\nMore killer robots\nA better "Chuck E Cheese" feel\nNew audio cues\nPerplexing 'story' elements\nM. Scott ShamaCawthon\nMildly spookier death scream\nInteresting game mechanics\n\nCons:\nMusic Box ruins the gameplay\nSome of the original atmosphere is lost\nJumpscares are not well-animated\nToy Chica loses her face after leaving the stage?\nNew animatronics are ridiculous in terms of how to survive them\nYou can beat the game with a boring and lame strategy (light, hall, light, music box, mask, repeat)\n\nRecommendations to Scott:\nNerf that dang music box\nAdd new, better death animations for extra spook\nAdd a new, better death screen\nGive each Robo-beast a unique death scream\nAllow us to be able to hear the characters making unique noises (like Bonnie playing a guitar, or the old ones glitching)\nTry to make each scare intense and horrible, make the nights longer, and the robots slower.\nThe animatronics should be horrifying and feared, not a pain in the rear.\n\nAnd one last thing:\nDo not release your game without warning without refining it a little! We wanted a horror game, not a "god damn it, Balloon Boy!" game.\n\n\nTL;DR\nHad promise, but it could have been a lot spookier. If you were a huge fan of the first one, get this game. If you didn't play the first one, and you want to play it for the scares, you will be confused and disappointed.\n\nSince I like the gameplay for the most part, and most people who want to purchase this game will have played the original, I recommend this game.","November 12, 2014","true","0.9"," 183 of 219 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","183","219","0","4"

They bother you nonstop and if you don't give them enough attention, they will jump out on you and, apparently, kill you in the process (Idk maybe from frustation or electrolysis).  To further show evidence to this theory, you must work there 7 days a week for 6 hours (assuming that they go to school and sleep).  But, they are not all like that. The older emo ones just stay in their room and skype their friends or listen to music, like Royals or some dumb stuff , but when they want something, they want it immediately.

When an animatronic is outside your door you need to close it, but at the expense of your oh so precious power.\nThis game is scary because of it's atmoshere and the inability to move or fight and because of the silence in the backround with weird noises playing with it. It's mysterious and strange story filled with mythos was also highly welcomed.\nThis game made a massive boom of popularity across the internet [ specificcly youtube ] with let's plays and reaction videos everywhere.\n\nabout a season later in the year we're already back at freddy fazbears pizzeria, but are you getting a warm childrens tune or a fox [ or a puppet ] lunging at us instead? We have unlimited power in this sequel but I still say  it's a harder game, how? Well first of all there are no doors, instead there are 2 vents next to you and a massive passage to a hallway in front of you. Also there are 6 new animatronics, 5 of which want you dead snd the other will make you vulnerble to the rest. So how do escape from their terrible grasp.\nYou have a mask.\nThis mask will fool most of them into thinking your one of them and will keep them at bay, but as I said there are other animatronics that you need to keep away [ conveniently the most dangerous ones ] and their own ways of being tricked seems like a hard chore. Sometimes you'll be caught in a situation where you'll never make it out alive.\n\nThis game is way harder than the original and will rquire more of your freddy fazbear skills. Overall though you should be more entertained by the mysterious story [ and substory ] and setting that ulimately fuels the game.\n\n7.9\nreally good                                                                  PROS:\n- mysterious and cool story with a great horrer setting\n- new gameplay mechanics are good....\nCONS\n- ....but some are a chore\n- really, really hard","November 16, 2014","true","3.1"," 117 of 138 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","117","138","0","0"

Well, i'll add a pro's and con's list.\nWARNING: SPOILER ALERTS.\n\nPros:\nVery fun\nKeeps you on edge the whole time\nYou will get scared, even if you feel brave after the 1000 attempt.\nUp to 7 nights. Nights 1-5, night 6 and custom night (Night 7)\nGreat story line\nLots of easter eggs\nLots of enemies\nLots of jumpscares!\nSmall minigames\nSmall cutscenes\nGreat atmosphere\nCons:\nGame can become more annoying then scary when trying to complete night 5, 6 and certain game modes in night 7 (Such as 10/20 or 4/20)\nNo pause menu(This isn't a problem for me but if you ever need to stop playing to take a break you can't.)\nDull endings (Night 5 is a check, night 6 is a bonus check and a newspaper saying the place is closing and night 7 is you getting fired. No cutscene for any endings)\nToo fast. You will be looking left and right while flashing foxy while winding up the box while putting the mask to hide from bonnie and repeat. One slight mistake and it's back to 12 AM.\n\nepilogue:\n\n\nOverall the game is a fun game to play, you will be scared, you will be astounished by the story behind it and more. The game does get a bit hard towards the end, espically when you get those bonus nights. However, the game is a fun sight to play and even watch youtubers play it.

Uh, well, if you're hearing this, then chances are... you've made a very poor career choice.\n\nReady for Freddy? Again? Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the sequel to the highly praised Five Nights at Freddy's, brings a lot of new stuff to the jump scare filled table. With more animatronics to fend off and zero doors to use, Five Night's at Freddy's 2 knows how to make your horror game horribly hard. Compared to its predecessor, Five Nights at Freddy's 2 has a lot more tricks up its sleeve, with random death mini-games and a ton of easter eggs. But the question still remains, is Five Nights at Freddy's 2 still as scary as it was before?\n\nGameplay Five Nights at Freddy's 2 brings some new gameplay mechanics, as stated above, there are no doors and there is no power generator that can run out. You now depend on a flashlight and a Freddy Fazbear mask. The flashlight is your new power generator in this game. Once you're out of batteries, Foxy will be more than happy to munch your face off. You'll also need this flashlight to shine into the hallway outside your office, and lighten dark corners on the camera feed. The Freddy Fazbear mask is very interesting and works a lot like the old doors. Once an animatronic is in the air vents or in front of you, you'll need to put on the mask to make them go away. If this is not done fast enough, a load jump scare will scare the bejesus out of you. Next to the load of animatronics you have to deal with, you also have to check on the music box every once in a while. If you won't wind up the music box, The Puppet will take good care of you. All these things combined can make some tense scenes, but also a lot of cheap deaths.\n\nConclusion Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is a very fun and jump scare filled game. For the story gamers around us, there is a lot of background story to uncover, the forums are full of predictions and theories! But like i said, there are a lot of cheap deaths in the game. Night five and six are mostly based around luck, and make you do the same strategy over and over again. But really, who hasn't heard about Five Nights at Freddy's now? If you're a horror fan who can take a lot of jump scares and fun but sometimes unfair gameplay mechanics? This is your game.

The strategy element that made the original Five Nights at Freddy's so fun to play has been amped up to the maximum here. The game's use of micro-management keeps the player engaged at all times, perfectly complimenting the ominous soundtrack, audio cues and general atmosphere of the game that presses not only fear upon the player, but a whole lot of stress as well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/milkntitties/recommended/332800/","milkntitties","Master Cosby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/milkntitties/","274 products in account","Five Nights at Freddy's 2 has been a long awaited sequel...well long awaited for me I have been very excited about this!!  Does it live up to its predecessor though, did it do things differently to make the formula seem newer?  Well, yes and no Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is a mixed bag for me but make it well known that I have enjoyed what I have played but there are some things that I do not like about it either and maybe it was because it was rushed out, then again maybe it wasnt and creator "Scott Cawthon" was very satisfied with the current build and good on him for that.  But anyway here goes my review of what I have played so far.\n\n\nI love how Scott decided to change it up a little so that we had the same type of game that we originally loved.  Getting rid of the doors to me was a great idea and added a new type of tension and stress initially starting, trying to figure out when to put on the mask and when not to.  Additionally, the addition of another element that requires you to interact can make things alot more stressful and when put in a bad situation where that element needs attention but you cant do it...ADDS alot of stress to the element and I loved that!  I havent delved into the story yet let alone go out of my way to search for it like we had to with the original but I am hoping Scott added more to this because the way the story was hidden in the last game was fun to read.  Now, having said that there are a few things wrong with this game that bug me from the moment I was playing about 10 minutes in...and that was the death animations.  The animations on the animatronics have seemed to have taken a nose dive in quality and polish and that really saddened me because the way that the animatronics were animated in the original it was really good...I mean it was awesome!  Maybe Scott got too excited releasing this game to us and let it get to his head that they were fine, or maybe he was very happy with the way it was.  Either way I do not like them and I hope he may patch that in and give them (mainly Chica and Bonnie) better death animations to you.  Another animation issue I had was with the animatronics showing up at your desk while you have the mask to show there presence to you was....not what I expected.  I actually wanted them to be hulking over you, singing songs, or using their animation that they would employ as if it was them performing in the day time then the lights flash off and they disappear and reset to a different area.  I don't think it was done well and again..I hope that maybe he will patch that and add it into the game.\n\nOverall, I am satisfied with this $7.99 purchase.  It is not perfect by any means and this game leaves room for patching and I am hoping Scott does do it.  I love the game Scott and I really hope that you read this and take my criticism as a productive way to improve on this already well done game.  I recommend this game for everyone, but I want others to play the first "FNaF" first then move on to this one and see the effort that has gone into this game.  Well done Scott and heres to a "FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S 3".  Thank you again Scott for making this sequel.\n\n\nPros:\n- No doors change up ( great switch around to prevent the game from being stale and repeated )\n- More areas to monitor increasing the micro-managing adding to the stress and paranoa\n- The new animatronics look great!\n- Jump scares pretty done well\n\nCons:\n- Animations for when the animatronics enter where you reside are just...not good...like at all and I was left very disappointed on how that was executed\n- Death animations seemed less polished than the deaths on the original 'FNaF' and I was also disappointed in that as well.\n\n","November 10, 2014","true","4.0"," 118 of 151 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","118","151","0","7"

A haunted pizzeria.\nUnlike in the last game, you don't have doors to hide from the Animatronics, instead you get a Freddy Fazbear mask, and a Flashlight. You need to use both of these new gameplay elements, in order to protect from the animatronics. If you see Foxy in the Hallway, you need to flash at him every few seconds, in order to stun him, because the mask doesn't work on him.\nWhen you see any of the new animatronics in the vents' blind spot, you need to put on the mask, and wait until they leave the room.\nThe storyline explains many mysteries from the first game, such as the missing children accident, in which the 5 kids got kidnapped, and stuffed into the costumes of Bonnie, Chica, Freddy, and Foxy. The phone guy calls you every night, telling you hints and what is currently happening, such as the theft of the Golden Freddy costume (The costume of the kidnapper) and how the animatronics are malfunctioning. When you die, there's a chance you get a Atari minigame, which shows what is happening. In one of these, it tells you to "Give Gifts" in which you control Freddy, to give gifts to the children, after you do that, it tells you to "Give Life" and you need to... Stuff the kids into the animatronics' suits.\nThe game is a lot harder, and a lot more scary than the first game. This time you need to look for 10 ANIMATRONICS. In 12 rooms! That's a lot more than in the first game, oh I almost did forgot to mention this: There's a music box in the Prize Corner camera, where you need to wind it up from time to time, otherwise the Marionette will get you.\nThe game has a lot of new mechanics, its a lot more scary, it has a lot of new animatronics, a fitting tension soundtrack when something happens, it's definitely worth the 3 extra dollars.\nIf you liked the first game, get this one definitely. You'll be scared.","November 17, 2014","true","38.1"," 98 of 123 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","98","123","0","5"

This one takes your original skills and stuffs it into Chica's suit.\n\nThis one is much faster paced and MUCH more difficult than the original. It requires extreme reaction timing (tough for lots of people) and lots of awareness. The Marionette, Balloon Boy, and the old animatronics require major skill and bullet speed mouse skills.\n\nAlright, now to even it out with the ol' pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n\nVery fun overall.\nInteresting backstory with a twist.\nThe new animatronics are quirky and fun.\nHas a great difficulty for more experienced gamers.\nSomewhat spooky.\nThe special minigames are to die for (ba-dum-tss), AKA, they're a nice addition.\n\nCONS:\n\nNowhere near as scary (although the jumpscares are pretty jarring) as the original.\nCan be impossible to beat at times.\nRage inducing.\nToo fast paced at some times.\nYou need perfect reaction timing to get past the later nights (3 and on).\n\nOverall, I recommend it, but the first one is slightly better. This one is still very good, though.","January 21, 2015","true","2.1"," 86 of 105 people (82%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","82","86","105","8","0"

The custom night is rather interesting as well because it gives you interesting and difficult challenges that - once complete - will reward you with little plush toy on your desk, which will make you want to collect all of them for a sense of achievement.\nAlthough I don't highly recommend this game, if it's on sale, pick it up.

Mainly because I'd watched so many playthroughs on it, that I went from being scared with the youtuber to laughing at how adorably lacking they are at knowing the strategies. Since this only just come out, I decided to give it a go myself, completely unaware of how many times I would want to shove Foxy's face inside a blender.\n\nHere's the main question you probably want an answer for. Is it good? Absolutely. Is it scary? Kind of.\n\nChances are, you probably know everything about the original FNAF if you take interest in this, so let's talk about the new animatronics.  We have the new Bonnie with his more innocent makeover, who I find scary until Night 3, when he becomes completely tame compared to everything else that is going on. Easily, the least likely to fly in your face.\n\nThe new Chika is basically a slightly better version of Bonnie, and likes to appear in the hallway with a birthday present and a stripper outfit. I wish I could make that up. Then we have the balloon boy who starts in cam 10, then flies off the face of the earth, only to randomly appear in the left vent. I have absolutely no idea where he goes.  But think of him as Nelson from the Simpsons; he's coming for you, with the intent to point and laugh at your failure until you inevitably die. But never actually attack you.\n\nI'll save the rest for you to find out, because finding out is half the adventure. A painful adventure, where you will spend an hour figuring out how to deal  with each enemy.\n\nThe feature with this game that everyone was staining their pants with bleach over, is having no doors to protect you when Chika stands outside the window, gasping at how erect your nipples are. Or at least, that's how I pictured it. She's gotta have that shocked expression for a reason. But who needs a powerful door, when you have the most amazing flashlight, mankind has evar created?\n\nIf you have a friend who is dying from some incurable disease, flick the flashlight at them a few times and they will be skydivng into your mother's bed while holding the olympic torch. At least 4 of the animatronics will come for you from the hallway, to which you can respond by flicking at them for a minute, and they will probably be gone. Which results in the first hour of every night, being a game of red light green light with Foxy. He just loves to join the party early.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point about this flashlight. You will not run out of power. Like evar. One of the most intense parts of the original, was trying to find every animatronic who was trying to kill you, while saving power so you don't have to listen to a small classical piece, then get given a hug from Freddy for the 765th time. Use the camera and flashlight all you want, this time. You have 4 bars of battery life, and they really take their time in going away.\n\nAnd if that doesn't work, then you have the Freddy disguise which really makes me question how Bonnie reacts when he sees a human and then suddenly sees his boss. If anyone comes through the vent, wea the mask and you'll be fine. At least for the most part, but I'll get into that dumb mechanic in a moment.\n\nAnd lastly, we have the music box, which you can just tell was put there just to give the player a reason to check the camera. So with all of these pieces of equipment to use for so many enemies, you're always put on edge with not a moment to rest. Sounds like a formula for a scary game, to me.\n\nAnd it sure is. Most of the people who play this will be sweating like a teenager who is playing pin the tail on the donkey, with the number 1 female student from yoga class. Never a dull moment.\n\nOr at least, that's how it starts off. Point being, this game is hard. And when I say hard, I mean the hard that starts off as frustrating, before quickly downgrading to an expected annoyance. You will die in this game. A lot. Which gives you plenty of time to learn how the mechanics of each animatronic work, and by the time you do, the game becomes as scary as a mansion with a swimming pool made out of jelly. By the time I got to night 4, I knew when every jumpscare was gonna happen, so I just laid back and stared at the screen, waiting for death.\n\n"But Hedgy, if you understand how everything works, then it can't possibly be hard." Well you'd be right if it wasn't for 3 walking, scrawking problems.\n\nOld Bonnie\n\nOld Chika.\n\nAnd Old Freddy\n\nChances are, if you have looked at the discussion section of the FNAF2 community, you will find a lot of people stuck on night 3. And these two are exactly why. Sometimes when you put the camera down, you'll see Bonne in front of you with his mouth hanging open, or Chika practicing her part for the scarecrow in the newest drama performance. You have a grand total of less than a second to put the mask on, or you're dead. And you will be doing this a lot. It will probably end up being the only thing that kills you for a while, and since it's so easy to see coming, it doesn't feel like it's there for horror.\n\nOn a really good day, you'll get all three in a row without a break, giving you no chance to wind up the music box, and hearing the heartwarming sound of the 3 animatronics giggling because of it.\n\nWhich means that night 3 onwards will probably go like this. Flip the camera, wind music box, flash in the hallway, check the vents, occasionially put on mask, repeat until you realise you weren't quick enough, then insert a broken piece of glass through your eye socket. And since there are so many sound effects that tell you where everyone is, you really have no motivation to sight see.\n\nLastly, we have the minigames that sometimes appear after you die. These have you take control of an animatronic, and walk around in a format that reminds me of hotline miami, before getting jumpscared and going back to the main menu. These exist to tell some more of the story, but I'm guessing that Scott didn't realise you would die so much, which makes these easter eggs get old. And fast.\n\nLooking back at this review, I notice that it sounds like I hate this game. I don't, it's great. And still really fun, even though I know when every scare will happen. There is a great challenge that comes with each night, making it feel very satisfying to win. And at first, you do feel legitmate fear. But after a while, it just becomes a challenge to get through the night, the fear having long passed away.\n\nSo, to summarise. It's great, but not as scary as the original","November 15, 2014","true","14.5"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","50","57","0","1"

This game is amazing! I played, and I could not believe how cool it was! There are three things EXTREMELY good about it for me and something I wish...\n\n1. The new animatronics: They look so cool! And they each have a new feature, and a new way to kill you. I also LOVE it when Bonnie slides in the room. He looks just so cute! Like a sicopathic robot, but in the form of a puppy.\n2. The Design: I have to say, this new building and overall layout makes it INCREADIBLY tough to watch everything. The no doors feature caused Ballon Boy and Foxy to team up on me, but that was an awesome team up.\n3. How fluently it runs: This game works better then most other games I have on Steam! So, big plus there. And the price, not too much, not not too low.\n\nWhat I wish is for someone to make a Freddy Cruger Mod to replace Fazbear. Replace Bonnie with another horror movie killer and The Puppet with Jigsaw, and you're all set!\n\nOverall, I definately recomend this game. And, seeing as this just came out now and is a VAST improvement over the first, then that make this, all the better!\n\nReady for Freddy?","November 11, 2014","true","0.7"," 54 of 64 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","54","64","0","2"

In this game, play as Larry Daley, a security guard at the popular Pizzeria, Starbucks. Your goal, just like the last game, is to stop minorities from stealing the Pumpkin Spice formula. Unfortunately, your budget has been cut AGAIN, and you no longer get Military Grade weapons. Instead, you have to fight them off with your fists. This makes the game much more challenging, as you have to get up close and personal. The only problem is, that every now and then, you have to deal with Kermit the Frog. Kermit will come out every time you forget to turn on the Singing Fish on the wall. Other than Kermit, 5 other minorities have been added to the game as well. There is Better b4nny, or Dyrus as people call him. There is also Captain Falcon, Call of Duty Ghost, Bubble Buddy, Batman, and of course, as hinted in the previews, Hatsune Miku. Now, with 11 minorities to worry about, no guns, and Kermit bugging you every time you take a ♥♥♥♥, you must survive through the night by wearing your fursona suit. If you die, you also get to play classic arcade games, like Sonic '06, Superman 64, Super Smash Bros. 4, and Sonic Boom (because Sega paid a lot of money for this game).\n\nBut don't think I didn't forget about the multiplayer! During the game, you will find various Pokemon within the tall grass, which you can capture and collect. Then, you can battle with friends over the Nintendo Wifi Network. They re-added all the original guns from the first game for these Pokemon Battles, and they added new guns, such as the Halo Pistol, and the Gravity Gun. This is the best multiplayer since Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and I can't wait to see where the CoD series goes next.\n\nThe creator of the game ever worked with the makers of Dead Rising to create the new Zombie mode, where you can play as Paul Blart, Larry Daley, Tony Montana, and Captain America to fight off the alien invasion of Weeaboos. This mode also contains a vast story line, but I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone.  Tony Montana dies in the end heuheuhue xDDD ayy lmfao .\n\nI hope everyone enjoys this game as much as I do. Its so wonderful to see the Sonic franchise blow up so much and come out with 2 games in the same year. This will put Battlefield on the run. This game has brought me countless minute of enjoyment, and I highly reccomend grabbing it.","November 20, 2014","true","0.5"," 58 of 75 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","58","75","6","6"

But now its been reopened in a new location and you take the job as the new night security.\n\nA few things have changed now. There are no more doors to keep you safe and you are now left in the open with a corridor in front of you and crawling vents on both sides. The only things you get are a flashlight to see what's coming and a Freddy mask to disguise you from the deadly robots.\n\nYou will find a lot more security cams in the new Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant. Each security cam allows you to turn the viewing area light on and off to see what is hiding in the dark and to see what's coming for you.\n\nNew creepy sounds, locations and deadly robots make this sequel a lot scarier than the previous one.

The noises in the game can scare you, but when you know what noise is which, such as the whirring noise, meaning something is in the hallway, and the metal rucuss of the vents. The Freddy Head is a nice mechaanic to replace the doors, but with the old animatronics, you have to put it down A.S.A.P, which is a tiny bit difficult. The thought of the building not running out of power, can make the player feel a bit safer, but that would inevitably mean the flashlight running out, and death by Foxy. The cutscenes where you are Freddy from the first game, is cool, to see his P.O.V, the multiple changes to them are nice. The Night 6 phone call can throw you off since the first game didnt have one, but Phone Guy explains that the place is shut down since somebody dressed in a yellow Freddy suit, A.K.A Golden Freddy, killed 5 childeren. The return of Golden Freddy was amazing. The game has added a lot to the mechanics, which makes the game scary and more fun. I, personally enjoy Five Nights at Freddy's 2, and cannot wait for the iOS release so I can play it everywhere I go","November 15, 2014","true","3.0"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

Alrighty.\n\nAs a gift from a friend, I really wasn't ready for the amount of scares and pressure comin' my way.\nThe game is nice and seems to play, pretty much the same as the prequel, with a few added features I'll go over right now.\n\n1.Joining the 4 animatronics that everyone is used to, you now have a new set of animatonics that are just as frightening.\n2.Replacing the doors comes the Freddy Fazbear mask(?) that you can wear so whatever creeps its way into your office will creep its way out.\n3.To keep up the tension, there is a music box that must be kept wound up, to prevent a certain animatronic from, well, killing you.\n4.Remember when I said "Replacing the doors"? Yeah, there is one door, two vents. Said vents use the normal lights system from the first game. While the door must be checked using the flashlight.\n5.Speaking of flashlights, you get one! The flashlight can only be used with the cameras to check on things you probably couldn't see.\n\nThe visuals are the same as the first game, but to me it seems to look clearer. The jumpscares are still as scary and somewhat predictable as the first game. And the ambiance is still very unnerveing and tense-keeping.\nI can't really talk about the soundtrack since, like the first, the only things you can hear are the screams from the animatronics, the random sounds you hear around the pizzaria, and the music box I spoke of earlier.\n\nTo conclude, this game sould not be played by people who still have nightmares from the prequel, or anyone who is very vulnerable to jumpscares. But if you have a death wish, or are, frickin', XxMLG_420_GamerxX, give it a try and see for yourself.\nFinal Rating : 8/10","November 11, 2014","true","0.5"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

It does everything right - it offers you more animatronics, instead of less, it adds new gameplay mechanics (and thus new level of difficulty) instead of changing game completely and, the most importantly, it unfolds more story with the minigames (which is unique idea on it's own) instead of making it too confusing and frustrating. I got the feeling that Scott Cawthon, after initial success of his games, which was gain mostly due to FNAF lore that started so many theories, tried to surprise us so much, that, if the Game Theory is right, it lead us to the most disappointing and lazy explanation ever.\n\nFNAF 2 is enjoyable, challenging, cute on it's own weird way and the most importantly, still feel unique, while being a perfect continuation. I would say this is a good place to finish your FNAF adventure.","March 7","true","4.8"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","21","26","3","0"

Classic.\nBeing a huge FNaF fan, I can say that I was insanely hyped for this game. Though unlike some sequels out there, my hype did not die out after playing the game. The scenery is akin to the first game... But in some cases, the gameplay has been completely flipped around. Sure, you're still completely static in a claustrophobic office with only a fan and tablet to keep you company, but that's mostly it. You've still got Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and ( My personal favorite ) Fredward Benson on your tail, but they've brought some friends this time. Sheesh, at points, even paper dolls and shadows are out to get you. The game itself is marvelous, and the storyline is definitely bone-chilling. Especially if you've delved deep into the story of the first game.\n\nOh, I almost forgot; you don't have doors this time either. Ain't that swell?

My biggest gripe is the music box that must be constantly winded. It basically uses up so much of your time that you don't even have a chance to look at any of the other cameras. It really defeats the purpose of having a camera at all. I wish Scott had realized this in beta testing, and waited a bit longer to release the game.\n\nAside from that, it's a fun game. Creepy as ever, with some very interesting additions to the storyline. I love the backstory to this series. Scott has created quite an interesting (yet very disturbing) world with the dialogue alone in this game.

After playing a few nights with him I have to say this game is not only fun, but it's so nerve wracking it's scary. The jump scares from the animatronics are scary, but the tension you feel while trying to not only hide from them, but trying to hold back one of the most aggressive, is intense.\n\nFNaF2 is a thrill ride with simple mechanics that keep you coming back to be scared again and again.","November 11, 2014","true","1.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

Unfortunately for me, Five Nights at Freddy's 2, feels like the exact same game with only minor differences that do little to change the experience. The jump scares seemed more predictable, and thus were not remotely scary, and the mechanics came down to once again pressing buttons and clicking the mouse in the right places as fast as possible without making a mistake.\n\nIf you loved Five Nights at Freddy's, you will probably love this game as it really is more of the same.

If you liked the first one, you'll like the second one. Overall, I just wish there was more to the gameplay. By night three, you've seen most of what the game has to offer, and while the game offers a lot more than the first game, it does get a bit repetitive. I ain't the kind of guy to scream at every little jumpscare that happens in a game -- and you will likely get used to the jumpscares in due time -- but it does contain a rather nice atmosphere and feeling of tension, especially with the new Freddy mask, flashlight, and music box mechanic. It could be better, but hey, it's more unique than the onflux of horrible, deadpan jumpscare games that flood the horror industry in today's gaming market. Here's hoping that FNAF3 will be better.","January 23, 2015","true","0.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

There is much less reliance on the luck of the RNG this time around, and a much higher focus on reflexes and time management. It is a sharp increase in actual difficulty, but for the most part chance is a decreased factor; no longer will Chica deciding to camp your door or Freddy lurking in the corner be an issue. Instead, you have to keep the music box wound up and Foxy appeased via flashing your light. There is no power limit; your flashlight has a battery but after some practice it will become a non-issue. It boils down to slipping on the mask to protect from the main mannequins, flashing your light to keep Foxy away, and checking the camera to wind up the music-box. For lore enthusiasts, there are many more hints and additions, explaining such things as the missing children and the Bite of '87.

The original game had a creepier atmosphere and required a little more strategy in the later nights than this one does, but at the same time it was also more unfair with the random door jamming nonsense. My only major gripe with FNaF2 is that you spend over half your time on the later nights just winding up the dang music box (you'll know what I mean if you've seen some gameplay footage on YouTube). My favorite addition to the gameplay is the little Atari-esque minigames you're sometimes given the option to play if you die; those minigames kinda help to flesh out the lore behind the restaurant chain and the infamous "Bite of 1987". One last thing: managing power isn't nearly as troublesome as it was in the first game. In fact, all you have to conserve now is flashlight battery, and that has not proven to be a problem for me yet (I'm on Night 5).\n\nEDIT: This is the second time Steam has given my review the wrong "hours on record" stat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghiz876/recommended/332800/","ghiz876","Gumi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghiz876/","33 products in account","Watch out, it's an actual review instead of yet another joke review for this game!\n\nThe first Five Nights at Freddy's, while overhyped, is still a pretty solid game. Barely over two months later, this sequel was released. That right there should ring some alarm bells. It certainly is rushed and shows some signs of the creator jumping on to the hype train while the series is still popular, rather than taking his time with a worthy sequel.\n\nTwo of the strongest aspects of the original game's horror were how good the atmosphere was and the spooky sound design. The latter is mostly gone in the sequel, with the former pretty much missing. The first game did a good job of making the pizzeria look frightening, while still matching with the description of a place that is joyous in the day. It doesn't seem like a whole lot of time was put into recreating that feel for the sequel, as the pizzeria is simply bright and colourful this time around, with no spookiness to the appearance of the diner. The only exception is the parts and services room, but of course kids aren't supposed to be there, so no attempt to blur the line of friendly and frightening was needed.\n\nThe sound design isn't even close to matching the quality of the first game's, however some of it shows promise. With some more time testing what does and doesn't work (read: not rushing the game out in barely over two months) the sound design could have been absolutely fantastic. For example, the animatronics Balloon Boy and Mangle have their own unique sounds, which excellently use common horror techniques. Balloon Boy has creepy childish sounds and Mangle pretty much is a ghost box, constant white noise and distorted voices, showing the fear behind chaos. Unfortunately there isn't really a whole lot more special going on in the sound department. The atmospheric sounds are sadly far inferior. They do their job of indicating something dangerous is nearby and that's it. Especially lazy is the sound indicating an animatronic passing through the main hall. It took me a while to realise the sound was indicating an animatronic was so close, since, well... I'm having a hard time figuring out how "extremely repetitive alarm-type noise" ties into someone being in front of you? Somehow the loud footsteps from the first game conveyed that expression better. Additionally, you may know an animatronic is close to you by the sounds of someone moving through the vents. Even this isn't without its flaws however, as the sound has to keep looping if multiple animatronics are active at once, and thus the sound very noticably gets cut off and resets commonly on future nights.\n\nOh yes, the vents... there are many more animatronics in this game than the previous one and most of them travel through the vents. This means there can be more than one in the exact same spot at one time and the only way to really be aware of this oftentimes is to simply guess. Fake difficulty, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense. This was present to a small extent in the first game, although it made more sense as those areas weren't cramped vents.\n\nThe gameplay is much less satisfying than the first game's. This installment requires manic activity from the player. While later nights in the first game certainly required the player to be on their toes, there were still brief pauses while the player had to conserve power, and observation of multiple cameras was necessary to keep an eye on the more active Freddy.\n\nThis game seems to be confused in what it's trying to do, in its attempts to be different, it actually amplifies what it may have been trying to fix. There is no longer a limit to the building's power usage, so cameras can be viewed freely. At first I assumed this meant the player could spend more time checking all the cameras instead of constantly switching back to the office to conserve power, which is a neat idea. However, it's necessary for there to be a vital reason to view the cameras. But oh dear, is that vital reason a drag in this game. There's a music box in the prize corner video feed that needs to be wound up remotely, which for some reason is only possible while looking at that camera. This means the only camera that actually ever needs to be looked at is the prize corner. This becomes MORE repetitive than looking at the office. A mechanic where at least one animatronic needs to be followed camera-to-camera would not only fill the criteria of making camera viewing a necessity, but add some variety. This was achieved with Freddy in the first game, unfortunately not the case in the sequel.\n\nSpeaking of the nonsensical remote music box winding that somehow requires looking at a video feed, there is also a flashlight in this game. You're not just restricted to using it in the office, however. The flashlight can also be used in other rooms to light up dark corners. However, you're still only viewing these rooms on a camera. How can a flashlight light up something you're only viewing on a video feed? Huh? What?\n\nAs for difficulty, this game is even harder than the first, which was not a step in the right direction. The horror also fades much more quickly this time around due to having to go through the same things over and over. There isn't a whole lot of horror in the sequel, so cue falling back on jumpscares harder than ever. Some of the jumpscares are actually pretty good, aside from being overused but then there's laughable ones like Toy Freddy and Toy Bonnie just kinda jumping around being colourful, which is supposed to be scary because a loud noise is playing at the same time.\n\nOne thing I was really looking forward to, even as my opinion on this game got more negative, was unlocking the "custom night." With even more animatronics to choose from than last time, I thought that'd mean even more customisation. Nope. Foxy is locked to being active even on 0. The music box winds down extremely quickly, maybe even faster than it did on night 5, and there's no setting to change this. It might seem silly bringing up an unlockable mode in a serious review but the fact is that the mode got ♥♥♥♥ed up so badly that I feel it deserves a mention. There is the nice addition of presets in the custom mode to try, which reward the player with some cute bonuses, but I'd rather have a custom night that actually feels fully customisable.\n\nI still sort of enjoy the game, to an extent, maybe as a guilty pleasure. It's however very disappointing, and I can't say I got much substantial enjoyment out of it. The next installment in the series is apparently very close to release, so that one's getting rushed out too. I'm kind of wary about buying it. Should that one be a rushed jumpscare fest as well, it may be safe to say that Five Nights at Freddy's was a pretty good horror game that got way out of hand and spawned nothing but bad sequels that don't use any scare tactic other than jumpscares.","February 15, 2015","false","20.5"," 121 of 219 people (55%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","55","121","219","14","10"

You can find most of the stuff from this game on youtube.\n\n\nIf you're interested, just watch some videos of it on youtube.\n\n\nAnd I bet you, most 'fans' of this game, have probably never even played either of these games. They are just fans of the characters (which dosen't make much sense, since there is almost no personality for any robot). I think it could've been MUCH scarier if we were able to see the pizzeria open during the day, to get more of a feel for each character, and see how they normally act.

They are also joined by some upgraded and shiny new versions of the standard four animatronics- Toy Freddy, Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica and Toy Foxy (affectionately known as 'Mangle' due to the absolute state he is in). As if this fiendish lineup of 9 animatronics was not enough, 2 extra and unique animatronics enter the fray- the Balloon Boy, a seemingly harmless yet incredibly dangerous animatronic which messes with your lights, and the Marionette, an unspeakable terror that is quite simply your doom should it ever escape from the container it is kept in.\n\nGameplay Mechanics\n===============\nFreddy likes the dark and now things get even darker. You'll be forced to use the new camera lights in order to see into the darker depths of some of the rooms, but beware the battery meter. You must also keep on turning the jack in the box in order to escape the wrath of the Marionette. Even worse, there are no doors! One must use all of their cunning and alertness to survive the five nights without being completely dismembered by the animatronics. The Freddy Mask can assist with this, as it will fool some of the animatronics into thinking that you are the incredibly psychotic bear himself. Also, beware the new hallunications- will you discover the true story behind this cursed establishment? What is the true role of the Marionette?\n\nConclusion\n========\nI give this game a 9/10. It is truly almost perfect.\n\nPros:\nA larger Freddy Fazbear's Pizza to perish in\nMore animatronics to get destroyed by\nThe unique graphics which give the game its signature feel return\nMore gameplay mechanics to offer a new experience\nA scary experience\n\nCons:\nScott seemed to sacrifice a lot of development time (originally aiming for a 2015 release) in order to get this game out as a 'surprise' early release. Though it is indeed cool that we are able to play the game early, one is left wondering, could this game have been so much more if Scott stuck to the original deadline?","November 11, 2014","true","7.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RottyTopaz/recommended/332800/","RottyTopaz","ShottySnowpaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RottyTopaz/","100 products in account","Its kind of like Night Trap, but rather then teenage girls, there's an anthropomorphic chicken with no pants on.\nWhich can be taken as a negative or a positive, depending on what kind of sick the part of the internet your on is.\n\nIts like the first game, you look at cameras to make sure a bunch of Chuck-E-Cheese animatronics don't touch your butt, but this time, you have a flashlight. Also there's no doors. Thats kind of important too.\n\nThis is what should be a direct sequal to the original Five Nights at Freddy's, but isn't. Its a prequel. And its incriedbly obvious that this idea was thought up half way threw devolpment. The original animatronics from the first games have been dismantled, to make way for a new line of "Super Kid Friendly" Animatronics. So kid friendly infact, that one of the animatronics has booty shorts and boobies.\n\nSince the company doesn't seem to have any idea what doors are, they decided that the should instead have a massive hole right threw the center of the office. Also two air vents that are on the floor for some reason, and also have no grates  on them. And they seem to connect to two of the party rooms for some reason, and they don't have grates over the party room floor vents either. Seriously thats just asking for a kid to crawl in there and die.\n\nAnyway, these new kid friendly animatronics also want to touch your butt. But since you have no doors your only means of defending yourself are putting on a Freddy mask so they think your an animatronic and leave. But putting on this mask requires lightning fast reflexes or they'll realize your not an animatronic and touch your butt regardless. They will eventually make it to the end of your massive hallway, where you have to flash your flashlight off and on at them so they go away, just like anyone would if you flashed a light in their eyes over and over again. So what their method for preventing you from abandoning the security cameras this time? A music box that you have to constantly keep winding up, or Ticklefingers the Clown will pop out and give you the butt-touching of a lifetime.\n\nAlso, after you reach night 2, the old, or "withered" animatronics will get up and want to get in on this butt-touching adventure. They basically do exactly the same thing as the new ones except they are much more active, and just end up replacing the new animatronics in the end. Also rather than being the reason to look at the security cameras, this time the fox animatronic makes you stay off the security cameras, thus stopping you from winding the music box, by standing at the end of the hallway, ignoring the mask entirley, and touching your butt if you ignore him too long. You have to flash him a bunch to get him to go away, kind of like kids at the park.\n\nIn my opinion, this game is much better then the first game, it forces you to rely on quick reflexes and good multitasking skills, which makes for some really fun, really challenging, and really creative gameplay that I really enjoyed, though once again, I didn't find that scary. The game is still plauged with its main problem of not having that much too the gameplay. Once you beat the game, there is no real point to playing it again as it won't be able to do anything new or intresting and you'll just tire of it quickly. The cameras are still as useless as ever, you only ever need to go onto it to wind up the music box, and the amount of time your required to pull the hood down in is a little absurd in later levels.\n\nSo to conclude, It's much better then the first Five Nights at Freddy's but is still plauged by its lack of having much gameplay beyone winding up a music box while a bunch of animals interupt you, and once again, I didn't find it too scary but still fun and intresting.

To tell the truth, I saw Foxy there! Where was my nemesis when I wanna see him on the demo version of this?! Still, musn't moan too much.

These new animantronics are called, Toy Chica, Toy Bonnie, Toy Freddy, Balloon Boy, Mangle and finally the puppet! "I never really liked the puppet...it's always....thinking...." - Phone Guy.\n\nIs the game better/worse?\n\nIf you want more of have a challenge from FNAF 1 then you should really try this. You need to focus on more things such as the music box that you need to wind every so often to keep the Marionette/The Puppet Master away. In FNAF 1 all you really need to focus on was the doors, pirate cove and the blindspots. On the other hand in FNAF 2, you need to focus on the music box, vents, corridors, making sure you put on the mask quick enough.  Sounds easy? It's not.\n\n\nDo you like/hate the game?\n\nFNAF 2 has improved in some areas. The only thing is Scott has slighty rushed this game due to the lots of people begging Scott for it to come out. The game does it justice but not that well as in FNAF 1. I would not say I hate it or I even love it. FNAF 1 has a more creepier feel. The ambience is more creepier then FNAF 2. But if Scott didn't rush FNAF 2 all the negatives would be postive. So I don't hate or love this game, guess you could say I am in the middle. (like)\n\nWhat do you think of the new Animantronics/Do you think it is a Prequel or a Sequel?\n\nThe new animatronics do look nice, very kid and adult friendly. Only if they were like that in the actual game. Toy Chica's dead black eyes will always give someone the nightmares. Toy Freddy is not even that scary. Balloon Boy is just a HUGE PAIN. Mangle is spiderman but instead spiderfox. That basically sums up the new animantronics...Oh did I forget someone....the Marionette? I never talk about him...his always listening...always watching. I personally think FNAF 2 is a prequel since the Phone guy never mentions the Bite of 87. The animantronics are allowed to move around in the day but in FNAF 1 the phone guy said they aren't allowed to move around in the day. I think FNAF 2 is set before FNAF 1 and before the bite of 87.\n\nOverall?\n\nOverall, the game is great fun to play. The first time playing is always the most scariest since you don't know what is going to happen. It's the unknown that scares you. FNAF 2 as I said, could be improved but hey.....Scott is only working all by himself, it's amazing how he can create a game like FNAF 2 in 2-3 months.\n\nI hope FNAF 3 will improve from FNAF 2 and is not rushed. Looking forward to FNAF 3!\n\nThanks for reading my review!","November 11, 2014","true","32.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SUPER-SHAM/recommended/332800/","SUPER-SHAM","rag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SUPER-SHAM/","69 products in account","I must admit I wasn't expecting much going in, considering the first one to me was a big disappointment from what others said it was, and I myself am not much a horror fan, but frankly I haven't played enough of it to find it repeatitive. I can say how it can be, but with how unpredictable some of the animatronics can be, you'll be kept on your toes.\n\nThe point of the game, and I use that word loosely, is to survive 12 AM to 6 AM. You are given a job as a night guard for Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. but there's a big catch. There are animatronics in the restaurant that are out for your ♥♥♥, so it's a defense game in which you have to prevent said animatronics from killing you until 6 Am, in which even if they were on the brink of killing you, you go off free at 6 AM. Why they try to kill you is never explained, but the excuse is that they were never given a night mode, thus they go for where the people are, and that happens to be your office. I wonder if they kill people in other rooms during the day too, because again, why they try and MURDER you instead of sing a nice song to you during the night is never explained, but as the nights go on, through phone communication with an anonymous staff member, you are described horrific events that have went on within the restaurant. As well as that Puppet is his least favorite and Foxy is his favorite! <3~\n\nThe mechanics are simple but fun and make for a challenging and addictive expierence. There's a flashlight, which you should NOT USE FOR THE CAMERAS FOR THE MOST PART. They're only useful for actual cameras on nights 1 & 2, since you don't wanna waste any of your flashlight with how much a certain animatronic appears, and the only way to stop said animatronic is WITH THE FLASH LIGHT. The music box mechanic is pretty much the only reason to use the camera, which is...Disappointing. One of the 'major' game mechanics you never use and only need to use for one room, a similar problem in the first game with pirate cove. Scott Cawthon seriously needs to make a way to make all the cameras more significant other than just holding the animatronics in place for like 3 seconds..Sure, you could say this is pretty useful but I think it's just pathetic, considering this is probably at least what 25% of the game's data is put into. The other cameras. The death minigames are pretty cool..But there's no way to 'win' and some of them are just a chore, not even worthy of being called 'games' when you think about it. I digress, there are 3 places the animatronics can come from. The hallway in front of you, which you can press on your flashlight from within your office to check, as well as two vents on your left and right. How else to defend yourself given they make it into your office- WHICH THEY WILL BY THE WAY - well, you are given a Freddy Fazbear mask you can wear to fool the animatronics into thinking you're one of them!...Well, most of them. I will describe how I feel about the animatronics and their point in the game below.\n\n\nToy Freddy/Freddy Fazbear: I'm talking about the duo of bears that will do more than steal your precious pick-a-nick baskets, starting at the end of the hall to warn you that they're there if you flash your light down. From what I know, unlike Old Bonnie and Old Chica, these two cannot just flash in your office. Although it may be seen as 'easy to avoid' when they have stages of lurking before they actually try to attack you, it seems they catch you at the WORST time, maybe you haven't flashed the flashlight at Foxy, maybe you spent a little to much time waiting to wind up the music box, either way, it'll be these bears' fault.  Essentially, these two are saboteurs that can also kill you if given the chance.\n\nOld Bonnie: This thing is freaking huge for some reason. Seriously, I ♥♥♥♥ my pants just from looking at how big he was the first time he appeared in the office. I don't even know why he's so big, or why specifically the front of his face is missing, but it makes for a frightening and formiddable foe. Similar to how he was in the first game, he appears in front of whenever he wants it seems. Just pop on the mask and if he catches you at the wrong time, similar to almost all of the animatronics, you'll be from loving them to hating them in a few deaths.\n\nNew Bonnie: Why the hell did this guy get so much significance, or like it seems to be the case. He has a special sequence from whenever you avoid him from killing you, he's always the first one to leave to stage, and he has a freaking guitar. Not to mention he's the only one with a full redesign for the second game. I don't know. Maybe I'm just not seeing how special he is, but maybe they should've made Freddy more special?\n\nOld Chica: God this is probably the most unnecessarily complicated designs I've seen in a while, and sure, Scott captured the 'ruined and terrifying' thing perfect but...Something about is just..Too much. Maybe it's the double jaw making it look like it was from Twisted Metal, maybe it's the wires for hands, I don't know. She's just like Bonnie in terms of her behaivor, but unlike Bonnie she seems to never show up in the hallway, making when she appears even more terrifying.\n\nNew Chica: What the ♥♥♥♥ing hell. Wh-Why. Why does she look like she would work at Hooters if given the chance. I REALLY dislike the design, and something tells me it was partially fan/r34 inspired.  She acts just like Toy Bonnie except appears in the left vent with no special sequence, but something about HER design- everything about her design is just...Off for a kid's restaurant or at least compared to the others.\n\nFoxy: This thing will be the bane of your existance and will probably kill you the most. He appears at the end of the hall and if you don't flash the flashlight at him, he kills you on the spot. I don't have the exact intervals in which you have to flash the flashlight, but I'm gonna say roughly 8 seconds. This is why all the other animatronics' appearances are sabotage, even if they don't get you. You're always stressed out by his presence, and to put insult to injury, his jumpscare is probably one of the scariest, given how he literally jumps at you.\n\nMangle: I really ♥♥♥♥ing like this things' design. I don't know why, but those huge creepy crawly things in games I really liked look-wise at least. Anyway, this is probably the most active animatronic in the game, having the ability to appear in your office at 12 AM, thus having the ability to end your game AS IT STARTS. Although it is one of the easier one's to deal with, seeing as it only appears in the right vent and can easily be avoided by you plopping your mask on.\n\nBB (Satan): This thing is Five Night's At Freddy's Teemo (League of Legends) or Pyro (Team Fortress 2) essentially. Everybody hates him. Why? Well, if you let him into your office (Avoided by putting on your Freddy mask for a few seconds whilst he's in the left vent) he disables your flashlight, leading Foxy to brutally murder you. And he appears all the ♥♥♥♥ing time.\n\nPuppet, The Marionette, The Puppo: This thing is the music box. The thing that always leads you to die. And neatless to mention the highly proclaimed scariest robot. But, the easiest to avoid. Just wind up that music box, and you'll keep that hipster satisfied. He gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you take away his music.\n\nGolden Freddy: T-This thing is real now. I don't know his pattern essentially, since sorry to say, I haven't beaten Night 6. BUT I HAVE BEATEN NIGHT OF MISFITS, SO CALM DOWN. His jumpscare is pretty hilarious though, it's like the Batman scene switch thing, having his face just charge towards you, dettached from his body. Nothing really else to say about it.\n\nIn conclusion, I reccomend this game for anybody who can handle the spooks. Thank for readings.\n\nP.S. The only camera you need to check is the one with the puppet.\n\n\n","December 26, 2014","true","13.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles93/recommended/332800/","Paddles93","[TPZ] Cereal Killer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles93/","219 products in account","About The Game:\nFive Nights at Freddy's 2 is a Twitch/Thriller adventure pretty much what you get in the first game you double and increase the difficulty and force the player to face their worst fears from the first game, in Five Nights at Freddy's 2, you're brought right up close and personal with the things you're so afraid of in the first game.\n\nUnlike in Five Nights at Freddy's, the pizzaria has been re-opened and is now "child friendly" and here is where you chose to work, in a safe & family friendly environment right?, ahaha yeah think again. The game spans out exactly the same as the first it's a very simple and very easily playable & basic designed game the mechanics have been slightly changed and tweeked and new enemies have been brought to the table with different behaviours.\n\nWhat you believed to be really simple & safe work turns into one of the most horrific & difficult but 100% worth it times of your life.\n\nThe Story:\nThe story is really simple & i basically explained it above, you're a job seeker who found an ad in the paper about a really easy job being a security guard at Freddy's Fazbears Pizzaria doing the late shift of a night that's a Monday - Friday job with minimal pay (YAY).\n\nThe Gameplay:\nYou're to spend 6 hours a night in your little office doing the night shift at Freddy's Fun Farm as a Security Guard, the premise of the game is very simple, make sure that nobody intrudes into Freddy's during the night while trying to avoid the strange & earily creepy Freddy & his robotic friends as they roam the building during the night.\n\nNot everything is as peachy and friendly of a night time though as you'll soon find out because you're running on a timer during the night as power is scarce & you need to save the power as much as you can so that you can keep an eye on Freddy & his friends as they happen to be quite afraid of new people & tend to... well kill people who aren't familiar to them.\n\nEach night becomes increasingly difficult & not only that but it seems to take longer to complete each night, of course if that's not bad enough then you'll find comfort in the fact that Freddy & his friends become more and more active through the week & require a lot more thorough checking in order to avoid winding up like so many other Secutiry Guards before you.\n\nThis game really relies on you to be 100% alert at all times & not only is hard to do that because you're constantly switching between camera's & checking outside your office doors but Freddy & his friends tend to just randomly screw with you on certain playthroughs by disabling the power of the lights or by disconnecting your cameras, not only do they do that but sometimes they completely obscure the camera vision with their evil smiles or to make things worse sneak into your office & while you're busy watching the camera's feel the need to scare the living ♥♥♥♥ out of you!\n\nEnemies in Five Nights at Freddy's 2 don't always follow the same set path either, enemies will often pop up in different corridors and come from differen't angles as to always keep you alert.\n\nThe Verdict:\nThere are SOOO many good things i can say about this game but i don't have enough characters to type all of these things, and very few faults i can pick at with this game.\n\nAlthough this game is designed solid & it's scares are not those small little "Oh i saw that coming but it still scared me" scares they're truly terrifying when they happen because you never really know when you're going to get caught by Freddy or his friends & whenever you do it's generally off guard they catch you.\n\nThe AI in this game although very simple is Flawless an it always manages to be challenging even if it's so simple & due to the randomization of the gameplay you never experience the same thing over and over.\n\nSometimes the game can feel unfair when you're almost finished and the robots all gather around you in your office, or when Freddy & his friends turn off the power to the lights and leave you in the dark but it never feels 100% cheap it is just the game really screwing with you and tormenting you, wanting you to continue but at the same time showing that you'll never be guarenteed a win even if you're so close.\n\nThe setting in this game although simple is designed perfect to be creepy even if it is a few different static backgrounds quickly slapped together, it's a flawless attempt at making a horror experience and it works 100% without a doubt.\n\nI give this game a 9/10.\n\nAnd i give it this because there's really no flaws in it, it's just designed perfect in every way, The game is meant to be difficult & it achieves that by occasionally putting you in situations of intense thrills & other times you breeze through without even seeing Freddy or his friends\n\nEven though the game is very much the same each time it makes the experience different each playthough so it gives it replay value & then there's the thrill of beating the levels and knowing that you've overcome the odds and made it through to the next day!\n\nDo I Recommend This Game?:\nYes i do recommend this and i suggest that people buy this game because it's so damn cheap and a well worthy experience.\n\nIf you're on the fence about it try playing Five Nights at Freddy's 1 and see if you enjoy it as they're almost the same except with new and improved enemies & a few more hard challenges.\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's 1:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/319510/","November 11, 2014","true","1.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Despite being much more difficult, this game adds to the story. There are many new enemies you must avoid. The vintage animatronics rotting in the back room, the new kid-friendly creeps on stage, the ripped up mess of a skeleton, and this stupid kid holding a balloon. The game is funny (Chica now has panties), ugly (Vintage Bonnie is missing his face), and creepy ("Mangle" plays strange sounds).

A death minigame is pretty nice. You have a flashlight that doesn't run out of power just like the first one and a Freddy mask that keeps you safe which is pretty nice also. There's no doors which is fine by me. That might be it for now.  Like I said, I like it and I really enjoyed playing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/1mirg/recommended/332800/","1mirg","mirg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/1mirg/","170 products in account","the game is still just pictures with 3D models along with some very simple game mechanics. But, the games core is the lore and fear factor. Which has been brought up a notch in comparision to fnaf 1. There are also a total of 6 new animatronics, really upscaling the dificulty factor, possibly too much. But, regardless. The game is enjoyable and entertaining. The only bugs I can find are few but not making the game unplaying. The "freddy head" seems abit overpowering at first. But on night 2 you realise that the head will not save you from all of them. the removal of the generator power bar and replacing it with a flashlight power bar makes alot more sense. Plus, it give you the player more focuse on the animatronics rather than your power bar. Each animatronic seems unique and has there own personality. Like the new Bonnie for example like to play guitar from time to time and loves to take "selfies" with the camera and etc. The removal of doors seems to have made the game harder. But in reality it doesn't. It really just makes the game more immersive. The thing that makes the game harder is all the new animatronics and all the new rooms. In the end, this is a great improvement from fnaf 1 but isn't too radical.

Five Night's at Freddy's quickly come to be one of the biggest names of recent years, and diehard fans were waiting eagerly for a sequel, however Five Nights at Freddy's 2 fails to deliver. Your weapon this time around is a mask, a flashlight, and your trusty security camera. The fatal flaw is the delivery. There are 10+ animatronics to worry about this time around and between shining your flashlight through hallways and air vents and constantly, I mean CONSTANTLY, needing to pull up the camera to wind up a music box I got so stressed I forgot I was supposed to be scared. The original Five Night's at Freddy's created a good balance of suspense, player effort and jumpscares. This game leaves no room for suspense which in turn creates lousy jumpscares. The icing on the cake is the amount of random nonsense that really takes away from the game, making it feel less real. When looking at a room with the camera it's near pitch black, so you need a light to see, but shining a light takes away your flashlight battery? What are you shining your flashlight at the security camera and the camera is acting as a portal? And explain how I "wind up" The Marionette's box while looking through the camera. Is it a bad game? Not neccesarily, but I would only give it a 4/10 and sadly can not recommend it to anyone","June 24, 2015","false","6.4"," 27 of 48 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","27","48","4","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/debray3pootis/recommended/332800/","debray3pootis","Ðɘ ℬᖇдƴ³","http://steamcommunity.com/id/debray3pootis/","11 products in account","THINK BEFORE YOU GET INVOLVED!\nOne of my good friends introduced me to this "game", I wish I never got it though. I have 3 main reasons why I strongly dislike this "game", each of them making more of an impact on me than the last. These are my personal opinions. I have been part of the fanbase at one point, then I saw from the view of the anti-fanbase section. I chose to stick with the anti-fanbase, because I had more evidence to back-up my opinion.  I feel that this game is nothing but a wasted opportunity. All I have to say is, look at both sides of this community, then choose. You can say whatever you want to me, but good luck changing my opinion on this subject.\n\nIf you are going to give this review a negative rating, atleast contact me and tell me what I should fix. If you don't contact me, I am going to assume that whomever said this review was not helpful is biased twords the game. Many people hate people who are biased. I am looking for back-up claims as extra proof to why this game is good or not. I look forward to hearing from some of you guys who are looking for helpful reviews and improve my reviews as much as possible.\n\n3: Gameplay mechanics. When it comes to games, I don't think that graphics matter, but that is not the problem with this "game":. Give what I am about to say a little thought before you start hating on me. It is a point and click game where you have to follow a pattern in order to pass a certian night. That's it. Once you know the pattern the game isn't even fun to play. It's like trying to memorize a combination on a keypad, or the combination on a padlock. Takes you about 60 seconds, then it becomes boring doing it over and over and over again. All you do is sit in a backroom and keep repeating the same process for about 6 minutes. If you somehow don't make it because you mess up on the pattern, the "jumpscares" are nothing more than an animation to show that you died. They're not even scary the first time you see them. Just another way of saying "Game Over". This game could have been on the Nintendo Entertainment System ( An 8-bit gaming console from 1985) and still have worked the same. Not saying that console was bad, but I expect more from todays developers. I would think that kids this generation would be into some newer games, but that apperantly isn't the case. Bloody Disgusting, this game didn't deserve your Game of the Year awards because the awards where for characteristics that the game doesn't even have. The game is not even close to being scary. I expect more from you guys over there at Bloddy Disgusting. I thought you knew what you were doing, but that just simply is not the case.\n\n2: Propaganda and Hype Culture. There is no where to hide from this series. There are videos everywhere on Youtube and Steam. It even has a role in the 2015 Youtube Rewind. Some people are doing good with this reputation such as Markiplier, but the majority is just a bunch of screaming kids, and terrible acting just to get a few subscribers. A majority of the content is not even gameplay. It's a bunch of Source Film Maker content and some "animation". Once peope get involved and you do not think about the negative side of the fanbase, there is no way you're coming back out. You're stuck in a world of mediocre gameplay and animation. If you want to see some of this games content (Why would you?) find some actual gameplay. Or better, play the real game. Or even better yet, ignore this whole series. This game and it's annoying, prepubescent fanbase is not worth anyones time. Please ignore people who try to suck you into playing the game.\n\n1: The fanbase. I don't even know how to start this off. This games fanbase has crippled the gaming community as we have known it. I don't even know what ruined the community more, fans of this game, or the concept of Major League gaming. Both are ignorant, and pitiful ways of getting attention from other people. There are some really good members of the "community", but a majority are a bunch of kids who have know idea what they are even talking about. This games fanbase is worse than the Call of Duty fanbase. I even gave the Call of Duty fanbase a shot and it's not as bad as some people would think. I am not biased twords Call of Duty or Team Fortress 2. I just prefer one over the other. (Team Fortress 2, but they can both be fun). But why would I hate someone just because that like a game that I don't? Or if someone liked this mediocre "horror-game" and came after me because I didn't like it. There are fantastic people in every gaming fanbase. But some fanbases are more corrupted than others. I will be using the Call of Duty fanbase. Keep in mind that these traits can be traced back to TF2 just as easily. There are many screaming 10 year olds trying to prove they are better than everyone else. Sounds bad already doesn't it? Well take the worst, and most annoying kids in Call of Duty and Team Fortress 2 combined. Then compare that to some of the less annoying kids involed with Five Nights at Freddys. I don't know about you guys, but the kids in the first person shooter games look like saints to me. I have another question for you. Why not enjoy the game the way it is other than creating a bunch of unrelated, mediocre fan art and fan fiction? Isn't the point of a fanbase to find people with certian intrests that you could hang out with, talk, and enjoy the game? If you make a few good looking, realistic, relatable pictures, go for it. Just please don't go too far with your work.\n\nAlso, take a look at these comments. Really. Just stop reading this sentance, and read some comments. People who try to back-up this game and prove me wrong are clearly children who have no reasoning behind their statement. If you guys want to represent a game you like, be reasonable. What the Five Nights at Freddy's "fans" are showing me is that if I join this fanbase and enjoy the game for what it is, I will be categorized as a brainwashed 10 year old who doesn't even know how to use a keyboard. Even though I clearly am not that person. Believe it or not, I can type out "You", and "Your". I know not all fans are a bunch of stupid 10 year olds. In fact, some fans of this game I know are actually sensible, empathetic, and all around wholesome people that I enjoy hanging out with.\n\nWhen it comes to the gameplay, this game isn't so bad. I actually enjoyed the game for the first hour or so. I didn't quite know what to expect. After that, I started to play this game for the sake of playing it ironicly. That explains why I played for 10 whole hours. But after that, I came across this Youtube video. This video was called, "I Hate Five Nights at Freddys" by: I Hate Everything. I agreed with a majority of what he had to say, and had the same questions as he did.\n\nThen I saw another video of his called "Comment Comeback: I Hate Five Nights at Freddys". A majority of the comments he talked about that were "going against" his video were clearly from children who had no reasoning behind what they said. If the gaming world had players that were only , (or at least acted) 17 and older, every games fanbase would be worth being part of. But the only draw back is, no petty (trivial) insults and comments to make fun on.\n\nIt's you stupid 10 year olds who have ruined many things for many people. If you are 10 years old and come up with comments like Dipper and Tristan, please leave Steam. Good riddance!\n\nIf you want to go ahead and buy this game, go ahead and try it out. No harm in it. Just don't go around bragging about how good this game is, how good you are at the game, making unrelatable fan art, stories that have no impact on the community, and flooding the Steam and Youtube communities with animations. I don't dislike people who play this game for fun. I dislike people who take it too far.","January 25","false","10.4"," 44 of 81 people (54%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","54","44","81","9","31"

However, after a while it became to predictable and therefore not as scary, making it less enjoyable to play. The only thing that could revive my interest in the game was a sequel. And that is exactly what Five Nights at Freddy's did. Not only did it up the difficulty by doubling the number of animatronics, but it also made the patterns more erratic and less predictable, giving the game longevity. It brought over and intensifed the same feelings that FNaF had given to the player so it is a better scare in general. However, there is another thing that FNaF2 did that FNaF did not: Add depth. In the first game it was simply sit in a Chuck-e-Cheeses and try not to die, but in this game the between nights cinematics, the minigames, the  puppet, and even the phone calls added a layer of story and eerieness absent from the original. It leaves the gamer with questions about the story, and even throws in hints suggesting things that seem impossible (like the puppet being the ringleader of the first game). The last phone calls in the game are especially eerie and that last phone call even has a plot twist which answers questions then raises many others. This mystery floating around the game makes it much more enjoyable to play, making it not only a good scare, but a great game as well.","November 14, 2014","true","1.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The cameras are there to add fear and make tou paranoid. On the 3rd night you just stop using the cameras, you just wind the box. I'm sure so scary stuff happens on the cameras, but I never see it happen. As the animatronics get faster, and same with the music box, the game looses it's appeal. You scream at it out of anger, not fear. Somehow the withered animatronics just run into your room two seconds in.

They all have their own discernible approach patterns, and countering them is just a matter of resource management (your flashlight battery and a music box), and prioritizing which enemies are closest to attacking you.  If you mess up, there's a loud noise and a brief attack animation.\n\nYou have access to a camera monitor with feeds running throughout the facility, but there's never a reason to look at any feeds other than the prize room, which is where you have to go to wind the music box.  Each night lasts only a few minutes, so there's not really any time to build tension or suspense.  The animatronics don't actually move either (apart from the attack animations) - they just teleport from location to location, appearing in pre-set poses.\n\nThe game's atmosphere is creepy for about 10-15 minutes before the pattern of the game becomes tedious and boring.  The game is irritating and not scary at all.\n\nEdit/Update: If you're wondering what kind of people enjoy this game, check out the comments on this review.","May 17, 2015","false","1.6"," 38 of 70 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","38","70","3","5"

FNAF 2 is probably the best one out of the 2 games. Some of the questions that people have before getting the game is how do you run out of power now? In FNAF 2, the building no longer runs out of power. So you are able to use the cameras and air vent lights as much as you want. But the thing that DOES run out of power is your flashlight. You are able to use your flashlight to check down the hallway in front of you or by using it while in the cameras to light up whichever room you are looking in. The flashlight is the most important part of the game because of the fact that it helps rid of unwanted animatronics coming down the hall and also shows where the characters are in the rooms since most of the rooms are pretty much black. Moving on. This game is very addicting and easily deserves a 10/10. The main hardest thing about the game is how active the animatronics are right off the bat and the fact that you have to keep a music box winded up. On night 1, Toy Bonnie and Toy Chica come out and are very aggresive right from the start which makes the game very hard straight from the beginning. Many times Toy Freddy will also come out on the 1st night making you have to deal with 3 animatronics right from the start. Also, there is a Marionette. This "doll" hides in a present on Cam 11. This is also where there is a music box you have to wind up almost every couple seconds. By winding up the box, it will keep the Marionette from coming out of hiding and killing you. All together, it is a very tough game having to deal with 11 animatronics, yes you heard me 11. The old gang from FNAF 1 is back and ready to kill :). There is also the Marionette and YES THERE IS GOLDEN FREDDY. Sorry if I am not exactly correct on the amount of animatronics but either way there are a lot. There is also Balloon Boy which is another animatronic you will have to find out about yourself :). In conclusion, FNAF 2 is an amazing and very unique game. I recommend it 10/10 and advise you to buy it! Have fun playing guys! I know I did!","November 11, 2014","true","4.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Although still true to its genre, the game tasks you with too much to do on one night. For instance, you have to check the hallway in front of you, both vents on the sides of the room, your cameras and make sure to wind up the music box all while trying not to get killed by one of the ten animotronics roaming around the buildng. The game is also too challenging. It is very difficult to be able to put your mask down over your face when an animotronic pops up, forcing your camera down.

Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is an amazing sequeal to FNaF 1, there is alot of cool easter eggs and characters/animatronics in this game. It's way more challenging than the first FNaF, espeacially the 20/10 mode on this game (IT'S INSANLEY HARD!!) The game also reveals more of the story to the FNaF series, leaving more questions behind. The jumpscares in here are not that scary in my opinion, there a little unexpected and scary through the first two nights, but after that it kinda repeats itself. All in all, FNaF 2 was a pretty good game, not my favorite FNaF game, but really fun to play! The mechanics are really creative and love every bit about them!!

MINOR GAMEPLAY SPOILERS!!!\n\nA fantastically amazing sequel to the first game which scared the ♥♥♥♥ outta me! 12 animatronics each with their own AI and ways to get rid of them (and not be killed by them). FNaF 2 is hard and when I say hard I mean hard! I feel like I'm Vishnu! Having many pairs of arms and having to do SO MANY THINGS AT ONCE!!!\n\nHowever it is scary but not as tense as the last one, the problem is with FNaF 2 is that the animatronics constantly come at you, rather than a build up to the actual scare in the original, at first the jumpscares can be extremely predictable and after a while the jumpscares are just plain annoying rather than scary!\n\nNew Mechanics...\n\nTHE FREDDY HEAD\n\nYou have to do a lot to stay alive in FNaF 2, you have a new Freddy helmet mechanic where when an animatronic enters the room you have to hide being it in order to 'trick' the animatronics so it simply replaces the doors. But this is flawed in a way. While the head does provide some immersion and you can’t use the cameras or the new flashlight (I will get to that later) when the withered animatronics enter the room (The ones seen in the trailer) it’s extremely unfair towards the player, if you are 0.000000001 milliseconds early in taking the head off they will kill you without a chance and a frustrating robotic scream and one huge gaping mouth in your face to see you off to your static-screen doom!\n\nTHE FLASHLIGHT AND THE HALLWAY\n\nThis was one of the mechanics I liked the ability to light a black abyss (One huge dark hallway) in front of you to illuminate the hidden animatronics chillin' in the hallway. Foxy plays a huge role in the flashlight mechanic where as if you don’t "flash your light at him from time to time" he will jump in your face! However you don’t need to worry too much as he goes away after a while (and comes back every now and then). To replace the power usage from the original game you have flashlight battery, you are given 4 bars (5 counting the outline) using the flashlight too much will drain power from it, drain all of your power (or a certain little ♥♥♥♥♥ of an animatronic getting into your office!) then foxy or Freddy can get you!\n\nSummary...\n\nFNaF 2 is harder than the first but less scary I found, don’t get me wrong this is break your chair scary! But the original had a more eerie ambience and scarier events (I'm never going to forget the first time I saw an "ITS ME" hallucination or all the animatronics’ parts staring at me in the repair room!)\n\nYouTube Playlist Here of all of my playthroughs!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGJwwW3BiEw80AxE56OCZVMxNgjPK9jiR","November 19, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's jump scares gets old though, I get tired of it really.\n\nSPOILER ALERT, DO NOT CONTINUE READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT SPOILERS\n\n\n\n\nIf you are reading this Scott, I do have a puzzling question that may sound insane to many and embarrassing if I've been thinking too deep about it and I'm really not wanting to ask anyone else but you, I've recently taken a look at the picture of the "Bad Ending" in the 3rd game, and I looked at the fifth head (the one at the back) and it reminded me of something I saw somewhere in one of these 4 games, and I suddenly remembered it from the first game, you know the flashing animatronic that plays the music when your power goes out? It resembled it so much! I always thought it was Freddy though...so here's my question...am I correct to say that the animatronic flashing is not Freddy?...I mean...many say that the fifth head is golden Freddy and just leaves it as that, but I see a big similarity between the first game's flashing head and this glowing head which if my theory is correct, it is impossible for it to be Golden Freddy...Or is it just Freddy in the first game as it wasn't drawn properly...?","May 31","true","2.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When I played the first game for the first time,   I could only stand playing 1 night at a time, then I finished that game. But when 2 came out I just had to buy it. I played it and I still could barely play it. When I got to night four, I failed  ALOT. After Playing night 4 for about 40 minutes, it didn't really seem scary anymore. Foxy was always in your hallway, toy bonnie was always in your vent. Mangle was always near you, and cheeca showed up a lot too. Even though you can get used to this game's scariness, I still play it because of how deep the story goes. Even though I'm sure there are millions of theories, I dont really believe them. The reason for theat is that Scott Cawthon left sooooo many questions un-answered, so many easter eggs, it kept people playing. And that is why I loooove this game so much because of all of the secrets within. I definitly recomend playing either the first or second game. They both have so many un-answered questions, keeping the minds of people thinking.","January 3, 2015","true","4.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Very wrong. It's from the same recipe book, but it's a very different gumbo of terror. There's much more to do and juggle around, and the rather naked feeling of having no doors this time really adds to the fear factor. No draining power this time, except for your flashlight which you can use in your office and on the camera feed (somehow - we're not bothered about how that works). The 30's cartoon-eque new gang are quite disturbing and there are some other new friends I didn't expect at all. It feels very polished and tightly coded, no 'rushed' feel to it as I was fearing. Scott really has a great understanding of how to make simple things scary. If you were a fan of the first game, you'll love this one even more.","November 11, 2014","true","2.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game makes the original look like it was made in a day. Scot, please carry on the masterpiece that is this game. Even if its not FNAF just make more scot. Make more games that include child friendly and child loved things and turn them into things that will haunt the nightmares of the innocent people. Ill be buying a copy for a friend tomorrow.

Once again you are the security gaurd at the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, surviving the night from the animatronics, and barely getting enough money to buy something useful. This time you only have a secuirty camera, a flashlight, and a freddy fazbear mask to fool most of the animatronics, as well as winding up a music box to keep one animatronic at bay. Now unlike the first game which only had 4 Animatronics (5 if you count Golden Freddy) This one has 10 (11 if counting Golden Freddy) so even with the freddy head and flashlight the game is much harder than the first game. I mostly recomend this for hard core gamers.","June 12, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

What I mean by this is that you are supposed to keep track of where your enemies are at all times by checking each room through the cameras while frequently winding the music box and protecting yourself with the mask... in theory. In practice, however, it inevitably breaks down into this formula:\n\nNight 1: You get attacked once, maybe twice by only 1 enemy (Bonnie 2.0, who moves very slowly and very predictably), not counting the Marionette. Cakewalk.\n\nNight 2: Optimized difficulty. You have to balance the music box, your immediate surroundings, and your distant surroundings to fend off all the anamatronics. Foxy and the Marionette will murder the ♥♥♥♥ out of you if you neglect the music box or the hallway lights.\n\nNights 3-6: There is so much ♥♥♥♥ going on, you're basically only checking and responding to the immediate areas around the office while sparing the 5 seconds you have between encounters to wind the music box. If you spend ANY time searching for the anamatronics outside of the vents or the front hallway, you are wasting your time and WILL die, considering that there are now 11 of the ♥♥♥♥ers out for your flesh instead of the first game's 5 - and that at ANY given time ONE of them WILL be poking their head into your office if they're not already right in front of you.\n\nFor the latter 2/3rds of the game, all it is (in it's current state, as of this review,) is just spamming lights, lights, lights, mask, music box, mask, lights, and lights and lights. Do it fast enough, you win. Stagger your pace, Freddy ♥♥♥♥s your face.\n\n...still, the game is such a novelty, I can't NOT recommend it.","November 13, 2014","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

New animatronics, new parts to the story and everything! I discovered FNAF 1 and 2 at around the same time so I still wached lets-plays of it.  (SPOILERish ALERT comic up!) The fact that there was no doors and much more animatrionics made it challenging (in a good way). I found the toy animtronics really creepy but really cute/cool at the same time. The jumpscare where still scary and amazing, so if you HATE getting jumpscared then then this game MIGHT not be theone for you. -thank you for reading my review!\n\nthnk you for yet another amazing game Scott Cawthon. :)\n\nFNAF 2 (C) Scott Cawthon/Games\n\n\n","January 30, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jandgames/recommended/332800/","jandgames","meh_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jandgames/","40 products in account","This is a great sequel to a game that deserved so much attention.\n\nThe atmospheric sounds in this game creates more tension and suspense.\n\nScott did a fantastic job on this game, in only 2 months, not like any other highly anticipated game. This game was made in 2 months. This Five Nights At Freddy's has new and unique mechanics with the new music box that awakens something you don't want to meet. And the new mask creates more scares and suspese.\n\nYou can tell if there's going to be a jumpscare in the first game. With the whining noise that the animatronics make, but now it's harder to tell if you'll die. With some random chance when you put on the mask starting on Night 3.\n\nBalloon Boy makes things much more interesting with him cutting out the lights. This game makes people who can multi-task look stupid. This game takes so much thought. Or none. But it's a good cheap game for playing if you're bored or want to do some let's play.\n\nPROS\n- New Music Box Mechanic\n- New Mask Element\n- New Flashlight\n- More animatronics\n- Old animatronics reintroduced\n- No doors (creating challenges)\n- Presets in Custom Night Menu\n- Rewards for completing preset nights.\n- Runs well on most systems\n- Unique mini-games creating more questions and theories\n- LOTS and LOTS of Easter Eggs (and scary ones)\n\nCONS\n- Sometimes can get too hard for some players.\n- Only runs on Windows, and not Mac or Linux.\n\nOVERALL:\n\n84/100\n\nThis is my honest opinion.

This game provides a nice challenge and isn't super easy like the 1st game, balls to the walls difficult as the 3rd game or super sound required like the 4th game requiring you to wear headphones at full volume, making you extremely susceptible to being deafened by the jumpscares. Despite the 10x20 mode being the hardest in the series and the music box can and will be the death of you multiple times, for only $7.99, it is worth a purchase if you are into the Horror Survival Genre.

Think again, this one may be a prequel but it's even scarier than the first game and the worst part is, there are no doors. Luckily you have a Freddy Fazbear Head so if you can use the Flashlight and the head as a team while winding the music box to prevent a certain animatronic from coming out of its box, you should be able to survive the first 3 nights before it starts to get really difficult. If you're a fan of the series, I recommend getting this. The nights are a bit shorter than the first game's, but don't get comfortable with that fact. Since there are no doors, you can't just sit idly by to easily survive Nights 1 and 2, you have to actually start reacting accordingly or you'll end up jumping out of your seat by an unexpected jumpscare.","April 18, 2015","true","64.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Your father, who's name you never took to learning, calls you every day to warn you about where the Pizza pops are, and how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a life you have.\n\n- Your friend who has a fetish for pirates has ADHD and loves to jump at you, make sure not to feed him sugar.\n- The siblings, ♥♥♥♥♥ica, and Bernie, (the new ones) love shoving themselves in small areas, such as the two cubby holes in the side of your room.\n- Freddy, old and new, hate you very much, and never give you time to react to their surprise "smack cams." Make sure to give them a little bit of extra hate.\n-Old ♥♥♥♥♥ica, and Bernie are some of the worst people ever. They will never leave you alone, for they love you so much.\n- Mingle Dingle, your crippled friend, somehow manages to move around your house using his mangled limbs from when he was eaten by savage children.\n- Maria, the puppet, is a shy person, but if you DARE TURN THAT MUSIC BOX OFF? PREPARE FOR A WORLD OF HURT, CAUSE HERE COMES MARIA.\n\nAll and all, a nice, calming, smooth life simulator.

Maybe a little, but it's more about the Fnaf community that rose from it.\n..... I can't describe what has the community turned into, and it's saddening to even watch or listen to. 'Cause alot of you people I've seen have been just acting so bat ♥♥♥♥ crazy over Fnaf, and you only like FNAF related things, and because of people like you are breaking down possible youtube celebrities, our next generation of youtubers going down the drain...\nIt's saddening to see how they are crumbling down because of YOU, but you don't care, do you? You just care about Fnaf's overly done observations, you're like children trying to find out the way to solve a rubix cube and how it's made.\n\nI've seen enough from this community to just seperate myself from it. Sorry, but not sorry to say that I hope the Fnaf community falls faster like the original o.W.n did for the toxicity of people just over doing it. And I hope that Fnaf the game itself dies with the community..... Oh wait, it already has, and I hope it won't rise from the rot again.\n\nThe game was good while it lasted, but I'm just tired of it's existance.\n\n\n\nGo ahead and yell at me, scream at me, send me your hate mail if you're one of those people who disagree blindly.

The mechanic of putting the mask on is not fun it can lead to what feel like some cheep deaths, it feels like it is a fifty/fifty chance you will actually survive. If your playing this game for the horror aspect, don't. This game is not scary in the slightest. This is the worst game in the series.\n\nThis game is also frustratingly overwhelming, take the first game for example. on the first night, you have to worry about Bonnie and Chica, two. Then night two introduces Foxy, now three. Then Freddy enters joins the gang leaving us with four animatronics. But in Five Nights two we start of against Toys Freddy, Bonnie, and Chica, already at three. Then they add three more, Mangle, W. Foxy, and Balloon Boy, now six on the second night, that's more than in the first game even if you count Golden Freddy. I also didn’t count the Marionette that is always there, always watching. Yes, if a game is difficult it doesn’t mean it is bad, but if a game is frustratingly difficult then it is another thing. I can count the number of times I died and there was almost no way I could have stopped it.\n\nWhile the first one was scary and the third had some interesting mechanics this one is just a mess. I spent hours on night 6 and when I finaly beat it, I was kind of disappointed.  I have beaten all custom nights and it really wasn't worth it. I only beat night 7 by cheating, I you place your mouse on freddy's nose then hold C and D then press the plus on the number pad. You will then advance the the victory screen. This game has a lot of custom plushies but they are super hard to get, unless you have help. The theory is that is was a way to test out AI on later nights so scott could skip. I don't know what this has to do with anything, I just think this is a cool trick left over from game development.\n\nHonestly the FNAF series which started off simple has spun out of control with an insane fanbase that acts like this series is the best thing since super mario. I have one question to pose to all that read this review, is this series really worth all the praise it has been getting? Oh and I think is game is over priced, when I first saw a the first game I thought it was a freeware inde game. when I found out it had a price tag I was confused. onestly I wish all the Five Nights games were free, the only reason I am hard on this game is because it is the not as good sequel the the first, and I cost three dollars more!","June 29, 2015","false","5.6"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","18","34","4","5"

First one is how the music box keeps on going even if the winding meter is completely empty. The other one I saw was in the parts/service room. You can see Chica in the dark, if she/he (IDK what the old one is), goes away. You won't see her when you turn on the flashlight, but once you turn it off, you can see the silhoutte. I miss the robot voices and random glitches flashing on screen though.

Also the new Chica loses her beak when she roams and attacks for some reason. I don't know if this is a glitch or intended. That's a bit interesting and maybe a couple of theories can explain it. Other than that, the atmosphere is somewhat similar which may disappoint some players who previously played the first game but it still does bring in the scares. New patterns, new animatronics, new methods, and new easter eggs too! Compared to the first, this is somewhat more challenging since there's a new "defense mechanism" which is a mask and is somewhat effective but only for a couple of animatronics. You'll know more as the night progresses.\n\ntl;dr It's new, fun, challenging, and it may open up new theories about the story of Five Nights at Freddy's. I definitely recommend you buy this game because to me, it's more than just jump scares.","November 11, 2014","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CountDerpy/recommended/332800/","CountDerpy","CountDerpy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CountDerpy/","52 products in account","The game could be better. The original horror aspect is lessened by the threat of power (Which in this game means Foxy is going to get you, but others can be avoided easily.) The puppet is more of a pain in the rear than anything. It does give you more of a jump the first time the music box runs out, or the first few times that old Bonnie or Chica appear when you put the camera down, but after that there is a decrease in the scare factor. I have made it all the way to night 3 so far without dying, but the game was already as challenging as night 3-4 of the original. I wish there would have been more of a haunting atmosphere, which I will admit is hard to pull off with this being a (SPOILER ALERT) prequel. I still want to know what is up with Toy Chica losing her beak when she moves around, makes her look more like a round faced Pikachu than anything, but it is still creepy when you see it. There are some glitches in the game, such as Foxy jumping out from the walls when your not looking directly down the hallway, or him popping out of your camera from time to time. These really need to be fixed, maybe by having a slightly longer cut scene for it where it forces you to look down the hallway. It wouldn't hurt as well to give the animatronics some slightly different death animation and attack screams. Just like at Chuck E. Cheese, the animatronics each have different voices so that needs to be brought out more. That's why it was hard to tell in the first game whether Bonnie was a boy or a girl at first glance. And don't even get me started on BB.\n\nOverall, the scares are still there and are hightened by the ammount of things that are going on, the number of animatronics, and the new mechanics. The only issue is that gameplay is interupted by the music box mechanic, but it redeems itself by adding time constrainted suspence. Do you go for the music box or make sure that Foxy doesn't jump you?\n\n\nMechanics -8/10\nScares - 8/10\nGameplay - 9/10\nDesign - 10/10\nChallenge - Very Challenging if you do not have a good strategy\nRage - Minor Raging early on, but get over it.\nGlitch Fixes - Foxy coming from walls and cameras, Toy Chica's beak dissapearing(?)\n\nOverall - 8.5/10\n\nI Highly Recommend this game and I hope you all enjoy it.\n\nIF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THE ORIGINAL, GO PLAY THAT ONE FIRST\nI RECOMMEND PLAYING THE DEMO VERSION FIRST BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY (Night 1 and 2 on demo)","November 14, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, this time around, the experience is far from what you remember from the original.\n\nNo doors to hide behind. The Animatronics you know and fear will be up and close with you, wandering in and out of your Office sanctuary. Your only defense? An empty Freddy Fazbear head and quick reflexes.\n\nThis time around, more of the grim story behind the Animatronics and the Pizzeria is revealed and the terror-factor of the game is ramped up a great deal more than the previous game. The traditional five night story is back again, along with the bonus Sixth Night, which also factors into the story, unlike the first game.\n\nOne other unique addition is the multiple challenges of the Seventh Night, each one granting an aesthetic reward upon completion.\n\nAll in all, this game is still worthy of the title of "Scariest Game Ever" and has once again proven that this series and developer Scott Cawthon are ones to watch in the future. Easily worthy of a 9/10.
