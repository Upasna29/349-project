I enjoyed the mobile game until the developer got greedy and turned it into a pay to win game, I played some of the older NSS PC games and found them to be challenging but fun...\n\nThis version feels lifeless, a grind against a ruthless manager and players that have as much vision as a 15 year old labrador with cataracts.  As a player you feel like you're a golf cart with the slow turning speed and wide turning circle.  You can use your ability to read the game to make through balls which can set your team up with a scoring chance and possibly even praise from your manager.  This is something that your fellow teammates  cannot do, when you call for the ball they go straight to your feet, since this isn't immediate in some cases you have to turn yourself (golf cart) back into the position you were in and by that time the play is dead and in most cases the ball is lost, all your fault\n\nI'm sure with more play I'd adapt to the way the game wants me to play it, but in a world of FIFA and PES there is no room for such amateur gameplay\n\nThe energy issue is a common problem in modern NSS games.  I lost 40% of my energy on a plane journey to east Europe as part of Europa League game; did I walk?  was I pulling the bus?  So you buy NRG (oops.. stomach cramps!) and it gives you barely enough energy to last an entire game; if you come on as a sub you get barely enough time to get into the game, try to crank the game time up and you get asked to become a premium member\n\nThe developer has fallen far from grace, once a beloved indie developer turned cash hungry EA type wannabe who clearly no longer cares about the PC fan base that gave them their fame","October 15, 2014","false","0.9"," 41 of 50 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","41","50","5","0"

The match gameplay is reminiscent of Sensible Soccer and other early 90's, and definitely works in a retro kind of way. The resource managing outside of matches helps build the game into a slightly larger, funner experience. All in all, NSS5 is a charming game that promises a few hours of fun.\n\nThe drawback, however, is that the game is kind of a poorly designed, buggy mess. Save files get corrupted left and right, the game freezes with alarming regularity, and the puzzling online requirement tends to make starting new games a chore (hot tip: If you happen to buy it and struggle starting a game because of connectivity issues, edit the Settings\Settings.txt file. Change the line nettimeout=5 to nettimeout=100).\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend it.

Day by day you can practise, buy toys, go out with the girlfriend (if you have one), try to build up a rapport with your team mates, fans, or boss, etc. Initially the main thing is to build the skills and you do training drills where you have to bend the ball, beat defenders, tackle, dribble around cones, etc. in a limited amount of time/attempts, if you do your skills when you play games improve in the appropriate area.\n\nIn terms of playing matches you start off as a sub only having a few minutes, and maybe not being picked at all. Based on doing well in various in game stats you try to get good game ratings, which will get you picked more often, or even a starting position in the team if you keep doing well. At this point you start to having to manage your energy by buying toys to keep you occupied during matches, NRG drinks (which often give you cramps during a game), etc. You also need to spend energy managing relationships if you want your teammates to pass to you, your girlfriend not to dump you, your friends not to hate you, etc. So you get into a balancing act of all these things, and you have to learn how to play the minigame puzzles (pair matching for relationships, "simon says" for the media), etc.\n\nThe main in game challenge isn't really about winning matches, once you know the AIs weaknesses this is fairly easy (for example the quick turn to lure defenders into sliding tackles to clear the way, the banana dribble close to the goalie to lure him out and then walk the ball into the net, the direct vertical run outside the goal to curl into the same side top corner, the diagonal curling out/in balls, etc.). The problem instead is trying to use the match to improve your ranking and stats - so doing lots of safe passing in your own half to build up teammate approval without spending energy, getting some tackles in without getting cards, and otherwise building up your stats for passing/tackles/set pieces to increase your transfer value and wages higher, etc., as the benefit from just scoring more and more goals and winning games is capped - you have to become more rounded to be the best.\n\nOverall the game is quite good fun at times, although it can be frustrating as well, and your team mates need a lot of managing/adaptation to actually be useful to you given how braindead they are, and the out of match stuff makes for a reasonably interesting balancing act. Once you are successful it does all become fairly formulaic however, as once you are fully skilled up and have largely capped out your relationships it is relatively easy to deal with any new off the field problems, and winning matches/championshops/cups is a breeze once you have the skills and know the AIs strengths and weaknesses. I am not sure I would recommend it to most people however at full price, as I doubt most will play it for long enough to really justify the price tag, and apparently it hasn't been on sale for over a year at this point, but this could be a fun game if you like the idea (and have a controller!) and can put up with some bugs/flaws.","December 29, 2015","false","241.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

After following the tutorial, the player can join in matches against the AI teams. During matches, the player can be penalized and even injured preventing them from playing in the next few matches. After the matches are completed, the player gains funds and can gain/lose reputation among various factions e.g. boss, team, friends, etc.\n\nIf the player is not favorable among factions, there is usually some form of consequence on the player, such as a lower "happiness rating", which affects their character's playing performance. The player may participate in mix-and-match mini-games to boost the reputation of factions.\n\nThe player may spend their funds in the shop on various items. The vast majority of the items contribute to "lifestyle rating" which aids in finding a girlfriend, which drastically increases the "happiness rating" of the character.\n\nThe player may also participate in training to boost the character's stats, which helps in their overall performance during matches.\n\nOne of the most amusing aspects of New Star Soccer 5 is the Leader Board. From the Leader Board, you can see your global ranking compared to other players. This makes things competitive, as you can strive to be the #1 player of New Star Soccer 5, globally.\n\nSummary:New Star Soccer 5 is a simple, mildly entertaining game with various features. I recommend this game, but I advise you to try out the free version that is available on the website first. This will allow you to see if $15 is a good value for being able to play the game infinitely each day.","February 1","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sensible Soccer gameplay was great compared to Kick Off 2 since KO2 was too fast for my taste. (Hint: Teenagers and Fifa era players stay away, you wont get the fun of it.)\n+ Gameplay (Rpg/Sim): Transferring yourself, training stuff, buying things and managing personal life adds a great flavour to the game.\n+ Art: Actual matches looks too similar to Sensible World of Soccer with great animation, crowd and weather effect add-on.\n\nCons:\n- Sound: Music is bad. Sfx does its part on matches but could have been far better.\n- DRM system: Signing on to a server (which fails to connect most of the time) is not a good idea (PS: You dont have to be signed in to play).\n- Needs more improvement and rpg flavour (maybe NSS6?)\n\nFinal verdict:\nI've spent many fun hours with the game. It was nice remembering my teenage years which wasted on soccer games :) NSS needs its next installment.

Your starting team determines your starting skill and wage, your skill can be improved by doing training sessions that range from boring to infuriatingly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥zzle. When not training or playing you are either improving relationships with people you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about so that you don't become depressed, drinking when you do become depressed, or failing to get girlfriends because they dont like your lifestyle. This part of the game hits close to home and makes me cry.\n\nWhen you do get big money you can use it to buy stuff to impress women and buy PEDs which make you a better player, you can also abuse sponsorship deals for stat increasing boots and other gear. When you level up and start scoring for fun you can then demand funny money to spend on more pointless stuff that no-one would ever buy. Oh a gold chain for £2000? I forgot it was 1988 and I was Slick Rick.\n\nThe game has some always online feature that allows you to play with other players' avatars in matches which despite the fact that I play for a 4th division Scottish team always seems to be 6'8" black guys named Devarious Le'shintrella. The servers are also complete ♥♥♥ and break all the time meaning that you just play against AI characters instead.\n\nGame is fairly fun but the fact that I always wanted to be a footballer and have a girlfriend mean that playing this game makes me self-harm and drink a lot of alcohol in real life whilst I force my player to be an alcoholic too because I never got to be a footballer and don't have a girlfriend.\n\nDon't play if you're depressed.\n\nP.s. if you're reading this and a girl pls add me on steam I promise to send gifts <3","September 27, 2014","true","14.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","4","6","4","0"

The reality has been implemented via several things such as losing energy while going to play away, not ignoring the girlfriend, making the papers due to sensational events, earning from horse-racing more than football/soccer. So it has a pretty comprehensive content.\n\nIn the game, there are also some events irrelevant to reality like the Premier League championship of a team that have actually never been in the top places of the league, the quarter-finals of UEFA Champions League's including at least one team that actually join to the earlier qualification rounds of the tournament, German National Team's scarcely qualifying out of the qualifications for UEFA European Championship and FIFA World Cup...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/212780/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","Upon first impressions of the screenshots, it's fair to assume that New Star Soccer 5 would be a modern, hopefully deeper attempt at the 90s Sensible Soccer games. Besides the appearance of the match engine, I feel that this game should not be compared to any Sensible Soccer game. New Star Soccer 5 simply does not deliver the same quality of gameplay and overall polish as the 90s favorites.\n\nIn this game, there is much focus placed on the life of the athlete you play as. You will be able to choose which skills to train in, you will be able to take part in social activities with friends, teammates, and a girlfriend. You will have the chance to build your relationship with your manager and the fans, and you will also be allowed to spend money on many items and properties. Most of the time, the way you must perform these actions is by playing memory games where cards will be flashed with different images on them, then they will then be flipped over and and scrambled, and you will need to match two of a kind. That's all there is to it, and it isn't any fun.\n\nThe developer chose to implement a DRM-like system of player creation and in-game updates where you must manually create an account with a password on their servers, and every single time the game updates after a match, for example, it tries to connect again to their servers. The problem is that the connection to their servers fails almost every single time the game tries to reach them to save your progress. This means that you will need to retry the connection over and over, until it works, each time the game fails to connect to their servers, and it happens extremely often.\n\nThe career mode allows for the player to go through a maximum of 20 in-game years, and after that you will need to retire that player and begin a new career with someone new. With your player, you will go through his early development as a teenager all the way to a veteran in his late 30s. There is a simple contract negotiation between you and the clubs, there are transfers, there are relegations and promotions within the leagues, and there are international competitions for both club and country. There are some major flaws with all of these features. Very little of what goes on both in the player's career and on the pitch actually makes any sense. Match ratings are almost totally broken, with the game giving your player a low rating or a high rating apparently not reflecting anything that occurred on the pitch. Your 17 year old player will become club captain and be called up to the national team for doing nearly nothing. It's as if these events were scripted into the programming of the game no matter what you did as a player or how well you played the matches. How well your club performs in cups and championships seems to be artificially altered by more scripted programming, having nothing to do with how well you play or even if you play in the matches at all. Choosing to skip a match and not playing in it makes no difference at all in what happens in the game world or how well your club performs. If the programming of the game wants your club to win or wants you to have whatever random rating, that's exactly what will happen.\n\nThe way the match engine looks is what drew my attention to this game, and coming from playing the Sensible Soccer games in the 90s, I was hopeful to relive a modern take on those games. I was very disappointed. The match engine has many problems, including those related to your teammates' and opponents' AI. Everything seems scripted and the other players on the pitch will not do more than precisely what they were programmed to do. Asking them to pass you the ball can produce some senseless and ridiculous moments. Every match played is almost identical to the last, and can be won by using the same exact strategy as before. The controls are imprecise and can be frustrating at times. The shooting and passing mechanics perform inadequately and rarely the way you intend. It's also really obvious that the game is intended to be experienced by people playing primarily as strikers, and secondarily as attacking midfielders. Every other position won't make any sense at all. If you want to be part of the action on the pitch, you will need to travel the entire field and play out of position almost always. Even as a striker and as an attacking midfielder, if you actually want to be part of the match, you will need to run all over the place and play out of position a lot of the time. In addition to New Star Soccer 5 having all these problems and looking and feeling like a mobile game, it's just not any fun. There are rarely any moments where your actions will mean actual accomplishments, as the game is playing itself down to all the events it has been scripted to do.\n\nNew Star Soccer 5 is mediocre.","February 17, 2015","false","23.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The bad consists in silly puzzles, loosing "fame" even if you had 5 assists in a match and you can only get a girlfriend if you have a certain amount of money. Training also seems a bit off in terms of difficulty, some too easy and others too hard. Prices on players are also non comprehensible.\n\nHowever I did buy this game to play the core of the game and see my youngster rise to the stars, that I have done. He is now at Swansea, has won the world cup for Denmark and is world wide known, everyone wants him but his pricetag is lower than the average premier league footballer, much lower. That did not stop me from buying a joypad and enjoying playing a lot, you control a single player on the pitch and after a few trials I got the hang of it, its fun to score and assist while the coach never seems happy insulting you on every turn.\n\nIn the rise of ranks I started at the Conference North with Histon... then proceeded to Dag&Red, Exeter and then Swansea. I am mainly enjoying playing the matchesand looking at the statistics, something which also has kept me playing. I can look at my history and check a lot of stuff which I have done in the past.\n\nThe rest of the game is mediocre at best, some of the stuff seems made for 6 year old kids hence many bad reviews. The price should be a bit lower, around the 5 euro mark, as it is now its a bit too expensive but I would still recommend just for the core play.

Definitely do not recommend this game, but if you can look past the horrible connection issues, it should provide some fun for a little while.","May 12, 2014","false","30.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Some of the minigames are fun for a while, and the general idea of trying to balance training, games, social life, and other responsibilities in a professional football career is a good one, but ultimately repetitive implementation, odd choice for some mini-games (a higher/lower card guessing game for contract negotiations?) and a match engine 25 years out of date (Sensible Soccer is relatively state-of-the-art) let down what could have been a deep, feature-rich professional footballer career simulator. Still fun for a time due to some fantastic ideas (online leaderboards without demanding direct PvP? Yes, please!), and a series I'd love to see progress, but this edition is simply too basic, particularly during matches which quickly become an exercise in frustration. Worth a playthrough after picking up on the very cheap, but it has a long way to go to be more than just a collection of good ideas.","July 31, 2014","false","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Now the game allows you to run around throughout the entire game, which in theory sounds good but it's really poor.\nYou call for a pass whilst running and your teammates pass behind you then you get the blame for calling for the pass poorly when in reality you're teammate is to blame for the hideous pass.\nTrying to head the ball is abysmal too.\nOnce you get the ball, you can go on a lot of dribbles and play some nice passes in to your teammates but it's very difficult to tackle opponents and because your teammates can barely pass to you, you find yourself having played 1 pass throughout a game of 90 minutes.\n\nIt's cheap so if you enjoy the handheld version, you'll have a voice in your head urging you to buy this. However don't say I didn't warn you!\n\nOh yes, also the game keeps crashing. I've googled the error to no avail.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayresome/recommended/212780/","ayresome","Ayresome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayresome/","352 products in account","This is an arcadey football game with interesting RPG elements.\n\nYou are playing the part of a single footballer. That's a very refreshing mechanic, which hasn't been used in many other games recently. That makes this game fairly refreshing.\n\nThere are almost two games feeding into each other: Firstly, there's playing the matches. This is a good, but not stellar, arcade style football game, with a tiled view from behind the goal, similar to the various Amiga games of the 1990s. You just control your own player rather than the whole team. The game is fast-paced and holds your attention. The "one player" mechanic is also very different to most other games.\n\nSecondly, there's the RPG game. This has you "levelling up" your player, maintaining relationships with team mates and friends, saving up for houses, flash cars and the like. You can also do several other things, such as gamble your money at the casino or racetrack. The mini-games providing this are all very simple, but there are a lot of them and they're competently done.\n\nThe most interesting part comes where the two games overlap. Should you pass to a teammate rather than scoring yourself - because then he'll like you and be more likely to pass to you next time, or do you score yourself because you want the goal bonus to buy some new boots? When scoring a goal, do you celebrate with the fans to improve your relationship with them, or do you celebrate with the manager so he's more likely to pick you next week?\nI found this interesting and refreshing, and brings some planning and thinking to the arcade-style match engine.\n\nIf you're wondering whether this is the same game as its more famous cousin on iOS, it's not. This is much more fleshed out and playable, particularly the match engine which is real-time. Incidentally, if you haven't played the iOS version then it's well worth the price.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the game is nigh-on impossible to play using keyboard and mouse. You'll definitely need some kind of controller. I just used a cheap USB one, which worked absolutely fine. The buttons are user-definable.\n\nThe game does get a bit samey after a while - it's essentially the same game 20 hours in as it is 20 minutes in. However, at the price that's not a huge problem.\n\nI enjoyed playing this. If you like arcadey football games, or are bored of FIFA and want something different, then this is well worth a look.","November 28, 2013","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this as i thought it be text like the flash version.

You will struggle playing on a keyboard.\n3 - Signing in sometime's will not connect  DRM .\n4 - Abandoned long ago so there is no support.\n5 - Old style graphics and play style\n\nI came across a few bugs in 40 hours but none that was game breaking, I quite enjoyed this as it was a simple game\nwhich reminded me of a old playstation 1 footie game.\n\nIt has a few things to do like training skills/skill shots, going to the races and betting on horses, gambling at the casino and buying luxury items and properties.\n\nFor a 9.99 price tag this lets the reviews go sour which is fair enough as this is way over priced to the extent you are going to feel ripped off.\n\nGet this for under £4 and it's a bargin for an old style footie game !!!!","May 25","true","40.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
