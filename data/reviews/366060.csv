You use Teddy like a boomerang to slow down enemies (Think like Zelda with no DMG) and use it to make them go over traps or to trigger traps from a distance. They are a few power ups and guns and stuff also that you can grab and use once and a wile.The boss Fights are hardcore environment mayhem and mechanic based.So it really keeps you on your toes.The look of the game is real nice and retro and a bit whimsical,after all you are a kid running around with a teddy fighting monsters =D\n\nI say if you like challenging Rogue-likes give this a shot !! Ok i'm going to grab my Teddy now and say goodbye !! {whispers from under the covers} CHECK OUT THIS GAME !!!","May 26, 2015","true","0.9"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"

Its pretty easy to get used to the controls. I liked the nightmarish, but yet evily funny creatures and bosses. Gameplay is fun, killing monsters by leading them into traps and using items, which is a uniquely fresh idea. It does have a few bugs, like sometimes the mouse control would spaz out, and during some boss fights the screen would shake more then it should have. I certainly hope more is added, as the it is a bit short. Overall great game, definately worth the money. I look forward to seeing more content.","November 11, 2015","true","1.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

You must clear each room by destroying all enemies, however you get no weapons. Instead you rely on traps around the map to vanquish your nightmarish foes. You do have your trusty teddy bear though to use to activate switch based traps and to slow enemies to get them in the right position at the right time. The game looks similar in style to Nuclear Throne, but has little else in common other than its 2-D pixel-art aesthetic.\n\nThere is already a short tutorial in place to show you the basics of the game, but even though I played through it I felt I personally didn't need it. The game is quite simple but fun and includes a static upgrade system so eventually even if you keep dying you will improve your character. There are also many random items which will help you along the way, such as a toy gun (which actually isn't a toy at all) and other defensive and offensive items. I think the price is somewhat low for this title so I can easily recommend it.","May 21, 2015","true","0.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

I do no regret my purchase at all. Reminds me of binding of issac in a good refreshing way. Love that you have to really think of how to kill the enemies due to a lack of damaging projectile always available. The layout of the game is very promising and the soundtrack is VERY memorable. the art is notably eye catching too. I seriously reccomend buying this instead of some starbucks coffee. It is a hard game that is keeping me playing, and i cant wait to see what this game brings to the table later on in its development stages!","May 21, 2015","true","11.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","1"

Cant go wrong at this price point!\n\nThe game play is fast paced and quite unique compared to other Roguelite games.. its fun and interesting and the generated maps always have something different as well as the enemies that spawn. It is tough and unforgiving and I have yet to get to the final 2 stages! the enemy, item, and boss design is creative and sometimes hilarious.. I will be getting chased by a taco and a pizza.. while dropping lego's hopeing that they step on them. I still have more to see in this game and am excited to see what they add. For an early access game it is very polished and you defiently wont regret buying it at this stage. Comparing it to something like Binding of Isaac..  I much prefer this sort of creative enviromental combat as it is much more fun! Though the replay ability might not be on that level.. there is still a lot here and like i said i have yet to finish the game on NORMAL. I have also been told they plan on adding 5 alternate endings which will be great for extending the life of this game.. but at the moment there is only 1.\n\nThings I would like to see:\n\nMore options in the settings window. eg. Audio levels!!\nSimple cutscenes in between areas with voice over eg. the trailer for the game..\na little polishing here and there\nmore replayability options eg. Hard mode or something along those lines\nMore exposure. This game deserves a real good look!\n\n\n\nIf i was to give the game a score currently at its stage of development keeping in mind i have yet to complete it.\n\n7/10 ! lots of fun to be had.","May 23, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a little unusual as when I fail I upgrade and I don't know what those candy's do but I hope to figure it out later, this is a good game so far, well done.

So I decided to vote yes in hopes that it would one day make it to steam. I have waited a long time to see this game (In all truthfulness I forgot about it for the longest time so I missed out on its first public version) and it did not dissapoint me. The game is overall very fun and difficult once you get to the higher difficulties. All in all, I would say 10/10 would fall asleep and be sucked into the demon world again.","November 6, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Needs a few more mechanics to maintain interest. In it's current form you may get 1-2 hours of fun out of it. Also powerups need a menu to explain what powerups there are, and what they do. Because 'Candy Everyday' just doesn't seem to be straight forward enough.","January 13","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
