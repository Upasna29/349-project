"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/351490/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Intergalactic Bubbles is inspired by a game I don't remember the name but I can still see the cursor, the dinosaur and the bubble being sent. It's not  Bubble Bobble though I think there was an arcade version with a different gameplay. Anyway, I've known this game under different names, the last one being on a giveaway game where the minigame is called Blink Shooter and is my favorite.\n\nThe goal is to send colored balls on others of the same color to explode them and make sure that the board is cleaned before they're descending and touch your line. By doing so, you can also get rid of balls under them if they're not attached to another one that will support everything. Here, you have also the balls moving naturally, like if there was gravity and can also tied themselves to others and if they're the same color, you'll have another explosion that will probably help you to reach your goal.\n\nIntergalactic Bubbles is challenging because if you want to upgrade bonuses, you need to collect a sort of stars (that look more like a planet on fire anyway). Each level completed will give you one but if you do it less than the number if balls sent that will be displayed, you'll collect 3 or 2 stars.\n\nThe game is kinda long if you're aiming like me to a 3 stars. The more you advance, more balls will be on the board or a new color is added.\n\nWhile the graphics aren't spectacular and really simple, the soundtrack is correct.\n\nI suppose that some people will be deceived by the lack of features, but it's enough for me. I find the game a little too slow, mainly in the speed at which the board is descending.\n\nIf you love that kind of games, you can go for it, it's a nice disctraction.\n\nEdit: Apparently, the game was Bust-A-Move. The name itself is clicking in my head though I can't be sure if I was that.","November 28, 2015","true","4.7"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","6"

There's phyiscs that affects how the balls move.  Sometimes that ends up in your favor as a dangling trail of balls will swing back and forth and might attach to others which will activate them and make them explode.  Other times the physics is a hindrance when a dangling trail swings by at the wrong moment and grabs the ball you intended to go elsewhere.\n\nThere's an upgrade tree that you spend points on.  Get points by finishing a level in under a certain amount of balls spent.  You can replay levels any time as much as you want.\n\n3 Bonuses: Wild, Bomb, and Rocket.  Each time you make a match it starts to power up your bonus meter.  Once it is full you can choose a bonus to use.\n\nThis is a slower paced ball shooter than others I've played.  I find the emphasis to be more on strategy, especially if you want to use as few balls as possible to get the 3 star rating.  And sometimes you can waste a ball if you don't wait for the ones you just shot to fall because your new ball might attach to the falling ones.\n\nThere's no story, just fun arcade ball shooting.\n\nMusic is nice.  I like it.\n\nGraphics are okay.  I'm not picky about graphics, though.\n\nI find myself having to force myself to quit.

First of all, this has physics. The balls have weight and that means when a group is holding on with just 1 bubble connection, the whole group just swings a bit. The momentum goes away of course, but when it first goes in motion, it can either “catch” the ball you just shot (if you shot it) or it can connect to something else and if the balls are of the same colour, they act as a ball that you shot.\nSecond neat thing about this game are the upgrades and powerups. You upgrade your launcher to have energy which is gained by bubbles that fall down. Energy you use to activate powerups: launch ball ABOVE the “playground” to selected spot, use a rainbow ball or use a bomb. The powerups themselves are also upgradeable.\nThere are few flaws though, but they're rather minor. Graphics are a bit bad, too though, but gameplay is what counts. Gameplay first, graphics later.\n\nLil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqRybbmaQtI","October 19, 2015","true","2.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

After the first few/dozen levels, it largely depends on what bubbles you get and when, in order to get "full credit." Also, you can't see the end of the level until part-way through, meaning you could be wasting your time on an unsolvable level.\n2) The levels don't really mean much. Every time you retry, you get a new layout. Meaning it's all just randomly generated the whole game. The randomness of it ties into it not being skill-based.\n3) It's the OCD type of game where you want to keep trying until you get things perfect - which can be good - but there's no real reward. There's no plot to it, you don't have any goal you're working towards, and there's no reward other than 10 achievements. Each of those things on its own wouldn't be an issue, but it means the only point in playing is wasting time.\n\nI like the concept, and it can keep your brain occupied, but there are much better ways to waste time.","April 2","false","37.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

THAT's the big difficulty spike, 1 more color EACH GALAXY.\nNew colors are Light Blue, Yellow, Purple, and Orange.  Now, I'm not color blind, but I've mistaken the color of a ball several times.\n\nSo, Pros:\n1. Pretty fun bubble-blaster game\n2. Achievements (long, painful grind of 250 levels for all 10 of them tho!)\n3. Trading Cards, including (as of this review) a cheap collection of foil cards for a foil badge (still only 100 points, but THE PRESTIGE of a FOIL badge!)\n\nand Cons:\n1.  Completing this game totally is 250 levels, which is many many hours of grinding the same-looking screen and music over and over and over...  I recommend Netflix and iTunes or something similar in the background while grinding this.\n2. This game is NOT very friendly for people who are color-blind, I can't stress this enough!  New colors of balls in each new galaxy (on top of all the previous colors) is most of the difficulty spike in each new galaxy.\n\nand one weird pro/con glitch?:\n1. Occasionally (this has happened to me twice in 210 levels), a ball will glitch so bad at the corners of the game that it will set off a chain reaction of destruction that will destroy all but a few balls on that level.  This gives you a free (or mostly free) level, at the expense of messing your controls up and forcing you to exit and restart the game to regain normal controls.  Doesn't happen often enough to be useful, doesn't seem to hurt the game (aside from an almost mandatory relaunch), and will never happen when you're trying to replicate it to make a video of it to send to the developers' emails.  T_T\n\nVery very VERY fun to watch tho, as all the balls turn into oh so much confetti!  =^_^=\n\nSure, there might be better games out there, like some other reviewers suggest, but this game has trading cards and can be 100%'ed for achievements easily enough (even if it does take longer than some other games).  At only $2 USD, that's a bargain in my book!\n\nNOTE: Don't get the 4 game bundle, only this and maybe Fragile Ball are worth it.  Maybe Fragile Ball, maybe...  but definitely Intergalactic Bubbles!","May 26","true","26.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You match 3 bubbles of the same color to remove them from the board.  Doing so in a certain number of turns gets you a one to three star rating.  What makes this different from other puzzle games like this is the upgrades and physics.\n\nThe physics are interesting for this.  Once you remove three bubbles of the same color, the surrounding bubbles sway and if they collide with three or more of the same color, boom they are removed.  You can get a nice chain reaction going if done right and everything works out in your favor.\n\nUpgrades are also interesting.  You can use rockets, bombs, and other upgrades to remove certain "difficult areas".  This helps you get that 3 star rating you might be looking for in a certain stage.\n\nIf you enjoy this type of puzzle game, I highly recommend this.  There are quite a few levels to go through and it is different enough to make it worth your time.","November 1, 2015","true","25.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The gameplay has been done many times before. The graphics are very simple 3D, with a plain metal playing field and only a vaguely space-esque background to break up the monotony. The music is repetitive, non-melodic synth stuff. The one reasonably innovative thing is that the spheres hang together and swing around using some simple physics.\n\nYou can sit there and play for a while, and space out, and waste time...but afterwards you wonder why you even bothered.\n","January 24","false","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

On one hand, this game has such a cheap pricetag that there's really no way you could could not pick this up - especially when it's on sale. If you see this game on sale pick it up; but there's a few things that irk me about it.\n\nFirstly, the thing that I'm really not a huge fan about is how simplistic everything looks, evidently the game could be the nicest looking game out there and not really change anything.\n\nWhat you really should note about this game is that it is so simplistic to the point that yes, it is pure brilliance. I would even go as far as to say that this game is great. The main pointers about why it's so great is because; It's cheap, it's easy to run, there's not much of a learning curve and well, it's fun.\n\nDo get this game if it's on sale.

You shoot 'Planets' instead of bubbles, and you also have 3 Abilities. There's an upgrade menu, where you spend 'Stars', which is a currency you earn by completing levels, to upgrade various passive and active skills. You know how on mobile puzzle games, when you complete a level it gives you a rating of 1 to 3 stars depending on how well you did? It's like that here, and also has the standard square grid level select too. Each level you can earn up to 3 stars, which are used to upgrade your shield, energy regeneration and other energy stuff(energy is used to use abilities), actually purchasing the 3 abilities(they're cheap), and passive upgrades where you can use the various abilities together.\n\nThe 3 abilities are: "The Rocket", which basically throws the Planet above the others to land it somewhere further up, useful for when you want to drop a stack but can't reach it normally. The next ability is "The Wild", which is basically a multi-color Planet that can be matched with any other Planet. Then there's "The Bomb", which is like it sounds, you shoot it like a regular Planet and it destroys all Planets in a radius(that can be upgraded).\n\nI friggin' love this game. It's really fun and really cheap too. I definitely recommend it.","January 2","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Got it for $0.49 on sale.  Just can't beat the entertainment to cost ratio there.  Having said that, it does have a few issues.\n\n1.  The game is designed around "levels", although the levels are randomly generated.  So in reality, it is just luck whether you can get the three stars on any given level or not.  Sometimes you get a trivial layout and sometimes you don't, just restarting the same level.\n\n2. For some reason, the ball you are shooting changes color as it is being shot without warning, rhyme or reason.  This gets pretty frustrating.  I think this is a bug, but if it is a "feature" than the game needs to explain why it happens.\n\n3. There are "upgrades", "energy", "bombs", etc, but no real explanation on how or why you would want to use any of them.  I have completed about one and a half of the five galaxies so far at three stars, but have yet to use any of the power ups.\n\nOverall still a good casual time waster.\n\n6.5 / 10.","December 16, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So I decided to get a new game. I didn't have a lot of money left in my Steam account, and I need to find something with a low price. That's when I stumbled upon this hidden gem of a game. I have many fond memories of playing puzzle games similar to this one when I was younger, and the trailer of the game showed that it had to offer than the other bubble games created in the past; so I decided to give it a try. I found myself blazing through each level and having fun experimenting with the game's unique power up system. I am sure I will spend plenty of time playing this game if I find myself with a small window of free time, or I desire to play a game that is simply relaxing and stimulating for the brain. My only complaint I have so far with this game is that it bland soundtrack. I would suggest having some music that you enjoy playing in another window while playing this game.","February 21","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dynamics and tricks are quite simple and intuitive; background music and sounds are very nice. The special weapons and combinations added a new layer to an old-type game.\n\nPROs:\n- Commands and dynamics are really easy to grasp. You likely won't need the step-by-step introduction - but it's there, neverthless, if you need it.\n- Music and sounds. Like I said, they did a great job with it. They can be easily muted and regulated through the game, too.\n- Special weapons and their combinations. Nothing is as viscerally satisfying as being able to get the whole table to explode with just one move.\n\nCONs:\n- The level of simplicity. Really, the whole game is almost too easy. You get almost at once the right, intuitive combination of exploding bubbles and special weapons needed to pass the harder levels. Conversely, the last sector is literally impossible to win with full stars and without special weapons; you'd need to try and try and try again until you get a lucky screen.\n- The colours. Blue, green and red, all right. But, add the yellow one to the mix and it gets really hard to pick them apart - and I'm not even vaguely color-blind. (And then comes the orange... no, really. There were moments when I had to stop and look at them a second time.)\n\nGoing just by genre, I'd say 8/10. As a more general vote, a nice 7/10. I'll be likely re-playing this sometimes soon and I've already suggested it to other players.","March 2","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nevertheless, such clones are invariably entertaining because their core idea is so good, and if they manage to give it some nice twist, they can expect some real popularity.\nThis is exactly what Intergalactic Bubbles does: by taking the concept of "put balls of the same colour together to make them disappear" and adding real physics, as well as some special moves and buyable upgrades, it provides a surprisingly good gaming experience. Yes, each level is virtually the same, but it's just this kind of game - it's pointless to expect anything else from it. It is what it is, and the repetitiveness is a feature like any other, not a shortcoming. What matter is that it's fun to shoot the balls, look for combinations, buy new skills and watch the balls swing quasi-realistically (hopefully with unexpected combos).\nThe game has no major weak points, but the graphics aren't exactly pretty, which is a shame for this kind of game (especially visible on Steam cards, which I've melted to crystals as soon as possible before my eyes could bleed). I also have some reservations regarding balance of power-ups (for example, bomb costs more energy despite being less useful than multi-coloured ball), but it has very little impact on the actual gameplay.\nTo sum up: Intergalactic Bubbles is a game for many, many evenings, but only if you don't mind doing the same thing over and over. But it never hurts to try, especially since the game is addictive as hell.","January 16","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On a simple level, this is taking the classic Bust-a-Move game style and putting it in a 3d situation. It does do that, and for the price, I'd say it's definitely worth the money, but I do have to say that there's some missteps with the game.\n\nFirst of all, Bust-a-Move had a lot of interesting level design, something that's entirely absent here. There's 5 'worlds' of 50 levels each, and each new world adds an extra color into the mix. However, within a world, every single level is basically the same, you have solid rows of bubbles and higher levels simply have more rows. As the number of rows increments slowly, this means that every single level in a world feels basically the same as the one before it. It ends up feeling very monotonous and repetitive, and even a handful of change-ups in there would make it more engaging. The other issue in this vein is the power-up system. There's really too many options in the power-ups, and it somewhat bothers me that having beaten the game, I can't unlock everything on the power-up tree. There is also that by having the right power-ups, the game goes from very challenging, to beating every level in about half the required shots. I flew through about the last 20 levels because of the right power-up combination making this, imo, too easy.\n\nThere's also a few issues with the rendering. The shots that take advantage of the 3rd dimension seem to have a nasty habit of getting stuck somewhere slightly earlier than what the arrow would indicate, which is really frustrating. There is also that the bubbles don't always handle occupying the same space well, and you can have a chain reaction of glitches virtually clear the board sometimes. I beat levels in only about 10 shots a few times because a glitch would happen in one corner, and take out the entire field. It basically finishes the level for you, so on one hand, that's sort of convenient and it's a bit harder to get made about it, but on the other hand it's a bit frustrating and it sometimes meant that I had to restart the game to get the controls working normally again.\n\nOverall, while there's a few interesting mechanics on top of the classic Bust-a-move (such as using momentum of bubbles to make connections), it's a bit lacking, but still good entertainment for the price (a buck or two)","January 17","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Usually, if I'm looking at something not intentionally throwback, it means that the developers didn't want to take the time to add polish to the game.  And then... the music.  The music is this generic couldabeen music that is designed to slip into the background and quietly suck there.

I had some frustration with not being able to flip the balls, but I did like the physics 'touch' that was added to it.  The game itself is rather hyptnotic...

You shoot 'Planets' instead of bubbles, and you also have 3 Abilities. There's an upgrade menu, where you spend 'Stars', which is a currency you earn by completing levels, to upgrade various passive and active skills. You know how on mobile puzzle games, when you complete a level it gives you a rating of 1 to 3 stars depending on how well you did? It's like that here, and also has the standard square grid level select too. Each level you can earn up to 3 stars, which are used to upgrade your shield, energy regeneration and other energy stuff(energy is used to use abilities), actually purchasing the 3 abilities(they're cheap), and passive upgrades where you can use the various abilities together.\n\nThe 3 abilities are: "The Rocket", which basically throws the Planet above the others to land it somewhere further up, useful for when you want to drop a stack but can't reach it normally. The next ability is "The Wild", which is basically a multi-color Planet that can be matched with any other Planet. Then there's "The Bomb", which is like it sounds, you shoot it like a regular Planet and it destroys all Planets in a radius(that can be upgraded).\n\nI friggin' love this game. It's really fun and really cheap too. I definitely recommend it.","January 2","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Too many unnecessary repetitive levels, the constant annoying tune playing in the background throughout the game,and a upgradable weaponary system to make the stages even more simplistic then it already is.

And why is that? Read this review for god sake!! XD\n\nBut anyways, if you ever saw this game before in the store, and you thought ''Oh, just a normal Buuble Shooter game, again, meh''. I understand your reaction. I had the same reaction when I first saw the game. Then the game was in sale, and since it was like 23 cents I think, I bought it.\n\nWhen I first played it, oh I see, an Unity game... I wasnt expecting much now...\n\nBut when I played my first game, you can, unlike other bubble shooters, combo your shots. And this is what makes the game AMAZING. Its so fun and satisfying to do these combos!!! The idea is very well-thought. This is the best bubble shooter game I ever played. But wait, theres more.\n\nThe music is calm, and fits very well for a game in space (Its INTERGALATIC Bubbles). Heck, I would love to have the soundtrack actually.\n\nThe controls are great and perfect. Nothing more to say. No controller support, but who wants to play a bubble shooter with a controller?\n\nThe 3D graphics are very enjoyable even though they are simple. The simple look of the graphics makes the game run very smoothly, and smooth gameplay is a very good thing.\n\n\nIn conclusion, your wallet will be very happy after you buy this game. Its worth the price. Trust me. This is probably the best bubble shooter game around.\n\n101% RECOMMENDED!!!!!!","February 27","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An incredibly simple game, at its core, but, with a twist. It has about 250 Levels and will last quite a while (It took me 3 Hours to get past the first 50 Levels). This game has power ups which allow for a unique twist to the Bubble Shooter Genre. One allows you to place it anywhere in the area, one is a Universal Ball, and the other, which I forget. There is also a layer of physics here as well. You can bounce the Ball off a wall and ricochet it to hit where you want, if you're good enough to do that. Furthermore, you can upgrade the Abilities when you have points, which will give you better uses for the Ability. You can even combine the Abilities later in the game when you get far enough. I would definently recommend this game if you like the Bubble Shooter Genre. It is Cheap, fun, unique, and definently worth every penny.","June 3","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
